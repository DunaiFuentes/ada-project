Do you realize what ""current account surplus"" actually means?  
Having an account surplus means that a part of the work done wasn't paid. More precisely, it was paid in foreign liabilities (ie. worthless paper or electronic balance) and wasn't converted to actual, useful stuff.  

It's bad for the economy, unless it's a deliberate long-term dumping strategy (which would later cover the current loses). The increase in gdp is true, the stuff was produced, but it was given away for free - which means that an increase in gdp doesn't mean an increase in living standard and wealth (possibly even a decrease).  

Euro isn't good for Germany, it's good for *statistics*. Everybody can find employment if he's willing to work for free, hence small unemployment.   

In specific inter-euro case, Southern Europeans are buying German stuff, paying with euro, then the Germans loan them the money they got from them, then they buy stuff again, eventually they can't pay, then Germany gives them money. The net effect is that for several years you were just working for free for them. That's the supposed Germany's ""advantage of being in Eurozone"". :) And the only thing you get from beneficiaries is hate.

true,balanceofpain,null,null,"&gt; Ströbele setzt sich schon seit Jahren für eine bessere parlamentarische Kontrolle der Geheimdienste ein.

Das ist mir wohlbewusst.  Auch tun das viele, Resultate sehe ich dennoch keine, und die dünne Argumentationsweise lässt mich zu dem Schluss kommen, dass solche Bestrebungen bloße Feigenblätter sind.  Ströbele sitzt seit 1999 im PKGr.  Gleichzeitig war er Teil der Regierungsfraktionen eines Innenministers, der als Reaktion auf die Plutonium-Affäre [1996 noch die Einrichtung eines Geheimdienstbeauftragten mit zugehöriger Behörde von ca. 100 Mitarbeitern gefordert hatte](http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/geschaeftsfuehrer-struck--bisherige-kontrollmoeglichkeiten-nicht-ausreichend-spd-fordert-geheimdienstbeauftragten,10810590,9147822.html).  Geschehen ist dennoch nichts.  Und Ströbele kann sich nicht damit herausreden, dass er damals ja erst seine erste Legislaturperiode im PKGr hatte, also noch unerfahren war: erst ist Rechtsanwalt im linken Milieu und war Strafverteidiger von RAF-Terroristen.  Der wusste schon damals sehr genau Bescheid darüber, wie mächtig Geheimdienste waren, und inwieweit ihre Kontrolle verbesserungswürdig war.

An der gegenwärtig ablaufenden Affäre nervt mich, dass er sich auf die Person Snowdens fixiert, und dass darunter seine Arbeit in der Sache kaum Beachtung findet.  Wie viele Menschen werden Notiz davon genommen haben, dass Ströbele auch an die Select Committees on Intelligence der USA geschrieben hat, um den Vorschlag einer besseren Zusammenarbeit von diesen mit dem PKGr zu unterbreiten?  Auch spart er die Überwachungspraxis deutscher Dienste in merkwürdiger Weise aus und beschränkt sich darauf, die NSA für ihre Praxis anzugehen.  Warum weist er nicht einmal laut und deutlich, gern auch wiederholt darauf hin, dass die deutschen Dienste mit den Briten und den Amis kooperiert haben, dass die Empörung nun also Heuchelei ist?  Warum keilt er nicht mal mit voller Wucht gegen Thomas Oppermann und reißt ihm seine Heuchlermaske vom Gesicht, denn er war es maßgeblich, der sich nach der NSU-Affäre gegen eine signifikante Ausweitung parlamentarischer Kontrollbefugnisse sperrte?

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Das ist mir wohlbewusst. 
&gt; 
&gt; Nein, ist es nicht. Dein Kritikpunkt war, dass sich Ströbele nicht mit der Frage beschäftigt, wie Geheimdienste besser kontrolliert werden können:

Das war mein Kritikpunkt überhaupt nicht.  Wie Ströbele gebetsmühlenartig nach Verbesserung der Geheimdienstkontrolle zu rufen, reicht nicht aus.  Er sollte die Frage beantworten: Wie viel Verbesserung der Geheimdienstkontrolle wäre *genug, und warum*?

&gt; &gt; Ich würde mir wünschen, dass Herr Ströbele sich der Erörterung dieser nicht ganz unkomplizierten Frage widmen würde.

Nichts von dem, was Du hier vorgebracht hast, hat in irgendeiner Weise mit der von mir oben formulierten Frage zu tun.  Dass Du das trotzdem so siehst, zeigt, dass sinnentnehmende Rezeption nicht zu Deinen Stärken gehört.  Das einzige, was Du an halbwegs Substanziellem vorgebracht hast, war ein Artikel, in dem Ströbele als ein Autor eine Liste von Sicherheitsgesetzen aufstellte und diese mal mehr, mal weniger undifferenziert ablehnte, ohne zu erwähnen, was er akzeptieren würde.  Um Abwägungskriterien oder Kriterien zur Abschätzung der Effektivität von Kontrolle ging es dabei nicht, auch nicht um die Beantwortung der in der obigen implizit enthaltenden Frage ""Warum so und nicht anders?"", aber genau darum müsste es gehen.

&gt; Dein Beitrag zum Thema beschränkt sich auf Motzerei, während Ströbele sich seit Jahren nachweislich genau der Frage widmet, derer er sich deiner Aussage nach verweigert.

So etwas kann nur jemand sagen, für den die bloße Produktion von Text schon ein Nachweis für ausreichende Arbeit und jedwede Form von Kritik Motzerei ist.  Im Übrigen würde sich Dein Beitrag zum Thema dann von vornherein darauf beschränken, vermeintlichen Motzern ihre Motzerei vorwerfen zu können: Motzerei zweiter Ordnung sozusagen

This argument could just aswell be used by me. 

&gt; And better ways like giving money only to people who don't work so they don't have incentive to take a low-paying job and lose their free money?

First of all this system would change nothing, secondly the giving money to people who don't work is not quite accurate. It's for people that have lost their job, it's to support them for a while - by paying them an amount of money they have previously earned by paying taxes - based upon their previous income but less - which gets lower and lower after more time passes. Now what you want to do is exactly this, fair enough you would keep the ''free money'' (there is no such thing) and instead make a little bit more money by working. It's the same but worse since it's for everyone.

&gt; It is less obvious, but much more sensible to admit that you may not have thought about this enough and may not have the knowledge to be certain one way or another.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Spain is one of the bigger producers of vehicles

If I'm buying a car, the decision is made between BMW/Mercedes/Audi (actually not that, only boring people drive Audis)/Lexus/Cadillac. People who think of buying a Seat are people who make choice between Skoda/Kia/Citroen/Peugeot/Renault, etc... The point in here is that German producers and Spanish producers are not competing in the same market.

&gt; That was financed by crazy levels of private debt; those levels were posible to lower rates to support German reunification and capital flowing also from German and French banks. The EU meant that Spain wasn't able to raise the interests.

First of all, Spain had multiple ways to decrease construction, but failed to do to. The first order would have been to shutdown public constructions projects, the second thing would have been to limit building permits, put new taxes to raise the price of new construction. There were cures, but the reason why there cures were not taken because politicians, businessmen and union leaders didn't want to deal with the real problem, Spanish competitiveness, and instead choose to cover up the economic situation with huge construction bubble.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"You are wrong at that. Public entities like states, regional governments, cities and municipalities can own public services, but they have to do that by incorporating those services to companies that they then own. 

The reason why incorporating is needed is to increase transparency and prevent illegal public subsidies. For example lets say that public utilities would function as part of city government, then lets imagine that a company is contemplating on making a big investment to the city, but for them electricity or water price is key decision maker, now as the electricity provider/water provider is part of the city, the city can decide to entice the investor to invest into the city by providing subsidies in form of lower than production cost water/electricity prices. This leads to sub-optimal resource allocation and taxpayers loosing money.

Now when water works, electricity network operations, etc.. have been incorporated to companies of their own, those companies need to be profitable per see, the city can't float money to them via back door when they making looses, thus public interference to daily operations and markets are minimized. 

Another thing to note is that in many places where utilities are directly part of city, things such as maintenance or replacing old infrastructure can be lacking as these operations usually need more money which means bigger municipal taxes which politicians don't like at all. That is actually one the reason why when incorporating public utilities to companies prices tend to rise, they rise because these utilities were neglected and now as utilities can't anymore make losses, they need to cover their expenses from the money they get from users.",0,1383386860,null,0,false,0,cd50w1d,t3_1ppjfx,t1_cd50w1d,t1_cd50et5,null,1428890339,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Comunque ci sono tre grosse str...anezze che bastano e avanzano a farmi ritenere l'articolo come ""una cagata pazzesca"" (cit.).

1) Affinché il ""virus"" si propaghi, un computer dovrebbe avere qualcosa che gli accenda il microfono (visto che è spento di default) e lo predisponga alla ricezione di dati audio ed interpretarli come codice eseguibile. Se fa ciò vuol dire che è già stato infettato da una backdoor, quindi paradossalmente l'eventuale ""contagio"" potrebbe solo avvenire fra macchine già infette e ciò è evidentemente assurdo e non spiega come far arrivare la backdoor sul computer da infettare.

2) Com'è che sto fantomatico virus si propaga cross-platform, usando lo stesso codice per ogni sistema operativo? Come ci arriva alla ""memoria flash di base""? Deve comunque passare dal S.O. del PC che sta infettando, o mi sbaglio? E quindi, se ci passa attraverso, ha diversi codici che si attivano a seconda del S.O.?

Prouver qu'un phénomène de fond existe, ça n'est pas facile, surtout quand ça relève de faire de l'anthropologie sur sa propre culture et au temps présent.

C'était peut être sensationnaliste, mais je reste sous l'impression que la mentalité majoritaire en France par rapport à l'argent (et contrairement aux fameux pays anglo-saxons, car ça n'a de sens que lorsqu'on compare à ce qui se fait ailleurs) est influencée par un fond culturel catholique d'une part et par l'influence du marxisme chez nous au 20ème siècle d'autre part. D'ailleurs je pense que cette double influence prend une forme plus sociale-démocrate/""démocratie chrétienne"" que marxiste.

Si tu es d'accord avec cette analyse, on peut ensuite bien sûr ne pas être d'accord de se prononcer si c'est une bonne ou une mauvaise chose.

These real Aryans were of course not a good example to the race theories of Hitler and Mussolini so they had to be exterminated too. Relatively there were even fewer survivors after WWII than Jews.

My point is that those fair traits are more common than you think. This is just a continuance of the prejudices and even harassment and petsecution that the Sinti and Roma have undergone through the ages. Just accept that they just do some things other than us and especially our red tape that got them persecuted no less than a century ago.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Der Ausdruck ""gestört fühlen"" ist für mich in diesem Fall nicht zutreffend. Es ist eher eine Frage des persönlichen Stils.

Meine persönlichen Vorstellungen unterscheiden sich teilweise klar von den Anforderungen, die ich an Andere, also die Gesellschaft, stelle. Und zuweilen bin ich sehr gerne bereit, meine eigenen Wünsche und Interessen im öffentlichen Raum den jeweiligen Begebenheiten anzupasssen und auch unterzuordnen. Ich nenne das hier Solidarität und ich tue das nicht ohne Eigennutz. Auch halte ich mich nicht für außergewöhnlich.

Ein Beispiel, das den Punkt, nicht nur oberflächlich, ganz klar verfehlt, ist ein Trauerfall in der Nachbarsfamilie. Selbst ein unbetroffener Mensch passt dann für eine gewisse Zeit im nicht-privaten Raum sein Verhalten an, signalisiert so Rücksicht und verzichtet damit auf einige seiner Freiheiten. Was dann kurz nach dieser symbolischen Geste in den eigenen vier Wänden geschieht, interessiert die Trauergemeinde in der Regel nicht.

Ein anderes Beispiel: In aller Regel verhält sich ein Gast dann vollkommen freiwillig rücksichtsvoll und ruhig, wenn bekannt ist, dass eine Person im Hause Ruhe braucht und schlafen möchte. 

Doch auch dieser Vergleich hinkt.

Am treffendsten finde ich einen Vergleich mit den Ladenöffnungszeiten; an bestimmten Tagen dürfen bestimmte Geschäfte keinen Handel betreiben. Das trifft es am ehesten, denn die Cindy reist nicht aus reiner Liebe für ihre Nächsten nach Augsburg und mietet dort ne Halle - sie tut das, um Geld zu verdienen, um sich frisch zu machen, wie die Wiener sagen.

 Und sie kann das das ganze Jahr über. Soweit ich das als Außenstehender weiß, sind es zwei Tage im November und der Karfreitag, an denen in einigen Bundesländern laute Musik und ausgelassenes Feiern in der Öffentlichkeit untersagt sind.

Das ist also der Preis, den ich zu bezahlen habe, an diesen Tagen: Ein Verzicht auf das, was ich an 360 oder mehr Tagen im Jahr so oder so schon habe oder haben kann. Ich verzichte allerdings nicht komplett auf alle Vergnügungsmöglichkeiten im öffentlichen Raum: Kneipen, Restaurants, Clubs werden nicht gezwungen zu schließen; sie sind nur angehalten, dem Motto des Tages entsprechend, die Lautstärke anzupassen. So, als ließe man an diesen Tagen der aufgeblasenen Vergnügungsindustrie die Luft raus.

An diesen Tagen herrscht kein Kleidungszwang, es müssen keine Rituale vollzogen werden, der Tagesablauf kann von jedem selbst bestimmt werden.

Und weshalb lasse ich mich nun auf diesen Handel ein? Welchen Nutzen habe ich davon?

Wäre ich Arbeitnehmer in einem anderen Bundesland, hätte ich einen zusätzlichen freien Tag, den ich für mich ausfüllen und nutzen könnte.

The point is that there aren't Spanish producers and Spanish and German workers are competing in the same market.

That's true. We did too many public construction projects. Even if we had a surplus in the budget(we had one due to all the cyclic income due to the housing) there were better usages for the money. 

Furthermore, we didn't do a project that the EU has been asking for since 20 years  the rail freight transport with international  gauge with France going through Catalonia and all the Mediterranean. And that's one of the things that the Catalonian government uses against  Spain.

It's funny because we liberalized the sector cutting the time for starting to built from years to months removing most of the public planning and analysis. And the EU was very happy about that back in the day.

&gt; put new taxes to raise the price of new construction.

The taxes were high enough to be near 20% of the public administration income(at least that was the drop that we had in 2009 against 2007 in tax collection), maybe they could be even higher, the prices were rising 15% per year between 1999 and 2006. An extra 5% in taxes seems like a small drop.

Geheimdienste spionieren entweder die eigene Bevölkerung, oder das Ausland aus.

Wenn das Ausland ausspioniert wird:

Nehmen wir doch mal an, es passiert etwas, dass wir Deutschen nicht gut finden in der Welt. Was tun wir dann? Angreifen? Dazu ist unsere Armee nicht in der Lage und wir wollen es auch gar nicht. Wenn wir es wollten - Afrika ist voll von Ungerechtigkeit, Leid und dem ein oder anderen Diktator. Interessiert uns offenbar nicht. Wozu ein Geheimdienst der weiß was in der Welt passiert, wenn wir dann eh nichts dagegen unternehmen wollen?

Wenn die eigene Bevölkerung ausspioniert wird:

Gehts noch ein bisschen gefährlicher? Geheimdienstleute sind auch nur Menschen, sie wollen gebraucht werden und eine wichtige, wertvolle Arbeit leisten. Außerdem vergrößert eine unbestimmte Bedrohungslage das Budget, Personal wird aufgestockt, mehr Personal braucht mehr Führungsleute, mehr benötigte Führungsleute bedeuten Aufstiegschancen und ganz real mehr Geld in der Geldbörse des individuellen Geheimdienstlers. 

Was passiert also? Die Bedrohung wird aufgeblasen oder zur Not direkt erfunden. Kann man sich selbst gegenüber auch prima rechtfertigen, es könnte ja jederzeit eine echte Bedrohung des Weges kommen, dann ist man schonmal vorbereitet. Man handelt also nur im Interesse aller.

Und wieder verkleinern kann einen Geheimdienst im Ernstfall niemand. Die Leute spionieren uns alle aus, könnte ja jeder (natürlich nicht alle - nur jeder) ein Terrorist sein. Sie wissen also, wer welche dreckige Wäsche im Schrank hat. Da setzen die sich sicher nicht hin und akzeptieren, dass irgendein Politiker sie einfach so abschafft.

&gt;This and a an increasing demand due to the rising purchasing power would would cause a general rise in prices that would equalize the Basic Income, making it useless. 

Yeah that's a legitimate problem, probably requiring the outlaw of large rises in price. Government would then set the threshold between what's considered a natural (market driven) price increase, and a malicious one (everyone has more money, therefore I can/should/will raise prices).

This is more likely to happen for local businesses rather than international business doing business outside the EU. I could see a citizen's response to boycott stores that do this, however.

Case in point:

Just imagine, however, if there was a way to detect this at birth, and that a law was enacted which forced doctors to label babies gay or lesbian on their birth certificates. Would this be helpful to them or their families?

___
&gt; c) how would you finance it

Answer: the point of the initiative is to have a feasibility study, but those starting the initiative think that sufficient financing will come from 1) the existing welfare programs, 2) a luxury tax, 3) higher financial industry taxes.

Aristote était un esclavagiste qui ne voyait pas les femmes comme des citoyens. Et alors ? Il est à l'origine de la principale révolution du domaine qui a crée le plus de contenu intellectuel en deux millénaires.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; and the absence of a strong State

That's not actually true. A state's authoritarianism and power increases as material conditions worsen. When times are good, it's easy to rule by consensus and by abiding to a welfare-centric social contract. When times are tough, the state resorts to using force and bypassing democratic procedures more and more to implement its policies. 

Therefore, if anything, fascism flourishes when you have a strong state, not a weak one. Hitler got his increased emergency powers because the state was already granting emergency powers left and right to keep things under control. 

&gt; If the death of racist, xenophobic aggressors can be twisted into some message of oppression and martyrdom that appeals to the majority of citizens, then we have a far larger problem on our hands than just the deaths in themselves.

This is the point where you're making the most serious mistake, I think. You describe this as a remote possibility whereas this is exactly the world we're living in. 

Let me explain: Suppose that for you even the slightest risk of fascism is so abhorrent that you have no qualms over using any means necessary to stop it, therefore justifying the use of lethal force. However, most people appraise this risk as something far less costly than you (e.g. they might think the risk is so minuscule that it's not worth sacrificing human lives to mitigate it). 

Now, if you start killing fascists left and right, all these people will be alienated by your actions and it will be impossible for them to understand why you would do such a thing. Which of course creates this image of martyrdom and paints you as the bad guy. 

(As a sidenote, also consider this psychological perspective: If you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back into you. The means you employ to achieve some goal affect the goal itself. For example, the Bolsheviks created a highly hierarchical organisation to overthrow hierarchical oppression and look what happened to the Soviet Union. Fascism's goal is to violently dispose of all different voices and unite everyone into a single cause. By employing this same tactic (violently dispose of all fascists), are you sure you're not further legitimising their ideology?)",0,1383405717,null,0,false,0,cd544mj,t3_1ppde3,t1_cd544mj,t1_cd53mzt,null,1428888828,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,FrisianDude,FRIE,Friesland,"Ooh. I hadn't noticed the apple-map had Frisian as 'apel'. Honestly, at home I didn't speak Frisian as such but Bildtish, so I'm not sure if it IS apel (which is actually new to me). But if it is indeed apel then 'sinesapel' doesn't seem that odd. But it probably depends a bit on the individual speaker whether they pronounce it 'appel' (which via the enormous influence of Dutch would probably be quite common). 

I looked it up on http://www.wurdboek.nl/ but unfortunately I can't link to it directly, but if you enter ""appel"" in Nl -&gt; Fr it presents both 'appel' and 'apel' but with most examples of use using 'appel'.  And, alternatively, putting 'apel' in Fr -&gt; Nl just gives ""see appel"" .

I'm thinking the difference might mainly be in what a speaker is used to, syllable-stress can vary a bit by region, so 'apel' might simply be 'appel' but with the stress on the a. 

However, it might interest you that typing 'sinesap' in the search bar only presents 'sinesappel' with both p's. I presume this might also be due to syllable stress; putting the stress on the 'a' in 'sinesappel' might not be the most natural thing to try for most speakers and, as such, it's not included as a legit form. 

Though I'm hardly a legit scholar and student of the language (my knowledge is in fact sorely lacking) I think /u/Lemno's post might be based on what they're used to rather than what might be most common/most accepted.

&gt;&gt;er quarto pe' li disperati""

&gt;""The first one is for those who are in a hurry;
the second is for the married couple;
the third is for lovers;
the fourth is for the desperate ones""

&gt;In the popular tradition this is the rhyme that should be recited eating maritozzi. Maritozzi are typical roman sweets made by bakers with yeast and cooked in stone ovens. Their name derives from the fact that those sweets were given to the girlfriends by young boys.
In fact, usually golden gifts were hidden inside them.

EDIT:

Another cantilena having maritozzo is:

Standpunkte bekommt man raus indem man mit ihnen redet, auch die Wirtschaftssituation ist durchaus öffentlich. Ich glaube da sind eher Diplomaten gefragt.

I personally like about basic income that it is a potential replacement for a whole elaborate government system providing everyone in need with what they need. As such it could potentially bring taxes down, not up! And there are no conclusive academic studies that I am aware of that either prove or disprove that. Something like the initiative for basic income in europe will, if it succeeds, result in more studies like this. If the studies show the superiority of the swedish model of a welfare state over the basic income solution, then this matter will be settled. Won't that be a good thing?

Some other countries could also have an easier time implementing basic income than a swedish-style welfare state. I use words like could, but if you show me academic studies disproving the things I said could be true, I would not have to. I think the benefit of having the european union coming up with such studies, and the chance for improving many countries' welfare systems in a real sense, not just by ""rising taxes more until everyone gets a lot"", is worth the costs from the european union's budget.

Ah, poi sempre nel 2000 o giu di lì c'era un esperimento degli 883 (sì lo so, abbiate pazienza, ero rEgazzino), che era una specie di *Second Life*, in cui entravi, ti creavi un avatar e giravi a spasso per quel mondo virtuale (in 3D! all'epoca!), in cui potevi fare poco altro che andare in giro e chattare, che però per l'epoca era veramente notevole. Si chiamava 883D (ovviamente), non ricordo se .it o .com o altro. Non lo visitai più di tanto perché frequentato da rEgazzini ancora più rEgazzini di me e non c'era gusto, però l'idea era innovativa e IMHO merita di essere ricordato fra le perle del web italiano.

On the one hand I absolutely sympathise with and understand the want for a better life. And yeah, I bet that most of them would make good citizens and societal contributors if given half the chance. Plus, the amount of deaths that has occurred is horrible. People have the right to a decent life, regardless of their country of origin.

But on the other hand (and I do feel guilty saying this) why should we do something about people dying outside our borders? It's not our jurisdiction. And while it is awful, we simply don't have the logistics (nor, when it comes down to it, the heart) needed to take in everyone who thinks Europe is the land of milk and honey. With these in mind, why do we have to take them in? Why should we?

Perhaps a different approach is needed? I imagine investing in and improving North Africa might be feasible. Not only would it lessen the amount of people wanting to come here (by improving their lives over there) but it would also create a new trading partner.

In passato ho visitato altri siti italiani che ora non frequento più. Su due piedi ricordo:

-Il forum di gamesradar, all'epoca (2005-2008, forse 2009) valeva la pena perderci tempo. C'era una buona utenza in varie sezioni (musica, discussioni serie in generale) che nel tempo è stata allontanata da scelte amministrative non sempre eccelse e, personalmente, anche da disinteresse secondo me. L'ultima volta che ne ho sentito parlare è stato tempo fa, quando ha cambiato nome e ha ammazzato la metà delle riviste collegate a seguito di una nuova gestione.

-Alcuni forum di forumfree ""privati"" di ambito musicale, defunti a seguito di numerose morti e resurrezioni, che erano tra le poche cose di forumfree che valessa la pena seguire se si voleva discutere seriamente di musica. L'utenza è finita in diaspora e io personalmente ho preferito chiudere totalmente.
Funfact: anni fa sono stato il diretto responsabile dell'implosione di un forum musicale presente sulla piattaforma. E ci moderavo pure da 10 giorni. All'epoca la cosa la trovai ilare. 

-Hwupgrade, all'epoca era il primo forum italiano.

-Yahoo answers. Può sembrare una stronzata immane metterlo in questa lista (lo è per certi versi), ma c'è stato un periodo (2007 forse) in cui si poteva trovare gente competente nelle sezioni musicali (nella massa di ritardati che postano in quel puttanaio), dove facendo una domanda potevi ricevere delle risposte abbastanza interessanti. Poi al di fuori di quello faceva cagare e fa cagare ancora abbondantemente, io per primo mi ero iscritto per fare una domanda su come sciogliere un tipo di colla e avevo ricevuto delle risposte veramente del cazzo.

No, it is up to *you* to prove it, it is not up to me to disprove it. You are asking me basically to prove that ""this will not happen"". I can't prove that, ever, no one can, so it is up to *you* to prove stuff. It is impossible for me to prove a negative you see.


&gt;I personally like about basic income that it is a potential replacement for a whole elaborate government system providing everyone in need with what they need

So, what is lacking in Sweden? What is lacking in Switzerland? What is lacking in Norway? Denmark? In detail, please.

&gt;As such it could potentially bring taxes down, not up!

According to what academic study. Otherwise, you are just pulling things out of the air, prove that statement!

&gt;And there are no conclusive academic studies that I am aware of that either prove or disprove that.

Again, I am assuming that you have never ever studied anything past high school because you should know then how one proves things and that it is impossible to prove a negative. 


&gt; and the chance for improving many countries' welfare systems in a real sense, not just by ""rising taxes more until everyone gets a lot"", is worth the costs from the european union's budget.

No, raising taxes can be very bad, depending on what taxes and what context. Furthermore, if you want the EU to raise them, we are talking a *whole* different ballgame. I am sure you are aware that it is illegal, and that it would mean a completely new treaty that needed to be approved by all countries, plus that I think in almost all cases (I know for Sweden is it true) it would mean changing in the constitutions, since it would essentially mean the end of the individual states. Do you want that really? Why? 

The fact that you have no academic studies and frankly, are asking me to disapprove things, instead of proving them themselves, which is the correct way, tells me you have no clue what you, or any of those people are talking about, none of you can even have gone to university, then you should no that the burden of proof is on you, not on me. I think the proposal is absolutely madness, and your answers only make me more sure of that.

Vero. Anche i blog, che sono spuntati più tardi, come ho scritto incidentalmente prima, sono stilisticamente standardizzati: è vero che ci sono i temi, ecc., ma le strutture sono sempre quelle.

Sui siti classici (cosiddetto web 1.0, prendiamo per buona quest'espressione) quei pochi che si facevano un sito lo facevano veramente come pareva a loro, c'era l'anarchia totale.

In più, quei pochi che avevano un sito erano, generalmente, decisamente più nerd della media.

L'espressione ""web 2.0"" non dovrebbe riferirsi al fatto che tutti possono aggiungere contenuti sulla Rete, invece che usufruirne e basta, come è il senso attuale. Secondo me la differenza sostanziale fra web 1.0 e 2.0 è che ora anche chi non è molto pratico di computer può riversare contenuti.

L'allargamento esponenziale della base ha portato necessariamente ad un abbassamento di livello nella qualità dei contenuti.

Nei due decenni scorsi, nessuno si sognava di dire quello che ha mangiato la sera prima, o che è fidanzato/a e con chi, quando è andato al cesso, ecc., ovviamente documentando il tutto con foto.

Se uno creava un sito era perché aveva qualcosa da dire. Giusto o sbagliato, non fa niente, ma almeno aveva un po' più di significato. Ora su fb sono più le persone che nascondo dal feed di quelle che seguo, perché onestamente fottesega (cit.) di cosa ha fatto Tizio o Caia, e perché non ho voglia di trovarmi citazioni di Fabio Volo sul monitor.

&gt;here are proposals for financing basic income.

OK. Explain then in detail how it is going to be financed in Sweden please.

&gt;Why do you not want to even find out? Why are you against an initiative that wants to find out? Explain this to me.

Because it is my country and a suggestion on EU level would affect it, and we would also sponsor it. We can't sponsor *everything*, which I hope you understand, so why can't you give me *proper Academic studies* why Basic income is good, why is it better then welofare etc. Again, why can't you give me scientific studies - proper ones. 

&gt;. No, you are just being against more research. As simple as that. Why?

Fuck you, I am not against more research, but you apparently are. I am a scientist and I have on several occasions said that it is one thing the EU should invest in. **However**, if you honestly had a slightest clue about *proper* studies, you should actually know that they are very wel written, and one has, for big initiative like this. proper and very serious ""pre-studies"".

**If you had any clue what you are talking about you should know that this is how science works!. Why, if it such a serious and good initivative, can't you behave like scientists? Why can't you do the serious pre-studies?. How can anyone be trusted with research money that can't even remotely behave like a scientists? What stops you from behaving like scientists?**

&gt;If you mentioned Switzerland as an example of a good system that doesn't need a UBI, then the fact that it's being discussed gives UBI even more credibility as simply the next step in societal evolution.

That is the most idiotic statement ever. No, the fact that something is being discussed, doesn't mean that one need it. If so, you admit that European union need torture and death penalty, because sometimes that is being discussed.

Una nicchia di web italiano non ancora menzionata qui è quella che fino a due/tre anni fa si poteva chiamare blogosfera, che mi rendo conto possa sembrare un concetto troppo vago o eterogeneo ma in realtà, ai tempi della sua massima diffusione (l'era della classifica di Blogbabel per chi sa di cosa parlo), consisteva in non più di un migliaio di blog largamente interconnessi e con una cultura molto specifica che trovava il suo punto d'incontro nella BlogFest di Rimini e i Macchianera Blog Awards, una volta eventi molto blasonati con persino un certo grado di copertura mediatica.

Dal momento in cui il blogging in forma lunga è cominciato a sembrare obsoleto, e buona parte delle più famose *blogstar* ha cominciato a usare di più i social media, la cultura dei blog si è dispersa e dissolta nelle comuni chiacchiere di twitter, nel giornalismo casual de Il Post (portale le cui origini sono molto vicine alla blogosfera dei tempi andati), o nelle cricche di friendfeed, un sito simile a twitter popolare stranamente popolare in Italia  e in Turchia.

-mangia prima di arrivare all'evento! mai affrontare il whisky a stomaco vuoto, tanto meno questa occassione, evita cibi che ti rovinano la bocca, io di solito vado di risotto e polenta;

-vestiti leggero: al Marriott il riscaldamento è sempre sul livello foresta tropicale,  e il whisky non aiuta di certo, di solito è disponibile il guardaroba all'ingresso;

-parla con gli espositori! sopratutto quelli delle etichette minori o gli imbottigliatori italiani, è gente che partecipa per farsi conoscere e non per guadagnare sulle degustazioni parlaci chiedi informati e vedrai che un'assaggio gratis non mancherà mai.

It's called rebelling, and it's aimed at an oppressive and unjustice regime.

And there were Serbian Nationalists driving Albanians out of their cultural heartland

If you know just a little bit of history, you would know that Serbs came in Kosovo around the 7th century. Then they started building churches everywhere. Maybe Turks should claim Germany as their heartland too, because you know, they traveled a long distance to get there and they build a lot of mosques there too.

&gt;Organ harvesting captured Serb civilians and soldiers

Why is still no one put on jail for this? This either never happened or it happened so rarely, that you could count them on your fingers, because otherwise there would be more evidence.

This is the most unimportant casualty of the war. Mosques were destroyed too. So what.

Just so you know, there were russian mercenaries on the serbs side.

No, I don't. I have no idea how did you come up with that conclusion. I haven't even begun to imply such a thing.

&gt;How hard is it rebuild some fucking tombstones?

Obviously pretty damn hard, since they can't move around [without getting stoned](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/several-serbs-injured-in-attack-in-kosovo), and that cemetery is obviously a go-to station for nationalistic vandalism.

It's not about the damn tombstones, it's about basic principles and freedoms. The leaders in Pristina claim they're working their way towards the EU, NATO, whatnot and are presenting themselves as a westernized nation worthy of European values... and yet they breathe in an atmosphere where this kind of behavior is acceptable, whitewashed and justified.

I'm failing to comprehend what is it you're trying to state here. Desecrated graveyard? But, but, **the Serbs**! No. There is NO justification for shit like this. You can't justify a wrongdoing with another wrongdoing. Not only that, but you can't point the finger at some old geezers and tell them ""fuck your loved ones and fuck your tombstones, this is payback for what you did to us"".

Serbs have burned their fair share of mosques and have gotten some of their fair share of churches burned, this doesn't make any of this okay. I'm the first to stand up and give the finger to Mladic, Karadzic and any other smug airhead who thinks ethnic cleansing is fun. However, in Vojvodina, for example, no mosques, churches, synagogues were fucked over even during the war, even though many could find a ""justification"" like you did. Anyway, after the wars came to a halt, all of that stopped. Most of those church/mosque burnings were done during the war. The war in Kosovo is long over, there aren't almost any Serbs left, Kosovo has ""EU aspirations"" and yet that didn't stop vandals from destroying tons of churches and monasteries in Kosovo:

There are barely any Serbs left down there, why aren't things subsiding? Why is hatred like this still rampant? I just bought some burek from a kosovar Albanian bakery and I couldn't care less.

No, the natural sciences. I like the hard stuff.

For instance, on education, you would hardly guess that the ECHR had repeatedly ruled on Roma discrimination over the last ten years, in at least three separate countries. In the test case from the Czech Republic, IIRC more than half of all Roma children in that town were put in schools for the mentally retarded, compared to 3% of the general population. The tests weren't even applied equally across all students.

Clearly the truth is in the middle ground - the state has to provide opportunities, and the people have to take those opportunities. But if attitudes towards the Roma were replicated in attitudes towards the poor or ignorant - i.e. children who grew up with parents who were indifferent to education were given aptitude tests, and then put in schools which had no chance of preparing them for the modern world - you would always, inevitably end up with a permanent underclass. It's the state's role to have policies which break the cycle, and I imagine that would involve some element of extra funding, and putting in flexibility, and some element of requiring parents to fulfil their end of the bargain (making sure that children do not spend much time out of school, making sure they go to nursery school etc).",0,1383422804,null,0,1383423994,0,cd59tpu,t3_1pq7m8,t1_cd59tpu,t1_cd53u9h,null,1428886098,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

Holocaust was extermination of people deemed not to belong to society without the people in question having any chance to impact their destiny. The same thing was with Soviet extermination. I just don't understand how murdering Estonian children can be attributed a half decent reason, while murder of Jewish were out of no reason? Both are equal crimes and implicated as much the regimes that made them happen.

The difference is, the Soviets did not industrially murder the entire Estonian population. I see what you are saying, and really, I don't disagree.

I just don't like this thing where people try to equate the Holocaust to Stalin's reign of terror. They are different things.

Most people survived Gulags, the fact that 'most' requires saying for a prison system indicates how awful they were, however when Stalin killed people en masse it was not as clinical or systematic as the holocaust. The idea of there being say, 5 million Tatars in the Soviet Union and that they should all be murdered for just being Tatars was not a concept there, whereas in Nazi Germany it was with the Jews.",0,1383423067,null,0,false,0,cd59wzc,t3_1poedd,t1_cd59wzc,t1_cd53wzd,null,1428886055,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

A quote from FAQ http://basicincome2013.eu/ubi/faq/:

&gt; **We already know basic income is feasible. Why ask for new studies?**
&gt; 
&gt; This initiative is not just about feasibility studies. It is about embedding UBI within the agenda of the EU institutions.
&gt; 
&gt; In many countries, studies have demonstrated that a basic income is possible to finance at the national level ([see the literature on the Basic Income Earth Network’s website](http://basicincome.org/bien/papers.html)). However relevant the idea of UBI is for Europe right now, one has to consider the fact that no European country has implemented it yet. As a consequence, the EU commission can hardly harmonize, or push a proposal that doesn’t exist yet anywhere in the EU.
&gt; 
&gt; Hence the need to consider seriously how a European basic income scheme could work, and we believe that having the EU institutions as a stakeholder of this reflexion can only accelerate its implementation.
&gt; 
&gt; But most of all, this initiative is really about raising awareness about Basic Income at the international level as well as the national and local one. We believe that the challenge of collecting one million signatures will encourage people from every country of the EU to organize themselves for making a great campaign that will finally convince more people about the importance of the idea of Basic Income in these times of harsh crisis for lots of people.

Well, that is comforting. Are you going to talk about conspiracy theories next? 

&gt;I havn't come across any arguments convincing enough to abandon a serious, EU-specific implementation of it.

Well, I have given you several, that there are no academics involved, that there are no pre studies, you don't even have any arguments why it should be done - nothing, but you refuse to listen. 

And, the fact that you can't answer any of my questions - don't think I am not noticing it. 


&gt;In terms of the cost of a study, a handfull of millions (10 economists/researchers @ $80k/year for a few years, say) is trivial both on an absolute scale (EU GDP is 12.9T euro; 10M is 8e-5 % of EU GDP (0.00008%)), and when considered against the potential quality of life increase/benefit to society.


No, it **isn't**. How many projects do we have that are good? You have no arguments, whatsovever, that *your* study is better than thousands of other studies. Don't you know how many thousands of serious scientists, who are truly trying to improve things, that are applying for money every year. Hundred of thousands, in Germany alone for God's sake, and if you take it on an EU wide scale- millions. However, without any science, you are claiming that your project is the best without even having any pre studies. The fact that you think it is just a ""few millions"" means that you have no idea what science costs, or how much research is being done. 


&gt;against the potential quality of life increase/benefit to society.

Unlike new medicine who doesn't improve life? Unlike environmental studies who might help serious environemntal problems. What makes your study better than thousands of others? 

And, unlike them, they have serious studies, pre-studies and real problems to point at. You have nothing of that. Your argument was that ""the Swiss discuss it so it must be good"". 

&gt;I linked you to an entire journal dedicated to UBI.

Non Academic one, given out by themselves, and political  as well. Why don't you link me to serious articles, in serious economical journals? Well, because you seem to have none. 


&gt;The consolation for me is that others will read through this and come to more reasonable conclusions.

I am comforted by that the fact that others might read this and see that you have no arguments whatsoever, and no scientific background or backup.

The graveyard in Mitrovica has been constantly targeted for years and every year it's in more ruins. Every year when these people are allowed a police escort to come down find that there is even more damage done to the tombstones and surrounding areas. This did not happen overnight, but it accumulates for a full year... and when visitors come by, they are met with a sharp blow - which is WORSE because it's obviously not a deed done by a few vandals in a drunken fit of rage, it's done ""casually"" and on a regular basis.

This was the case in Pristina as well until recently, but somebody decided to be smart about it and made repairs to the tombstones, pathways and the chapel, and improved security.

The main issue is that it's very difficult for families, other relatives and friends to come down and tend to those graves themselves. They are intimidated and are justifiably scared to visit. Being scared to visit the grave site of one's family member is not what one would expect in an European country.

You just expressed the idea of ""in a literal sense"" perfectly fine, using 4 words. I understood exactly what you were trying to say.

Good grief. Every language can convey all ideas possible in human thought. Just because words add or lose meanings as time goes on doesn't mean we can't communicate the same ideas.

Per citare Einstein: ""Ogni persona è un genio. Ma, se giudichi un pesce dalla sua capacità di scalare un albero, passerà tutta la sua vita pensando di essere stupido.""

Se il merito lo fai decidere al mercato, allora hai i problemi di chi va in controtendenza, quindi genera disoccupazione.

Se il merito lo fai decidere al popolo, ci saranno sempre minoranze non in grado di entrare in quei parametri.

Poi il merito come lo dai? Come controlli? I controllori non diventano essi stessi controllori dei parametri? Sì, è una bella utopia la meritocrazia. O meglio, quando è applicata in funzione amministrativa/mercato.

Per parlare poi della situazione attuale: in italia chi fa il maestro/professore ha studiato soltanto la sua materia. Pochissimi conoscono scienze dell'educazione e della formazione. Tantopiù che la scuola punta a crearti una base di cultura generale (che non serve a un cazzo e che puoi benissimo farti da solo) invece di crearti un metodo di studio e una forma mentis. Non puntano all'individuo, ma al risultato. Le classi sono da 30. I professori hanno orari ridicoli e spesso lavorano in più scuole per avere uno stipendio serio. La scuola non è vista come un luogo di cultura, ma come un trampolino per il mondo del lavoro che va fatto perché sì. I voti e i test sono una cazzata. Non siamo al medioevo. Con un foglio non sei in grado di capire come è fatta una persona e quello che sa, altrimenti gli psicologi/psichiatri non esistevano e facevamo tutti dei bei test per capire come stiamo messi. I voti invece maturano soltanto un'idea di ""ritardo"" e ""differenza"" tra chi ne prende di alti e bassi; tantopiù che in questo modo si porta a odiare materie in cui si prendono voti bassi, diventando un circolo vizioso. Molto spesso poi ci sono disagi degli alunni o incapacità del professore. Il problema è ""Oddio non sapevi la poesia a memoria!!111!!!!oNe!"" il problema è: perché non hai studiato la poesia? perché non ti interessa? E questo non viene chiarito con un compito in classe o con un 4.

Fa bene l'OP a mandare a fanculo tutto il sistema del cazzo, scavalcandolo e comprandosi il diploma.

Il problema è questo. Soffermarsi sul fatto che l'OP o altri si comprino il diploma è una cazzata. Il tuo giudizio mi sembra quello del tifoso da stadio che fa il CT al bar. Ma magari mi sbaglio; magari hai veramente fatto qualcosa in questo senso e sarebbe carino e interessante sentire cosa.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"American here (amongst other things) and I've lived in Europe for most of my adult life so I know parts of the place pretty well. Several things to point out before I get to destinations:

* You mentioned you've got family in Ireland. Out of curiosity, have you looked into whether or not you're eligible for an Irish passport? If you are, jump on it now. You never know what might come up during your travels - you might love some place enough that you want to stay forever. As a citizen of the EU, you'll be able to do that. It also gives you a backup plan.
* Most of Europe (aside from the UK, Ireland and some of the newer eastern countries) are part of the Schengen Area. This means that all of these countries are basically treated like one for the purposes of tourism immigration. Americans are only allowed to spend 90 days in a 180 day period inside the Schengen Area, so you could very well overstay on your time frame you've described. Again, if you're eligible for an Irish passport, this is no longer an issue.
* Consider a [Eurail](http://www.eurail.com/) pass for travelling around. Note that it's not valid in the UK, and I believe you have to buy it before you leave the US. They can save you a lot of money though. 

Destinations:

**UK**
Where I currently live. London is obviously really cool and most hostels are pretty good but pricey. London is an expensive city but there's no end of things to do. Skip the London Eye - it's an overpriced piece of shit and it takes too long. You can get awesome views for free from Primrose Hill in Regent's Park and One Tree Hill in Greenwich Park. Also don't go to Harrod's. It's a tourist trap. There are a million things on the internet about London, so I'll ignore it for now.

Oxford
Where I actually live (for a few more days). It's a nice city and has some cool things to do, but the main draw is the architecture in the city centre. The Ashmolean is pretty cool, and the Pitt Rivers Museum is definitely good fun. Shopping is pretty average and there's nothing here that you couldn't find in London, except maybe for University of Oxford hoodies. Also, Blenheim Palace is nearby in a village called Woodstock. It's absolutely awesome. Admission is pricey but it's one of the best stately homes in the country.

Salisbury is one of my favourite places in the UK. The cathedral is a masterpiece, and one of the only surviving copies of the Magna Carta is kept inside. Stonehenge is just outside the city and it's okay. Nothing too special, and it's expensive to actually get access to it. Salisbury is also close to Bath, and the Roman ruins there are pretty sweet so that's a good tour to do. 

Up north, York is a pretty cool place. Very fun. In Scotland, Edinburgh is okay, but doesn't deserve its awesome reputation. Skip Glasgow. My favourite place in Scotland is Inverness in the far north. Nice small city with great history and you have to go through the highlands to get there. The areas around Glencoe and Fort William are some of the most stunning in Europe. If you feel like going to Wales, skip south Wales and go to the north. Snowdonia is pretty awesome and places like Bangor and Conwy are quite nice.

Tip: look right before you cross the road

**Spain**

I've only had experience with Madrid and Andalusia, so I'll go into that. Madrid is a pretty decent city. Lots of good museums and the Palacio Real is very nice, but I was slightly underwhelmed as a whole. It's a surprisingly new city. For my money, head out of Madrid and explore the countryside.

Seville is really beautiful and well worth a stay. The Alcázar is, for my money, even more stunning than the Alhambra in Granada (which is basically blasphemy, but there you go). Leave Seville and if you want a slightly slower and more rural-ish look at Andalusia, go to Jerez de la Frontera. It's a lovely little town and well worth the look.

If you're in that part of the country, you might as well drop in on Gibraltar, just to be able to say you have. It's British, and it's a mindfuck being there. Currency is British, the signs are all in English, Winston Churchill Avenue is the main street that cuts across an active airport runway. It's a surreal little place, like a Wee Britain theme park on the coast of Spain. Go to the top of the rock, obviously. You can see Morocco clearly from there. 

**HIDDEN GEM ALERT** - in Andalusia, my absolute favourite place is Ronda. It's a gorgeous, ancient town spanning a gorge. It's a slow, rural town with a beautiful bullring and it's quentissential southern Spain. Stay the hell away from Malaga and places on the Costa del Sol. Granada is a lively and entertaining city, but most of it is quite new and not particularly beautiful.

**Croatia**
The other place I know very well, being part Croatian. Zagreb is a nice city. It reminds me of a smaller version of most other central European capital cities like Budapest or something. But much much smaller. Go to Plitvice Lakes, they're stunning and totally worth it. On the coast, Zadar is a nice place, Split is fun and very lively and beautiful (I'm moving there in a few days' time), and Dubrovnik is one of the most beautiful places in the world for me. Also, when you're in Split, take the ferry out to one of the islands. Brac is quite close and very nice, but Vis is my favourite and one of the most beautiful islands in the Mediterranean.

Super long post, sorry. If I remember later I'll come back and mention something about the Benelux area.

My advice would be keep on ignoring it. It's hard to educate the closed-minded. When I was in school one of my favourite things to say was ""I'm glad we lost the war, you did us a favour bombing our houses. You still live in a shithole""

If you're in school, keep your head up. If you're among adults, and I hesitate to use the word if they hold these attitudes, try and move somewhere else.

Anti-German sentiment is common in the Anglosphere still. It'll make you stronger if you deal with it maturely. Also, it doesn't hurt to remind Canadians that their Royal family is German.

Mother owns a home, maintenance is a joke. In 10 years she lost about 2000~ euro's to maintenance on the house which was painting and a new heater (CV ?).

Insurance is also a joke. She's currently paying 120 euro's a year for full insurance of her home and items.

Property taxes highly depend on area, which is a price i do not know but for our previous house which was located in a highly wanted, currently very expensive area (was more affordable during the Gulden currency), was about 1800 a year.

That said, every person with the right mind would prefer buying over renting if given the chance simply because renting equals throwing money in an endless well and buying is always an investment whether or not you end up losing money on the sale or not fact is you'll always get money back that you wouldn't get back with renting.

Whilst typing this i was talking to a mate who works at a bank (rabobank) of The Netherlands and according to him a 300.000 euro house will give you a mortgage of about 1150 euro's (give or take) due to the tax breaks given by the government. A 200.000 euro house would be roughly 790 euro's a month.",0,1383432860,null,0,false,0,cd5d9cj,t3_1pqtmv,t1_cd5d9cj,t1_cd5945o,null,1428884496,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Rimango però dell'idea che per quanto il sistema abbia palesi limiti, questo non sia sufficiente a giustificare quella che in realtà vedo in generale come una scorciatoia. Tu lo fai sembrare quasi un atto politico di ribellione dell'individuo verso il sistema, per me invece è un malcostume. 

Quanto alla storia del CT da bar, non so se ho fatto molto ma ho un minimo di conoscenza sull'argomento dato che insegno nella scuola superiore, e ne conosco (abbastanza) i tanti difetti ma anche i pregi. Probabilmente ho sbagliato a non dirlo nel commento precedente, ma come ho detto per me è più una questione di principio, di senso etico e di civiltà. 

Non ho la pretesa di avere compiuto alcuna rivoluzione, né nego che il sistema abbia molte lacune. Come dicevo, se OP ha la terza media nel 2013 in Italia qualcosa nel sistema non ha funzionato - e tu fai un elenco di *alcune* delle cose che non vanno. Ma credo di avere almeno provato a fare il mio mestiere nel modo meno spersonalizzante e più costruttivo possibile (con tanti errori, di certo, e con tanti limiti sicuramente, anche legati a una formazione incompleta cui accennavi). Tra mille problemi, io ho ancora la convinzione (l'illusione?) che l'istruzione pubblica in Italia riesca a formare decentemente, con tanti distinguo tra regione e regione, tra istituto e istituto. C'è una buona parte di persone nella scuola (almeno in quella che ho visto io) che si dà da fare con buoni risultati per migliorare le cose, per gestire diversamente la didattica e i rapporti con gli alunni, recuperare i ragazzi che si allontanano dalla scuola. 

Tu hai esperienza in merito?

They are there as representatives of people. They are there to listen, ponder and cast their votes to the best of their knowledge. Being in attendance (either in the big room or in their office) and voting is professional; not being around and/or not voting is not.

Everything else is extra. It's no less less professional to dress in red than it is to dress in black; it's no less less professional to do your thinking eyes closed than open; it's no less less professional to be  woman than to be man. And part of being a human of either gender is that you will get kids. This is a good thing; we need a next generation. 

Having representatives who have kids (young kids, and not just kids that have moved from home) is important, because they are voting for rules in a society where many will also have young kids. Being a representative with young kids means that you have to fit that aspect of your life with being a representative. Sometimes that might mean bringing kids to work. 


To say otherwise is like saying it's unprofessional to have toilets at the parliament, or cafeterias. We need both to function. 

Saying that ""kids should not be allowed at workplace"" is saying that women should stay at home and let men do the thinking. Alternatively it's saying that leaving a 1-month old baby home with a nurse is a solution for both parents working. But this isn't a solution for wide amount of the population, so how can it be so for a representative, who is supposed to be connected with the people who voted them in?

true,embicek,CZEC,Czech Republic,"&gt; In the test case from the Czech Republic, IIRC more than half of all Roma children in that town were put in schools for the mentally retarded, compared to 3% of the general population.

You (ECHR) suggest that the nasty Czech state does everything to keep the poor Roma uneducated.


The opposite is true.


The special schools are for kids who would not be able to cope with standard schooling, for various reasons. Light mental retardation is one (severe cases get handled differently), another is aggressivity, lack of any social skills, inability to talk and so on. These kids are typically neglected by their parents and sometimes exposed to alcohol, sniffing glue or violence (I remember one such case that happened in a *kindergarten*).


These special schools have teachers prepared to handle such children (it is called *special pedagogy* and it is separate subject of study at pedagogic universities), the classes are much smaller (say ten kids instead of typical 30), the curriculum can be modified according to situation, kids are not under pressure. These schools are  absolutely the best imaginable thing for them. They give them real chance to learn something and no to became  mocked outcasts.



These schools are now attacked by various ""activists"" for very perverse reason. Activists have no interest in children well-being, they wish them to fail consistently and on large scale. More kids failing would generate new EU grants, new positions in state bureaucracy and more regulations. Many people will then be able to obtain safe job for life, a dream in current economic situation. ECHR is acting on information given by such people.


If special schools are forced to close down the result will be catastrophe for all. Children with problems will have no chance in the demanding environment of traditional school, unless the education level is lowered down significantly. The kids without problems will be slowed down and will be threatened by those who are very aggressive. The teachers won't be prepared to deal with the new situation (being *special pedagogy* teacher is job for a saint, not everyone can do it). In the worst case scenario the problematic kids will be (unofficially) ignored by desperate schools and authorities and will grow up without any education at all. (This is what often happens in such situation across the western Europe, I hear.)


The Czech (and before Czechoslovak) schooling system was very good. It managed to provide the highest level of literacy to Roma among all European countries. (Claim by a former Czech PM.) Destroy it and everyone will be much worse.

Edit: typos.

Edit2: parents of kids sent to special schools are actually protesting against the plans to close or reduce this type of schools (e..g. [here](http://www.rozhlas.cz/zpravy/politika/_zprava/petice-broji-proti-ruseni-praktickych-skol-podepsalo-ji-18-tisic-rodicu-a-ucitelu--1013725) is info (in Czech) about a protest signed by 18 thousand parents).

Das Theaterstück ""Der Besuch der Alten Dame"" findet in Güllen statt. Am Anfang sitzen vier Männer auf einer Bank und sprechen über die Vergangenheit der Stadt. Die Männer sagen, dass Güllen nicht mehr wichtig ist. Güllen ist sehr **trist**. Die Stadt ist bankrot**t** und die Bürger sind arm. Während sie sprechen, schauen sie die Züge **früher fahren** (Sentence makes no sense, rewrite it in english so I can get back to you?).
 
 Die Stadt **ist** vorbereitet für den Besuch **von** Claire Zachanassian. Der Bürgermeister redet mit Alfred Ill. Ill kennt Claire. Sie waren die besten Freunde. Claire ist eine Milliardärin. Der Bürgermeister wollt**e** Ill mit Claire sprechen. Die Stadt braucht Geld und Claire hat Geld. Dann hält **der** D-Zug in Güllen. Der Zugführer und Claire verlassen den Zug. Der Zugführer ist sehr **b**öse. Claire hat die Notbremse gezogen. **Dann bittet Claire ihren Butler um den Zugführer ein tausend geben**(Again, sense unclear. Redo please?). Er ist nicht mehr böse. Claire kommt ein bisschen früh und die Güllener sind nicht bereit. Die Rede des Bürgermeister ist nicht gut. Der Zug ist sehr laut. Dann spricht Claire mit Ill. Sie sagt, dass Ill fett und grau geworden ist. Claire bringt das Gefolge mit. **Ihr** siebente**r**(or siebter) **Gatte** heißt Moby. Sie behandelt ihn, wie ein Objekt. Wenn Claire spricht seltsam mit dem Polizist und de**m** Pfarrer(Sense unclear, redo?).
 
 Claire hat eine **Beinprothese**. Sie **fährt nicht mit dem** Auto. Claire bewegt sich nur per Sänfte. Roby und Toby tragen Claire in die **p**etersche Scheune. Toby und Roby sind zwei **Gangster** von Manhattan. Die Sänfte ist ein Geschenk von de**m** französisch**en** Präsident**en**. Koby und Loby sind **b**lind und sprechen alles zweimal und **gemeinsam** (not wrong, but maybe an improvement). Claire packt einen Panther und ein**en** Sarg aus(sounds like she kept the panther and the coffin in a suitcase, redo?). Claire und Ill sprechen über die Vergangenheit. Ill hat Mathilde Blumhard geheiratet. Claire hat Ills Ehe nicht gemocht**(does she dislike his wife or the fact that he is married?)**. Ill küsst Claire's Hand. Es ist auch eine Prothese. Die Güllener feiern den Besuch **von** Clair. Der Bürgermeister gibt eine andere Rede. Seine Rede ist ein bisschen falsch und Ill muss de**n** Bürgermeister korrigieren. Claire ist geschmeichelt. Sie sagt, dass sie nicht so nett ist. Moby will sich scheiden lassen. Er findet eine Schauspielerin. Claire will Güllen helfen. Sie gibt 500 Millionen an die Stadt und 500 Millionen verteilt auf jede Familie--unter einer Bedingung. Claire will die Gerechtigkeit**(Justice itself or maybe the office?)** kaufen. **EDIT: She's out for blood. So you might want to try ""Sie möchte sich Gerechtigkeit/Rache erkaufen.** 
 
 **Ihr** Butler ist **der** Oberrichter Hofer. **Als** Claire und Ill jung war**en**, schliefen sie **miteinander** (""zusammen"" might mean they slept in the same bed, with ""miteinander"" there is no doubt they are boning). Claire hatte zwei Kinder und Ill war **kein** gute**r** Vater. Die Kinder sind Koby und Loby. Ihre eigentlichen Namen sind Jakob Hühnlein und Ludwig Sparr. Sie sagte, dass Ill sie mit einem Liter Schnaps bestochen hat. Jakob war nach Kanada ausgewandert und Ludwig nach Australien. Toby und Roby ha**ben** Koby und Loby kastriert und geblendet. Claire wird Geld für Güllen geben, wenn jemand Ill tötet. Ill kann die Situation **nicht** glauben. Der Bürgermeister sagt, dass sie in Europa sind. Er wird die Bedingung **nicht** akzeptieren.
 
EDIT: I just read a summary on Wikipedia about the piece. While your text is mostly correct and has only minor mistakes, you are not really summarizing the plot very well... The gist is: The rich lady was pregnant from Ill. Ill denied fatherhood, so the now grande dame was forced into prostitution. Decades later, she offers all that money for Ills corpse. Everyone starts acting like the promised money is already theirs, yet noone has the guts to murder him. Finally he dies of a stroke because the pressure is too much.

Italian, if spoken at a nice and slow pace is perfectly understandable for most spaniards. I sure know, as I have many Italian customers in summer, and none of them bother to speak a word of Spanish.

Barcelona is the second biggest city in Spain, and there's a good chance that when you go to any shops they'll spot you as a foreigner and speak English to you right away. If that's the case, don't switch to Italian unless the other person's English is very limited and you think you'll communicate easier in Italian.

Trying to speak Spanish will generaly be interpreted as a kind gesture on your side, but at times you'll just be wasting your time and the other person's. This can be counter-productive if shopping or at a restaurant, or any other situation where the other person will be more interested to know what you want (or how to help you) as soon as possible and keep on with his/her job.

Edit: forgot something important: In Barcelona (and the rest of Cataluña region) there's another oficial language aside from Spanish: Catalan. It's somewhat similar to spanish with some french and italian influence. I wouldn't recomend to try to speak it or understand it, just because every single person who can speak Catalan can speak Spanish, and you'll have a hard enough time trying to understand Spanish, so there's no need to add another language to that.

Here's Wikipedia's definition of ethnic cleansing : Ethnic cleansing is a the process or policy of eliminating unwanted ethnic or religious groups by deportation, forcible displacement, mass murder, or by threats of such acts, with the intent of creating a territory inhabited by people of a homogeneous or pure ethnicity, religion, culture, and history. Ethnic cleansing usually involves attempts to remove physical and cultural evidence of the targeted group in the territory through the destruction of homes, social centers, farms, and infrastructure, and by the desecration of monuments, cemeteries, and places of worship.

I have some worries about abuse and people running into problems with things like security clearances or no-fly lists because they by coincidence match patterns that, while nowhere near enough for prosecution, could still get them flagged as a potentially elevated risk, but restrictions on how the data might be used won't help with that and it's not the main issue I have with those programs anyway.

No, it's the surveillance itself. This is entirely unrelated to what I do or what ""they"" might do with the data, it's really just the feeling of being under surveillance. It's difficult to put my finger on why that is, but fact is that the feeling of being under observation alone is enough to affect behaviour. It brings pressure to conform to social norms into the private sphere. For the individual, it's stressful and harms free expression of ones personality, and for society it damages political discourse.

The thing is, the Internet is something new for us as a society (and before some ""digital native"" feels the urge to go all #neuland on me, I've used BBS' and Gopher). Within a very short time, we went from using digital telecommunication as an augmentation of our traditional media to where hardly anything we do does *not* leave a digital trail.

People also tend to underestimate the potential that algorithmic analysis of all this data has. Many of those uses can be positive, like detection of depression through text or audio samples, or changes in sleep, movement and communication patterns, but the same prospect exists for all kinds of other stuff and there will be false positives.

true,redvolunteer,IREL,Marxist-Leninist,"&gt;Therefore, if anything, fascism flourishes when you have a strong state

No, the only reason fascism had a means of gaining power in Germany was because the Weimar Republic was so crippled. We're discussing how the fascists get to power, not what they do when they're in power. In Greece just now, the government isn't even capable of policing areas of Athens, never mind provide proper education, healthcare and welfare. Do you think people would be turning to the fascists if everything was the same as it was in 2004? Weak states give these fuckers room to manoeuvre and the platform they need to worm their way into the communities most hit by poverty.

&gt;Now, if you start killing fascists left and right, all these people will be alienated by your actions and **it will be impossible for them to understand why you would do such a thing.** Which of course creates this image of martyrdom and paints you as the bad guy. 

Really? When did they stop teaching 20th Century history in schools? If there's a guy out there with a big knife who consistently keeps saying that he's going to murder somebody or beat up foreigners, we have him arrested. There's no persecution involved. Likewise, if there's a political minority that keeps saying that it's going to cleanse the country of foreigners and murder leftists, I genuinely don't see how it's persecution to strike first - popularity of it be damned.

&gt;By employing this same tactic (violently dispose of all fascists), are you sure you're not further legitimising their ideology?)

By forcibly taking a kidnapper from his residence and holding him against his will in a cell, are you not legitimising the act of kidnapping?

By punching a man who is beating another man to death, are you not legitimising his act of violence?

Of course not. These are absurd things to say, the action in itself is neither good nor bad, the quality of the action is the important factor. That's what distinguishes arrest from kidnapping, and defence from assault. Likewise, killing a fascist does not legitimise fascists killing migrant workers, leftists, jews or LGBT folk.

Since the same Wikipedia article you used makes no mention of ethnic cleansing of Serbs at this time but only when the Kosovo War actually happened (800,000 Albanians fled during the war; 250,000 Serbs after it had ended), well maybe we shouldn't use it for this particular time?

I looked around the news archives for a bit and it's really not at a point right now where the term is usually applied - namely as the stage that's just below genocide.

If you think that it""s ""so brave"" of me to insist that you should refrain from using the terminology of the butchers when their previous compatriots are mistreatred... So be it.

All my grandparents were ethnically cleansed as we call it today from their homes in what is now Poland. It was an enormously painful experience for them.

You can claim you're not justifying anything, but you are.

The way you refer to these old folks in the pictures as Serbs immediately and start justifying the reasons why they are standing in front of a pile of wrecked marble is nationalistic in nature.

We were starved, we were kicked around and we were dictated to by those in power. You had it no worse than my family did in Croatia and Bosnia, I assure you, even though it's not (and shouldn't be) a contest.

As for the churches, I'm assuming there aren't many left to be burnt. The population of Serbs in Kosovo has dwindled to minuscule percentages. Some think peace has come to Kosovo, but I think it's just the fact that there isn't anybody left for Kosovar nationalists to have conflicts with, other than the few tombstones they have on their disposal to have skirmishes with on occasions.

Whatever you may say, in Vojvodina we have peace &amp; tolerance levels up the wazoo. Serbs, Bosniaks and the Croats have been in war for a long time, so have Albanians, and we've had conflicts with Montenegrins too. And yet, lo and behold, we all live together without any major conflicts. No ethnically motivated attacks as standard, no religious conflicts, no desecration of religious structures or grave sites.

Hell, we even have a state regional TV station that broadcats in over 10 languages, some of which include [Serbian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo0IWHlAATc), [Hungarian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziDDG1acFVs), [Romani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hARpYrcVH3s), [Romanian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvjNWCdEwBk), [Rusynian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uix4P8267U), [Slovakian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olrcGJNTcvE), [Croatian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8mvyCXCqXw), etc. and we're pretty proud of that. Many of your countrymen could learn from this and maybe they could find a way to separate the state/government from the people.

true,arrrg,null,null,"If you are up for it you could take regional trains to your destination and pay very little.

When travelling on a weekend you could buy the [Schönes-Wochenende-Ticket](http://www.bahn.de/regional/view/regionen/freizeit/schoenes_wochenende_ticket.shtml) for €42. It’s for up to five people and valid from 0 am to 3 am the following day in any regional train in Germany (but not any long-distance trains, i.e. ICE, IC and some night trains I think). You can search for those connections by ticking the „Nur Nahverkehr“ box on the [bahn.de web site](http://www.bahn.de/).

As you will quickly see, taking such a connection to your destination will have you spending a long time in trains and switching them a lot. I found one connection on the 21st of December (Saturday) that takes 8 hours, 21 minutes and has you switching trains five times. If you start early you can probably miss connections two or three times, but more often than that and you will spend a night in the middle of nowhere. But it’s doable. When I’m visiting my parents I use a similarly complex connection (well, not quite as bad, only five hours and with four or so train switches). Just make sure you have a smartphone (or something else with an internet connection) handy. That way you can always check for alternate connections should you be about to miss one. Conductors range from very helpful to very clueless, but there won’t necessarily be one on every train you take.

I’m taking the train a lot, especially these complicated connections and more often than not everything works very well. I love taking the train. But sometimes things can go wrong and you have to be prepared for that. Then it’s really no problem.

The weekday equivalent of this ticket is the [Quer-durchs-Land-Ticket](http://www.bahn.de/regional/view/regionen/freizeit/quer-durchs-land.shtml) and it will cost you €50 for two people. However, it’s only valid from 9 am to 3 am the following day, so not quite as ideal if you want to start early.

If you do want to use long distance trains you can use [this search form](http://ps.bahn.de/preissuche/preissuche/psc_angebotssuche.refresh;jsessionid=hTk1S1YLQqNGT6m9p9PpGNmycbkpKWJPvLqHm51kQFQbqQc1fH9l!1757497425?shopId=96225b_x&amp;countrylang=USA_en) to look for cheap-ish connections. But be quick! Only a limited number of cheaper tickets are available, so if you want to book, book now. I had you travelling to Freiburg on the 21st of December and returning a week later and found tickets for €138 (to and from, two people). Most cheaper tickets are already gone so the connection is kind of sucky (pretty late, the last one of the day) but you only have to switch trains once, will always be in an ICE and be there in less than five hours, i.e. you would be about as fast as you would be with a car (and it would be a thousand times more comfortable). But I would recommend reserving a seat (costs extra, can be done while buying the ticket) around Christmas.

The only difference of the cheaper tickets compared to regular tickets is that the cheaper tickets are only valid for a certain connection (at a certain time), while regular tickets are valid for 48 hours and you are not bound to specific trains departing at specific times. In practice that difference is not relevant for you.

Gas for 1040 km (that’s the distance you will be driving to and from Freiburg) will cost between about €113 and €145 (assuming €1.55 per liter and and a gas use between 7 l per 100 km  and 9 l per 100 km). That all depends on the car and how good you are at driving. So maybe €220 for the car.

They should do their job. When there's a parliament session I expect each and every MP to pay attention and not occupy their time with something else. 

&gt;Everything else is extra.

Paying attention is extra now?

&gt;it's no less less professional to be woman than to be man. 

Why are you bringing gender into this?

&gt;And part of being a human of either gender is that you will get kids. This is a good thing; we need a next generation. 

And that means you should be able to bring them to work why? 

&gt;...Sometimes that might mean bringing kids to work. 

Why? 

&gt;To say otherwise is like saying it's unprofessional to have toilets at the parliament, or cafeterias. We need both to function. 

Are you saying that parliament can't function without parents changing their children's diapers during a session?

&gt;Saying that ""kids should not be allowed at workplace"" is saying that women should stay at home and let men do the thinking.

How exactly is it saying that?

&gt;Alternatively it's saying that leaving a 1-month old baby home with a nurse is a solution for both parents working. 

They could also quit their job. The needs of the child are more important than the need of either parent to further their careers. If you cannot do so, if you believe that having a child won't change your life forever and that certain sacrifices will have to be made, then you shouldn't have a child. 

&gt;But this isn't a solution for wide amount of the population, so how can it be so for a representative, who is supposed to be connected with the people who voted them in? 

What percentage of the population brings their infant children to work in order to care for them?

The common practice until recently was for the parents to decide to remove either set of genitals soon after the birth. The problem with that is that you don't know if the child has ""male"" or ""female"" (or something along this spectrum) wired in their brain. When they reach puberty and they feel they are eg boys, but had their penis removed at birth and raised as girls, you can try to imagine how psychologically difficult that must be.

It's just a small trip on the sea, but it's still an experience of Western Europe, and seeing the white cliffs of Dover pop up on the horizon is something. Once you've landed you can then call yourself Caesar or William if you catch my drift :). Then again, some people like taking the Eurostar, so they can say they took the longest undersea train, and it is indeed a staple of modern European engineering.

Anyway, I can speak of Paris perhaps, but I can only really recommend the classics. The Montmartre neighborhood, the ""Latin Quarter"", and the famous monuments. You need to wake up in the morning and get a fresh hot pastry or bread (there are pastry shops in every street practically), to get a feel of the culture (pain au chocolat, croissant, pain aux amandes, chausson aux pommes, and baguette are the classics).

Just one thing, if you don't speak French, before addressing someone on the street for directions, or a vendor, say ""do you speak English?"" first. Basic politeness goes a long way.

Den Gegner zu überschätzen ist genauso gefährlich wie ihn zu unterschätzen. Kryptographen sind ein paranoides Volk, die recht genau im Auge behalten haben, welche Kryptostandards von Sicherheitsbehörden mitangefasst wurden und welche nicht. Von der Richtung aus sind wir also schonmal sicher.

Ich glaube auch nicht, dass irgendwer im großen Stil Verschlüsselung knacken kann. Das geht vielleicht mit großem Aufwand, unter Einsatz von ganzen Rechenzentren, mit ein paar Wochen Zeitaufwand mal für eine einzelne Nachricht. Und wieder: Auch unter dieser Prämisse arbeiten Kryptographen schon länger.

Was ist also nicht sicher? Alles was die Aufgabe der Verschlüsselung an ein fremdes Unternehmen oder ähnliches auslagert. Schönes Beispiel dafür ist Skype. Skype verschlüsselt die Kommunikation zwischen zwei Teilnehmern zwar, die dafür notwendigen Schlüssel sind aber in der Hand des Anbieters, Microsoft. Ich als Anwender weiß nicht, ob Microsoft Geheimdiensten Zugriff auf diese Schlüssel gewährt, muss aber davon ausgehen. Ein Gegenbeispiel (für Textnachrichten) wäre Pidgin mit OTR-Plugin. Die Schlüssel werden von mir persönlich auf meinem Rechner erzeugt und verlassen diesen nicht. Außerdem ist Pidgin Open Source, beinhaltet also mit recht hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit keine Hintertüren. Sofern mein Betriebssystem also sicher ist, ist meine Kommunikation so auch sicher.

...Ich versuch hier gleich schonmal ein paar Punkte aus dem Weg zu räumen, die an der Stelle immer kommen.

&gt;Den Code von Open Source schaut sich eh keiner an, da können trotzdem Hintertüren drin sein!

Sicher, können. Ich glaubs aber nicht. Auch wenn nicht grade alle 2 Wochen jemand den Code auditiert, so besteht doch immer die Möglichkeit. Eine eingeschleuste Hintertür fliegt also IMMER auf, die Frage ist nur ob morgen oder erst in 2 Jahren. Das Geschrei das dann losbrechen würde ist glaube ich für Geheimdienste schlichtweg zu viel Aufmerksamkeit, man agiert lieber unter dem Radar.

&gt;Das ist sowieso alles sinnlos, die Geheimdienste sind übermächtig! Ich brauchs also gar nicht erst versuchen.

Das ist eine Ausrede für Faule. Es gibt genügend Hinweise, dass die Abhörenden auch nur mit Wasser kochen. Sicher, vielleicht irren wir uns alle und die Geheimdienste lachen nur über unsere Bemühungen. Aber mal so gesehen.. wenn wir gar nicht erst verschlüsseln, haben wir verloren. Wenn wir verschlüsseln haben wir eine guten Chance, dass unsere Kommunikation sicher ist. Die Wahl lautet also ""ein bisschen Aufwand treiben und vielleicht gewinnen oder weiter wie bisher und sicher verlieren"".

Could you provide some sources? I have been looking myself for information on the situation of the Serb minority and I cannot find anything that resembles a situation grave enough to call it ethnic cleansing.

[The Helsinki report](http://www.helsinki.org.rs/doc/Serb%20Community%20in%20Kosovo.pdf) focuses on the establishment of viable institutions and government in the Serb minority areas and on creating interaction between the Albanians and Serbs as being the main issues. Here is one of the conclusions of the report, p. 15:

&gt; Organized crime is the main stumbling bloc in the way of normalization
in the North and its integration into Kosovo’s judicial system. The fact
that its “economy” is mostly based on illegal trade and has North Mitrovica
for stronghold became evident during “log revolution” that broke out in summer
2011. Social and political power of local politicians and their partners in
Belgrade – but in Prishtina as well – rests on the hookup with organized crime.
Official Belgrade and Prishtina must work on uprooting these partnerships.

I am rather sure that if ethnic cleansing was taking place then that would be mentioned as the main stumbling bloc. Instead it isn't mentioned at all.

This is what Human Rights Watch has to say about the current situation in Kosovo and Serbia:

&gt; Despite their EU aspirations, Serbia and Kosovo still struggle with serious human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch said. **In Kosovo, prosecutions for war crimes and serious post-war abuse are progressing slowly and the rule of law is hampered by witness protection problems and backlogs in the courts.** Serbia’s domestic war crimes prosecutions have slowed.

&gt; Lack of cooperation between Belgrade and Pristina hampers accountability and has impeded free movement across their shared border. Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptians―an Albanian-speaking minority group―in Kosovo face discrimination in housing, education, and employment, and Roma in Serbia experience discrimination and forced evictions. LGBT people experience discrimination in both Serbia and Kosovo. Media freedom is a concern in both places, including threats to journalists. Serbia’s asylum system lacks adequate capacity or protection against unsafe returns.

I study at the University of Applied Sciences in Mannheim (Hochschule Mannheim). Im studying a bachelor of Power engineering and Renewable energies, basically electrical engineering.    
    
I have three good friends that study with me here (in 3rd and 5th semester) that are from moldova. There are also people from many other countries in the world, eg: Australia, america, russia, ukraine, chechrepublic, africa, indonesia, malaysia, bulgaria, etc..    
The course we took has the first two semesters in ENGLISH, and the semesters after that are in GERMAN.    
    
Additionally to teaching you maths/physics/electrical/c++ , they also have a VERY good german course that is three times a week on the uni campus. The students from the uni that take DSH (german exam for foreigners) have around a 95% success rate of DSH2 or higher.
    
I know this isnt exactly what you're looking for, but if you already have some german knowledge, then learning german with this course within a year shouldnt be too much of a problem :)

This will give you more flexibility in cases you want to leave for any reason, being you don´t like the city, the neighborhood, etc etc. This is mainly informal and cheaper, it is also a good way to get to know people. 

If you don´t know barcelona very well yet, your perception of the city will change a lot depending on the neighborhood where you live in!

if you still want to have your own flat, this is my experience so far:

* owners generally ask for you to stay 1 year and you can extend up to 4 years more (so 5 in total) some owners are more flexible than others in this regard (i.e. letting you go earlier if you ask).

* I´d suggest you get someone that speaks Spanish to help you, or try to find an agency that works with expats, most agencies are hell.

*  You will need to pay around 1 or 2 months as a deposit which will be returned as long as you leave the flat in similar conditions as when you came in. The legal way of doing this is that you give the money to the Agency/Owner and they send them to INCASOL, which keeps it and will mediate in case there are conflicts. Most cases they just keep the money and return it to you when you leave

* Agencies receive a commission of 10% of the annual amount of the rent + tax (21%)

* Always ask for a price reduction, they are expecting you to do it and there is nothing to lose :D

* If you decide to leave the flat there is usually a month notice you need to give. Legal way to do this is through a telegram (called burofax). Some contracts might change this, so it is 2 months

* once you find something you like, you need to sign a paper saying you commit to renting it and you need to make a deposit of around half of the agency commission. If you change your mind afterward you´ll lose that. I´d suggest asking them for a contract prototype so you can read it and ask for minor changes here and there

* each February your rent will be re-indexed according to the inflation rate, some owners do not enforce this, but it is generally there in the contracts I´ve seen

true,Herra_X,null,null,"&gt;The following EU countries have higher CO2 emissions per capita than Poland:
Estonia, Finland, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Denmark. source
(Interestingly, Latvia has the lowest emissions).

I can't talk of other countries, but Finland produces 24% from oil (which included cars), 10% coal and 8% gas. We are planning or building three additional nuclear reactors (currently 18% of energy is atom-powered) and investing in wind power. We are also building heat pumps which cut the heating expences down to fraction as well as changed building standards so that new houses don't bleed heat, cutting the need of oil and coal in heating even further (these cause fair percentage of our energy bill, due to weather).

Finland also has historically had a lot of heavy industry which needs a lot of power. In the beginning we could provide it solely by water, but later coal/wood was also needed. Now that industry is slowly being dismantled and moved to other places (hopefully somewhere with lots of renewables), so we can soon start turning coal off the grid.

&gt; The real agenda of Western countries isn't to limit CO2, it's to limit industrial competition, because per-country limits are made in percentages from previous emissions.

Yes, from level of 1990, when capitalist countries had already started installing filters but communist countries hadn't.  If anything, this leaves you in advantage,  not in disadvantage.

&gt;If they were really after limiting CO2 emissions, the limits would be the same for everyone.

That would favour unduly countries in the North with lot of water power or countries wih a lot of renewables potential and cause problems for countries without. The current rules are what they are to benefit big countries like Poland.

&gt;It's a completely independent issue, the problem is with actual, non-industrial pollution, not CO2. The author deliberately conflates this.

The CO2 pollution values also take into account households, as you can infer from above. Goverment can take steps to lower these emissions as well.",0,1383478650,null,0,false,0,cd5ok0n,t3_1pqxkm,t1_cd5ok0n,t1_cd5abii,null,1428879133,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; No, the only reason fascism had a means of gaining power in Germany was because the Weimar Republic was so crippled. We're discussing how the fascists get to power, not what they do when they're in power. In Greece just now, the government isn't even capable of policing areas of Athens, never mind provide proper education, healthcare and welfare. Do you think people would be turning to the fascists if everything was the same as it was in 2004? Weak states give these fuckers room to manoeuvre and the platform they need to worm their way into the communities most hit by poverty.

Yes, you're right. It was a misunderstanding between our use of the word ""weak"". You meant it in the sense that a state is weak if it does not provide services to the citizens. I thought you meant a state is weak when it can't impose itself on the populace. 

&gt; Really? When did they stop teaching 20th Century history in schools? If there's a guy out there with a big knife who consistently keeps saying that he's going to murder somebody or beat up foreigners, we have him arrested. There's no persecution involved. Likewise, if there's a political minority that keeps saying that it's going to cleanse the country of foreigners and murder leftists, I genuinely don't see how it's persecution to strike first - popularity of it be damned.

Because 1. Most people want the state to do the dirty work 2. Most people think killing them goes too far. 

&gt; By forcibly taking a kidnapper from his residence and holding him against his will in a cell, are you not legitimising the act of kidnapping?

We are, actually, aren't we? It legitimises the state's use of force and makes it normal to think imprisonment as a solution to criminality. But this is a much broader discussion. 

&gt; By punching a man who is beating another man to death, are you not legitimising his act of violence?

No, but it does legitimise violence as a solution to problems in general. 

I don't think it's absurd. Of course, sometimes the benefit greatly outweighs this cost (""punching a man who is beating another man to death"" is an obvious example) but we should not forget this cost exists. 

&gt; Likewise, killing a fascist does not legitimise fascists killing migrant workers, leftists, jews or LGBT folk.

I'm sorry but it does. The more an action X is done in society, the more normal and commonplace it feels. The more normal something feels, the more likely people are to do it. Context matters of course but it does not completely disentangle different instances of the same action to the point that they are thought as completely separate.

For example, I have a housemate who despite being born in Germany, having lived here all his life, holding a German ID and passport, gets asked where he's ""really from"" because he happens to be mixed-race. This isn't just by some 86 year olds stuck in the past but from people of our own age in their 20s. As a contrast to this his father who is originally from Gambia now lives in the UK. Whenever he goes to stay with his dad and meets new people there and he says he's from Germany he says he's never once been asked ""but where are you from really?""

I think the Germans like to see themselves as open and tolerant but when it comes down to national identity I think the principle of jus sanguinis is much more deeply engrained in their national psyche than they'd openly admit. Just because it isn't a law any more doesn't mean that people don't regard Germanness as a matter of bloodlines.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Yes, from level of 1990, when capitalist countries had already started installing filters but communist countries hadn't. If anything, this leaves you in advantage, not in disadvantage.

No, that's Kyoto (required reduction: 6%, actual reduction: 32%), irrelevant since 2008. The new base year for Poland is... 2005. Poland (and other countries) reduced their CO2 output. That's the current problem - EU (or rather, some countries, mainly France, UK and Italy) want to retroactively change the rules and destroy previously (in 2008) agreed emission credits. It's called backloading.  

Why? Because too much industry is moving here (seems like mostly from Italy, but maybe because we constantly hear about Italian workers protesting about production moving to Poland). One example probably closest geographically to you: Volvo (Säffle). At the same time many countries have big unemployment problem.  

(Hilarious thing about Italian firms: they move mainly during summer months, when the majority of Italian workers are vacationing somewhere. Everything is dismantled in great secrecy. [Yet often they still lose some parts of their machinery to occupying protesters](http://translate.google.pl/translate?sl=it&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pl&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fbologna.repubblica.it%2Fcronaca%2F2013%2F08%2F15%2Fnews%2Fazienda_trasferita_in_polonia_durante_le_ferie_gli_operai_sotto_shock_occupano_la_fabbrica-64810236%2F))  

&gt;Now that industry is slowly being dismantled and moved to other places (hopefully somewhere with lots of renewables), so we can soon start turning coal off the grid.

Why it is being dismantled?... What's the point of moving energy-heavy production to China with their horrifically polluting industry + shipping costs across the world. In  optimistic case it's going to be Poland. That's it.  

&gt;That would favour unduly countries in the North with lot of water power or countries wih a lot of renewables potential and cause problems for countries without. The current rules are what they are to benefit big countries like Poland.

Poland is definitely not a big country, but I don't know what's the importance of size. Your point about location is mistaken however - industry should be in place best suited for it both for environment and consumers, there's no point manufacturing bottled water in the desert, so to speak. Individual emissions are minuscule in comparison.  

&gt;The CO2 pollution values also take into account households, as you can infer from above.  

Home coal use is only 10% of total. The pollution from this is not because of coal per se, but because of the way it's burned.",0,1383481266,null,0,1383482687,0,cd5owb6,t3_1pqxkm,t1_cd5owb6,t1_cd5ok0n,null,1428878974,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

* President refused to ratify the law to temporarily regulate rents prices in an attempt to jump-start the economy (passed by the Parliament with 31 Ayes to 1 No, and with the ruling party's 21MPs) abstaining). The President cited Article 26 of the constitution “Every person has the right to enter freely into any contract”, and added that the free market will lower rent prices on its own. Lawyers noted that even if the law was ratified, the Constitutional Court would struck it down. [[P]](http://www.politisnews.eu/cgibin/hweb?-A=249122&amp;-V=articles)

* Law proposal to legalise cremation for those who want to be cremated after their death is still blocked, almost 14 years after it was first submitted (originally intended to apply only to foreign residents – took them 6 years to realise that would be unconstitutional). The vote is stalled by non sequitur arguments by representatives of the Orthodox Church who are invited to the relevant parliamentary committee (“cremation is not incompatible with Christianity but we must preserve our burial tradition because the body is the vessel of God and because it makes the relatives of the deceased find peace of mind”). The current version of the proposal to legalise cremation has a number of provisions to *discourage* the option it will legalise, mandating that the person who wants to be cremated should apply for a permit before their death and while they are “sane in mind” [[P]](http://www.politisnews.eu/cgibin/hweb?-A=249133&amp;-V=articles) (The law itself is not really controversial among the population of this admittedly very religious country. People point out that the Church has financial interests in the burial business, renting away burial plots to the families of the deceased and retaining the right to “evict” the dead in some circumstances)

* Industrialists Federation and the Chamber of Commerce asked for a 20% reduction of the minimum monthly salary (a law that applies only to full-time (8hr/6d) retail workers and care providers – no national minimum hourly wage exists). The current gross monthly salary is set at 870EUR and they say this makes it difficult for them to hire new unskilled workers or even keep all existing ones. At the same time, trade-unions have reported that most employees are paid salaries below the minimum wage and have to work overtime without paid *already*. The Industrialists' proposal wasn't welcomed even by the neoliberal-leaning media [[CM]](http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/10/31/businesses-want-minimum-wage-reduced/)

The tradition in Spain is that kids get their gifts not on Christmas eve, but on January the 6th ([the Magi or Three Kings day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi#Spanish_customs)). NGOs and organizations, along with the city government, coordinate the ""Campanya de reis"" (http://www.capnensensejoguina.com/, http://www.creurojajoventut.org/campanya_reis/index.asp) to deliver toys to kids. The families who need it, have to sign up via the local social services, which ensures that the request is truthful and help to keep a record of all the kids. There are several ways you can volunteer:

- buy **NEW** toys and give them to your local civic center. Starting mid November/first week of December civic centers start accepting toys, though this year (as it was last one), they may begin earlier due to the crisis to collect as many toys as possible.

- on January 5th, at about afternoon, you can show up at your nearest civic center and volunteer to sort the toys. Toys are sorted per family, ages and gender to give them to the most fitting families, e.g. a tabletop game may go to a family with two kids aged 8 and 10, whereas a ""single player"" toy will go to a family with a single child.

- you can volunteer for delivering the toys to the families as well. Once all the toys are sorted, volunteers will deliver them to the families at about midnight. Don't worry if you don't have a car, many people will show up with their cars and they'll need help unloading the toys and giving the toys to the families.

I've been volunteering for over 10 years (buying, sorting and delivering toys), it's a lot of fun, many volunteers even dress in Magi attire and when we knock on the door and the barely awaken kids see us... it's just pure magic. But it's also a way to remind yourself that the ""cool"" Barcelona is merely a facade or a film set, and that a lot of families are struggling (even the ones you wouldn't expect).

- The **storm**, called Christian here, killed a woman who was swept off the coast.



- **4 french hostages kidnapped 3 years ago in Arlit,Niger have been released on tuesday**. President Hollande thanked Niger President Mohamadou Issoufou, who he said had obtained the release of the Areva workers, with the help of the main negociator:  Mohamed Akotey, a former Nigerien minister. They were detained in northern Mali. Both Le Monde and AFP cited sources close to the negotiations that a ransom of over 20 millions euros had been paid but the government repeatedly insisted that no ransom was paid, and no assault took place. Areva also said no ransom had been paid.

(7 other French nationals are held overseas, in Africa and Syria.)

- After the former hostages arrived in France, **far-right leader Marine Le Pen created a big controversy when she suggested that the hostages have been through Homeland-style radicalisation**. She said in an interview that the images had left her feeling “uncomfortable” and that she called on the men to explain their “strange clothing” and long beards. The mother of one of the former captives, Pierre Legrand, said the four men had simply agreed to keep their beards and scarves in a gesture of solidarity with other French hostages still held in the region.
With controversy mounting, Miss Le Pen later said she regretted her “clumsy” remarks, and that she had only meant to criticise their “exploitation” by the French and Niger governments.

- **Two french journalists have been killed in Mali yesterday.**

- **Eco-tax**: Following protests in Brittany last week, the government suspended the ""eco-tax"" on heavy goods vehicles. But the ""red caps"" movement (a symbol from a 17th-century revolt against King Louis XIV’s fiscal policies) continued with a huge protest yesterday (15000 to 30000 people) in Quimper. Mass layoffs have been occurring for months in Brittany at poultry producers, swine abattoirs and electronics facilities. Carhaix Mayor Christian Troadec said Brittany had lost about 8,000 industrial and food production jobs in the past year.


- **Hollande said he wouldn't drop the 75% tax  on salaries over one million euros in the football clubs**. Representatives of the top football clubs have voted to go on strike during the last weekend in November, interrupting the regular Ligue 1 football season. 

This is one of the rare occasions in which Hollande doesn't change his mind after being pressured by a lobby.

- **A baby has been found living in the truck of a car**: the mother brought her car to a garage, the mechanic heard weird noises inside the truck and found a little girl, aged between 15 and 23 months old. She was naked, lying in her own excrements, dehydrated and developmentally delayed. She may have been living inside the car since her birth: the mother reportedly told police she had hidden the birth of the child from her partner. Their 3 other children have been taken into care.

- **A 5 year-old boy who fell from the Pirates of the Carribbean ride in Disneyland** on wednesday was in critical condition but is now out of danger. He stood up before the ride was over and was stuck between a boat and the dock.

* The oligarchist party ""Team Stronach"" (TS) continues to fall appart. The former director of the public broadcasting station ORF, Monika Lindner, who was elected as an MP for that party has officialy left the party and become an independent MP. In the meantime, a foundation for the support of the research of chancer in children has fired Lindner from her chair position because she is suspected of having given contracts to her friends under dubious circumstances. The subdivision of TS in the federal state of Carinthia has lost one of its members because the head of the subdivision was having an affair with his wife. With the loss of one of its MPs, TS  has fallen under the 4 MP threeshold in the carinthian local parliament, causing it to loose most of its party subsidies.
* The Social Democrats and the Peoples Party continue negotiations to form a new government. Rumours claim, that the Minister of Finances, [Maria Fekter]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Fekter) will not be a member of the next government. Fekter is not very popular. She caused irritations when she spread rumors about the ESM just before it was to be announced. When Jean Claude Juncker criticized her for doing so, she shrugged off his cricitism and claimed that he was just angry because he had kidney stones.
* A homeless shelter in Linz has declared that it will not be able to accomodate ""some groups from eastern european countries"" due to their agressive  behaviour. Left activists accused the operator, the catholic church, of beeing racist. In the meantime, that very group continues to use child beggars around the main station.
* The town of Vienna is going to buy 150 new tramways, that will replace the last non-low-floor tramways. There are already 300 low floor tramways called [""ULF""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Low_Floor), but they are not very popular because they are noisy and have a narrow passenger space. The financial controll commision of the town criticized the ULF for having low reliability rates and a series of mysterious fires that seems to be related to a strange engine design. Originally, the town wanted to buy 150 more ULF from Siemens - which has ties to the town-, but Bombardier may have made a threat to fight another ULF-purchase without a tender in court.

* Vienna also has a new pedestrian area in the Mariahilfer Strasse, Austrias most frequented shopping street. Conservatives and car fanatics continue to rally against it. Originally, a part of the bus line 13A was to run through the pedestrian area. For some reason, the bus drivers union found this to be inacceptable. The sidestreets are mostly one way streets, which makes finding a new route difficult. The original plan was to run the bus in both directions through the Neubaugasse. This was opposed by the owners of some shops, as under the new plan, Starbucks and 3 other restaurants would not have been able to have tables on the streets. For some reasons, the town decided to listen to those people and is now going to send the bus through a labyrinth of narrow one way-streets. As this will increase travel times on one of the most overcroded bus routes, passengers are furious.

true,Herra_X,null,null,"&gt;No, that's Kyoto (required reduction: 6%, actual reduction: 32%), irrelevant since 2008. The new base year for Poland is... 2005. 

Would you please cite the source? I believe we're still running from the year 1990. That's also the year used on [this page](http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/brief/eu/) run by the European Commission; *For 2020, the EU has committed to cutting its emissions to 20% below 1990 levels . [...] For 2050, EU leaders have endorsed the objective of reducing Europe's greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% compared to 1990 levels as part of efforts by developed countries as a group to reduce their emissions by a similar degree.* 

&gt;Why it is being dismantled?

Many reasons. The first is that most of our traditional heavy industry is paper-based. And paper consumption is lowering in Europe due to everything being electronic. Finnish forests also don't grow as fast they do on equator, so the raw material is more expensive. It's cheaper to build a factory near equator where the raw material grows faster and the paper needs to be shipped shorter distances. 

&gt;Poland is definitely not a big country, but I don't know what's the importance of size.

Well, by population you're seven times bigger than Finland and four times bigger than Sweden. By  In EU, you're 6th of 28.In my books, that's pretty big. 

But in relation to to the question, it's significant because renewable energy is often tied to land in one form or another. In Finland, we have lot of water energy; Denmark has wind and so does Scotland. I'm not sure what Poland has, but whatever is there must be divided evenly among the population. Unlike oil which can be imported or coal which is in effect ""savings"" from earlier period, renewables can't be stored easily to be transported to another location. So a larger population means that to get to similar renewable-numbers as they do in less population dense areas means using every bag of tricks you have; not just water energy, but also wind, sun, wave etc. And of course, this is much more expensive due to diminishing returns. 

&gt;industry should be in place best suited for it both for environment and consumers, there's no point manufacturing bottled water in the desert, so to speak. Individual emissions are minuscule in comparison.

Sure. But you're making the products with coal. Meanwhile, you could as easily produce the product in, say Norway, with waterpower and then transport them to the continent with electrified rails. With energy intensive products that need a lot of machinery the employment costs aren't as significant. 

&gt;Home coal use is only 10% of total. The pollution from this is not because of coal per se, but because of the way it's burned.

In case like this 10% is HUGE. Particularly as it would be rather easy to drop to zero. And even if it wouldn't show in national scale, it would benefit the local air quality immensely.  In Finland the coal power stations also save the heat and it's transported by pipes to households, so you can use the same coal for both electricity and heat. We also have changed the building standards as stated. Have you? Plus heat pumps for smaller houses.

Freedom House is funded by the American government, but is not strictly part of it. I can understand your criticisms though: 

&gt; Daniel Treisman, a UCLA political scientist, has criticised Freedom House's assessment of Russia. Treisman has pointed out that Freedom House ranks Russia's political rights on the same level as the United Arab Emirates, which, according to Freedom House, is a federation of absolute monarchies with no hint of democracy anywhere in the system. 

&gt; Freedom House also ranks Russia's civil liberties on the same scale as those of Yemen. In Yemen, according to the constitution, Sharia law is the only source of legislation, and allows assaults and killings of women for alleged immoral behaviour. Criticising the president is illegal in Yemen. 

&gt;Treisman contrasts Freedom House's ranking with the Polity IV scale used by academics and in which Russia has a much better score. In the Polity IV scale, Saudi Arabia is a consolidated autocracy (-10), while the United States is a consolidated democracy (+10); Russia has a score of +4, while United Arab Emirates has a score of -8.

true,Herra_X,null,null,"&gt;They could also quit their job.

Welcome to 19th century where it was acceptable to think that having kids and having a work-life are opposites, instead of something that one should be able to mix in a satisfactory manner. Women work till they find a husband, at which point they quit and turn into baby-factories and later into live-in nurses. Perhaps when the kids have flown out of the house they might fiddle a bit with hobbies because whatever education they have had is decades out of date. 

Not to mention this is very upper-class idea; the families of lower classes can't live on the salary of one person alone. So ""think of the children"" is nice enough, ""having food on the table and money to pay the rent"" is even better.

But back to the better off-people. If having babies is a reason to quit, this means a woman could not pursue a career without knowing that it's all over if they get pregnant. Infact, getting pregnant isn't even needed, because companies will not bother grooming women they know will drop everything once they get a bun in the oven. 

""Quitting to have kids"" is one of the main reasons why Japan isn't having enough kids and may well be one of the main reasons why their economy is doing passably at best.

&gt;When there's a parliament session I expect each and every MP to pay attention and not occupy their time with something else.

Again, very few people in the parliament, be it men or women, don't do ""something else"" when listening to speeches. That's why the mic is wired to the offices as well, so you don't have to passively sit listening to speeches when you can do something productive as well.

Anyway, representatives know the most time-effective way to spend their time. 

&gt;Are you saying that parliament can't function without parents changing their children's diapers during a session?

I'm saying that a parliament that doesn't reflect the hopes and values of the society isn't really a parliament that works as intended. And our hopes are that women can be equal to men; that women can work and pursue careers as well as men AND THAT women continue to make babies to replace the population that's leaving working life. If we make it hard to fit these pieces together, we will not last.

If we can make it work, kids will grow up happy and they continue to be happy when they enter working life. We don't want stories where a woman has to sacrifice either kids or work. We must create a society where one can do both.

&gt; if you believe that having a child won't change your life forever and that certain sacrifices will have to be made, then you shouldn't have a child.

""Certain sacrifices"" is one thing and ""losing half the brightest minds in the country"" is something else entirely. And we can't have that only people who hate their works make children. 

And as said, the lower classes have never been in a situation where women could stay at home and raise children. Every hand is needed. 

&gt;What percentage of the population brings their infant children to work in order to care for them?

It's not a question of what percentage of population does so now, but what percentage of population we hope does so in 50 years. ",0,1383487588,null,0,1383487869,0,cd5q0nd,t3_1pomgc,t1_cd5q0nd,t1_cd5n5zm,null,1428878451,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The (post 2013) reality is much more complicated than I thought, I was partially wrong.  
I understand it this way:  
There are two systems: European Emissions Trading System (ETS) and Effort Sharing Decision (ESD). ETS is going to be EU-wide CO2 auctioning system with 2005 as base level. Companies will have to buy from EU.  

ESD is a per-country system for things not covered by ETS (like private emissions). Target emissions are computed in some complicated way, taking both current emissions and gdp into account,  yet some countries get too much, some not enough.  
This is again computed relative to 2005.  

http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/effort/

Now all of these reductions are supposed to create a reduction from EU-wide 1990 level.  

The current general political problem is with national ETS clauses which, in previous (current) system, were given per country, as Phase I of new carbon market. Some countries want to retroactively remove them as they feel CO2 is currently too cheap.  

The (another) Poland-specific issue is that the change is too rapid to accommodate when 90%+ of energy is from coal, at the same time when non-eu countries don't care about CO2.    

&gt;In case like this 10% is HUGE. Particularly as it would be rather easy to drop to zero. 

This is a problem but not because of CO2, because of actual pollution. A coal ban is being planned in Krakow. 

&gt;We also have changed the building standards as stated. Have you? Plus heat pumps for smaller houses.

The problem is with old buildings obviously.  

&gt; In Finland the coal power stations also save the heat and it's transported by pipes to households, so you can use the same coal for both electricity and heat.

Uh... seriously? That's a XIX century idea, used since literally everywhere where it makes sense.

&gt;Meanwhile, you could as easily produce the product in, say Norway, with waterpower and then transport them to the continent with electrified rails. With energy intensive products that need a lot of machinery the employment costs aren't as significant.

* Some idiot walked into LA's airport (LAX) and started firing a semiautomatic weapon. He killed a TSA agent and wounded some other people before being shot and subdued. Turns out he's just some 23-year old crazy guy with a machine gun.

* Turns out the NSA is spying on everyone. Reddit cares, but it's become way less of a mainstream issue.

* Everyone is super pissed that the Healthcare.gov website was crashing and non-responsive for a lot of people when the Affordable Care Act (i.e. Obamacare, if you're a 7-year-old) went into effect the other week. Lots of grandstanding about how it should've been better prepared, even though a few people remember how the Republicans shut down the government and threw a hissy fit a few weeks ago trying to repeal it.

* Everyone is also pissed at Obama because apparently some private health plans, which everyone was told we could keep if we wanted, will no longer be available because they don't meet the minimum requirements set by the federal government for coverage. 

* The NYC mayor's race is getting a lot of press, as is the election for Virginia's next governor, which is seen as a bellweather for national political trends. The Democrat is almost definitely going to win, while the Republican is batshit insane. (Disclaimer: I am from Virginia.)

true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"&gt;Welcome to 19th century where it was acceptable to think that having kids and having a work-life are opposites, instead of something that one should be able to mix in a satisfactory manner. Women work till they find a husband, at which point they quit and turn into baby-factories and later into live-in nurses. Perhaps when the kids have flown out of the house they might fiddle a bit with hobbies because whatever education they have had is decades out of date. 

You're strawmanning me. 

&gt;Not to mention this is very upper-class idea; the families of lower classes can't live on the salary of one person alone. So ""think of the children"" is nice enough, ""having food on the table and money to pay the rent"" is even better.

We're talking about politicians here. Regardless, having a child when you're incapable of supporting it financially is irresponsible.

&gt;But back to the better off-people. If having babies is a reason to quit, this means a woman could not pursue a career without knowing that it's all over if they get pregnant. Infact, getting pregnant isn't even needed, because companies will not bother grooming women they know will drop everything once they get a bun in the oven. 

Firstly, a child has two parents. Secondly, this isn't about having kids in general, it's about bringing them to work in order to care for them. 

&gt;""Quitting to have kids"" is one of the main reasons why Japan isn't having enough kids and may well be one of the main reasons why their economy is doing passably at best.

You're severely misinformed and I'd advise you not to speak on subjects you know nothing about. It makes you look quite silly. 

&gt;Again, very few people in the parliament, be it men or women, don't do ""something else"" when listening to speeches. That's why the mic is wired to the offices as well, so you don't have to passively sit listening to speeches when you can do something productive as well.

Apparently, attending sessions deciding the future of the people you were elected to represent isn't considered productive. 

&gt;I'm saying that a parliament that doesn't reflect the hopes and values of the society isn't really a parliament that works as intended. 

How many companies in Europe find it acceptable to bring your child to work in order to care for it?

&gt;And our hopes are that women can be equal to men; that women can work and pursue careers as well as men...

In what way is a woman's career path jeopardised by not being able to bring her child to work?

&gt;If we make it hard to fit these pieces together, we will not last.

You've just predicted a world ending scenario if women and men can't change their children's diapers at work. Maybe you're being just a little bit irrational? 

&gt;If we can make it work, kids will grow up happy and they continue to be happy when they enter working life. We don't want stories where a woman has to sacrifice either kids or work. We must create a society where one can do both.

I'm not sure if you've ever had to take care of kids, or if you ever worked, but let me make it very clear: you cannot do both. Work and family life do not mix outside of some very specific professions. 

&gt;""Certain sacrifices"" is one thing and ""losing half the brightest minds in the country"" is something else entirely. And we can't have that only people who hate their works make children. 

How exactly will we be losing half the brightest minds in this country by maintaining the status quo?

&gt;And as said, the lower classes have never been in a situation where women could stay at home and raise children. Every hand is needed. 

And your solution to a lower class family's inability to financially care for their child is to force companies to turn their offices into nurseries? 

&gt;It's not a question of what percentage of population does so now, but what percentage of population we hope does so in 50 years.

* University lecturers go on strike over a pay dispute.
* After years of using their ""investigative journalism"" to reveal other people's personal affairs, it is revealed that two prominent journalists at the centre of the phone hacking scandal were having an affair with each other.
* A press regulation royal charter has now been approved. What this means is that there will now be a new independent regulation body, similar to that already in place for television broadcasts, which ensures that the media behave in an ethical manner and responds to complaints made by readers.
* It is revealed that under the free schools systems (which are schools that are funded by the tax-payer but set up by people independent of government), people have been employed as teachers despite having no formal qualifications.
* Russell Brand raises controversy when he thinks that the best way to deal with the monotony of the two party system is to encourage everyone not to vote in the next election.  Robert Webb counters this by rejoining the Labour party.
* Court of Appeal trials are now allowed to be televised.

I'm biased I guess, but Northern Europe is actually very nice during the summer. Long days and short nights. Stockholm, Helsinki and Tallinn are connected with ferries.

The Freedom of the Press index assesses 
the  degree  of  print,  broadcast,  and 
internet  freedom  in  every  country  in  the 
world,  analyzing  the  events  and 
developments  of  each  calendar  year. 
Ratings  are  determined  through  an 
examination of three broad categories: the 
legal  environment  in  which  media 
operate;  political  influences  on  reporting 
and  access  to  information;  and  economic 
pressures  on  content  and  the 
dissemination of news.  
 

* Under  the **legal**  category,  the  index 
assesses  the  laws  and  regulations  that 
could  influence  media  content  as  well  as 
the  extent  to  which  the  government  uses 
these tools to restrict the media’s ability 
to function.  
 

* The **political**  category  encompasses  a 
variety  of  issues,  including  editorial 
pressure  by  the  government  or  other 
actors,  censorship  and  self-censorship, 
the ability of reporters to cover the news, 
and  the  extralegal  intimidation  of  and 
violence against journalists.  
 
* Under  the **economic** category,  the  index 
examines  issues  such  as  the  structure, 
transparency, and concentration of media 
ownership;  costs  of  production  and 
distribution;  and  the  impact  of  adver-tising, subsidies, and bribery on content.  
 
Ratings  reflect  not  just  government 
actions  and policies,  but  the  behavior  of 
the press itself in testing boundaries, even 
in  more  restrictive  environments,  as  well 
as  the  impact  of  nonstate  actors.  Each 
country  receives  a  numerical  rating  from 
0  (the  most  free)  to  100  (the  least  free), 
which  serves  as the  basis  for  a  press-freedom status designation of Free, Partly 
Free, or Not Free.
