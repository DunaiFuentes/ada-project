And romanis ARE different than the minorities you have in the USA, and for worse. It took me seconds to spot a well-dressed, well-groomed black man in a nice car outside JFK and for the years I spent in Bulgaria, I didn't see a single ""gypsy"" that was even willing to try and look decent, find a proper job and so on. 

A few years ago they built a whole new neighbourhood in Plovdiv for the romas as a part of a minotiry integration programme. Within months there were no power lines, livestock literally lived inside the buildings and the whole place generally looked like a dump. 

Another integration programme that they have is to educate romani and get them in the schools. My best friend from Bulgaria's mother is a first grade teacher and she loves her job except for the part where she has to deal with gypsies, because they refuse to let their kids go to school.

So yeah, I guess you could say it's their choice to be less successful.

Bulgarians are touchy on this subject, because since Bulgaria joined the EU, thousands of romani people left the country and fled to Western Europe, where:

* France deported thousands of gypsies back to Romania and Bulgaria a couple years ago because all they did once in France, was beg and steal and avoid having normal lives.

* At a point Norway started refusing to let them into the country, and actually offered money to the ones who were already in, to make them go back to where they came from. NORWAY.

And that's just countries that have taken official measures against it. I'm not even mentioning prostitution in the Netherlands and drug-smuggling in Germany.

Problem with that is, they all have Bulgarian IDs, so ""Bulgarians"" usually make the headlines with something theft-, scam-, drug-, or human traffic-related - and while ethnic Bulgarians for the most part work their asses off to get a decent life in the countries they go to, they see a lot of doors being shut for them because of what the gypsies have done (see the UK, the Netherlands and probably more to come).",0,1380366379,null,0,false,0,ccgygup,t3_1m0k9p,t1_ccgygup,t1_ccgtqnh,null,1429316512,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,MrDigital_,SCOT,Scotland/UK,"I feel that the issue with Gibraltar is quite understandable given that it was explicitly historically Spanish (or at least a major direct predecessor with Castille) and is right there on the Spanish mainland chipped away. Add to that the only reason we have it is that we annexed it militarily, the issue becomes even more contentious. It would seem like the simple solution would be to give it back to Spain, but of course the fact a settled population exists there complicates matters. With all that being said, I think Spain are using the Gibraltar issue for political posturing more than anything else at the moment, as it's useful to distract people from other events going on (primarily Catalonian independence movement).

The Falkland Islands issue on the other hand is so much less credible. From what I know, Argentina do have some sort of claim to the islands, in so much that they had a brief military presence on the uninhabited islands at one point, but equally, so did many other countries. So from that viewpoint, I don't believe there is any argument of substance. Then there is the simple proximity of the islands to Argentina, which I also don't think holds much weight. If the islands were in fact an area bordered all around by mainland Argentina (like Gibraltar) then fair enough, but not a couple of islands *somewhat* close to you. Overall, a small military presence a very long time ago (amongst many others) mixed with a flimsy proximity argument don't lead to a very convincing case, unlike the fairly strong case for Gibraltar.

The thing which is most annoying about the Falkland Islands dispute is that I don't even believe the Argentinian politicians care about it for the reasons they claim to, I believe it is done purely for popularity and political gain. For example, when the Argentine President was making international complaints about the islands, I was very confused. She *must* have known that doing that would only serve to make the UK more steadfast in its resolve, same with the islanders, so why do it if it is so obviously going to lessen your chances of getting the islands? But the answer is simple, it brings popularity from the people when they see their President bravely standing up to the foreign aggressor. In other words, Populism at its simplest level.

The question if they were nationalist or socialist is a bit different as well. All the time since the ideological start of socialism or communism, it came with a call for the international unification of workers or sovjets, depending on how your standing is.

Therre was also the communist internationale, a congregation of communist parties from all nations, who met to discuss on how to spread world communism.
National socialism is on the other end of the spectrum.

A parte che dà per scontato l'esistenza di fonti che gli studiosi hanno solo ipotizzato (la Q e la QS) e che dice, con una certezza che sa solo lui da dove ha preso, che queste fonti (che, ribadisco, sono ipotetiche) hanno preso dai protovangeli, cioè i primi vangeli (tra l'altro ora ho capito da dove veniva il tuo errore).

Dicevo, a parte quello, da lì dice poi che la questione della resurrezione è un'aggiunta posteriore, postulando che è una ""costruzione"", buttando all'aria quando gli fa comodo i metodi della critica ermeneutica di cui si è riempito la bocca poco prima.

Poi parla di San Paolo e anche lì sbaglia dicendo che l'inserimento della resurrezione nei vangeli è opera sua ""il primo a farla arrivare è appunto San Paolo"" (min. 11:55 circa) e che lui non si fida di uno che non lo ha visto e quindi è tutta un'invenzione.

Questo ragionamento fa acqua da diverse parti. Il messaggio cristiano è basato sulla resurrezione di Gesù, ""Vangelo"" = ""buona notizia"" (che Gesù è risorto), e che si è diffuso proprio grazie a questa notizia che si è sparsa di uno che è morto e risorto, e quindi postulare che la dottrina della resurrezione è arrivata in un secondo momento è veramente, ancora, dire cose che stanno solo nella sua testa.

&gt;Si, ma non c'è un testimone oculare di gesù.

Il Vangelo di Giovanni pare contenga materiale scritto in prima persona dall'apostolo: da come è scritto, alcune descrizioni paiono scritte da uno che era lì presente. Due, ammesso e non concesso che la resurrezione sia un'aggiunta successiva (e ripeto, non è così perché l'ultimo capitolo di Marco, pur essendo un'aggiunta, non parla della resurrezione e in più per il motivo che ho detto prima), ciò comunque non porta ad affermare, da un punto di vista strettamente logico, che non sia avvenuta per niente.

Comunque il fatto stesso che la premessa sia sbagliata ne invalida tutto il ragionamento, che tra l'altro non ha una consequenzialità logica né metodologica.

true,khebit,ESPA,Spain,"&gt; I feel that the issue with Gibraltar is quite understandable given that it was explicitly historically Spanish (or at least a major direct predecessor with Castille) and is right there on the Spanish mainland chipped away. Add to that the only reason we have it is that we annexed it militarily, the issue becomes even more contentious. It would seem like the simple solution would be to give it back to Spain, but of course the fact a settled population exists there complicates matters. With all that being said, I think Spain are using the Gibraltar issue for political posturing more than anything else at the moment, as it's useful to distract people from other events going on (primarily Catalonian independence movement).

As a Spanish, and from the South (Andalucia region, which is the one that surrounds Gibraltar) - I don't give a fuck about what the status of Gibraltar is, I just want them to stop doing illegal activities such as boat cleaning and destroying tho fishing areas thus creating problems for Spanish fishers; to stop helping black market of cigarettes* and stop invading Spanish territorial waters/land, which they have been doing for quite a lot of time.

(*) If you take all the packets of cigarettes that arrive to Gibraltar, you'll find out that every person in Gibraltar would smoke 3 packets a day (including children) if there weren't ""other activities"".

*National socialism has little to do with socialism. In fact, socialists were [one of the groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camp_badges) that got the concentration &amp; labor camp treatment.*

*National Socialism was virtually purpose built as a right-wing alternative to socialism, and it tried to defeat class divisions by emphasizing nationalism. The Nazis themselves wouldn't publicly identify as either right- or left-wingers. They're however generally considered a rightist party, because of their emphasis on hierarchy, social conservatism and extreme anti-liberalism.*

*The Nazis also had nothing against private ownership of property, and private enterprise. As long as it didn't conflict with the interests of the state.*

&gt;That is to say, I don't think Moldova entering the EU without Transnistria would actually end any prospect of getting it back. In this case, oddly enough, I think it's more likely to lead to a resolution, since Moldovans in Transnistria are likely to become a lot more vocal about the issue if they know it's all on their shoulders and not the Moldovan government's.

Yes, but they would rather become part of Russia than unite with Moldova. The levels of political and historical ignorance in Moldova are staggering...Transnistria is only worse.

In my eyes the purpose of the prison system is not to punish, it's to rehabilitate. You can't rehabilitate people if they're dead. 

Even if you do want to punish those who have committed grievous atrocities to their fellow people, why give them the easy way out? Why let them just die? If you want to punish them, force them to live out their days in prison and have to succumb to old age and rot like the rest of us. Prove to them that they are not special and that they will die in an unspecial way. Surely you would prefer this method of punishment to a painless and quick execution?

But alas, I really don't see the benefit to anyone of forcing people to suffer or to die. Who really benefits from that? Why not lock them up until you have some certainty that they will not re-offend and then let them back into the world to become a contributor to society. Someone who creates wealth, who has a job who makes other people's lives better.

If the gov can make something,like a park (random silly example), where x number of people manage to find jobs (opening hot dog stands or whatever) , that's a good ROI, and of course there should be more stuff like that done.

Oh God, Spain has already done that. Do you have any idea how many parks were built at the beginning of the crisis, how many roads renovated? The previous government was full of devout Keynesians, and although they were rather clumsy in their execution, Spain currently has world-class physical infrastructures: the freeways are the envy of Germany, the high-speed train network the envy of France, and the country is cluttered with (mostly empty) designer museums and cultural venues by big-name architects, with every city and town following the lead of Bilbao and its Guggenheim. Even if the government still had money to continue this (which it hasn't), there would be little point in this: there just isn't much else to build, and the current infrastructures are idle.

&gt; Spain is not a magical land where things work differently.

Sometimes it is! Really, the devil is in the detail and local idiosyncrasies can turn assumptions on their head. For instance, one would assume that, when the crisis struck, the first people to be fired would be the least productive. However, this wasn't at all what happened: Spanish labour laws heavily protect people with permanent contracts, but most people having entered the job market since the mid-90s were under temporary contracts, internships, etc., where they could be more or less fired at will. Result: the first to be fired were the young, regardless of effort, talent or productivity.

&gt; Please keep in mind that human cost is the biggest when it comes to making goods. People will always tend to go for the lowest cost. By removing a big barrier to enter the market ,more people will get hired and costs will be produced cheaper.

Actually, wages aren't necessarily the biggest cost in most branches, especially in manufacturing, where capital, energy and material costs can easily outstrip wages by far (hence the good health of the German industry).

Above all, you must understand that wages in Spain have already been slashed, that exports are indeed increasing, yet the economy as a whole is still not recovering. I am an expat Spaniard living in Western Europe within a short hop from Spain, and earning a multiple of what I could earn in Spain. I know many other compatriots in similar situations, and I believe it is also the case of u/angry_spaniard.

So, why can't Spaniards in Spain be at least as productive, with significantly lower wages, as in the near abroad? As I said, physical infrastructures are, if anything, better than in any other neighbouring country.

I know people who have started businesses in Spain, both with and without success. Believe me, the one thing that has never been a problem for any of them is hiring good people at very low cost.

I have already been over which party is for what policy. Communism is, whatever it's proponants say, inherently undemocratic. Whether that's Mao's communism, or Lenins, or Stalin etc. You keep moving the goal posts around on this argument. You say that GD are under attack because of undemocratic tendencies, I show you parties who are undemocratic who are left alone in parliament. So you say that GD are under attack because they are breaking the law, so I show other parties are breaking the law. So you say GD are breaking the law in a more serious fashion than the Leftist parties.... I can see that this just isn't going to end with you ever admitting you are wrong. I already predicted it when you couldn't openly admit that Maoism is inherently undemocratic for the sake of this debate.

First of all, it wasn't Spain nor France who broke the treaty of Badajoz. Portugal broke it by opening their ports to the British.

According to Spain the treaty of Vienna doesn't include a direct mandate to give Olivenza back, you can decide by yourself:

&gt;The Powers, recognizing the justice of the claims of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent of Portugal and the Brazils, upon the town of Olivenru, and the other territories ceded to Spain by the Treaty of Badajos of 1801 and viewing the restitution of the same as a measure necessary to insure that perfect and constant harmony between the two kingdoms of the Peninsula, the preservation of which in all parts of Europe, has been the constant object of their arrangements, formally engage to use their utmost endeavours, by amicable means, to procure the retrocession of the said territories, in favour of Portugal. And the Powers declare, as far as depends upon them, that this arrangement shall take place as soon as possible.

It is important to compare it with other articles such as this one:

&gt;The principality of Lucca shall be possessed in full sovereignty by her Majesty the Infant Maria Louisa, and her descendants, in the direct male line. The principality is erected into a duchy, and shall nave a form of government founded upon the principles of that which it received in 1805

And finally Spain claims Gibraltar, but does few about it beside just asking the UK to give it back.

Portugal is historically the oldest ally of the United Kingdom, and with its support succeeded in having the re-incorporation of Olivença decreed in Article 105 of the Final Act, which stated that the Congress ""understood the occupation of Olivença to be illegal and recognized Portugal's rights"". Portugal ratified the Final Act in 1815 but Spain would not sign and this became the most important hold-out against the Congress of Vienna. Deciding in the end that it was better to become part of Europe than stand alone, Spain finally accepted the Treaty on 7 May 1817; however, Olivença and its surroundings were never returned to Portuguese control and this question remains unresolved.[26]""

Spain and France started to invade Portugal, but stopped doing so. In the peace treaty that followed (treaty of Badajoz) it was agreed that Portugal would close its ports to Great Britain and that Olivenza was ceded to Spain, also Spain and France would respect the rest of territories of Portugal. Thus the first one breaking the treaty was Portugal. Edit: as Portugal started to trade again with Britain, France invaded Portugal once again.

Io non mi riferivo alla quantità in assoluto del ferro, ma alla capacità dell'organismo di assorbirla. Di fatto il ferro non si assorbe facilmente se esso è di origine vegetale ed assumerlo via integratori alimentari è dannoso, perchè blocca l'assunzione di zinco e rame. 
Se fai un'intensa attività fisica ed in più sei una donna, come nel mio caso, allora è importantissimo controllare i valori del ferro. Come puoi immaginare, per questo, anche frutta secca, semi oleosi e spezie non mancano nel mio piatto...

Per quanto riguarda gli alimenti integrali,  personalmente li preferisco a quelli raffinati... 

Per quanto riguarda la soia, invece nutro molti dubbi: per esempio, alla mia mamma è stata proibita dal medico. A me personalmente non piace, la mangio occasionalemtente. Il latte è bene per la tiroide, almeno a quanto ne so. Le crucifere, se cotte, non presentano alcun problema per la tiroide ed in più fanno bene alla salute essendo degli anti-ossidanti.

Conosco diversa gente che all'inizio di una dieta vegetariana (nemmeno vegana, semplicemente vegetariana) non aveva nessun problema (anzi si sentiva meglio di prima), dopo qualche anno ha dovuto interromperla su ordine medico per gravi problemi di salute. 
Per questo, non penso che diventerò mai vegetariana o vegana (a meno di ritrovarmi per qualche mese negli USA, allora mi sa che non avrò in quel periodo alternativa). Però, penso che 1. non ho bisogno di carne più di 1-2 volte alla settimana, 2. non voglio mangiare non importa quale m. prodotta dalle grandi catene che considerano solo il  loro profitto, 3. anche i vegetali possono essere pericolosi (nel senso che anche in quel caso le produzioni industriali sono lontane dall'essere sane, per cui cerco di comprare bio più che posso o meglio che può il portafoglio).",0,1380385992,null,0,1380386968,0,cch25cb,t3_1n8lqo,t1_cch25cb,t1_cch014r,null,1429314794,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Also, Gibraltar is to Spain ""a bad neighbour"" while Portugal can't accuse anything to Spain in this regard (Olivenza is currently part of an EU-region or something similar shared by Portugal and Spain, edit: this is not a form of shared sovereignty, it's done just to share some services).

I understand that a lot of socialist revolutions ended up with authoritarian regimes, but your whole point was that left-wing ideology is inherently incompatible with democracy. If your point was that ""left-wing revolutions lead to authoritarian regimes"" I might have been more sympathetic to your point of view. 

Regardless, let's take your full argument and see where that takes us: You claim that ""many socialist revolutions lead to authoritarian regimes"" therefore ""left-wing parties should be banned and its members prosecuted"". You realise how stupid that is, right? 

As an aside, I think that there's a big risk involved with any new way of organising society (or any new thing in general). The ""socialist countries"" you refer to all tried the same plan which goes a long way to explain why they ended up with the same result. However, there have also been a number of anarchist revolutions that didn't end up like that. Even if your data was accurate (which it isn't to the degree you are claiming), then still that wouldn't say much about the inherent qualities of left-wing ideology. 

As an example, consider any major new technology. Imagine if people said things like

I think you misunderstand what is going on. Actually, the party itself is not banned. Some of its prominent members were arrested for forming a criminal gang. That is not to say that there are no political motivations in the persecution, but what is happening is not the same as what you said. 

&gt; The dozens of failed attempts at socialism are my evidence.

But that's not really a fair argument. All of these attempts were done in the same cluster of revolutions. You can't really use them as independent samples. You only really have one sample (the Russian revolution) and then a ton of revolutions that were dependent on it. 

Also, there have been some relatively successful examples, like Chavez's thing, not to mention the whole social democracy thing in Europe. Also, if a country calling itself socialist is enough for you to add them to your dataset, then arguably you should add China too? Are you beginning to see how crazy your supposed evidence gets?

&gt; When you test airplanes the pilot is at risk, which is up to him. You wouldn't load it up with passengers on it's maiden voyage based on pure theory, would you? Which is precisely what Socialism has done, and continues to want to do

Fair enough, but you do realise that the implication of following this line of reasoning is that we should never try to change society ever.

&gt; The trouble is that the adherents of Socialism, like many religions, see the cause as so so important that it can justify almost anything... millions of people starving or being murdered? It's for the greater good! No democracy? It's for the greater good! And on and on it goes. You can see why I am dubious about rolling the dice with another socialist revolution. 

That's a general problem with authority justifying its actions. It is by no means restricted to ""socialist"" regimes of the past century.

Not really. There was, for instance, no inter-dependency between Mao's revolution and the USSR. There was just cooperation after the establishment of two socialist societies. Cuba was also overthrown by Castro largely on his own. Of course there is a sharing and transmission of ideology around the world, but those same ideologies are going to run through any revolution that happens today. 

&gt;Also, there have been some relatively successful examples, like Chavez's thing, not to mention the whole social democracy thing in Europe. Also, if a country calling itself socialist is enough for you to add them to your dataset, then arguably you should add China too? Are you beginning to see how crazy your supposed evidence gets?

Chavez's ""thing"" has made what should be the wealthiest and most prosperous nation in SA one of the least prosperous and backward. Yes, thanks to oil reserves that would make a Saudi royal weep with joy, he managed to greatly improve the standard of living for the population (especially the poorest). But if that country had been capitalist, and managed properly and reasonably fairly by a democratic government, they would be streets ahead now. And let's not forget that we can't look at Chavez's period in government in isolation. That country is buggered now, and going backward. Their currency is going down the toilet, and while we're on the subject of toilets there are huge shortages of toilet roll (as well as other basic staples) thanks to his price fixing. 

A country calling itself socialist is not simply enough for me. If I were to place China on the political spectrum in the 21st century I would go as far as to say that they are fascist. 

&gt;Fair enough, but you do realise that the implication of following this line of reasoning is that we should never try to change society ever.

No, my reasoning means we should not try to *radically* change society, with a grand scheme or plan to make everyone's life better. Because that doesn't work. All change should be gradual and democratic.

Allrighty then, I guess it was a misunderstanding. 

&gt; Not really. There was, for instance, no inter-dependency between Mao's revolution and the USSR. There was just cooperation after the establishment of two socialist societies. Cuba was also overthrown by Castro largely on his own. Of course there is a sharing and transmission of ideology around the world, but those same ideologies are going to run through any revolution that happens today. 

But the idea of a vanguard party taking control of everything has been discredited and no democratic socialist today would want to do it the same way. Things have simply moved on...

&gt; Chavez's ""thing"" has made what should be the wealthiest and most prosperous nation in SA one of the least prosperous and backward. [...]

You're just creating a hypothetical situation now. ""If things were done my way, then obviously everything would be better"". I was just offering an example of a country that went through a fairly socialist route and ended up more democratic than it was before. Which was the point of contention in the first place. 

&gt; A country calling itself socialist is not simply enough for me. If I were to place China on the political spectrum in the 21st century I would go as far as to say that they are fascist. 

Okay, so in that case why count the USSR as socialist then? In their official claims they only said they were trying to implement socialism. 

&gt; No, my reasoning means we should not try to radically change society, with a grand scheme or plan to make everyone's life better. Because that doesn't work. All change should be gradual and democratic. 

I actually agree that it's a huge risk but I don't agree that it should be avoided at all costs. Some things can't change gradually from within, especially if the current institutions are set up in such a way to prevent change. If the current institutions were flexible enough to allow gradual change of society in any direction, then no one would entertain the idea of revolution (except the crazies).

Democracy in Venezuela under Chavez took quite the beating. Suppression of opposition (murders, violence etc.), control and manipulation of courts, suppression of media that disagrees with the revolution, the sacking of public officials who are not socialist etc. The result being the imposition of Chavez's will on quite a large segment of the population who gets no choice, which was justified by - you guessed it, the greater good!. But, granted, they did not go full on dictator. But then they didn't go full on socialist either - just partially. 

What made the USSR socialist? The complete ownership by the state of everything, (supposedly) on behalf the workers. 

I think that society is always gradually changing in one direction or another. I have very little doubt that one day, perhaps in 100 years time, perhaps in 1000 years time, the world will go completely socialist. But this will be because of technology. Not because it is forced by workers. There will, one day, be no need for workers in any capacity.

There are two lists: one for regular citizens and one for uniformed citizens. So, police, firemen, soldiers etc are all put together in one category. 

The voting districts I used were from the centre of Athens, next to the police HQ, where units like the riot police vote. So, even though on one hand you're right that it's not representative of every area, on the other hand, the chance that this sample contains more actual policemen (instead of say traffic police or firemen) is increased because of the location. 

Some other guy (krattr) claimed that he did the same work for another location and the percentage there was 25% (which is still very high, top-voted party and everything). But that sample might be equally biased in a different direction: that guy tried to argue with me for months that policemen vote for leftist parties so I'm not sure if he's above cherry picking his data. Also, even without any malice, his data might be comprised of firemen and traffic police as opposed to actual police. 

So, at the end of the day, we can't really know with certainty how much police in general votes for GD. We do know that the harsher police units vote for GD at 50%. We know that some guy took some other (random?) districts and got that 25% of uniformed people vote for GD. But there's no way to infer anything more generalised.

Also, specifically regarding the iPhone and iPad, if you have the iPhone 5 or the current iPad (and not the iPhone 5c or 5s) you can only get LTE with Telekom and only in some cities (which tend to have 3G anyway, so that advantage of more coverage with LTE is gone).

This causes coalition building and with it a distinct position-opposition polarity, which often culminates in a system in which legislature gets made and passed by the position without the opposition having a chance to amend said bit of legislature or to get it's proposals passed. Look at how the EP works right now. Amendments get passed or are droped, because of what they say and how they would affect legislature and rarely because of the political position of the person/party who tabled it. Besides, parties will always strive to be big.

It is only a game of semantics to claim that when rights are forfeited they were only privileges to begin with; if you criminally violate someone's rights that act is your implied consent to forfeit the rights you once had, and it was your responsibility to know that your act could result in the loss of your rights.

Technically, you could say you are losing the privileges you once had; by going to jail, for example, but in that case it is merely a synonym for losing your rights. In other words, the second definition above would be the one referred to, rather than the first.

&gt; Hotchkiss identified what she called the seven deadly sins of narcissism

&gt; Shamelessness: Shame is the feeling that lurks beneath all unhealthy narcissism, and the inability to process shame in healthy ways.

&gt; Magical thinking: Narcissists see themselves as perfect, using distortion and illusion known as magical thinking. They also use projection to dump shame onto others.

&gt; Arrogance: A narcissist who is feeling deflated may reinflate by diminishing, debasing, or degrading somebody else.

&gt; Envy: A narcissist may secure a sense of superiority in the face of another person's ability by using contempt to minimize the other person.

&gt; Entitlement: Narcissists hold unreasonable expectations of particularly favorable treatment and automatic compliance because they consider themselves special. Failure to comply is considered an attack on their superiority, and the perpetrator is considered an ""awkward"" or ""difficult"" person. Defiance of their will is a narcissistic injury that can trigger narcissistic rage.

&gt; Exploitation: Can take many forms but always involves the exploitation of others without regard for their feelings or interests. Often the other is in a subservient position where resistance would be difficult or even impossible. Sometimes the subservience is not so much real as assumed.

&gt; Bad boundaries: Narcissists do not recognize that they have boundaries and that others are separate and are not extensions of themselves. Others either exist to meet their needs or may as well not exist at all. Those who provide narcissistic supply to the narcissist are treated as if they are part of the narcissist and are expected to live up to those expectations. In the mind of a narcissist there is no boundary between self and other.

I don't care if you like it, that's not even remotely the point. You might not feel mutilated, but the truth is a body part was cut off for no reason. You can't compare it to piercing your ears, because that is very minimal and will go back to normal if you don't put earrings in for a long time. 

Listen, no one is saying you have to hate yourself or your dick. Or that you should call up your parents and tell them you detest them for it. What we are saying is: let's take a look at WHY you (society, not you personally) still find it acceptable to cut off an infant's body part. That's all. 

It's a decent discussion and one that we should definitely have. Why do we do this and is it still okay?

Does Europe have the same ""war on drugs"" as the US?  I don't think it does.  Many of the same drugs are illegal in both places, but my understanding is that Europe doesn't imprison as many people for drug use.  Portugal, for example, has decriminalized possession.

Also, many US states have ""three strikes"" laws, which make long prison sentences mandatory for people who are convicted of three serious crimes, which usually but not always means three felonies.  People who are convicted of stealing three times, for example, will get put in prison for a decade or more after the third time.

In general, you don't lose anything from murder, you lose when charged guilty of murder. There's a distinction I hope you appreciate.

&gt;These include your right to vote..

According to ECHR , this is a human right and can't be taken away due to prison sentence.

&gt;your right to a family life..

They have family rooms for prisoners to meet their kids and private rooms to have sex with their spouses. It's worth understanding that these are things that don't affect just the prisoner, but the people closest to them, who also have rights.

&gt;your right to liberty..

From murder, yes. For lesser forms of killing (such as driving over somebody) you may only be given fines or propationary. The prison sentence itself is not the punishment; it's a form of re-education. 

&gt;your right to privacy

In prison complete privacy can't be given for understandable reasons, but ECHR states that prisoner should have right to SOME privacy. I think I've read something about right to homosexual thrusts with other prisoners without being observed etc.

&gt;right to expression

Prisoners have the right to write to newspapers, send letters etc. Again, somewhat more limited than what free people have, but they do have it.

The only other metro &amp; bus system I've ever had to deal with was in Chicago (and it was awful).  I caught on to the Paris metro in a matter of hours once I was there and trying to find my way around.  It was so easy and so fast.  I just got on my laptop and got on google maps to look up a couple of places I needed to go and found the name of the nearest metro station.  Then I pulled out my map of the metro and looked for the best route.  Never took me more than a minute to figure out.  If you have some sort of smartphone that works while your in Paris (I didn't, I'm from the US) then it will be even easier.  I wouldn't worry about the timing of the trains.  Just get to the station and you won't have to wait long.  There's a train coming through like every 5-7 minutes I think.  You'll be fine, it's super simple.  Especially if you can get a map app and metro map on your phone to have with you on the go.  I don't know if google maps is the same over there, but in the US you can use it to get directions with public transportation.  So that could be super helpful.

Though the threat of physical invasion and attack is much more unlikely now that it was in the past, the paranoia still exists due to Russia's waning global influence. It has massive demographic problems, bad infrastructure, a corrupt and unstable government, lack of personal freedoms, a weak economy overly reliant on natural resources, and an obsession with maintaining a powerful military presence.

And how is guaranteeing the biggest party to be able to control everything better? They just go with the lowest bidder each time, guaranteeing that the influence of the other parties is nothing but symbolic.

&gt; Look at how the EP works right now. Amendments get passed or are droped, because of what they say and how they would affect legislature and rarely because of the political position of the person/party who tabled it.

The EP currently can and does have changing majorities for different legislation. The Commissioners are put there as representatives of their country in the first place, there is no fixed coalition supporting the Commission.

&gt;Besides, parties will always strive to be big.

There's a tradeoff between ideological focus and influence, with size reducing the first and increasing the latter. With a guaranteed presidency for the biggest one, influence would be negligible for small parties, making size the only viable option.

Undue political or religious influence? Why should we stop at ""removing foreskin""? Bad mothers? Bad genes? Is a family history of alcoholism reason enough? 

How about council housing, dole recipients, ASBOs, poor grades, lack of higher education or unskilled parents? At what point should the state remove children from their parents' care and responsibility?

The current guideline is ""what is in the best interest of the child?"". It's a slippery slope if we start considering when and what a parent should be allowed to decide. We don't have to *legislate* in all matters of morals and ethics.

I think we shouldn't allow procedures that are 1) medically unjustifiable and b) either risky or irreversible. But preventing them doesn't require appointing an outside legal guardian - doctors should simply refuse to carry out such procedures.

The nature of parents' motivations, whether religious or otherwise, is irrelevant.

However, the concepts of both medical justifiability and risk often aren't clear. Circumcision itself is the best example of such contentious issue. The American Academy of Pediatrics [says](http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/Newborn-Male-Circumcision.aspx?nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token):

&gt; After a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence, the American Academy of Pediatrics found the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks, but the benefits are not great enough to recommend universal newborn circumcision. The AAP policy statement published Monday, August 27, says the final decision should still be left to parents to make in the context of their religious, ethical and cultural beliefs.

So, according to that view, circumcision may be medically *unnecessary* but it's not *unjustifiable*. The benefits aren't big enough that you would do it solely for medical reasons, but it does have some benefits, so, as far as doctors are concerned, you might do it for other reasons.

true,DocTomoe,BAWU,Baden-Württemberg,"I'm going to harvest so many downvotes for this post...

In parts of Germany, namely in the south, many people consider it a day of great sadness, for that's when our fiscal problems started - and they have not ended yet. (That it also starts a series of public holidays that include the Volkstrauertag (=people's mourning day, remembering the fallen) and the Totensonntag (=sunday of the dead, church holiday remembering the people who died in the last year), and also an usually rather cold, gray and wet fall doesn't help).

The 3rd of October is no coincidental date: In fact, back then it was considered to stage the reunification on the 1st of January 1991 (mostly to not create another public holiday, but also to have a clear cutoff-date. Many of our administrative cycles begin on the 1st of January). It came differently, for petty reasons: The elections for the German Bundestag on the 2^nd of December 1990.

Everyone with two braincells knew a reunification would be forbiddingly expensive - still, Kohl was at the brink of being voted out of office in the 1990 elections. So he forced a reunification in hopes that the 17 million people of the GDR - and the roughly 1,5 million West-Berlin citizens who for the first time were allowed to participate in the elections - would vote for ""the chancellor of the unification"". In fact, they did overwhelmingly, securing the Kohl IV government and another eight years of boneheaded politics that saw and helped to cause [progroms against asylum-seekers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_of_Rostock-Lichtenhagen), massive tax hikes (to pay for streets in the East noone uses), decline in social services (just in time when suddenly, 17 million GDR citizens became 6 million unemployed), and a flooding of the job market of people with questionable credentials who accepted a lot lower wages, thus causing secondary unemployment in the west. 

There were different approaches that could have been choosen, like keeping a second state and slowly, over the course of a few decades, help them rebuild themselves, on their own pace. Or creating a *real* new state like demanded in the Grundgesetz. There was no real need for an annexiation of the GDR.

No, apparently you do not. On average, a male looses feelings and nervends. The fact that you perhaps didn't doesn't change the fact that people do loose nerves and sensitivity, according to science and studies. The fact that something happens to most people doesn't mean that it always happens to every single one. Hell, we can find survivors from incurable disease if you are looking for outliers.  Or, are you saying that those studies, and the doctors are wrong and that you have the truth? Would you then mind explaining, in scientific detail, why the doctors and the studies are wrong?

E qui la tua ignoranza prorompe come le cascate del niagara. La sperimentazione cosmetica è illegale da molti anni, e ora è perfino proibita la commercializzazione di cosmetici testati su animali (cosa che ritengo molto positiva).

Lo so che ritieni che sia inutile, non hai idea di cosa stai parlando (come il 99% dei vegani, per coincidenza), e parli per idee preconcette. Dimostrami che è inutile. Poi continuiamo il discorso e magari considererò le tue parole qualcosa di più di un rant infantile mosso dall'emotività.

Iniziamo il processo educativo partendo dal vocabolario: vivisezione vuol dire sezionare animali vivi. Questo è un sottinsieme (peraltro ormai obsoleto e abbandonato) della sperimentazione animale, la quale per la maggior parte del tempo lavora su organi prelevati da animali uccisi senza dolore.

L'ultima scoperta nata dalla sperimentazione animale con potenziale di salvare milioni di persone è il vaccino per HIV, attualmente in sperimentazione clinica (ovvero sull'uomo) dopo aver passato i trial su animali. 

Ma pensi davvero che noi ricercatori siamo tutti coglioni che non abbiamo altro da fare nella giornata che far male a degli animali in un laboratorio? No, sul serio.. se fossi un sadico torturatore (ma perchè, poi?) andrei per strada, prenderei un gatto e farei tutto su di lui

In Sweden, like the law we have against female mutilation. If the parents choose to mutilate their childs genitals, (or frankly, mutilate their child in any way) they will be prosecuted and go to jail. Also, obviously, loose custody of said child and perhaps siblings, and pay damage to the child. That goes even if they go abroad and do it, and then return. I guess they could permanently move abroad never to return if it is very important for them to permanently damage their child, but I expect most of them would stop.

- In mid 2012 the case was brought in front of the Cologne regional court of appeals. In this case trhe doctor as well was not sentenced. However the judge ruled basically the same as in this new case. Freedom of religion of the parents does not supercede the kids right to an unharmed body. 

- Big shitstorm, mostly by the Jewish press in Israel, partly also in the US as well as from Jewish organizations within Germany (incl. the always fine working Nazi comparisions etc), the Muslim press seemed far more moderate on this issue at least to me. 

- In December of 2012 a law was passed that said circumcision was okay for Jews and Muslims. In parliament it got 434 - 100 votes and 46 abstaining. At the same time some members of parliament proposed a different law demanding a minimum age of 14 years so that the kids could give their consent. However this law was not passed. The vote was 91 - 462, and 31 abstaining. Two days after the votes, the law was brought in front of the upper house of parliament and passed.

(For non francophones, ""pet pourri"" means ""rotten fart"".)

The morale of the story, if there's one, is that foreign sounding names probably ought to be considered carefully from various angles. Or maybe not.. the pet pourri shops out there don't seem to be suffering from their naming.

This is because such a government typically represents the largest amount of people in the country as well as a wider range of political parties and ideologies.

He is super rich, and when you hear him talk he actually sounds like he wants to do something good for Italy.

Berlusconi also gathers every person that is a bit rightist. Because the other main choice is a leftist party who basically want to give citizenship to everyone born in Italy and other stupid shit like that, people on the right go for him.

He has very nice offers. He promises things such as the removal of certain taxes but he never does. Or if he does he just replaces them with other, equal taxes. But people believe him.

Due to Berlusconi I start agreeing with some Ancient Geek phillisophers-people in charge of countries should not be given any private property.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;In Scandinavian political tradition (or at least as far as I am aware, correct me if I am wrong) there is such a thing a 'bloc politics' in which there is a left-leaning bloc of progressive parties and a right-leaning bloc of conservative ones. Either bloc might run on a compromise platform between all parties involved. The bloc with the most votes essentially becomes the governing coalition after the elections. The common platform the rough draft of cabinet policies.


True. I'd just like to add however that we have that in Sweden, but, even with that, we can have minority governments, like we do now for example. 


&gt;In many countries, a centrist coalition of different parties is actually considered an acceptable or even desirable option. This is because such a government typically represents the largest amount of people in the country as well as a wider range of political parties and ideologies.

I can sort of understand that, and the resoning behind, but does it really work in the long run? I mean,from my Swedish perspective I am irritated that our two largest parties , the Social Democrats (left) and Moderaterna (centric) are so close, even though they are on opposite sides. I'd absolutely hate it if they governed together. 

I mean, - everyone needs a decent opposition. We can see that it is harmful when they don't ,in the US for example. And I can certainly see it here in Sweden. A good and decent opposition is needed to make the one ruling sharpen their politics, really make sure that the arguments are sound, but also so that the ruling parties do not become corrupt. One does not become great at anything if one only compete with idiots. Whether it is sports or politics - one need good opponents to become great. If one makes a grand coalition the whole time,I can't see that happening. Doesn't Austria miss that?

true,rensch,NETH,The Netherlands,"I know very little about Austrian politics, but as a Dutchman I can sort of relate to what you are saying. We currently have a coalition of the centre-left social democrats of the Labour Party (PvdA) and the centre-right liberals of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), currently the two largest parties in the Tweede Kamer, the Dutch lower house.

Now these two are natural opponents and got much of their votes from so-called 'strategic voters', people who vote for one of these two major parties even though they prefer one of the smaller ones. They only do this to try to make whichever one of the two major parties they really do not like from winning the elections.

In practice this lead to an inevitable coalition over the centre of two very large parties, something that wasn't the preferred option of many PvdA or VVD supporters. Nobody really likes this coalition, neither left- nor right-leaning citizens. So much for 'strategic' voting. 

Then there is the fact that the two largest parties in the lower house don't have a majority in the Eerste Kamer, the Dutch upper house. They will have to find the support of opposition parties there, who will try to alter policy.

These parties however, are situated across the political spectrum on the left, right and centre. The opposition is to divided to speak with one voice. This leads to all kinds of conflicting political agendas that seem impossible to reconcile with one another. It doesn't make the current coalition any more stable. A debate about the budget this week lasted for two days, without any notable results.

TL;DR Centrist coalitions aren't always the most sane, popular or stable situation, Dutch politics tells us.",0,1380448651,null,0,1380448908,0,cchhpr6,t3_1nd1k2,t1_cchhpr6,t1_cchhjwc,null,1429306356,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

*Society*

* Again this week: Archbishop and President agree that all education in Cyprus must instil the identity of Greek Orthodox Christian to students. Both men have *no clue* as to what the educational reforms were to be but agree that they are a thread to Hellenism and Orthodoxy and the Ministry will cancel them.[[PN]](http://paideia-news.com/index.php?id=109&amp;hid=9506&amp;url=%CE%91%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B9%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%AF%CF%83%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%82-%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%9A%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%B2%CE%AD%CE%B6%CE%BF:-%CE%97-%CE%BA%CF%85%CF%80%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%AC-%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%BD-%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B5%CE%AF-%CE%BD%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%B9-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CE%B3%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B1)

* Archbishop, celebrating 50 years as clergy, stood by his support for ELAM (Cypriot branch of Golden Dawn). Commenting on opposition parties' call for the police to investigate ELAM, the Archbishop stated ""I believe that they [opposition parties] attempt to engage in populism and smear us"", ""when those lads [ELAM] came to visit me, I saw both positive and negative things in them. I told them that I disagree with the negative and that we live in a democratic country and we should also behave so. Other than that, I haven't seen them in two years"" (his actual quote from 3 years ago was ""[Most of ELAM positions are crystal-clear and I can get behind them](http://www.inews.gr/116/pleistes-apopseis-tou-elam-einai-krystallines-kai-me-ekfrazoun-archiepiskopos-kyprou.htm)""). He went on to say that ""The Bible says we should love those undesirables, those illegals, but we will love them in their own countries. That's not racist to say, our people are starving, their own government should take care of them"" [[OC]](http://www.onlycy.com/389270-%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B9%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%AF%CF%83%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%BF%CE%B9-%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%B9-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81) 
(I'm sure the government(s) of Somalia will glad to accept those 8 year olds back, will even offer them military uniforms and a gun for free)

* Archbishop went on TV to say that opposition party AKEL is trying to smear him by using the newspaper Politis.

* Rape case surprisingly gets coverage, as those are usually not seen as rape, but as boys being boys (then again, it's too much coverage as sickening media rush to monetise on it and show no respect for the victim's privacy, while sympathy is shown to the alleged rapists). 13 year old girl was raped by 5 classmates aged 13 to 17. She was blackmailed into having sex with them on multiple occasions because the boys threatened to leak the video of the first time they raped her. Boys maintain that she consented to sex every time, but even if that's factually true, the age of consent is set at 17, a 13 year old person cannot consent. Of the 5 boys, only 4 are charged with any offence, because age of criminal responsibility is set at 14. [[P]](http://www.politisnews.eu/cgibin/hweb?-A=246244&amp;-V=articles)

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Fortunately they seem to be the only major league *far* right party. There was a good comment I saw about Merkel's victor in the German elections. It went something like: The right-wing/right-of-centre politicians didn't win the German election. All that happened was that there was only one (respectable) right-of-centre party to vote for. The left-wing and left-of-centre parties are completely fragmented. The left wing actually got *more ~~votes~~ seats* than the right wing. But we consider it a victory for the right-wing-leaning politicians because they have a unified front.

Getting back on topic, it looks like a similar thing might be happening with the FPÖ, but thankfully they're nowhere near the support Merkel's Christische Demokratische Union has. They have a united front which makes them look bigger.

The difficulties start in school when their unaddressed problems cause them to be unable to perform and they get low marks or drop out. With these bad qualifications the job market for them is already tough, that coupled with reduced ability to perform at the job or being unreliable makes getting and holding a job very very difficult. They might want nothing more than have a normal job, but its their unadressed mental health that holds them back. Imagine having to do physical labour with a broken hand your whole life, thats what its like, you want to do that work but there's something holding you back that you can't help. This bleeds over into their personal life as people don't want to be around them or their instability causes them to lose friends and not be able to hold committed relationships. Here they are, with no qualifications, no job, and no one to hold them, to talk to them, to listen to them. So they turn to the last things in life that bring some joy.

Important figures in a field often stood in correspondence with one another, also across borders. It is true that co-operation of today's scale wasn't heard of, but I think this still makes it rather difficult to talk of a national science. Especially if you consider the fact that all science builds on past knowledge, and *that* knowledge most certainly didn't originate in one place only.

Examples of ""international careers"" are the ones of Leibniz, who learned most of his mathematics in Paris but was German, or the one of Euler, who learned most of his mathematics in Switzerland and taught most of his in St. Petersburg. Both of them are as important to math as they are to physics. An example that isn't from mathematics might be Alexander von Humboldt, who was deeply connected to France and was a general cosmopolitan.

It gets better in the 19th century, arguably the one where Britain made a decent amount of its own progress. Faraday was a member of the Swedish and French Academy of Sciences. And if you look at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist) page and count the ones who were born in the 19th century, you see a lot of British scientists - but also many Germans, and sprinkles of Scandianvia, as well as Russia. And that's on an English page, and only the household names in physics.

Is this different in other natural sciences? Engineering might be something different since it has more direct effects on national interest. What I do not know if the average scientist of the 19th century stood in correspondence with his peers. Yet most great scientists are average most of the time, so it's safe to assume the average ones where connected as well - except if co-operation was one of the many factors that made the great ones great in the first place.",0,1380455351,null,0,false,0,cchie2n,t3_1ncz05,t1_cchie2n,t1_cchi9o6,null,1429306040,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,angry_spaniard,ESPR,Delenda est euro,"&gt; I cant imagine spain not having a universal form of social welfare, granted i might be wrong, but its doubtful.

Why? 

Spain has some social welfare. But, it's not exactly universal and doesn't cover all the things the more advanced EU countries have.

Spain collects 37% of GDP with taxes(against 40% of Germany or 50% of France) with a smaller GDP per capita and wastes a big part of that money.

All the unemployment benefits expire in two years and get smaller after the first 6 months. After that you can qualify for between 6 months and two years of 428 euros if the average income of your family is under minimum wage(€753). The benefit can bee permanent for people over 55 that has worked more than 15 years.

[At this point 40% the unemployed don't get any social benefit.](http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2013/04/02/actualidad/1364929407_967760.html) 

There were 5,04 millions of registered jobless in February, a total of 2.9 millions had right to benefits, and a record of  de 2.137.390 didn't get any benefit.

&gt; For instance, in say, germany or france, the social services make you eligible to have your own livingspace, aka flat, the utilities, computer/TV, phone/internet etc.

Who provides that with what money? Does the government provide that or gives them money for getting those things.

We have too many people that can't provide for themselves and the government says that doesn't have the resources to help them. It's actively pushing them to live with relatives. It's very common see full families living in the grandparents house.

It's amazing that you can stay so clueless about how bad is the situation in Spain and how small is the Spanish welfare.

We have discussions even about keeping the school kitchen open to feed the students of families without resources. [It was done](http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/08/23/inenglish/1377258753_657101.html), at least.

That does not mean he is saying that this is because of some romantic genius inherent to Britain, but rather because of specific methods of funding and organization, and specific ideas and attitudes. For instance, the section about Tyndall is trying to make the point that science should be persued for curiosity, and we shouldn't pre-judge utility.

I guess the two main advantages are rather low cost of living and close proximity to a lot of different cities as well as the Netherlands. The former should also be the case with Leipzig and Bochum, though I would assume out of those three Leipzig most likely has the more interesting nightlife, while Bochum is in the same area as Duisburg &amp; Essen so they share the proximity to more intersting cities like Cologne and Düsseldorf. 

Munich might be the nicest city of the bunch and I think the university also has a fairly good reputation... but it's also one of the most expensive places to live in Germany - so it might depend on how much money you have availabe. 

Hamburg and Berlin are both famous for their nightlife so you will always have somthing to do, can't say anything about the universities though and both are not exactly university towns.

The last part of 428€ being cut off after a certain amount of time, is what surprises me indeed.

&gt;Who provides that with what money? Does the government provide that or gives them money for getting those things.

Afaik its the communal government that pays said bills. Its a nation wide law, but its the commune or city that eventually foots the bill.

From my knowledge on the matter, people on the lowest echelon of social welfare in germany will get some 430€ for food, clothes, utilities, movies etc etc. On top of that living space is being ""reimbursed"" up to a certain m^2 amount and a certain € amount. Depending on household size etc.

But I am not very well versed on the matter, since i never came into contact with it. But yeah, in general, at least in germany and france NO CITIZEN does ever HAVE to be homeless, hungry or cold.

But ofc, I'm talking from pretty much the highest standard. 

Hmm, well, cheers for educating me on the spanish welfare system, it still seems better than the one in california, but hmm, time to raise some taxes and or fight corruption/inefficiency, huh? :P

...Not that Fra, Ger or the US are *that* much less wasteful...

EDIT

P.S.: You guys have my sympathies, and when you sometimes see people in germany rally against spending money to ""help"" the european south, they dont mean social programs. 

From my personal bias, and what friends living in Germany tell me, its the ludicrous amount of waste and corrupt officials/""business people"" that siphons off insane amounts of ""rescue funds"", that infuriates the Germans, the Dutch, Fins, etc.

No.

Most people will probably treat Roma folk fairly normally if they weren't part of this atrocious culture. They cause fights, they steal, they litter and vandalise things, and disrespect people even when someone is trying to help, and when the police might be getting close they move on. Non of this has anything to do with their genetics. What it has to do with is the that these people were brought up to think that doing this is ok. They are brought up thinking that society will not accept them because they've always been aggressive towards society and society has always been aggressive back. Then they reproduce with other people in the Roma community and the cycle starts all over again. It's cultural, not genetic.

**Il punto e': non tutti i vegetariani e vegan concordano con chi va a liberare le cavie da laboratorio**. Non siamo un esercito. 

**Ho solo espresso una mia opinione, sulla base di una conoscenza che mi rendo conto essere parziale.** Anche per questo non andrei mai a liberare le cavie da laboratorio o cose simili, perche' non ho un'idea completa della situazione.

La questione della sperimentazione animale, fra quelle legate al vegetarianesimo, e' sempre stata quella che mi ha interessato meno, perche' difficilmente posso fare qualcosa in prima persona.

Quel poco che so l'ho letto su [Liberazione Animale di Peter Singer](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberazione_animale), un vecchio libro che molti leggono prima o appena dopo essere diventati vegetariani. E' del 1975, quindi mi rendo conto che possa essere obsoleto.

Sicuramente [LuluWilson](/user/LuluWilson) e' piu' informata di me, se vuole intervenire.

&gt; L'ultima scoperta nata dalla sperimentazione animale con potenziale di salvare milioni di persone è il vaccino per HIV, attualmente in sperimentazione clinica (ovvero sull'uomo) dopo aver passato i trial su animali.

**E' ovvio che se parliamo di ricerca per la cura dell'HIV e del cancro, non mi sento di dire niente.**

Spero che si trovino metodi alternativi, nel prossimo futuro, ma se per ora l'unica e' impiantare tumori nei cani e far venire l'AIDS ai topi, e' una merda, ma posso capire perche' si faccia ed e' anche nel mio interesse.

&gt; vivisezione vuol dire sezionare animali vivi. Questo è un sottinsieme (peraltro ormai obsoleto e abbandonato) della sperimentazione animale, la quale per la maggior parte del tempo lavora su organi prelevati da animali uccisi senza dolore.

Io questo lo sento adesso per la prima volta. Da quel che sapevo, ogni anno vengono ammazzati milioni di bestie, per la vivisezione.

Ma se mi fai vedere una fonte ti credo.

Io evito di linkarti i vari siti anti vivisezione, tanto so che e' inutile.

&gt; La sperimentazione cosmetica è illegale da molti anni, e ora è perfino proibita la commercializzazione di cosmetici testati su animali (cosa che ritengo molto positiva).

Io sapevo che [e' illegale da pochi mesi, in Italia](http://ansa.it/europa/notizie/rubriche/voceeurodeputati/2013/03/11/Zanoni-Alde-giorno-storico-lotta-sperimentazione-animale_8381297.html).

E' un bel passo avanti. Ma che una cosa illegale vada automaticamente a sparire, ci credo poco.

Tra parentesi, e' illegale solo per i 20 anni di proteste degli animalisti vegetariani vegan seitanisti spaccacoglioni come me. Non per grazia divina.

&gt; Dimostrami che è inutile. Poi continuiamo il discorso e magari considererò le tue parole qualcosa di più di un rant infantile mosso dall'emotività.

Come ti dicevo, non sono granche' informato. Ho un'opinione basata piu' che altro sullo stomaco, in questo caso, e quindi parziale.

Da quel che avevo letto, la principale tesi contro la sperimentazione animale e' che un risultato ottenuto su un topo, un cane, un maiale, una scimmia, non e' per niente detto che sia valido sull'uomo. Mi sembra ragionevole.

Un altro e' che si usano gli animali per test di tutti i tipi, tossicologici come psicologici. Ho letto di scimmie a cui venivano strappati i cuccioli appena nati, mettendo poi la madre in una stanza vuota e bianca ed il figlio in un'altra stanza vuota e bianca, con un simulacro di scimmia-madre, per capire quanto entrambi soffrono il distacco. A volte il simulacro scimmia-madre si riscaldava, per ""coccolare"" il piccolo, a volte gli mollava legnate. Per vedere come reagisce il cucciolo. Anche questa e' sperimentazione animale. Cosi' just 4 fun.

Per ultimo, c'e' l'obbligo di testare qualsiasi nuova sostanza chimica sugli animali. Per un farmaco, per un integratore alimentare, per un cosmetico (fino a ieri). Se la sperimentazione animale non fosse cosi' normale e tollerata, si potrebbe pensare di riutilizzare sostanze chimiche gia' testate, invece di andare a tentativi. Ma anche qui, non so quanto sia fattibile. Non sono un chimico e non ne capisco un cazzo.

Comunque, la mia ignoranza arriva fino a qui. Googlando un attimo [trovo questo](http://www.stopvivisection.eu/it/vivisezione_domanderisposte):

Statistiche:
&gt; * Nel mondo si stima che ogni anno vengano immolati circa 500 milioni di animali nei laboratori di sperimentazione, ma è molto difficile avere dati precisi come è pure difficile avere filmati o immagini, perché tutto avviene in un alone di segretezza, al chiuso dei laboratori dove è ben difficile avere accesso.

&gt; * Circa 60% degli animali vengono usati per la farmacologia, una parte più bassa per la ricerca medica (studio delle malattie), un’altra per i test sui cosmetici, una parte per i test di psicologia e poi i test bellici e didattici. Gli esperimenti di tossicità sono trasversali a tutte queste categorie (vengono effettuati in ognuna di esse) e rappresentano il 75% circa di tutti gli esperimenti su animali. Il 60% degli esperimenti viene fatto in laboratori privati, il 33% nelle scuole di medicina e università, il resto in laboratori pubblici e dipartimenti governativi.

&gt; * Gli animali vengono devocalizzati, avvelenati, ustionati, accecati, affamati, mutilati, congelati, decerebrati, sottoposti a scariche elettriche, infettati, anche con virus che non colpiscono gli animali. Il 70% senza anestesia e il 30% con anestesia soltanto parziale.

Ma ammetto che non ti so dire quanto sia vero ed attendibile. Cosi' a sentimento, mi sembra comunque una cosa sbagliata.

&gt; Ma pensi davvero che noi ricercatori siamo tutti coglioni che non abbiamo altro da fare nella giornata che far male a degli animali in un laboratorio?

No, a parte che non li ritengo dei torturatori sadici ma soltanto gente che fa quel lavoro ed ha una sensibilita' diversa dalla mia.

Pero' le sperimentazioni sugli animali sono fondamentali per i curriculum accademico. D'altra parte se la prassi e' questa e tu vuoi fare quel lavoro, non credo ti metta a fare l'eroe.

&gt; Lo so che ritieni che sia inutile, non hai idea di cosa stai parlando (come il 99% dei vegani, per coincidenza)

&gt; Un consiglio, non solo per quest'argomento, ma in generale per la vita. Prima di parlare, accertati di avere delle fonti CERTE (No, youtube non lo è) altrimenti ci fai solo la figura del bimbominkia. :)

The neoliberal parties BZÖ and Neos will likely not get over the 4% requirred to get into the parliament, Communists and Pirates will stay around 1%. 

The big question is, if ÖVP and SPÖ will have enough seats in the parliament to form a coalition. If not, there will be a coalition of 3 parties. This could either be SPÖ-ÖVP-Greens, or something terrible between the Conservatives, the Greens or the right extremists and Stronach. There have been people hopping for the SPÖ an ÖVP to miss the majority together, but those people may not mind, that the alternatives are a opposition, that only consists of neoliberals and right-extremists or a coalition, that consists of neoliberals and right-extremists.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  there is such a thing a 'bloc politics' in which there is a left-leaning bloc of progressive parties and a right-leaning bloc of conservative ones.

That's how it used to be in Germany as well, but as the political landscape changed it became more difficult.

Up until the early 1980's, we used to have three parties in the Bundestag -- CDU/CSU, SPD and FDP. Traditionally, the stronger of the two large ones formed a coalition with the FDP. The one exception was the grand coalition during the late 1960's, which was such a large majority that the FDP as the only opposition party in parliament couldn't be effective. This, in turn, lead to the ""extra-parliamentary opposition"" on the streets, from which the Greens eventually developed.  
From the 1980's onward, they became the fourth party in parliament, and such a bloc system of a progressive Red-Green vs. a conservative Black-Yellow block developed. But when the PDS (later ""The Left"") turned into the fifth regular parliament faction, the math just didn't work anymore, and we've seen another grand coalition as the only mathematically viable realistic coalition since (Merkel's first term).

We'll probably end up with another grand coalition this time, but there's also talk of a Black-Green option, which would be a first. In four or eight years, Red-Red-Green might become realistic as well.

tl;dr: Political culture and tradition are one thing, but in the end viable coalitions depend on the number of parties. Sometimes preferred coalitions just aren't mathematically possible, depending on the ever changing political landscape.

Plus sérieusement, les Américains ont un droit du travail assez pourri, mais ce n'est pas à cause du travail dominical. Le gros problème serait surtout l'absence de congés payés obligatoires.

L'écrasante majorité des Américains ne travaille ni le samedi ni le dimanche. Si ces jours sont les plus fastes pour le commerce et la restauration, c'est justement parce que la population générale ne travaille pas le week-end. Et ceux qui bossent le week-end le font soit par choix (si, si, il y en a), soit pace qu'il y a un truc qui s'appelle les factures et qu'il faut bien les payer.

Dans 99% des cas, quand on ne veut pas travailler le dimanche on prend un emploi qui ne nécessite pas de travailler le dimanche. Il y a évidemment ceux qui n'ont pas le choix, mais quelque part ils sont bien contents d'avoir un emploi, et ils attendent qu'une opportunité se présente ailleurs. C'est surtout la restauration et le commerce de détail qui ouvrent le dimanche, et quand on travaille dans ces secteurs, c'est chiant de toutes façons, que ce soit le dimanche ou le jeudi. Mais c'est un salaire.

Lorsque j'étais étudiant, je travaillais les vendredis soirs, les samedis, les dimanches. Une semaine sur deux je faisais les nuits le week-end. Ça me permettait d'aller en cours la semaine et je gagnais quatre fois plus que si j'avais un McJob, parce que le travail de nuit et de week-end, ça me permettait d'accumuler de belles primes. Si ça avait été interdit, j'aurais dû retourner des steaks hachés et j'aurais quand même travaillé le week-end.

Interdire le travail dominical aux autres par qu'on ne veut pas bouleverser sa vie de famille, c'est aussi l'interdire à ceux que ça ne dérange pas, qui le souhaiteraient, ou tout simplement qui préfèrereaient travailler le dimanche plutôt que de scruter les annonces du pôle emploi.",0,1380466296,null,0,false,0,cchk844,t3_1nde5h,t1_cchk844,t1_cchjf9k,null,1429305184,8,false,france,t5_2qhjz,8

1. You can't get charged for rape in Sweden for not using a condom. If you refer to Assange, he hasn't been charged for anything – he is wanted for questioning (and not because he didn't use a condom, one of the allegations are that he ripped a condom).

2. Confusing culture with discrimination? Wow... that's one sad way to look at it. There can be discrimination within culture as well as there can be institutionalized discrimination. 

3. I am well aware of the Slovene culture by now, not only the incredible upsides (after all, I'm in the country and I love it here) but also the downsides. And I'm pleased that my GIRLFRIEND (I'm a guy, even though I stand up for women) has shown me both the bad and good sides.

4. I'm not a feminist. I have already gotten my fair share of beatings from feminists who don't agree with my critique toward them. But I am a firm believer in equality, in the right's for everyone no matter what gender or sexual orientation you have – and no matter WHERE YOU LIVE.

The obvious example is one party gets 50.1% of the vote but only 60% of the population voted, meaning less than 50% of the population voted for them and thus you have a minority. However there's also another reason many governments don't get the consent of the majority. Many countries use a system of MPs who reside over a constituency for their parliaments. This means that each MP only needs to get 50.1% in each constituency. A win of 50.1% or 99% are still just a ""win"". So if one party wins 10 constituencies with 50.1 and the opposition wings 8 constituencies with a majority of 99% in each, the opposition won in terms of the most votes but the other party got more MPs and thus forms a government. This has happened three times in US history with their president and every single UK government since C1950 to 2010 has been a minority government in terms of overall votes cast.

* Put an age restriction on attendance to religious services and enforce them the same way other restrictions on the purchase of goods/services is restricted.
* Consider a strict religious upbringing to be child abuse and enforce it the same way other laws against child abuse are enforced.
* Set a proper secular curriculum for public and private schools. Private schools should probably be allowed to add to the curriculum but not remove or replace things. Enforce it the same way current curriculum and educational standards are enforced.

Hai di nuovo la mia stima e le mie scuse per averti giudicato incapace di tale conclusione.

&gt; Da quel che avevo letto, la principale tesi contro la sperimentazione animale e' che un risultato ottenuto su un topo, un cane, un maiale, una scimmia, non e' per niente detto che sia valido sull'uomo. Mi sembra ragionevole.

Topi, maiali, scimmie ed umani sono MOLTO più simili di quanto si creda. Che tu ci creda o no, abbiamo geneticamente TANTISSIMO in comune con [i moscerini della frutta](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Drosophila_repleta_lateral.jpg) e con i [pesci zebra](http://www.focusonnature.be/files/images/zebra.preview.jpg)..  Ti faccio un paragone: se tu smonti e riparli una fiat, e scopri che se l'auto s'ingolfa in un certo modo è il carburatore, e un giorno hai una ferrari che si ingolfa allo stesso modo, è ragionevole iniziare le tue indagini dal carburatore. Magari non è esatto (la scienza sull'animale non è esatta), ma è il miglior indizio che tu possa avere, senza smontare ferrari tutto il giorno.

Ok, debunking time, ma lo faccio solo perchè credo che, se ti mostro che queste sono stronzate, tu sia abbastanza intelligente da capire la disinformazione e le bugie messe in giro dagli animalisti.


&gt; Nel mondo si stima che ogni anno vengano immolati circa 500 milioni di animali nei laboratori di sperimentazione, ma è molto difficile avere dati precisi come è pure difficile avere filmati o immagini, perché tutto avviene in un alone di segretezza, al chiuso dei laboratori dove è ben difficile avere accesso.

[Falso.](http://www.buav.org/_lib/userfiles/files/Science_Reports/Estimates_For_Worldwide_Laboratory.pdf) I numeri sono molto più bassi.

&gt; Circa 60% degli animali vengono usati per la farmacologia, una parte più bassa per la ricerca medica (studio delle malattie), un’altra per i test sui cosmetici, una parte per i test di psicologia e poi i test bellici e didattici. 

[Falso.](http://www.angelconsulting.it/default.asp?content=1,153,0,0,0,Legislazione+sanitaria+-+Direttiva+76/768/EEC;+L.713/86,00.html&amp;gclid=CJqeruP48LkCFYSV3godgGAAVQ) I test sui cosmetici non si fanno più da tantissimo. Non conosco nessuno nel mio settore che abbia fatto mai test bellici di sorta, ma [sul sito dell'Istituto Zooprofilatto Sperimentale c'è un rapporto](http://www.izs.it/bollettino_segn_legislative/bollettini_2011/marzo_11/3_sperimentazione%20animale.pdf) preciso degli animali utilizzati nei vari scopi nel corso degli anni. Lascio a te il gravoso compito di verificare nelle tabelle le percentuali di utilizzo (pagina 5), ma preparati a delle sorprese. Nota come quello che ho trovato si riferisce al triennio 2007-9, e il trend sia in diminuzione: ora i numeri sono molto più bassi, principalmente grazie al fatto che abbiamo trovato metodi complementari e affinati che ci consentono di risparmiare usando meno animali.


&gt; Gli esperimenti di tossicità sono trasversali a tutte queste categorie (vengono effettuati in ognuna di esse) e rappresentano il 75% circa di tutti gli esperimenti su animali. Il 60% degli esperimenti viene fatto in laboratori privati, il 33% nelle scuole di medicina e università, il resto in laboratori pubblici e dipartimenti governativi.

Falso, stessa fonte di sopra.

&gt; Gli animali vengono devocalizzati, avvelenati, ustionati, accecati, affamati, mutilati, congelati, decerebrati, sottoposti a scariche elettriche, infettati, anche con virus che non colpiscono gli animali. Il 70% senza anestesia e il 30% con anestesia soltanto parziale.

Questa è la summa ultima di tutte le bugie. Presupponiamo che a me non freghi assolutamente nulla del dolore degli animali. Perchè dovrei fare anche una di quelle cose? Tra l'altro cosa vuol dire decerebrare un animale? Come sopravvive senza cervello? O_o E come fai ad infettarli con un virus che non li colpisce? E cos'è un'anestesia parziale? uno shottino di grappa? ma lol.. senza senso.. hanno scritto solo le prime cose che gli venivano in mente.

Anyway, qui il debunking è lunghissimo. Ogni esperimento che comporti dolore per l'animale superiore ad un ago inserito per un prelievo deve essere autorizzato dal Ministero della Salute, in deroga alla legge 116/92. Il ministero non approva studi simili, imponendo delle attenzioni pari o superiori a quelle per studi su umani. Sta al ricercatore inoltre dimostrare che lo studio è stato ottimizzato per ridurre il numero di animali utilizzati, che i risultati non sono già disponibili in altri laboratori, e soprattutto che la sofferenza imposta sia giustificata dall'utilità sociale dello studio. Tutti gli studi approvati sono pubblicamente disponibili sulla gazzetta ufficiale, essendo approvati con decreto ministeriale, ed è possibile richiedere i protocolli. Se stai pensando ""ma di sicuro in laboratori segreti fanno cose innominabili e non lo fanno sapere"" ti informo che le riviste su cui pubblichi articoli richiedono una serie di informazioni dettagliatissime sugli animali utilizzati (addirittura la loro dieta o l'ora del giorno in cui hai effettuato l'esperimento) per accertarsi che l'etica dello stesso sia al di sopra di ogni dubbio.

Per correttezza però confermo che esistono esperimenti di comportamento che presuppongono il digiuno per alcune ore (perchè si usa il cibo come premio, e l'animale dev'essere un po' motivato e avere un po' d'appetito), che esistevano (ma ormai non si usano più) esperimenti di condizionamento che prevedevano piccole scariche elettriche (molto più deboli di quelle dei recinti delle vacche, a bassa corrente. Provati sulla mia pelle, più un fastidio che un dolore. E' tipo una schicchera.) Per quanto riguarda le mutilazioni, esistono modelli animali di rimozione d'organo, tipo senza un rene, per valutare lo stesso problema negli umani. In ogni caso la chirurgia è eseguita in sala sterile, con anestesia, analgesici pre e post operatori, antibiotici, e le stesse cautele di un umano, altrimenti il lavoro viene male. Pure mia nonna aveva un solo rene (morso di vipera), ma fino a 97 anni ha rotto le palle senza problemi.

&gt; Pero' le sperimentazioni sugli animali sono fondamentali per i curriculum accademico. D'altra parte se la prassi e' questa e tu vuoi fare quel lavoro, non credo ti metta a fare l'eroe.

Esattamente come le operazioni chirurgiche sono fondamentali per il curriculum di un chirurgo. E' quello il lavoro. Ci sono grant da centinaia di migliaia di euro per la ricerca di metodi alternativi (ECVAM, Crack-It) che giacciono irreclamati perchè nessuno trova gli stessi. Per ora, ovviamente.

&gt; Rinnovo la mia tesi che sei un coglione.

Rinnova quel che ti pare, mentre spulci il materiale. Intanto rifletti sul fatto che, per colpa di gente che porta avanti opinioni ""di pancia"" come te, dando del coglione a chi lavora nel settore senza averne competenza, e con informazioni falsate in mano, ostacolano la salute di tutti, e giustificano (effettivamente proteggendo e dando immunità) a tutti i pazzi esaltati che attaccano i ricercatori e chi lavora per fare del bene. Da lì agli anti-vaccini il passo è breve. Di base quando all'opinione ""di pancia"" si da lo stesso valore di quella ""di testa"", si causano danni enormi. Alla luce dei quali, su quale delle due opinioni si addica tanto all'aggettivo ""coglione"" che tanto bene mi stai affibbiando, lascerò deciderela tua coscienza.

Per quanto riguarda l'etica, LuluWilson, credo di averne ben più di te, accettando i sensi di colpa di dover uccidere dei sorci in cambio della certezza di fare qualcosa di utile per l'umanità: nel mio gruppo di ricerca si lavora su asma, artrite, aborti spontanei, con ottimi risultati e pubblicazioni su riviste serie. Abbiamo tutti dei contrattini del cazzo e facciamo la fame, ma ci facciamo un culo così anche nei weekend per avere quei dati. E prima di usare anche un solo animale ci pensiamo parecchie volte, vuoi per i costi altissimi, ma soprattutto per etica. E non hai idea di quanto ci incazziamo quando un esperimento non viene e l'animale muore inutilmente (in rari casi capita, non lo nego), fa veramente incazzare e vai a casa con il groppo sullo stomaco. Non è un bel lavoro, e nessuno è felice di farlo.

Non ho conosciuto UNO scienziato, in tutta la mia carriera, così ipocrita da appellarsi a quella legge. Se vuoi fare preclinica, userai gli animali. Se non ti va di usarli, vai a fare biomolecolare o teorica o modelling o bioinformatica, ci son tante altre cose che puoi fare e che non richiederanno obiezione.

Mi hai giudicato incapace di parecchie cose.

&gt; Ti faccio un paragone: se tu smonti e riparli una fiat, e scopri che se l'auto s'ingolfa in un certo modo è il carburatore, e un giorno hai una ferrari che si ingolfa allo stesso modo, è ragionevole iniziare le tue indagini dal carburatore. Magari non è esatto (la scienza sull'animale non è esatta), ma è il miglior indizio che tu possa avere, senza smontare ferrari tutto il giorno.

Si, capisco questo punto di vista. Immaginavo qualcosa del genere.

&gt; Falso. I numeri sono molto più bassi.

&gt; Falso. I test sui cosmetici non si fanno più da tantissimo. Non conosco nessuno nel mio settore che abbia fatto mai test bellici di sorta, ma sul sito dell'Istituto Zooprofilatto Sperimentale c'è un rapporto preciso degli animali utilizzati nei vari scopi nel corso degli anni. 

&gt; Falso, stessa fonte di sopra.

Si, guarda, te l'ho detto, non ne so praticamente niente di sperimentazione animale, ho soltato googlato 2 minuti.

Le tue fonti sono sicuramente piu' accurate.

Comunque, 830.000 animali in un anno non sono pochissimi. Sono quasi 1 milione solo in italia. E 17 milioni negli USA e gli 11 milioni nel Giappone. In totale il tuo documento dice 50 milioni nel 2005. Non saranno 500 milioni (propaganda? fonti poco accurate?) ma sono comunque ""moltissimi"".

Comunque, ti ripeto, mi ci hai tirato tu sull'argomento della vivisezione. Non e' quello che mi preme maggiormente.

Ho scelto questa dieta soprattutto per etica, ecologismo e salutismo.

&gt; Questa è la summa ultima di tutte le bugie. Presupponiamo che a me non freghi assolutamente nulla del dolore degli animali. Perchè dovrei fare anche una di quelle cose? Tra l'altro cosa vuol dire decerebrare un animale? Come sopravvive senza cervello? O_o

Ma bho, magari per test di tolleranza al dolore, per test sull'efficacia di un farmaco o di un trattamento a seguito di stati traumatici (ustioni, congelamento), test per i vaccini, test per gli antidoti.

Qualcuno dovra' farli questi test, no? Se io voglio produrre il Foille devo avere una pelle bruciata da curare, no?

Sbaglio?

Poi e' indubbio che la ""propaganda"" esagera sempre.

&gt; Se stai pensando ""ma di sicuro in laboratori segreti fanno cose innominabili e non lo fanno sapere"" ti informo che le riviste su cui pubblichi articoli richiedono una serie di informazioni dettagliatissime sugli animali utilizzati (addirittura la loro dieta o l'ora del giorno in cui hai effettuato l'esperimento) per accertarsi che l'etica dello stesso sia al di sopra di ogni dubbio.

Non lo sto pensando. Non sono il tipo. Io non sono un complottista. Non credo che sia pieno di laboratori nascosti, bugie degli stati, massonerie e Mike Buongiorno.

Sbagli a fare l'equazione ""vegetariano = scemo credulone"". 

&gt; Anyway, qui il debunking è lunghissimo. Ogni esperimento che comporti dolore per l'animale superiore ad un ago inserito per un prelievo deve essere autorizzato dal Ministero della Salute, in deroga alla legge 116/92. Il ministero non approva studi simili, imponendo delle attenzioni pari o superiori a quelle per studi su umani. Sta al ricercatore inoltre dimostrare che lo studio è stato ottimizzato per ridurre il numero di animali utilizzati, che i risultati non sono già disponibili in altri laboratori, e soprattutto che la sofferenza imposta sia giustificata dall'utilità sociale dello studio. Tutti gli studi approvati sono pubblicamente disponibili sulla gazzetta ufficiale, essendo approvati con decreto ministeriale, ed è possibile richiedere i protocolli. 

Ci credo. Mi sembra normale.

&gt; Ci sono grant da centinaia di migliaia di euro per la ricerca di metodi alternativi (ECVAM, Crack-It) che giacciono irreclamati perchè nessuno trova gli stessi. Per ora, ovviamente.

Si, la mia speranza e' che questi metodi alternativi si trovino in fretta, ma non conosco lo stato della ricerca in tal senso.

Posso azzardare l'affermazione che questa ricerca e' stata velocizzata dalle continue proteste degli animalisti, o sarebbe andata avanti anche autonomamente?

&gt; Rinnova quel che ti pare, mentre spulci il materiale. Intanto rifletti sul fatto che, per colpa di gente che porta avanti opinioni ""di pancia"" come te, dando del coglione a chi lavora nel settore senza averne competenza, e con informazioni falsate in mano, ostacolano la salute di tutti, e giustificano (effettivamente proteggendo e dando immunità) a tutti i pazzi esaltati che attaccano i ricercatori e chi lavora per fare del bene.

C'e' ""gente"" e poi ci sono io.

Io non ostacolo un cazzo di niente, come non lo fa Lulu e come non lo fa nessuno dei vegetariani e vegani che conosco.

Quasi tutti siamo in qualche modo contro la sperimentazione animale ma al massimo potremmo firmare un referendum o leggere due libri.

La ""gente"" che va ad aprire le gabbie o manifestare contro Green Hill sara' nell'ordine dei 1000 in Italia.

**Ripeto: io stavo parlando solo di cibo**. **Mi rendo conto che il campo medico e' molto piu' complicato**.

* hanno manifestato per far sapere ai cittadini che il Parlamento ha agito in modo incostituzionale per modificare un articolo della Costituzione stessa (138), tra l'altro c'è la manifestazione il 12 ottobre indetta da Landini, Zagreberlsky, Rodotà e altri per protestare contro le ulteriori modifiche

* sono contrari alla realizzazione della TAV

* sono coerenti rispetto a quello che hanno detto che avrebbero fatto durante la campagna elettorale (restituzione parte stipendio e diaria, no a alleanze con i vecchi partiti, etc...)

* vogliono fare il referendum per l'uscita dall'euro che ritengo il minimo visto che non è stato fatto il referendum per entrare

* vogliono abolire il finanziamento pubblico ai partiti

How?

By removal of countries and their representatives.

On the night between Sunday and Monday, a male broke into a summer house in Parikkala, taking assorted property from the residence. The man loaded the stolen goods on a ridable lawn mower, and rode some 10 km in the dark of the night to Kesälahti. There, after running out of fuel, he broke into another summer house, where he again stole property – including a gardening tractor with a trailer, on which he loaded the stolen goods from this house. He also took the family's blueberries he found in the summer house's freezer. Riding away with this combination of vehicles, the suspect started to feel tired and fell asleep in his mode of transport at the side of the road. Passers-by notified the police, and the sleeping male was apprehended. The man has admitted his deeds in questioning. The stolen goods were mostly recovered, except for the blueberries that the man ate for himself.

- Shared competence, where Member States can do and act any way they want to UNTIL the European Union decides to get involved. This is the internal market, energy, consumer protection, etc…
- Support/coordination/supplement competence, areas where the EU can't do anything (make laws, use power) other than support, coordinate or supplement national laws. This is culture, tourism, education, etc…
- Arrangement competence, where the EU can't do anything other than force countries to coordinate policy. This is economic policy, employment, social policy.

Je pense cependant que l'ouverture le dimanche n'en détruirait pas et aurait au moins l'avantage de réduire la cohue du samedi, pas forcement bonne pour les affaires.
Le paragraphe de ton article sur l'effet de substitution est assez pertinent sur ce point et je pense que les gens renoncent en effet à des achats pour les raisons citées.
Pour les petits commerçants, certains ouvrent déjà le dimanche (c'est les patrons qui bossent ce jour-la) et je doute que beaucoup de commerces survivent uniquement 
sur les ventes réalisées ""quand brico est fermé"". J'ai peut-être tort, mais si je vais chez un petit commerçant, c'est avant tout pour le service et la proximité. 

&gt; Sinon, tu ne réponds pas à l'argument de Factran.

Selon moi, l'avantage dépasse l'inconvénient. Je pense qu'il y a assez de personnes volontaires pour travailler le dimanche pour que ces enseignes n'aient pas besoin de faire 
pression sur ceux qui ne le souhaitent pas. Dans plusieurs de mes jobs étudiants, les salariés avec des familles faisaient les shifts ""normaux"" et les étudiants et les célibataires se disputaient les shifts
nocturnes et dominicaux, mieux payés. Si un syndicaliste était venu m'expliquer que je me faisait exploiter je lui aurait ri au nez.

On était ""dégoutés"" de ne pas avoir de nuits ou de week-ends certains mois car cela signifiait devoir louper des cours pour certains ou ne pas boucler le mois financièrement pour d'autres.  
Après, il ne faut pas changer la loi n'importe comment ""à la française"" et mettre en place des dispositifs pour prévenir les abus.
Je ne suis pas spécialement de droite, je trouve que le capitalisme sauvage et l'entreprise toute-puissante sont dangereux, mais je trouve aussi que sur le sujet qui nous intéresse les syndicats feraient mieux 
de travailler à des solutions pour que personne ne soit lésé et que tout le monde y trouve son compte plutôt que de se borner à vouloir ""défendre"" des gens qui ne leur ont rien demandé.

true,Spaturno,"friuli ",,"&gt; Comunque, 830.000 animali in un anno non sono pochissimi. Sono quasi 1 milione solo in italia. E 17 milioni negli USA e gli 11 milioni nel Giappone. In totale il tuo documento dice 50 milioni nel 2005. Non saranno 500 milioni (propaganda? fonti poco accurate?) ma sono comunque ""moltissimi"".

Disinformazione mirata. Ce n'è un sacco, potrei citartene tante da farti rivoltare lo stomaco..  Non sono molti, ma se paragoni ai 40 milioni uccisi per le pellicce (brr... odio!), ai 51 miliardi di animali marini uccisi a scopo alimentare (dato riferito solo agli USA),  e agli 8.3 miliardi di animali terrestri, la quantità è irrisoria, come vedi.. semplicemente fa molta pubblicità farne casino, perchè muove voti (Santanchè) e finanziamenti (LAV ecc). Poco importa se questi servono davvero all'uomo, e le pellicce no: nessuno presidia gli allevamenti di pellicce (anche perchè li impallinano), ma la nuova moda è contestare la ricerca.

&gt; Si, la mia speranza e' che questi metodi alternativi si trovino in fretta, ma non conosco lo stato della ricerca in tal senso.
Posso azzardare l'affermazione che questa ricerca e' stata velocizzata dalle continue proteste degli animalisti, o sarebbe andata avanti anche autonomamente?

No, qui hai ragione. In molti sensi gli animalisti hanno aiutato, ma anche molti ricercatori. So che mi riderai in faccia ma ci sono tantissimi ricercatori animalisti che usano animali, e che fanno molto, MOLTO più del minimo indispensabile per proteggerli e minimizzarne l'uso.

Non volevo fare l'equazione vegetariano = scemo credulone, tuttavia è molto alta nei vegetariani la percentuale di persone che trovano molto più facile informarsi su facebook piuttosto che andare alle fonti. E il fenomeno di disinformazione che si propaga sta facendo dei danni INENARRABILI. Per esempio, adesso vogliono vietare l'allevamento sul territorio nazionale di cani per ricerca. Figata, dirai tu. Solo che, non potendo vietare l'USO degli stessi, questi cani verranno allevati in Polonia e si faranno decine di ore di camion per arrivare nei laboratori. Inoltre, essendo gli standard qualitativi degli allevamenti polacchi meno monitorati dei nostri, alcuni arriveranno malaticci o spossati, e questo vuol dire che per avere gli stessi risultati dovremo utilizzare molti più cani. E siamo incazzatissimi per questo. Motivo per cui la mia sovrareazione contro gli animalisti. Credo tu possa capire. :)

Purtroppo il metodo alternativo assoluto è per definizione un asindoto. Puoi avere un modello predittivo al 100% solamente quando conosci al 100% il funzionamento degli organismi e a quel punto a che ti serve un modello, se sai già tutto? Non serve nemmeno più il modello in assoluto, basta fare prove su Simulatore di Umano.

C'è ""gente"" e poi ci sei tu. Vero. Ma Gente è fatta da tanti individui come te, a cui gli ""Animalisti Quelli Cattivi"" hanno dato in pasto un sacco di bugie, a cui è molto facile credere, perchè ricadono perfettamente nell'idea assurda che siamo degli aguzzini per qualche motivo non meglio precisato.

Anche io sono contro la sperimentazione animale, potendo farne a meno. Sono anche contro la povertà nel mondo, la gente che muore di fame, le città, la guerra, gli omicidi. Poi c'è il mondo reale, che purtroppo ci impone di usare la sperimentazione animale per sopravvivere.

Quei 1000 terroristi (*) fanno quel che fanno perchè hanno l'appoggio popolare, e ce l'hanno solo perchè la gente non capisce che, nel momento in cui liberi 10 topi, hai ritardato di 10 anni una cura su una malattia. Oltre ad aver ucciso i topi, in quanto spesso non possono fisicamente vivere in ambiente non sterile, essendo [privi di sistema immunitario](http://www.harlan.com/pricing_and_promotions/scid_mice_row.hl?gclid=CIbio5aP8bkCFcxF3godJUwAKg). Nel momento in cui mi dici ""non ostacolo niente"" solo perchè non agisci in prima persona sei come uno che dice ""sono contro la guerra in medio oriente"" mentre fa il pieno della macchina. Se chiedi a qualcuno ""Sei contro la guerra?"" risponde di sì. Se chiedi a qualcuno ""Sei disposto a pagare la benzina 15 euro al litro pur di ritirarci dal mediooriente?"" non credo che riscuoterai lo stesso successo. Allo stesso modo, se chiedi alla gente se è contro la sperimentaizone animale (magari chiamandola erroneamente vivisezione) l'86% ti risponde di sì. Se gli chiedi se sono disposti a rinunciare al Servizio Sanitario Nazionale per salvare 830.000 topi all'anno, ti ci mandano e pure in fretta.

Io lavoro nel campo della cura degli animali da laboratorio. Mi occupo di topi, ratti e conigli. Mi prendo cura di loro e mi accerto che stiano nelle migliori condizioni possibili. Ho fatto un AMA tempo fa, ma resto a tua disposizione per qualsiasi domanda a cui rispondero, ove possibile con massima trasparenza.

true,peripatos,UNSA,USA,"WLAN liability is exceedingly tricky.

To begin with, if a file is illegally downloaded over a wifi connection, it's presumed that the controller of the wifi connection downloaded it -- this presumption is reinforced when the wifi is protected, since this means access by third parties is prevented (excepting in cases of hacking).

It's different when the wifi is made available to third parties (like you) as a matter of course, or on account of commercial purposes, e.g. if you are operating wifi in a cafe, or in a vacation rental.

That is the case here.

If the controller of the wifi connection was not near the connection, and if you were using the wifi connection exclusively during the time in which the file was illegally downloaded, the controller would be able to implicate you to remove his own liability, as here.

Your case is different from liability for unprotected wifi, since you were specifically given access to it, so the BGH case law on failing to impose a password and/or sufficiently secure password doesn't apply.

Since this isn't a criminal issue, given the facts, you are indeed ""liable until proven innocent"" -- it's the same in this case under US law. You can't avoid civil liability simply by disputing that you downloaded the file since you were the only one in the area at the time, the only person with access to the wifi connection at the time, and the violation of copyright occurred while you were visiting. So, if the shoe fits...

You would need to present facts to demonstrate that, in spite of the above facts, someone other than you downloaded the file. If you know someone who did, and it was not you, then you should present this information. As for your damages, they would be limited here. In the US, damages can often go into the stratosphere. In Germany, four figure amounts are far more common, including attorney fees.

""What can (and should) I do in this case?""

Nobody can or should answer this question without seeing all of the correspondence and information involved. You should go and find a lawyer to represent your interests. This is a serious matter and probably will not be dropped. That said, EUR 450 is quite cheap. Most of the settlement offers I've seen have been in the EUR 800-900 range.

If you have questions feel free to ask.

I will happily answer them up to the bounds of a first consultation under German RVG.

If one considers that cultural clashes were enough to cause both the current Scottish independence movement and the Catalonian independence movement, one could imagine that a federal Europe would be plagued with nationalist movements clogging up parliament. 
* The economic divide - the eurozone crisis showed the risk presented by countries with a weaker economic infrastructure.  A federal Europe would need to massively invest in making sure every state is up at the same standard, otherwise the weaker states risk dragging Europe's economic down.
* The democratic weakness - A huge amount of work is needed in making the European government is as democratic and accountable as possible... which at the moment it simply isn't...
* Most of the countries in the EU have some incredibly well established institutions and governmental structures, the amount of resources required to refit all these structures to work in a federal system would be phenomenal.... and I can imagine about a million asterisks trying to set some precedence under which the Queen Elizabeth II stays relevant... speaking of which...

true,Baloo715,null,null,"No. I was making a point that there is a trend that people are moving away from politics based on ideology and more towards politics based on positivism and empiricism. This is the trend based on the fulfilment of certain criteria. There is more ""voting with your brain than with your gut"". This is opposed to elections in other places, say for example, in Egypt. Better yet, look at Iraq where people don't vote for mass parties but instead opt for voting blocks and candidates that represent their religious/sectarian beliefs. 
Now, from a marketing perspective, in a European parliamentarian system you TEND to have two big parties and then several smaller parties that carve out a niche for themselves. Sometimes it is for a single issue and the party disappears after the issue is cleared. Other times, there might be a persistent issue, and as the party grows they begin to reach into other areas that they previously did not encroach upon. This is true for the greens. They are not a mass party but they are a part of the political mainstream. Sometimes, this helps a smaller party turn into a mass party. 
Sadly, there is also a market for politics of hate and fear. Under certain conditions these can be effectively exploited. Remember, some people don't drink more coke than water because they think it's healthy. They do so because they think it's normal. Through effective marketing campaigns, this thought of normality is constantly reinforced. e.g. coke ads at football games. If we look at the political end of things, sadly, fear, hatred and racism have become a part of norm. They are an accepted way of talking about issues during political discourse. The migration issue is a very important issue of our time, but the way that is is discussed will lead to a lose-lose scenario should anything of policy come of fruit from the far right. Politics is complicated, sophisticated, and incredibly difficult. What worries me is when solutions are not based on facts and evidence, but based on impulse and emotion. Liberal democracy, to this end, requires a lot of micromanagement to help iron out the kinks and cracks that those with the worst intentions might try to take advantage of. This is because up until the enlightenment, the question of politics was, ""who should rule"". The enlightenment tried to figure out, ""How do we limit the damage that can be caused by those who do rule.

La cosa che mi piace della tua sintesi è come evidenzi bene due dei problemi del PD.

Il primo è interno e strutturale, e volgarmente viene indicato come il problema della doppia anima (ex ‘comunisti’ ed ex ‘democrazia cristiana’), che mette assieme gente che in realtà in comune ha ben poco, politicamente parlando. Il risultato è un partito che si può permettere di mettere un _front man_ che porta avanti certe idee, anche quando una buona fetta dei candidati al parlamento non necessariamente le condivide.

E questo ci porta al secondo problema, che è invece endemico della politica italiana e benché sia stato amplificato del Porcellum sussisteva anche prima: il voto dato “al partito” piuttosto che “alle persone”. (Faccio presente che il problema si presentava anche quando vi era ancora la possibilità di esprimere il voto di preferenza, benché attutito.) 

Cosa succede allora? Mettiamo che un partito abbia appunto esponenti che la pensano diversamente (idee A ed idee B): l'ordine in cui questi verranno messi in lista diventa _essenziale_ per determinare il percorso politico _reale_ del partito: se metti in ordine AABBBAAAAA, e salgono solo i primi cinque, hai una maggioranza di parlamentari che la pensa diversamente dal partito, _ma_ che domina in parlamento.

Il est clair que Ben Gourion a suivi une double politique :

- Élargir les frontières de l'État au maximum. Ben Gourion refuse pendant cette période les propositions du représentant de l'ONU, Folke Bernadotte pour la résolution du conflit, qu'il estime territorialement trop peu intéressantes. Folke Bernadotte sera d'ailleurs assassiné à Jérusalem à l'été 1948, par un commando du Lehi. Ben Gourion condamne l'assassinat. Le Lehi est dissous, mais les dirigeants du Lehi, condamnés, sont libérés après deux semaines. Le tireur du commando (Yeoshua Cohen) deviendra plus tard le garde du corps de Ben Gourion. Encore aujourd'hui, certains s'interrogent sur le rôle de Ben Gourion dans cet assassinat. L'hypothèque de l'ONU levée, Ben Gourion mène une politique offensive de conquêtes territoriales (comme les opérations Hiram et dix plaies).

Now, a lot of people don't care about this (including the government), and just wanted him out of the country.

The media then push this view. They go rabid over any case where someone, often foreign born/brown skinned, take the UK to the ECHR and get a ruling for them. They then don't push forward other stories where people take the UK to the ECHR for more reasonable cases (even though apparently wanting fair justice isn't reasonable). This leads people to having a one sided view of the ECHR, thinking it only keeps foreign criminals in the country.

There is also this 'hangings to good for 'em' attitude, where people think prisons should be just for punishment, and they have absolutely no sympathy or even empathy for prisoners. This means they don't care whether a person may be tortured or not get justice, as they have broken the law and therefore give up the rights not to be. 

The ECHR is also European, and a lot of people will automatically not like it just because of that, even though Britain had a major part in its inception.

I've brought it up a lot in this thread, but I think the main case which turned a lot of people off the ECHR was the Abu Qatarda one. Now, the courts said the reason he couldn't be deported was because he would not face a fair trial in Jordan, with evidence possibly being taken from torture. It was pretty straight forward. 

The issue was, many people did not care. Because they didn't like him, they didn't care if he wouldn't get fair justice, they just wanted him out of the country, as did the government. This isn't trying to justify the court ruling, this is trying to justify to someone why every deserves fair justice, which is much more difficult when the person just doesn't give a shit and will ignorantly say they want him out of the country.

Also I feel the government have pushed it, partially for the popularist vote, and partially because it gives them more power. If they wrote some sort of British Human Rights act, not only would it allow them to ship people off to countries where they could be tortured (because 'we don't like them' is apparently a good enough legal precedent), but they would probably remove a lot more of the rights of the actual people within the UK.

Dimostra brillantemente la coglionaggine —mi si permetta— degli esponenti grillini, ovvero la loro totale incapacità a comprendere i meccanismi fondamentali della politica (non la ‘vecchia’ politica, ma la _politica_), nonché la loro totale incapacità di prendere iniziative che non siano le direttive del Grande Capo.

Tra persone _intelligenti_, quando ci si trova in una situazione del genere le cose procedono cosí:

* chi propone parte dalla concessione _minima_;
* chi ‘dispone’ rilancia, chiedendo qualcosa che sa che non verrà accettato;
* si gioca al rialzo e ribasso fino a trovare un accordo (se possibile).

Veniamo al caso specifico.

La proposta _di base_ non poteva essere altro che l'appoggio esterno: governo PD con appoggio anche del M5S e con l'obiettivo di realizzare i punti comuni dei rispettivi programmi.

A questo punto c'erano tre scelte per il M5S:

* accettare di dare l'appoggio esterno per la nomina del governo, pronti ad una mozione di sfiducia al primo passo fuori dal seminato: una scelta possibile, ma rischiosa per la possibilità del PDL di appoggiare il governo PD su punti con i quali il M5S non era d'accordo; 
* chiedere una partecipazione attiva nel governo; in questo caso, il M5S avrebbe avuto il coltello dalla parte del manico nella contrattazione; ad esempio, avrebbe potuto chiedere i ministeri associati ai punti piú importanti del loro programma;
* rifiutare qualunque tipo di coinvolgimento nell'attività di governo.

Le prime due erano scelte che avrebbe fatto chiunque avesse avuto come _principale_ obiettivo la realizzazione del proprio programma, giacché erano le uniche che ne davano la possibilità. La terza era la scelta i chi riteneva che costringere il PD a cercare alleanze altrove (e quindi con il PDL) fosse _piú importante_ che realizzare il proprio programma.

Scegliendo la terza, i grillini hanno brillantemente dimostrato di avere priorità diverse dalla realizzazione del proprio programma. D'altra parte, con un Grillo che blatera di maggioranze bulgare (“vogliamo il 100%”) la cosa non sorprende, ed è facile intuire quali siano queste priorità.

D'altra parte, come la sinistra vecchio stampo sa bene, è molto piú comodo stare all'opposizione e fingere che ad impedire la realizzazione del proprio programma sia la maggioranza che non stare al governo e dimostrare che le cause sono ben altre (Pizzarotti docet).

I'm Pro-EU and even I'm pissed off at the referendum debacle. His tactics of using the public to vote and then fobb them off has disappointed people. It's leading to the rise of UKIP.

* A Croatia Airlines plane made an emergency landing in Zurich after its front landing gear would not come down. The pilots are being praised for their calm and composure during the ordeal in which nobody was injured. The plane seems to have sustained only minor damage. A personal anecdote, Croatia Airlines pilots have some of the softest landings I've ever experienced, so I wasn't too surprised about how well they handled this.

* A football match was marred by violence last night. It started when the away supporters started throwing flares, rocks, and seats into the adjacent section which is a ""family-friendly"" stand in which no organized supporters/ultras sit. The police then proceeded to clear the family-friendly stand with dogs and tear gas, which prompted the home supporters to try to make their way over from the opposite end. They were met with another cordon of police and a fight broke out there. The visiting team was later pelted with bottles and wine glasses by a wedding party that was taking place at their hotel. Altogether it's a huge mess and stadium security is once again a hot topic. Stadia are generally quite safe in Croatia and incidents are rare (they happen moreso outside of the grounds between the ultras and are limited to some punches until the police arrive). I'm biased (I'm from the the city that hosted the match and support the home club), but it all started with a few morons among the visiting support who thought it'd be fun to hurt ordinary people.

* The same city in which the football mess happened was flooded by a ridiculous amount of rain today. In hindsight, too bad it didn't rain out the match. As part of the same storm, Pula (lolRomanianslol) witnessed a few water spouts.

I get that, I totally understand that people think he should be thrown in the channel.

In addition, this way of thinking motivates the use of different layers of governance based on the locality of each issue. General issues that affect many people are delegated to national or international institutions whereas more local issues are delegated to municipal or provincial institutions.

I don't believe it is a majority. If a majority of people held this view, the Tories would have gotten a majority at the last election and UKIP would be doing a lot better. I think it's a case that a significant, vocal minority or against it, and it ties in with the anti-immigration and anti-EU sentiment.

&gt; Some people are so stupid that I do not understand how they breathe. 

To an extent, but I think a lot of people think we should have full control over our Human Rights policy, not a multi-national body. I can sort of understand it, but when I have the choice between the ECHR, or a government who is obviously willing to be compliant in torture, lack of justice, and aside from all the stuff they complain about a lot of other things where they'll remove peoples rights, I'm much happier with the ECHR. I think the ECHR is fair to everyone, whereas I think a British Human Rights Act would only be fair to those the government need to be fair to. 

&gt; Hmm, aren't they signing away a lot of their rights too? I know, we have had people from Sweden (as in ethnical Swedes, not brown people that we can call foreign.......)who has won cases against Sweden. I am sure ethnical Brits have won cases there too. 

Exactly. If you search for 'list of uk court cases in the european court of human rights', or something like that, you can find a nice PDF from [parliament.uk](http://www.parliament.uk/), listing all the UK cases in the ECHR, including the famous Abu Qatarda one, and they all seem pretty reasonable. 

However, the media and government always skim over these, only focussing on the more controversial ones (which, as I said, we should be supporting anyway, as they often come down to guaranteeing someone the right not to be tortured or have a fair trial, which is apparently too good for criminals and foreigners), so people get a biased view of it. And you'll also always have the people which thing a foreign body shouldn't be telling us what to do (again, something which would only benefit politicians. Why should I care if it is someone from London or someone from Strasbourg making the rule? It's not like I have a choice in what either of them do anyway, and at least the ECHR seems to be standing up for Human Rights in general, not just those our government and right-wing papers like. Nationalism is silly IMO, but that's neither here nor now).

In the same vein, some older high rises are really impressive given the relative lack of technology when they were built.

Ironically there are many buildings around it that dwarf it in size.) To me these old buildings are almost more awe inspiring than the much taller Sears, Trump, and Hancock buildings (in Chicago or taller elsewhere). 

Both styles are comparing apples and oranges. If you adjust for the time period old European churches and such were built, they are almost ""more awesome"".

For instance using a current examples in my country a majority of people support legalisation of Mirijuana and Gay Marriage yet central parties most likely in fear of displeasing a minority conservative base will not make the change, this system would allow the people to collect signatures demand votes and democratically enact the change without worrying about having to trust Politicians.

true,sberla54,null,null,"&gt; Disinformazione mirata. Ce n'è un sacco, potrei citartene tante da farti rivoltare lo stomaco.. Non sono molti, ma se paragoni ai 40 milioni uccisi per le pellicce (brr... odio!), ai 51 miliardi di animali marini uccisi a scopo alimentare (dato riferito solo agli USA), e agli 8.3 miliardi di animali terrestri, la quantità è irrisoria, come vedi.. semplicemente fa molta pubblicità farne casino, perchè muove voti (Santanchè) e finanziamenti (LAV ecc). Poco importa se questi servono davvero all'uomo, e le pellicce no: nessuno presidia gli allevamenti di pellicce (anche perchè li impallinano), ma la nuova moda è contestare la ricerca.

Bhe in realta' c'e' moltissima gente, sempre nel ""movimento"" vegetariano, che protesta anche contro le pellicce. Anzi, da quel punto di vista li siamo di piu' e piu' compatti, dato che c'e' poco da studiare e disquisire.

Googlando un attimo [l'ultima protesta e' stata 15 giorni fa](http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2013/09/17/vogue-fashion-night-animalisti_n_3941153.html). Forse se ne parla meno perche' sono quasi sempre solo azioni dimostrative come quella che ha dato il via a questo topic, non creano danni e forse ormai annoiano.

Anche io ho molto piu' a cuore la questione del cibo perche' i numeri, in tutti i sensi, sono enormemente piu' grandi.

&gt; No, qui hai ragione. In molti sensi gli animalisti hanno aiutato, ma anche molti ricercatori. So che mi riderai in faccia ma ci sono tantissimi ricercatori animalisti che usano animali, e che fanno molto, MOLTO più del minimo indispensabile per proteggerli e minimizzarne l'uso.

No bhe, non mi fa ridere, posso capirlo. Anche a me piacerebbe fare il ricercatore (in linea teorica, dato che non ho mai studiato niente di simile) e mi troverei davanti ad un dilemma etico ma non vorrei abbandonare le aspirazioni personali di studio e di carriera solo per questo.

Ma per fortuna ho scelto di fare altro.

&gt; Non volevo fare l'equazione vegetariano = scemo credulone, tuttavia è molto alta nei vegetariani la percentuale di persone che trovano molto più facile informarsi su facebook piuttosto che andare alle fonti. E il fenomeno di disinformazione che si propaga sta facendo dei danni INENARRABILI. Per esempio, adesso vogliono vietare l'allevamento sul territorio nazionale di cani per ricerca. Figata, dirai tu. Solo che, non potendo vietare l'USO degli stessi, questi cani verranno allevati in Polonia e si faranno decine di ore di camion per arrivare nei laboratori. Inoltre, essendo gli standard qualitativi degli allevamenti polacchi meno monitorati dei nostri, alcuni arriveranno malaticci o spossati, e questo vuol dire che per avere gli stessi risultati dovremo utilizzare molti più cani. E siamo incazzatissimi per questo. Motivo per cui la mia sovrareazione contro gli animalisti. Credo tu possa capire. :)

Questa cosa dell'allevare le cavie all'estero e' effettivamente un peggioramento della situazione, anche secondo me. Non e' una cosa intelligente.

Pero' bho, dire che molti vegetariani si informano su Facebook e' sempre un po' una generalizzazione. Molti di noi leggono un sacco di libri (di autori seri), guardano un sacco di documentari, magari vanno ad un paio di convegni l'anno (lo faccio anche io, se riesco).

Ovviamente ce ne sono anche altri che vengono fulminati sulla via di Damasco e dal giorno alla notte credono di sapere tutto della zootecnia e degli equilibri mondiali. Gente che crede che il microonde ti uccida, che le scie chimiche siano ""ragionevoli"" e cazzate simili.

E' chiaro che mi da molto fastidio far parte di un club nel quale sono iscritti anche loro, per cosi' dire.

&gt; Purtroppo il metodo alternativo assoluto è per definizione un asindoto. Puoi avere un modello predittivo al 100% solamente quando conosci al 100% il funzionamento degli organismi e a quel punto a che ti serve un modello, se sai già tutto? Non serve nemmeno più il modello in assoluto, basta fare prove su Simulatore di Umano.

Ma al momento c'e' qualcosa di promettente?

Non so, test su cellule create in laboratorio, modelli informatici, roba simile? O ci siamo ancora lontani?

Per il resto capisco il tuo ragionamento.

Ma la sperimentazione sull'uomo, su volontari? E' eticamente una barbarie? Magari, che ne so, dei galeotti a cui si offre uno sconto di pena. (In effetti sembra una barbarie gia' solo a dirlo..)

&gt; Quei 1000 terroristi (*) fanno quel che fanno perchè hanno l'appoggio popolare, e ce l'hanno solo perchè la gente non capisce che, nel momento in cui liberi 10 topi, hai ritardato di 10 anni una cura su una malattia. Oltre ad aver ucciso i topi, in quanto spesso non possono fisicamente vivere in ambiente non sterile, essendo privi di sistema immunitario. Nel momento in cui mi dici ""non ostacolo niente"" solo perchè non agisci in prima persona sei come uno che dice ""sono contro la guerra in medio oriente"" mentre fa il pieno della macchina. Se chiedi a qualcuno ""Sei contro la guerra?"" risponde di sì. Se chiedi a qualcuno ""Sei disposto a pagare la benzina 15 euro al litro pur di ritirarci dal mediooriente?"" non credo che riscuoterai lo stesso successo. Allo stesso modo, se chiedi alla gente se è contro la sperimentaizone animale (magari chiamandola erroneamente vivisezione) l'86% ti risponde di sì. Se gli chiedi se sono disposti a rinunciare al Servizio Sanitario Nazionale per salvare 830.000 topi all'anno, ti ci mandano e pure in fretta.

Si, e' molto complicato, me ne rendo conto. ""Only a sith deals in absolutes"" mio Padawan. Ma per molti ragionare per assoluti e' assolutamente necessario, per sentirsi dalla parte giusta della barricata. O anche solo per riuscire a prendere una posizione, perche' la gente vuol sapere se stai con loro o contro di loro.

Pero', come vedi, anche l'ALF e compagnia non e' che abbia ""l'appoggio popolare"". Anche io ho dei dubbi. Certo, mi viene da dire che siano dei ""ribelli romantici"", spinti da ""nobili ideali"", pero' non so quanto concordi coi loro metodi.

Pero' non puoi attribuirmi le loro colpe. 

&gt; Io lavoro nel campo della cura degli animali da laboratorio. Mi occupo di topi, ratti e conigli. Mi prendo cura di loro e mi accerto che stiano nelle migliori condizioni possibili. Ho fatto un AMA tempo fa, ma resto a tua disposizione per qualsiasi domanda a cui rispondero, ove possibile con massima trasparenza.

Avresti dovuto dirmelo subito.

Hai il link dell'AMA?

Comunque, spero capirai perche' mi prudono le mani ogni volta che vengo a fare un giro su Reddit (o su Facebook) e mi devo vedere le prese per il culo e gli insulti ai ""vegani"", cosi', a gratis.

Ci sono delle motivazioni articolare e complicate, dietro, in tutti i vari aspetti, che sono molteplici anche loro.

Ad esempio, uno degli aspetti più controversi della democrazia è che tutti, almeno come principio, hanno diritto di voto e di espressione. Sia gli elementi che fanno il bene della società, sia quelli che non lo fanno. E perché chi danneggia la società dovrebbe essere considerato al pari degli altri quando si tratta di decidere per tutti? Non dovrebbe e dovrebbe essere penalizzato nell'uso delle risorse comuni. Per questo in casi estremi esiste il sistema giudiziario che sin dalle società più primitive, in qualche modo ci mette  una pezza. Però non cattura tutte le sfaccettature, perché è limitato. Va bene per i ladri di polli o i frodatori fiscali, per gli assassini e i vandali, ma ad esempio, non potrà mai essere in grado di intervenire per danni alla collettività che riguardano le opinioni. 

In democrazia tutti hanno voce, anche chi promuove l'idea che siamo tutti condizionati dai rettiliani e controllati dalle scie chimiche, giusto per fare un esempio. E come fai a dire che loro non possono parlare? Chi lo decide? Se lo fai decidere al sistema giudiziario, dopo un po' ritorni al fascismo e giustamente se proponi questa opzione, ti cazziano. E quindi come si fa a far esprimere, votare, ""decidere"" solo quelli che collaborano al benessere sociale, che hanno coscienza critica e consapevolezza e che farebbero il bene della collettività? In democrazia, comunque la giri, non ce la fai, perché uccidi il fondamento della democrazia stessa, ovvero che siamo tutti egualmente meritevoli di esprimerci. Sappiamo però che tutto ciò espone il fianco alla stupidità delle masse, che dirotta gli intenti democratici e mette tutto il sistema in mano a pochi, tendenzialmente quelli che gestiscono ""il capitale"", chiudendo il sistema in un circolo di ignoranza legittimante per cui la Democrazia è l'unica via anche se non funziona e non funziona per lo stesso motivo per cui sopravvive.

Quindi, la mia umilissima idea è che se siamo bloccati in questa situazione di stallo parziale e non sostenibile, in cui, sopratutto in paesi con una classe politica becera come l'Italia e gli USA, dove il benessere non deriva da un uso intelligente delle risorse a disposizione ma solo dal progresso tecnologico (grazie al cielo), dall'accumulo di debito e da altri fattori non sostenibili, allora l'unica opzione è cambiare totalmente il modello.

Però non sono un illuso e so che in Italia la democrazia non è in grado di riflettere su sé stessa ed è ""blindata"" da una costituzione, da una classe politica, da una cultura e da un'elité culturale creati dal terrore sacrosanto del fascismo e che per  non lasciare spazio al fascismo, soffoca anche tutte le possibilità di superamento della democrazia.

The closer a system comes to that ideal, the more democratic I consider it, and vice versa.

Now, I'm not saying that under that definition more democracy is always desirable (although that's generally true for me). For instance: the fact that systems as big as countries or unions of countries can only function through representative democracy makes them intrinsecally a little less democratic, but that's okay. Also, some limits like a series of inalienable human rights are in my opinion a good thing, and serve to prevent some problems present in pure democracies, like tyrannies of the majorities. On the other hand, there are factors that hurt democracy and are detrimental to society, like electoral systems where for one reason or another people are compelled or forced to vote for parties that don't represent their will.

Pure io ho protestato contro le pellicce!

&gt; Ma al momento c'e' qualcosa di promettente?
&gt; Non so, test su cellule create in laboratorio, modelli informatici, roba simile? O ci siamo ancora lontani?

Sisì!! Due test piuttosto brutali sono stati completamente sostituiti da modelli sintetici: si tratta del terribile Draize test di irritazione della cornea di coniglio, che ora si fa su occhio espiantato o su cornea sintetica, e i test di corrosione cutanea, che ora si fa su pelle sintetica coltivata in vitro.

Questi sono gli unici metodi ALTERNATIVI che mi vengano in mente.

Poi però ci sono tanti metodi COMPLEMENTARI, che servono comunque molto. Con metodi statistici avanzati posso usare il 10% degli animali di una volta. grazie alla standardizzazione altissima posso ridurre l'errore statistico quasi a zero, e fare test con 4-5 animali per gruppo invece di 50-100. Pensa che per alcuni articoli che abbiamo pubblicato, con sistemi di caso-controllo siamo riusciti ad usare soli SEI topi.

La sperimentazione sull'uomo si fa già, e si fa per OGNI farmaco. Solitamente la procedura è: prima fai dei test teorici su alcune sostanze. Poi prendi quelle che dovrebbero funzionare meglio, e fai delle prove di tossicità in colture cellulari umane immortalizzate, in vitro. Purtroppo la sperimentazione in vitro non è cruelty-free, perchè tra gli ingredienti dei terreni di coltura si deve usare il siero fetale bovino. Quando hai sostanze che danno gli effetti desiderati e non sono tossiche per le cellule, prendi le due-tre migliori e fai dei test a bassi dosaggi su animali, per vedere la tossicità sistemica. Se sono ben tollerate, prendi un modello sperimentale della patologia che stai indagando e provi a stabilire dal basso il dosaggio: se è efficace prima di essere tossico, la sostanza è un buon candidato, e lo provi un un'altra specie, per essere sicuro che non ci siano casi particolari in cui la sostanza ha effetto particolare su una specie e non sulle altre. Solitamente provi topo o ratto, e cavia.
Una volta che hai una sostanza che non è tossica, ed è efficace, puoi procedere nel determinare il modo migliore di somministrarla. Prendi un animale, e provi a dargliela col cibo, iniettata, intramuscolo, e vedi quale formulazione è migliore e da meno effetti collaterali. Solitamente nessun animale soffre/muore in questa fase, anche se può non essere vero per farmaci destinati a far soffrire/morire anche gli umani che li prendono, come ad esempio gli antitumorali ""ultima chance"", che dai in via estrema ai malati terminali.
Una volta stabilito il delivery e accertata la tolleranza, solitamente si passa al beagle, perchè è l'animale con la farmacocinetica più simile all'umano. Sono cani costosissimi e super addestrati (tramite gioco, so che non ci crederai ma c'è gente PAGATA per giocare coi beagle tutto il giorno, fortunati loro). L'addestratore suona un clicker, il cane salta sul tavolo, gli somministri la sostanza, e poi si effettuano prelievi di sangue, di urine, o altre prove simili, a tempi prefissati, per capire quanta e come va in circolo.
Una volta stabilito, può capitare che sia richiesto (ma di solito no) lo step sulle scimmie (marmoset), per casi particolari. Se anche nelle scimmie tutto è regolare si passa all'uomo: un numero ristretto di volontari si fa lo stesso trattamento del beagle (ma senza clicker, usano gli euro). Questo fa molto buffo, perchè quando gli animalisti ci gridano ""FATELO SUGLI UMANI!"" in realtà già lo facciamo.

Una volta finito il trial clinico di fase I, si passa ad un numero più ampio, durante questo periodo si raccolgono feedback su effetti collaterali imprevisti, ed eventualmente si ritira il farmaco. Se il farmaco è approvato, viene rilasciato,e per X anni si continua un monitoraggio su chi lo riceve, accentrando tutti i dati per vedere se succede qualcosa di strano.

Inoltre c'erano voti sparsi tra Cancellieri, D'Alema, Marini e altri, se ben ricordo.

Il tutto faceva pensare che qualcuno del csx avesse votato candidati diversi da Prodi e che, viceversa, qualcuno dall'esterno avesse votato Prodi.

Se il target è 504 e tu disponi di 498 voti sicuri, i 6 voti mancanti li trovi, nelle votazioni successive (Prodi era nella rosa dei 10 papabili del M5S, inoltre era apprezzato da Scelta Civica e qualche parlamentare sparso).

Da tutto questo sono convinto che, se il csx fosse stato compatto su Prodi, non ci sarebbero stati dubbi sulla sua elezione.

Ma, se anche mi stessi sbagliando, il dato politico è rimasto quello della spaccatura del csx sul suo nome.. e la conseguene apertura alle larghe intese.

Providing a better service in this context means providing better infrastructure or education for your taxes, you choose what service you use by deciding where to live and work, opting for a better service would therefore mean to actually move to Switzerland and pay taxes there as I previously mentioned. 

In regards to where to draw the line between acceptable tax avoidance and unacceptable tax avoidance I would say that tax avoidance is unacceptable as soon as a state does not allow you to ""opt-out"" of their service by moving somewhere else/renouncing your citizenship or doing/owning nothing that would cause taxes, because in that case it essentially forces you to use their ""service"" at gunpoint, like North-Korea.

When it comes to the application countries like Switzerland should simply put an end to their banks helping people to avoid taxes alltogether in my opinion, simply because the majority of people that avoid taxes should actually be paying them (e.g because they drive on the roads/send their kids to schools other people paid for).

true,ThePhlogist,ENGL,England,"The ECHR has handed down some unpopular decisions recently. They decided that the blanket ban on prisoners voting was illegal which all politicians seems to declare was ridiculous in order to look tough on crime. The Abu Qatada thing was also a bit embarrassing for the government and they just blamed the ECtHR instead. It was in the news for weeks and weeks. Combine that with the Eurozone crisis, the constant European negotiations, the rise of UKIP (an anti-European, anti-immigration party) and a press that openly supports leaving the EU and criticised ECHR judgements as well you end up with a public who are being fed nothing but bad news about the EU and ECHR. The Conservatives and David Cameron have been trying to lean further right to stop people leaving their party and so he has started saying more anti-EU, anti-ECHR, anti-immigrant things so as not to split the right wing vote. His was the only credible right-wing party for 100 years and now there is a new one it threatens to split the vote giving the left a helping hand. 

Now you have the Prime Minister being more anti-EU his party members with more extreme views start speaking up and threatening to leave the party if he doesn't agree to their ideas. Then after the Queen's speech (where the government announces what it will do in the next year) some Conservatives rebels published an [alternative Queen's speech](http://www.conservativehome.com//thetorydiary/2013/06/the-alternative-queens-speech-the-full-list-of-40-rebel-bills.html) effectively saying what they wished the government would do. They involve bringing back the death penalty, leaving the EU, [a similar 3 strikes system as US criminal law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_strikes_law), basically de-fund the BBC, stop funding for Green/environmental projects, disallow immigrants from using public services and withdrawal from the ECHR among others - there are 40 points. While none of these will get enacted it put pressure on Cameron to move further right to appease them. 

For a while now politics has been very extreme and seemingly many many people have a lot to gain from spreading scary statistics and persuading everyone that everything is terrible. The opposition is weak and the government is divided between the 'frontbench' politicians who run departments in government and the rest of the party. The means that the only people who don't have any interest in making everything seem terrible is the PM and his most important ministers. Everyone else can benefit hugely from making everyone scared and negative and the frontbench politicians are not trusted so no-one believes them when they say it's all fine. Thus people have been taken in by the negative zeitgeist and are more willing to vote for extreme things. The Olympics was a small positive blip but the fact that we were still in recession at that point put a big dampener on that.

true,Quebe,IREL,Ireland,"Yes in Ireland the voting districts are divided into constituencies of approximately ideally but usually approximately even population centered around communities, there's both local county councils with very limited powers and then MP's (or TD's as we call them) who make up the bulk of decision making.

Currently the Parliament is divided into an upper and lower house but it looks like the Upper house of Senators is about to be abolished in favour of single house in an upcoming referendum.

The Left deemed it as an inherently elitist and undemocratic institution for numerous reasons, for one you must be a graduate of a select amount of Universities in the country to vote for one section of the Senators, an equal amount are elected by a single University (Trinity College), these represent only 10% of the Senators with the rest chosen according to Party representation in the Lower House.

Likewise the concept of an Upper House is criticised as being inherantly undemocratic and Elitist even if it was directly elected to, as the Senators are in theory given longer terms in office so as allow them not to pander to public opinion as MPs must.

The right (consisting of only one of the two largest parties) however wishes to retain the House though agreeing it needs reform. Many see this as centered around power interests on both sides with one of the two largest parties benefiting more from its existence than the other.

Stichwort BTW13: für genau solche Müll-Parteien wie AfD ist diese Hürde gedacht. Was soll so ein politischer Abschaum im Parlament?

Das ist einfach ein ab und zu auftretendes Phänomen, dass halt mal n paar populistische Knallidioten( ob linkspopulistisch, rechtspopulistisch oder marktradikal) so eine Partei wählen.

Dann muss da einfach ne Hürde rein, dass diese Partei nicht in den DB kommt. Solche schädlichen Wählereinflüsse muss ich aus dem Parlament draußen halten. Auch wenn das nicht sehr demokratisch klingen mag, so ist das doch ein  zentraler Aspekt der _repräsentativen_ Demokratie, nämlich Unregelmäßigkeiten abzufangen. Zb wenn eine Partei wegen temporären Umständen, oder Krisen Wählerzulauf gewinnt, obwohl sie doch zb ziemlich unseriös oder populistisch ist. (-&gt;Musterbeispiel AfD)

Und selbst die Runtersetzung auf 3% ist imho eine völlig unnötige Aktion. Stell dir mal vor, es hängt auf einmal an einer 3% Partei, dass sich Koalitionen bilden? Die verkaufen sich auf einmal wie 10%. Und das is jetzt nur ein Beispiel.

Mit AfD und Piraten hätten wir dann schonmal mindestens 2 mehr drin, neben FDP die sowieso wieder in den DB einzieht wenn sie sich endlich mal regelt.

NPD und FW wären dann auch heiße Anwärter, weil die dann potentielle Wähler mobilisieren können, nach dem Motto ""es fehlt nicht mehr viel, die chance ist groß, dass die Stimme nicht verschwendet ist"".

Könnten dann in naher Zukunft theoretisch 4 Parteien mehr sein. (+ cdu, csu, fdp, spd, linke und grüne macht das ganze 10 Parteien im Bundestag)

In general, associating yourself US politics is still a step too far.

Here's what I've found, something about the [RER B](http://parisbytrain.com/charles-de-gaulle-airport-cdg-to-paris-by-train/) that picks up at Charles de Gaulle and runs through several of the metro stops right in the center of Paris.

I didn't get a chance to use the RER myself while I was there, but I hear it's just as nice as the metro.  You have to purchase separate tickets for it though, not metro tickets/passes.  the metro gets you around the city and the RER gets you to the outlying areas like the airport and Versailles and other places.

The problem with this logic, especially in today's world of universal secondary education and widespread tertiary education, is that politicians have been shown to be just as fickle, uneducated and easily manipulated as the Public, more so in many ways in fact.

Likewise the division of powers has been shown to not work well in practice with Party Elites generally having a firm grasp over policy making throughout all houses of government, or worse still parliaments becoming a thug of war with indecision being worse than any particular side (as we're seeing in the US at the moment).

Thus one break away from the Lockean perspective would be to empower the public rather than relying on trusting Representatives who claim to know whats better for us.

Another Modern interpretation of Democracy that breaks away from the Liberal model would be the Stalinist interpretation, though it is rarely taken seriously in the West it bears mentioning as it's still in use in places such as China and Cuba, wherein the concept is that when you have a true group of Politicians who are working for the interest of the public whatever they do is Democratic, elections therefore and unnessecary as are multiple parties as only the party of the People is a true democratic party any opposing parties would be undemocratic and thus should be banned from participating.
