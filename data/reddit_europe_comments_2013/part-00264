Why? Because the idea is an anathema to us. What we might have gained from the euro in terms of economic benefits is vastly, vastly outweighed by the loss of control over our own economy. Again with Schengen whatever benefits there might have been it's not worth giving up control. The control over our own affairs/destiny is worth more to us than any kind of economic benefit we might have received.

So what emptyhunter means I suspect is that the very idea of joining any kind of EU federation is absolutely inconceivable to us, we'd never give up that kind of power in fact we're going in the complete opposite direction, we're actively discussing and planning a referendum on leaving the EU...

true,matude,ESTO,Estland,"&gt; In Estonia, according to statistics from July 1st 2013, there are 1 355 782 inhabitants, 1 235 095 Estonian citizens (of whom 86 767 live abroad). 84,7% of inhabitants are Estonian citizens, **6,65% are without citizenship and 9,05% are foreign citizens** (of whom 6,91% Russian. Others: 5592 Ukrainian, 5195 Finnish, 3020 Latvian, 1873 Lithuanian, 1726 German and 5592 Belarusian). 

So to recap: In Estonia 15,7% of the population can **not vote** on Estonian Parliament elections, but they **can vote** on municipal/local elections if they've been residents for 5+ years. And if they come from a European Union country they can also vote on European Parliament elections.

But the law is nothing unique and the problem isn't with Russian citizenships or voting rights. The issue is that there's so many who haven't taken up *any* citizenship – not Russian, nor Estonian. They don't want the Russian, and they don't bother with the Estonian. Even after 20 years of living in the independent sovereign country. And trust me when I say the tests are already ridiculously easy: you can get through the language tests by barely uttering a few words, and the information you need to know about the country's historical background and laws are about 5-10 pages at most. It has come down to 'do I really need it and does it improve my everyday life?', and in 9 cases out of 10 it doesn't change their lives. Many of these people are already old, they've become lethargic to governmental activities anyway because they've seen all kinds of corrupt administrational shit happen over the last half a century. If the only reason is the ability to vote on Parliamentary elections then it's not incentive enough for many to even fill out the application because many of them live on the countryside anyway, where local elections play a larger role.

Another thing, not all of the people without citizenship are Russian, many of them are also ethnic Estonian. [Latvia and Estonia restored the pre-1940 citizenship laws on the basis of the legal continuity of their statehood throughout 1940 – 1991, automatically recognizing citizenship for the persons who held citizenship before 16 June 1940 and their descendants. This policy affected not only ethnic Russians, but also the descendants of those ethnic Estonians and Latvians who emigrated from these countries before independence was proclaimed in 1918.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians_in_the_Baltic_states)  
My grandfather is one of them, ethnic Estonian, speaks perfect, can trace our Estonian lineage back to about 1600s – didn't have Estonian passport until it was given to him by the president on special orders for significant military contributions (he was a high ranking officer). Why? Because he wasn't bothered to go through the process for almost 20 years. 

Personally I feel like it's the surest sign that life is okay in Estonia for these people, in fact it's so okay that the citizenship makes a little difference, especially for older folk.

You can apply directly to universities but would have to take a French test (minimum B2 usually), get everything translated by a state-certified translator (in France, which is already expensive, so having that qualification in the US would be even more expensive I'd wager), then send it in by April usually, wait around until June-July to hear back, then get an appointment with your local French consulate to get your visa and plane ticket.

All things considered it would be cheaper than going to a US university for one year, but the barrier to entry is higher, more difficult, and more stressful for you.

&gt; Two football players (soccer for y'all) are talking:

&gt; Who are the most cultured audience in the world?

&gt; The Scottish.

&gt; A Jewish kid attends to a Catholic school. The teacher says: ""I give 1000 forints (~€3.3 or so) if you tell me who was the greatest man in the world.""

&gt; One kid says: Leonardo da Vinci

&gt; Teacher: well, he was a great man but I didn't think of him, sorry.

&gt; Another says: Einstein

&gt; Teacher: better, but still not him.

&gt; Jewish kid says: Jesus

&gt; Teacher: good, here's the 1000. But you're Jewish, shouldn't you have said Moses?

&gt; Jewish kid: Well, Moses is Moses, but business is business...

Le moins de 1% de mineurs aujourd'hui effectue le travail que 100 fois plus fesaient avant. Un mineur GPU à portée de tout le monde, en dehors des couts en électricité qui le rendent plus cher à faire tourner que ce qu'il rapporte en BTC, sort peut-être 5 Mhash/s. Compare ça à un ASIC de base qui envoie facilement 60GH.

Le minage pour tous ne résoudrai pas le problème. Qu'un mec envoie 60GH ou que 10 000 mecs envoient 6MH ne change pas le problème que quand il n'y aura plus de bitcoins à miner, plus personne ne claquera des centaines de milliers de dollars dans du matos et l'électricité pour le faire tourner.

Plus de vérifications, plus de BTC.

2) La déflation c'est mal. Cela bloque l'investissement. Pourquoi dépenser 1 BTC maintenant quand je pourrai avoir plus avec ce même BTC demain? Les periodes déflationnistes dans l'histoire se sont toutes soldées par des récessions ou presque.

Pendant une déflation, même un prêt à taux 0 est peu attractif, parce que tu devra rendre l'argent avec une monnaie qui vaut plus que ce à quoi tu l'a empruntée. Aux USA pendant la grande dépression la déflation à atteint plus de 10%. C'est comme si tu empruntait de l'argent a 10% minimum.

En gros, si toutes les économies du monde se battent pour éviter la déflation, c'est pour de bonnes raisons. L'inflation à aussi son lot de problèmes, mais bien moins graves, surtout à des taux réduits de l'ordre de 2-3%

Ach wirklich? Ich dachte die Piratenpartei wäre grade wegen ihrer kaputten Persönlichkeiten gescheitert. Frag mal die Leute auf der Strasse.

true,Toxirine,SWED,Sweden/Finland,"Two Norwegians were driving during the night when the driver begins to worry that something is wrong with his blinkers. He asks his friend to go out and check on them. His friend agrees and as soon as they pulled over, he walks out and walks over to look at them.
""Its working!.. Not working.. Working!.. Not working.. Working!.. Not working..""

Same two Norwegians were driving a lorry which was about 2½ meters tall. As they drive they are faced with a tunnel, on which it says ""Max Height, two meters."" The two men look at each other, and one asks to the other; ""Do you see any policemen?"" The second shakes his head. ""Then let's go!""

A Swede and a Norwegian ends up in a traffic collision. It is clearly the Norwegain's fault and the Swede walks out of his car absolutely furious. Even more so when I realise that while his car is quite banged up, the Norwegians car managed to survive without any real damages. ""Look what you have done! My car is ruined!"" yells the Swede at the Norwegian, who now exits his car. The Norwegian looks at the two cars. ""Well at least mine made it."" 
This is too much for the Swede to take, and he picks up a heavy metal piece that once was connected to his car, and draws a circle around the Norwegian. ""You will stay in the circle, or I will beat you senseless. Do you understand?"" The Norwegian says he understands, after which the Swede begins to bash the Norwegian's car with the metal piece. After a few hits he looks to the Norwegian and yells, ""Do you see what I am doing with your car!?"" The Norwegian smiles and nods. ""Yes I see.""
The Swede, Puzzled by the smile, continues to bash at the mans car, and soon looks to him again. This time the Norwegian is laughing. ""Do you see what I am doing to your vehicle!?"" The Norwegian nods. ""Yes I see!""
He continues to bash at the car, only to be halted by the Norwegians laughing. He turns to him, confused, and asks ""I am destroying your car, why are you laughing!?""
The Norwegian wipes his eyes. ""Yes, I see that you are destroying your car, but while you did that, I left the circle **three** times!""",0,1386412795,null,0,1386471475,0,cdvrkip,t3_1sa8b5,t1_cdvrkip,t3_1sa8b5,null,1428355877,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt; Ich dachte die Piratenpartei wäre grade wegen ihrer kaputten Persönlichkeiten gescheitert. Frag mal die Leute auf der Strasse.

Richtiger Ansatz, falsche Schlussfolgerung, Denn: wären tolle Persönlichkeiten wie Weisband o.ä. geblieben, dann wär die öffentliche Wahrnehmung auch besser. Die Leute springen leichter auf Themen an, wenn ein kompetenter und charismatischer Politiker sie Ihnen näher bringt, als wenn ich da nen Haufen ""Spinner"" hab. die aus der Reihe scheren (-&gt;öfftl. Wahrnehmung). Jetzt hatten se nur noch die Knallidioten, Machtgeilheit wurde mehrmals versch. Leuten attestiert usw.

Die plakativen und seriösen haben se vergrault weil se Politikern nix bezahlen wollen. Was soll die Scheiße?? Wenn ich mich mit allem Reinhänge is Politiker mehr als ein Ganztagsjob.

&gt;Du meinst also, das nicht gewählte Gremium soll ein Thema vorantreiben welches keinen Rückhalt in der Bevölkerung hat und das am besten mit einem kräftigen Hauch ""Persönlichkeit""? Alleine das finde ich hier bedenklich. Was ist den das für ein Umgang mit den Leuten? Warum kann den dieses Gremium den Leuten das nicht mit Vernunft und ausnahmsweise einfach mal mit ""wirklich Erklären"" verkaufen? Weil es vielleicht stinkt wie der Fisch von gestern und wir deswegen jemanden mit ""Persönlichkeit"" brauchen um den Gestank zu überdecken? Vielleicht sogar so gut überdecken, dass das nun stärkere Kontrollorgan auch drauf reinfällt? Meine Fresse muss das eine Perrrrsönlichkeit sein....

&gt;keinen Rückhalt in der Bevölkerung

Dann würd ich mir nochmal angucken wie die Kommissare ernannt werden, wirklich undemokratisch ist das auch nicht. Nur eben keine direkte Wahl.

&gt;Persönlichkeit

Wo isn bitte das Problem, wenn ich sag ""die Inhalte der Spd sind geil und Steinbrück is auch einfach n Geiler"". Das is dann einfach eine Persönlichkeit die bestimmte Atribute besitzt, komm mal bitte von diesem Basisdemokratischen Irrsinn weg. Eine Persönlichkeit die Ideen an den Mann bringt und *real*politische Erfahrung hat muss -bei aller Demokratie- auch mit am Start sein. Wir haben schließlich eine verkackte **repräsentative** Demokratie und *keine* Basisdemokratie. 

Und das ist auch gut so, das Volk ist eben auch eine Gewalt die man im politischen System begrenzen muss. Das is leider (noch) so. Vielleicht ändert sich das ja irgendwann, wenn die Leute endlich richtig mündig werden, das ist aber noch sehr ferne Zukunftsmusik atm.

&gt;Weil es vielleicht stinkt wie der Fisch von gestern und wir deswegen jemanden mit ""Persönlichkeit"" brauchen um den Gestank zu überdecken? Vielleicht sogar so gut überdecken, dass das nun stärkere Kontrollorgan auch drauf reinfällt? Meine Fresse muss das eine Perrrrsönlichkeit sein....

Als ob da jetzt nur Scheiße laufen würde in der Kommission. Der einzige Fehler der gemacht wurde, is der dass das Parlament keine Gesetzesinitiative hat und den Lobbyistenfuzzis in der Kommission Tür und Tor offen steht.

Aber auch wenn wirtschaftliche Interessen teilweise über den Volkswillen gestellt wurden (Andere Themenfelder dagegen nciht unbedingt negativ beeinflusst wurden): Wo kann die Kommission denn den europäischen Gedanken nicht stärker vorantreiben?

Außerdem musst du bedenken, dass bei einer Stärkung des Parlaments das Gesetzgebungsmonopol der Kommission sowieso gebrochen ist.

Der nächste Punkt wäre der, dass die Kommission ja im Prinzip als Exekutive -als Regierung- fungieren sollte. Sagen wir also, Schmidts ""persönlichkeit"" wäre als öffentlichkeitswirksamen Gesicht (zb über verbreitung in Medien) praktisch der Bundespräsident der EU. Keine tatsächliche Macht, aber er gibt dem ganzen ein Gesicht.

Und er könnte über seine Popularität die Geschicke der EU verbessern, indem er dem ganzen ein Gesicht gibt und die Voklsnähe verbessert.


Fazit: Wo hast du das Problem, ""Persönlichkeit"" direkt mit ""Führerr"" zu asozieren? Ist Gauck ein ""Führerr""? Oder Merkel? Oder Steinbrück? Nooope.

A new teacher arrives to the primary school in [majority ethnic Hungarian region in Slovakia] Felvidék and introduces herself to the class, explaining she is Slovak. She asks the class in Slovak who else is a Slovak. The kids don't understand what she says, but play along and raise their hands, all but one. She asks the one student who didn't raise her arm why didn't she. 

""Because I'm not a Slovak"" - she answers. 

The teacher gets confused and asks why does she consider herself Hungarian. 

""My mother is Hungarian, my father is Hungarian, so I am, too, a Hungarian"". 

The teacher gets angry and snaps back 

""If your mother would be a shithead, your father would be a shithead, would that make you a shithead as well?""

Also, the problem with ageing population is that a declining number of working people and an increasing number of people on support will strain the budgets. Middle Eastern refugees and the 2nd and 3rd generations have quite low rates of employment, which only increases this problem.

The US is home to a lot of migrants from Latin America, just as Western Europe is home to a lot of migrants from Eastern Europe. This is completely different from the influx of refugees, as these migrants have a similar cultural and religious background (so they integrate easily), and a high rate of employment.

A Romanian village is invaded by locusts. The mayor goes to a witch in the forest. She gives him a tiny blue locust and instructs him to place it in the middle of the village. He does so, and suddenly all locusts in the village gather around the tiny blue locust, only to fly away together, far away from the village. Years later, the same village is invaded by stray dogs.

He places it in the middle of the village, and all dogs promptly queue up behind the tiny blue one and leave the village. That same night, the mayor goes knocking at the witch's hut.

Si assicura governabilità, parola fondamentale nel 2013 quando gran parte delle repubbliche parlamentari europee arranca nel garantire stabilità di governo e il ricorso alle larghe intese è via via sempre maggiore.

Inoltre il cittadino nel collegio di residenza può scegliere il proprio parlamentare preferito. Con questo meccanismo assicuri: che il cittadino effettivamente scelga il proprio parlamentare (e questo senza neanche le preferenze), chi prende maggioranza anche relativa in un collegio va in parlamento, che il parlamentare conservi un legame con il territorio di provenienza (maggiore controllo sull'operato!), che si guardi non tanto alla casacca del partito, ma alla personalità e validità del singolo candidato che farebbe chiaramente campagna sul territorio.

Un sistema del genere - maggioritario - e riforma in senso presidenziale assicurerebbe governabilità e stabilità al nostro paese, e soprattutto chi è al governo governerebbe sul serio, con maggiore capacità decisionale e con un'elevata appropriabilità dei risultati, positivi e negativi che siano.

true,shirogr,null,null,"&gt;Where do these cheaper goods come from? Romania? Bulgaria? Why are other high GDP euro-zone countries not affected in this way?

Many of the goods come from these countries, but others come from countries like Germany, France and Holland. As to why other high-GDP euro-zone countries were not affected like that, its because they had a stronger industrial bases or they were already export-oriented economics. So when the tariffs came down, their goods were cheaper than our domestic ones and totally displaced them from our market.

&gt;Was your agricultural production ""destroyed""?

Before, the Euro, in any supermarket, most of the groceries would be Greek. Now they are imported. But this is anecdotal evidence. According to Eurostat, the output of the agricultural industry fell from 11,5billion in 2002 to 10,7bil in 2012 (-7%) and crop output from 8,1bil in 2002 to 6,7bil in 2012 (-18%). Not only that, but agricultural income fell from 107% in 2004 to 74% in 2013 (using 2005 level as a standard). ([link1](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tag00054&amp;plugin=1) / [link2](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tag00102&amp;plugin=1) / [link3](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do))

&gt;""As a result of the country's entry to the European Community, much of its agricultural infrastructure has been upgraded and agricultural output increased. Between 2000 and 2007 organic farming in Greece increased by 885%, the highest change percentage in the EU""

This means nothing. In 2000, organic farming had a cultivated area of 700ha. In 2007 it had 280.000ha. To compare, the total cultivated area in Greece is 3.460.000ha. That means that as a percentage, in 2007, organic farming accounted for a measly 8% of the cultivated area, the 885% that you mention. Big whoop. Even that though, does not tells us something about the income of the farmer or the state of the agricultural industry.

&gt; Currently exports are fluctuating around an all-time high. Is there some negative reality behind this figure?

Unfortunately I can only offer anecdotal evidence for this, so feel free to disregard it, but the rise in the graph that you can see during 2010 to now in your source, is attributed to the stripping of the greek industrial sector and the selling of back stock and equipment etc. In the agricultural sector, most of it comes from notorious farms (search Manolada [link](http://www.newstatesman.com/austerity-and-its-discontents/2013/04/greeces-modern-slavery-lessons-manolada)) that use immigrants as slaves. Anyway, during all this time, this increase did not translate into increased income for the average worker. Also, during this whole time, the trade deficit increased and only slows down now, since people do not have money to buy things any more so less imports ([link](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/balance-of-trade)).

&gt;This did not begin to occur until the 2008 crisis, and has begun to decrease from the peak in 2012.

I disagree. In 2002 the debt was 159.2bil (102% of GDP) and in 2012 it is 303.9bil (156.9% of GDP), featuring a year on year increase in absolute numbers ([link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis#Unsustainable_and_accelerating_debt-to-GDP_ratios)",0,1386425029,null,0,false,0,cdvtagy,t3_1s5met,t1_cdvtagy,t1_cdv23s5,null,1428355074,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Aside from being against nuclear power within the EU, one of the policies of the European Greens is to remove funding for ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. This is a project in scope along the lines of the Large Hadron Collider, the thing is supposed to cost about 15-20 billion euros and is going to be probably *the* single most advanced fusion (ha) of science and engineering currently on the planet.

true,ILikeMoneyToo,CROA,Croatia,"I was just responding to what I perceive as support for the PM saying that, whatever people say, the referendum won't be held, without asking the Constitutional Court for its opinion. Anyways, my point was that there are rights, and then there are ""rights"". By ""rights"" I mean something that seems reasonable to most of us and is often implemented, but doesn't nearly fall into the same category as such rights to life, basic living conditions, a fair judicial system, speech, education, etc.

As for your second paragraph here, well fine. If the Constitutional Court interprets that as grounds to stop this referendum, then I have no complaints. 

By the way, as a total amateur, it seems to me that that article guarantees people those three things in ""regular"" life, and not in an official capacity. As in, we won't stop you from organizing whatever culture groups, the use of whatever language/script while talking with family, friends, or even have a private TV channel where you speak whatever you want. But it's not the same thing to enforce official use of such a language.

If that were true, we'd have to use ALL minority languages in an official capacity. Not using Serbian(or whatever else language) officially as a rule(I don't mind residents of a city to decide on their own in a democratic fashion) isn't the same as forbidding people to identify as another nationality, freedom to use their language/script in their personal life all they want, or pursue whatever cultural projects they want(and even get state funding for it, as they too, pay taxes just like all of us).

true,ILikeMoneyToo,CROA,Croatia,"First of all, gay people never had the right to gay marriage in Croatia. That stipulation about marriage was already a part of ""regular"" law, and the referendum was about copy pasting it into the Constitution. It wasn't a revocation of rights, but rather an effort to maintain the status quo. Also, it isn't a human right(according to the European Court for Human Rights).

By the way, that referendum would not have been held had it been deemed unconstitutional. Therefore, the Constitution cannot be unconditionally changed. It can be merely built upon. At least that's how it seems to me.

Anways, well, what do you propose then? How do you ensure that some basic rights can never be violated, without literally telling the populace of a country that they're not allowed a vote on something. 

Frankly, I believe that this kind of matter can be simply dealt with by having articles in the Constitution that forbid trampling on human rights as accepted in the international community. I seriously don't believe the majority of people would ever vote to suspend human rights, and if such a situation ever occurred, I already believe we'd be royally fucked.
I think a greater danger lies in limitations on the power of democratic implements such as referenda, which allow a populace to take control in certain matters when politicians who've been elected to act in the spirit of the people who elected them go back on their word.

Democratic tradition and the power of the people to decide on matters of common interest is more important to me than the risk of those people sometimes going astray. I'd rather it take 10-15 more years for gay people to be more accepted in society(which is a process continuously happening in the right direction in this country), than risk becoming a Ukraine or Turkey where the police will beat the shit out of me because we the people don't agree with the current political establishment.

Frankly, the thing I fear the most in the future is an undemocratic dystopia. Maybe I watch too many movies, but this is my opinion.

By the way, you're from a country with a strong democratic tradition and, frankly, don't really need to fear any rogue government or whatever. The Croatian people have been under one boot or another for approximately a thousand years, and are not really used to democracy all that much. I think that developing a sense of legitimate representation is the greatest priority right now. We're actually pretty ok on social issues, and can really only get better. But the political system here is beyond screwed up, and that isn't something that can be fixed with the passage of time alone.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There's three different types of rights. Fundamental (such as right to life) , political (such as freedom to protest) and social (such as the right to education). 

Fundamental and political are what you're thinking of when referring to rights, but the social rights are not exactly as enforceable. They just represent a general direction that a country should follow, with no specific case by case requirement. 

The article states that : The Committee is proposing that minority language rights should be granted only in places where at least half of population is from an ethnic minority, instead of a third, as under the current minority rights legislation.

At least half of the population implies that they are not even a minority right,they are the majority. Therefore, by your logic that we should not grant minority languages official status then we'd have to see the other language as being the majority and most used language and then croatian would have to be the language that gets removed from sings on the street, and the other language that is in majority becomes the one used in that city. This is according to your interpretation of the article in the constitution as they are free to decide in a democratic fashion.You can't stop them from doing this. Right?

If you grant official capacity to minority languages (you don't have to do it for all, you can set a 5% threshold, as I think most countries do) then both languages would be used side by side and no one is upset, and it stops being a conflict.

That's the interpretation on that article that most countries have.The interpretation on legal articles is done within a legal context(both national and international). It's most often useful to see how the same articles have been applied within other countries. That's what i did and said that it does infringe on those people's rights.


For example :  Finland recognizes swedish as an official language. Belgium and Switzerland have a specific case as well. 

The most similar case that I'm familar with is Netherlands recognizes Frisian in Friesland and even allows students to learn that language in schools if they so wish. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisian_languages)

true,ILikeMoneyToo,CROA,Croatia,"Alright, thanks for the clarification.

The only thing I'd like to say further about social rights is that they need to evolve through education and dialogue. 

I look at it like this. I want society to be more liberal. There are ""conservative"" extremists who'll basically never be convinced. There are also moderates who are repelled by aggressive labeling of conservatives, media wars, and politicians telling large parts of the populace to go fuck themselves because they're backwards and narrow-minded. This simply isn't the way to go. You can't change people's minds over night, especially on matters they're really not remotely interested in changing. 

What -would- work on such people are proper arguments(of which there are many) on why people should let laws dictate the most important of things(those which can directly harm people), and leave each other be in others matters. And, what would work on the children of the extremists is education on tolerance(note that I'm saying tolerance, and *not* education on Thinking the Things We Think Are Right).

Once a society has in its collective consciousness that people have a right to be different in all matters but those which step on the rights of others, then acceptance(which is far better than tolerance) can occur naturally. Trying to force acceptance aggressively can only polarize people and make change for the better more difficult.

TL;DR
You can't force things. It only leads to further backlash. Rather, educate and promote tolerance and good things come naturally.

-----------------------------------

In regards to your edit, it's half of the population of a city or something, but not half the population of a country(that kind of threshold, I agree, would be very unreasonable).

Anyways, I don't know. I guess there might be mostly emotional reasons behind my thinking, but I simply don't see why use of minority languages in official institutions is a necessity. I mean, I don't mind, but I still don't see it as necessary. 

Also, considering the quite extraordinary circumstances of Vukovar(read up on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vukovar#Croatian_War_of_Independence), which is basically the whole reason why this referendum is even wanted, really, I don't think the situation with Frisian in the Netherlands is quite the same.
I have nothing against Serbian people in general, but I do understand the emotionality of the situation. Do take into consideration that a part of the Serbian population of Vukovar were members of the force which took part in the horrific siege of the city which claimed a lot of Vukovaran family members' lives, and that, for them, the cyrillic alphabet is a symbol of that.

true,FrisianDude,FRIE,Friesland,"&gt;    - Gallic Wars
    - Lost. In a war whose ending foreshadows the next 2000 years of French history, France is conquered by of all things, an Italian. [Or at ths time in history, a Roman -ed.]

Not only is 'Gallic' not French, it seems ludicrous to argue that the Gauls are particularly bad at fighting because they lost to *Rome* what with Rome being the main power in Europe for a very long while, having defeated opponents more unified than all the separate little Gallic tribes who could often be taken piecemeal, and when a confederacy (like Vercingetorix' Arverni) couldn't be defeated bit by bit they provided quite a struggle for Rome; indeed at V's last stand (Alesia) Rome had not only Roman troops (haha italians can't fight olol) but also Germanic and Celtic ones on their own side, as well as one of the most reknown commanders in European history whereas the Arverni (with their allies) had been beaten quite a bunch of times already by a unified and driven military machine the likes of which had never been in that part of Europe before. Saying the French are sissies because Rome won its Gallic wars is similar to calling the Afghani's sissies for losing against America. A unified high technology and well lead military juggernaut is quite likely to defeat multiple smaller factions at odds with each other with worse equipement, any day of the week. 

&gt;- Hundred Years War
- Mostly lost, saved at last by female schizophrenic who inadvertently creates The First Rule of French Warfare; ""France's armies are victorious only when not led by a Frenchman."" Sainted.

Rather typical Anglo-penis-waving rather than an attempt to actually encapsulate the conflict, and then boiling down a defeat to a 'a female schizophrenic'. A rather odd choice given that the English leadership was rather good yet still lost. Would make more sense for people perpetuating this drivel to actually acknowledge the competence of their opponents. Let's face it; mostly lost? Won entirely. What does England still have that it had at the start of the 100-yrs war? Jersey and Guernsey. Mostly because no-one could rightly be bothered to actually go there and take it back. Fine that the English won Crécy and Agincourt, but winning two battles is not winning a war. And medieval wars, like so many, were won by taking holdings, not exhausting and damaging both armies in set battles.  Despite the English Gascon and Bourgondian allies (as well as Normans and Bretons) of course the French crown won this war squarely. 


And frankly, I don't know the others well enough, so I won't comment save:

&gt;- The Dutch War

Wherein the author conveniently forgets that it wasn't a French v Dutch war, it was a France + Munster + Cologne + Sweden + England war against the Netherlands (which later got Habsburg and Brandenburg support). Mind you, this war caused some 'interesting' upheaval in Internal Dutch politics; the raadspensionaris was murdered by a mob because he never expected the French and the English to cooperate against the NL, assuming it would be one or the other, with the non-attacking party eager to support the Netherlands to prevent it becoming an outpost for the attacking party.

First of all, you can find pretty much every family type you want. Some are close, some don't say a word to each other, some just yell and can't leave together ... In general I'd say that we love our family and doing stuff together but we're not THAT close, prefering speaking to my friends than my family when I have a problem(speaking for myself here).

The majority of french people are open-minded, you can marry pretty much everyone you want! However, as Chrissoubibi said, it can be hard for muslim man because french don't want their daughters to be brought back into middle ages, wearing niqab and not being able to leave their life as they wish. (This is a common cliché you can find here). But, basically you won't be forbidden to do so by the society. You do whatever you want and others just have to shut their mouths.

Concerning eating, for me it's usually a sandwich with a fruit for lunch when I'm working and for dinner meat with vegetables/pasta/rice, usually followed by cheese w/ bread and a yoghurt.

France is a great place to live in general, just don't watch the news at 8pm and you'll love living here ;)

Note bien qu'il s'agit pour l'instant d'intention. 

Mais c'est assez raccord avec des clauses semblables dans **l'accord de libre-échange Europe-Canada** signé récemment.

Personne d'autre que nos chers gouvernements et la Commission n'a eu accès au texte pour vérifier les termes exacts de l'accord. La Commission Européenne refuse de faire circuler le document de travail  jusqu'à la traduction définitive du document soumis en signature aux Etats membres mais le point de contentieux principal est bien la possibilité de recours ouverte aux multinationales contre la législation d'un Etat signataire.


[Bruxelles a communiqué sur les grands termes de l'accord](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-911_fr.htm) mais n'a rien dit de la façon dont les investisseurs pourront requérir contre les Etats de la CE. ""Le renforcement des obligations en matière de protection de l'investissement sera fondé sur un mécanisme moderne et efficace de règlement des litiges entre les investisseurs et l'État."" Ahem.

ATTAC est particulièrement remonté contre cet accord, parce que la Commission n'a pour l'instant pas donné de gages suffisants que l'ouverture des importations alimentaires se fasse dans le respect des normes CE, mais aussi à cause de ce mécanisme de règlement des différends « État-investisseur ».

&gt; Ce type de mécanisme, dit de « protection des investissements », ouvre le droit à une entreprise de poursuivre un État ou une instance infra-étatique si une réglementation la prive de bénéfices escomptés ; le différend sera arbitré par un panel d'experts privés, de façon discrétionnaire et en dehors des juridictions publiques nationales, régionales ou multilatérales.

&gt; Pour Fanny Simon de l'Aitec, « un tel dispositif menace les pouvoirs de régulations des autorités élues, remet en cause la souveraineté des populations et mine leurs droits et libertés démocratiques en donnant le pouvoir aux entreprises multinationales de contester des dispositions réglementaires prises pour protéger l'environnement, les petits paysans, les PME ou encore la santé publique. C'est d'autant plus inacceptable qu'une telle mesure n'influera pas, ou à la marge, les flux d'investissement déjà très importants entre les deux pays, preuve de la confiance des investisseurs dans le cadre juridique en place ». 

Il est à noter que le Canada est déjà aux prises des recours de ce type :
&gt; Or, les entreprises recourent de plus en plus souvent à ce type de dispositif pour contester des décisions publiques qu'elles jugent contraires à leurs intérêts . L'entreprise américaine Lone Pine vient ainsi de déposer plainte contre le gouvernement québécois et lui réclame $250 millions de compensation pour l'instauration d'un moratoire interdisant l'utilisation de la fracturation hydraulique dans la vallée du Saint-Laurent.

This post, in particular the choice of a [picture for representing life in Vilnius](http://i.imgur.com/J3rH6aC.jpg), has attracted some attention from Lithuanian media and has caused a slight stir on Facebook.

Anyway, it's an interesting, albeit peculiar gallery. Please enjoy.

EDIT: Since this post is getting traction, I'm adding translation for dramatic introductory text from the [original source](http://bigpicture.ru/?p=402019). No more information is provided, not even the name of the photographer.

&gt; All pictures taken during one year of travel around former Soviet republics. Efforts in defining national identity of newly found states after the collapse of the communist empire can be seen in the pictures. A land of contrasts, full of wealth and poverty. Rapid development of cities sharply contrasts with deprivation of surrounding neighbourhoods. Gold plated images of new dictators in the background of fading power.

* * *

EDIT 2: So, I got an idea of running a reverse image search, and it paid off! Pictures are from a book *Red Journey* by Belgian photographer Nick Hannes. Taken in 2008... There are many more pictures from the series on photographer's website. No direct link, since it's an old flash website: http://www.nickhannes.be/flash.html &gt; Red Journey &gt; View Album.

I don't think the reason extremist groups are less political in America has anyhting to do with how accepted it is. I hear extremist anti-islam crap from Americans all the time, both by everyday people and important politicans. The reason is more likely because du the size of America (+300 millon) it creates a lot of different groups who all have extremist views regarding entirily different things which creates a landscape where many of these don't wish to merge because of how different they are. Then there's also the fact that it's pretty hard to actually aquire anything but regional power in the US as a third party.

&gt; It does not have to be this way. The euro can be saved, but it will take more than fine speeches asserting a commitment to Europe. If Germany and others are not willing to do what it takes – if there is not enough solidarity to make the politics work – then the euro may have to be abandoned for the sake of salvaging the European project.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"Now for a completely and totally different perspective:

Croatian dual citizen here living in Croatia. The history of the area, and the breakup of Yugoslavia and all of that is interesting, but it's irrelevant to the subject at hand. We live in the 21st century and Croatia is now a member of the European Union. Clinging onto past paradigms does **no one** any favours - not here, not in Bosnia, not in Serbia. 

Croatians voted in favour of EU membership. We *knew*, signing up to that, that Croatia would have to respect European law, adapt reforms that stamped out corruption, respected a broader definition of human rights, and went some way towards cutting down on the insane levels of bureaucracy that exist here. Slowly but surely, these things are happening.

However, what I can't abide is turning a dislike of homophobia into some anti-Balkan crusade based on a lack of historical understanding. Yes, Croatia is a devoutly Catholic country and sometimes I wonder if the real power brokers are in Zagreb or in the Holy See. That being said, this is also irrelevant - Croatia is a secular democracy, and as such it must **respect minority rights without regard to religious texts**. And there is NO way that you can argue that the constitutional amendment *wasn't* religious in nature, because it damn well was and everyone knows it.

Frankly, I'd rather the rest of Europe be disappointed in Croatia not for having passed this ridiculous, useless and utterly unwarranted amendment not because they're homophobic, but that the Croatian people are so short-sighted that they genuinely believe that holding referenda to enshrine Biblical scripture into a secular constitution is something that's acceptable. It isn't. 

I frankly don't give two shits whether or not someone is for or against same-sex marriage, or what their beliefs are, even though I think it's not only a misguided viewpoint but a hurtful one - I can't imagine the feeling of waking up every morning deciding to randomly dislike an entire section of your countrymen just because you feel like you should. And Croatians should know better - the reason why sections of this country still lie in bombed-out ruins is **because of the exact same us-versus-them sentiment**. Not only that, but I invite judgement on this amendment both from within and outside Croatia because it's the only thing that will change the status quo. People with religious beliefs are entitled to them (although I resent and will continue to campaign against those beliefs that teach hatred of others for no reason other than 'that dude told us to'). But I won't stand by as a secular country gets its laws hijacked by the church, and starts to pass laws that **restrict the freedom of others to live their lives with no negative consequences on anyone else**. If people are up in arms because their right to discriminate via referendum might go away soon, then fuck them. Let them lose. Let Europe pour its scorn upon those people here and everywhere else in Europe who seek to limit the rights of others based on 'personal beliefs'. The sort of thinking that led to this referendum caused tremendous heartache throughout the Balkans 20 years ago, and has no place in a civilised society, here or elsewhere, and we *all* must work to rid Europe of hatred and intolerance.

true,HugodeCrevellier,Normandie,Normandie,"&gt;*...if someone who isn't french wanted to marry your son/daughter, would they allow it?*

It depends on how much ""*not-French*"" we are talking about. Like what, a onle legged sociopathic Muslim pygmy homosexual Nazi sadomasochistic slaughterhouse butcher with Tourette syndrome that can only communicate by scatological bursts  in upper Swahili for example? I guess that it would depend  on the family.

&gt;*What do the french eat in a typical day?*

Our typical breakfast consists of a light anchovy and raspberry marmalade omelette, perhaps with a side order of frog eyes and duck teeth pâté. This would be accompanied by some coffee and Calvados brandy. Incidentally, we like our coffee somewhat strong. Though you should have enough time to drink it before it dissolves its porcelain container.

For lunch , given the state of the economy, dirt is the preferred meal maybe with some mud, also some garden-slugs (on holidays if we are lucky).  When time is a factor intravenous nicotine is also popular.  

For dinner, the typical French family may consume some monkey lighlty marinated in a cheese and Gauloise sauce, the whole served in a preheated beret and accompanied by a nice Beaujolais nouveau, depending on the season. 

&gt;*What's it like in france?*

It was reported (but not confirmed by any English-language publication) that a French woman did crack a smile in 1979. Other than that, it's an unending valley of despair, where the most common subjects of discussion are the brilliance of US foreign policy, the excellence of British cooking, the reliability of Italian engineering, the German  sense of humour and the decline of France ... and of course the best methods of committing suicide. 

&gt;*How far are the schools from your home*

By Napoleonic law all schools have been established at a distance of exactly 7593 metric meters from any household. An amendment by the racist Front National party would extend this to 7593,5 for immigrant households. Due to left-wing opposition and protests by the unions however, schools are expected to remain closed for the next couple of centuries.

&gt;*, etc.*

I think that the people are not so much manipulated by the church as much they define it.

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"Honestly in my experience there aren't that many differences between denizens of 1st world/western countries. Most of the answers I could give you as a native Frenchman are probably quite similar to your own experiences as an American. Some families are more accepting than others, some more tightly-knit than others etc.



The only things I can think of that would stand apart between a typical French family and a typical American one are:

- I hear a lot of things about some US Southerners brawling during family holidays. That being said I don't how prevalent it is across the Atlantic, but if it happened in France it would be the sign of an extremely dysfunctional family and would probably result in CPS being called at some point if there are children in the household.

- Arguing about politics during holiday meals with the in-laws and extended family is an inescapable fact of life in most families. I know that in my family by the time we've killed a few bottles of wine there will have been at least one heated argument or two about current events. Those arguments are as heated as they are ephemeral, they are often quickly forgotten and devoid of consequences.

- Acceptance of foreigners varies a lot. As others have hinted, as long as you're not seriously dating a practicing Muslim you'll probably be okay in most families. You don't necessarily have to be French, but the whiter you are and/or the most westernized you are, the easier it will be. I'm not condoning any sort of xenophobia, just describing how it generally is.

- Fixed meal times is a time-honored French tradition. Few of us eat high-quality food and fancy meals every day or so, but most of us gather together to dine. Dinner would typically take place between 7 to 9 pm. 

- Breakfasts are light (when not skipped altogether) and lunches are taken quite seriously: lunch breaks tend to last at least one hour and a half in French companies and it would be considered pretty normal to eat out (grab a burger, a kebab, or the very popular [jambon-beurre](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambon-beurre) if you work away from home).",0,1386440464,null,0,1386440927,0,cdvy3dj,t3_1sbfmg,t1_cdvy3dj,t3_1sbfmg,null,1428352811,5,false,france,t5_2qhjz,5

Dunque, una volta pubblicata la sentenza, essendo la legge illegittima, non si può applicare».

true,zubapo,null,null,"Hello, I'm french but I've been living in the Southeast US for 5 years now, so that's mostly where my comparison are coming from.

Family life:
In the US I've seen everything from adult friends of mine who hand out with their sisters every other day and go spend the night at their parents, to people who don't go home for the holidays even though they're 2 hours away. In France I feel like it's more in the middle, not going home for the holidays would never occur to me, and I would never miss a birthday if I could help it, but I wouldn't really go see my family if I didn't have a reason to (not having seen them in a long time can be a reason)

Being accepting of other people:
Remember I live in the southeast so it's not the most accepting place as far as people who are different than you are concern. I feel like France is a little more accepting and tolerant of differences and outlier. If you bring someone in your family that you parents don't like, they will still make an effort to be courteous and accept them as part of the family. The first time I met my father in law he told me ""without us we'd be speaking german by now!"", I don't think I would have heard the opposite in my family. 
But as far as everyday hospitality, US is a lot more open!

Food:
I was lucky to be raised by a mom who cooked every day all meals. I never once ate frozen food, or had take-out (which wasn't very common at the time anyway). I think most families were like this to an extent. But it's also not what american expect: most days it's only one meal with no appetizer and only a yogurt as a desert. Common things are beef patties with peas, chicken breast with mashed potatoes, or salmon with green beans, nothing fancy and very little casseroles or fancy meals. The weekend meals would be a little fancier with sauce meals.

For me the main difference between US and French culture is people's way of seeing things. US doesn't have it any better than france right now and yet everybody's always cheerful and sees the best of things, whereas I feel like French are always pesimistic. (This may be accentued by the fact that I live in the South). Oh and religion, here every one is religious or has an opinion about not being religious. Most people in France will tell you they are catholic, but you would be hard pressed to find one that has been in church since the last christmas mass or more. The idea that there is a church community also doesn't exist.

In that regard, a person even stating on video that he is aware of breaking conventions (and ""ordering"" to keep it off the log) might not qualify for the (reasonable) assertion of stress having caused a blackout.

I don't expect low stress levels in combat situations and in the aftermath of those. I also don't believe that a human, emotional, being is able to perform 100% objectively at all times. I don't even think that the court applies that viewpoint but with sentencing misbehaviour (which it is, undoubtedly) you are making clear that certain things can happen, but are not justifiable.

Now I know that modern elements of supporting soldiers in the battlefield also feature psychologists. And their influence should lead to an environment where certain safeguards make sure to never reach the lets say ""revenge"" status. This process, in that case, has failed and begs the question on how it could be improved. I don't know the exact background on how the story came to life, but it's only a small victory to see that the cover-up command didn't succeed. The best outcome might have been a soldier acknowledging his drive to kill the other guy (victim) but *not* doing so or at least getting stopped by his teammates. Stopped by friendly means, don't read it the wrong way.

I may place a more general note on the issue of having soldiers running around, doing the dirty and stressful work, which leaves them as the bad guys whereas we shouldn't forget who sent them there.

And, if worst comes to worst, I can be back in the States with a giant paycheck in under a week. 

I like living here. I have a nice apartment that costs me about 1/3rd of my apartment in SoCal. I have a great network of people who take care of me.

I don't go out much because the ""bars"" are a joke. If I wanted to drink the same three shitty beers (I am looking at you Ozujsko, Karlovacko and Pan) every night, I will do it at home. If I want to party I hop on a plane to Berlin or something. 

The food is crap unless you are eating at home or at a decent konoba. I just eat the food that my Croatian ""mothers"" make me and what my girl makes.

true,durandaI,,Expatrié,"Are you going to have a degree? There's a chance you could get an internship if your still in school. What are you reading at University? Can you code? Etc. etc. Need more information.

As far as living, I had a similar problem when I moved here last January. My girlfriend and I settled on a 40m2 apartment in Pantin, which is great. Bigger than what we can afford in Paris, and still on a metro line. Though if you have to commute in on the RER, that's fine too. 

Improving your french will be difficult without school. I can recomend the one I went to: Langue Onze. Friendly, relatively cheap, and 20 hours a week of class, if you want it.

For work, you can search for a [stage here](http://www.indeed.fr/emplois?q=stage+english&amp;l=paris).

Your main advantage is that you can speak English, so try to look for something that uses English as part of the work.

Um, living cheap in Paris. It's doable. If you don't go out to eat, you can bring in a grocery budget of about 30 euros a week, plus 450 for an apartment (with a roommate), plus 70 for a metro card, plus another 50 for bills. So Theoretically you could live on 690 euros a month, but lets round that up to 900 because you like to do things. So plan for something around there.

Finally, you should plan for your French not to actually get that much better, unless you're in school. Really, you'll find that the English speakers tend to hang with English speakers, and most of the people you'll interact with (Young, college educated, white french people) will speak enough English that they'll want to practice with you. You've got to be insistent in a polite way if you want to speak in French but can't carry a conversation well. Just, be fore warned. I know a lot of people who are here for a long time who never seem to learn French beyond the basic necessities.

Wasn't a ban, per se. :P
Well it kind of was, but wasn't. The only real effect, as I see it, was a monopoly on the word 'marriage', really.
Not saying some or maybe most of the proponents of that referendum wanted an actual ban(including the quite unlikeable woman who was at the head of the initiative), but it wasn't really one, in substance, legally speaking.

In all likelihood(the ruling party wants it and they have the necessary majority), in a couple of weeks a law in regards to civil unions(or some other term, I really don't remember), granting gay people pretty much every single right straight married couples have, except adoption(in the sense of adopting a child out of an orphanage, not in the sense of adopting the partner's child). I'm not 100% on this, so someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what I read in some of the media.

Perchè non vedo come un opzione roba come Sky o il Digitale Terrestre? Perchè sento sempre i miei colleghi che parlano di ciò che vi si trovi e di quanto lo paghino, e poi li sento sempre parlare di qualche trasmissione tipo quella del tipo che deve uccidersi di cibo o quella dei tipi che girano per mercatini alla ricerca di roba di valore. Non voglio fare lo snob del cazzo, ammesso e non concesso che sia un errore farlo, ma se già la televisione -normale- mi faceva pesantemente cagare, l'idea di -pagare- per vedere cose del genere mi fa ridere.

Tuttavia ammetto che essendo fuori dal tunnel da ormai sette anni io non sia realmente a conoscenza di quella che sia la reale offerta reperibile sulla televisione a pagamento, quale ne sia la forma, Sky come DT o altro. Ma sinceramente, dovrebbe fregarmene? Prima di andare a vivere da solo passavo almeno una o due ore al giorno guardando la tv. Poi sono rimasto senza televisione e successivamente, col passare del tempo, ascoltando dall'esterno i discorsi sulla tv, non mi è più neanche passato per la testa di comprarne una. All'epoca ero uno strambo, oggi conosco molta gente che non ha una televisione. 

Sinceramente oggi non avrei più il tempo nel corso della mia giornata per guardare qualcosa che non sia estremamente finalizzato, un documentario, una specifica serie tv, uno specifico film. 

Per quanto riguarda lo specifico della tua osservazione, sinceramente non sono sicuro che si applichi. Certo, su Internet girano cazzate indicibili, alcune le consumo anch'io. Ma se mi guardo attorno vedo che chi usa la televisione tende a consumare in maniera acritica quanto passiva, chi usa Internet tende ad elevare il proprio consumo. Non posso ovviamente parlare per grandi numeri e non entro nel merito di quale sia il livello di partenza, ma questa è sinceramente la mia impressione, con buona o cattiva pace di chi ancora oggi, anno di grazia 2013, riesce ancora a guardare Vespa o la Clerici.

We don't even have a national race or ethnicity to rally around.  Maybe you want to classify anti-government people as extremists and include them, but that wasn't what my comment was directed at.  I also didn't say we din't have any extremists at all.

Secondly, you need to differentiate between stupid racists and extremists.  OK, so you hear some stupid anti-Islamic comments by Americans, who do nothing else than make a comment.  These people aren't extremists, though they may be racists.  That isn't who I am talking about.  If you could point out recent comments by ""important"" politicians, I'd be happy to accept that.  

I don't know why you are being so sensitive about this.  Just look at all the anti-Jew, Islam and especially gypsys comments in /r/europe that appear to represent mainstream thought, and yet you mention anti-Islam comments by Americans.  It isn't even close, and you know it.

You can call us fat, say we lack universal healthcare or whatever the usual business is but you don't have a leg to stand on with this.  And I'm no 14 year old basement dweller in Kansas.  I've traveled plenty, studied abroad in Europe, had a long term relationship with a European woman and am still in touch with these people.  I personally observed more casual racism in a few months in Europe than the rest of my life.  I'm an American mutt who happens to be Jewish, but certainly doesn't look it.  Even in England I heard more Jewish comments then I have in my whole life here (including in Mississippi).  I know that is just anecdotal, as are your stories from your uncle.  We don't have parties here pushing to ban minarets and burkas and skullcaps.  And even if they did, they would not be allowed to.  The is a mosque under construction a block from Ground Zero, sure people protested and got pissed and complained, but legally they can not stop it from being constructed.  

You want to say some Western/Northern European countries may not have such a problem, I can buy that.  But I was talking Europe as a whloe, and that includes Greece, Hungary, Italy.  Hell, just look at the ultras in Italy.  I can't even imagine a professional sports team having an ethnic/nationaist identity.  RIght, you see shit like this all the time at baseball games in the US http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/10411146/Italian-football-hooligans-jailed-for-unprovoked-attack-on-Tottenham-Hotspur-fans-in-Rome.html.

I'd love to go on more, and will be happy to further debate you in a civil manner, but I must leave now.

&gt;1. Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.

&gt;2. A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.

&gt;3. The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.

&gt;4. For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it.
&gt;
&gt;  A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

true,adlerchen,null,null,"You realize that nuclear is nonrenewable just like fossil fuels right? The NEA estimates that we only have about 80 years of uranium supplies at *current* consumption rates in 2008 (6.5 mT/y). There's a lot more reactors in the world here in 2013 and more are on the way around the world.

We are going to hit peak uranium much sooner than people would like to think. As much as people want to bash the Greens and Germany over their stance, renewables are the only choice on the table that will still be there in a 100 years. Starting now is a lot better than starting then. It is objectively better to funnel money away from nuclear programs and into wind and solar. These industries need to be built up quickly.

During mid-90's it was planned to upgrade the railway tracks and to join European high speed network. (Most of the plans were not realized until today and those finished lines operate well bellow the envisioned speeds.)


At this time the management of Czech national railway operator got an great idea. They will buy high speed (up to 230 km/h) trains  and then commercially operate profitable lines like Berlin-Prague-Vienna. 

Initially they ordered 10 trains from a local manufacturer but this company went bankrupt after few years. An Italian manufacturer won the new contract but allocated money could buy only 7 Pendolino trains.

Pendolinos were delivered in 2003 and are in duty since 2005. Initially, they had many technical problems, at one point all the trains had to be grounded. The certification to operate in Austria and Germany was delayed by several years.

The plans to grab profitable international lines were dropped and the trains were used domestically and even there they didn't attract masses of passengers.
