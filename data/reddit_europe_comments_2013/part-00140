true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; Also, I'm detecting some religious undertones in your argument

I'm an atheist,if you read religion into our argument, it says so much more about you, than me. 

&gt; It's just that the way you present it is sheer vilification.

Why -the fact is that you haven't fixed it for 40 years. Is that villification? I mean, you agree with me that the system in Greece is due to the fact that the Greek people build it that way. You even wrote


 &gt;I agree that a large part of the population was complicit

Where is the vilification - we agree. 

&gt;That doesn't justify your extreme hatred and prejudice. 

What is the extreme hatred? I don't hate the Greeks, but for over 40 years, a majority have chosen a corrupt an inefficient system, because they wanted to. Personally I think it is fucked up and would have chosen the Finnish way.

&gt;So while I agree that the tax revenue as a percentage of GDP in Greece is low, I don't think that justifies any punishment or hatred.

Again  -what is the hatred? *You just agreed to the fact that that average Greek has profited from your corrupt system - an average Greek person have paid less than a Finnish person.* How is that hatred? When it comes to punishment - what? Give me a list of punishment. Furthermore, can't you see that the Greeks have wanted the level of service one has in Finland, but you haven't wanted to pay for it like the Finns - don't you realise that somethings got to give? And, the fact is, that while the economy isn't nice today (which also has a lot to do with the Euro, which I hate, but a whole different discussion) *you*, the Greeks haven't paid a lot of money, not at all, in comparison to the north. You have made money from your corrupt system, but now you have to pay. I guess you still have paid less than the Finns, even today. So, if you want to change it, you have to pay. But the Greks don't, still, and as long as the Greeks cheat on their taxes, the standard services will stay low. Cause and effect- not punishment, but a choice by the Greek people. 


&gt;I have done so all my fucking life. 

Good, I am glad to hear that. Now, if I can see a demonstration in Athens agains tax cheaters, I'd be happy :-). 


&gt;It's unfair that Greece's economy is driven to suicide. 

That is mostly because the Euro is a fucked up currency, but that is a whole different discussion. I do not like the Euro. I think you should leave it, honestly, I think it would be better for you. What you perceive as punishment is the fact that you are competing with the North, while being less efficient (even if the Greeks work hard, as they do, they produce less)and the only way you can compete is by pushing down salaries. At the same time the products you used to produce are less attractive since they are more expensive.  I don't like it either, but on this board, the Euro is a good currency. I hate it. However, it is not wilfull punishment, it is Economics 101,""What happens when you have a badly constructed currency"". It is important to separate those two. 

Also, you have to see it from the view of the average tax payer up north. They never voted for paying for anyone else, and now they have to. Part of it (which they don't get) is the extremely idiotic Euro, but part of it, is for the fact that the Greeks choose to build up a system that is fucked up. And, honestly - why on earth should they pay for the second part, at all? Even now they pay more in taxes than you do. What is fair and unfair now? 


&gt;I don't like indiscriminate layoffs of thousands of people. 

So, fire the inefficient ones. Why aren't you?  It is not going to be perfect, of course not. You seem to think that the EU can sit and point

true,amicocinghiale,italy,,"&gt;probabilmente una visione sommaria e stereotipata del mondo economico, ma tant'è

Sì, e ti dico perché. Una banca sembra brutta e cattiva semplicemente perché lavora con i soldi, in realtà (nella teoria) il suo è un ruolo fondamentale nella società: una banca (che svolge attività bancaria tradizionale) è chiamata *intermediario* finanziario non a caso, ma perché intermedia tra chi è disposto a impiegare ricchezza (chiunque abbia un deposito, famiglie, società) e chi è bisognoso di ricchezza per fare investimenti (chiunque chieda un prestito, famiglie, società), portando a una redistribuzione più efficiente del denaro (quando le cose vanno come dovrebbero).

Ovviamente le banche sono delle società e devono fare profitto per andare avanti, ma è sbagliata l'equivalenza profitto = assenza di etica, QUALSIASI società, da chi fa le scarpe ai computer, è improntata al profitto, ma non hai una visione negativa di queste come della banca.

Poi tu avrai sentito parlare di cose come *diritto al credito*; sono stupidaggini, è proprio la concessione di prestiti a chiunque una delle cause della crisi americana del 2007. Devi capire che quando uno ha un conto in banca, la banca è *debitrice* nei confronti di costui, gli deve dei soldi, e quindi vorrà investire questi soldi in investimenti sicuri. Ora siamo in crisi per cui è vero che le banche si cagano un po' sotto a prestare e fanno mille storie e questo **non** fa bene all'economia, ma io ti sto parlando di casi standard.

Poi c'è un altro modo di fare banca che è quello di, detto sommariamente, operare in Borsa o fondi o altro, ma anche la Finanza viene demonizzata: come sempre, non è lo strumento sbagliato in sé, ma l'uso che se ne fa. I derivati come future e option sono nati come metodi di assicurazione, poi se li usano per speculare non è che la Finanza è malvagia, servirebbe regolamentazione (che in Europa c'è abbastanza, sicuramente molto di più che in USA) ma questo è un altro discorso.

Insomma, togliti dalla testa che la banca è brutta e cattiva, ci sono persone disoneste in banca come in altri settori e ci sono persone oneste in banca come in altri settori, solo i primi fanno più scalpore proprio perché la banca ricopre un ruolo importantissimo nella società.
Poi se non ti ho convinto esistono, anche in Italia, le cosiddette [banche etiche](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banca_etica) che sono banche più trasparenti negli investimenti e improntate a cose come riguardo per l'ambiente, microprestiti ecc. ecc.

&gt;Una cosa che vorrei capire è, quanto lo studio dell'economia è dato da comprensione ed analisi dei meccanismi economici, e quanto da applicazione di formule?

Guarda, proprio perché sotto la categoria ""Economia"" ci ricade un gozzoviglione di roba, dipende da quello che fai. Da Economia ci esce il commercialista che non sa un accidenti di teorie economiche pure (perché non è il suo ambito) e ti escono policy-maker che non sanno fare una dichiarazione dei redditi.
Se ho capito bene a te piace l'ambito macroeconomico, e da quanto ho potuto vedere io, ci sono un 75% di comprensione dei meccanismi e un 25% di applicazioni di formule, ma la mia è un'esperienza limitata nell'ambito, inoltre ci sono corsi macroeconomici più improntati all'analisi quantitativa dove c'è molta più statistica di quanta ne abbia fatta io con l'indirizzo agli intermediari finanziari.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Actually you need to look at it from a statistical point of view. It does in fact costs less to offer welfare 

The financial cost is the least of the problem. The societal costs of people just hanging on isolatedly and not being active are much bigger.

&gt;because 1°) that guy is going to get back on it's feet 

Obviously in that case, but there's a group of people who don't seem to get out of it.

&gt;2°) quickly tired of those 400e/mo of welfare and look for a job paying way more because at least now he looks like an unemployed not really competent illegal worker but a potential desperate hard worker nontheless and not a hobo, which is kindah different.

It sadly doesn't work that way. The difference between the wage and the social payment needs to be big enough. I wouldn't start working fulltime to make €100 more than unemployment benefits, for example.

&gt;Then you have an at least productive worker instead of somebody starving in the streets and keep samu busy regularily if not police involved because it's creating a number of issues (thievery, assaults, ...). Which costs a shit ton more than welfare.

I agree, but what benefit does being a productive worker have when people don't reply to you soliciting a job? That's the problem. The money cost is just a bookkeeping issue.

The homeless are notoriously difficult to get into fixed housing anyway, even when offered free. They're just allergic, for lack of a better word, to routine. It's very rare for them to remain homeless because of a lack of money alone. Most of them get off the street when they are ready for it.

&gt;There's hundreds of empty building and at least three time as much savage dump locations, abandonned scrap yards and half constructed building, empty fields everywhere in and around major french towns. A HLM tower is dozens of time more efficient than roms surviving in trailers in an old car scrapyard, even built in the stupidest location around. And we have dozens of those in big towns like paris, rennes, lilles, nantes, ... don't try denying it. It's not favelas/shanty towns but sometimes it's rather close.

And stuffing one of those with homeless fresh off the streets would turn those back into savage dump locations in no time. These people typically have other issues than not having a house.",0,1373533858,null,0,false,0,cb0c11z,t3_1hxu9x,t1_cb0c11z,t1_cazs3jz,null,1430507834,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; We need a certain degree of surveillance. It's like a modern day Leviathan; a social contract in which we give up some of our inherent liberties in exchange for a higher degree of security. But there has to be a balance, and they way I see it, the scales are clearly tipped to the wrong side.

&gt; The kind of overreach that has now become apparent is a breach of trust that corrodes the faith we need to have in the our governments and its institutions for our societies to function.

&gt; It also has a chilling effect on the freedom of expression that is needed for a proper democracy. The feeling of being under observation creates stress. People are restricted in their communication when they feel their conversations aren't private or that their Web search for socially stigmatized content, be it political, sexual or health related, is being recorded and potentially judged.

&gt; Trust always goes both ways, and when the government mistrusts the population, the population will mistrust the government. Of course this isn't the same as the Stasi, but if our countries ever become oppressive, they'll already have the infrastructure in place.

As opposed to being isolated in the streets, being seen as lower than scum; living in trash of the gutter, ... ?

&gt; Obviously in that case, but there's a group of people who don't seem to get out of it.

Yeah it's the part you can still see when society is running high. But the fact that the number of homeless people tenfold during an economic crisis tends to make me think a lot of people does NOT intend to stay there; but when you can't pay the rent for the lack of tree fiddy, they try tossing you in the street anyway.

&gt; I wouldn't start working fulltime to make €100 more than unemployment benefits, for example.

Now you're being a little dishonest. 600€/Mo is a part time (half time) job. In France; the minimal legal wage for a full time is about 1100€ after taxes. It's like 2 to 3 times welfare money. It does tend to motivate.

&gt;  but what benefit does being a productive worker have when people don't reply to you soliciting a job? 

Because sooner or later employers will have to face the fact that most of their criters in their offers (""unpaid internship""; ""thousands of year of experience, wage of an illegal immigrant"", and other bullshit plagging 90% of the current offers) just does not work and will have to pay real wages and recruit really or face bankruptcy because there's nobody anymore.

It's the rebound we're waiting, and planning for. And we'll need workers at that moment. *Lots* of them.

&gt; The homeless are notoriously difficult to get into fixed housing anyway, even when offered free. They're just allergic, for lack of a better word, to routine. It's very rare for them to remain homeless because of a lack of money alone. Most of them get off the street when they are ready for it.

Now this is just feudal lord condescending ridiculous bullshit. ""oh oh oh those bloody peasant, don't give them any money they'll just waste it on alcool and drugs. Keep them farming for nuthing while i pay for my castl"".

In my town we had a number of illegal roms immigrant (from romania, *very* poor, living in the streets and in broken trailers in junkyards). They were like a hobo on two or three.
 
We gave a home to a number of them; and RSA (low level welfare). You know what happened ?

*Half of them stopped begging in like 3 months*. Pick pocketing diminished radically (by like 70%); burglary around camps by around as much; and they started integrating a lot more; and learning french. We have like a fifth of Paris' homelessness issue per same number of habitants or surface. If that's not success then i dunno what it is.

&gt; And stuffing one of those with homeless fresh off the streets would turn those back into savage dump locations in no time. These people typically have other issues than not having a house.

Yeah some of the buildings are a little gettoish or maybe trashy by our western standards. Recycle bins ain't used properly, there's tags on the wall and the elevator is dead most of the time. Etc

But compared to the calcutta-style waste dump they came from ? it's fucking clean. There's wayyyy less people in the street, and the cops doesn't show up more than like once a month (compared to every two/three days in some neighborhoods before).

So yeah, i'd say it works, and is an measurable improvement.

Most people treat poor people like cattle then act surprised when they have no dignity and act like beast. 

If you want people to act better you need to 1°) treat them like (sane) humans 2°) offer them a hand first and help, if not in monetary value stop acting like they were indesirable invaders 3°) like i just said not act like they were your ennemy 4°) oncee you've shown you're not just there to arrest them like the cops, push them on more adequate solutions for everyone. 

And even if they never started working in the most bad case (which i'll never believe is the case but will follow for the sake of the argument), I'd rather know the region ""waste"" some money on welfare if only for the sake of not seeing as much hobos in the streets. At least it's cleaner, and you don't need to crack down on anyone china style to do it and keep most streets clean on working non economical crisis society level.

That is most obvious in Greece, but quite common also in most other ~~southern European~~ historically catholic countries.

Including countries outside of Europe like NZ, AU, US, CA, etc. that all where predominently settled by protestant people.

So, whatever protestantism seems to have caused in people's minds, it made them more honest and prone to cooperate more efficiently. Now, we have to get the historically catholic societies on board if we want Europe to be a long-term success.

Il est plus rentable aujourd'hui de laisser son argent dormir sur des placements à faible rendement ou de spéculer sur les marchés financiers et les marchés de matières premières que de faire des investissements dits productifs, qui financent l'industrie, les services et la consommation des ménages, mais qui sont plus risqués. L'inflation, en faisant perdre progressivement sa valeur à l'argent qui dort, favorise son déplacement et donc les investissements, et contribue à relancer l'économie.

Inflation faible = croissance faible et chômage élevé.
Inflation forte = croissance forte et chômage faible. Le choix a été fait depuis quelques temps déjà. Et il profite à qui ?

No, as opposed to being a valued part of society. I said it wasn't to be considered a success, merely a fallback measure; I didn't say don't do it. It's like abortion: it may be the best choice is some circumstances, but it does mean that all forms of family planning failed.

&gt;Yeah it's the part you can still see when society is running high. But the fact that the number of homeless people tenfold during an economic crisis tends to make me think a lot of people does NOT intend to stay there; but when you can't pay the rent for the lack of tree fiddy, they try tossing you in the street anyway.

If you have any decent unemployment benefits that doesn't happen. I'm talking about the baseload of homeless.

&gt;Now you're being a little dishonest. 600€/Mo is a part time (half time) job. In France; the minimal legal wage for a full time is about 1100€ after taxes. It's like 2 to 3 times welfare money. It does tend to motivate.

This varies wildly from country to country, but in any case you have to deduct working expenses, including clothes, transport, childcare, etc. and then also take into account the fact that typically working people are less eligible for benefits like cheap housing and other forms of assistance. A lot of people would rather stay at home taking care of their own children and doing their own laundry than going out and take care of someone else's children and laundry for a minimal financial difference. The solution to that is to provide meaningful jobs and higher wages, of course.

&gt;Because sooner or later employers will have to face the fact

Employers don't face the facts; they make other people face the facts the way they want them to face them.

&gt;It's the rebound we're waiting, and planning for. And we'll need workers at that moment. Lots of them.

There is no indication whatsoever that we're going to need a lot of workers for anything anytime soon. Labor efficiency rises, we're going to need less and less workers.

&gt;Now this is just feudal lord condescending ridiculous bullshit. ""oh oh oh those bloody peasant, don't give them any money they'll just waste it on alcool and drugs. Keep them farming for nuthing while i pay for my castl"".

Some people are just that mangled that they have trouble remembering where they slept last night, and they lash out at people trying to help them.

&gt; If that's not success then i dunno what it is.

If you start from a total crap situation it's not very hard to improve. I'm basing what I say on the situation in Brussels.

It's because of the historical precedent regarding how states were created. The idea of a welfare state that gives back to the taxpaying citizens (instead of extracting a profit from them like a mafia asking for protection money) is relatively new. I agree with you that the lines are blurred these days and calling for the abolition of the state might lead people to think that they advocate for a lawless Wild West type of society, which is not true at all. 

&gt; If I remember Webers definition of the state a state is an entity that has suverenity (right translation?) and a monopoly on the use of force. So to enforce laws you obviously need force, and since laws by definition should apply to everyone to be fair you need a ""common force"" to do it.

The word you were looking for is ""sovereignty"". The problem with this definition is that it presupposes a separation between the state and its citizenry. One way to view the anarchist ideal is a society in which the distinction is meaningless and the state is the same as the collective decisions (and enforcement of said decisions) of the citizens. 

&gt; But yes anarchy is fun to think about and its ideas about personal freedom and flat structures should certainly be important to any modern society and state. It worries me a bit that europe seems to be heading to a more centralised power structure :(

government spending, intervention, price fixing and better management. People generating revenue out of profits tend to manage their stuff better because they receive the product of their labors while knowing how and where it is generated. This is a form of decentralisation which is always better then central planning. As a result people tend to be more creative, competitive and they tend to enter a permanant self betterment state. This is also good for prices since in a competitive market services are to be offered at the best cost efficiency making it better for the general population.

that's not true and no factual evidence can support this to my knowledge.

&gt;Also, it is idiotic to compare with the economy in the 1860's.

no it is not and I would like you to justify this statement. in fact what I am comparing is pre-1950 and post-1950 where the only change was governments role in its economy. Thus the economy is comparable but not the politics.

And by the way in 1860 Sweden was not poor it did not grow from a poor economy to a rich one but an average european country to an world economic powerhouse. UP to this day sweden still has one of the most open and unregulated markets givin it its top edge.

And indeed how some are today. I think that its just the whole ""abolition of the state"" thing that seems a bit ridiculous to me. What these countries need is not a lack of state but rather one that is better, more lawful and with a flatter structure. When you discuss this stuff on reddit, some (strawmen :) ) people seem to be like ""hurr durr state bad, freedom (market mostly) good"". Its annoying. Freedom is of course good, but it doesn't exclude a strong and fair state sector, rather I think it might be a prerequisite to actually having and keeping freedom.  

&gt;The word you were looking for is ""sovereignty"". The problem with this definition is that it presupposes a separation between the state and its citizenry.

In my mind it doesn't necessarily presuppose a separation between state and citizens. But of course this is not the case in a lot of countries. ""We are all the state, and the state is us""

I think I'm probably colored by the fact that I'm from a very small egalitarian country where the ""distance"" between politicians and common people seems very small. The state doesn't seem like a separate entity to me in the same degree as it would for someone from a more autocratic or elite-run society.

&gt; [...] Is that villification? [...]

This an answer to various things you say, all of which sum up to ""We agree that Greece is fucked up, so where's the hatred and vilification in what I said?"". The problem is that you take the fucked up system and you use it as a justification for the current suffering. I don't have a problem with you saying ""Greece is fucked up"". I have a problem with you saying ""Greece is fucked up, therefore the Greeks deserve all the suffering they are getting now"". You don't seem to understand that your idea of ""you have to pay for your mistakes"" requires very real suffering (hunger, no healthcare, etc) on the part of the most vulnerable members of the population. We have reached the point that a lot of people are not paying their taxes because they can't afford it. Do you have any idea what that means?

If you are willing to move away from your punitive framework and you are ready to approve a realistic and constructive way of improving the failing countries, I'm all for it. 

&gt; So, fire the inefficient ones. Why aren't you?

There are three problems here. One is corruption. The current political elites are very corrupt and they won't throw out their supporters even if they're also corrupt and inefficient.  The second is technical. Finding the very inefficient ones who are just dead weight takes time and I don't think there's that many of them. The troika is breathing down the government's neck for the tens of thousands layoffs. It's simply unrealistic. Third, there's a humanitarian aspect. Greece is currently almost completely lacking a social safety net. So, these ""undesirables"", instead of being given a new chance at life, they are marginalised and pauperised.

Now the seaport in Ukraine is one of the main military seaports Russia uses to house their navy in the Black Sea. Building another seaport would cost too much (monetarily and politically both).

They build stuff that will never payoff (nordstream) just to keep others dependant on them.

Aucune importance puisque dans le libre, le code est disponible donc si besoin, n'importe qui peut reprendre la maintenance.

Je commence a me demander si je ne réponds pas a un troll... Le format Word change régulièrement pour obliger les utilisateurs a acheter la nouvelle version. OpenOffice essaye de suivre. Le but est d'utiliser des formats libres, pas d'utiliser OpenOffice pour lire ou écrire du Word. Il n'est d'ailleurs pas normal que les citoyens doivent acheter des logiciels propriétaires pour lire les documents publics.

D'autre part, il ne faut pas oublier que laisser notre gouvernement utiliser des logiciels dont le code source n'est pas visible, c'est donner les clés du gouvernement aux éditeurs de logiciels.

Update: The first comment explains why the article is sensationalist better than I could say it.

&gt;So DB receives collateral from a lender equal to the value of the loan. It then sells the collateral, gets the cash, and lends the proceeds to the collateral owner. DB has a ""collateralized"" loan as an asset, offset by a short in a government bond which can easily be hedged or covered. Where is the risk to DB in this transaction? Pennies at most? 

&gt;The risk is in the collateral, already sold by DB, going bad. That risk, as described, is still held by the bank who borrowed the money on repo.

Porto i capelli molto lunghi e dicono che assomigli a un leone (le persone buone, perlomeno). Sono felicemente fidanzato da 3 anni e mezzo, con un'universitaria che sta prendendo la triennale in Servizio Sociale. Nonostante le premesse non siano rosee, crediamo ancora in un futuro in cui poter vivere davvero, e sogniamo di trasferirci negli States. A settembre inizierà la ricerca del lavoro, punto al campo dell'informatica (qualsiasi cosa, anche se spero in un bel posticino da programmatore mobile o qualcosa del genere), ma, nel caso avessi difficoltà a trovare lavoro in questo campo, mi accontenterei di qualsiasi cosa che mi permettesse di mettere via qualche soldino per volare via dal nido e costruirmi vita e famiglia. Per il resto, traduco un webtoon, lurko su reddit e altri millemila siti, ascolto moltissima musica (fin troppa) e gioco a qualsiasi videogame attiri la mia attenzione (approssimativamente tutti). Sono anche un discreto conoscitore dell'Universo Espanso di Star Wars, che amo con tutto il mio cuore, e un collezionista di action figures e gadget inerenti. Fino a qualche tempo fa (prima dell'esame di maturità) seguivo un sacco di testate Marvel, e oggi vado in fumetteria per tornare a coltivare questa passione. Sono un assiduo frequentatore di /r/trees (if you know what it means) e sono un ragazzo rilassato e tranquillo. Non sono stato accettato su mturk, e non ho chiaro il perchè. Comunque, ora, non faccio assolutamente nulla (doppia negazione FTW) e dormo a metà le mie giornate e gioco ai vg l'altra metà. Soffro di  passioni momentanee, che non sono una gran bella cosa. Il mio nick vero sarebbe ""hankvenom"" ma qui su reddit (e **solo** qui su reddit era preso) e quindi sono andato per la mia tag hvpd23=(hankvenom psychodelice 23).

La license n'est pas le problème. Le prix demandé par les organismes de formation, si.

&gt;Aucune importance puisque dans le libre, le code est disponible donc si besoin, n'importe qui peut reprendre la maintenance.

Ça c'est une vieille rengaine du logiciel libre de tout temps. Sauf que c'est pas vraiment comme ça que ça marche. Oui le code est dispo, oui n'importe qui peut l'éditer, et c'est pour ça que tout fonctionne nickel tout le temps dans le monde du libre. 

Par exemple, X11 n'est plus pas un tas de merde tirant Linux vers le bas depuis le début, et qui ne force plus tout le monde a travailler avec des hacks douteux pour développer de simples choses comme l’accessibilité du système aux personnes aveugles.

Dans le même genre, ALSA, OSS (dans sa version libre), PulseAudio, et tous les autres sous systèmes audio libres ne sont plus des lignes de code qui marchent on ne sais pas trop comment et ne tiennent plus ensemble avec du scotch. Pour la défense d'OSS, sa version closed source est bien mieux maintenue et simple d'usage que le reste.

D'après nos bon vieux FLOSSeurs, il suffirait juste d'employer quelque gugusses pour réparer tout les problèmes, et roule ma poule on a plus besoin de Photoshoppe. 

Sauf qu'il est bien plus efficace encore une fois de payer une boite de devs pour obtenir un logiciel taillé comme il faut et collant à un cahier des charges définis que de prendre un modèle existant et y coller plus de rustines qu'il n'y avait de code au départ pour le rendre fonctionnel, mais ça cela échappe bien évidemment aux idéalistes qui sont loin d'avoir à prendre ce genre de décision dans leur vies.

Actually that comparison is...Good. Accidents happens and you need to plan contingences of them as much as possible, not leave people in the dirt imho. Modern countries allow abortion, and modern countries should take car of their own even if they fall down on the money owning part.

&gt; If you have any decent unemployment benefits that doesn't happen

Most unemployment has a time limit. The issue is that with the crysis it takes more and more time each years to land another job because employers become a little greedy/needy nowadays. I was unemployed to years ago i basically sent about *two hundred* demands to as much employers before landing one *at the last possible moment* before not being able to pay bills anymore by and got the job by what was mostly a freak cosmic accident.
If i hadn't got it i'd be basically another of those homeless. Not very funny, because i think i did my best to get a job.

&gt; This varies wildly from country to country

Yes but i was mostly talking about Europe (the one place where i think i vaguely know what's actually going on), where most countries have a high minimum.

&gt; but in any case you have to deduct working expenses, including clothes, transport, childcare, etc. 

All of this is included in the welfare amount. Expenses ain't really covered beyond in our countries (except for rent where there is gov help, state ran utilities which look the other way when you can't pay the bill if a social worker justify it, and sometime food tickets ). Which is why it's actually easier to just give welfare and be done with it.

&gt; benefits like cheap housing and other forms of assistance

That's part of the issue. HLM (""habitation à loyer modéré"", ""limited  rent bill housing"" or something like that) start being as ridiculously high as private full cost housing is. We actually need to break housing costs; because the goal used to be ""house everyone"" and now it's ""pressure the people as much as possible to death and the last drop to line the execs and corrupt politicians pockets"". We'll need to do some house cleaning at that level sooner or later.

&gt; A lot of people would rather stay at home taking care of their own children and doing their own laundry than going out and take care of someone else's children and laundry for a minimal financial difference.

If you offer them thrice the welfare amount they'll still do it. And then if they do take a few months or years off in their life, *so fuckin what ?* . We ain't born to just slave away at somebody's else order. Let the fuck people cool off some times. You can't spend your entire life fighting the entire fuckin system or you'll go crazy. It's how you produce those insane fuckers ending up doing shootings and just generally hating everyone to the core.

&gt; The solution to that is to provide meaningful jobs and higher wages, of course.

In the end yes. But i'm not stupid or guiliable enough to believe people will just jump from homelessness to engineering level pays in one fell swoop. It takes time and you start back with ""crap"" pay like part time jobs or a single grand a month, which is still times better. Then you study or get experience in life to integrate more in the system overtime (and if you don't your kids will !) and get a better deal in the end.

Starting by low level welfare, and housing for everyone is probably a more realistic immediate goal than ""YEAH LET'S MAKE THE CRISIS OVER RIGHT NOW §§§"". Oh and it's also possible on one side and not the other one, and won't break our current system or bankrupt anyone.

For the billionaire and corporate tax payers evading trillions of taxes, a few hundreds per head for a few ten thousands is pocket money. Not even a single minute of their earnings. For the gov budget it's not even close to a rounding error, and the money will be used to pay basic unavoidable bills anyway (rent, food, gaz, clothes ...) and is not lost in anyway. So i think we should do it because it's one of those small objectives that would help us fighting the worsening situation country wide and crisis.

&gt; Employers don't face the facts; they make other people face the facts the way they want them to face them.

Till the point where nobody wants to work for them and they either STFU and abid reality or collapse. Watch wallmart, really close. It's the perfect example of what's going to happen countrywide. A megacorp falling because they did not want to face reality and always send the bills to everyone else and never pay anything. It's the end of the road for them. Give it ten more years and most of the employers are gonna be facing the same ""choice"".

&gt; There is no indication whatsoever that we're going to need a lot of workers for anything anytime soon

I disagree, based on western europe history. The current situation makes me think about the ""glorious sixties"", and may 68. The same situation is really in the air, in my humble opinion. And employers HAD to give in in the end and the economy became REALLY prosperous and recruited TONS of people in the same time.

&gt;  Labor efficiency rises, we're going to need less and less workers.

Robotisation, yes. I agree, and it's the end goal. But 1°) we're not there yet 2°) it creates different jobs, one machines can't replace (like repairing said machines) 3°) we can always use the law to rise tax on the new richs and redistribute said money throught the welfare system, and expand it. 

It's gonna make a few people scream, but if you lok at the picture system-wide :
- There is more wealth created
- There are not much more people

Therefore, it's all about redistribution. Now i'm not a complete morron and i don't think URSS would work, history has proved it quite enough. But i think we can get a welfare system to work more or less and feed and build homes for everyone.

&gt; Some people are just that mangled that they have trouble remembering where they slept last night,

Yes, but i don't think everyone who can't pay his own rent is necessarily a drug addict, hardcore alcoolic or other unwilling people.

&gt; If you start from a total crap situation it's not very hard to improve. 

Yeah, but if we can keep out of the street a people on two in an human way (offer him an home and not in jail) i'll call it a victory and shut the hell up because at least we offer an exit to those willing to try it.

&gt; to have included the 25% poorest of the population with it... 

The issue is in france *a lot, and i mean a lot* of kids are dependant on their family for housing. I mean, we have an entire generation which can't make do by itself. The day pop/mom/whoever stop being around to pay the bill it's going to be a disaster.

So yes, our 25% poorest part of our population is on the verge of homelessness in occident. Just look at greece if you don't believe me about how it could end up if we don't react soon.

Yeah, greece, spain, portugal, ... Maybe those don't exist and i just exagerate everything ?

1.) Due to different living conditions (e.g. cheaper education) and especially the social security system (e.g. health insurance, paid maternity/paternity leaves, etc) wages are generally somewhat lower. This goes especially for higher academic / leadership positions.

2.) You generally have 4 weeks of paid vacation but some companies give a few days extra.

3.) I'd guess starting salary in that position for someone with an academic background but very little job experience would be approx. 36 - 40 k €. This highly depends on the job description, esp. required experience, and the size of the company. 
 
4.) Do you have a job description? It's hard to tell how you can differentiate yourself from other applicants.

If a culture devalues certain groups of people even (at first) perfectly neutral words for that group become devalued by association. Old High German “dioma” was a neutral word for “young girl”. Middle High German “dieme” was a word for “young female servant/maid” (not, strictly speaking, negative but much more functional and low status). Today “Dirne” is a word for prostitute. (This is true for many words that describe women. “wib” in Old High German – also related to the English “wife” – used to be a neutral word for woman/wife. Nowadays “Weib” is a clearly very negative word for “woman” in German. It’s an insult. Please note that the equivalent words for men did not undergo this same process. I wonder why ...)

“Ausländer” seems to be undergoing the same process and we are in the middle of it. For me personally “Ausländer” has definite negative connotation and I try not to use it. Something about that word makes me cringe. But we are right in the middle of that – so many others do not have any problems with the word. (Instead I try to be specific: someone is from some place or moved here from some place. Someone has parents from some place or grandparents from some place. More generally, people who moved here from someone else will be referred to as “Einwanderer"" or ""Migranten” by me – but only if they themselves actually moved here.)",0,1373558247,null,0,false,0,cb0hv7s,t3_1i1i92,t1_cb0hv7s,t1_cb0agdf,null,1430505011,7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,7

Yes, I am taking this as something personal. We are talking about the future of my country and my people. When we talk about austerity we talk about who has right to health care and education. we talk about the future of my people. And, I care about that.

&gt; Hence there is high corruption and little cooperation between people.

Are you telling that there is little cooperation between people? If that was true, the things will be way worse. We have an unemployment of 27% and 40% of them don't retrieve benefits. Who is taking care of them? It's not the government.

&gt; Whatever, if you don't care about Spain's future and just think about yourself, then do that

I think that you don't understand what's the austerity to us. The austerity seems to be a trick to give the money that was used in public service to rich people. And a lot of people wants to change that. Everybody sees how we have more and more unemployment and more and more poverty. And hell, that scares us. And we want to do something to change that. What else to do you expect? Should we see how our countries are ruined without doing something? And the people doesn't do the smartest choice always. If the conventional politics don't work maybe we should listen to the asshole who says that we can fix everything with simple and demagogic actions.

In fact, Spain is a country where the electoral system, although imperfect and favoring bipartisanship, bestows citizens a realistic chance at overthrowing that bipartisanship. Why is that important if there are corrupt people inside every party? well, mainly for two reasons:

* Corruption is not equally spread in every party. The standard procedure and treatment of corrupt politicians when scandals are unveiled are also different.

* Even more important: the reason why there are so many corrupt politicians is the lack of accountability, both legal and political. While bipartisanship persists, they know people will still vote for them in order for the other major party not to win. And if they remain in power, they can keep making their own laws to protect themselves legally. But what happens if more parties break into the race? that safety disappears; now there are more real options for people to turn to, and some of them, if they won, would also make their legal protection disappear.

For some years, minor parties have been gaining track (despite being discriminated against by the electoral law) and are turning into a real threat for the two big ones (which unsurprisingly also happen to be the most corrupt).

I'm not sure about all this but I will try to help : 
You should have an european driver license : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_driving_licence which should be enough.


Incase you have an old model of license (like me): get an ""international"" license. At least there's one ""international"" license that is just a translation of your current license (no new tests, done in the same moment) so you could rent/drive a car outside spain, probably there's something similar for the UK, but not sure, I used it to go to the US without any problem.


In Spain we have ""A1 license"" for &lt;=125cc and ""A license"" for &gt;125cc motorbikes. **Additionally** if you have a ""B license"" (cars) for at least three years, you could drive motorbikes up to 125cc (A1)


A1 test is almost the same as A (with a little practical difference), I would suggest that if you're interested, go for the A license instead.

Anyway, I suggest you to get the tests made in the UK in English, since with the same license you could drive here.

/r/running is a nice support group to use if you have any issues with anything at all; I'm lurking there at the moment because I'm having a lot of trouble running in the 27 degree heat.

If you start running in Paris now, and then start timing yourself and comparing to others etc, bare in mind the heat. Your times will suffer immensely due to various physiological changes that happen to the body in heat. 

Keep going and adapt your running distances and times as you progress. Running for longer and slower is better than running shorter distances and faster.

&gt; How many nuclear weapons has Brussels made you babysit near Dublin
The same number as the UK. Zero.
&gt;What sweeping tax reforms has Brussels forced upon Ireland?
We're in the middle of the worst recession in Irish history. Brussells has imposed lots of austerity upon Ireland in order to pay back wreckless German/French banks and bondholders.

Are you on drugs? Read the post again. My point is that Ireland is better off within a larger Union, be it Britain or the EU. Independence has not worked very well for us. And yes, i'd fully support joining the UK again if we were not in the EU, we fell decades behind economically and socially when we left it. Hopefully we'll petition for membership of the Commonwealth in a few years.

The idea in here is that Russia sees US and US based organizations as more potential threats to it as US is capable to intervene or threaten Russia at its borders, but Russia is not capable on doing the same with the US.

Edit: I think I said something about this here a while ago, but I think we should have a mini European Union style federation for the British Isles (sorry Ireland, that's just what they're called). If we were a republic, we could invite the Republic of Ireland to join, with the incentive of seeding Northern Ireland back to them. If the UK as we know it and royalty no longer existed, it would suck allot of wind out of both of their sails. As there are four major countries in the British isles and an election for each country's leader is held once every four years, we could each take it in turns to be president of the union for one year.

I mean we could be in the European free trade area but create our own equal political union of England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Isle of man etc. 

So:

* England wouldn't have to be in the European Union.

* Scotland would gain independence from England (Westminster).

* Ireland would be reunited **and** Northern Ireland would still be part of a union with Great Britain.

* We would be a bigger union, more equal union and a more independent union sharing and coordinating the burden of defence, foreign policy (that'll be a tricky one) infrastructure, research &amp; development etc.

Ho provato a comparare Milano e Berlino usando [questo sito](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/comparison.jsp).

Taxi Start (Normal Tariff)	 4.00 €	     3.20 €	      -20.00 %

Taxi 1km (Normal Tariff)	 1.03 €	     1.82 €	      +77.18 %

Taxi 1hour Waiting (Normal Tariff)	 26.86 €	     25.37 €	      -5.55 %


Sulla chiamata a Berlino abbiamo un risparmio di 80 centesimi. Ma poi sul costo al km viene il 77% in più.

Proviamo con un'altra città. Milan vs Monaco:


Taxi Start (Normal Tariff)	 4.00 €	     3.05 €	      -23.75 %

Taxi 1km (Normal Tariff)	 1.03 €	     1.50 €	      +45.63 %

Taxi 1hour Waiting (Normal Tariff)	 26.86 €	     24.00 €	      -10.65 %

Non mi sembra che ci sia questo gran risparmio neanche a Monaco. 

Non è che forse molte persone nel loro paese il taxi lo prendono pochissimo e quando vanno all'estero, essendo costrette non avendo lì un mezzo proprio, hanno la sensazione di spendere tantissimo?


Su [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab#Results_of_deregulation_in_specific_localities) parlano di quello che è successo in alcuni paesi dopo la deregulation dei taxi:

-Negli Stati Uniti i prezzi sono aumentati

-In Giappone c'è stata una modesta diminuzione, però le corse in taxi restano tra le più care del mondo

-In Olanda c'è stato un notevole aumento dei prezzi

-In Nuova Zelanda i prezzi sono diminuiti in maniera consistente 

-A Dublino sono diminuiti i tempi d'attesa, non parla dei prezzi e comunque c'è scritto che manca una fonte o una citazione.

again, if you have a B license for three years, you are good to go here. my driver license for car was 900€ 9 years ago without failing any tests and with the minimum practical classes required, i would expect it to be more expensive nowadays, A1 or A license should be around the same prime as a B license. 


if you already know how to drive its really good but you have to still pay for a minimum number of practical classes (required by law) at a driver school, i think for B license are 15 classes. theorical test should be easy as modt of the questions are common sense but if you have just taken your first spanish class it could be difficult. 

anyway, tests prices depends a lot on the region/state you are taking the test, so it would be different from one region to another. driver school are kind of a lobby and are known to set prices, so it should be more or less the same for all school in the same area.

Same with Derry, etc. There are actually only two counties with a protestant majority, but whatever thats a formality.

I think it's only a matter of time, or well, something has to happen. It's been my experience that a lot of the catholic youth here really strongly identify as Irish in comparison to their parents, especially in Belfast. In fact I have a neice who speaks Irish as her first language. Anyway, it's not like tensions are ever gonna die down, and mostly I've lost all hope for this country/province.

Meglio i dati oggettivi. Anche la tua amica tedesca parlava di esperienze personali, ma poi in Germania come hai visto il taxi non costa molto di meno rispetto a noi. Anzi non costa proprio di meno.

&gt;negli USA prendere il taxi a New York 

New York (ma anche Chicago) è una metropoli enorme, è chiaro che lì esci alzi la mano e viene il taxi. Fra l'altro a New York è proprio vietato prenotare i taxi, mi pare abbiano pure bandito le app per smartphone. Per il prezzo: al tassista in genere si dà anche la mancia. A Seattle e in molte altre città puoi prenotare il taxi al telefono, non ricordo se paghi la chiamata però.
E sui loro prezzi influisce il costo della benzina che negli Stati Uniti costa molto di meno grazie ai petroldollari. I taxi come erano? Io ricordo di averne visti molti un po' vecchiotti.

Questo è uno studio sulla taxi deregulation negli Stati Uniti:

*A study of taxi deregulation in nine United States cities found that the number of taxi firms increased, but large incumbent firms continued to dominate all but one of the nine cities.[53] The taxi prices did not fall in real terms, but increased in every city studied.[54] Turnover was concentrated among small operators (usually one-cab operators); little turnover occurred among medium and large new firms and no exit by a large incumbent firm occurred since deregulation.[55] Productivity decreased by at least one-third in all four cities for which sufficient data was obtainable; the authors argued that decreases of this magnitude in productivity have serious economic consequences for taxi drivers, by shifting the industry from employee drivers to lease drivers and causing the average taxi driver to earn a lower income.[56] Innovation in service did not occur in the deregulated cities because such innovations (especially shared-ride service) were doubted by taxi operators to be justified by demand and because the operators viewed that they would cause a net decrease in revenue.[56] Discounts were offered in certain deregulated cities; however, these discounts were small (10% typically) and were also offered in some regulated cities.[56] The study found a lack of service innovation and little change in level of service despite the increased number of taxicabs.[57]*

Comunque i tuoi €9.5 in Italia dipendono da dove si trovava il taxi che ha preso la chiamata. Ma non solo. Per esempio in provincia di Milano alcuni comuni, pochi per fortuna, non hanno aderito a permettere ai taxi di Milano di sostare nelle loro piazzole. Così a loro volta loro non possono sostare a Milano. Questo vuol dire che se chiami un taxi di Sesto San Giovanni trovandoti a Sesto ti costa il doppio, perché gli devi pagare andata e ritorno. Però se alzi la cornetta e chiami una cooperativa taxi di Milano arriva lì a Sesto in un paio di minuti e la corsa ti costa la metà. 

A Milano mi sembra ci sia una buona copertura e che i prezzi non siano alti, sono più le cooperative di alcune province che ti pelano.

I have noticed that a lot of people make no difference whatsoever between the New and the Old testament. Judaism follows the Old one and Christianity is the New one. The new testament is all about ""If you get slapped on one cheek, give the other."" Islam is, indeed, the most violent religion. Because you see Christianity never suggest anything similar to Jihad. 

Besides even if the Bible was as violent as the Qur'ran(which it is not) we see that in the modern times that Christian countries are all accepting and tolerant. Unlike Muslim countries where the Sharia suggests that a woman deserves to be stoned to death for being raped. I can never respect Islam. I respect Buddhism, because Buddhism is pretty nice and it can teach you lots of things. But Islam is...evil. It's basically because of Islam that I have to take my shoes off and be treated as a criminal at the airport. Yes, I am Islamophobic in the real meaning of the word(phobia means fear). I am afraid of Islam, I am afraid that the plain I'm in may be kidnapped, I'm afraid that I might be taken hostage in a theater, I'm afraid that a plane may crash in my building, I am scared that one day my daughter may not be allowed to show her face, I am afraid that the subway I use may get blown up.

And don't get me wrong-I am not a Christian who is defending his religion. I'm atheist and I know how stupid some Christian beliefs are, trust me. But unlike most atheist I don't feel superior to people who believe and I have actually taken of my time to study religions. So it is that I have come to the understanding that Islam is by far the worst religion that is alive and well to this day.

true,meidei,ANAR,isyanάσταση!,"&gt; Finland can hardly be called a self-sustaining country, actually the country is very dependent on global trade and on exports

That's what I meant, though I phrased it poorly. Finland depends on exports (and has lots of successful companies doing that). Cyprus has very limited exports and that will only change if we actually find natural gas in our waters and start extracting it (something that I actually find unethical but what can you do). 

Now, on comparing an industrialised city to a small island. My point is that Vaasa exists in a bigger country. They don't have to do everything. You mentioned they are an electricity cluster. They can focus on that while they have other parts of the country specialising in something else. Eg water processing, agriculture. Cyprus is at best 10 times the size of Vaasa, it's hardly flat and suffers from chronic water and energy shortages. It's difficult to have a sizable industry/manufacturing sector. 

As I said, I can see the light manufacturing sector growing, but not by much, and not until we find solutions to the water and energy shortages. I really don't see how we can have heavy manufacturing though. 

I'd like to see us investing in different kinds of services instead. I'd be more ethically comfortable with Cyprus becoming an educational/research/medical hub rather than a bankingland or an oil-exporting country. English is our working language, we have legal frameworks for both public and private universities, we have at least one medical research centre that does a good job (in the sector of neurology), we could invest more on that vein.

I have a friend who studied at Dalhousie University in Halifax and a professor there had said something about how the maritimes would likely be ceded to the United States if Quebec declared independence.

British and Irish Isles is fine. It recognizes that there are two major islands. It does not use a term which is clearly now political (just as 'Irish' is) to refer to two islands with separate political entities.

*Gli sfruttatori hanno un nome e un cognome  si chiamano Brokers che sono individui senza scrupoli legalizzati dal Comune di New York esattamente dalla TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission) del comune di NY.*

*Udite udite: per fare il tassista a New York non è necessario conoscere l’inglese,  la scuola per ottenere l’abilitazione alla guida del taxi è di 8 ore e poi è vero che la toponomastica è semplice, però 8 ore secondo me non possono bastare. Ottenuta l’abilitazione il tassista si reca in uno dei garage che controllano tutte o quasi le licenze della grande mela. Esistono anche dei tassisti che sono proprietari di licenza e lavorano per loro stessi, ma sono molto rari. Perché lavorare quando non facendo nulla si incassa ugualmente?*

*L’immigrato first job versa al brokers dai 150 ai 200 dollari per prendere una vettura taxi e se è sporca deve lavarla, farci il pieno e incominciare a trottare.*

2) Quello è per poter guidare il taxi. Ma il ""Medallion"" costa:

*The number of taxis are restricted by a government-controlled medallion system, which has powerful lobbyists who keep a stranglehold on the laws in order to keep the valuations artificially high for the limited number of taxi medallions.*

Comunque sto parlando con una persona a cui non frega niente di approfondire un argomento, non mi interessa continuare la discussione con te.

Però per curiosità mi sono andato a cercare cosa dice [un rapporto](http://www.taxi-library.org/kang0898.htm) sull'argomento e cosa intende per deregulation e lo riporto qui perché magari può interessare ad altri:

**3.1.2.2 Regulations.**

The most significant law is the Haas Act adopted in 1937, which provided for the automatic renewal of vehicle licences and allowed transfer of licences between owners, conditioned only on approval of the new owners' qualifications by city. This transferability provision was vital to the subsequent establishment of licence values. The Act also erected a wall between fleet-owned taxi licences and individually owned licences, a clause intended to ensure the survival of owner-drivers.

The Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) was created in 1971 by the City Council legislation to regulate and improve taxi and livery service in New York City and establish an overall transportation policy governing these services. As a city agency, the TLC sets the taxi fares, licenses taxi drivers and vehicles, adopts rules that drivers and cab owners must follow, and puts each taxicab through an extensive inspection every four months.

The TLC establishes licensing standards for both drivers and owners (such as requiring that all new drivers pass an English test and training course), and determines the size, age and condition of vehicles. For example, TLC adopted regulations in 1996, requiring that taxicabs be replaced after no more than 5 years in service, and that vehicles be brand new when put into service. In addition, the TLC investigates passengers' complaints, issues and adjudicates summonses for rule violations, and imposes fines, and suspends or revokes licences, where appropriate. No new taxi licence has been issued for over the last 50 years, whereas, about 400 new drivers were licensed each month in 1993 by the TLC. Taxi inspectors stop cabs on the street to check for proper licence, and issue summonses when they find rule violations or unsafe conditions.

**3.1.2.3 Deregulation.**

The Act also created a mechanism under which the city could issue additional vehicle licences after a deliberative adminitrative process. This provision, which some critics of the Act have ignored, was never exercised and was removed in a 1971 rewrite of the law. When the city failed to expand the taxi industry despite post-World War II economic growth, taxicab licences developed a trading value in the open market. After four decades of often-explosive increases, individually-owned licences now trade at $155,000 and fleet licences at $220,000 each.

TLC legalized leasing in 1979, so that nearly all fleet drivers became lessees by the mid 1980s. Moreover, leasing practices have been stable among fleets since the mid 1980s. On the other hand, many of minifleets (in which two drivers jointly created a corporation, each driver operate a taxicab owning one-half of the stock) were born by selling fleets-owned meda11ions to individuals in the early 1970s and increased to 4,700 in 1981. For the purpose of the Haas Act, these were still ""fleet"" licences since they were owned in groups of two or more, however, operationally, they looked and acted like owner-drivers. Nearly all those minifleets were not operated by the owner-driver, but operated by other drivers at the end of the 1980s, because they were also leased. The lessee typically arranged with another driver to operate a second shift for a few hours, so called “subleasing"". By 1993 the method of leasing changed to such a method that minifleet lessors lease to two full-time drivers separately, charging each driver a leasing fee. Individual owners began to follow the same course as minifleet owner-drivers in the mid 1980s, so that only 52% of individually-owned cabs were owner-driven by 1990. TLC adopted a rule, effective in 1990. to preserve owner-driving and return the individual medallion licence to the original 1937 concept. As a result, three-quarters of all individual cabs are now owner-driven. Under the lease arrangement, a driver pays the taxi owner a flat amount for each shift or each week. The driver then has exclusive use of the cab for that period of time. Owners are guaranteed the lease fee for each shift (or week) the cab is leased, regardless of how much time the driver actually works or how much money the driver takes in. Drivers' earnings are the difference between their total revenues (fares and tips) and their expenses {lease fees and gasoline).

New York City recently established a plan to auction 400 plates during 1996-1997 for the purpose of helping budget deficit, which would be the first issue of medallion since 1937. In consequence, 53 owner-driver and 80 fleet medallions were auctioned in May 1996 at $170,000-$177,000 for each owner-driver medallion, and at $210,000-$221,000 for each fleet medallion respectively.

The criteria were *pretty* clear, but I say that as a student of law. It was an appalling situation to force doctors to have to make incredibly important legal judgments in the course of providing perhaps emergency medical attention. 

Our Constitution provides that the ""unborn"" has a right to life which is equal to the right to life of the mother to be. Therefore, abortions are *generally* unconstitutional. The Supreme Court clarified this by ruling that abortions are permissible where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother (it was as liberal as they could be, given the wording of the text, and they were presented with the case of a pregnant 14 year old rape victim), since the mother's death implies the death of the ""unborn"" too.

So the situation is as follows: abortion *must* be allowed where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, *and* abortion is not permissible in *any* other circumstance. As you can see, there's essentially no wiggle room. This law just sets out the framework for how doctors should go about granting abortions in this limited circumstance, and attempts to clarify the situation a little. That's all.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;The whole idea of purifying pain is something I find repugnant and not based on reality. 

I don't know if I believe in puryfying pain, seems rather oldfashioned idea, but I do belive (on a personal level mind you) in that one should sometimes feel guilt for what one has done, and generally try to fix things then. I think it works on several levels, one acknowledges that one has fucked up, and one gets to fix things. Both smart. I don't believe in shame though. Guilt is for things you have done - we have all fucked up. Shame is for what you *are*. That is just wrong and counter productive. No one can change that, and shouldn't. 

&gt;The problem is that you take the fucked up system and you use it as a justification for the current suffering.

The problem with you is that you take the (very) bad effect from the Euro, the most imperfect of currencies, and attribute it to other Eurostates, in the belief that they are trying to make you suffer. Believe me, the Finns are not trying to make more of the Greeks unemployed, nor are the Dutch wanting Greek children to go hungry. The huge unemployement numbers that is  the far biggest issue (I mean, if everyone had a job to go to and each family two salaries, things would be far, far better in Greece) is not due to the austerity, but due to the effects of the Euro. 

That is what happens when too diverse economies join in one currency. You could see this in the merging of the two Germanys as well, in the early 90's. However, even if you had the same unemployment numbers there in parts of the (former) DDR, the German state balanced that by a) keeping a social safety net and paying for schools, hospitals, pensions etc b) enormous investments c) keeping the banks/paying off DDR's debt etc d) more DDR people moving 

None of that is happening in Greece, nor will it, which is one of the many reason I think Greece should leave Euro. 

That however, is the absolutely biggest reason for the Greek suffering, not the austerity measures. 

&gt;""Greece is fucked up, therefore the Greeks deserve all the suffering they are getting now

That is the problem again. Greece *is* fucked up, and you need to fix those part of your society, in or outside of the Euro - corrupt societies are notoriously bad at being competitive and working.  *But* a lot of the suffering comes from being in the Euro. That is not a punishment, that is a choice (bad one, in my opition) you have made. You are punishing yourself. So, leave. 



&gt;e have reached the point that a lot of people are not paying their taxes because they can't afford it. Do you have any idea what that means?

Hmm- we don't have that system, since our most basic taxes are paid before I get my salary, so no, I don't. Your system seems very weird to me.  As to my understanding, the Greeks choose not to build up a system like us, since the Greeks didn't want to pay taxes. The average 50 year old Greek have paid far, far, less in taxes (and still does btw) than the average Dutch or Finn in his/her lifetime. So, I don't really see the pain of taxes in Greece. It seems to me like you think of taxes differently than we do. 

What kind of service do you expect when you pay little in taxes, and a notorious for cheating on them? What state do you think can be built for that? 

That said, I know the Greeks are suffering, but I think a majority of that suffering do not come from the austerity measures (that frankly, Greece, haven't been the best to follow through on anyway) but from the internal devaluation which follows the Euro (which is crap, as I have said). 


&gt;There are three problems here. One is corruption. The current political elites are very corrupt and they won't throw out their supporters even if they're also corrupt and inefficient.

So, fight it. Nothing will change until the Greeks start doing that. Anyway - the logic that you should not fire anyone because you have such corrupt politicians hardly stands. 

&gt;Third, there's a humanitarian aspect. Greece is currently almost completely lacking a social safety net. So, these ""undesirables"", instead of being given a new chance at life, they are marginalised and pauperised. 


If Greece want to pay for inefficient people, that is fine. You have been doing that for decades. However, when you *have* promised to fire people, you should keep you promises. Furthermore, as long as you are paying for them with other peoples money (Finnish people for example) I honestly don't see how you can justify keeping people. 



The Greek and the Greek society seems very strange to me. It seems like everyone cheats on everyone, from politicians, to bribing the tax man. There is no faith in society, and institutions. I guess that is fine if the Greeks want it that way, but then one should realise it is extremely hard to compete with and function as a highly industrialised nation. I guess, one has to choose. One can't have it both ways. 


My suggestion is to start paying taxes, fight the corruption and leave the Euro.

No planning, my wife and I just drove all the way to Denmark and toured the country for a dozen of days. So the following could be a little biased.

* Copenhagen has an interesting architecture, a lively compact city center, good shops and restaurants, and great museums. It's probably my favorite European capital. But I think that Tivoli gardens are overrated. 

* Outside Copenhagen, I especially enjoyed Ribe, Aarhus, and Skagen.

* Skagen was famous in the 19th century for the brightness of its light, and it attracted many painters, who created the Skagen School. The most important is [P.S. Krøyer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peder_Severin_Kr%C3%B8yer). I bought several prints of the Skagen painters and they still hang in my home and in my office.

* In Skagen you can observe [two seas colliding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIWJhyC-pYE), the Skagerrak and the Kattegat, a rather unusual sight.

* The Jutland coast is windy and it has moving sand dunes. One famously buried an old church, so that only the belltower is now visible: [the Tilsandede Kirke](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Den_tilsandede_kirke_i_Skagen_2007_ubt.jpeg)

* Famous Danes include 17th century king Christian IV, the philosopher Kierkegaard, the author Hans Christian Andersen, the physicist Niels Bohr, and the film director Lars von Trier. EDIT: I forgot the 19th century sculptor Thorvaldsen, the museum dedicated to him in Copenhagen is impressive.

* Egeskov Castle is one of Europe's finest and best preserved fortified residences, and [the setting is breathtaking](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Egeskov_Slot_spejling_Edit_2.jpg).

* Helsingør castle, of Hamlet's fame, is interesting but a little empty. I liked Frederiksborg Castle more. Rosenborg Castle and the Royal Treasure in Copenhagen are also a must see.

* Danish pipe makers are renowned for their craftsmanship, and their briar smoking pipes command premium prices.

* Danish history is turbulent, and Danish monarchs used to rule on Norway, Greenland, and part of Sweden. The dialect spoken in the Swedish region of Skåne is still closer to Danish than to Swedish. Denmark also had colonies in Africa and possibly elsewhere.

Yeah, we do. In the area around the border with Germany in Jutland there is a Danish minority on the German side ~~and (I believe) a German minority on the Danish side~~. The Danish claim is that Germany conquered territory from us way back in the 19th century and we want it back, in part because there are Danes living in the area, so obviously it's ours....or something like that.

Anyway, it's not a hot dispute, just a source of mutual irritation.
