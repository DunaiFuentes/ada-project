(b) your obstacles:

       Norway export energy to the EU, not manufactured goods.
       Resources are easier to move than manufactured products.

Don't sell the UK short on this by any means.  

The UK's economy has developed very much differently in recent years from the European norm.  The UK's service industry has boomed respective to goods.  Resources may be easier to move than product, but services doubly so.

       UK has some of these energy resources, sure, but not 
       close to the level of Norway;

Add to that the UK is going to have to deal with its own looming decade electricity deficit, which it is in the process of approaching.  Scotland, (who I don't for a second will end up going down the independence route because the campaign is being so poorly run) is already positioning itself as a green energy exporter (and is already a net producer of electricity in talks to begin exporting).  The UK *is* set to be a world leader in next generation nuclear energy, and does have fracking, even more Falkland's oil discoveries on the way (some world size viable fields now having been found).  The UK also has Greenland licenses to off shore finds and an Arctic presence in  Cairn Energy, it also has Antarctic claim.  Energy and Space communication is where the UK is beginning to tip its hat to join finance as a jewel in the crown.

As far as UK manufacturing does go it all tends to be very high end top spec and innovative stuff, so stack it high and move it cheap isn't really an order of the day.

All in all, two obstacles in, movement's not really an issue in that regard, and of course, the UK has other fingers in other pies where just Norway has an energy gateau.

       Norway contribute a huge amount of money to the EU... 

And speaking as a sceptic that ideally wants a much pared down second tier to remain in but decidedly holds anti-EU feelings, I would have no issue with paying a scaled up contribution in the region of what Norway pays to get what the 1994 European Economic Area Agreement provides, of which the UK is already a signatory, outside Lisbon and whether they are in the EU or not.

       If controlled to the Rotterdam Effect, UK export to the 
       EU is still 40%.

Woah there.  Gonna have to call source on that because no-one can agree what the true scale of the Rotterdam Effect is (or for that true matter the Lichtenstein Effect that's been in the news recently), but 40% is in the *upper* quartile.  

This is one of the main problems Europe faces.  Nobody actually knows or can categorically pin the scale of the effective to any reasonable margin of error.  The real answer is: nobody knows, but they do know that trade outside the EU is where the growth is and the Rotterdam Effect is spread across every entry point in Europe, and where Britain is an island in the top left corner.

Remember too, the UK outside of Rome, Maastricht and Lisbon treaties is also *already* a signatory of the 1994 EEA Agreement.

       Why? Because if the UK leaves the EU, don't you think 
       Germany + France will want to make an example of them? 
       They would know it'd be imperative that no other country 
       leave, especially right away. 

No, I don't think that for two reasons.  One because it would only serve to crash the European economy at the same time, which they've manacled themselves and their currency too, and the UK as a legal member of the single market would still  be a major net contributor.  So, no, there's not going to be any puerile playground behaviour because it serves nobody.  

The second reason is because placing tariffs under the 1994 Act outside the Lisbon Treaty would be illegal under Article 57, and both France and Germany also signed that act.  Everybody in the EFTA and the former EEC did, in fact, except Switzerland.

So Switzerland already outside the EU and EEA may *legally* choose to place said tariffs on the UK if they pulled out of the EU and Lisbon.  Nobody else continental wise.  And given Switzerlands penchant for all things financial, I don't that'll happen either.",0,1357286685,null,0,false,0,c7qt8zm,t3_15w5m6,t1_c7qt8zm,t1_c7qnt9i,null,1430852115,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Rule of thumb: When people cite percentages, ask for an actual figure, when someone cites a figure, ask for a percentage.

If he paid 140 million in taxes over his lifetime but took 1.4 billion in revenue over the same period, he got of more lightly than most people who don't make anywhere near that amount (10% global tax rate).

140 out of 300 (~50%) would be about standard for a  middle class family. Considering his wealth, he's probably well into the regressive part of our tax system, which would put him nearer 30% total taxation (140m would equate to 420m total revenue).

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;I am happy to say, though, that I have provided you with enough explained reasoning to justify my basic positions, and that you're simply ignoring it.

No, you didn't. You just give one example of inevitable exclusive use and assert that that exclusive use extends to everything, always. That's an extremely broad statement and the burden is on you to prove it.

I'll give a counterexample of something that must be in common use: the means of communication. Exclusive use is therefore not a universal principle. I won't be as daft to claim that *everything* must be in common use just because I gave one example.

&gt;I'll accept your translation and summary if it's remembered in the context of my pointing out that you're acting as quite the authoritarian by supposing your sense of value be forced on everyone else...

Straw man, I never did. I just refuse to let you dictate the terms of valuation in society.

&gt;instead of letting people figure out what they reckon their time, effort, etc, are worth among themselves.

There are other ways to attribute value to things than the market.

&gt;Oh no, not at all. If I've understood you correctly, I completely accept that the circumstances of anyone's existence in a lot of ways are completely down to dumb luck. I'm just not concerned by it and don't understand why you would be. There's nothing to rationalise about something which by your own admission is inherently non-rational, is arbitrary, is malleable, is inconsistent.

You misunderstand: it's not just the random details, but also the fundamental needs of persons are determined by the circumstances of their origin. There's no reason to assume that everything can be most effectively handled by just the principle of property.

&gt;No, I'm not. I'm treating the idea of ""personhood"" as a variable. The only thing you can really accuse me of assuming is that there is this variable...but why would you do that? At a minimum persons are humans (the subject of our discussion) and you surely wouldn't want to deny their existence.

Then you still have to define the range of that variable, otherwise the word person means nothing.

&gt;You don't think I'm thinking clearly about this subject either.

But stating so doesn't contribute to the discussion in any way, on the contrary.

&gt;If nobody wants to uphold them, that's perfectly acceptable, just so long as they don't actively violate them.

Suppose someone violates them. What happens?

&gt;For example, Person A doesn't have to come to B's aid when they're robbed by C. But If A was to rob B, that would be inconsistent with A's abidance to property rights.

That doesn't stop it from happening.

&gt;I just think the world (and the overwhelming weight of human history does support this...) will make its most progress (in terms of gaining more and better quality goods and services, at lower cost, effort, time) the closer humanity does adhere to principles of private property and free markets.

I can accept that as your belief, but not your logicalities to support it.

&gt;nd the overwhelming weight of human history does support this...

The overwhelming weight of human history shows that the kind of absoluteness that you espouse is particularly unstable and won't last.

On the subject of eating with friends - I take a different approach. I don't have direct experience with vegetarian/vegan requests, but the way I see it - if you're eating with friends then the host should make something which *everyone* can eat. It's about being a good host. If people are griping that there's no meat in the dish then maybe you need to re-think who you're eating dinner with. I don't go to eat dinner with muslim friends and request pork with a red-wine reduction. A little extreme, but you see my point. If said muslim friends came to dine at my place I would ensure that the meat I was using had come from a halal source and I had properly researched haram additives in food.

My mother is a life-long vegetarian and when her and my father are eating with friends they're always eating vegetarian, even though 3 out of the 4 people round the table are meat-eaters. It reduces stress about thinking of extra dishes to prepare, and at least for die-hard meat eaters, expands their horizons a bit.

&gt;UK firms have become obsessed with Europe – unlike, paradoxically, members of the Eurozone. IMF data analysed by Citigroup suggest that UK exports of goods to emerging economies was worth 3.4 per cent of our national income last year, a smaller share than all other EU-15 member states. Even Greece exports relatively more.

&gt;Britain’s exports to China have surged 11 per cent a year over the past decade, which sounds good until one realises that everybody else has been doing even better. Switzerland has increased its own exports to China by 25 per cent a year, and now sells more to it than Britain does, even though the UK’s GDP is four times larger than Switzerland’s. In 2011, the UK’s exports of goods to Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Cyprus were worth exactly the same as our combined exports to the biggest 10 emerging markets. This is a monstrous miscalculation.

I can't find anything more recent than 2003/2004, which is a disappointment but back then the EU imposed a tariff of c. 6.7% on its imports compared to 2.7% for the US and 2.0% for Japan.

Since the revenues from these import duties flow into the general EU budget, which seems to be forever growing I don't suspect the tariffs are much less now.

And bear in mind the heaviest tariffs are imposed on food and the UK probably imports more of that than, say France and running a balance of trade deficit as the UK does the burden of these tariff's probably falls more heavily on the UK than say Germany.

So it is probable the advantages of EU critical mass will be more than offset in a reduction of UK costs if the UK were to leave the EU.

After the constitutional court's decision the government reminded the press today that they had the power to go against the decision if they would wanted to because they could modify the constitution about the electoral registration. 

The government has already taken numerous actions to restrict the possibilities of a fair election in 2014 and today's decision helps to prevent their intentions.

Free prend une ""position de force"" vis-à-vis de Google, sur le dos de tous un tas de ""petits"" acteurs du web, les éditeurs de sites web.

Même si Google ne bloque pas les sites aux Freenautes, les webmasters le feront. C'est techniquement très simple, certains le font déjà pour les utilisateurs d'AdBlock. Je ne le fais pas sur mes sites, j'accepte qu'un certain pourcentage des visiteurs bloquent les pubs, parce que ce pourcentage est suffisamment bas pour ne pas mettre le modèle en péril, mais il est évident que si cette proportion augmentait trop [Free représente 15% de mes visiteurs] soit je met la clef sous la porte, soit j’essaie de développer un modèle payant en sachant que pour les sites de pur contenu, c'est quasiment impossible.

If they are aiding and abetting someone to commit tax evasion (and likely circumventing customs restrictions on taking money out of the U.S., just a guess) in the U.S., they are committing a crime in the U.S. - I imagine this opens them up to extradition in many countries.

true,Kit_Emmuorto,vaticano,,"""Prendere un granchio"" - ""to take a crab"" - significa sbagliare qualcosa perché la si è valutata male. L'espressione viene dalla pesca (butti la lenza sul fondale, qualcosa abbocca e inizia a strattonare, tu tiri su tutto contento perché pensi sia un pesce e invece, fregatura, hai preso un granchio) ed è protagonista, già che di questo stiamo parlando, di uno dei più begli episodi di traduzione degli [idiotismi](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiotismo) nella storia dell'umanità.

**SEGUE RICCO SPOILER DI DIECI PICCOLI INDIANI**

La settima strofa della filastrocca (Quattro poveri negretti / salpan verso l'alto mar: / uno se lo prende un granchio, / e tre soli ne restar) è il punto centrale della trama: il morto della strofa in questione morto non è, e l'unica traccia lasciata dall'assassino per far capire che le cose non stanno come sembra è proprio questa strofa. Che nella versione originale recita come segue: Four little Soldier Boys / going out to sea; / A red herring swallowed one / and then there were three. 

E qui cominciano i problemi: red herring letteralmente significa aringa rossa, ma sopratutto è [il modo di dire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring) per indicare qualcosa che, volontariamente o meno, costituisce un indizio. Per il traduttore è un bel problema: dovendo tenere l'ambientazione marittima (il tizio in questione dovrà comunque affogare), devi fare in modo di far capire che c'è l'inghippo inventandoti il sistema per tradurre una cosa che traducibile non è. L'espediente del granchio trovato dal traduttore italiano, oltre ad essere estremamente brillante, prende punti bonus per essere un idiotismo a sua volta.

From that point, leading up to the slap... It appears that the ambassador was more or less trying to proceed with her family while being told not to and blocked by the female officer with her arm. Since the slap happened (assaulting a police officer), the 'manhandling' involved arresting someone who is resisting arrest. Obviously, I think the police officers could have handled this a bit better, but it doesn't change the fact that the ambassador believed that the rules don't apply to her.

As far as taking her shoes off, I've had to recently take my shoes off while visiting Ireland. I believe it has to do with the type of shoes you are wearing and if you can easily hide something in them. In this case, she was wearing boots. Boots can easily hide a few objects. In fact, one pair of shoes I was wearing was x-rayed in Canada because it had quite a large hollow part on the sole.

true,g99,HUNG,Magyarország,"Well, it's a long story.

After Fidesz (the current governing party) lost the elections in 2006 they tried everything to weaken MSZP (the socialist party who ruled previously). In 2006 a speech was recorded and leaked from MSZP's party congress where the PM said they had lied to their voters. Enourmous public outrage broke out, people put cars on fire, fought against the police. This was a very good opportunity for Fidesz to weaken MSZP more and more, and MSZP's ruling was quite incompetent to begin with, and Fidesz tried to oppose to everything MSZP said. In 2009, PM Gyurcsány resigned and Bajnai became the new PM. He was more like an economical expert than a politician, he started the reforms the EU was expecting and things were getting better compared to the first wave of the recession in 2008. 

In 2010 Fidesz won 51% of the votes in the elections which translates to 68% of the seats in the Parliament so they gained absolute majority. I was concerned about their agressive past rhetorics but I thought they deserved a chance. But to be honest, in retrospect I regard this past 2 years the worst since I follow politics (late 90s). 

Fidesz wrote a new constitution without the consent of the rest. They did many many things to cement their power. They tried to restrict the press, control cultural life, they redesigned voting districts for their own benefit, they put their own loyal strawmen to almost every important position, almost every tender is won by firms related to the goverment and so on. Corruption got worse, as they don't even try to conceal their ways doing it. 

The minister of economics is simply a lunatic. He is the most incompetent person in this position I have ever seen. They call their methods ""unorthodox"", they say they are ""writing the book of future economics"" and always go against the EU. They say they are ""economical freedom fighters"". They changed almost every aspect of the economy without waiting for the effects of other changes. And they communicate that things couldn't be better, Hungary will be an economical wonder in the near future. Meanwhile, every statistics shows that we are on the same level as we were in 2008 when the recession started. The government said that in 2012 and 2013 the positive effects of their economical strategy could be clearly seen. Instead, analysts say that we still need at least 3 years to return to the path of economical growth but only if the government stops their so called unorthodox strategy. The government's communication is always overly optimistic but they are always proven wrong. They managed to bring our budget deficit under 3% but they took the pension savings of the people for this and they seem to struggle to keep the deficit under 3% next year even with the huge tax increase they did yet they still communicate everything they did was perfect. 

Investors need economical stability and seeing this whole process, they feel that Hungary is not the best place for their investments anymore. The government is hostile towards foreign corporations and broke promises to them several times.

Meanwhile migration from the country to other EU members is sky-rocketing.

Which human rights suffer from freedom of trade?

&gt;Yes, but it wasn't for a while. The right crept in quickly and here we are.

Nonsense, they're in the mess they're now because of how poorly governed they were and because their state tried to provide everything for everyone.

If they value their democracy and their freedom and defend it against those who'd seize power from them and rule over them and decide for the Argentinians what's good for the Argentinian people, then they'll fail just like countries always fail when someone seizes power (be it in name of equality or order or whatever) and tries to impose his will on everybody else.

&gt;No, it's not that. That's extreme anarchy, which isn't leaning to any political wing. And it doesn't have to have small authority. It just has to maintain institutions that preserve basic human rights, even if that means asking a fair share from the wealthy to do so.

If it's just that, then whole of the free world already fills that criteria, countries like ours have institutions that preserve human rights and tax the wealthy (and everybody else).

&gt;Can you not look around in Portugal?

Yes, and all the problems I see were caused by excessive public spending defended by the left. Saying the socialists will fix them when they've only managed to bury us even deeper in just stupid.

Heck, look at the rest of Europe, which are the countries in troubles and which ones are fine? Why is that the countries in trouble are the ones that tried to provide everything to everyone like the socialists did and the ones that are fine are those which have had typical centre-right governments which managed to keep their expenditures down?

&gt;Can you not identify the social problems arising from senseless cuts

Yes, because taxes aren't being cut at the same time. If we cut spending but keep taxes as they are on increase taxes, then it's obvious that families will have an harder time, but it's currently a necessity because for too long it was the other way around, the taxes being paid weren't enough to cover the spending.

I guarantee you that these cuts in public spending would be painless if taxes were also reduced.

&gt;socialism of the banks

Right, and he should have a stronger justice system to prevent our banks from ever needing bailouts. Bailout are, in of itself, against the free market, the only reason the state has intervened was because if the banks failed, the economy would fail to, and it's certainly not the fault of the people who deposited their money in banks like BPP.

&gt;priviledges to the ultra wealthy

What? The rich already are so massively taxed here and it's not like we even have many of those!

I'd ever favouring lowering taxes to everyone but specially to the rich, if we could get the French and the Spanish millionaires to move here, that would in itself pay off more than the revenue we'd lose by lowering the rates. Also, they'd bring their money here and would spend it here, helping our economy recover.

&gt;Those are the troubles the west is facing today. Too much greed and corruption is turning the free market into the fascist market, which always brings its nasty helper - misery and no human rights to the people.

No, you're confusing cause and effect. People have always been greedy and have always tried to game the system in their favour, it's part of whom we are, you can't say ""oh, the people in socialist states are more generous than the people in capitalistic countries"", that's utter nonsense, it's not because of freedom of trade and allowing people to choose for themselves what they want to buy or sell or what they should produce or commercialise that we're having the problems we currently have.

&gt;The free market can solve these problems even less than tried leftwing policies have.

The problems of people always wanting more? If that's a problem, then it's one which will always persist, regardless of time and place and politics.

&gt;Time to try new ones, time to try substantial change that hits the core of our civilization, which some mistake for 'human nature'.

That's sure to fail like it always did. Heck, even the most devout religious people fail to not be selfish, and they might really believe in heaven and hell, if even them can't always want more from themselves, what makes you think that people will one day be able to share and live as if we were only one family?

So cutting our public spending is a mistake? When should we cut our public spending then? If 100% debt to GDP apparently isn't enough, should we strive for 150%? 175%? 200%? 300%?

What will happen when people stop loaning us money because we clearly can't pay, will we then stop all spending and crash simply because we couldn't keep our expenditures at a reasonable level?

I'm honestly curious because it seems clear to everyone that our public spending is unsustainable and yet people say we can't tax more to pay for it and they also say we can't lower the public spending we already have.

http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/zombie-borders/

&gt;For one of the most remarkable examples of this revenant quality of former borders, we need only hop across the Oder-Neisse line to Poland. On the map of post-communist Poland’s election results, one curious division keeps cropping up: the old imperial border between Russia and Prussia/Germany, as it existed when Poland did not, from 1848 to 1918.[...]

&gt;The fit between modern election result and ancient border is almost perfect. But how can this be? The ethnic composition of the region has been shaken up thoroughly since the border last was in effect: following the Second World War, Germans were expelled from areas east of the Oder-Neisse line, and Poles moved in from former Polish areas to the east, now annexed by the Soviet Union.

&gt;Yet in spite of these completely different demographics, the former border keeps resurfacing at Polish national elections – a zombie border indeed. Earlier treatment of this question [10] has offered up a few intriguing hypotheses: The resettled Poles haven’t had the time yet to “get conservative”; the newer Polish areas have richer farmland (or a denser rail network), are thus more likely to have liberal politics. But an answer that fits the question as snugly as the old border fits contemporary election results remains elusive.

&gt;It may seem overly deterministic to link modern election results to ancient borders that no longer exist; but similar claims have been made about election outcomes in France, Ukraine and the United States, to name but a few countries.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;First of all, austerity is increasing our debt as a percentage of GDP

Wut? Austerity means cutting public spending, cutting public spending leads to a reduction of the deficits which help bringing down the debt.

&gt;so if you keep doing it you will soon reach your 300% as our GDP continues rock sliding.

If our GDP is falling it's because our environment isn't business friendly, we need to lower taxes, reduce bureaucracy and reform the justice system to allow it to grow again.

While we do none of this and instead just cut spending without cutting taxes, then it's obvious that the GDP will fall, but no worries, when the deficits go down, there will also be room for lowering taxes and allow the economy to grow again.

&gt;So if you don't think 300% is desirable you should want to change the current strategy. 

Cutting public spending =&gt; greater public debt? What the fuck?

Are you one of those people that say the avoid lung cancer by smoking 5 packs a day?

&gt;Also, you seem to think that a country is like a company or a household.

I do?

&gt;It isn't, the same way the multiplier works for austerity it works for spending too.

The same way the multiplier works for spending, it works for the taxes that require to pay for it in the first place.

&gt;You can increase revenue by spending more. 

And you'll spend more on what? Education? Healthcare? Infrastructure? Industry? Social benefits? How the fuck will spending more on this actually benefit the economy? And how will you even afford more spending? By asking even more loans? By taxing even more?

&gt;That said, this would never work if Portugal did it alone, as we are a very small economy worldwide, in the Eurozone and we don't control our currency.

So the rest of Europe should pay for our circus, no questions asked?

&gt;And yes we obviously need reforms. 

Such as?

&gt;What is needed is an European wide stimulus, if necessary financed by the ECB itself.

If your solution is putting the rest of Europe paying for this, they might not exactly feel inclined to help.

Also, that's exactly what the IMF is doing, lending us money below market rates while overseeing the structural reforms to prevent us from getting into this kind of debt in the future.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, austerity is needed to some degree. However it shouldn't be as much in the taxes but more in the so called ""government fats"". Let's face it, no matter where you are in the political spectrum, you have to agree the Portuguese state is not very efficient. We have useless organism, redundant organisms, excessively funded organisms that apply such fundings incompetently (and suspiciously), and a lot of unnecessary bureaucracy that doesn't help the economy. The promised reforms would hit this. This would be the ""good austerity"". And I hope they will be delivered. Eventually.

Of course some of the ""bad austerity"" is also needed for deficit. Reducing the deficit is important. However, all signs point that we are pushing the ""bad austerity"" too far (specially on the middle/lower-middle class), as the tax revenue is clearly falling and the budgets targets will probably not be achieved in the first trimester. Something is wrong with the current model and needs fixing.

A different solution requires some change in the European Union. The ""troika"" (through different paths) are pushing this model of too much ""bad austerity"", and the government doesn't have much choice (although the reforms could be coming up more consistently, just saying...). No, the European Union shouldn't pay for our mess. But a more ""growth"" oriented (I hate this expression, aren't all economic models ""growth oriented""? But you know what I'm talking about) on Europe's part would probably benefit everyone (France may not look so good for long...) and would be more efficient solving our situation.

Of course some austerity is needed. And Portugal doesn't have much choice right now (follow the memo's not great ideas or rip it and sink in God-knows-what), assuming the (good) reforms are coming (I like to remain optimistic). So it is on the hands of Europe how to deal with us.

Germany may not have been subjected to an equivalent mess as the Treaty of Versailles after WW2, but they did lose huge chunks of historically German land, and around 14 million Germans had to move after the war, with around 2 million dying as a result of the move (essentially trying to escape, or often being forced out of, Russian controlled lands).

Why did they make a plan for spending 40 bn € on military equipment in 2006?

If greece politicians make these deals, it's not really germany's fault, but the fault of greece's corrupt politicians and the so called elite. I bet the german military manufactures would love to sell to other countries too, but their politicians don't buckle.

The corruption has to end, and the morale to pay taxes has to rise. No money of the world will help greece if this does not change.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Well, austerity is needed to some degree. However it shouldn't be as much in the taxes but more in the so called ""government fats"".

That's the thing, austerity is not about taxes! Austerity is, by definition, ""a policy of deficit-cutting by lowering spending via a reduction in the amount of benefits and public services provided"".

Saying that austerity is or can be about taxes is outright wrong. Just because we're implementing both measures of cutting public spending and increasing public revenues, that doesn't mean they're both austerity.

Both austerity policies and tax increases are being used to balance our fiscal budget though they're very different things.

&gt;Let's face it, no matter where you are in the political spectrum, you have to agree the Portuguese state is not very efficient.

Precisely. We need to downsize it to both reduce its expenses and make it more focused on the issues that actually matter to governance.

&gt;We have useless organism, redundant organisms, excessively funded organisms that apply such fundings incompetently (and suspiciously), and a lot of unnecessary bureaucracy that doesn't help the economy. The promised reforms would hit this. This would be the ""good austerity"". And I hope they will be delivered. Eventually.

Exactly.

&gt;Of course some of the ""bad austerity"" is also needed for deficit. Reducing the deficit is important. However, all signs point that we are pushing the ""bad austerity"" too far (specially on the middle/lower-middle class), as the tax revenue is clearly falling and the budgets targets will probably not be achieved in the first trimester. Something is wrong with the current model and needs fixing.

That's not ""bad austerity"" as that's not even austerity at all!

Raising the tax burden on everyone, specially on the middle income taxpayers, that does help the state reduce its deficit but that comes at a great expense for society, it's a very bad trade-off between the public budget of today and the economic growth of tomorrow, not to mention the great burden on the families and how it's essentially admitting defeat in reducing spending since it's opting to instead raise public revenue.

Personally, I strongly oppose this, it's very harmful to the competitiveness for our economy and what the state is collecting more in taxes today, it's less that it will collect in taxes tomorrow as businesses here become increasingly uncompetitive and are fail to survive in the European and global market against companies working in countries with lower tax rates.

&gt;A different solution requires some change in the European Union. The ""troika"" (through different paths) are pushing this model of too much ""bad austerity"", and the government doesn't have much choice (although the reforms could be coming up more consistently, just saying...). No, the European Union shouldn't pay for our mess. But a more ""growth"" oriented (I hate this expression, aren't all economic models ""growth oriented""? But you know what I'm talking about) on Europe's part would probably benefit everyone (France may not look so good for long...) and would be more efficient solving our situation.

I'm with you 100%.

&gt;Of course some austerity is needed. And Portugal doesn't have much choice right now (follow the memo's not great ideas or rip it and sink in God-knows-what), assuming the (good) reforms are coming (I like to remain optimistic). So it is on the hands of Europe how to deal with us.

Yes, this is the thing, we don't have much of a choice. We must at least first balance our budget and stop presenting the deficits we had and then, together with the EU, work to reduce our debt back to acceptable levels.

Sure it won't be easy, but there's no other way out of this, the spending that took place during Socrates government must be paid back, regardless of whom remains in the country.",1,1357333660,null,0,false,0,c7r3iek,t3_15y6hj,t1_c7r3iek,t1_c7r0wfu,null,1435650035,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;What you are essentially suggesting is that riche cons should decide their tax rate themselves, since they can always threaten to leave and having them leave means no taxes at all. 

I suggested that? Please tell me where.

I'm just saying that 50% of some millions is more than 100% of nothing (or 0% of some billions).

&gt;According to your logic, I could essentially threaten the state I live in to allow me to pay only 1 EUR in taxes, since I will leave if they want me to pay more than that. So it is better for them to let me pay only 1 EUR then to get nothing if I leave.

And, according to the logic which you say is mine (though it isn't), the state could tell you to fuck off and leave since you cost the state more than 1€ to keep around. Also, the state knows there's no country where you'll be able to pay 1€ in taxes and since you can't become stateless, I guess you have to choose a country in which to pay taxes and all of them charge more than that.

&gt;""Pay what you want"" is not how taxes work.

Exactly, it isn't, but it also doesn't work like ""pay 75% or else"", as by then most people go with ""or else"" and move somewhere where the rate is more acceptable, making the state that wanted to charge 75% lose 100%.",0,1357334236,null,0,false,0,c7r3p95,t3_15yblw,t1_c7r3p95,t1_c7r20im,null,1430857337,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;I'm not against your brand of austerity.

Austerity isn't a brand nor does with different flavours.

""In economics, austerity refers to a policy of deficit-cutting by lowering spending via a reduction in the amount of benefits and public services provided.""

If someone labels austerity as tax increases or as something else, then they're either mistaken or trying to fool you, that's not what austerity is.

&gt;The austerity we are doing is effectively ruining our GDP in both the short and the long term.

Because we're simply cutting spending and not doing anything else (not liberalising the market, not slashing bureaucracy, still not privatising several state-owned companies, not cutting taxes)?

You're right, we're not doing that and we should. Though, this isn't related to austerity, it's related to the promotion of growth.

&gt;So stop defending an imaginary austerity.

You're the one which has the labels mixed up. For example, when the in the news they mention ""new austerity measures"" and then talk about tax increases, that's not austerity nor do I support that.

&gt;I am obviously speaking about the austerity effectively being practiced in Europe, I'm not arguing semantics about what austerity means. 

Well, semantics matter, if I say the a-word and you say the a-word and this word is being used with different meanings, then it gets confusing. I say we go by the books and define things properly, so when you say austerity is this and it is wrong, I'll tell you austerity isn't that and it's actually beneficial.

Though you're right, we're doing a lot of things labelled as austerity which are very stupid and will harm us on the long run.

&gt;You seem to think I want Europe to pay for more stuff here. I thought it was clear that what I want is for the well off European countries to follow more expansionary policies, perhaps helped by an European wide lending mechanism, coupled with the kind of ""austerity"" you defend here.

You're the one asking for ECB help. The help is coming and more will come, though they need to get some guarantees just like anyone would.

We must give them those guarantees, we must balance our budget and we must stabilise a bit before them coming up and helping us much more in getting us out of this. And for this to happen, the reforms need to be implemented, the more we argue over if austerity is good or not, the more we remain in these quicksand situation and the worse it will be for us in the long run.",0,1357336362,null,0,false,0,c7r4e8r,t3_15y6hj,t1_c7r4e8r,t1_c7r3v4l,null,1430857653,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

There is. There's been some research done on this issue actually. The remarkable thing is that poor people, tending to be less well educated and less politically aware, tend to not realise just how much the state does for them, but tend to have an overly amplified impression of the level of taxation they pay. This results in the poor often feeling like they individually pay lots of tax but receive very little in return (with the perhaps unsurprising feeling that working poor feel the most screwed over by the existence of non-working poor).

This accounts for the right wing economic ideals of people whose best interests would inevitably be served better by voting for left wing parties.

Then there's the fact that in most countries education and wealth correlate positively with social liberalism, and vice versa (this is also tied up in religion, although that's a chicken and egg problem I'll avoid discussion of) - so many poor people are socially conservative, which, in many cases, means that a traditional conservative party which promises to lower taxes and enact socially conservative policy appeals most highly to the very rich social conservatives and working poor people.",0,1357342651,null,0,false,0,c7r6a31,t3_15yhu7,t1_c7r6a31,t1_c7r5ble,null,1430858544,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17

English: violent drunk people (although I must add that this is the bad stereotype about them that mostly applies to younger people, the British expat community is generally respected nowerdays)

Scottish: english

Welsh: english

Irish: english (yeah, not joking.. i've seen an irish person flip tables over this one)

Dutch: weed smokers -- oh and they come from Amsterdam :D

Greeks: gay and/or scammers (""but still better than any other foreigner"") -- also I've heard that greek women are extremely good at sex mentioned quite often. In fact it wouldn't surprise me if the bad stereotypes only apply to the males hehe.

General Eastern Europeans: Alcoholics, Deceitful, Commit Crimes, Take jobs for less money (but the Polish are the first to be mentioned about the jobs, even though there are hardly any of them around compared to the Romanians lets say [2.5k vs 25k+]), Gypsies (Mostly for Romanians and sometimes Bulgarians. Never heard of a polish gypsy stereotype). Since it's a small country that doesn't have a history of a lot of crime, a rise in crime has been observed and a lot of the time it has been eastern europeans -- whether this is factually correct or not, it's enough for the stereotype of committing crimes to stick with most people. (The only ones covered as Eastern European are Romanians, Bulgarians and Polish. The stereotypes do not apply to Czech, Hungarians and Ukrainians, for example, as there aren't many around and nobody talks about them)

Romanians: alcoholics who commit crimes (this is the main stereotype specifically for the romanians other than what is covered under 'General Eastern Europeans').

Turks: Muslims

Muslims: Turks

Scandinavians (in general): beautiful people with money. (I haven't heard any negative stereotypes for them yet)

~~Brazil~~ ~~and~~ Spain: Nice asses on women.

For most of the other countries I can't remember any other stereotype which is repeated often. Even for Germany, there is no average stereotype at all, and I probably hear more good stuff rather than bad stuff. Same with France up to a point.. no general stereotype is applied and generally considered alright -- maybe the odd thing about them avoiding to talk english.

Reminder: These are not the stereotypes that I have assigned. Just stereotypes which I have observed more than average. Since it's a small country, the stereotypes are very dynamic depending on who's around. In the old days, the British probably had the worst stereotype but it died down after Eastern Europeans came along.

Right now the service is a legal disaster due to the many horrible IP laws here. Half the time all you can watch on the stream is a message telling you that ""this program is not available online for legal reasons"". I paid for it. We all did. How can it be illegal to SHOW ME WHAT I PAID FOR?

I mean I'm all for paying your share for educational, informational and cultural programs. I also applaud the reduction of the scary thing called GEZ by making it mandatory and a single flat rate. I wouldn't even mind paying for one or two episodes of the ""Musikantenstadl"" a month, call it cultural and artistic, but how can they argue for maintaining half a dozen soap operas of the same kind (I'm not exaggerating, ""Rote Rosen"", ""Sturm der Liebe"", ""In aller Freundschaft"", ""Verbotene Liebe"" just off the top of my head when the only TV I watch is with my grandma a few times a year)? There is a huge number of extremely local programming as well which I personally could do without. If it wouldn't make a two column newspaper article it's NOT worth a 45min documentary.

The ugly truth is that the boards are infested with politicians and old farts and the non-competitive nature of the service makes it hard to break up that structure. You can't underperform when performance is a factor which can be debated into nothingness and legal obligation. They're overspending by magnitudes and then they depublish what the people paid for effectively reducing the return on it even more. Add to that the general agency problems in this system (local suborganizations which try to keep their funding up) and you have the 7.5 billion(!) in pure lincense fees (2011 data) plus ad revenue plus whatever other sources of income (licensing IP abroad, DVDs, merchandise...) running dry quickly.

Second of all,the countries which are giving less are Spain,Portugal,Ireland,Belgium(excusable as EU institutions are there so skewed data) and the eastern European countries.The reason they are not giving as much,although higher in % of GDP,than the UK is because they don't have as much.That was well known when the UK voted to let them in,together with the rest of the members.They're taking much more in because they're trying to catch up after an awful historical period.",0,1357349557,null,0,false,0,c7r87lv,t3_15yuke,t1_c7r87lv,t1_c7r7o4f,null,1430859508,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

* One of my favorite things about studying abroad in France (I went to Lille last year for a semester and it was incredible) was trying to be a French person. Trying to fit in helped me out a lot; I dressed French (lots of dark colors and scarves, fitted jackets, flats and boots instead of sneakers), spoke French whenever I could (even if it was embarrassing and I butchered it, people still thought it was charming and would help me out), and so forth. French people don't really make eye contact or smile at strangers like we do a lot of the time in America (you might not be American, though, I dunno), which was hard to get used to. When you go into a shop, greet the person working there with a ""Bonjour monsieur/madame"", say please and thank you, and try to get to know the people that work in the shops you visit frequently. They'll be more likely to help you out when you need it.
* If you are kind, patient, and understanding, people will, for the most part, be kind, patient, and understanding back. 
* When you're traveling, be super cautious. Maybe wear a money belt, especially if you're going to carry around lots of cash. Otherwise, keep your wallet in your front pocket, and be aware of it when you're in crowded places like métros and so forth where pickpockets abound. Keep your passport with you at all times. Make some photocopies of it before you leave in case it gets lost or stolen.
* Get a cheap pay-as-you-go phone.
* The bureaucracy there is crazy. Whenever you have any dealings with it (like when you go to get your carte de séjour, when you set up a bank account, when you're getting your healthcare stuff set up, etc.), bring all the paperwork you can possibly think of, check everything eight thousand times, and if you have to submit any paperwork by mail, get started on it early. Be patient and persistent.
* I found that things are more expensive there in general (at least compared to American prices.)
* Declare a médecin traitant (a general doctor) when you set up all of the health care shit. If you ever get sick (which you probably will), it'll save you some money.
* Make French friends! Speak French all the time!
* Pack light. Pack basic clothes that you can mix and match. Bring a pair of comfortable and sturdy but trendy shoes that you could spend hours walking in (because you will walk a lot.) No flip-flops unless you're on the beach, no sneakers unless you're working out. French people dress nice all of the time. 
* Don't make the same mistake as I did: Spend more time getting out and seeing the world and meeting people and less time in the library studying.
* Be flexible. Plan things well, but be prepared for anything. All kinds of crazy shit will happen and nothing will be easy, but it's not supposed to be.

**English:** we (germans) call them island monkeys and that pretty much sums it up. Even the nice civilized tweed wearing kind will turn full monkey once alcohol is involved. They do have nice entertainment though.


**Scots and Irish**: nice and cool people  oppressed by the island monkeys (wales is not really on the radar)



**Italy**: sleazy, unreliable, incompetent, short-tempered but are also quite extroverted ,nice and easygoing.
I would say that italians propably suffer the worst reputation  of all european nations in GER (well at least they did before the financial crisis ). There is a saying that  ''Germans love Italians, but don't respect them. Italians respect Germans, but don't love them.'' And in a way this is true. Germans may be enamoured with the art and the easygoing lifestyle (while on holliday) but there is also little trust in the competence of italians . Hard to say if this is a remnant of WW2 (americans still have their prejudices against the french), or if it is some grudge because we were never be able to beat them in a mayor football tournament. 

**Finland:** great education system, love metall, very introverted



**Portugal:** depressed despite the sunshine, play fado and drink red wine while watching the sun go down and reminisce about everything that went wrong in their lives

**Spain**: temperamental, like to dance and have strange hobbies that are either wasteful and/or harm cows.

**Greece:** pre financial crisis the stereotype was actually quite positive and it was repected as an old civilized culture.
 But since then it went downhill so bad I have trouble remembering what it was before.

**Czechia:** catching up fast with the west. Flexible and ambitious workforce. Great to do pilot projects in.

**Belgium** is hard: even though I live pretty close to the border and some distant part  of my family comes from the Eupen/Malmedy region it is really difficult to come up with a stereotype for them. They are a bit strange, familiar yet slightly different. Like a alternative universe version of french, dutch and germans locked in together in one country. And they hate each other and would like to split as would dutch, french and germans do if they were locked together in one country.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"I always thought ""kalamaraes"" has more to do with calamari tbh.. but most of the time when cypriots talk between them about the ""kalamaraes"", it's ""poushtokalamaraes"". It only becomes ""kalamaraes"" when a kalamaras is present :D

&gt; But in general Greeks and Cypriots feel 99% the same nation, and soon all regret using the stereotypes.

This has generally been the case while I was growing up, but ever since joining the EU they are starting to feel more and more like their own country. The left wing keeps reminding everyone that ""we are a state"", and the mainstream right wing which still refers to the country as the ""Cypriot greekism"" (Kypriakos Ellinismos) more or less deals with the country as being its own state. About the only party (which doesn't have much support) that feels that it's the same nation is ELAM which is aligned with Golden Dawn (which generally scares Cypriots by the way, expect Greece to lose more and more support from cypriots if golden dawn gains any more power over there -- some scary thing in history that happened last time Greece and Cyprus thought about becoming the same nation :P).

So.. In my personal opinion, Cyprus and Greece are more or less becoming just brothers, with Turkey being the abusive uncle and the UK being the godfather who doesn't care :D The similarities between the two countries are mostly language related (which the Cypriots had to butcher a bit as you know) and religion related, and of course a few cultural aspects. Almost every other aspect is way too different to consider them the same nation (they don't drive on the same side of the road, use different electric plugs even -- hell, Cypriots pronounce english way different to greeks). Some time in the near future (hopefully), the Turkish Cypriots will be reunited with the rest of the country. These people are more Cypriot than they are Turkish, so when all is said and done, Cyprus will never be the same nation with Greece or Turkey, ever -- but you will always be our kalamaraes :D

tl;dr: As much as Cyprus and Greece may have wanted to marry eachother (hey, the sex was good, ok? :D) at some point in time, their love is forbidden and will have to find their own way in the future.",0,1357353929,null,0,1357356073,0,c7r9f8o,t3_15ylyg,t1_c7r9f8o,t1_c7r8ztu,null,1435649950,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

However, European skyscrapers aren't targeted at the ""world's tallest"" class as those buildings tend to be fairly impractical and constructed more as attempts to gain prestige than to serve a useful purpose.

Europe already has a wealth of architectural prestige from its classical old cities, and spending a few billion euro on a giant metal penis would probably not make a huge improvement.

Look around the world: the tallest skyscrapers are almost all going up in fairly ugly cities (Dubai, Taipei, Shanghai, etc.) with fast-changing economies. They are competing with each other over who is the most ""dynamic"". This is not a race that Paris needs to be in. Nor would Paris benefit from any more Montparnasses. Instead, they have their tall, dense office buildings in a ghetto at the western edge of the city, while more tourists flock to Paris' skyscraper-less center in a month than Dubai sees in a year.

Mind you, I am not really against the Euro as an idea, but I think it is incorrectly constructed and that has lead to problems for everyone involved. With such different economies for example, one have to accept permanent transfer, huge permanent transfers. I am not really ready to do that, for one thing :-).

Countries are and have been ignoring everything about the Euro really, and nothing has happened that seems to change that. As and example, I'd like to take the way the ECB works. They are not supposed to buy up bonds on the market the way they are, support individual currencies, in effect sponsor individual countries (whoever ""noble"" the reason might be). It is the same with everything really, from supporting countries etc. 

I can understand, to *some* extent, why one is doing this, but these rules were painfully thought out, and voted about, accepted, by almost all the different countries. At some point, one has to start listening and stop ignoring them.

Above all, I can see the need for re-negotiation etc, but that *has* to be done through the proper channels, and let people vote about it. The crises has been going on since at least 2008, one can't blame it on urgency. Now they are being renegotiated through some back door channel, no voting.

All that is actually getting worse. Same with Berlusconi, who is in my mind a super corrupt, power hungry Viagra fueled gnome, but, he was  the choice of the Italians. The EU has no business making him leave, where does it say that? 

Some of it can be blamed on the economy, but in my mind, it is a cheap excuse. The economy is only accentuates problems that were there, didn't invent them.


Another thing is that the Nordic countries are all rather non corrupt. Even statistically, unless we join up with New Zeeland, we are bound to join up with bigger countries, who are more, or a lot more corrupt, unfortunately. One thing I have been following is the ""snus"" debate (a sort of wet tobacco Sweden have a special licence for) where there was bribery, on a high level. Those high official hasn't been charged, and it is not, unfortunately, the first time I read about stuff like that in the EU. 

I also don't really think that the EU would look out for our interest really, they don't really now. Understandably from a population viewpoint, but maybe one shouldn't join then if one has a problem with it. Don't join up and then complain.

That was a national decision. It wasn't the EU that got rid of Berlusconi. He lost a Budget vote, won a confidence vote by the smallest possible amount, then lost a second Budget vote and resigned. That's what usually happens when a PM can't command a majority in his/her Parliament.

Before the 2014 elections, the parties will elect their Presidential Candidates. So far, only the Socialists have set out their framework for doing this, but it will be in a democratic fashion, with ordinary party membership participation as a minimum. PS in France have said they will hold an open primary for their part of this, just like they did when electing Hollande as their candidate. This will mean that each Party will have a face to go with it. Someone who can travel from country to country drumming up support, thus making the election much less based on national issues. The Candidate from the Party that wins the election will become President of the European Commission. In this way, the EU will have become much more like national parliamentary democracies, and it will have been the citizens, not the European Council, who have selected their Head of Government for the EU.

Everthing! Did every country in the Euro get a chance to vote about the new Euro rules? Have the people in all the countries have had their say in the way ECB is acting? Have they had a chance in the bank save, and the coming (unfortunately) more bailouts? Have all they people been able to vote about the new transfers that is now becoming more and more permanent? 

One can't just say, vote on, *and* accept the rule ""each country is responsible for their own debt"", ""no country will pay for someone else"", the ECB will not intervene etc, and then change that, without asking.  It is *huge*.

What is happehning now, is that they are institutionalising transfers (big permanent transfers), and changing the ground rules for the Euro. How can you think it is OK to do that without asking people? No one ever voted yes to that, either in their parlament, or in their their popular votes. Also, remember that other countries are about to join to. You can't tell them that they signed up under the rules A, which they agree to, and then change it to be, without either letting them off the hook (which also demands big legal changes and renegotions of treaties) or *not* changing.

I would have no doubts about it...  
MONTPELLIER!!!! (One of my favourite places in the world)  
I grew up in the South west of France, and spent 4 years in and around Montpellier. I sometimes go back there in order to see some of my friends.
There are a few ""English"" speaking places in the centre of town, they can be useful for the winter blues if ever you feel home sick: The Shakespeare's pub (may still be open), O'Carolans' pub (still open), fitzpatrick's pub (still open)...   
Montpellier has a very active art scene (I should know, I used to take part in it).   
It is a place that I hate, just like Bristol in the U.K., Zurich, Toulouse, Glastonbury (not the pilton festival, the actual place)... The reason I hate those places is because I can't be in all of them at the same time.
I know you will have a great time in France, and will feel a great pain once your 11 months are up.  
In Montpellier, you won't have to try too hard to fit in, there are people from all walks of life there, and you should find yourself being accepted as you are.  
""Mon occitania es métissa!"" is an Occitan sentence showing their local acceptance of others. Montpellier is known as la petite capital (Paris on the Med.)  
I'm sorry to say that since I left, my favourite hang-outs closed. No more ""Le Sax'Aphone"" Jazz club. Yet I can safely say, from the feedback friends give me, that the music scene there is still alive and kicking.
If you go ahead and choose Montpellier, I know for sure that you'll see or hear some of my friends. (A friend works for a local radio, another is active on the hip-hop scene, another on the D'n'B Dubstep scene, another one does minimal techno, another does circuit bending, many do exhibitions, street art,...).  
Montpellier is engulfed in a rich poly-cultural vibe that reminds me of ""Mon Occitania es metissa"" (Don't try and google translate that sentence, it won't work).  
My Occitan is ""mixed, a melting-pot, culturally diverse..."". That sentence shows the spirit in the air around here, the openness of the culture.  
The first three intersting cultural things in Montpellier that come to my mind are:  
1)""Le Jardin des Plantes"" are gardens that date back to 1593!  
2)Musée Fabre have a painting created in 1866 that still manages to create controversy today!  ""l'origine du monde"" by Gustave Courbet.    
3)Every year they host the ""Festival du Cinéma Méditerranéen"" (THE Mediterranean annual film festival)  
Then there are a few points of useless knowledge such as the capital of Vermont in the US have their name that comes from that city, part of Bristol U.K. is named after that city...

With my post, it is obvious that my mind can't be impartial in the choice you have in between two cities.  
One of them already has a piece of my heart.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"OK, [here](http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/FSECON/EC10.htm) you can read for example about the Stability and Growth pact. It said for example that the national debt was supposed to be 60 % of the GDP and the budget deficit was only supposed to be 3 % ([Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_and_Growth_Pact) has table of how the countries have disobeyed). 

It wouldn't say it is neither here nor there now, but perhaps it is a bit useless blaming everybody for not following it, basically no one has. It is however, saddening, frightening, and frankly, very undemocratic of the countries in question.

However, the first Stability and Growth Pact, was formed from careful discussions and rules, done over years. Then people, in the different countries got to vote about joining, *with these rules as a basis*. That is what people voted about, among other things. I remember, I voted (no btw) in Sweden. That was one of the many issues up for discussion, the Stability and Growth pact. Now, it has been re-negotiated twice, but not in the Parlament,by the council. Nor have one then asked the countries who are about to join (Poland for example) if they want *not* to join, the rules have changed, considerably. Had one cared about democracy, the new SGP would have been voted about again, through parlamentary elections or through a common vote. How can one just ignore the rules  for decades, then re-negotiate them twice, because everyone is just ignoring them, and then call it democratic? It is horrible to me. Just this alone makes me pretty sure that I am against the Euro for my country, I have seen the ""fiscal disciplin"" with regards to regulations ( I can understand that it is tough now, but back when everything was going great, it still didn't matter) and the unwillingness to let people have a say when they change the rules. 

Something that is much more scary however, because that will really, really change a (Euro) states finances forever, is the changes that have been made in the ECB laws.

[Here](http://www.ecb.int/mopo/eaec/fiscal/html/index.en.html) for example are some of them. Do you notice that there is a ""no bail out clause""? That is for the Euro as well. 

Have the countries followed that clause? No, of course not (Portugal and Greece). While I can understand the immediate respons, I have tried to follow the crises a bit at least, and it has been going on for years now, how can it be justified to ignore a clause again and again, without re-negotiating. In the end, the bureacrats/politicians said yes to that, the re-negotiation has never been brought in front of the people of the EU. If one can do that with one, such an important issue, what other issues will they do that with. I certainly do not think it strengthens the EU acting like that, I think democracy has been lost here.

Democracy *is* lost, when politicians decide to ignore the rules that the people voted about, don't you think? 

What is the worst though is that the rules of the Euro clearly states that ""each and every country is responsible for their own debt"". ""No country should take on any other countries debt"" 

That is not what has happened. I am sure I do not have to tell you that the tax payers from the northern countries have taken on some of the debt from the south, in direct violation with theses rules? 

Even though I am sure both of us can understand, as I have said before, the reasons for doing it, it clearly points to something happening the voters have not have had chance to vote about and what more, something they, in every Gallup, in every poll voters have said no to shouldering another countries debt!

While this might happen in fifty years, don't you think something as enormous as this is something everyone should be asked about ? Poland might not want to join under those premises, and the Finns, if asked, might decide than rather than to pay for the Portugues, they will leave to (I am not blaming Portugal, they are not having fun, just example). Instead, they are sneaking it in, little by little, among other things through the ECB.

I am sure you can see how enormous the fact is that countries are now taking on each others debt is, but the fact is - people has said no! What gives anyone the right to go against it then, for years and years, which is actually what is happening now. And above all, isn't it horribly un-democratic? What is the next thing they will ignore? 

I think the Euro was wrongly constructed, which has lead to many problems. However, it is *when* the times are tought that our democratic resolve get tested.

This did pass through the required channels. It stems from Articles 121 and 126 TFEU (Which the Member States approved, either by referendum or through their national parliaments), which gives the Council these powers. You might not like that the Parliament wasn't involved (I don't like it either), but the People voted for it to be that way when they passed the Treaties. There *is* democratic legitimation on this point.

&gt;Do you notice that there is a ""no bail out clause""?

You are referring to Article 125 §1 TFEU. But Article 125§2 TFEU contains a saver, which says:

&gt;The Council, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may, as required, specify definitions for the application of the prohibitions referred to in Articles 123 and 124 and in this Article.

So, again, the Council is not stepping outside of the boundaries laid down by the People when they voted for the Treaties. These are the provisions we voted yes to. Whether or not they are good provisions is a separate issue. But they have been followed by the politicians. They *have* acted within their democratic mandate.

At that stage it will be a protest vote and there will be no more getting away from it and pretending the problem doesn't exist.  At that stage the EU will have to admit either a de facto two tier Europe already exists, and to discuss terms, or to accept that the EU isn't going to grow into anything else whilst the UK has a veto and/or without a UK referendum on leaving altogether.

THE KRAUTS the Krauts they think they’re louts  
But I’ve seen nastier Brussels sprouts  
They strut around like football yobs  
But they’re all talk and cheesy knobs  
They live on pickled vegetation  
What a fucking stupid nation  
All their nipples are bright green  
The strangest folk I’ve ever seen 

THE SWEDES the Swedes they’re fucking weeds  
And all their cities look like Leeds  
They walk around with plastic bags  
And noses stuck in porno mags  
They live on fish just like the Danes  
But they’ve got even smaller brains  
Their language sounds like double Dutch  
Their land smells like a llama’s crotch 

THE GREEKS the Greeks we’ll slap their cheeks  
And lock them up in bogs for weeks  
Puke in their restaurants and bars  
And write rude slogans on their cars  
We’ll get a load of herpes scabs  
And stick ‘em all in their kebabs  
and write a note IN PUKE to say  
‘CLUB 18-30 RULE OK!!’ 

THE POLES the Poles eat toilet rolls  
Their underpants are full of holes  
They have to queue over an hour  
To get a mouldy cauliflower  
They whine and whinge and gripe and moan  
And play the hairy pink trombone  
They’re always wanking in the loo  
There’s fuck all else for them to do 

THE YANKS the Yanks
……Duh…..many thanks  
For bringing in your bombs and tanks  
And crossing many a foreign border  
To bolster up the New World Order  
You’re foreigners but you’re alright  
’Cos you speak English and you fight  
Or so it tells me in ‘The Sun’……  
COR! BEING A MORON IS SUCH FUN!!!

* **Sweden**: Prudish, beautiful, demasculinized, boring teetotalers who are trying their best to ignore that their country is turning into the Emirate of Swedistan, while using snus and sporting bad hairstyles. They like to come to Denmark to try all the stuff that they are not allowed to do in Sweden. Somehow we still love them like brothers/sisters. [Lots of stereotypes of Swedes in this Danish video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzv6ljgwgzs) (Video in faux-Swedish).

* **Norway**: Mountain monkeys who stole our oil and now prefer to live isolated because of the vast wealth they acquired from this oil. In dire need of butter and cheap beer and pizzas. [Incapable of being unhappy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UAOCGLfaV4) (Video in Danish/faux-Norwegian). But they have a special place in our hearts.

* **Germany**: The sausage Germans inherited the title of archenemies from the Swedes, they like to invade us - more peacefully nowadays as they flock to our beaches. They have a habit of drowning there. Scat porn, no humour and cheap cars and booze.

* **UK**: Ugly binge drinkers with a vampire's level of resistance to the sun or very sophisticated gentlemen/women. A dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde situation.

* **The Netherlands**: Tall, cheap, fellow bike-lovers, who often succeed in being more liberal and progressive than us.

* **Belgium**: Well, it's not really a country now, is it?

* **France**: Arrogant but knows how to cook up a good meal and serve some good wine. Don't like to wash and enjoy a smoke a bit too often. Should really learn English.

* **Poland**: Car thieves and hookers.

* **Baltics**: Thieves the lot of them, Lithuanians especially. They even steal our beloved bikes.

* **Finland**: Vodka and knives. Very similar welfare state values, but their language might as well be Chinese. The misfit of the Nordics.

* **Italy**: Lazy, corrupt and always riding a scooter. Like to harass our blonde girls and will sleep with any blonde no matter how ugly she is. Make fantastic food.

* **Romania/Bulgaria**: Gypsies and pick-pockets.

* **Greece**: Well, this is actually pretty sad. We pretty much only had positive stereotypes of the Greeks before the crisis, except for hairy men and anal sex - although the latter can be positive depending on the viewpoint. After the crisis I'd say the stereotype is now that they are corrupt, lazy and ungrateful.

It wasn't unusual at all for there to be people with identical political beliefs in entirely different parties. Still true now, to some extent but the end of the solid south made it less pronounced.

The South likes it because for all it's sins Brussels is maybe less bad than Lisbon, Madrid, Rome and Athens.

1) The money being collected is not used in the best way possible. When I take a look at what the BBC does and compare what the German counterpart is doing them I'm just baffled. Their productions are of higher quality and they seem to be going the extra mile while the German TV and radio station supported by this don't seem to be doing that. Yes, they have documentaries that wouldn't have been made otherwise but there's nothing I could point to where I'd say ""Man, I'm so glad this got made"".

2) The second thing is that people with low income shouldn't have to pay for it. I'd gladly pay the 18€ a month if I weren't a student.

I've nothing really against it in principal.

I think it is important that powers in government should lie at as local a level as is feasible. Some things it makes sense to administrate on a town basis, some on a region, some on a country level, some within a small group of counties and some on a EU level.

The trick is finding the balance between centralisation and decentralisation and identifying what powers belong where rather than adhering to one approach other the other. For example, although largly supporting decentralisation, I think it is very sensible that defence is managed at a higher level.  

I also believe that the higher up a layer of government is the more it should be designed to promote more stability and long term planning.

&gt; HALTS MAUL!

Ich habe hier weder rumgeschrien noch bisher irgendwas von Sprache gesagt, weil unser Herr Klitoriskommandant ja offensichtlich ganz gut klar kommt.

Es geht hier nicht um bürgerliche Bildungsideale, sondern um den Erwerb einer Sprache, so dass man sich im Alltag anders ausdrücken kann als mit Fäusten und Tritten. Es ist schnurzegal, ob man ""Ich gehe zu Aldi"" oder ""Isch geh Aldi."" sagt.. Ich hab kein Problem mit dem ""Türkdeutsch"" oder wie man es bezeichnen möchte (einige benutzen hier das [K-wort](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanak_Sprak_%E2%80%93_24_Mi%C3%9Ft%C3%B6ne_vom_Rande_der_Gesellschaft), was ich nicht möchte), das Problem ist die mangelnde Ausdrucksfähigkeit -- und das wie bereits hier erwähnt in beiden Sprachen. Es geht nicht darum [Goethe oder Hegel zu lesen](http://www.welt.de/print/welt_kompakt/print_politik/article110446209/Hegel-Kant-und-Goethe-verstehen.html), sondern eine vernünftige Diskussion führen zu können, eigene Standpunkte vertreten zu können.

Integration heißt für mich auch, dass man den positiven Idealen hier in Deutschland was abgewinnen kann, dass man gerne hier sein möchte und ein Teil der Gesellschaft. Ich weiß gar nicht mehr, wie häufig ich unprovoziert als Deutscher oder Kartoffel beschimpft worden bin. 

Außerdem sollte man fairerweise wohl auch erwähnen, dass z.B. Deutsch-Russen sich wesentlich besser integrieren und in der zweiten Generation kaum von den Einheimischen zu unterscheiden sind in Bezug auf Integration.

What you got to know is that there is two main brands of paper in France, OCB and Rizzla but in the end, they're both own by the same company (Bolloré) so I'm not quite sure they are that different. I use Rizzla ""Micron"" that are supposed to be the thinest ones. You might some other brands such as Yeuf that are good too. In my opinion, don't ever ever buy paper that is white it's awful at burning.

Regarding the tobacco I personnaly go for Fleur du Pays wich is the nicest in my opinion but I like pretty dry tobacco, Golden Virginia is good too but wetter.

And for filters, I'd go for a plastic bag OCB rather than a box pack because those are too small, but again, personal choice.

Your country has more bikes per capita than any other, your cities are rather small, however they occupy half the country and you have (at least when it's not snowing) one the best public transport systems in the world. 

Also most of the streets only have on line so you don't have to move between lines in a traffic jam (which makes things a lot easier).


For comparison: next to my house there's a highway with 20 lines in total that is just crazy. A few Dutch have come and tried to get in there and one hour later they were quite nervous.",0,1357414020,null,0,false,0,c7rl7oj,t3_15ylyg,t1_c7rl7oj,t1_c7rj5or,null,1430865708,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Does anyone know of any solution to debt and deficit that doesn't involve spending cuts and tax hikes? Because that's the only solution I can think of unless we get a massive amount of something new to tax.
