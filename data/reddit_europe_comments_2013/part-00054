It's not a very big place, yet thanks to its international airport and British garrison it has a nice international atmosphere.

Another recommendation is the Zeppelin Museum in Friedrichshafen, about 200km from Munich at the Bodensee, the biggest lake in Europe, if I remember correctly. Giant airships like the infamous Hindenburg were built here. They've actually recreated parts of the interior of this airship for the museum, which is really fascinating.

Yet, we do not find this behaviour to be widespread.

true,vertumne,EURO,Slovenia,"&gt;Not giving them a part of the money you worked for so all can have the same standard of living.

You gave that money to your industry leaders when you didn't demand higher wages for your work, and now you are fighting for them to keep it? Do you think they care about you at all?

&gt;They would not be paid ""less"", they would be paid adequately, they would be paid relative to the amount of goods their society produces.

In a currency they can't control.

&gt;So it is actually in Germany's interest to have strong economies around them that would buy their stuff. The only problem with this concept is that the economies around them only want to be strong, not to do all the work necessary to reach that strength.

First of all, nothing is easier than having a strong economy if you don't pay your workers what they are worth, and they agree with it. Other nations cannot (politically) afford to save on their own people, because that is precisely the opposite of what a nation is supposed to do. Here is your competitive advantage - and I'm sure all of the Germans in this thread are part of the industry and not the working class, so their enthusiasm for internal devaluation is of course completely reasonable.  
 Second of all, nothing is easier than having a strong export economy, if desolated nations of the south are keeping deflationary pressures on your currency. You are booming and yet your currency is not gaining strength. This boom can be directly attributed to the plight of your fellow Europeans. But of course this is all due to the hard-working DeutschVolk, not systemic imbalances that play to your strengths.

And yet you see problems ahead. What if all those nations, with their 25% unemployment, soon won't be able to afford your washing machines? What if the colorful paper they send you for your washing machines starts losing its value? What then? Well, that won't happen until Angela Merkel plays off all your prejudice and lands herself in power for another five years, and then you'll see the rhetoric change. Something must be done about unemployment, Germans must help their fellow Europeans, ECB must step in, etc. and you will get angry for the first time in years.

Per flusso di cassa non si intente solo ""guadagno"", ma proprio qualsiasi eypos che ti entra/esce in saccoccia.

Mettiamo che tu investa 100 euri in un caga-datteri, una tecnologia innovativa che ha la capacità di cagare datteri per un valore di 15 euri all'anno.

Per 10 anni hai un flusso di cassa in saccoccia di 15 euri all'anno. Ora devi considerare che magari tu fra 10 anni ti vendi il caga-datteri.

Il tuo caga datteri è ancora vigoroso e lucente, però la tecnologia vomita-datteri si sta diffondendo e non puoi puoi rivendere il tuo caga-datteri a più di 70 euri. Bhe, fantastico. Al decimo anno hai un flusso di cassa di 15 + 70 euri.

Quel *qualcosa di vecchio di 10 anni* ha ancora un suo valore, e con un tuo disinvestimento sei in grado di generare un ultimo flusso di cassa di 70, oltre al flusso di cassa di 15 euri annui che hai generato per 10 anni.

A questo punto il VAN significa questo: quanto mi dovrei aspettare da un investimento nel settore dei datteri? Per lo meno un ritorno di 8% all'anno. Bene, questo significa che dal punto di vista del 2013 ogni euro che mi arriverà negli anni prossimi li dovrei *scontare* dell'8%; perché 10 euri domani, nel settore dei datteri, valgono 8% in meno di 10 euri oggi.

Quindi per calcolare il VAN del tuo caro investimento in caga-datteri devi attualizzare i flussi di cassa che hai avuto per 10 anni, non dimenticandoti che il decimo anno hai avuto un flusso di cassa extra dovuto al tuo disinvestimento.

---------

Inoltre, nel tuo ragionamento c'è una falla.

&gt; investo 100 eypos in un qualcosa che mi genera un flusso di cassa di 15 eypos

&gt; al decimo anno trovo un 15,83.

Sì, ok, avevi fatto un errore di calcolo, ma rimaniamo con il tuo esempio.

Hai investito 100 euri e un generato un flusso di cassa che se attualizzato è di 15,83 euro.
Proviamo a riformulare in italiano: hai in mano una quantità di euri che oggi vale 100 euri e stai per generare tanti euri che al oggi valgono 15,83 euri. Insomma stai per passare da 100 euri a 15,83 euri. Che a casa mia fanno -84,17 euri.

Così impari a non investire nel settore dei datteri.

The Germans have pumped *trillions* into DDR, and they are still transferring more than *100 billions* each year.

&gt; The Governing Council of the European Central Bank decided to maintain the current level of Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) until Monday, 25 March 2013.

Translation: we're stating the bleeding obvious that the ECB cannot provide unlimited money to any member state, which is something Cyprus knows. Fun fact: last Friday, ECB told Cyprus that the media-adored ""deadline"" was two days ago.

&gt; Thereafter, Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) could only be considered if an EU/IMF programme is in place that would ensure the solvency *of the concerned banks*.

Translation: Laiki and the Bank of Cyprus (note: this one might still be saved) are not solvent *as the situation is now*, which again is something that Cyprus knows.

The announcement **does not threaten to cut Cyprus off**. Cyprus is and will be a member of the Eurosystem and of the European System of Central Banks. It will still use the Euro as its national currency. The announcement just says that they will not give *more* money to insolvent banks, *above* the limit that has been set now. It also says that they *will* give more money, *above* the limit that has been set now, in the case of an EU/IMF programme, even if these banks still have bad balance sheets, because they believe an EU/IMF programme will make them heal.

Exactly, so how many decades of this situation do you think they can take, without transfers? 


&gt;so you'd have to make that a permanent measure.

The transfers? 

&gt;As the banking union is implemented, that will at least take the burden of supporting banks off the books of the governments, giving them more breathing room.

The banking union that less and less countries want to be a part of? Not even all the Euro countries want to be in it. And, Germany is refusing (with good reason I believe) to guarantee the deposits. So, what sort of banking union is it then? Besides, you can, again, not have a banking union without letting  the individual countries vote.  More and more countries will say no, like now, Finland and the Netherlands are out, Sweden, DK and UK are most definately not in - in the end you will end up with fewer and fewer net payer. How do you think that will work out? Are Germany/France, Luxemburg and Austria perhaps OK with guaranteeing the banks for the whole of Eurozone? I would be extremely scared if I were German, with good reasons. 


&gt;Besides that there are structural funds.

No, there are no structural funds. Now you are mixing up the Eurozone, and the EU. The structural funds belongs to the *EU* and are *not* the Eurozones to command with a wink of a hand. And frankly, the countries in the east are still poorer and need the the help to *develop*, which is what the structural fund is supposed to be there for. I most honestly say that I think it is very, very questionable that you think it is OK to take EU funds that are supposed to be used for development to be used to cover *Eurozone problems* that has arisen because of the wrongly constructed Euro, the incompetence of the leaders etc. That however, is not the EU's problem. I pay tax money to the structural funds for it to be used as just that - not to be used, illegaly I might add, as the Eurozones little bank. HOw can you even suggest that? 

&gt;The difference with the DDR is that other countries still have more leeway to adapt their legislation to their lower productivity situation.

And you think that the legislation will make all the difference? So, what you are saying, is that the DDR would have become competitive on their own, if they have had a chance to control their legislation? So, the *trillions* Germany poured over them were not needed? I mean, that must be it, if you do not need transfers which you say the GIIPS countries can do without. 

Honestly, I think that is so wrong. Of course the trillions poured over DDR made all the difference in the world. Even if they had low productivity, they still had a working society, something that is falling apart in southern Europe. 

You are implying, that if they change their legal system, all will be fine. Of course not, what they need is perment transfers. And, I think it is extremely shitty of the Eurozone leaders not to let the people know that, or letting countries vote.

true,carpenter20m,GREE,Greece,"I already addressed the issue when I talked about changing our mentality. There are a lot of things wrong here in Greece, tax evasion being one of them. But if tax evasion is a cultural thing (and it might well be), then it's been happening for decades on end. The government planned the budget with the revenue it expected it would/could get. This didn't change in the euro years.

I don't know the particulars of tax law (they change all the time), so I can't answer these issues (this roof thing sounds a bit ridiculous; there is some truth in it perhaps, but it seems like an urban legend now). And let us say that, yes, we brought this on ourselves. So did the Italians? The Irish? The Spanish? The Portuguese? The Cypriots? The Belgians even (lately I've been reading how Belgium might be next in line. I have no idea if it's true)? When so many people do so many mistakes, the problem seems systemic; or it seems generated by ""the system"" wanting to exploit the politicians' and the people's greed, if you will. The lender is as much to blame for a bad loan as the borrower, wouldn't you agree?

One other issue. Things, up until 2008, were good. And they had been good for close to 30 years (or gradually improving at least). Just like America's biggest problem was Clinton having sex with Monica whatshername or not our biggest problem was something similar; not the sustainability of a booming economy. Or do you think the average voter looks at balance sheets, debt-to-GDP ratios and the increase in CDS rates every morning? We were voting what we thought were capable people (or at least ideologically congruent) to take care of these issues; and some were voting by thinking with their own wallet. I never said that we're not to blame; but we share the same responsibility with an 18 year old couple who never went through sex-ed and now faces the pregnancy or abortion dilemma. How harsh should this couple be punished and how much blame should be put on parents and schools for not looking ahead?

Last thing. Vacation days have been 20 per year as long as I can remember. It doesn't seem that excessive. Retirement age is another issue. Yes, it was possible to retire at 53 with full benefits (earlier if you were a woman and still had young children), but in reality it would be very difficult. In fact, I don't know anyone who did it (I know a guy who retired at 35, but only because his union must have been the most successful union in the history of the world - details will be provided if asked for). To retire at 53 you had to be working non-stop from when you were 18, in the same job, insured by the same (public) organization. Changing jobs, staying unemployed for a while or changing insurance carrier meant that this 53 thing is not happening. My dad, for example has been working non-stop since he was 12, but because he changed a lot of jobs and insurance carriers only now is he qualified to start thinking about pension; and he is 63. Just because the law allows it, it doesn't mean it's easy to do...

Sorry for the long post, but I don't even think I covered all the issues you raised. If you want, we can discuss it further. Besides, don't think that Greeks aren't blaming Greeks first and foremost. But us blaming us isn't as newsworthy as images of Merkel dressed as Hitler...

It happens to emotional people, more often to individuals with prominent intelligence in their society or group. Actors, painters, musicians but also people of science more than ofter commit such suicides. 

Public suicides are misunderstood. People feel like it's an act of violence against them because they are suddenly confronted with somebody's ugly end. People hate that because it reminds them of how awful life could be and that we're all going to die someday and that is the most frightening thought ever. It's like having a great day and somebody ruining it with their misfortune. You kind of get mad at them for sharing. We also like to forget such horrible things and it's just human.

It's awfully unfair, stupid, and straight down cruel to think that public suicide means people are seeking attention or they are following some sort of trend. Attention seekers make sure their method isn't as brutal, painful, and lethal as self-immolation. Self-immolation is idiot free, easy admission, and means certain death, even with the best modern medicine can do. And they are meant to cause massive amounts of pain, which is a way of proving to everyone you really mean it.

Suicides happen all the time but are never news. Sometimes a big social distress is that last drop for people and there's ""a wave"". To just dismiss such suicides as a ""media craze"" or people being attention whores is what's truly ugly and tragic, and is happening right now in Bulgaria. Instead of demanding something be done to help those people contemplating suicide everybody is just mocking them or making it seem like it's about them and their cause.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Exactly, so how many decades of this situation do you think they can take, without transfers?

Create money. The only ""transfer"" that could happen is a potential devaluation of the Euro.

&gt;The banking union that less and less countries want to be a part of? Not even all the Euro countries want to be in it.

What they say they want and ultimately do are two things. It's called negotiating.

&gt;So, what sort of banking union is it then?

One where European banks are guaranteed by the EU as a whole, so single countries aren't forced to swallow the debt of failing banks whole to prevent a financial domino effect.

&gt;Besides, you can, again, not have a banking union without letting the individual countries vote.

That depends on the legislation of the country. It's perfectly possible to delegate that kind of decision power to elected representatives, it's daily practice in all European countries.

&gt;More and more countries will say no, like now, Finland and the Netherlands are out, Sweden, DK and UK are most definately not in - in the end you will end up with fewer and fewer net payer. How do you think that will work out? Are Germany/France, Luxemburg and Austria perhaps OK with guaranteeing the banks for the whole of Eurozone?

The guarantees will be lower, but the advantage of scale will still give a net beneficial effect.

In any case, as I say, if the ECB is willing to run the printing presses to guarantee the Euro - like every other currency - the problems are mostly served without explicit transfers. Germany might not like that, but they don't like cash transfers either. They'll have to give in on either point or leave the Euro.

&gt;No, there are no structural funds. Now you are mixing up the Eurozone, and the EU.

Given that all Eurozone members are also EU members and therefore eligible for structural funds, that's irrelevant. Not that it's that much money, but it's something that helps increasing productivity.

&gt; is very, very questionable that you think it is OK to take EU funds that are supposed to be used for development to be used to cover Eurozone problems that has arisen because of the wrongly constructed Euro, the incompetence of the leaders etc.

First, I didn't say that structural funds had to be used to bail out banks, merely that they were already being applied to help increase productivity.

Second, the Eurozone problems have not arisen *because* of the Eurozone, rather, they have arisen due to excessive private credit creation, a worldwide phenomenon. They last longer because of the obsession with austerity. I agree that there is a lack of emergency backup for the Euro, but a vital part in that would be the ability to create money, like any other currency.

&gt;And you think that the legislation will make all the difference?

No, but they are forced to use the same legislation which is impractical if you want to catch up. Other countries don't have the advantage of internal transfers but have more flexibility in legislation. In any case, increasing productivity takes at least time, whatever you do, so they 
will have a lower standard of living for an indetermined time.

&gt;Even if they had low productivity, they still had a working society, something that is falling apart in southern Europe. 

And the only thing that is keeping them back is the fact that they needed to support banks and the obsession with austerity. The banking union is a good step forward to solve the first, the willingness of the ECB to create money would solve the rest of it ánd the latter.

&gt;And, I think it is extremely shitty of the Eurozone leaders not to let the people know that, or letting countries vote.

Nous sommes convaincu du bien fondé de notre position qui est très rarement remise en cause dans notre pays (Si ce n’est par des groupes marginaux.), et cela demande un vrai effort de comprendre les arguments adverses pour tenter de s’y opposer.

Je me souviens d’un débat sur la peine de mort avec un Chinois. Nous n’avions jamais vraiment réfléchi à des arguments, étant chacun absolument sûr que l’état de droit dans nos pays respectifs allait de soi. Un des débats les plus chiants auquel j’ai pu participer.

Du coup, je me suis dit que j’allais tenter de m’informer sur ce débat, et comme ce fil est à l’origine de ma démarche, je vous livre ici le fruit de mes recherches google.

Tout d’abord reprenons les arguments de la NRA, qui est un des très gros défenseurs de la liberté de posséder une arme et de s’en servir.


**Pro-guns**


Certains de leurs arguments sont propres à la situation aux Etats-Unis:

- Deuxième amendement. Le respect de la Constitution et l’importance historique de ce texte suffisent à défendre ce droit.

- Défense de l’individu contre la violence de l’Etat. C’est l’idée derrière le Deuxième amendement, qui est très liée au passé colonial des Etats Unis. Si l’Etat dérape vers un modèle totalitaire, les individus doivent être en mesure de lever des milices et de défendre leur liberté.

D’autres le sont moins:

- Défense des bons contre les méchants, c’est celui qui est avancé par /u/KenethDeluxe au début de cette conversation.

- Tirer  avec des armes à feu, [c’est cool](http://www.vice.com/fr/read/des-flingues-et-du-soleil-v7n1). Il faut juste le faire en toute sécurité. La NRA publie d’ailleurs énormément de guides pour manier des armes sans risque. Ils sont reconnus pour leur professionnalisme, même en France.

- Le contre-exemple de la Suisse, qui montre qu’une population peut être très armée sans pour autant subir de lourdes pertes dans des tueries. (/u/MauvaisConseil a donné pas mal de statistiques tendant à montrer que le,droit de posséder une arme n’est pas aussi directement lié au nombre de morts par balles, qu’on pourrait le croire...)

- Le droit de posséder une arme n’est pas synonyme de prolifération. En France, la procédure pour acheter une arme de catégorie 1 (A laquelle appartiennent les armes de guerre démilitarisées semi-automatiques, par exemple le [colt M4A1 qui a un look super badass](http://www.tiroccitan.com/product.php?id_product=276) ou le plus connu AK47 dans sa version semi-automatique.) est relativement simple. Licence sportive auprès de la FFTir, pratique régulière du tir dans un club (Apparemment, il existe un carnet de tir, un peu comme les pilotes comptent leurs heures de vol.)  et déclaration à la préfecture. L’ensemble de la procédure prend environ 6 mois. Pour rappel, ces versions semi-automatiques des fusils d’assaut sont les seules autorisées aux US.


**Anti-guns**


Passons de l’autre côté de la barrière et regardons un peu les arguments contre le droit à porter une arme.

D’abord, l’argument purement Américain:

- Le deuxième amendement a été perverti. Il ne faut pas le lire comme un droit de l’individu, mais comme un droit de la population à s’armer en cas de nécessité. C’est technique...

Puis, les arguments plus universels:

- Posséder une arme augmente beaucoup le risque de l’utiliser pour se suicider, par exemple en Suisse [lien](http://www.swissinfo.ch/fre/dossiers/%20la_suisse_des_records/records_d_europe/Suicides_par_balle,_le_record_dont_personne_n_est_fier.html?cid=8476506) ou dans la police Française [lien](http://www.documentissime.fr/actualites-juridiques/enquete-inserm-le-taux-alarmant-des-suicides-dans-la-police-722.html)

- L’argument selon lequel le droit de posséder une arme et de se défendre diminue le nombre de crimes violents n’est pas vérifié par les statistiques. (Merci /u/Lrpt de l'avoir développé, mais malheureusement les stats montre que cet argument est plutôt bidon.) Si l’on compare les différents états américains qui ont des lois plus ou moins libérales sur le droit à porter une arme en public, il est impossible de voir un effet positif ou négatif du port d’armes (Plusieurs sources [dans la deuxième partie de cet article](http://www.ibtimes.com/nra-its-discontents-how-argue-about-guns-your-right-wing-friends-962078)) Apparemment, c’est un argument anti-armes aux Etats-Unis, mais ça a l’air de pouvoir aussi être utilisé en faveur des armes.

- Le droit à porter une arme favorise la peur de l’autre. Posséder une arme pour se défendre n’engendre que de la crainte et nuit à la vie sociale d’une communauté.

- L'exemple de l’Australie montre que passer des lois en faveur d’un meilleur contrôle peut éliminer une grande part des problèmes. [lien](http://abcnews.go.com/International/australia-model-successful-gun-control-laws/story?id=18007055)


**Synthèse**


Un des articles qui m’a le plus apporté sur le sujet est celui-ci: [lien](http://www.technewsworld.com/story/76924.html) qui montre que l’éducation des porteurs d’armes est essentielle, si l’on veut conserver les armes en relative libre utilisation (Israel et la Suisse prennent beaucoup de temps pour former leurs citoyens au maniement des armes.) et que si on n’arrive pas à les former alors il faut limiter l’accès aux armes (Exemple australien...)

I really don't know about this. It all depends on how the European project turns out. I mean, imagine you're an early settler in what is to become the United States of America. They had their share of fumbling, uncertainties and just general incompetence (including a civil war that continues to shape their society until this day). But reality is, nobody thinks about this time as an era of incompetence. Why? Because it worked out in the end, and the US gradually turned into a major political player, and has {culturally, politically, militarily} dominated the last century or so.

My point is this: I think our human brain is inclined to overestimate the importance of our actions. I have no idea if the European project (whatever that means exactly anyway) will succeed or not, in the long run. But if it turns out successful, and the EU will emerge as a political entity of real power, we will think back to the current era as one of ""shrewd tacticians and ill-received, but virtuously orchestrated power games"". If it fails, we'll think of it as shitty politics. But ultimately, it's the result that dictates the interpretation, in my opinion at least.

Di seguito ti posto i miei conti, passo dopo passo, che se vuoi puoi ignorare: non te ne farò una colpa.

**Edit: non farlo, ho capito dove sbagliavo dibbrutto.**

-------------------------------

CASO A

Metto 100 eypos in banca, vincolandoli a 10 anni. Mi danno l' 8% annuo (impossiburu, ma mettiamo sia così).

Alla fine dei 10 anni mi trovo 100*(1.08)^10 = 215.89 eypos *ed è qui che sbagliavo: non toglievo l'investimento iniziale.

E siamo tutti contenti.

-------------------------------

CASO B

Investo 100 eypos nel cagadatteri di cui sopra, ed ipotizzo un flusso di cassa di 15 eypos/anno.

Alla fine dei 10 anni avrò anche un robo che rivendo per, diciamo, sempre 100 (il cagadatteri è un evergreen)

Il bilancio finale sarà: -100 + 15*10 +100 = 150 eypos

Quindi, se paragono i danari nudi e crudi, il caso A è lammerda.

-------------------------------

Ora, uso il VAN. E riporto la [tabella](http://i.imgur.com/voHgCDD.png).

Ho usato un tasso dell' 8% per il suo calcolo, sia nel primo che nel secondo caso.

E vedo che il caso A presenta un VAN inferiore al caso B. Quindi il VAN mi direbbe che è più redditizio il caso B.

Ora mi sento confuso.

As a result of 9/11, something called the Financial Action Task Force was created with the original purpose of tackling the financing of terrorism, however this was broadened into organised crime, corruption and tax evasion.

As the EU is a party to the FATF, it is supposed to take measures to identify the ultimate beneficial owner of a bank account and the origin and purpose of any money transferred. By implication, the banks should build a profile of customers closely monitoring those that are considered to be ""of increased risk"". Transactions going to or from these account holders that do not correspond to the customer profile must be notified to the local authorities.

For example, if a civil servant in Russia earning $1000 a month is suddenly trying to buy a €1000000 property, the bank should ensure that the origin of funds was legitimate, i.e., an inheritance rather than from a bribe or the proceeds of other criminal activities.

We are typically not talking about the evasion of income tax because in Russia, that is at the laudable level of just 13%. However, even tax evasion (i.e., undeclared income) is supposed to be monitored now by EU banks.

So, you mean, absolutely no transfers from north to south? I do not believe you, besides, it is already happening. 


&gt;What they say they want and ultimately do are two things. It's called negotiating.

Yes, and it will take *decades* to get the UK in there, and frankly, the Euro right now have a massive 12 % support in Sweden, and Finland hates it. We are not doing it, no way. Maybe you can convince us, but how on earth are you going to do that, you do not even have any remotely good arguments, apart from that you need our money. You can hardly get the UK to stay in the EU, now you want them to guarantee Spanish banks, showing them shitty bailouts? 

&gt;That depends on the legislation of the country. It's perfectly possible to delegate that kind of decision power to elected representatives, it's daily practice in all European countries.

I mean vote about joining. It would never pass the Swedish parlament. Nor in UK. 

Honestly, if it was so brilliant, why aren't countries lining up to join. If it is a good idea, it will sell. It is not, because all you want is money. No wonder it will not sell. You haven't even been able to convince all the countries *in* the Euro, doesn't that tell you anything? 

&gt;The guarantees will be lower, but the advantage of scale will still give a net beneficial effect.

So, what are the gains for the UK? For Sweden? None, you have no arguments.

Please, read about the Swedish or Finnish bank saves in the 90's, that were good saves. 

&gt;Given that all Eurozone members are also EU members and therefore eligible for structural funds, that's irrelevant. Not that it's that much money, but it's something that helps increasing productivity.

No, it is not. The structural funds are supposed to go to the *poorest* members, which are all Eastern European, and the only one of them in the Euro is Estonia. Btw, Estonia, the poorest member of the Euro is contributing millions to the bailouts. It is not sitting well with them. 


&gt;Second, the Eurozone problems have not arisen because of the Eurozone, rather, they have arisen due to excessive private credit creation, a worldwide phenomenon. They last longer because of the obsession with austerity. I agree that there is a lack of emergency backup for the Euro, but a vital part in that would be the ability to create money, like any other currency.

Yes, the problems have arisen because of the incorrect construction of the Euro, I am sorry, you are wrong there. However, you are right about not *all* of the problem is due to that, but the basic ones . It is Economics 101, that the internal competitiveness in the low cost/low productivity countries  and it is exactly what has happend. It sank between 20-30 % between 1999 and 2008 for the GIIPS countries (you measure it in unit labour costs, it is all in Eurostat). That was when the economy was up etc. It is economic science. It is also economic science that what you need to counteract it is transfers and investments, debt relief/reconstructuring and not bothering about banks.

Why you are mixing the credit crises up with this is not strange, because parallell with the EZ crises, it is, as you correctly point out, a world wide credit crises. We simply have two crises at once. However, the loss in competitiveness started way before that, and that is the root of the problem for *the Eurozone*. And, to counteract that you need massive investments, transfers, working banking system and debt reconstructuring. Nothing of that is happening. You can't just print money (which they are not doing anyway) and think the problem will go away. 

&gt;No, but they are forced to use the same legislation which is impractical if you want to catch up. Other countries don't have the advantage of internal transfers but have more flexibility in legislation. In any case, increasing productivity takes at least time, whatever you do, so they will have a lower standard of living for an indetermined 

So you think southern Europe is OK with austerity for the next 30 years? I do not. 


&gt;Meh, consumer democracy: expecting to serve you easy choices without responsibility. Democracy is hard work, you have all the rights to get involved in the political process, but you can hardly expect that every single citizen is spoon-fed all important information in easy-to-digest soundbites.

Lehman is not the first big financial institution to fail. You may remember the Long-Term Capital Management spectacular failure in 1998, which threatened, but didn't bring down the system. Instead, the other investment banks simply bought LTCM and cleanly unwound the trades.

What makes Lehman different is that it was only a symptom of the bigger underlying problem. Lehman was only one of the players, if arguably the greediest, affected the by the subprime mortgage crisis. When they ran into cash liquidity problems, the other banks were unable to lend them money to recover. Nobody had any liquidity left. In fact the only entity with enough cash to help the banks ride the liquidity squeeze was the government which started the TARP program.

To summarize, Lehman was central to the crisis, but without the systemic sub-prime mortgages issue affecting the whole financial system, Lehman would have been bailed out by the other financial institutions without any government help.

&gt; The Greek government on Monday reported a primary budget surplus of 463 million euros in the January-February period this year, after a surplus of 368 million euros in the corresponding period in 2012 and a budget provision for a deficit of 1.353 billion euros.
 
&gt; The state budget recorded a deficit of 813 million euros in the two-month period, after a shortfall of 495 million euros last year and a budget provision for a deficit of 2.630 billion euros, Finance Alternate Minister Christos Staikouras said on Monday.
 
&gt; Net budget revenues totaled 8.610 billion euros in the January-February period, up 665 million euros from a budget target (7.945 billion), while net regular budget revenues totaled 7.726 billion euros, up 2.8 pct from a budget target.
 
&gt; The minister said that VAT proceeds fell short of budget targets by 8.1 pct, other consumption tax proceeds were 33.2 pct lower than expected, car registration duties fell 57.9 pct and energy tax proceeds fell short by 3.9 pct. On the other hand, income tax proceeds exceeded budget expectations by 18.7 pct and property tax proceeds were 33.1 pct higher than anticipated.
 
&gt; Public Investment Programe’s revenues totaled 884 million euros in the two-month period, up 454 million euros from budget targets helped by increased capital flows from the EU. Budget spending totaled 9.422 billion euros, down from a budget target of 10.575 billion. Regular budget spending were 832 million euros lower from a budget target, or 3.4 pct down from the same period in 2012. Spending on interest rose by 413 million euros in the January-February period.
 
&gt; Commenting on the data, Staikouras said provisional figures showed that Greece continued successfully its necessary fiscal consolidation course, adding that constant attention was needed to evaluating policies and intensifying efforts to achieve all goals.

Regarding VAT, it was expected that everything related to consumption would fall short. Can't pay, no credit, won't buy.

New values for cosmological parameters in [Lambda-CDM model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model) (compared to WMAP's results):

* Age of the Universe 13.82 billion years (WMAP: 13.78 bn)
* Normal matter 4.9% (WMAP: 4.6%)
* Dark matter 26.8% (WMAP: 24.0%)
* Dark energy 68.3% (WMAP: 71.4%)
* Rate of expansion 67.15 km/s/Mpc (WMAP: 69.32)
* Omega-k ??? don't know as haven't read the paper yet

Surprising findings:

* CMB fluctuations not exactly what standard model predicted
* Asymmetry of temperatures in different parts of sky
* Large cold spot 

&gt;  “With the most accurate and detailed maps of the microwave sky ever made, Planck is painting a new picture of the Universe that is pushing us to the limits of understanding current cosmological theories,” says Jan Tauber, ESA’s Planck Project Scientist.  
“We see an almost perfect fit to the standard model of cosmology, but with intriguing features that force us to rethink some of our basic assumptions.  
“This is the beginning of a new journey and we expect that our continued analysis of Planck data will help shed light on this conundrum.”

Well, let's admit that ""Zypriotisch"" is insensitive, but not as bad as GETTING CALLED A FUCKING NAZI EVERY FUCKING DAY.

Ok, so let's read this ""article"" in this ""newspaper"":
He wonders why the cypriot parliament voted against a tax of 9,9% for accounts that hold more than 20.000€. He admits that it was a mistake that  the finance ministers of the EZ decided to tax people with little savings as well, and that it is understandable that people are upset bout it and he calls that a ""stupid mistake"".

Then he goes on: All this does not change that the two biggest banks are almost bankrupt and that Cyprus need fresh money. Then he writes that Cyprus had the choice between three options:

1.) 10% loss for everyone with +200.000€ on the bank

2.) 15% loss for everyone with +100.000€ on the bank

3.) 100% for everyone because the banks go bankrupt

The cypriot parliament voted for #3, the people are dancing in the streets about it, and he doesnt understand it and calls that ""zypr-idiotisch"".

Well, it's a stupid play of words but imo he's basically right.

On a case by case basis, it's also possible to dismiss someone because having them in the company is nuking productivity due to social interaction, and that, yes, might just be the case if such a case ever happened.

So, you can deduct your cost of travel to and from work but you cannot deduct your interest on your holiday home.

If we return to your example it would mean that individuals could set up a company which receives their 'salary', then proceed to deduct from that salary all expenses reasonably related to the performance of their job. If they wanted to spend money on anything else, it would have to be distributed from the company to the individual. At this point it is income and subject to taxation as normal.

I'd imagine there probably will be a generation gap, especially as 16 year olds are going to be allowed to vote in this referendum. 

Looks like the Yes campaign will have some work to do, and it'll probably work it's way on to Reddit too seeing as there's at least one actively campaigning member who posts in /r/uk /r/scotland /r/europe regularly. I'd imagine there will be a lot of focus on a) getting young people voting and b) active campaigns from both sides heavily targeting kids.

Edit: I found [this](http://www.kantar.com/media/140321/tns_bmrb_-_scottish_independence_poll_-_14th_january_2013.pdf) that suggests that the gap isn't as strong as I expected. Not really sure how valid the sample size and other factors are, maybe someone else can contribute more.

Now the useless and corrupt political class who have nothing of substance use these divisive ideas to shore up support. The nature, not content, of these debates shows us how far in the deep end we currently are.

I tell my French inlaws that many of today's issues are not the fault of the French nor the immigrants. Its the fault, as usual, of the leaders during colonial times. and then by successive leaders who did not address the issue of integration of immigrants.

So where are we today. The immigrants are not going anywhere. You can tighten the laws all you want. And you should if you ask me (I am an immigrant myself by the way). Make it very strict and do not allow anyone who cannot contribute to the system (with the exception of marriage/family) and contribution into the system for at least X number of years before being offered citizenship.

But the politicians arent doing that. All they are doing is playing the blame game, pitting one group against the other. I can understand the corrupt and sometimes uneducated leaders in Africa or India(my home country) playing these games. Not here in this nice country. I expected a bit better.

Inadvertently, he ends up, knowingly or not, using half-truths to make his point; not to mention he ends up indirectly supporting an impossible to implement austerity programme that is destroying the country. 

So, what isn't he telling you? Well, Greece did make a primary surplus; that's not debatable. The way it was achieved is a bit onerous though. They made it by withholding payments to people they owe money to. For example, doctors have not been paid overtime for months, suppliers of medical or other stuff suffer haircuts in their payments, pensions take years to start being paid out, VAT refunds are paid with a delay of months and so on. 

In a few words, if you're not a bond holder, some other official creditor or a public servant waiting for your normal wage then if Greece owes you money you won't be seeing it for a while, if at  all.

The problem is when the fear of it happening increases the chance of it happening. That may not be a huge issue with Cyprus, but there are many other situations in financial markets where that actually is something that happens — the most crude example is bank runs.

&gt; It is like saying the fear of being chased by a tiger is the problem. No it isn't. Being chased by a tiger is the problem.

No, this is a big misunderstanding. The tiger doesn't decide whether or not to chase you based on how fearful you are. Financial markets collapse based on whether or not people believe they will.

&gt;From my personal experience and studies (currently writing my thesis in Balkan history), this almost makes it out that those Serbs in Vukovar are totally innocent bystanders in the war and the current issue surrounding Cyrillic script. Eastern Slavonia was peacefully re-integrated into Croatia in 1997, two years after the war officially ended. Whilst in Serb hands, the Latin Script was banned. Non-Serbs were ethnically cleansed and thousands were murdered by Serbs attempting to take Vukovar and surrounding areas. These were not just Yugoslav Army conscripts or Serbs from faraway places. These were mainly local Serbs who committed such crimes. Under international pressure, Croatia was forced to accept terms of amnesty to all Serbs who committed crimes of rape, murder, torture, theft etc in order to have Eastern Slavonia re-integrated. Fast forward to 2013 and those people who committed those crimes walk freely amongst the victims. This is one of the biggest factors stopping the Serbs from integrating fully into society, thus we have a culture of separation (cafes, shops, schools etc). Added to this are serious suspicions that the 2011 census is not accurate in the number of Serbs in the County. For example, at one address it was found that there were around 30 people were registered there. So clearly there are people being registered as living in the area that do not. There are groups that have reported several such instances and others who believe that this is a deliberate attempt to artificially increase the number of Serbs living there for political reasons.",0,1363885453,null,0,false,0,c8zuoz4,t3_1aq1gy,t1_c8zuoz4,t3_1aq1gy,null,1431658512,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

The point I'm making is that looking at it realistically it's not actually a harsh stance. You invested in high risk markets, which brought you extraordinary returns and now that the risk has come back to bite you in the ass you complain that a levy, which simply wipes out the high returns of failed high risk investment, is unfair. Instead you will likely get bailed out, in effect subsidizing the risk you took by putting the money into Cypriot bank accounts with high depositor interest rates.

The central authorities have good reason to ask for both conditions, so it's not implausible that they would do so. After the initial closing of the banks, Cyprus has rejected the levy, and in so doing threatened to default, and/or leave the Euro, within the deadline set by the circumstances. Whether you view this as a bluff, or as the country playing the cards it holds, depends on your judgment of what such a move would do to wider European financial stability. If this deal goes through, the central authorities have folded, by allowing Cyprus to raise its part of the bailout in whatever way it sees fit.

I believe the situation in the Eurozone as a whole will have to stabilize first before this phase can begin in earnest. For a *proper* recovery, Greece will need outside help, in the form of better (read: longer) repayment schedules and possibly forgiveness of some of its debt, ideally along with an EU investment program (read: transfers). But for this to become politically feasible, the risk of potential further bailouts in other countries needs to come down, and the Greek government will have to enact structural reforms on top of the fiscal ones to signal a real change to the underlying conditions.

But when someone posts some numbers, it doesn't mean that (s)he agrees with every aspect of how the numbers came to be. As a matter of fact, OP was critical of the Troika's inability to comprehend that they can't expect increased VAT revenues when nobody has any money left to consume. I also remember OP posting extremely critical articles and comments about the ill-designed Greek program -- fiscal multipliers and IMF's mistake, social aspects, and so on. These came from socialist and conservative publications. Further, I recall past discussions where all Greeks here, no matter their political affiliation, agreed that nobody can throw anyone outside of the Eurozone. The Euro is not owned by a few countries, but is a common currency.

It would be better to focus on more constructive approaches. The mentality ""us"" vs ""the others"", especially if the supposed ""others"" are among your own people is not helpful.

No and I never said so. Investor confidence in Cypriot banks is already destroyed, even without the bank levy. What we're now arguing about is whether the banks should be bailed out with EU money, tax payer money or depositor money. There is no way around giving them EU money because as you said we don't want to be destroying the country and tax payers from Germany &amp; Co. can still afford these expenditures. 

However, between giving them tax payer money, which is what is being proposed now with the various bond issuance scenarios, and depositor money I can clearly say which is preferable and that is depositor money because they are the ones who actually benefited from the risky loans made by the Cypriot banks. Instead what we'll see is that Cyprus is about to privatize public assets and issue bonds, which will be paid back from Cypriot tax money, i.e. people who had nothing whatsoever to do with the risk taking of the banks.

The link goes to the press release by the Bundesbank (in English). They published the results of their survey today. 

The Bundesbank survey is part of a Euro-area wide ""Household Finance and Consumption Survey"" (HFCS), which means the central banks of other countries performed similar surveys. According to an article by German newspaper FAZ (for the link see below), the ECB has delayed release of the general survey, citing they still need to work on the data. FAZ however cites unnamed sources that say it is more likely the ECB doesn't want to release the survey before a deal for Cyprus is found, out of fear of the reaction the survey might cause in Germany.

So far the only articles about this are on the Internet, but I expect this to be big news tomorrow in the (printed) newspapers. I probably don't need to tell you the most likely 'angle' by which most of the papers will present the news -- something along the lines of ""How come they need our money if a typical German household is worth only 1/3 of theirs?"".

Here are two articles published in German, no English articles so far. [This one by Spiegel](http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/vermoegen-deutscher-haushalte-kleiner-als-in-euro-krisenlaendern-a-890247.html) or [this one by FAZ](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/wirtschaftspolitik/armut-und-reichtum/vermoegensverteilung-spanier-ein-drittel-reicher-als-deutsche-12121631.html).

EDIT: As a corollary to the speculation above, about why the ECB didn't release the study yet -- it is probably no coincidence that the Bundesbank on the other hand decided to go ahead and release their part of the results (and compare it to that of other countries). Honi soit qui mal y pense...

***

As  pointed out by /u/MegaBingo in an utterly charming way, the results could be skewed by average household size (from what I understood the study didn't take household size into account, but simply divided total net worth by number of households to get the average, thus a country with more, but smaller households will get a lower average. Similarly median.). So here's my own (imperfect) calculation to correct for that:

Average household size, Eurostat, 2011 data:

Germany: 2

Italy: 2.4

Spain: 2.7

Median household net worth, per person:

Germany: 25700 Euro

Italy: 68291 Euro

There are no countries as I regredfully find out, but interests and money. I work for 14 hours a day and I also cooperate with German and other EU fellows and we have very good relations. Now, if the Eurogroup believes that the problem is solved if they take the money I managed to save by not spending like crazy, then i am afraid it wont work. The root of the problem will still be there, in Cyprus, in Germany, in other countries. We are supposed to be equal EU citizens. At this moment, EU does not protect the people in Cyprus. It protects only the tax-payers in other countries. We also pay taxes in Cyprus. And we spend a lot also in all other staff because of VERY high customs' taxes etc which do not exist in many EU countries. Anyway, I am not the expert in analyzing the situation, but I do know that we are all EU citizens and we should think twice before we believe our or your politicians...I do thank you for spending the time to read my words.

------------------
Dear madams/sirs, Cyprus Parliament Representatives, European Council
Representatives, Eurogroup members,

in view of today's announcement about the decision of Eurogroup to
request for a mandatory contribution of Cyprus banks' depositors in
return to the loan which (for many different reasons) Cyprus seeks to
receive from EU and IMF, please, allocate some of your valuable time
to read and comment on my following message.

Both my parents have been born and lived, until the day of the Turkish
invasion, in the occupied village of Lysi, Ammoxostos. During summer
1974, they lost all their property and they literally started from
zero, in both economic and psychological terms (due to their bad luck,
they had no deposits and they owed nothing).

In the years that followed, they worked with sacrifice (literally, I
emphasise, because words have lost their meaning last), supra many
hours and suffering many deprivations. By the age of 50, they had
hardly ever been in a restaurant, they had not known the meaning of
cafeteria, they had not been in vacations more than 2 days per year in
Pedoulas village in Cyprus, they had never seen any entertainment
places, and many more that if mentioned will not add much to the
meaning. Because of their good education and the opportunity to be
paid well enough, they managed to safe some money that allowed their
two chlildren (my brother and myself) to study with dignity, that
helped us to buy apartments (with loans and guarantees, ""to save some
cash for an hour of need"") and that gave us little cash in a bank
account so that we could have a ""better"" life than their own.

Today, our potential loan-givers, decided to put their hand in our
pocket and steel our money, to make sure that they will get all their
money back, adding also the proper interest. This pocket, belongs to
the people described above. In people who, all these years, have been
paying first all their obligations and so tought their children. For a
second time, they themselves are in dire position of being forced to
pay for the damage, while the actual responsible people (in Cyprus and
abroad) have been making profits in the last many years and have not
shared these profits with anyone.

Dear madams/sirs, it is totally irrational and unfair for someone to
take our money, money that we did not steal and for which we have
already paid all our duties. We will NOT accept to become the victims
in a way that we do not participate in the decisions. If you are not
willing to take the correct and hard decisions to help us fix our
system, we thank you but we do not want the loan any more. We will
fight with our internal problems and find other, possibly even harder,
solutions. We ask to be informed about the whole situation with Cyprus
depts and study all our options. Until we do so, we ask from our
parliament representatives to vote against this horizontal and
irrational cut of private deposits. We are ready to give more for our
country and at the same time fight with any corruption. We are NOT
ready to pay for a no-solution just to save your chance to get your
money back. We are not numbers, we are people, we are individuals. It
is always the easiest decision to apply horizontal measures...but it
is rarely the most fair one.

Thank you in advance for your time and, please, consider the above
message as important.
With respect,

E' vero che G+ si pone al secondo posto per numero di account (è logico l'effetto ""google account"" e lo mettono loro stessi in evidenza, per ben due volte), ma il resto della ricerca è ""viziato"" dal fatto che visite mensili e l'attività sul social non sono separate dalla semplice visita a Google. Che significa? Che hanno contato come visita a Google Plus la semplice apertura di Google.it con l'account loggato (controlla gli asterischi, quel numero abnorme di visite è il risultato delle visite al search engine) e l' ""attività"" su G+ come indifferenziata dall'attività su alcuni servizi ad esso collegati. In poche parole, non è esattamente verissimo che Twitter abbia meno attività di g+, al contrario, confrontando le persone che hanno postato nel mese di riferimento la bilancia pende a favore di Twitter; il rapporto Persone-Postanti-Qualcosa/Visitatori-Totali è circa 1/2, mentre per Google plus siamo molto sotto 1 su 3.

Ok, so austerity needs to go. Excellent.

So our solution is to offer sub-prime mortgages. Had it not been for those then we wouldn't be doing austerity in the first place.

A porportion of English people take it personally. I couldn't say how many; I wouldn't think too many at the moment. The sting of resentment is taken out by the opinon polling, which generally favours the union; and furthermore the sheer ridiculousness of trying to separate English and Scottish people. It's hard to hate the Scottish when your grandad comes from Glasgow.

The Scottish independence movement has a side to it that is aggressively anti-English; partly because the best political campaigns have to have an enemy partly because it is, after all, a nationalist movement; and thus it characterises itself as a romantic celtic-nordic nation constrasting starkly with the evil anglo-saxons. It's not the only side to the independence movement, by any means, but it is a significant factor.

This shouldn't really cause us any surprise. We see it all the time. Look at the break up of Yugoslavia, look at Northern Ireland, look at Catalan vs Spanish etc. etc. etc. All nationalist movements are based upon dividing lines, they all contrast themselves with their neighbours, they all view their neighbours negatively; at least while they are campaigning for separation.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Tax cuts mostly increase the disposable income of people who didn't have a lack of disposable income already, so **they just pile up more money instead of spending it**.

That is so ridiculous, nobody piles up money, nobody hoards it around or takes it to the grave, everybody spends it sooner or later or they die and their heirs or somebody else spends it for them.

Anyway, the second that person spends his own money and either consumes or invests, they stimulate the economy by created the need for employment which then allow everybody, including those who are worse off, to climb the social ladder on their own without any need for government redistribution.

&gt;Don't believe me, just check it out: the countries who made the heaviest cuts were also the countries who experienced the most grave economic shrinkage.

You can't just look at the government spending cuts, if a country cuts spending without cutting taxes then obviously you're going to have a great restriction in the economic activity. On the other hand, sure, you can increase government spending without raising taxes and artificially increase the economic activity.

However, if you consider that government can't spend that which it doesn't have, that all government spending will sooner or later have to come out of the disposable income of the individuals within a society, then it acts as a zero sum game, you either spend a lot but also tax a lot or you spend and also tax very little. So the question isn't about if the government should tax or spend but rather when to spend and when to tax and what's the best way to improve the economy, if with plenty of government intervention in the economy and active redistribution of wealth or if with minimal government intervention and society as a whole through the market being the system that redistributes and creates wealth.",0,1363907199,null,0,false,0,c902sgo,t3_1antsg,t1_c902sgo,t1_c901uyo,null,1431662399,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Mi spiego meglio: smontare computer, programmare e usare Photoshop sono tre materie completamente diverse, scegline una (evita la prima che è inutile) e impara il più che puoi di essa. Resta generico però, non ti fossilizzare su Java o C# o Javascript o che ne so, impara a programmare, non a usare un linguaggio.

Great place to hang out in nice weather and watch Paris.  http://g.co/maps/jeyx4
 
Also check out Sacre Coeur, you will see an amazing view. http://www.sacre-coeur-montmartre.com/ 
 
Also go here for some seriously great ice cream, Berthillon: http://g.co/maps/tmwvb
There are a LOT of places on that street that serve Berthillon ice cream, but that place with the wood panelling is the original (where they make it) as far as I know. 
 
Musée de l'Armée is a museum full of weaponry and armor, from the middle ages all the way up to modern times: http://g.co/maps/hbf9r

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*[Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.
*[Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 
*[Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing
*In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!
*Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

**Bamberg:**
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.
* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)
* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above
* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.bamberg-guide.de/bamberg/bierundbierkultur/kellerbilder/titelfoto-bearbeitet.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.
* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.
*Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recomment ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**
*[Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here
*[Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)
*Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see
*Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live, and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car.
*[Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremburg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle there and live there.
*[Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.
*The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.
*At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.

true,TheMania,null,null,"Let's just be clear, Brazil/Russia only have high bond yields because their respective central banks are targeting high interest rates on the interbank lending markets.

It's true for any currency-issuing government, bond yields are always going to be around expectations of central bank set interest rates over the bond term.

That is, if over the 10yrs of the bond banks are expecting that the central bank will have them lending to one another at 5% interest, they wouldn't let 10yr bonds from the currency-issuer return more than 5% interest, for they'd sooner buy those as investments than lend to one another. The reverse is also true, if the Central Bank of Russia has banks lending to one another at 8% interest, bonds can't return substantially less than that or banks wouldn't buy them, for they'd get higher returns simply lending on the interbank lending markets.

That is, if bonds were issued every single day with 24hr terms they would always go for the interest rate the central bank sets on the interbank lending markets. When they go for longer than that, they go for the expectations over the period.

Bond yields for currency issuing governments are therefore simply a policy decision made by the government sector. They're an instrumental part of monetary policy, and ought not be confused as some kind of evaluation of a government's fiscal stability. Australia doesn't have higher yields than Japan because investors think it's less likely to pay their bonds back, it has higher yields because the RBA chooses to set higher interest rates. Etc.

If Greece were on the drachma, yields could not have shifted unfavourably against them any more than they have against the UK/Canada/USA/Japan/Singapore/etc. There would have been no need for the widespread poverty and suffering currently facing them.",0,1363922369,null,0,1363923147,0,c907r6j,t3_1aq8v1,t1_c907r6j,t1_c8zwarp,null,1431664807,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Given the cold-spell Europe is under at the moment, you might also hop over into the Alps and go skiing if you feel like it as there may be some snow left. It's a bit pricey (because you'd have to rent equipment etc.) but given that you're from Texas, might be worthwile.
I'd highly recommend the Alps/Alpenvorland (the area that isn't quite in the alps yet) anyway, even if you don't plan to go skiing. If you feel like adding another country to your list, Austria is quite close. Also, Neuschwanstein castle is good for a photo-op.

I'd recommend to spend some time in Berlin as well, as it is a nice contrast to Munich and probably the most significant city for Germany's recent history.
On your way there, you might want to spend a few days in Prague (it's basically on the way).

When you make it up to Berlin, Hamburg is only 100 minutes by train away, so you can hop over there for a day or two as well

If you have too much time, you can also see the western Rhine region, with a bunch of nice cities and castles/fortresses everywhere. And hop over to Paris.

The most convenient way to travel Germany and continental europe is most likely the train. There are low-fare airlines available, but high-speed rail connects most major cities (at least in Germany) and the train stations tend to be much more central than the airports. Trains are fast, mostly on time, clean, safe and probably the most German way of long-distance travel. And it feels more hassle-free than in the US.

Being non-German, the German-rail pass (with extension) is probably the best you can get: http://www.bahn.de/i/view/USA/en/prices/germany/germanrailpass.shtml or http://www.bahn.de/i/view/USA/en/prices/germany/german-rail-pass-big-four-promotion.shtml

It's basically a ticket where you buy a number of ""travel days"" within a 4 week period and it includes the ICE high speed trains. You have to buy it outside Germany and there's a promotion running for purchases until the end of march.

For more local needs (e.g. within a city or state) there are usually day tickets for a reasonable price that allow you to ride regional trains as much as you like (e.g. state-wide tickets are about 21 euros). These can be bought locally at any train station.

&gt;But the main purpose is brotherly cooperation between the 4 countries

   No, funny, but no. There is south-east England, and then there is everyone else.
 

   The origin of the UK lies in a century long political battle between Scotland and England(with Wales, having been eaten already) after a Scottish King took both thrones and then proceeded to move to London. This culminated in a series of acts and counter-acts and this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Act_1705, an attempt by England to choke Scotland. Scottish lords and creditors then proceeded to run the Darien Scheme, as an all or nothing attempt to break the choke hold, and they got nothing. 

Now heavily indebted the lords and creditors influenced the Scottish goverment in accepting the English deal, an Act of Union in exchange for money. And so the United Kingdom was born, with the dissolution of the Scottish parliament. These lords and their offspring would later turn against Scots and enact the Highland clearances. Thus followed 300 years of ""This Act shall apply to Scotland only"" from London, which was only alleviated in 1999 when the now existant Scottish parliament was created, 30 years after another referendum which failed, and this will sound familiar, because of a clause requiring 40% of participation, although would have won by a rather narrow margin. 

The only right choices now, in my opinion, is either the UK adopts a federal system granting rights to North England as well, and hopefully giving London a separate division, or Scotland does what it needs and separates. There is a lot of unfairness and obfuscation in the UK system which is just not being dealt with otherwise. The only way the referendum can backfire is if they vote no and the government proceeds to take it as ""we consent to everything""

No. The loans issued by Greece Loan Facility and EFSF have very low interests. In fact they are below market funding costs of some Euro countries, meaning those countries are effectively making fiscal transfers to Greece.

Please see the latest IMF report on Greece, it's very informative even when skimmed: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr1320.pdf

*The margin over 3-month Euribor on the €53 billion in debt to the Greece Loan Facility (GLF) was reduced from 150bps to 50ps, and the 10bps operating fee on EFSF lending was eliminated. The GLF reduction brings it below the market funding cost of some euro area member states, implying an effective fiscal transfer from countries facing larger effective sovereign borrowing spreads.

I got free drinks there all night one day without it being my birthday!

And people keep raving on about [Le Comptoir Général](http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-comptoir-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral-paris-2). Have not been, but my American friend loves it.


Alternatively, check out any of the restaurants and bars at [Rue Mouffetard](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=rue+mouffetard&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl), there's an awful lot of places where you can have Raclette and other very French dishes (beware, they often include weird animal parts).


Then I can recommend a number of vegan/vegetarian places, but I don't know if you're interested in that.


I do advise you to stay away from the Champs Elysées, because it is overpriced and full of snobby rich people (IMO). I always feel completely out of place there. Also the touristy areas around Saint Michel (Notre Dame) and the Louvre tend to be pricey but not necessarily very good. The area around the Moulin Rouge and Sacre Coeur (Métro Blanche/Pigalle/Barbès Rochechouart) is just plain creepy after dark, though there are some cool bars scattered around. Might be a bit too much for a birthday though.


You should be aware, that almost all bars close at 2, though, so if you want to go out for longer, you should go to a club or pub. People have told me that [Truskel](http://www.truskel.com/) is better than it looks on the homepage and stays open for long, I have not been myself, though. I hope you have fun in Paris! :)

there are a lot of people who live breaking the rules but also as well a lot of people following them,even if they must suffer bigger difficulties due to the other asshole group.
