Not really, no. After living on my own for a year (any time I could afford it, really), I came back home for my master's and another year after that (I was ""paid"" 300€ a month as an intern, in a city where a studio apartment costs 450€ a month and requires you to show a full time permanent work contract). At that point, my relationship with my mother within the home was really closer to one between adult flatmates - which is basically what it was: I lived at home because I couldn't afford to do otherwise, and while my mother didn't *ask* for participation to the rent or living costs (I volunteered it), she couldn't comfortably afford the place by herself anymore. I did the same chores, groceries and cooking than I would have done if I lived alone, with the added benefit of having access to a dishwasher and washing machine. Sure, my mother did treat me to a meal out or a movie on occasions, but so did I any time I got a bit of extra cash.

You say you moved out by getting a job at 16. Well, good for you, and many Europeans sure wish they could do the same. But in the current economy and housing market it is simply not an option. The entry level job market (paper routes, waitressing, baby sitting, cashiers etc) is completely saturated with university graduates who do it full time because there is nothing else, and many more are unemployed. Same goes for getting a driver's license and a car: when the license itself costs upwards of 2,000€, either your parents are well-off enough to afford to buy you lessons as a present when you turn 18, or you wait until you have a career to learn.",0,1358323387,null,0,1358341393,0,c7xtc0y,t3_16n6y6,t1_c7xtc0y,t1_c7xqhvj,null,1430978891,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

God, you must really hate your parents, or they must really hate you.

I sincerely do not understand why you are so puzzled. But then again, I cannot even begin to grasp what it means for americans when they say their family disowns them. It seems to happen a lot, be it because you turn out gay or atheist in the Bible Belt, or because you're a junkie, or a lazy neckbeard, or whatever. As a portuguese man, to have my family tell me they no longer want anything to do with me would be completely overwhelming. It would have to be a really, really serious reason.

So you see, there are great cultural differences between us. In Europe, we love our parents, we respect all the work they ever put into raising us, and we will forever be in their debt. True enough, it is not perfect and sometimes we have arguments, but that's a perfectly natural human relationship. For as long as we follow a bunch of small rules and help out with whatever we can, be it money or cleaning up stuff, we all get along.

To clarify what I think Migun tried to say: if you have no need for it, be it because you work far away or because you found a significant other you wish to live with, why would you choose to live alone? Having a house of your own is great but to live alone just sounds so sad.

Irrational? As in ""cognition, thinking, talking or acting without inclusion of rationality""? I have absolutely no idea what you mean by that.

I am saying that Sweden have higher taxes and we are better at paying them. How is that ""acting without rationality""? To me is very rational to pay taxes, if you want the state to function and to serve you. I think it is much more irrational by Greeks *not* to pay taxes, and then expect services.

You seem to want me to feel sorry for you taxwise, that the taxes are draining the poor Greeks.

Tu as très bien compris. Je ne tombe pas dans ce piège car c'est un faux débat pour éviter de parler sérieusement. La loi ne doit pas parler de préférences sexuelles. Sinon ce serait inégalitaire. Pour rappel, le conseil constitutionnel a statué là-dessus et la loi actuelle respecte l'égalité. Si tu veux on peut parler d'adoption, dans ce cas on fait une loi sur l'adoption. On peut parler des conjoints des parents. Dans ce cas on fait une loi sur les beaux-parents.

Je ne suis pas contre le mariage des homos, je suis contre le mariage tout court, je ne vois pas les raisons pour lesquelles des couples mariés **ou pacsés** auraient plus de droits que des couples non mariés ou que les célibataires. Pour moi c'est une rupture d'égalité entre individus mariés et individus non mariés, mais l'État est d'un avis différent.

Aussi, si on veut changer la loi pour accorder ces droits à plus de gens, j'aimerais bien qu'on m'explique en quoi c'est nécessaire. Jusqu'ici, je n'ai eu aucun argument valable. Comme précédemment expliqué par le conseil constitutionnel, l'égalité est actuellement respectée. L'argument de l'égalité n'est donc pas valable.

Je vais donc répéter mon point de vue :

- Pourquoi accorde-t-on des privilèges aux couples de sexe différents non parents et majeurs ?

No, the SNP have made it fairly clear they want absolutely nothing to do with Trident, presumably that would mean they take control of Faslane, along with all the other Scottish military bases. As to what'll be done with the nukes, that remains to be seen. The rUK don't have anywhere they can safely store them, and it's estimated it would take ~10 years to build another place to store them, so; it suggests that the Scottish Government might be able to use them as a bargaining chip in negotiations, saying we'll keep them until you get another base build, but it return for some concessions. 

I certainly can't see the nukes remaining in Faslane indefinitely.

true,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt;basées sur une orientation sexuelle

C'est faux. L'orientation sexuelle n’apparaît nulle part dans la loi.

Je te répète ce que j'ai mis juste au-dessus :
&gt;La loi ne doit pas parler de préférences sexuelles. Sinon ce serait inégalitaire. Pour rappel, le conseil constitutionnel a statué là-dessus et la loi actuelle respecte l'égalité.

Elle respecte l'égalité car elle ne parle pas d'orientation sexuelle. J'ai une personne dans ma famille qui est mariée et a deux enfants ET est homosexuelle. Elle est mariée à une personne de sexe différent !

Tous les homosexuels peuvent se marier, donc la loi est égalitaire. C'est du droit, c'est validé par le conseil constitutionnel et je n'y peux rien.

Je t'explique la logique en droit : on accorde beaucoup de droits et quelques devoirs via un contrat qui s'appelle mariage. Il y a surement des raisons, donc avant de donner ces droits à d'autres personnes il convient de s'interroger sur les raisons qui poussent à donner ces droits.   

1. S'il n'y a pas de raisons ou que ces raisons ne sont plus d'actualité, il faut supprimer le mariage (mon point de vue). 

2. S'il y a des raisons valables, il faut voir à qui elles s'appliquent et éventuellement corriger les personnes qui ont le droit de contracter un mariage : personnes de même sexe, polygamie, personnes de même famille ...

Les lois faites sous la pression populaire et à la va vite sont de mauvaises lois. On a l'exemple des 75% qui est tellement mauvaise qu'elle a été invalidée. On est en train de faire la même chose avec cette loi sur le mariage.

La bonne direction, à mon humble avis, ce n'est pas d'accorder des privilèges à plus de monde, c'est d'abolir les privilèges.

Qu'on supprime les avantages fiscaux liés au pacs ou au mariage, qu'on supprime les abattements sur les successions, qu'on supprime le quotient familial en individualisant l'impôt, qu'on donne de vrais droits aux beaux-parents, qu'on réforme vraiment l'adoption pour donner des parents à ceux qui en manquent et autoriser de nouveaux types de familles.

If yes, why move out at 25 and then move together again in one house or the other at 35, it is a waste of effort for 10 years?

The situation can simply grow from parents taking care of you, then you are equals, then you take care of them, as they get older and you get more mature. 

Not necessarily it is always parents taking care of children, quite often the other way around, when they are older.

The important part is to forget the difference between ""you live in parents house"" vs. ""mom lives with your and your spouse in your house"".  There is no theirs house or your house. Only the family's house. The basic unit must be the family, the kin, not the individual. Whoever uses the house is beside the point. 

The point is, the ""boss"" is always those who are closer to the ideal 35-55 years old. Much younger, and parents boss them, because they have not enough life experience. Parents much older means their children boss them, because they are becoming feeble-minded.  So it is always someone around 45, experienced but still fresh in mind in charge, first parents, then children :-)

I can tell you my 82 years old grandma does not boss anyone, does not take care of anyone - she can hardly remember her sisters names. But she needs plenty of taking care of.

Actually when family members stick close together, they need less taking care by government.

I've just read up on the belgian law and the rules are very strict: the patient has to have serious psychological or physical issues (the quality of life isn't enough for them to feel human), the request for euthanasia should've been repetitive (including two recent requests), two or three physicians have to be consulted and agree on the request and last but not least the patient (and *only* the patient) has to be conscious and capable of requesting it after being informed or informing themselves on the whole process. *It should be an informed, non-dubious and voluntary request by the patient him/herself.*


That *other* people have objections to it shouldn't be a concern. No one else is harmed by this.

Edit: The article I read on the process didn't mention it, but it's a bureaucratic process as well, since it has to be proven that the patient really, really wants this. If you make one mistake involving the prescribed guidelines as a physician, you could face a trial.

Edit 2: Wow, the Belgians sure want things covered. The request has to be submitted with the civil services of where the patient lives. The medical ""commission"" who judges the request are the personal physician, a specialist in the disease which led to the request and a third physician to review that the process is done within the rules.

Edit 3: According to their physician: One of them suffered from respiratory problems and could only sleep while sitting on a chair. The other brother underwent a neck surgery which damaged his spinal cord. He could barely walk. They couldn't take medicines because doctors feared it would cause their eyes to deteriorate even further.

But if you don't have an open-ended work contract or are a student, you get council or student housing. The former is about 700 euros for a 50 m^2 flat (there are smaller and there are bigger, and the price depends where you live -- this is in Helsinki, the most expensive place in Finland), the student housing about 250 euros for a 20 m^2 room and a common kitchen and bathroom with one or two other people.

I know that in the provincial ""capitals"", you can get from council housing 70 m^2 flats for 400 euros per months, but I don't have much familiarity with those. 

If you're unemployed without earlier work history, unemployed/low income person without live-in girlfriend or children can probably expect about 500-1000 euros per month after taxes (this is a bit complicated and somebody will probably have better numbers - but it consists of several sources that vary in size depending on the other sources - but always enough for rent and food). A student would be given 250 euros for food and another 300 euros for rent (you can also get about 500 euros per month in student loans, if you want to live large). Students can also work on the side without it affecting their allowance.

The numbers are really tight in Helsinki, but in the provinces a student might well live rather comfortably with just the allowance. *Even if you could get a mortage, it would not be a very good idea because you wouldn't get that rent allowance as a student for owned housing, and as an unemployed person the ""owned apartment"" might also cut your benefits.* 

So people rent, and when they get feet under them, they mortage. The end result would be the same as if they lived with their parents till they bought a house.

Disclaimer; it's been a few years since I've been a student and I have enough work history that my unemployed benefits would be based on my earlier salary - I think the number is about 65%.

&gt; The omission from section 30(1) of the Marriage Act 25 of 1961 after the words “or husband” of
the words “or spouse” is declared to be inconsistent with the Constitution, and the Marriage Act is
declared to be invalid to the extent of this inconsistency.

Pour revenir au cas français, la décision du CC repose sur deux arguments principaux :

- le droit de mener une vie familiale normale n'implique pas le droit de se marier
- la différence de situation entre les couples de même sexe et les couples composés d'un homme et d'une femme peut justifier une différence de traitement quant aux règles du droit de la famille

Le CC renvoie donc à la notion de famille.

C'est quoi une famille ?

&gt;The silent obliteration of same-sex couples from the reach of the law, together with the utilisation of gender-specific language in the marriage vow, presupposes that only heterosexual couples were contemplated. The common law and section 30(1) of the Marriage Act are accordingly inconsistent with sections 9(1) and 9(3) [equality] and 10 [dignity] of the Constitution to the extent that they make no provision for same-sex couples to enjoy the status, entitlements and responsibilities they accord to heterosexual couples.

I think it is a fairly convincing argument, however it does still leave the argument of what happens with Schengen and joining the Euro open.

Pour la bonne et simple raison, que tu n'as pas la possibilité de faire autre chose.

En général, elles ne t'écriront pas de mail, même si tu les flashes et que tu leur plais, et tu devras malgré tout écrire ce premier mail personnalisé, lorsqu'elles t'autoriseront à les contacter. Mais, tu n'écriras qu'à celles qui ont déjà montré un semblant d'intérêt pour ta tronche.

true,gefleman,CATA,Catalonia,"&gt;Strasbourg, France (dpa) - The European Parliament will revert back to its habit of relocating to the French city of Strasbourg 12 times a year, it agreed Wednesday, applying a ruling by the European Union‘s top court even though critics view the practice as wasteful.

&gt;The parliament, whose working base is in Brussels, had to vote on the issue after attempts to reduce the number of annual sessions in Strasbourg to 11 ran into legal obstacles.

&gt;In December, the European Court of Justice overruled the move, arguing that the parliament‘s rotation was enshrined in the EU‘s founding treaties.

&gt;Cutting just one of the monthly 500-kilometre treks by hundreds of EU parliamentarians and translators from Brussels to Strasbourg would save more than 2.5 million euros (3.3 million dollars), according to the parliament‘s own calculations.

&gt;Strasbourg was chosen as the seat of the parliament because of its symbolic location, on the border between France and Germany. The monthly influx of parliamentarians is crucial to the city‘s economy.

So the role of the FDP of course was crucial to the political landscape in post war Germany but it's heyday was during the social/liberal coalition from 1969 to 1974.

Today many young Germans, me included, feel that the FDP has either lost touch with it's original message or the common citizen.

Si ça peut te rassurer OkCupid n'est pas à l'abri des profils vides ou incomplets non plus, surtout en cette période de bonnes résolutions. 

(2012, l'année de la loose, 2013, l'année de la baise.) 

Mais, je considère que se planter sur ce genre de profil, c'est la règle du jeu. Faire tous les efforts pour engager la conversation, la faire vivre, galérer à obtenir le premier RDV, risquer le lapin, c'est tout sauf bandant.

Je ne sais pas dans quelle ville tu habites (Certainement près du Channel, j'imagine...) mais je connais des gens qui utilisent OkCupid sur Bordeaux et qui en sont assez contents. Il y a une bonne population d'étudiants anglophones dans cette ville, mais je pense que ce site va rapidement gagner en célébrité. Retourne le checker dans 6 mois / 1 an, ça peut valoir le coup.

Je suis un peu jaloux de ton compte gratuit sur AUM. Sur Paris, c'est pour moi l'un des meilleurs rapports temps/taux de réponse, avec des profils qui correspondent souvent à un sorte d'archétype de ce que je recherche. Un peu bobo, un peu wannabe branchouille, un peu insupportable. J'ai bien aimé ma période sur ce site... Même si, soyons crus, ce n'est pas du tout sur celui-ci que j'ai remporté le plus de succès.

En revanche, pour finir avec une note négative sur AUM, je rejoins complètement /u/tarsac sur son analyse. Les rôles historiques des genres ne sont pas du tout inversés sur AUM. Le côté Rose Bonbon de l'interface fait complètement faux, et beaucoup d'éléments de leur com' m'insupportaient au plus au point.

Je trouve OkCupid beaucoup plus au goût du jour, avec une vision plus libertaire de la relation virtuelle. 

J'aime l'idée qu'ils proposent de se choisir une orientation sexuelle, qui sorte un peu de l'hétéro-normalité, j'aime l'idée que l'on puisse contacter   n'importe qui, et j'aime beaucoup l'idée de faire des stats sur ce domaine de nos vies, qui nous occupe en permanence.

Being a ""functioning democracy"" does not release you of the duty to respect and enforce human rights. And Israel is internationally proscribed (by UNO plenary meeting) for their settlement building and every state except for Israel itself says that the settlement buildings are against the fourth Geneva protocol. 
Israel will also never have a military problem with their neighbors since their military power is superior to all states surrounding them (as proved in several wars) and they produce most of their stuff. They aren't depending of european weapons at all.

Instead of just saying ""they are surrounded by mortal enemies"" you should try to ask ""why are they surrounded by enemies?!"". I don't think the israelis or palestinians are at fault alone for the situation but the israelis are - without a question - having the upper hand and the power over this conflict.


As I said before, Turkey, Israel and Saudi-Arabia are more or less openly violating human rights and are not enforcing human and civil rights for certain groups inside and outside their border. Just because something is called ""democracy"" doesn't make it a democracy.

Liberalism is about respecting the citizen and giving him the ability to control his own life and not have it controlled by the state. It's about privacy and it's about freedom. 

And as long as the Pirates don't get their head out of their own ass and the Green Party drifts toward some sort of ecological dictatorship, the FDP is the only party that can keep liberalism alive between socialist Linke, ""We will do everything to please the little guy"" SPD and ""Man, that shit seems modern, let's ban it"" CDU/CSU.

Again, only discussions and no real proof, but if true it's still a bit inappropriate (but not to most Spaniards). 

Then there's collusion among the players to throw a game when they're playing a team that is about to relegate. This happens without any doubt, is televised and shown, and is wildly inappropriate.

However, with smart phones these days, everyone knows what's going on even on the field. Last season players on the bench would signal to the players on the field if they were safely out of the relegation zone so they could let the other team score. Then there's not unethical/just pathetic when a player from a team that's about to relegate begs the other players to let them score so they won't relegate.

Last season, Zaragoza's miraculous salvation was awesome. I traveled to Getafe to watch, but there were a lot of murmurs and rumors about their amazing winning streak. If anyone is scum enough to fix a match, it was Zaragoza's president at the time. His reputation is the only proof some people needed.

There were a lot of really odd exchanges among players and management in the tunnels after matches last season too. Some of the comments seemed odd… 

Add to all this that Spanish refs SUCK BALLS so when they make their requisite 2 dozen mistakes during a game, fans on the losing end of bad calls have easy fodder.

None of this is direct proof, but having been up close and personal with La Liga for the last two years, I would not be surprised….

Of course, but the reality is that the conflict in Mali isn't as black and white as evil islamists vs secular democratic government. The conflict in Mali actually began with the secular tuareg MNLA group seeking an independent country in the northern part of the country because they have suffered discrimination and violence at the hands of the Malian state which really aren't that good of a bunch of people.

&gt;And regardless, these Islamists controlling northern Mali are the definition of bad guys.

I couldn't agree more, but if you actually look at the ideologies of islamic groups like Al-queda and Ansar Dine their long term strategy is too expel western forces from the islamic world by drawing the west into long and protracted wars in the middle east, more [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda#Strategy). 

Ultimately the war in Mali is based on pre-existing ethnic tensions, and European powers getting involved in ethnic divisions has historically been a massive failure.

---OPINIONE PERSONALE

Grillo *trascina* la gente perchè, tra quelli che stanno in lizza quest'anno, è l'unico che s'avvicina di più a noi poveracci. Credo sia lampante che ogni singolo politico italiano non ha la benchè minima idea di come se la passa la gente comune, tantomeno si sforzerà mai di farlo. 

Giusto l'altro giorno stavo vedendo un pezzo di un comico americano (che non ricordo, forse luis CK?) e una parte m'ha colpito (non chè l'abbia inventata lui è): s'è soffermato sul come i ricchi non si mettono a fantasticare sull'essere poveri, mentre i poveri hanno ben impresso in testa tutto quello che farebbero se avessero un fottio di soldi. Stesso discorso qui da noi: credete davvero che bersani, berlusconi, fini, vendola, casini, o chi per loro, si coricano la sera pensando a come migliorare la vita dell'operaio che busca 1000 euro al mese, della pensionata che non riesce manco a fare la spesa, o dello studente che si siede in classe col registro digitale (ipad) e col soffitto che perde acqua?

L'unica speranza, a mio modo di vedere, è scegliere rappresentati del popolo che **vengono** dal popolo, dalla società che **ora** sta soffrendo; INCENSURATI.

Ora, il caso vuole che nel nostro paese è il movimento di grillo che sta portando la gente comune ad avere una possibilità di andare a poggiare il culo nel parlamento\sedi amministrative varie; io onestamente preferisco **loro** alla schiera di succhia cazzi che comanda il paese oggi.


Regà, ve sta sui coglioni grillo? come **personaggio** sta sui coglioni pure a me, sempre stato, però cercate\cerchiamo di guardare oltre.

Grillo vedetelo come il medium, il liquido seminale che deve portare la gente di cui parlavo prima (o spermatozoi nella metafora) a fecondare quei due palazzacci merdosi.

Even if we're trying to combat radical islamism perhaps its time that we look at western policies in the middle east and how they have fueled terrorism before we get engaged in yet ANOTHER war.

Regardless of any other ideological affiliations they may have, radicals are not rational actors. You cannot successfully negotiate with radical individuals and groups. Extreme Islamists are among them. They are dangerous and large in number. Their influence is far too widespread and not on the fringes of society in the Middle East and North Africa. I'm no hawk, but the Middle East and North Africa have been problematic areas for hundreds of years prior to European imperialism. That's not to say that European powers didn't exacerbate some of the divisions among different ethnic and religious groups, but it gets a disproportionate part of the blame.

I was an avid pirate a few years ago (nowadays I just get TV shows and books for academic purposes only, I'm not that keen on reading) and if it hadn't been for CD Projekt and The Witcher 2, I would've stayed that way. I was impressed with their decision to release a AAA game without DRM, so impressed that I bought it for full price and now I'd rather get a game from either them or Steam if the price is right (here's a wisdom my friend said, ""the price is always right, you just don't have enough money"") because it's more convenient then to pirate (with all the hassle downloading, rars, image mounting, installation, cracking and long uninstall times)

Europeans, myself among them, are quick to admonish the US for misguided foreign interventions and their surprise that they're not well loved in the world for it. 

So why is this article opining that we have to step right into those footsteps? Mali is a colonial creation and the idea that it is endowed with eternal life is naive and misguided. Throwing the boogeyman of Islamic extremism doesn't make it a more prudent idea because last time I checked, Islamic extremism gets traction in these places because of the US has taken the mantle from Europe in supporting unsavory dictators. Let Africa be Africa's problem and maybe we can move beyond a relationship based on intervention and serving our interests to a relationship based on mutual respect and non intervention. 

I know I would not take kindly to the idea of Mali invading the Netherlands because Geert Wilders is a thing, irrespective of how much distaste I have for the man.

They didn't even have a choice. In Mali, a lot of the rebels are conscripted or were indoctrinated, and although I completely disagree with their mores, based on the Sharia law, I still don't find that a reason that they deserve to die. Besides, they're all people with hopes and dreams, not demon spawn without souls. If you shoot a rebel, he'll feel pain just as much you'd do. The rebel has hopes and dreams, for a better future, and genuinely believes he's helping to make that future.

Murder is (rightfully) considered the most gruesome crime a person can commit, and it just baffles my mind that soldiers are not only allowed to kill people who've done essentially nothing wrong, but they're hailed as heroes when they come back. It's just so incredibly sad that innocent people have to kill each other and that everyone considers this normal.

Even a defensive war is hard to justify sometimes. The invading party rarely wants to kill anyone at all, they just want power/territory/resources. Is an attack on this (again, contrived by bad people (Hitler, Stalin, Bin Laden) but performed by innocent people) enough to justify killing? I don't know.

To further add to the moral ambiguity, why is it always men that have to die? Women and children might believe exactly the same thing and actively support the troops, but they're always counted as civilians.

While my intellect might know that pacifism just isn't feasible, my gut tells me killing innocent people is wrong. I've tried, and tried and I just can't convince myself.

On another note, what always surprises me is the extremely rabid opposition to pacifism. I dare say that on Reddit, pacifists are hated more than vegetarians or pedophiles. Your comment is already pretty passive-aggressive but I've had some terrible things said about me.

That's not the point, the point is that both would be unwanted situations. 




&gt;They're not preaching to you, they're preaching against you, that's what makes it so much worse. Islam is inherently hostile to the Western civilization and one has to be deluded not to see it.




So the West is the victim here? All we have ever wanted is just be friends, right? Furthermore, do you genuinely believe that the people coming to Europe, hoping to build a new life here, are *hostile to the Western civilization*? If they were, they wouldn't have come in the first place. 




&gt;I'll say this again: we're going to see some real shit in Europe once Islamist political parties start gaining siginficant power, which is inevitable at this pace, and you won't even hear me saying ""I told you so"".




Meh, I don't see that happening anytime soon. Do you have Islamist parties? We don't. We do have a teeny tiny orthodox Christian party, the SGP. No one takes them seriously.

true,demostravius,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I don't think people are cheering people dying, rather cheering that those trying to help are winning. I think the stigma attatched to pacifism is it makes it sound like if someone where being assaulted the pacifist would stand by and let it happen, which is as good as being the assaulter (not saying they do). It's also biologically programmed into us to work as a society and pacifism can be seen as not helping which is breaching 'protocol'.

I don't understand how a defensive war can be hard to justify. It would be putting the lives of the aggressors above the lives of the defenders. Sure you could just give up x amount of land/resource, but people don't work like that. The attackers would simply do it again until there is nothing left of said pacifist society.
To me pacificm is too idealistic. I really do wish we could live in a world with no aggression, but we have no control over others and people will suffer if you let people do whatever they feel like.


'Collateral' is without doubt the worst part of war, innocents being killed. Another major problem would be brainwashing, take child soldiers they are not evil they don't deserve to die, but neither do the people they are shooting. So how do you choose? You cannot take a pacifist stance here because someone dies no matter what. Do you assist those being attacked and kill the children who have bene brainwashed, or do you standback and do nothing, allowing innocent people to be killed. The question is a bit loaded but it's also a real situation. Ideally capture and phsycologial help would fix the issue but we both know it's not possible on large scales or even for single people at times.

*[Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city.

There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.
*[Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 
*[Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing
*In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!
*Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

There are a few interesting small cities around Nuremburg you might be interested in:

**Bamberg:**
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.
* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)
* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above
* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;hl=de&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=18)  as you'll have a superb view over Bamberg and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;) **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food. 
* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;num=30&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;t=h&amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;radius=15000&amp;t=h&amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.
*Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recomment ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**
*[Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here
*[Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)
*Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

**Regensburg:**
*[View of the City](http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Regensburg_Uferpanorama_2_06_2006.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20060619230718)*

*[The Stone Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Bridge_%28Regensburg%29):* Over 800 years old, served as model for other famous old bridges in Dresden, London&amp; Prague, nothing more to say.
The old town centre with the cathedral is very nice, some nice clubs, good for going out. Also Regensburg is the hme of the [House of Thurn und Taxis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurn_und_Taxis), which is one of the richest houses of Europe and inventors of the modern post system in 16th century.

**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see
*Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live, and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car.
*[Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremburg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle there and live there.",0,1358410090,null,0,1358411831,0,c7ygq75,t3_16pm2p,t1_c7ygq75,t3_16pm2p,null,1430990034,7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,7

You'd say it to a customer, to an adult stranger, your teacher but not somebody below the age of 18, your friends, your family etc. 
In Germany nobody says ""Sie"" to their parents. But I know that my great-great-grandfather had to do so. This must have been at the end of the 19th century, maybe 1880 ...  
German ""Sie"" is of course a polite form but since it is standard use in Germa you usually switch to a less colloquial language to imply an extra level of deference, adding a lot of ""bitte"" and talking a lot in subjunctive form (""could you/could I"", not ""can you/can I"").

true,kinder_jaje,LIEC,Liechtenstein,"I think that, in the past few years (ever since the economic crisis began), the Slovenian people have shown that they have no understanding of economic realities. I don't know if their elites do, maybe the author is right and they're clueless as well, but there's no doubt that the people should not be asked about economic matters for some time. In that sense, the current government is doing the right thing.

Let's see what has happenned in Slovenia. In 2008 the slovenian GDP fell 10% and ever since then it's been in recession. They also had elections that year and elected a socialist government that promissed to keep the welfare state alive. Despite the economic situation the Slovenians even today get a 13th salary, unemployment benefits, benefits for the unemployed spouse, child benefits, free healthcare, free education, students get to work with reduced taxes etc. The largest companies and banks are still in domestic hands despite horrible performance, and whenever a foreign party is interested in buying them, the Slovenian government rallies and rejects the offer. The ""bad loans"" story mentioned in this article is a clear consequence of the NLB being in government hands. The taxpayer *has to* pay its debt. Had it been owned by, let's say, Citibank, then it would be Citibank's problem to pay the debt.

Furthermore, Slovenia is one of the few Eastern European countries that has a large immigrant population, mainly of Serbs and Bosnians. Because of this cheap labour they could build their highways, new apartments and overall the whole infrastructure, for much less money than other countries which had to rely on their own workforce. The Slovenians today admit this. When the economic crisis began, tens of thousands of immigrants lost their jobs and were forced to leave Slovenia. Many of them didn't get paid and still today didn't get their money (we're talking about 3-6 months of unpaid salaries). The disgruntled immigrants returned to their home countries, spread the word about Slovenia, and the country is not as attractive anymore as it once was. 

Now that the Slovenians don't have immigrants working for them anymore, they have to find money to pay for their welfare state from some other source. One way was borrowing money. In 2008 the debt to GDP ratio was at around 20%, today it's 46%, more than double the amount! The socialist government (elected during the crisis) tried to execute a few reforms, but being socialist it was against their nature to do austerity without the people's consent. So there was a referendum about raising the retirement age by 2 years. 72% of the voter said no. Then there was another referendum about reducing the tax privileges of the students that worked. Under the current system the students delayed finishing their studies because they paid so few taxes that, had they changed their statues from student to fulltime employee, they would get a lesser salary. Of course, this was damaging the state because it was collecting fewer taxes. Under the new rules, the students would be limited in how long they can work this way and would also pay more taxes. The voters again rejected this proposal, the damaging old rules remained.

This and other such measures lead to an even more catastrophic situation and the socialist government eventually fell. In 2012, during new elections, the people again overwhelmingly voted for (another) socialist candidate. He eventually failed to create a new government and now they have a right-wing government, which doesn't ask the people anymore. And it's good that they don't.",0,1358422365,null,0,false,0,c7yi8di,t3_16qulb,t1_c7yi8di,t3_16qulb,null,1430990746,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Well obviously I wouldn't do that. The thing is, a single assaulter is clearly an example of a single *bad* person doing something *bad*, at the cost of an innocent person. In these situations, I would help (and have helped) the assaultee (no lethal force has ever been necessary, thankfully). Stop ping a murderer isn't immoral, but war is about tens of millions of people, and it's impossible those are all evil.

&gt; It would be putting the lives of the aggressors above the lives of the defenders

No, because unless in the case of genocide, the aggressors do not want to kill the defenders at all. Genocide is completely different and I fear war is the only answer here. It's like self defence on a very large scale.

&gt; but we have no control over others and people will suffer if you let people do whatever they feel like

Pacifism does **not** mean idly standing by. There's non violent opposition too. Let's say none of the Belgians did anything to help the German invader at all. Would they have been tortured, killed and forced to locate Jews and install the German government? Probably. But I doubt it would have led to the loss of 2% of the male population, what fighting yielded. Perhaps this would have made the war last a lot longer, but I think WW2 wouldn't have taken the lives of 6% of the world's population (which is a mind-boggling number), mostly male of course.

&gt; 'Collateral' is without doubt the worst part of war, innocents being killed.

My point is every foot soldier is innocent. We weren't fighting the Nazi's, those stayed in Berlin. We fought German civilians. The Germans did **not** want to go to war, they had no choice. And adults can be brainwashed too, Hitler had amazing charisma.

If you're talking about real civilians, my grandfather was forced by the Nazi government to make war material. Does that make him a bad person? I don't think so. Did he deserve to die? No! The English probably did, because they bombed him. He survived, but he told me he found a corpse of a German woman outside, with a dead baby in her hands. I understand the necessity of destroying factories that make weapons for the enemy, but can you hail the guys who did this as heroes?

Which means they want to introduce annoying schemes that nobody wants, like data caps, data usage charges and advertising network speeds that only hold up at 4am or something but slow down to a crawl during peak hours. There's a reason we don't have these anymore. Nobody bloody wanted them and migrated to other providers that had simple reliable flatrates. It's completely ludicrous for them to think that after 10 years the same BS will suddenly work again. The only reason they get away with this in the US is the lack of competition.

The real anomaly is that every once in a while we seem to need a technical government to fix all the screwups of our clueless politicians. Of course, the techies will fix the problems, but they won't take any prisoners. They'll just do what makes more sense on a global level, and just fuck over the less fortunate.

That's why we should really be careful with who we vote, otherwise we end up techno-screwed.
