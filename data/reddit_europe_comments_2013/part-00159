true,arkiel,null,null,"Je ne vois pas d'où tu sors ces conclusions. Premièrement, Le camembert ne parle pas du tout des causes d'incarcérations, il concerne les tranches d'ages. Et on y voit que près de la moitié des personnes incarcérées ont entre 18 et 30 ans, un pourcentage bien supérieur aux autres tranches d'ages (toutes les tranches d'age sont séparées par intervale de 10 ans, sauf les jeunes qui ont droit à 18-21, 21-25 et 25-30).

En revanche la sections ""infractions commises"" apporte plus d'informations. Malgré que les sources indiqués dans la section ne font aucune mention des statistiques qui y sont avancées, je vais faire confiance a wikipedia parce que j'ai la flemme de chercher les chiffres moi-même.

On y voit que 13,6% des personnes incarcérées le sont pour infraction à la législation sur les stupéfiants. Ca donnerait un peu plus de 9 000 personnes incarcérées pour ce type d'infractions, sur un total de 67 000 en 2012.

On voit aussi que 22% y sont pour coups et blessures volontaires, mais malheureusement il n'est pas indiqué combien de ces condamnations sont liés à des affaires de drogue. Il est possible que ce nombre ne soit pas négligeable.

Je pense qu'il est très dangeureux de tirer une conclusion sur la population carcérale avec des chiffres aussi superficiels, et particulièrement d'un simple camembert sur l'age de la population.

Today that's simply impossible, despite the standard of living for those in the middle class being roughly equivalent, when corrected for improvements in healthcare and technology. So what happened? Are those improvements really costing each family an *entire extra salary*? Or have the cost of living increased disproportionately to the salaries?

Just thought I'd provide some statistics. The EU has a ~30,000 civil servants compared to the UK's ~500,000 civil servants. The EU budget makes up about 1% of the GDP where as national budgets are all in the region of 40% to 60% of GDP. 

IMO this leads to the EU trying to get a lot more bang for its buck (or Euro) than national governments and it does a relatively good job at this.

true,Taenk,GERM,"For a democratic, European confederation","I will offer another perspective than the article provides. Some of it will be at lower speeds than discussed, but the point ultimately still stands.

My studies are done in a city close to where I grew up and a lot of my friends are still situated there. Close meaning that I can travel here to there in 30min by car. Should I use public transportation it will take a whooping 1.5h for any one way. Taking studies seriously and working a bit to cover expenses makes it virtually impossible to see my friends during the week and over the weekend it is a major hurdle, too. For various reasons there is no improvement in sight. A highway that shouldn't be built here because the people there don't want to have their idyllic lifes with multiple hours commute disrupted by a little noise, a train there that is not allowed to go faster because it is too loud here. And so everyone who does not travel by car is disadvantaged.

But let's switch to longer distances. In the past century some people were very willing to move closer to working opportunities, even moving to foreign countries with great gains. Affordable, fast travel reduces the need to switch domiciles and allows people to look in a larger radius for work. A train that goes twice as fast reduces the travel time by 50% and what is travel time to and from work but time lost living?

Yes, a slower life may be safer but it is also a poorer life. Say I live in Berlin. With the proposed Scandinavian high speed network I could reach Copenhagen in less than two hours. This may be for tourism, because I want to visit a friend, or because I work there and even if it is for just a few months. With a pledge to slower travel I just waste more time in transit or just don't go at all, not enjoying Danish culture, losing a friendship, working at a less attractive place.

Faster travel does not mean a smaller Europe as more territory is lost in transit. Faster travel means a closer Europe as distance is not measured in kilometers but in hours.",0,1375548184,null,0,1375549771,0,cbg7mry,t3_1jmlz0,t1_cbg7mry,t3_1jmlz0,null,1429958321,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Depends on how you calculate.

To be fair, the work W required to move from A to B at velocity v over a distance d can be expressed as W ~ v^2 d though I highly doubt that is what they meant. What is worse is the exponentiality claim which would actually be devestating for faster travel in a fluid medium.

true,mitchese,CANA,Canada,"Is your work permit for any job?  I/we moved from Regina to Cologne in 2010, without any kind of permit (we showed up as tourists and could stay for 3 months).  I spoke a bit of german which helped with finding a job, but I had a job offer within 2 weeks of moving, it took a bit longer to get the work permit in order before I could start working.  Munich is the most expensive city, you might consider somewhere else (Audi is Ingolstadt, which is near munich).  

A lot of your experience finding a job will be based on your education - if you can get it recognized in Germany to be able to work in whatever you want.  There is an IT shortage there still, so if it doesn't work out with the mechanic stuff, it should be pretty easy for you to get a job in IT if you have any kind of experience.

In terms of finding a job - there is the ""Arbeitsagentur"" but from what I understand the jobs there are not particularly great, and if there is a good job the employers' view of the applicants from the arbeitsagentur is a bit biased (most of the applicants are bad, so you'll automatically be lumped in as a bad applicant).  I used monster.de and there is also stepstone which does lots of advertising.  

Expenses - be prepared for your first move to be very expensive.  We live in Cologne which is considerably cheaper than Munich, and our initial expenses were: 

* 3 months rent (approx 1500€) for security deposit.  We'll get this back, but it's tied in an account that we can't access until we move out.
* 1st months rent for rent
* Furniture - we got lots of used stuff from ebay kleinanzeigen (kleinanzeigen.ebay.de - just like Craigslist).  I would guess we spent maybe 600-800€ on basic furniture between ikea and used stuff.
* Many apartments have a ""commission"" that you have to pay to someone for finding your place.  This can be up to 2.38 months rent, so if you want to avoid this search for ads with ""Provisionsfrei"", but these places are in short supply.  We found our place by calling the morning that the ad went up on the internet and viewed that day.  If you wait a few hours, usually they are gone (at least in Cologne).  Even when we viewed it, we said that we wanted to take it - and were put into a stack of about 10 other people that also wanted it.  Somehow (maybe we're extra nice?) we got chosen and got it.
* Some places do not have a kitchen, and you bring your own.  If you have to buy a kitchen, you can find them for as cheap as a few hundred euros for a small used one, and they go up as high as you want.  Search for places with an ""Einbaukuche"" which means the kitchen is there when you move in. This is what we have, and if you're only staying for a year, something you will want.

You will need a german bank account, and we had some difficulty setting one up when we first moved there.  The german credit system (SCHUFA) doesn't speak at all with Equifax, so as a result we didn't have any kind of credit history and couldn't open an account at a number of banks.  We finally were able to open one with commerzbank, and they seem alright.  They don't have any account fees as long as you receive something like 1200€ per month deposited into your account.  When we moved, we shifted some money through currencyonline.com which worked out well.  Basically you buy some euros online (which is a binding contract at that price!), transfer canadian dollars into their canadian account, and they dispatch the euros out of their euro account into your euro account.  They gave the best rate that we could find, and we were happy with their service. It's free if you are transferring over a certain amount, too (but this is a lot of money - something like $10,000-ish canadian)

Ho fatto il dottorato in Germania e mi hanno, sul posto, mandato ai corsi di tedesco (tesi in inglese, ma con 10 pagine di introduzione in tedesco). Il mio compagno, che è russo, ha fatto l'università a Ginevra ed il dottorato all'EPFL: tutti i corsi sono in francese. La conoscenza delle lingue locali ci ha permesso di trovare un lavoro per mantenersi durante e dopo gli studi. 

Il punto di vista delle università svizzere è molto semplice: lo Stato investe un sacco di soldi per avere delle università di fama, il loro costo per lo studente è quasi nullo (le rette sono nettamente più basse che in Italia); da queste università devono uscire studenti preparati ed in grado di integrarsi nel mondo del lavoro svizzero (non si sono investiti tanti soldi per niente), l'integrazione comporta anche la conoscenza della lingua...quindi se non sai la lingua e non la vuoi/puoi imparare, non puoi venire.

true,ThreeEagles,null,null,"Somebody had written that anti-GMO people are ""*anti-science*"".

This is the label often used by GMO PR  to distract from the actual issues at hand. And it gives the impression that GMO companies are all about discovery, about increasing human knowledge and about trying to better our understanding of the Universe, etc (while portraying their opponents as close-minded nutcases). 

Only that's not the case. GMO companies'  aims have nothing to do with science and everything to do with long term business planning. And their opponents are very often scientists themselves. And some will tell you that GMO corporations (and their economic and political allies) are trying to gradually replace nature with various corporately-controlled (generically-modified and then ""copyrighted"") products. 

In other words, they use genetic-alteration as a way to slowly divide the ""rights"" to useful plants and animals among corporations, and to eventually force everybody to go through them (by making it practically impossible to grown anything that is ""independent""). 

By making a slight change in some already existing plant's DNA, these companies suddenly claim to ""own"" the resulting plant type. And instead of bitch-slapping them back to reason, US governments have been cajoled, pressured and/or bribed apparently into allowing (and even enforcing) this. It seems that, totally dependent on corporate sponsorships for their offices, US politicians no longer have the luxury of a conscience. They are almost employees themselves of the corporations that sponsor them.

Europe was more hopeful ... but apparently not!

In any case, it may slowly become less and less legal to grow **any** plant. If and when that occurs, the GMO companies positioning themselves today will have finally ""cornered the market"" on being able to survive! And by then it will be too late to do anything about it. 

If today's ""civilised"" humans had any brains, they would try and avoid such future nightmarish corporate dystopias. Research in the actual pursuit of knowledge would thus be just dandy ... but anyone trying to copyright plants and animals would be considered dangerous criminals.  They would be indicted at the very least for conspiracy to commit crimes against humanity.

Toksa!

Spain  

- Rajoy showed up before the Parliament (temporaly located in the Senate). Extremely pathetic. If you read ""fin de la cita"" (end of quotation) in any comment from a spanish redditor... it's because of Rajoy. The idiot had quotes on his speech, and of course he read these three words that obviously were meant only for him to read. Like a dozen times.

- The 69th anniversary of [the Warsaw Uprising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_uprising)(don't mix it up with [the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising)) Hands down the event of the week. [Here's a video of what happens in Warsaw at the 'W' hour on 01.08 every year](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejd2rsXoQSI)
Two veterans who lived through the fights asked people to leave their political preferences to themselves and not to express them on the cemetery. 
Despite of that on the cemetery of the people who died in the uprising some people booed the politicians from the political party they didn't like. I am not saying that these people who were booed are saints, but on a cemetery? Really?
After the ceremonies on the cemetery an MP told that if the Prime Minister, the President and the president of Warsaw(who are member of the opposing party) don't want to get booed, they shouldn't show up at the ceremonies. 
He also claimed that what other people think about it doesn't matter as his mother was a medic during the uprising, hence what he says is somehow more important.(I am sorry for being so subjective, but for fucks sake...)

- Other people discuss(not on a cemetery and in a more civilised way) if the uprising had any chance of success or if its cost wasn't too high for the benefits it could gain. Most people agree that what these people did was heroic and they deserve great respect for it.

- The Pope is going to visit Kraków in 2016 to lead [the World Youth day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Youth_Day). No surprise here, [John Paul II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_paul_II) whose career as a priest started in the city during the WWII was also the person who initiated the World Youth Day in 1984.

- Tour de Pologne started in France and then continued in southern Poland. It ended on Saturday.

- There were thunderstorms all over Poland. Local floodings, hailstorms, fallen trees. And it's hot again now (up to 35 degrees).

- A lot of people died on roads contributing to Poland being one of the countries with the biggest rate of road fatalities in Europe

- The military police secured  a few hundred litres of wódka on a plane which was meant to transport soldiers of Polish special forces to Afghanistan. 
Morale of the Polish contingent plummets.

- We dug out some more WWII explosives. Our military engineers have been busy lately.

- About 450 000 people had fun at [Woodstock Festival at Kostrzyn nad Odrą](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przystanek_Woodstock). 
The festival is organised by one of the most widely known charity fundations in Poland, [Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Orchestra_of_Christmas_Charity). 
Each year they set a target, like 'saving the lives of children and probiding adequate healthcare for the elderly'(2013) or 'Prevention and early diagnosis of cancer in children'(2009,2010) and collect money all over the Poland with help of volunteers.
They usually help children by buying medical equipment and then letting hospitals using it free of charge. The festival is meant to be a big thank you for the volunteers and you don't have to pay anything to participate. A lot of Germans attend it because [it's right by the border with Germany, relatively close to Berlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostrzyn_nad_Odr%C4%85).

- Yet another man with illegal firearms and explosives was arrested in Kraków. He is connected with the case of Brunon K., who was most likely preparing a terrorist attack against the Parliament.

&gt; dove sta scritto che è illegale rimpatriare tutta la famiglia

Leggo [qui](http://www.studiocataldi.it/news_giuridiche_asp/news_giuridica_13903.asp):

* La Corte d'Appello di Napoli aveva confermato il provvedimento di allontanamento dal territorio emesso dal Tribunale dei Minorenni e contro questa decisione ricorrono i genitori dei ragazzi. Secondo il giudice di merito, infatti: **i gravi motivi connessi all'equilibrio psicofisico del minore straniero...devono essere correlati esclusivamente alla sussistenza di condizioni di emergenza, o di circostanze contingenti ed eccezionali che pongano in grave pericolo lo sviluppo normale della personalità del minore.** Nel caso di specie, invece, si trattava sempre per lo stesso giudicante di un mero disagio generico per i ragazzi e non di un vero e proprio pregiudizio psicofisico.

* Le Sezioni unite della S.C. già con la sentenza n° 21799/2010 avevano affermato in un caso simile che l'autorizzazione, seppur temporanea, alla permanenza in Italia del famigliare del minore **non richiede necessariamente l'esistenza di situazioni di emergenza o di circostanze contingenti ed eccezionali strettamente collegate alla salute, potendo comprendere qualsiasi danno effettivo, concreto, percepibile ed obiettivamente grave che, in considerazione dell'età o delle condizioni di salute ricollegabili al complessivo equilibrio psico-fisico, deriva o deriverà al minore dall'allontanamento del familiare o dal suo definitivo sradicamento dell'ambiente in cui é cresciuto, sempre che si tratti di situazioni che si concretino in eventi traumatici che trascendano il normale disagio dovuto al proprio rimpatrio o a quello di un familiare.**

[Sentenza cassazione](http://www.meltingpot.org/IMG/pdf/cassazione_823_10_190110.pdf)

Leggo infine [qui](http://www.altrodiritto.unifi.it/ricerche/migranti/pratelli/cap2.htm#h1)

* La disciplina inerente l'istituto dell'espulsione è applicabile esclusivamente all'adulto straniero irregolare o clandestino: infatti **con l'introduzione della L. 40/98 e del suo relativo T.u. si è previsto il divieto di espulsione del minore straniero**. L'art. 19 (28) secondo comma 2, lettera a) del T.u., prevede accanto ad altri casi di inespellibilità, anche il divieto di espulsione nei confronti degli stranieri minori di anni diciotto, fatto salvo il **diritto** a seguire il genitore o l'affidatario espulsi (29).
Come per gli altri casi previsti dall'art. 19, comma 2, del T.u., **il divieto di espulsione previsto per i minorenni riguarda tutti i tipi di espulsione (amministrativa o giudiziaria), ad eccezione dell'espulsione per motivi di ordine pubblico o sicurezza dello stato**. La decisione su tale provvedimento può essere adottata solo dal Tribunale per i minori, su proposta del questore (30), c'è quindi un arco di discrezionalità, non sappiamo quanto ampio, del Tribunale che può prevedere tale atto. Per alcuni in dottrina, come Lorenzo Miazzi, (31) giudice presso il Tribunale di Rovigo tale norma dovrebbe essere interpretata, in maniera restrittiva, cioè ritiene che il minore possa essere espulso dal Tribunale per i minori solo quando il questore espelle i suoi genitori o l'affidatario. Si avranno così delle espulsioni ridotte, e questo corrisponde, secondo tale interpretazione, almeno astrattamente, all'interesse del minore.
Nel decidere circa l'adozione del provvedimento di espulsione il Tribunale per i minori dovrà valutare e tenere nella dovuta considerazione sia la sussistenza dei motivi di ordine pubblico e di sicurezza dello stato, per i quali può disporre l'espulsione, come prospettati dal questore proponente, sia l'effettivo interesse del minore, sia l'effettiva necessità e congruità della misura, qualora dalla sua adozione possa derivare una lesione del diritto all'unità familiare. Diritto questo tutelato dalla L. 40/98 ma anche dalla Convenzione di New York sui diritti dei fanciulli. Particolarmente delicate si prospettano soprattutto le decisioni di espulsione da adottare nei confronti di minori stranieri nati in Italia o che comunque abbiano perduto qualsiasi legame significativo con il loro paese di origine.
È bene sottolineare che l'adozione di provvedimenti di espulsione nei confronti dei minori è di per sé vincolata alla sussistenza di motivi di particolare gravità. Trattandosi, infatti di soggetti inespellibili, il provvedimento può essere adottato solo per motivi di ordine pubblico e di sicurezza dello stato, che difficilmente potranno configurarsi nei confronti di un soggetto minorenne.",0,1375573928,null,0,false,0,cbgetp6,t3_1jmqsj,t1_cbgetp6,t1_cbgdimz,null,1429954894,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

true,Adventor,null,null,"Usually german universities get ranked somewhat below the British and American Ivy League universities, however there seems to be always some grumbling about those rankings being rather biased towards english speaking universities. From my personal feel, people with a german higher education seem to be respected in the world. Also, there is a much lesser divide between good and bad german universities compared to America. You can basically get a solid education by picking a university (both normal and applied science) at random.

There is no change of system coming, since we already suffered a big change a few years ago by switching from our old Diplom to a bachelor-master-system. There is still some confusion going on because of that, mostly some universities not having a very solid bachelor-program and being all like ""the bachelor is just a preparation for you REAL (Master-)degree"". However those universities with a solid bachelor-degree will pump enough knowledge into you that you are ready for business even without a master-degree.

Regarding a job: Every CS-Student I know who wanted to work while studying found a job (mostly IT-related). However be warned.. CS is not a easy subject and your professors will assume that you can pour a days work into it. I worked 15 hours per week for a year and it really wears you down. Also, nobody I know had to fully support themselves with their work, it was always either getting some early work experience or earn some additional money on top.

Most of the other questions seem already answered by other guys, so I'll end it with a personal comment. I already slightly touched the subject: Germany has two kinds of universities. The first would be the standard kind you most likely expect. the other kind are Universities of Applied Science (Fachhochschulen). 

Compared to the normal universities they usually offer more guidance to their students, are more practical (and less theoretical). Normal universities often seem to work in a way that just piles a big challenge in front of you, offers you some small pointeres in the right direction (buried in a lot of mumbo jumbo that you will understand several years later) and then leaves you to your own devices. Universities of Applied Science seem to do way more teaching and have a lot more accessable professors.

Normal universities claim to do this because it teaches the students to learn on their own, however I found that nobody leaves any kind of university without learning that. There is always some professor that teaches in a way that is totally incompatible with you, leaving you to learn stuff on your own.

Universities of Applied Science also seem to have way less trouble switching over from the diplom to the bachelor-master-system, because they were already used to preparing students for work in only slightly more time than a bachelor takes.

Universities of Applied Science are also usually very well connected with the companies in town, leading to about 50% of their students having a job before they even graduate.

..well after that kind of praise for Universities of Applied Science I would do you a disservice if I wouldn't mention some downsides. 

If you are considering a career in science, stay away from Universities of Applied Science, normal University is the way to go. Universities of Applied Science used to provide a slightly worse education - same groundwork, but a bit of the top of the moutain was missing. That is no longer the case, since the switch to the bachelor-master-system both normal universities and Universities of Applied Science have to measure up to the same standard (and hand out the same degrees). However, there is still some bias floating around about students from Applied Sciences being inferior (mostly seems to float around normal university students and those that graduated a few years ago, never got me in trouble with employers. Those usually don't care).

Normal university graduates seem to have a slightly higher first salary. From my experience we're talking about a difference of 200-300 €. That difference vanishes mostly after a few years. My personal suspicion would be that students from normal university are better at negotiating ;)

&lt;startedit&gt;Another thing I thought of: Universities of Applied Science might have less courses taught in english language, which might be important for you.&lt;endedit&gt;

One of our biggest miscarriages of justice, ever, came, if not to and end, but to the beginning of the end, if I may paraphrase Churchill.

The serial killer, formerly known as Tomas Quick have now been cleared of the last of the **eight** murders he was convicted of. Now we have a man, Sture Bergwall, who, despite never killing anyone, somehow managed to get convicted for 8 murders, despite a complete lack of evidence. 

We also have eight murders, with no known killer, not even knowing if all of these people were murderd. 

Above all - we are all left with the question - *how could this happen?*. Unfortunately, and one of the biggest failures is that no one seem to have a clear cut answer to that question. It seems to have been the perfect storm of fame hungry prosecutors, incompetent lawyers, idiotic police officers, bad system, horrible doctors etc. However, no one has yet been made responsible, or fired. In true Swedish fashion we now have a committee of some sort that will look into it. 

If anyone wants to read more about it there was an excellent and fascinating (but long) article in GQ about it recently. [The serial killer has second thoughts - the confessions of Tomas Quick](http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201308/thomas-quick-serial-killer-august-2013).

Acceptance is not a problem as far as I remember. They weeded out students who didn't complete enough courses in the first year, but that was very doable if you simply do the work. As a non-EU citizsen, I believe the tuition is 9000 EUR / year. For supporting yourself, I think you can find programming jobs in Germany once yu are there and if you can do some programming.

Right! 

I'm just curious, you may disagree with something but why, for example, this incredulous ... ""***even***"" ... about labelling GMOs? 

Of course that anything with GMOs should be labelled! Otherwise, long term, there will be no way to distinguish GMO from non-GMO use. If we hide it, in the case that something (if anything) is actually amiss with some particular type of GMO, there will be no way to pinpoint the origin of the problem. How can that possibly be a good thing? What’s the matter with you? 

And ... given all the useless and misleading PR, brand-promotion and advertising  crap that's found on food labels ... it's having actual information there that gets you hot under the collar? 

I don't think that's normal.

There is a lot of mutual respect between those two nations and this friendship has been confirmed in history - not only by words, but by actions too. When I visit Hungary everybody screams they love polish guys, and it looks similar when Hungarians visit Poland (they will hear ""Polak, Węgier, dwa bratanki - i do szabli, i o szklanki!"" for thousand of times). I'm writing about it, because it's very unique. Here, in Poland, we are very sceptical about our closest neighbours because of a long history of mutual relations and a lot of polish blood at ukrainian, russian oraz german hands. Don't get me wrong, we don't judge people because of nationality, but they have to earn our trust. But Hungarians we love unconditionally.

What else do I know? Well, I'm afraid - not much. You used to be in some long-term political relationship with Austria and probably you were not very happy about that (but might be wrong). You gave us one of best polish kings - Stefan Batory. You've got pretty cool football team in 50's. You like spicy food and ""gulasz"" (""goulash""?) is some kind of your national dish. Now you have some bad-ass guy as a prime minister, but I really don't know how to judge him. I need a little bit more time to tell he's rather a genius or radical crazy guy. 

I've visited Budapest a few years ago, and I loved your capitol city. I think it's much better than a little overrated Prague. It's lovely and full of great atmosphere. I think I could live in Budapest, it's a little bit warmer than Warsaw, especially in winter I guess. I also traveled your metro. I guess it was just one line, but it's really, really old. But... still better than this crappy building, which uncle Stalin decided to give us in Warsaw.

Oh, you've got 2l bottles of Cherry Coke, which I really adore, but everywhere else there are only 1L bottles. From the other side, my mate bought some kind of vodka called ""Alaska"" and it tasted like feet.

true,BertBrecht,null,null,"Depends very much on what you mean by ""best"". Generally, Universität des Saarlandes (UdS), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and LMU München are among the best. Personally, I am fond of UdS which is often referred to as the ""Computer Science center of Europe"". Its infrastructure is excellent. It has departments and working groups with top researchers in every CS field you can imagine. As a result, you can expect to have a wide selection of classes and you can specialize in nearly everything. Opportunities as research or teaching assistant are great, too. Also, it's classes are mostly in English, but that doesn't really matter. 

Among other good CS universities are TU Dresden, RWTH Aachen. Again, it depends on what you mean by ""best"". It helps, if you know what field you are interested in. 

Currently, I am finishing up my Bachelor's in a CS program at a university that focuses on Computer Graphics and Embedded Systems. This is really annoying, since for most core CS fields (Theoretical CS, algorithms, logic, programming languages etc.) there are classes that only cover the basics. Often, there are no professors specialized in that field so they are taught by one of the plenty Computer Graphics professors. Which is fucking annoying since they really only know the basics of the stuff they are talking about. On the other hand, if you are interested in Computer Graphics, this is heaven. For my Master's I'll be leaving for UdS where I can specialize in every shit I could possibly imagine and work with top researchers in that field. 

(The following is very subjective and not nearly as black and white as I make it out to be. In case of doubt, assume I made everything up.)

I don't care about rankings, but there are definitely differences in approaches to education in Germany and the US. German classes are more theoretical and dry and the general philosophy is ""You're on your own"". In the US, professors are better teachers by a long shot, but the material is a bit lighter and less strict. Homework assignments are often in the form of walkthroughs through elaborate and fun scenarios where it is rather easy to complete them but you really get the big picture with a lot of ""aha moments"".

On the other hand, many of my German assignments assumed I was a robot and fed me a list of questions/tasks without explaining why (""1. Do this, 2. Prove this, 3. Program this, 4. Prove this""). You had to dig for the ""aha moment"" yourself and often it came weeks or months later or there was none. 

A symptom of this is that most students I know (native Germans) prefer English textbooks over German ones as they are easier to read and understand and have more elaborate and engaging examples. 

I don't really know much about admissions for foreign students. Generally, admission in Germany is a joke compared to other countries and admission to CS programs especially is a joke compared to other study programs.Check out the admission requirements for the programs you are interested in. As you have three years before your studies, you have plenty of time to prepare for any specific requirement they have.

*Préparée en secret, la manifestation est un boycott du couvre-feu nouvellement appliqué aux seuls Nord-Africains. Alors que les attentats du Front de libération nationale (FLN) frappent les forces de l'ordre depuis plusieurs mois, l'initiative, non déclarée aux autorités, se veut cependant pacifique. Le FLN, qui y voit un moyen d'affirmer sa représentativité, y appelle tous les Algériens, hommes, femmes et enfants, et leur interdit le port d'armes.*

*À partir des années 1990, ils font l'objet d'un traitement médiatique, puis politique plus important à la suite de la publication d'études historiques, de romans, d'un recueil photographique et surtout du retentissant procès de Maurice Papon, préfet de police de Paris au moment des faits, pour ses actes sous l'occupation allemande.*

Bref, c'est pas une gentille manifestation de gentils arabes, c'est un acte de rébellion orchestré par des terroristes, à la suite d'attentats à l'aveugle contre des policiers, pendant une guerre.

Le couvre feu a été décidé car entre le 15 août et le 3 octobre, il y a eu 33 attaques du FLN et 16 policiers morts à Paris.

Enfin, rien ne vaut cette citation d'un mec du FLN :

&gt;le comité fédéral conduit par Omar Boudaoud se réunit à Cologne et opte pour le boycottage du couvre-feu car l'organisation d'une manifestation de masse serait nécessairement victorieuse : « Si la police laissait faire, l'autorité du préfet serait bafouée.

&gt;As you know, the U.S. has repeatedly advocated that the Holy See **promote genetic modification of seeds as a moral obligation.**

As others have pointed out, the GMO debate offers a few levels which would actually offer a basis for a better way of growing food (or biofuel, which isn't called 'bio' because it takes care for any environmental impact btw). But the notion of Monsanto can hardly be summarized as being interested in making things better, but, as reasonable as this is for a company, to make them more profitable.

It's not like their seeds don't require certain chemicals. They actually do, by design, as Monsanto also sells the necessary crop protection chemicals. Dual monopoly.

**So they environmental value of Monsanto seeds and practices is very open to be questioned and should be separated from the more general debate on the usage of GMO.** Those things *could* be better, *could* cause less environmental impact and *could* form up a solution for certain issues.

Back to Monsanto: From the above quote, trying to sell those things as a moral obligation or a chance to 'feed the future' (which is their slogan) comes in as lobby-ish as can be.

true,jeekiii,null,null,"The patent laws in general:

- It's intended to keep a monopoly for one company if that company invented the product.
- It's supposed to encourage R&amp;D.

However:

- It's often used to sue other companies one does not like (see the smartphones companies suing each other again and again)
- Monopoly is harmfull for economy, so if it's not encouraging further R&amp;D, allowing one to have such power of decision over the price is harmfull for economy.
- A lot of patents are preventing innovation by preventing other to use avaible technology to developp further one.

(I am not saying patent are a bad thing, only that they're badly implemented and should be reformed)

Now, specifically  for GMO crops:

- It's patenting life forms, seems kinda silly to me.
- It's broking an economical model (farmer plant seeds, gets more seeds, use parts of the gained seeds to plant next year).
- It's creating a dependency of the farmers towards the GMO corporations (by not allowing farmer to use the seeds they harvest and forcing them to buy seeds every years to the GMO corp at the price the GMO corp sees fits).

As you can see, the problem is not for companies who would use the GMO's technology to sell the same product, it's farmers who can no longer apply a very old model in which they weren't depending on another corporation's will to have seeds the next year. So, a byproduct of the patent law who isn't intended to do such thing is to modify the business model of the farmers to get them to depend on the GMO corp and to give them money each year.

Some people have been speaking of other problems such as:

- what if the patented GMO seed gets unwillingly crossed with non-GMO seed? Do the corporation get a fee from the farmer who didn't try to get GMO on his field? Is the farmer allowed to get his seed and plant it next year?

true,lordofthejungle,IREL,Ireland,"That's a fair assessment. I just think establishment in Britain aren't looking at the ethics of their attitudes and that's having a knock-on effect on the public (particularly in the south). It's kind of a London attitude too from what I can tell, and the London-centric media scaremonger the rural or regional blocs. 

The other thing is that it's lamenting the policies of the past and creates a culture of holding that against the current beneficiaries, which is unfair if the government/agitators aren't going to have their colonial policies of the past held against them also. If Britain want to take attitudes back in time, they are surely free to do so, but they can't expect to not be held to the history that allowed those attitudes to establish themselves, which is a history of arrogance, oppression, exploitation and colonialism. They also can't just undo citizenship from citizens with foreign ethnicities, which is what the base that motivate these attitudes would find most ideal.

The whole thing reeks of a scapegoat to distract from the real problems in British policy which is a financial system rife with corruption, facilitating global tax avoidance and capital withdrawal, alongside an aggressive foreign policy, both of which have served to generate difficult economic circumstances for the more vulnerable of the British public. Add to that a political leadership (all sides) completely out of touch with the life of the average Briton, and conservative Britain's ability to organise and sanitise their hatred and it makes for disturbingly fertile environment for totalitarianism to recur there.

Now Britain can do what they like domestically, my concern stems from the fact that Ireland's right (which is our entire government and half the opposition too) tends to emulate the disciplinarian attitudes of Britain so it could turn out bad for my own country as a result. They may have relinquished some of our land, but not their influence.

I see ourselves having more in common with other European countries and it makes more sense to work with them rather than the US. 

The media here often quotes things how you had stuff like people not being able to see fruit and vegetables in solely imperial measurements and that metric (SI?) had to be the predominant way with others being allowed to be next to it. Or how fruit and vegetables have to be a certain size to be sold (not sure if that's just pulled out of nowhere and it's just the policy of supermarkets). 

If I wasn't on my mobile phone I would make more of a response. I'm sure it's known that the media here is on a whole, obsessed with being eurosceptic and exaggerates the bad points (when in fact it's the EU that has provided is with rights that wouldn't be guaranteed if we were not subject to it (would look up examples but I'm going by memory, on phone)), whilst being all lovey-dovey to the US and how great they are at being in a 'special relationship' with us. All that done to appeal to the people at the bottoms who take anything the Daily Mail and Sky News tells then. 

I've spoke to my dad about this in the last, and even though he misses the individual currencies of the countries (he worked in a bank for 35 years) and some other things, he sees the benefits of the EU and agrees with me that should this absurd referendum to leave happen, he would vote against leaving and to stay in the EU.

Whatever bad points there are about the EU, the positives far outweighs them. 

I don't mind the EU at all, but I don't really like the euro only because I appreciate individual currencies of countries, but really, that not a bad point in the grand scheme of throngs.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I'm not saying all immigrants don't work. Of course they do. But what is their job? With some exceptions(our respected and beloved minister Kyenge) most do some useless jobs. If you go around in bigger Italian cities you will see immigrants selling cheap bags on the streets. Or selling badly made souvenirs on the beaches.

Italians also do these types of jobs in areas full of tourists, I doubt that most immigrants in Italy and around the world actually have those types of ""useless jobs"". For example if you take a look at the immigrants around Europe you will see that a very small minority actually has those types of merchant jobs. I keep seeing tons of Italians, Portuguese, Spaniards and other nationalities working in the construction business, I doubt thousands of Spaniards are going to immigrate to Germany to sell umbrellas or similar stuff.

&gt;Also are you sure there's only 4 million unemployed people? I'd like a source please, I really need it for personal use. And that only adds to my point. If there are so many unemployed we don't need immigrants to support our economy since we are not lacking any work force. Italians can take all of these jobs.

Here's a [source](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/unemployment-rate). You see, that only shows how hypocritical you are regarding your view on immigrants. You claim they don't work, and then claim that they are stealing the jobs, which one is it now? Also, do you think that the majority of European immigrants in Italy are selling umbrellas in Milan? Illegal immigrants is one thing that you can't compare to the legal ones.

That old story of ""IMMIGRANTS ARE TAKING OUR JOBS"" has been beaten to the ground over the centuries. The reality is that in the South of Italy there are tons of unemployment due to social problems with ITALIANS themselves (Just ask my Sicilian friends) and not with immigrants taking the jobs. The same story goes on in any country with immigrants, but let's just ask ourselves what is really true, because I keep seeing immigrants doing the jobs that the citizens of the country don't want to touch.

I was unemployed for 3 months in Switzerland last year, I saw many examples of people declining jobs because they only earned 21 Fr. an hour even though their benefits were about to end and they would have to get social help... I didn't notice a majority of immigrant unemployed people while taking week long workshops. It was about 60/40 in terms of Swiss/Immigrants, but the thing is, that the Swiss unemployed were searching for higher qualified jobs and in different types of professions, while the majority of the immigrants were searching for more manual work. So you can't tell me that a guy that wants a job in an office in Italy can't find a job because some guy from Africa got a job building a house...

Corporate tax in Gibraltar stands at 10%, and upto 50% for individuals income tax, this makes us a low-tax jurisidiction and not a secretive tax haven - considering especially that we've signed 17 tax agreements (USA, UK, Australia, Germany, Ireland, just to name a few: http://www.oecd.org/countries/gibraltar/ ) in three years and have made it onto the the OECD's Tax White List since 2009: http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/progress%20report%20december%202012.pdf http://www.sanctionswiki.org/OECD_Lists


What hurt's me more is that you claim WE'RE a leech on Spain... EVERYDAY 10,000 Spaniards cross the border in Gib to work, WORK. Something the local government has failed to provide in La Linea De La Concepcion, where the previous Mayer to Gemma Araujo had gotten the town of 65,000 into a per-capita debt of E3,000: http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/gibraltar-s-spanish-neighbor-la-linea-in-crisis-a-840854.html

Notice also, that EACH and EVERYDAY a total of 30,000 people CROSS into Gib, with 10,000 officially working. About 2/3rd of that extra 20,000 are doing nothing but Cigarette Smuggling (and the Spanish newspapers say we are a nation of smugglers, when you'll only see Spaniards with 2 bricks of cigs at the border!), and whilst they make massive mess which the Gibraltarian people pay to clean up we forgive them because of the situation they are in, and the need to find work: read that spiegel article, 'cos each Spaniard makes E4 on the 20 packet carton of Cigs.

And then when it comes to how Gibraltar helps the surrounding Spanish area, just read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Gibraltar#Interaction_with_the_nearby_area

You claim that Gibraltar only survives 'cos it facilitates tax evasion from Spain (whilst they also turned down a tax agreement from us!!!), but you've got to remember that's because there's even more monetary fraud and gangsterism in Spain... where the first cannabis cafes are open and brothels (""puticlub"") are fully legal, and just read any news these days about Spain's political corruption.

You'd be surprised how untrue that is. I have never even in my life seen an Italian do these kind of jobs that don't even provide checks to the government. You can't compare it to construction working since construction working is actually something useful that creates apartments. And while there are non European migrants on construction most of them come from Eastern Europe. Also among the favorite businesses of immigrants is prostitution. The difference between the Spanish immigrant and the African one usually is that the Spanish one has a plan on what to do before he moves to Germany. The African immigrants think more like""Let's get on the boat to Italy and then we'll think about it"".

Also I find that source unreliable. 

&gt;The number of unemployed persons amounted to 3.89 million

&gt;In June, Italy's adjusted unemployment rate fell to 12.1

The population of Italy is about 59 million. 3.9 million don't make 12% of it. Simple mathematics. Point out if I missed anything here.

Which one is it? It's the one they don't work and when they do they work useless jobs that Italians could also do.

And you know what bla, bla, bla Southern Italy. Well I'm from Northern Italy almost everyone I know has a good paying job even as a fishermen. By talking about the social problems of Southern Italy you're just sticking the knife deeper in our bleeding wounds. Do you think we don't know that the Southerners aren't as work loving? Well here's the shock we do know that and it's an old wound. But we still love them and they are good people, kind people. People willing to help. I would give a job to any Southern Italian who needs it instead of a person I have nothing in common with. Immigration is necessary in countries that don't have enough working force and their economy needs it. Well this is not the case here. We have the working force and I am sad for every cent that will go for an immigrant family instead of creating work spots in the South.

Regardless of thinking about it if we went alone, the UK is a major voice in the world and the only realistic way it can get it's word known now is through the combined force through the EU. Without the EU, who are we when there's other powers like he combined EU and china etc? 

People may cling onto the days when we had the empire before it started crumbling around a century ago, but it's not relevant now and people need to realise this and accept that the EU is the only way for our voice to be heard, otherwise we are nothing. Even Obama has said that the UK needs to stay in the EU. 

I assume you're from the UK, but regardless I'm sure you've might know of the people saying we don't need Europe, we have the commonwealth like Australia and Canada to rely on. Realistically though, even with the problems, the EU and working with the people next to us is what we need to do.

I, myself, used to be sceptical towards the EU but I'm sure that's from my interest in our Empire during my school days (19 now). I've since realised that the EU is what we need to be in to have some influence in the world. Experiencing the benefits that it brings as well with freedom of movement and all that is nice as well. 

I'm sure the days of the empire were good for the morale of the British people though. Especially during the wars.

IIRC GMO farmers aren't forced to put label on their product, so from a customer's point of view, the GMO and not-GMO crops are the same, thus, if the GMO's company lower the price enough, it would stop being sustainable for a farmer to buy regular crops.

Using this process, the company doing the GMO can basically destroy competition from regular crops (assuming 90% of the farmers crops are GMO, the remaining 10% would hardly be able to give crops to the farmers at an interesting price. Besides, part of the interest of planting your own seeds is that you don't have to pay it to anyone, it only cost potential money).

The problem here is that the GMO's crops, by having a monopoly, can nearly-forcidly build a dependency from the farmer.

true,amicocinghiale,null,null,"Nella sua recensione Asimov critica il libro su numerosi punti, con motivazioni che però trovo abbastanza pretestuose. Mi scuso in anticipo per il tono a mia volta un po' presuntuoso, ammetto di essere un ammiratore dell'opera e ho scritto questo papiro di getto (c'è un TL:DR in fondo per chi vuole) e non ho intenzione di fare editing dato che non sto scrivendo su una testata ma in un forum :) prometto comunque che, al di là del tono, porto avanti serie motivazioni e critiche al testo.

Per cominciare Asimov prima si lamenta di aver avuto poca fantasia e di aver fatto un copia e incolla della situazione della Russia sotto Stalin, senza tener conto che poi invece lamenta che altri dittatori come Hitler e Mussolini hanno avuto storie differenti, che comunque alla fine qualsiasi dittatore muore ed è poco credibile che una dittatura regga per così tanto, quindi sta praticamente dicendo che manca di plausibilità e che ha avuto troppa fantasia (che si decidesse!). A parte che anche dopo Stalin non è che la situazione in Russia fosse delle più rosee e democratiche, a parte che evidentemente non aveva mai sentito parlare della Corea del Nord, a parte che non trovo nulla di male che un autore si concentri su una tipologia di dittatura e sviluppi temi a lui cari, forse Asimov non aveva capito che le intenzioni di Orwell **non** erano quelle di fare un romanzo fantascientifico (lamenta anche che pretende di esserlo!) ma quello di fare un romanzo dove delle possibili minacce assenti nel presente vengono proiettate e sviluppate nella loro attuazione peggiore e più negativa (dicasi distopia). Asimov più in là lamenta anche che, essendo ormai il 1980, il mondo era ben diverso da quello descritto nel libro! Questo mi fa ancora più pensare che Asimov leggeva 1984 come una predizione, mentre in realtà Orwell con tale titolo non intendeva fare una previsione così precisa e puntuale, solo ambientare la sua distopia in un'epoca né troppo lontana (rispetto al 1948, anno in cui venne scritto il libro, pubblicato nel 1949) né troppo vicina, come a dire ""occhio che c'è un certo andazzo nell'aria"". Ma Asimov salta a pié pari questa possibilità, andando giù duro.

Proseguendo Asimov lamenta delle incongruenze tecnologiche, ad esempio la televisione che controlla le persone, affermando che bisognerebbe mettere cinque persone a controllarne una sola. A questa critica potremmo anche rispondere che, a posteriori, tra NSA e intercettazioni, in realtà ora come ora è possibile tracciare tutta quanta la popolazione statunitense, ma evito la facile trappola di chi ha come noi la fortuna di vedere le cose a posteriori, anche perché una tale critica si trova ad essere assai banale per il solo fatto che basterebbe anche solo *la possibilità* che qualcuno ti stia controllando (quindi controllare un campione di popolazione a rotazione), per poter instaurare un regime del terrore tale. E non ci sarebbe neanche bisogno di fare i precisini con una risposta così, ma ad Asimov piace applicare la sospensione del'incredulità quando più gli piace. Sempre su questa linea critica il fatto delle denunce tra familiare e amici, trovandole implausibili perché alla fine tutti si denuncerebbero a vicenda, ma doveva essere poco informato perché questo è esattamente lo stesso metodo adottato dai tedeschi nazisti e chissà quante altre dittature. Queste sue critiche si scoprono essere quindi gratuite e poco fondate, lasciando fondamentalmente il tempo che trovano. Ma andiamo avanti.

Traspare chiaramente che Asimov ha una visione esageratamente entusiasta e positiva della tecnologia: critica al povero Orwell di non aver inserito computer e robot, mostrando così di non aver capito il genere del romanzo; lamenta che ha poca inventiva semplicemente perché non immagina rasoi elettrici, continuando a non capire che il punto focale dell'opera non sta nella tecnologia. Lo percula anche un po' per la sua visione romantica dei vecchi pennini. Insomma si concentra a criticare dei dettagli che poco hanno a che fare col messaggio e la grandezza di 1984, mostrando una limitata elasticità e giudicando un prodotto esclusivamente secondo i propri canoni, facendo anche una figura un po' barbina a mio parere: traspare infatti la sua smania di demolire l'autore, trattenuta a fatica, facendo il puntiglioso su questo o quello.

Asimov disprezza i personaggi di 1984, reputandoli deboli e stupidi e denuncia l'assenza di un eroe ribelle, che ovviamente ogni tirannia che si rispetti crea. Certe volte mi sono chiesto se Asimov abbia realmente letto il romanzo oppure parli completamente a vanvera: tutto il rischio al quale il protagonista si espone trasgredendo, e tutto ciò che ne consegue, al quale tenta di opporsi strenuamente, non hanno un che di eroico? Oppure Asimov voleva uno Skywalker, spada e pistola laser, a capo di una rivolta? Anche qui fallisce nel capire la struttura di un romanzo al quale Asimov è estraneo. Avrebbe fatto una migliore figura se avesse detto sin da subito ""questo genere di romanzo non mi piace"" invece che ""è un pessimo libro di fantascienza"", genere che, ripeto, non appartiene a 1984. Poi passa a criticare il ruolo della donna che è sminuito, facendo l'occhiolino alle femministe, rimproverando il fatto di non aver sfatato lo stereotipo femminile degli anni 50. Perché un libro deve essere per forza di denuncia per essere bello, mah.

Parlando del Governo presente in 1984, lo trova implausibile per i motivi che ho anticipato prima, ma aggiunge una chicca: l'odio organizzato è ridicolo perché l'odio verso qualcosa è naturale nell'uomo, e arriva addirittura ad affermare che ""* the Nazis organised mass meetings of delirium that every participant seemed to enjoy, but it had no permanent effect*"" infatti ora come ora dopo 3/4 di secolo non abbiamo neanche l'ombra di bande neonaziste. Senza parlare che la *damnatio memoriae* è una forma di mantenimento dell'odio, ed è una cosa che già i Romani applicavano ad arte. Ma no, se lo scrive Orwell deve essere una stupidaggine. E proprio sulla *damnatio memoriae*, che è un dei fulcri di 1984, Asimov si supera in superficialità e faciloneria fine a se stessa: semplicemente afferma che se un fatto è presentato come tale, allora si tende ad accettarlo, e se viene smentito, allora non verrà creduto. Ma è proprio questo il punto Isacco! Chi controlla l'informazione detiene il potere, e 1984 lo fa capire nel modo più efficace e potente possibile, ma no, per Asimov è un concetto così risibile che a malapena se ne deve tenere conto. Ammette poi che i Russi abbiano adoperato questa tecnica, ma aggiunge ""*but the chances of carrying it as far as is described in 1984 seem to me to be nil - not because it is beyond human wickedness, but because it is totally unnecessary.*"" il che vuol dire che secondo il buon Asimov la *damnatio memoriae* non serve a nulla, una tesi tanto audace quanto sciocca a mio parere. Ma anche se non fosse mai accaduta una cosa del genere, il compito e il ruolo della distopia è proprio quello di indicare eventualità e possibilità nelle loro estreme conseguenze, ma Isaac dà sempre meno segno di conoscere il genere.

Continua poi criticando il *Newspeak* il linguaggio del Partito del Big Brother che tende ad annullare concetti pericolosi semplicemente cancellandone le parole. Ma anche qua Asimov fa finta di non capire e fraintende, affermando con sufficienza che mica tutte le abbreviazioni vengono per nuocere. Ovviamente no, ma dai tre quattro esempi che fa dimostra di aver mancato totalmente il senso del *Newspeak* e va ad impelagarsi in paragoni che poco c'entrano col suo scopo. Liquida insomma l'idea come una stupidaggine, non sa però che l'idea è stata concretamente applicata dal Governo Cinese che ha stabilito certe formule e vietato certe parole (vado a memoria, se ritrovo la mia tesina di maturità, che verteva appunto su 1984 e parallelismi col mondo reale, saprò fornire anche delle fonti).

L'ultimo paragrafo sulla situazione internazionale purtroppo non ho avuto la forza di leggerlo, ma qualsiasi cosa possa dire, probabilmente che sia implausibile o poco verosimile, posso rispondere che il resto del mondo in 1984 ha il solo scopo di fornire una cornice lontana a un'azione che si svolge tutta quanta in una città, che è poco inerente al messaggio dell'opera, la cui azione potrebbe benissimo svolgersi in un piccolo stato isolato e sperduto (anyone North Korea?), e per quel che ne sappiamo potrebbe essere l'ennesima bugia del Big Brother, quindi poco ci importa.

Sure, all those qualified workers from Italy that arrive in Switzerland (I've met many) were totally dumb for your country since you know, maybe the lack of infrastructure, widespread corruption and decent salaries in Italy weren't the reason they moved to a land with more opportunities. They really were too good for Italy, like a teacher I had from Napoli, the poor guy just wanted to get wasted by the Camorra, why not stay there?!

true,degoban,null,null,"""Tanto va la gatta al lardo che ci lascia lo zampino."" è perfetto, ma in una discussione forse è meglio se sai che:

- Processo frode fiscale mediaset, se ne parla da un decennio, berlusconi è già condannato in primo e secondo grado. 

- Si punta all'ennesima prescrizione, questione di mesi, ma gli uffici della cassazione **seguendo il regolamento ufficiale** anticipano l'udienza.

- Il pdl blocca il parlamento... così.

- Il processo passa in mano alla sezione estiva che è gruppo misto di giudici scelti a rotazione. 

- Gli capita come presidente della commissione un giudice conservatore della destra che non c'è più, impermeabile alle pressioni. Paura.

- Si spera comunque in un dettaglio tecnico per far rigirare le carte e andare in prescrizione.

- 30 minuti dalla sentenza euforia generale, è trapelata una voce per cui la sentenza d'appello è stata impugnata e dovrà tornare a milano.

- Gli avvocati di berlusconi ridono e scherzano in aula mentre entra la corte, ilarità anche a palazzo grazioli.

- La cassazione trova un errore nel conteggio degli anni di interdizione dai pubblici uffici, ma è la pena accessoria.

- Viene confermata la condanna primaria. Berlusconi è ufficialmente pregiudicato e deve scontare 4 anni di reclusione.

- Berlusconi spara palle in tv, e lancia la novità dell'estate 2013, forza italia.

- Schifani e Brunetta chiedono la grazia a Napolitano... così.

- L'indulto gli toglie 3 anni (se però sarà condannato in cassazione anche per il caso ruby l'indulto viene annullato e se li deve fare).

- Per limiti di età non va in galera, può scegliere tra i domiciliari o i servizi sociali ( legge fatta da lui per salvare Previti. Il caso ruby però non ammette agevolazioni, se verrà condannato andrà dietro le sbarre)

- Gli viene tolto il passaporto civile e diplomatico .

- Le carte del processo tornano a Milano per il conteggio dell'interdizione dai pubblici uffici secondo l'articolo indicato dalla cassazione. Però, una legge votata l'anno scorso ( anche da lui ), gli impedisce comunque di ricandidarsi e dovrà essere espulso dall'attuale parlamento  (condanne sopra i 2 anni).

- Berlusconi inibisce ogni tipo di compassione rilanciando i giudici comunisti, l'italia che odia, e il suo progetto per cambiare il paese con forza italia... nel 2013.

Most farmers don't reuse seed anyway.

Here is one: it is useless and costly. I don't want to pay extra for your paranoia. I personally want that we label organic food (even trace amounts) because it has far less studies showing its inocuity than GMO have.

&gt; Oh, because biological agents are safer and more manageable than chemical or radioactive ones right? 

No, but they work totally differently. If an animal eats radioactive food, you are right to worry about the meat becoming (slightly) radioactive. If an animal eats GMO food, whatever negative property you think GMO food has, it is neither chemical or physical, and does not propagate to the meat (or oil, or skin, or any derived product)

&gt; Your comments, whether sincere or paid for, are quite worrisome. They make it likely that humanity as a whole may one day end up winning a Darwin Award. God help us all.

I'll be more condescending: get some culture in science and critical thinking. See that GMO are neither an agricultural nor a healthcare problem. The Darwin Award may be collectively won by humanity if we keep giving into hysteria with random subjects.

Holocaust my arse ..

**There was no Anne Frank and if there had been, the Zionists who took out the rest of the non Z Jews would have gassed her too!**

&gt;The J's are fond of telling sob stories about how the wicked Nazi's led by wicked Adolph Hitler, did a job on the Jews, except [AH and the Nazi's were Jews](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3347309,00.html), who perped the Holocaust then went on to establish the illegal modern state of Israel.

&gt;It was a Zionist plot to kill those Jews true to the Divine Covenant, by which Allah assures Jews the Messiah will appear, whose purpose will be to restore the fortunes of the Jewish people, and to establish the nation state of Israel, and exhorts them to patience until that time comes.

**Understand this .. Jews infiltrate the political structure of every land that receives them, then write [Jew friendly legislation,](http://www.reddit.com/r/borntoday/comments/1hqe6u/born_today_july_5th_gyula_horn_politician_prime/caxyx3j) while perpetrating massive horrors on the host population.**

&gt;The non Jewish Nazis Ernst Rohm and the SA hierarchy, were slaughtered in the [Night of the Long Knives Massacre](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/BEST-1934-headline-newspaper-HITLER-PURGES-NAZI-PARTY-Night-of-the-Long-Knives-/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/$%28KGrHqR,!rQE+n0KUv%29%29BQcz%28y8y3g~~60_35.JPG) of June 1934, after Adolf Hitler was sworn in as German Chancellor Jan 31, 1933. 

&gt;They did the same in Russia after instituting the False Flag 1917 Revolution, then slaughtering the Bolshevics whose ""Civil Disobedience"" a la the Civil Disobedience [Rabbi Adam Kokesh](http://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughPaulSpam/comments/1hsq0o/bobby_powell_adam_kokesh_is_the_gift_that_keeps/caydsw0) is attempting to muster in the US, brought the sham Revolution to fruition!

&gt;It means they were in total power in Germany and the Soviet Union, no less than in France, England, Japan and the United States then as now, where after the similarly [False Flag Pearl Harbor attack of Dec 7, 1941,] (http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1gw8ac/pearl_harbor_cover_up_1000s_of_messages_were/caozrwx) where there were no enemy planes!

&gt;Hitler who was already at war with France, England and Russia, [declared un winnable war on the United States,](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Hitler+declared+war+on+the+United+States&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a) Dec 11, 1941!

**The Pharisees caused their own people to be gassed in the millions during WW2, the gassings were selective, only some Jews were gassed!**

&gt;Witness Moshe Dyan Kaplan’s claim to be a Pharisee, and his contempt for the Jews who were gassed, Cheesies he called them .. Kaplan was a RAAF bomber pilot in WW2, who had flown in the 1945 air raid on [Dresden](http://julius-hensel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dresden-14-2-1945.jpeg), who says his Amsterdam family emerged unscathed.

&gt;After the war he flew Lockheed Electra’s for KLM in Holland and for Lufthansa .. he was the son of a well established Jewish family with antecedents in Johannesburg South Africa, in Amsterdam and in Western Australia, later he was a pilot in New Guinea and dabbled in pawnbroking.

&gt;He was the image of the actor who played [Emmanuel Goldstein](http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9674/goldstein.jpg), in Michael Radford’s 1984 movie 1984, starring John Hurt and Richard Burton, when I asked him how Radford obtained the footage, and under what circumstances it had been shot, he remained unforthcoming and seemed amused!

**After the war he returned to Amsterdam .. I said it must have been heart rending to go back to empty rooms and deserted halls, since Hitler’s men had their way!**

&gt;He said it was good, I said sure but what about all his friends and rellies, he said they were fine, I said that they could not have been fine, since Hitler had the whole lot rounded up and sent to Auschwitz. 

&gt;Indeed The Diary of Anne Frank, a tale of oppression of Jews by the Nazi’s was set in Amsterdam, as well Stanley Kramer’s great movie [Ship of Fools](http://mubi.com/films/ship-of-fools), based on the true story of Jews fleeing the Nazi’s, had its culmination in that city where the ship finally docked.

&gt;After having been turned away from Havana Cuba and from New York, the passengers themselves speedily transported to Auschwitz gas and death .. Moshe nodded sagely, he told me he was a Pharisee..

&gt;That the Jews of Amsterdam as depicted in The Diary of Anne Frank, were certainly Jews however were not in the same category as him.. they were he told me called Cheesies, since their diet consisted largely of that product.

**That they were missing from the community because they had indeed been gassed, he gave me to understand as far as he was concerned, they were neither missed nor mourned.**

&gt;View the Holocaust as a collaboration of high ranking Pharisee Jews, who provided the finance, the uniforms and the marching songs, and the Nazi’s who would do the dirty work, to reduce the number of those Jews who might if they had the numbers, declare the day of the Pharisee at an end.

&gt;And to clean up any racial minority or dissident group, who were perceived as a threat, or were seen as capable of becoming a threat at some time in the future, so the commos, pamphleteers, whacko’s, crazies and the lunatic fringe, were all bundled in with the Cheesies, Gypsies, Russians and Poles, and in Hitler’s words exterminated.

&gt;After each phase of dirty work proceeded in a master plan devised by the Pharisees, the thugs had carried out the dirty deeds were themselves murdered, Ernst Rohm leader of the thug SA movement, murdered with numerous of his thug mates, in the in June 1934 [Night of the Long Knives Massacre.](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/The-Night-Of-The-Long-Knives-ADOLPH-HITLER-Hermann-Goering-NAZIS-1934-Newspaper-/00/s/NTEyWDY0MA==/$%28KGrHqJ,!rIFBPSRPY,LBQYDwbz+cQ~~60_35.JPG)

**The bully boys who did the hands on jobs of thuggery, the scabs of their day, witness the 1929 murder of numerous members of the Gas Fitters Union in Germany.**

&gt;Deeds that were done to empower the Nazis after they had emerged as a political force, with Hitler at their helm in the late 1920’s, murdering, bashing, extorting, and thugging their way along, until the Nazi’s gained absolute power in 1933.

&gt;Then witness the testimony of [Katherine Schweitzer](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/search?q=Katherine+Schweitzer) a Jewish lady from Budapest, whose family of fourteen was arrested in 1944, by a Jew member of Horsha the Hungarian thug police, and deported to Auschwitz.

&gt;Who told Australian 60 Minutes reporter Richard Carleton, the Jew who arrested her was living a few doors up on the same street in Sydney Australia, her murdered body was discovered in a wheely bin inside her high security Sydney apartment, December 28, 2006.

[According to Alex Jones,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAWf4d4hVtw) George Soros then in his teen years, ""cataloged"" the possessions of Jews deported from Budapest at that time .. we say he was ""hands on"" in her case!
