&gt; 1) How long did it take you from first planning to actually moving there?

It took about a month to process my work permit, and another month to actually physically move.

&gt; 2) Were there any unexpected expenses?

Most of what I shipped over were books and CDs (protip: don't bother shipping CDs, if you even own any in the year 2013).  It didn't occur to me at the time that furnishing a flat from scratch is *really expensive* even if it's all the cheapest crap Ikea sells.  If I were to do it again, I'd at least ship as much kitchen utensils as I own, as there are so many little things that you find yourself needing on a Sunday morning when all of the stores are closed.

&gt; 3) How hard was it to get a permanent visa?

After paying into the social system for 5 years, one gets permanent residency in Germany.  That's easy enough.

No one is given an immediate permanent residency visa, except maybe for extremely rich people (who are probably sports stars).

&gt; 4) What were the major culture shocks?

I've traveled to far more culturally shocking parts of the world than Germany, so there weren't that many.  Primarily it took a while to get accustomed to German directness in the workplace.

&gt; 5) How did you find a job?

I already had one when I moved.

&gt; 6) Was it easy to make and find friends?

Nope.  Once you're out of university, in any country, it's difficult to make new friends if you don't play team sports or have some other hobby where you regularly meet the same people.  Friendships formed at work are difficult to take outside of the workplace, and I mostly spent time with people I met at my language courses, but friendships based solely on the shared experience of being an immigrant don't usually stand the test of time.

I won't lie - moving to a foreign country can be a difficult and lonely thing.  But if you're the sort of person who can handle it (and I've known so many other foreigners who couldn't), it's worth it in the end.

&gt; 7) Why did you pick the country you moved to?

true,amendment64,UNSA,United States of America,"American POV here, but I don't want the European welfare model in any of its many forms because my government has proven time and again to be incompetent with the funds we give them.  Hell, so have many European governments for that matter.  They abuse it, waste it on pet projects, or spend it on war, and I am unconvinced that the European model of welfare has done anything but increase European debt.  I don't see europe recovering from their financial crisis anytime soon, and IMO its because you guys won't talk about welfare reform.  And god forbid America ever give up on empire building and policing the world because then Europe would have to build and sustain their own armies and pay for them themselves.

Ok, now bring on the downvotes, I'm ready....

**EDIT:** For clarification, I think some folks are getting the idea that I support my nations military adventurism.  I don't.  The US currently has over 900 military bases in over 140 nations worldwide.  Its absurd.  This is a large part of our own fiscal crisis, and our politicians refuse to cut any military spending.  Personally, I think we should close *all* of these overseas bases up and let those individual countries take care of themselves.  If that happened, I think a consequence would be increased military spending in Europe(as well as other places around the world), though I could be wrong.  But the US won't be closing bases anytime soon.  Unfortunately our politicians are too hungry for conflict.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; The thing is you can't throw money at people that are in a unstable state of mind, being unemployed and feeling useless and depressed increases your chance to use drug, then you develope a habit, stay on unemployment and welfare and just live off the street doing drugs and doing criminal acts.

No, when you're on crack your ability to find and hold a job decreases.

I'm not sure what you suggest. Don't give the unemployed money, because their situation sucks and that *might* lead *some of them* to use drugs? Because, they get so much that they can't think of anything better than to blow it on coke when they normally wouldn't? Alcoholics sell their food stamps because their addiction has a higher priority than the prospect of getting food at the end of the month. And unless you have the treatment facilities to take care of them, that's what they *should* do -- one out of three alcoholics who withdraw without medical supervision dies. 

&gt; Of course there is always going to be people who need help with transition, but money isnt help.

It helps a great deal when you need to buy food for your kids and yourself, have to pay rent and utilities, and need transport to get to job interviews. That's the bare minimum that needs to be covered, otherwise you *will* have crime.  
Yes, it's necessary to spend money on training the unemployed (as well as on treatment centers for addicts and accessible healthcare e.g., for the depression you mentioned), but not *instead* of that little they get through food stamps.

Germany spends [1.7% of GDP](http://stats.oecd.org/BrandedView.aspx?oecd_bv_id=socx-data-en&amp;doi=els-socx-data-en) on unemployment benefits, and I wouldn't call our welfare state particularly generous. In the US, it's 0.7%. For housing, it's 0.6% for Germany, ""no data exists"" for the US. Active labor market programs: 1% vs. 0.2%.

I think it's safe to say you don't have your high crime rate because you spend *too much* on welfare, or because your unemployed are too well off.

There are great views of Florence, and a small patch of forest you can chill near if you're city-ed out. I think there's also a roman ampitheater, but I didn't stop there. 

I also liked the banks of the Arno for similar reasons- I studied abroad in Florence, but grew up in the country, needed a little bit of nature. If you go one bridge east of the Ponte Vecchio, you'll find the Ponte Alle Grazie. Go to the Oltrarno side of the bridge and take a left. Shortly down this road is a little outlet to a pleasant grassy area. If you stay on the Santa Maria Novella side of town, go to Cascine instead. The tram will take you there easily. I never went there, but passed through it and heard that friends loved it. 

The profumeria near Santa Maria Novella- don't remember the name, but it's on Via della Scala between the train station and the Santa Maria Novella church. You can smell it from the sidewalk, and it's interesting to walk through or to shop in, if you've got enough money. 

Mercato Sant'Ambrogio on the eastern side of the city. Going there will get you into a less touristy side of town, you can pass through the antique market on the way there, and it's interesting, pretty, a cheap place to get a meal/produce/snacks, etc. Everyone goes to the Mercato Centrale, but I never saw other Americans/tourists at Sant'Ambrogio. 

The synagogue in Florence is also near the market. I have a thing for religious sites despite not being religious, and I thought the synagogue was gorgeous. No pictures allowed, unfortunately, but it's etched in my mind. 

Everyone recommends the hot chocolate in the Piazza della Signoria, but my favorite in town was at a place called meykadeh on via dei Pepi. Don't know that they'll have it in July, but if they do, stop by. They're also a little library, and they have a stash of bring one, leave one books that they won't mind you reading. 

For accommodation, I'd recommend trying couchsurfing. I met some of the couchsurfing crew through events in Florence, and they seemed great. Plus, I did it in Amsterdam and Istanbul and both were great experiences. 

For food... my host family took me to two places they really enjoyed and recommended. One was Trattoria i Fratellini on Via Ghibellina, and the other was 5e Cinque on Via dello Sprone- that street forms a little Piazza with Via Toscanella, and the restaurant is on the corner. There's also a little gelato place across the Piazza. I'd say it's within the top three I tried in Florence, but it's hard to say because I only had it once. Would recommend that place for creative flavors, along with Festival del Gelato on Via del Corso (about 1.5 blocks from Piazza della Repubblica) and Gelateria dei Neri on Via dei Neri (near Santa Croce, my personal favorite). Also, I loved Trattoria Anita (Corner of Via del Parlascio and Via Vinegia), but I know some Italians scoffed at it. I thought it was delicious, I liked the service, and it fit a student budget. 

Hope this helps. Feel free to PM if you'd like any more info.

It stabilised the economies downward spiral, but now there is need for large government investment to stimulate a stagnant model. The situation has changed but you can't blame the government for adopting the austerity measures when things went to shit. 

In Australia we're getting ready for major cost cutting measures because our current governments increased borrowing and spending has bitten us in the arse. It took a while, but the economy has fallen to around 3% real growth and its stalled. This years budget went from $1b surplus to a $17b deficit in a matter of weeks due to shitty forecasts.

The almost canonical [Canadian example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincome) saw a reduction in time spent working under certain conditions. Then again, reducing time worked is a complex issue seeing as there are fixed costs for the employer per employee thus incentivising him to longer the work week, ultimately allowing reduction of working hours by law. But this is an other issue altogether.

Maybe s/he isn't suggesting as much as pointing out a problem?  

If you are looking for ideas, the core is: *money isn't help*   

You have to look beyond the current economic model, stop seeing it as inevitable or god-given. Why do you *need to buy* food, rent and utilities? 

Corporations have a good model to shed social, responsibility: we are only doing what the market demands, if we don't someone else would, we are only responsible to out stockholders, etc. Government handing out money to fix problems is kind of denial of responsibility as well. But somehow it's still the responsibility fo consumers and welfare recipients to make things right. 

If the system as a whole isn't working out for so many, we have to accept it's a systemic rather than an individual problem.

I would, well, toy around with providing *unconditional base services*, rather than base income income: free public health care, public transport, public (higher) education etc. pp. It is problematic to keep these services functional, draw limits what to do and what not (free homes? food?), and adopt to social and technological changes.

Secondo me, il problema vero è la disuguaglianza che quotidianamente le donne in Italia subiscono da parte del potere prevalentemente maschilista. La cosa tragica è che molte donne perpetuano questo tipo di potere a scapito delle altre (e di loro stesse) per mantenere una posizione che viene loro concessa.

Il rimetterci in denaro e dignità con i posti di lavoro più difficili da trovare e meno pagati, in salute e vita per mano di persone violente che pensano di avere un diritto di proprietà su altre persone è, sempre secondo la mia personalissima opinione, diretta conseguenza di questa cultura.

2) Coffee shops in bookshops (this was new for me in the '90s)

4) I was carded in pubs, but I was always let in even if I didn't have any ID with me.

5) Homeless people

6) Drive-thru ATMs

7) People eating and drinking while walking in large cities.

8) Students eating and drinking in the classroom at the university (in some places it's forbidden though).

9) Drinking coffee with your meal at lunch.

10) You can't drink alcohol on the street (unless you're in New Orleans). I finally understood why people in American movies always kept their booze bottles in brown paper bags.

11) People were surprisingly warm and welcoming.

12) Adults wearing shorts as soon as the temperature rises above freezing (this was in Colorado).

13) Tipping

14) All rental cars are auto shift. I had to ask the rental car attendant how to drive them.

true,glec,SWIT,Switzerland,"Tell me another country where around 70-80% of teenagers with 16 get a 3-year on the job training. That's the biggest strength of switzerland. In other countries almost everyone stays in school at least until they're 19,20. That's around the time lots of them already should've moved out but they can't because the only jobs that offers them advancement are shitty-paid internships. In switzerland, you've got 3 years of job experience and in most cases, the company at which you did the apprenticeship keeps you. So you can move out easily with 19/20 and because you don't have a family yet, you can spend lots of money.
This results in switzerland having a highly qualified workforce and whereas a 22-year old european is still looking for internships and living with his parents, the average 22-year old swiss is fully trained, has 5 years of job experience and a lot of money at his disposal.

I'm not trying to diminuish tax evasion here, but a lot of people just don't look at the strength of switzerland's economic system and just dismiss it as a 'tax haven full of rich people'.

Par contre, la loi ne parle pas de pratiques sexuelles. C'est aussi pour cela qu'il n'y a pas de discrimination envers les homosexuels.

&gt;tu n'argumente pas sur le bien fondé de la loi

Si, le mariage est une mauvaise chose. Quand on demande le mariage pour tous, la moindre des choses, c'est d'expliquer pourquoi on le veut. L'argument ""c'est pas juste les autres ils peuvent et pas nous"" ne me permet pas de dire que le mariage est une bonne chose.

Comme le démontre les manifestations certains des citoyens français pensent que la Loi française peut les favoriser or la Loi est pour tous.

Auf der einen Seite sagst du der Islam wäre ""antidemokratisch"" und würde eine Diktatur des Islam herbeiführen auf der anderen Seite ist diese Diktatur ja was gutes was durch die barbarischen Revolutionen vom Islam niedergerungen wurde als er zur Demokratie strebte? 

Der Unterschied zwischen der prowestlichen Mubarak Diktatur und einer Diktatur unter der Scharia in Saudi-Arabien sind für dich das Gleiche und du erkennst denn Unterschied nicht? 

Die Revolutionäre lösten eine Diktatur ab, die ihnen bestimmte Reche garantierte und ihnen Freiheiten zugestand, die sie unter der Scharia nie wieder erleben werden. ^

&gt;Paradox oder? 

Nein. Selbst grundelgendes Leseverständnis gepaart mit Allgemeinbildung löst dieses Paradoxon auf. Beides fehlt dir.

&gt;Genauso Paradox wie die Miliarden Muslime die friedlich unter uns leben und uns nie etwas tun werden. Auch wenn sie regelmässig Beten und in die Moschee gehen.

Du zeigst, dass du nicht einmal begriffen hast wogegen sich die Kritik richtet. Nicht mal generell. 

Es geht nicht gegen die Moslems, sondern den Islam. Das Problem sind nicht diejenigen, welche den Islam als Lifestyle empfinden, sondern **dass der Islam die Rechtfertigungen zu Menschenrechtsverletzungen, Mord, Pädophilie, Hass, Sklaverei, Homophobie(Negativliste lässt sich beliebig fortsetzen) enthält und sich darauf berufen werden kann und wird.** 

Dagegen richtet sich die komplette Islamkritik. Niemanden interessiert der friedlich vor sich hinbetende Moslem. Es geht um den Islam an sich. Ohne diesen gebe es keine Rechtfertigung für den islamischen Terror und den damit einhergehenden Verbrechen, Abspalten von ganzen Bevölkerungteilen in Parellelgesellschaften, schlicht all die negativen Folgen die der Islam eben so mit sich bringt. 

Der Islam ist es im übrigen auch, der verhindert dass die muslimische Welt einen kulturellen oder wissenschaftlichen Beitrag zur Entwicklung der Menschheit liefert, seit mehreren hundert Jahren. Milliarden Menschen hängen diesem Glauben an und von denen kommt nichts. Keine Forschungsergebnisse, keine Produktivität, keine Erkenntnisse, nicht einmal philosophische Gedanken.

Natürlich willst du gleich wieder schreien ""Menschenhasser, man kann doch nicht alle über einen Kamm scheren bla bla bla.""

Tu ich gar nicht. Ich weiß das diese Menschen dazu in der Lage wären, einzig der Islam hält sie zurück.

Also nochmal zum Mitschreiben: Islamkritik richtet sich gegen den Islam, nicht gegen die Moslems.

Ich frag mich wirklich ob dir das nicht klar ist, oder du hier wieder rumtrollst. So doof kann man doch eigentlich nicht sein und das nicht verstehen. Das ist doch offensichtlich, dass hier keiner die Menschen kritisiert.


&gt;wie kann das sein? Eigentlich müssten sie uns doch alle Shariatisieren und unsere Demokratie niederringen??

Nun, da schauen wir doch mal in den Koran und siehe da, genau das ist das Ziel. Erneut, nicht dass du hier wieder in Schnappatmung verfällst: 

Der Islam rechtfertigt das und ruft dazu auf. Jeder, der diesen Unsinn unterlässt, steht nicht in der Kritik, sondern der Islam als Idiologie.

&gt;Ich weiss es ist schwer weil es den elementaren Widerspruch zur islamophoben Weltanschauung beinhaltet aber ich sehe so gerne wie ihr zuckt während ihr versucht drum rum zu reden :]

&gt; Integrating research and theory on objectification and person versus object recognition, we examined whether sexualized women, but not sexualized men, are recognized in the same way as objects are. According to objectification theory (Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997), female bodies are scrutinized and evaluated to a greater degree than male bodies are, which leads to sexual objectification of women. Defined as viewing or treating an individual as a sexualized body, or as sexualized body parts, available for satisfying the needs and desires of other people (Bartky, 1990), sexual objectification has been recently operationalized by portraying the target wearing underwear or a swimsuit.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; the spanish government is working on a new law that would allow businessmen to open a pharmacy without having a pharmacy PhD

About time!

&gt; The problem is that, under that same law, engineers will now able to project buildings, something that until now proper architects were able to do and is pretty much akin to having a nurse doing the job of a surgeon.

Not quite sure what you mean by ""project buildings"" but to be clear, liberalisation should not mean no regulation only that wherever possible regulation is kept to a minimum. In the example you give ther eare countries the world over that manage to have private companies operating pharmacies and building construction properly regulated. So, Spain is not on the cutting edge of legislation here. 

Some regulation (banking laws spring to mind) needs to be altered as the world evolves and this should not be seen as a bad thing. The worst case we get is when people vie for protection and thus crowd out others to protect their interests. America for all its faults has a better approach than Europe in my opinion - they allow things to fail rather than legislate to death in the first place. Europe is a very risk averse place. 

&gt; And all that talk about competition is really incredibly nice until you realise that for some of us down here what it means is that soon enough we'll need to have the same working and salary conditions that India, Bangladesh or China in order to be competitive enough.

Find me somewhere where it says that peoples of the EU are ordained to have a better life than other people. Or that the EU is entitled to benefits that others can only dream of. Please do so as I'd be incredibly grateful. 

Or perhaps we need to realise that we (Westerners) are in a very fortunate circumstance because of our history and, in a few too many cases, because of the questionable moral legacy we inherited from Emprires and exploitation of others.

We need to compete with those countries you so condescendingly dismiss because oddly enough they would like to have the quality of life that we enjoy. And why shouldn't they?

If we are clever this need not be a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero%E2%80%93sum_game) but it does require that we extract our heads from our collevtive arse and invest in the right things for the future - education being the most obvious and stop pissing money away on idiotic things like CAP. 

Between automation and globalisation the lot for the unskilled worker is a grim one of service industry low paid job (waitor etc) or unemployment. As it stands society is going to have to accept that the unskilled will be unemployable in the near future simply because in order to simply maintain our quality of life we will need to create ever more skilled jobs. What's the point of competing with China (1 billion people) on labour cost? We can't win that battle and keep what we have. 

Protectionism will go so far, in that the environment and other concerns are valid and should be taken in to account. But protectionism to protect workers from competition will only hurt the EU in the longer term. Sure, one maybe 2 generations will get lucky but we'll fade. 

Life is a competition, one for scarce resources. It need not be Darwinian in the sense of the survival of the fittest as we are moving away from hot wars and direct conflict, but the period of (relative) peace and prosperity is something of an anomaly and we would do well to remember that in the living memory of our grand parents there have been global wars and tragedies that most of us today cannot begin to imagine.

Indeed I didn't have any problems finding work as an engineer here in the Netherlands. However, I notice a difference when it comes to emigration to France. Most Portuguese emigrants that go to France are uneducated, and go there to work on anything at all. They earn the minimum wage for 10...20 years and then come back. And, usually, they don't evolve that much. I've been there and it's like Portugal in the 70s. 
So, as an educated emigrant, you're the minority. And, as a minority, it's hard to distance yourself from the stereotype.

Now, don't get me wrong, I agree completely with you that it's basically impossible to find a job in Psychology, not only in France but mostly over all Europe. However, the truth is that that's not what she's looking for. She's just looking for a way to have a career, to be able to grow as a professional and not be stuck in a job that she doesn't like and that she can't really ""evolve"". 

As for your suggestion, I've been thinking about doing that, specifically helping her go through a cooking course or something like that, more practical and less dependent on age.

That is not liberalisation of labour market - that is what happens (among other thing) when you are in a downward spiral and *hasn't* liberalised many of the rigid laws that southern Europe has. For example, to start a company in Denmark, you need to go online. How many permits do you need in Spain? How long does it take? How many layers of bureacracy do you have? How many people, public worker for example, basically were unfireable before? 

You are mixing up what happens in a recession with liberalisation of labour laws and a rigid bureacracy. [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalization)

Ach so und du denkst du könntest dir rausnehmen zu urteilen welche DIKTATUR besser ist für die Menschen vor Ort? Basierend auf was? Warst du zumindest mal in Ägypten oder hast du auch nur mit einem Ägypter gesprochen? In Saudi-Arabien warst du offensichtlich noch nie weil ich mir nicht vorstellen kann wie man zu solchen Schlüssen kommen kann. 

&gt; Nein. Selbst grundelgendes Leseverständnis gepaart mit Allgemeinbildung löst dieses Paradoxon auf. Beides fehlt dir.

Ich glaube wenn du etwas gezeigt hast im Verlauf dieser Diskussion war, dass du schon mal nicht in der Position bist über irgendjemanden oder irgendwas zu urteilen. Wie wäre es noch mit ein paar Beleidigungen vom Schulhof? 

Bleib beim Thema und mach dich nicht doppelt lächerlich. 

&gt; Es geht nicht gegen die Moslems, sondern den Islam. Das Problem sind nicht diejenigen, welche den Islam als Lifestyle empfinden, sondern dass der Islam die Rechtfertigungen zu Menschenrechtsverletzungen, Mord, Pädophilie, Hass, Sklaverei, Homophobie(Negativliste lässt sich beliebig fortsetzen) enthält und sich darauf berufen werden kann und wird.

Jetzt kochen aber die Emotionen wieder hoch hm? Wird es das? Wo wird das? Warum haben die es nicht einfach schon vor 100 Jahren gemacht? Warum tun es DIE MEISTEN MUSLIME nicht? Warum drehen die Juden nicht genauso durch obwohl das Alte Testament nicht besser als als die paar Suren die du sicher als Taschenbuch immer dabei hast.

&gt; Dagegen richtet sich die komplette Islamkritik. Niemanden interessiert der friedlich vor sich hinbetende Moslem.** Es geht um den Islam an sich.** 

Das ist keine Kritik. Das ist HETZE. Kritik braucht keine Verallgemeinerungen. Du agierst hauptsächlich damit.  Ersetze mal Islam durch Judentum und schon sieht das ganz anders aus oder?

&gt; Ohne diesen gebe es keine Rechtfertigung für den islamischen Terror und den damit einhergehenden Verbrechen, Abspalten von ganzen Bevölkerungteilen in Parellelgesellschaften, schlicht all die negativen Folgen die der Islam eben so mit sich bringt. 

Wie ich schon oben sagte, es aber anscheinend ebenfalls von dir unverstanden übergangen wurde: die Gründe für die Leute sind vielfältig. Das geht von simplen territorielen Problemen bis zu Hungersnöten bedingt durch zu hohe Lebensmittelpreise (Der Arabische Frühling fing damit an). Es ist vollkommen egal welche Religion die Leute haben. Sie wären an dem gleichen Punkt ebenso hungrig. Leute aufzuhetzen ist da kein Problem. Wenn du keine Religion zur Hand hast, nimmst du halt Rasse oder politische Einstellung. Da kennst du dich sicher auch gut aus mit.

&gt; Der Islam ist es im übrigen auch, der verhindert dass die muslimische Welt einen kulturellen oder wissenschaftlichen Beitrag zur Entwicklung der Menschheit liefert, seit mehreren hundert Jahren. Milliarden Menschen hängen diesem Glauben an und von denen kommt nichts. Keine Forschungsergebnisse, keine Produktivität, keine Erkenntnisse, nicht einmal philosophische Gedanken.

Oh Gott jetzt wirds echt übel. Welchen Beitrag hat den die Katholische Kirche gehabt in den letzten Jahrhunderten? Wtf redest du da für einen Stuss?? Willst du sagen es gibt keine Künstler, Philosophen, Wissenschaftler die Moslems sind?!?! 

&gt;Nun, da schauen wir doch mal in den Koran und siehe da, genau das ist das Ziel. Erneut, nicht dass du hier wieder in Schnappatmung verfällst:
Der Islam rechtfertigt das und ruft dazu auf. Jeder, der diesen Unsinn unterlässt, steht nicht in der Kritik, sondern der Islam als Idiologie.

Zuerst: DU und deine rassistische Hetzmeute sagen das.

Wie erklärst du dir, dass so VIELE so UNGLAUBLICH VIELE (der Islam ist die 2. größte Religion der Welt. Sie sind ÜBERALL) nicht dieser angeblichen KERNBOTSCHAFT des Islam folgen? Nichtmal annähernd. Sie denken nichtmal drüber nach. Wie erklärst du dir das? Wie rechtfertigst du auf Basis von Minderheiten deine verallgemeinernde Hetze gegen den GESAMTEN Islam? Verstehst du was ich sage oder soll ichs noch fett machen? 

Nochmal in eifnachen Worten: Wenn der Islam allen vorschreibt, dass sie böse sein sollen und sich kaum jemand dran hält, warum sollte der Islam so eine Gefahr sein?

Mal abgesehn davon: wo ist die Gefahr für DICH? Wo bist du den vom Islam so gefährdet, dass du dich zum Kreuzritter des Abendlandes aufspielen musst?

&gt;Leider sind die Islamkritiker nicht die, die auf der Straße stehen und Schilder mit ""Death to all Muslims"" hochhalten, sondern die, die durch den Islam beispielsweise ihr Recht auf freie Meinungsäußerung gefährdet sehen, weil sie in Kunst und Satire eben nicht mehr alles sagen dürfen, ohne dass am anderen Ende der Welt die eigenen Landsleute sterben.

Ach ja? Fjordmann und die kleinen Amokläufer sagt dir sicher absolut gaaaaarnix oder? Die Faschisten haben damals genauso angefangen wie ihr Pack und erspar mir dieses Geschwätz mit der Meinungsfreiheit. Die Karrikaturisten haben doch irhe Meinungsfreiheit ausgeübt sonst hätte die ach so lustigen Comics niemand erst gesehn. Du hast noch immer die Freiheit alles zu malen und zu schreiben. Du hast nur kein Recht, dass der Staat dich vor jedem Kritiker schützt den du damit erregst. Es hat genausowenig mit dem Islam an sich zutun. Sonst wären ja ALLE Muslime auf ihn losgegangen und es würden ALLE Muslime jeden jagen der auch nur irgendwas gegen den Islam sagt oder tut. Ich versteh nicht wie der Unterschied zwischen Verallgemeinerung und Hetze und sachlicher Kritik nicht in dein jugendliches Gehirn reingeht. Dabei sagt man doch die wären noch formbar...

Piu' che altro si sta ingigantendo e deviando un problema che gigante e deviato non e': si arriva a dire che un uomo uccide la donna ""in quanto donna"" (esattamente come quando qualcuno attacca &lt;esponente politico di sesso femminile&gt; perche' gli stan sulle balle i politici e il suddetto esponente politico dice ""mi hanno attaccato in quanto donna! invoco la morte per decapitazione perche' sono stata offesa nel mio intimo in quanto donna""), mentre e' ""semplicemente"" (infelice scelta di parole) un omicidio.
Se uccido una non necessariamente la ho uccisa ""perche' donna"" o ""perche' non mela ha data"", potrei anche semplicemente essere un pazzo assassino che ha tirato una moneta e ha detto ""tu oggi muori"". Ovviamente sui giornali si titolera' del fenomeno del femminicidio, la cui causa sicuramente e' da ricercare nel fatto che &lt;intervista al sociologo&gt;

&gt;A parte i pugliesi che l'hanno sentito nel TG locale, qualcuno ha sentito parlare della donna in provincia di Brindisi che ha dato fuoco al marito qualche mese fa?

Nope, mi risulta nuova la notizia. Lieto di sapere che ogni tanto c'e' un omicidio in rosa! \o/

&gt;Senza contare che nelle statistiche non rientrano i casi in cui la moglie fa uccidere il marito dall'amante. Questi omicidi, essendo compiuti tecnicamente da un uomo, sono calcolati nelle statistiche di omicidi fra i generi, o questa omissione fa pendere la bilancia in favore dei sostenitori dell'esistenza di questa emergenza?

La cosa divertente e' anche vedere come in quei casi quasi nessuno si pone la questione ""ha commissionato un omicidio"".

Anyway, we're not discussing what liberalisation should and shouldn't mean, but what it actually is. You're right, Europe is a risk averse place, but that's not that much of a bad thing when we take into account that sometimes the reason some of those regulations are there is to protect people's quality of life (when not their actual lives, and let's go back to engineers now being able to give their ok to building projects without having to consult an architect).

&gt;Find me somewhere where it says that peoples of the EU are ordained to have a better life than other people. Or that the EU is entitled to benefits that others can only dream of. Please do so as I'd be incredibly grateful. 

Well, for one it's incredibly refreshing to see a liberal saying things so clearly, I thank you for that, I really do. Do you realise that you can't suggest that more liberalisation of labour would be beneficial for Europe and, in the same comment, say that european citizens shouldn't ask for a better life than those currently working in sweatshops across Asia? And somehow you may even find surprising that some of us expect our politicians to protect us from corporations willing to turn your vision into a reality.

I mean no disrespect to you guys, I really don't, but I can't help but think of neoliberalism as some sort of ""new communism"". Everything is pretty damn great when you're reading about it, it even has some very cool ideas, but the moment someone tries to implement it things go crazy fast.

Even worse for Leopold, Britain and Prussia would almost certainly have intervened. Britain had a strict policy of preventing the domination of the Continental coast of the Channel by any single power (which is indeed why it entered WWI...to defend Belgium). An overly powerful, expansionist Belgium would have been a serious concern in London. And Bismarck would have seized the opportunity to expand Prussia's own power towards the Channel, with the support of Protestant public opinion in core Prussia.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Anyway, we're not discussing what liberalisation should and shouldn't mean, but what it actually is. You're right, Europe is a risk averse place, but that's not that much of a bad thing when we take into account that sometimes the reason some of those regulations are there is to protect people's quality of life (when not their actual lives, and let's go back to engineers now being able to give their ok to building projects without having to consult an architect).

Ok, to play this point a little more - why *can't* an engineer give an ok to a simple house conforming to a standard design? I agree it is different if you're building a nuclear power station or a bridge or something. But a simple house? 

Not to say there should not be some regulations because it is clear there should be, but why have such a narrow scope as to say ""only architects can ok building projects"" why not allow others to do more standard and basic construction projects?

&gt; Do you realise that you can't suggest that more liberalisation of labour would be beneficial for Europe and, in the same comment, say that european citizens shouldn't ask for a better life than those currently working in sweatshops across Asia? And somehow you may even find surprising that some of us expect our politicians to protect us from corporations willing to turn your vision into a reality.

I think you missed the point somewhat - or at least my point. Europeans should ak for a better quality of life, but then so should ***every human on the planet***. What I mean is that there is no universal law, no ""God""-given right to have what we have. We must earn it in some form or other.

For every euro or pound or dollar or resource that we spend supporting the ill, the unemployed, or something that resource must come from somewhere.

Now, we could revert to military interventionalism and empire building but I think history has shown that such things are costly and give rise to a very unstable world which is not pleasent to live in. 

Or we can try something else - which we call [Globalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization). Clearly this is a big subject and I can't argue the whole thing here but as a basic principle globalisation allows for greater exploitation of the [division of labour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour).

Take an example - if the UK only allows steel to be made in the UK to be used in the UK and allows no imports then you have a very small market, unit costs (and typically overall costs) will be much higher than a company which is able to trade globally. The past few decades is full of examples of this (British Steel now Tata none the less). 

[Protectionism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism) which is what the French seem to constantly favour on the grounds of ""social good"" is really not a great strategy and has been demonstratably a failure throughout history. 

The point being that if we wish to maintain our social benefits then we must compete on a global stage because we also benefit a lot from globalisation. 

The ""problem"" with corporations lobbying governments is a question of legislation and better regulation not wholescale abandonment of free market capitalism. We need to evolve regulation as we learn from our mistakes not blanket ban things because they are difficult. 

As I said in the previous post we need to invest more in our people through education and training because yes, to be unskilled in a world which is increasingly needing skilled people is an invitation to poverty. No amount of taxation on billionaires or companies is going to stop that. It will simply move industry to more receptive countries that want the economic growth. 

Feel free to provide an alternative narrative and tell me what the world should look like from your point of view but the European ""vision"" of navel gazing and introspection coupled with a French desire for protectionism is going to damn the EU to become the Africa of tomorrow.

Answer the question, though. What's your argument for claiming that interest in other cultures is unnatural?

Remember that I'm coming from the standpoint that there *is* no useful distinction between cultural and natural — both acts of violence and kindness require more complex explanations than simply ""it's natural"" or ""it's cultural"" — but since you cling to the distinction, I expect you to justify that.

* You have to filter tap water if you want to drink it.
* Most homes I visited were **hot**. During the winter I usually wear three layers of clothes, but in Russia I usually only had a T-shirt and sometimes I opened the window because it was too hot inside (but outside it was less than -10°C).
* The toilet paper is crap.
* In France I jaywalk all the time. In Russia you don't do this because it's dangerous for your life.
* Russians drink tea all the time, but they don't drink a lot of water. I almost shocked my friend's parents when I drank water after a cup of tea.
* Nobody cares about seat belts. Once I sat in the back of a taxi and I tried to fasten my seat belt (I do this automatically without even thinking about it) until I realized the belt simply didn't exist.
* [Marshrutki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshrutka) (shared taxis) are probably the thing that surprised me the most. Passengers give the money to other passengers who pass it on to the driver, which is something I have never seen in France. And marshrutka drivers handle money while driving and speaking on the phone (without a seat belt, obviously).
* The metro stations are much better than in Paris. Bigger, more beautiful and cleaner.
* Most Russians (at least the ones I visited) don't have a microwave. I couchsurfed with my Russian friend in Saint Petersburg and the hosts had the only microwave I saw in Russia. My friend didn't know how to use it and she ended up microwaving pasta for five minutes.
* [Banya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banya_%28sauna%29). I found it… weird.

true,Ipsey,UNSA,United States of America,"The best thing is we're out of the[ food deserts.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert)  When I wasn't driving in the states I would pick places to live near grocery stores so I could walk, otherwise I would have to rely on people to give me rides to the store, or schedule grocery visits around my parents. I talked my mom into getting a Sams Club membership with me so she would drive us, but I would pay for the yearly membership. She kept it after I moved here, so I guess she liked the benefit of bulk buying. 

I miss that, mostly - there's some things I feel we have to have as staples, so we buy those as often as we can at the big big grocery store here in Denmark (20 cans of Tomato sauce? 20kg of rice? Ginormous bags of frozen vegetables? Yes please!) Because they never go bad and we eat them regularly enough that it's worth the cost of storing them. 

Other things, day to day stuff, I appreciate the corner grocery store for. I like being able to go to my store if I'm out of milk or if I need peppers for dinner or if I get a wild idea to have my husband make frikadeller for dinner but we don't have the meat for it (he's best at Danish food and shut up those things are delicious). 

The best thing though is the specialty markets - the cheese shops and the bakeries and the fish markets and the green grocers and the little ethnic markets. We ~~absolutely do not have those~~ *these things can be difficult to find* in the States and they are gorgeous. I love walking down town in my city and being able to do an around the world tour without leaving the city and without breaking the bank - a big bag of fresh strawberries from the green market on wednesday, some good Danish Havarti from the cheesemarket, a nice side of smoked salmon from the fish market, plus a nice fresh baked rugbrød and a french bread from the baker, then down to the spanish store for a fuet, the turkish market for some dates and figs, across to the asian market for some cherry juice for me and some mango juice for my husband, then it's on the bus and home; and all in the time to be back by lunch. 

I mean, and that's just here in the tiny town I live in Denmark. Go to somewhere bigger like Copenhagen, Oslo, Berlin, Amsterdam, Brussels, London, Barcelona - I mean your options are greater and your possibilities are endless.

At the core of this issue lies the fact that the main objective of an enterprise are benefits, it cares about the interests of its shareholders and obviously not about those of the general population or even those of its workers. There has to be laws and regulations to protect us (and by us I mean the little people) from the predations of the capital. What we're seeing in South Europe right now is how some of those laws are suddenly ignored or derogued and how many of our basic service infrastructures (health care comes to mind) are being dismantled and privatised to the benefit of a very real oligarchy.

&gt;I think you missed the point somewhat - or at least my point. Europeans should ak for a better quality of life, but then so should every human on the planet. What I mean is that there is no universal law, no ""God""-given right to have what we have. We must earn it in some form or other.

But I'm afraid you're being disingenous now.

It depends what they have to do. If their job is just to hand over medicines across the counter then alright. If they're also supposed to mix prescibed recipes, ensure the quality of their products and advise people about combining medicines or alternative products, then some quality control is sensible.

&gt;America for all its faults has a better approach than Europe in my opinion - they allow things to fail rather than legislate to death in the first place. Europe is a very risk averse place.

I disagree, that varies a lot. For example founding and choosing schools in Belgium is effectively free market - grant money follows the sutdents. While in the USA people are typically assigned to a school based on where they live.

&gt;Find me somewhere where it says that peoples of the EU are ordained to have a better life than other people. Or that the EU is entitled to benefits that others can only dream of. Please do so as I'd be incredibly grateful.

This has little to do with divine right, but rather how low are you willing to stoop in service of global capital?

&gt;Or perhaps we need to realise that we (Westerners) are in a very fortunate circumstance because of our history and, in a few too many cases, because of the questionable moral legacy we inherited from Emprires and exploitation of others.

Go guilt someone else into paying.

&gt;We need to compete with those countries you so condescendingly dismiss because oddly enough they would like to have the quality of life that we enjoy. And why shouldn't they?

How are they going to obtain quality of life by sacrificing any social standards for the fleeting favors of global capital?

&gt;education being the most obvious and stop pissing money away on idiotic things like CAP.

Obvious education, that we have to cut for the favors of global capital. The CAP is a matter of security. We simply can't afford to let our food depend on the whims of the global market.

&gt;What's the point of competing with China (1 billion people) on labour cost?

You contradict yourself. You say we absolutely need to let go our privileges and then turn around and say there's no point competing on labor cost. What shall it be?

&gt;Protectionism will go so far, in that the environment and other concerns are valid and should be taken in to account. But protectionism to protect workers from competition will only hurt the EU in the longer term.

So goes the gospel. What exactly is the benefit of a general wage cut of, say 25% again?

Punto per punto:

&gt; apre lontano dalle case (nella rinomata campagna milanese?)

Non necessariamente nella ""rinomata campagna"", basta spostarsi in qualche locale sfitto (ce ne sono tanti a prezzi modici!!) nelle parti antiche della periferia estrema milanese (per intenderci...bruzzano, greco, niguarda, baggio, chiaravalle), che aspettano solo di essere adeguatamente valorizzate.

&gt;zone a scarsa concentrazione di bar/ristoranti (che è un danno, quante volte ci siamo detti ""andiamo sul naviglio e qualcosa troviamo""? se la movida si sparpaglia, è peggio per tutti IMHO anche perchè si deve spostare in zone meno servite)

Dubito che la movida si sparpagli. Di sicuro i locali tipo [questo](http://www.letrottoir.it/), noti per essere condotti da soggetti senza particolari scrupoli, faranno una brutta fine. 

&gt; garantiranno la dotazione di parcheggi nei dintorni (che va a danno di tutti i locali in zone pedonali e poi non so come i locali esistenti potrebbero garantirli)

Io ho sempre avuto difficoltà a trovare parcheggio nelle zone della movida. Alla fine, per andare a bere 1 birra sui navigli durante il weekend dovevo parcheggiare in via sarfatti, come minimo. 

&gt;apre lontano da ""elementi di pregio artistico"" (con buona pace dei locali in colonne, arco della pace, porta romana, ...)

Ma con gioia e sollievo degli estimatori dei suddetti elementi di pregio artistico, già scarsi e ridotti ai minimi termini in una città in costante evoluzione come Milano.

&gt; penalizza chi ha un dehor (ma tanto è dicembre, chissenefrega!)

i dehor si usano anche d'estate, per ""delimitare il territorio""

&gt;chiusure entro le 23 nei giorni feriali !!!!??! ma se devo tornare a casa alle 23 quasi non vale la pena di uscire!!

questo è forse l'unico punto debole del provvedimento. Io avrei limitato la chiusura anticipata nei giorni dal lunedì al giovedì, in cui effettivamente, circola meno gente di sera. 


&gt; mette le navette (ma quanti sono i locali che si possono permettere delle navette?? o che le hanno mai messe? forse il magnolia?)

Non è necessario che mettano a disposizione delle navette proprie. Basta ""convenzionarsi"" con il gestore  (indovinate chi è l'azionista di maggioranza?) del servizio [Radiobus](http://www.atm-mi.it/it/ViaggiaConNoi/Radiobus/Pagine/Radiobus.aspx).

&gt; apre lontano da scuole e ospedali (mi pare abbastanza inutile anche perchè non vedo come i locali si sovrappongano agli orari delle scuole, ne mi sovvengono locali vicino agli ospedali, ma vabbe)

A volte dopo certe serate movimentate nella zona della movida rimangono dei bellissimi ricordini sul pavimento senza che i locali gestiti dai soggetti con pochi scrupoli di cui sopra si degnino di mettere mano alla ramazza o di convenzionarsi con l'AMSA per le pulizie supplementari. Quindi, tanto vale mettere le mani avanti e crearsi il pretesto per colpire duro.

&gt; insonorizza, climatizza, aumenta la capienza, mette impianti per fumatori, serrande elettriche (e vabbè forse è l'unico punto che può andare anche a favore di chi nei locali ci va)

Condivido. E aggiungerei anche qualcosina in più in tema di igiene...certi ristoranti pseudo-fusion sono bombe biologiche in attesa di esplodere...o potenziali focolai di H7N9...

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Ok, to play this point a little more - why can't an engineer give an ok to a simple house conforming to a standard design? I agree it is different if you're building a nuclear power station or a bridge or something. But a simple house?

Because even a ""simple"" house nowadays requires a bewildering knowledge of products, standards and markets. You can't expect someone without training to get that sufficiently right to let him go along with trial and error.

And besides, it's mostly companies who insist on exactly the right experience before even considering you for a job. And without jobs, you can't get experience. So there's a lot more to it than a blindly overregulating government.

&gt;I think you missed the point somewhat - or at least my point. Europeans should ak for a better quality of life, but then so should every human on the planet.

And trashing quality, wage and safety standards contributes to that how exactly?

&gt;Or we can try something else - which we call Globalization. Clearly this is a big subject and I can't argue the whole thing here but as a basic principle globalisation allows for greater exploitation of the division of labour.

Assuming transport costs remain low. Scrap that, transport costs have never been low - we've just not been taking the long-term environmental cost into account. So we get a strawberry farm delivering strawberries grown near city a to city b, and a strawberry farm near city delivering strawberries to city a. In other words, a waste of time, energy and ecological integrity in order to save a few bucks.

&gt;For every euro or pound or dollar or resource that we spend supporting the ill, the unemployed, or something that resource must come from somewhere.

That's a common fallacy: government services are not consumption per se. Education, for example, is a valuable good. The only reason we levy taxes is because it's more practical to let people make their contribution to society in money instead of conscripting labor. In fact, the monetization of the economy was stimulated for an important part because government required taxes to be paid in money. When left free, the people generally preferred to stick to their local economy.

&gt;Protectionism which is what the French seem to constantly favour on the grounds of ""social good"" is really not a great strategy and has been demonstratably a failure throughout history. 

On the contrary, early British industry never would have come off the ground without early protective tariffs (and military destroying the Indian textile production when necessary). Just like China is doing now... Calling for more liberalisation more and more resembles medieval surgeons calling for more bloodletting.

&gt;Feel free to provide an alternative narrative and tell me what the world should look like from your point of view but the European ""vision"" of navel gazing and introspection coupled with a French desire for protectionism is going to damn the EU to become the Africa of tomorrow.

The European citizens are completely in their right to attach tariffs to any product that doesn't reach their (social, quality, environmental,...) standards, IMO. This should, of course, be product-based, not country-based. Then the companies can choose for themselves whether they think it's worth the trouble to produce that way.

C'est une préférence sexuelles que certains trouvent choquante. 

Tout comme l'homosexualité, c'est une pratique qui existe de toute éternité et qui n'embête personne tant qu'elle est pratiquée entre adultes consentants.

&gt; l'inceste n'est qu'entre famille proche (parents/enfants)

Petite précision. Jusqu'à très récemment, l'inceste ne faisait pas partie du code civil il me semble. Seule l'interdiction d'épouser ses parents et ses frères et soeurs (qui vaut d'ailleurs il me semble également pour les enfants adoptés). Avoir des relations sexuelles, même dans ce cas là, est tout à fait légal entre adultes consentants. Ce n'est qu'en cas de viol que ça constitue un facteur aggravant.

À noter qu'il s'agit de la définition légale du droit français. La notion d'inceste en dehors du cadre légal est plus large et les relations entre cousins sont très souvent considérées comme incestueuses. Aux Etats-Unis par exemple, Mme Boutin n'aurait pu épouser son cousin dans de nombreux états.

Veramente prima era tutto rose e fiori e poi, passato il confine del *passaggio di proprietà*, iniziano le legnate?

Forse veramente si pensa che il matrimonio, che altro non è che un contratto, sia percepito come un passaggio di proprietà di un bene da un uomo all'altro. Nonostante sia il 2013 e non il 1013.

Nurses do a lot of tasks that were previously in the realm of doctors. In so far as possible I have no objection to training nurses to perform tasks which allow doctors to perform harder operations. 

&gt; What we're seeing in South Europe right now is how some of those laws are suddenly ignored or derogued and how many of our basic service infrastructures (health care comes to mind) are being dismantled and privatised to the benefit of a very real oligarchy.

What you are seeing in Southern Europe is what has been there for far too long.  Systemic corruption. That is not the fault of capitalism/liberalism any more than it'd be the fault of communism or socialism. Corruption can exist in any system.

&gt; But I'm afraid you're being disingenous now. You know pretty damn well that when you talk about ""competing on a global stage"" you mean competing against the likes of China or Bangladesh (which I'm sure they are beautiful countries),

Yes and no - Europe should not be competing with China of low wage jobs but seeking to improve its share of the knowledge and service economies - see [comparative advantage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage).

It's not about competing in a race to the bottom but investing to have a race to the top. It is no good whatsoever trying to save jobs in industries whose main component relies on cheap labour. 

&gt; something which involves setting our current labour laws decades back and developing an underpaid working class with barely no rights who'll spend all their lives living in poverty.

No, I'm suggesting we spend more on education so we don't get in to this position, but if we maintain the status quo and insist on aimless protectionism a la French model of economics we will end up exactly where you describe.

Maintenant que tu y es je vais t'expliquer le point de vue de Mme Boutin et une partie des citoyens français. 
Ils ont des valeurs familiales, très lié à leur religion et leur milieu. Cela depuis leur enfance permettent de juger leurs actions; dans leur livre arbitre, l'homosexualité est un crime atroce. Si tu es gay tu finis en enfer après ta mort. L'inceste est également condamné comme l'homosexualité.
La Loi française a condamné l'inceste et ne laissant au homos que le pacs, une union civile qui ne possède pas tous les droits d'un mariage, réprime l'homosexualité dans la société. Les homos sont des demi-citoyens et n'ont pas les droits des hétéros c'est pourquoi les personnes comme Mme Boutin étaient finalement content de l'arrangement qui suivait presque leurs idéologies. 
Le mariage pour tous les dérangent. Pour protéger leurs familles et leurs idées ils ont donc essayé (et essayent toujours) de faire abroger la loi donnant l'accès à un mariage civil et donc les droits perdus du pacs au couple homos.

On passe au point de vue du monsieur homosexuel de la vidéo: en attaquant sa nature et son identité même (je ne veux pas ouvrir un débat sur le fait d’acquérir son identité sexuelle lors de l'adolescence ou à la naissance mais le constat actuel des psychologues français est que l'homosexualité est présent dès la petite enfance) Mme Boutin essaye de coller son idéologie sur un homme qui ne partage aucune des valeurs familiales cet homme cherche donc un moyen de faire comprendre à Christine Boutin qu'il n'y a aucune raison de cette violence envers autrui même si il est différent. 
Je ne sais pas son point de vue mais maintenant je vais exprimer le miens et c'est surement le siens également. Les cousins vont partis du cadre de la famille proche: on joue enfant avec les filles/fils de nos tantes/oncles. Donc le rapport presque incestueux n'est pas possible avec eux et même si la génétique dicte que c'est possible.

Dall'altro le ragazze cresciute con mamma che ""serve"" il babbo, a pulire la stanza del fratello.

Ora, il ragazzo di cui sopra, mettiamo si ritrovi disoccupato e che abbia una serie di grattacapi. Niente nella sua educazione gli ha insegnato come gestire fallimento, frustrazione, rabbia. Cos'ha in mano?
Ha solo una ragazza, la sua ragazza. Allora inizia quello che bonariamente le nonne chiamavano ""tiranneggiare"". Prima ti abbraccio e ti coccolo, poi mi arrabbio se leggi un messaggino che ti arriva perché non mi dai attenzione:e che cazzo, pure tu mi metti da parte?Poi la strattoni perché perdi la pazienza perché vuole uscire con un'amica, ma lo vuole capire che poi tu stai in ansia, e chissá cosa succede?etc etc etc...

Lui  volte é triste, a volte é frustrato, ma non sa come esprimere questi sentimenti, perché suvvia, babbo e zio dicono che manco li deve avere uno i sentimenti, sinnó fimmina é!E cosí continua la sua vita di piccole esplosioni e non-comprensioni di sé...

Lei dall'altro lato é confusa. Mi abbraccia, mi coccola, allora mi vuol bene. A volte mi spinge e si arrabbia, ma sará come mio fratello che perde la pazienza. I ""maschi"" son fatti cosí. Poi insomma, io gli ho risposto a tono, l'ho fatto arrabbiare...etc etc.

Temo che questi scenari diano una buona idea di come molte persone comuni, in un ambiente dove i ruoli di genere non danno la possibilitá di capire ed esprimere le proprie emozioni in maniera libera o di avere rispetto per sé e per gli altri, possano portare in alcun i casi ai fenomeni che stiamo osservando.

Non che siamo migliori degli altri, ma con un certo GDP e reddito pro-capite, il fenomeno non dovrebbe essere a quei numeri lí.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"If you give somebody barely enough money to survive on, and they spend it on drugs instead of on food, then yes, that's a poor choice. But most of them don't, and those who do aren't employable and need help in the form of mental health treatment and drug rehabilitation. So, we've established that we both agree that there should be more of that, along with training and other assistance programs.

The effect that purely non-monetary aid would have on the majority of people on welfare, that is those who have fallen on hard times due to reasons unrelated to addiction or mental health, is that you exclude them from normal life, which in turn will affect their up to then still normal mental health. Your friends might even be fine with paying for the occasional beer or inviting you to see a movie or whatever, but simply being able to pay for a six pack that you can bring to hang out with friends in the park instead of relying on their charity yet again makes a huge difference. In today's world, not having cash inevitably leads to social exclusion, and social exclusion makes people ill and eventually unemployable.

You want people to work, but don't trust them with the money to pay for their own food. I would not trust anybody who's not capable of taking basic responsibility for their life to take the responsibility that comes with even the most mundane job I'd consider hiring them for. The fraction of welfare recipients that aren't capable of that are health care cases, not simply unemployed. Again, yes, there should be many more and better programs to help them, just as there should be better training and job assistance programs for the rest, but institutionalizing the responsibility to care for every aspect of their lives to prevent a few drug addicts from spending their welfare check on their addiction won't help anybody -- and ultimately, it won't save any of your tax dollars.",0,1369834270,null,0,false,0,ca83o7r,t3_1f89kl,t1_ca83o7r,t1_ca801fw,null,1430996743,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

No, but your option is clinging on to an outdated version that was *never* competitive, but you could hide that fact in the free for all version that was the former EZ. That is not really an option is it - you have needed to reform since the 90's at least, well since before the Euro and not doing it isn't really doing you any favours. But, if you want to cling to bureacracy and refuse reforms that should have been done ages ago - feel free. But, then again, why should anyone, in particular countries who did these reforms when they were called for, feel sorry for Spain? I mean, one is not asking Spain to kick everyone to the curb, just do stuff that should had been done decades ago (that people are being kicked out, blame that on banks, not on anything else).

I remember being at the long-distance bus station in Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, which is by no means a minor or underdeveloped city, it had a pretty good road and public transportation system and one of the biggest airports in SE Asia. 

So, in that toilet - just as in a very, very big part of public toilets around China - cabins had no doors, and walls were about knee-high. So when you squat, taking a dump, (nearly all toilets are squatting, too, hardly any toilet seats), everyone standing can see your... everything. Furthermore, the place is pretty crowded, and when you're the only white foreigner around, really stand out, and everyone is staring at you. 

So there I was, squatting, pants off, urgently needing to get things done cause my bus was leaving in 5 minutes... And a crowd of Chinese onlookers curiously studying me, without even showing any sign of feeling inconvenient about it.

In 1906 Britain signed over control of Papua to the newly united country of Australia. In 1914 Australia invaded German New Guinea and from 1919  it administered both as territories (the Territory of New Guinea and the Territory of Papua) under a league of nations mandate.

In 1941 Japan invaded the island of New Guinea as well as much of SE Asia. At its closest, Papua is about 150km from the Australian mainland and there was a lot of fear that this would be used as a base to invade the mainland. 

After the war the eastern half of the island was administered as the UN trust [Terrirory of Papua and New Guinea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_Papua_and_New_Guinea).

In turn the House of Lancaster had matrilineal links to the House of Dinefwr in Wales. So Henry Tudor was a direct descendant of Emperor Constantine (admittedly female line of a female line). He probably had more legitimacy than the York house anyway.

And Prussia also had rather different plans by then.

But such hopes would almost certainly been dashed, for Bismarck was one of the European statesmen who most clearly saw Leopold for the shameless, cheating lying ruffian that he was.

true,lurkmoarno,null,null,"Ich lurke hier eigentlich nur aus Freude an solchen Diskussionen, aber hier würd ich gerne etwas dazu sagen. 

Zuerst, es ist mir relativ egal wer von euch beiden recht hat, an den Realitäten ändert das sowieso nichts.

Was mir aber auffällt: Demigod bleibt bei seinen Aussagen und zieht im Gegensatz zu dir keine Vergleiche. Das macht deine Argumentation zumindest angreifbar, denn nur weil bspw. die katholische Kirche oder das Judentum etwas negatives tut, ist dies noch kein Persilschein für andere Religionen.

Weiterhin seh ich den Vorwurf von Verbindungen zu PI oder der Rechten als ein Scheinargument. Es ist durchaus legitim dieser politischen Weltanschauung anzugehören, warum auch nicht? Dadurch wird das, was diese Leute von sich geben nicht wahr, aber eben auch nicht falsch.

Ich glaube vielmehr stark, dass Demigod hier provozieren will und ich glaube auch, dass er, dem Stil deiner Postings nach zu urteilen, erfolgreich damit ist. 

Das gesamte Argument ist eigentlich Teil einer Debatte, die man wesentlich früher sachlich hätte führen müssen, dies war gesellschaftlich in Deutschland aber nie möglich. Daher der Strategiewechsel der politischen Rechten hin zu einer polemischen, vor allem Emotionen erregenden Debatte, weil man die Menschen dadurch besser erreicht. 

Michael Stürzenberger treibt dies auf seinen Kundgebungen bis zur Perfektion, er erzwingt schon fast die Antworten die er hören will, wenn er sich mit seinen Kritikern auseinandersetzt. Diese gehen ihm sehr oft auf den Leim, weil auch sie versuchen vieles in Relation zu setzen, zu beschwichtigen und Vergleiche zu ziehen, anstatt sich der Diskussion um dieses Thema offensiv zu stellen. 

Wenn also jemand durch einen Anhänger des muslimischen Glaubens getötet wurde, ist es nicht ratsam zu argumentieren, dass Christen dies auch tun. Viel richtiger wäre es, dieses Verbrechen auf Schärfste zu verurteilen und Strafen basierend auf unserer Gesetzgebung zu fordern, anstatt den Populisten weiter Munition zu liefern.

Den Fehler machst du hier auch. Demigod entzieht sich deinen Angriffen komplett indem er den Islam als Ganzes angreift, während du ihm unterstellst er hetze gegen Menschen oder Volksgruppen und auch dahingehend argumentierst. 

Dies mag sein eigentliches Ziel sein, dazu bekennen tut er sich aber nicht. Es ihm zu unterstellen ist die eine Sache, zu belgegen das dies so ist die andere. Ich hab zumindest hier(seine Postinghistorie bin ich jetzt nicht durchgegangen) nichts gefunden worauf man ihn festnageln könnte.

Es ist nämlich unheimlich schwer solcher Kritik sachlich zu begegnen, auf welchem Niveau sie auch immer stattfindet, und ihr zu widersprechen, denn es lassen sich hunderte Beispiele für eine Bestätigung dieser finden und diese einzeln zu widerlegen ist schlicht unmöglich. 

Was wäre also so falsch daran zuzustimmen, dass es sich um abscheuliche Verbrechen handelt die geschehen? Nimmt man damit nicht viel Wind aus den Segeln der Kritiker? Vieles liegt eben im Argen, nur die Schlussfolgerungen die daraus gezogen werden mögen falsch sein.

Darüber sollte man sprechen und nicht ob das Verbrechen X durch einen Moslem begangen wurde und dies ja nicht so schlimm sei, weil das Christentum auch Mörder kennt. 

Sprecht also darüber, ob sich eine Verantwortung des Islams überhaupt konstruieren lässt oder wie man dieser Fehlannahme entgeht.

I have had little good to say about the former state premier of Baden-Württemberg in this thread right now.

“It worries me that too many politicians still believe that everything will be fine,” I say, according to this thread. “Parties are ripe for overhaul.”

I would argue that the 59-year-old member of Angela Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) has ceased to function politically: “It worries me that some politicians are essentially unsupportable: like Oettinger”

And I also say that Oettinger was “completely unprepared to do what’s necessary” to get his english skills to an acceptable level.

I also don't spare Merkel – who didn't sent Oettinger to learn proper english – either.

Oettinger, I say, is jeopardizing his success with the wrong skillset.

&gt; She's been told to forget about her degree

True, as I said before, as long as you look at the degree as a way to get a job. False, of course, since these studies have made her grow as a human being and could also be directly useful in a future job, just not as a way to get it.

FTR, my wife has a similar degree and works as a police sergeant. She says that she applies the psychology she learned at university everyday in the streets...

&gt; [hard time moving from Loiret]

Even if she's living in the countryside, Orléans is a very big city and has a lot of infrastructures. After retraining, she could find a job there.

&gt; getting unstuck fron her job

This will require training. There are a lot of opportunities for adult education in France, either directly, through professional schools or GRETA, or indirectly through VAE or DIF.

I assume that there is no opportunity to go up to management in her current job (That would be the first thing to explore, since she already has a university degree and the job)

What you can do to help is to spend some time with her exploring the different fields in which she would be interested in working, and focusing on the few where she has an actual chance of getting a job. 

You mention cooking; I wouldn't go there, it's a crowded field for people without degrees, and a degree selective enough to guarantee employment will require many years of study.

One thing that stands out is nursing (especially since your younger sister is a nurse). The psychology degree will probably be good enough to get her direct access to second year or maybe third year in a French nursing program. Since your sister is Portuguese and thus a EU citizen, the French nursing program will be state-funded and quasi-free to her.

Nurisng school can also be done on part-time, or full-time on employer's scholarship, or remotely. I positively guarantee that, with two big hospitals, there are several nursing schools in Orléans.

Nurses are in such high demand that they can work anywhere they want. There are well-travelled paths into management and upper management, and also significant side-channels towards other medical professions.

&gt; we still have a biiiig medical expenses debt to pay

Since Portugal has socialized medicine like the rest of the civilized countries in Europe, I'm really curious on how you could incur that big a debt for the illness of your aunt.

All the packaging is simple with lots of blues and whites, all the packages remind me of ""Ja!"" brand.  I find myself having to look harder at figuring out what is actually in the package, box, can, etc.  The branding seemed much more...regulated.  Just my 2 cents.  

However, the meat/ bread sections were bomb as hell (that means good).  And to be honest, it gave me a little more hope for US supermarkets.  I came home and was able to think, ""this isn't *so* different that Germany's meat section.""  And to me, if i find any similarity between an european supermarket and a US supermarket, i'm happy.   

Also, the milk.  I know, milk can stay out of a fridge before it's opened, we have that in our US stores.  But to me, it irks me to see milk outside of a fridge, despite understanding it isn't going to go bad.  For me, milk goes from cow to fridge as fast as possible.  I don't care if it's homogenous, pasteurized, whatever.  Its preference, and ive been raised that way. 

Overall, German and US supermarkets are fairly similar in terms of layout and organization.  They tend to be a little smaller, and the idea of depositing a euro for a shopping cart is a bit taboo for me, but i dig it.

I think he means that resource scarcity is what makes the ""free market"" work. If something isn't scarce or limited in availability, it's not profitable.

Like for example selling sand in the Sahara desert, or seawater in the Atlantic, or selling air. Those commodities are just so abundant and available that there is no way to sell them and make a profit.

That's one severe limitation the ""free market"" imposes on technological advancement. Corporations won't invent technologies that would create such abundance, even if they could easily do it.

Like cancer medicine for example, prices for that are kept artificially high through intellectual property rights, which has no relation to production costs. This is costing millions of lives. But it's highly profitable due to cancer becoming much more common.

The health industry is a prime example of this. There's no real reason to cure any illness, as long as you can just treat the symptoms and have people remain sick but alive.

true,Ipsey,UNSA,United States of America,"Not really. I did the [slow carb diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-Carb_Diet) for a while and it wasn't that difficult. 

So like I said in my above post, we bulk buy, and that includes our meats. We buy chicken breasts in something like a 5 kilo box (I think, maybe I'm off on the weight - I just checked and it has 2 bags of 2750 grams of frozen chicken); then we buy cans of tomatoes in 20 cans per case, and we bulk buy beans (That's my lentils you're sniffing /r/frugal ) and frozen vegetables in huge bags (2000 grams of vegetables). It's not amazing variety but it works and it keeps you fed; but we come out on top with the spices, and with enough combinations of meat + veg + bean you come out okay. 

We had a couple of recipes that we still have in our regular rotation from that time period (I'm currently extremely sick and don't have the energy to maintain that sort of diet, so that's why we're off it).

Some of the ones we still eat (sorry for the abbreviated recipe, this is off the top of my head and with my shit memory from being sick): 

**Tomato, Bacon, and Bean Soup:**

1) Cut up fresh tomatoes, roast under bacon and with spices and olive oil. Once roasted, separate out tomatoes and bacon. Reserve bacon for topping. 

2) Use canned (or leftover cooked beans - this is probably better) and blend roasted tomatoes and a can of cooked tomatoes together with the beans.  Blend until smooth. 

3) Pour blended mixture into stock (or water with boullion cubes) and heat. 

4) When heated and spiced to taste, top with bacon and serve. 

*(If your diet does not allow beans, leave them out. This tomato soup is delicious with bacon. Also bacon is delicious with tomato soup. Also bacon is delicious.)* 

**Tuna Salad**

What? Tuna Salad? But that requires bread! Lettuce wraps, bitches. 

Put whatever dressing you require in your tuna salad, as per your diet's requirements. I like a little whole grain mustard, lemon, and oil, but I like things on the sharp side. My husband likes remoulade, because he's a Dane and Danes put that on everything (sometimes I like it on my tuna salad but don't tell [him](/u/TheDanishDude) because he hoards his like some crazy viking guy. 

You need 

Tuna

Frozen Peas

Onion

Red Beans

Spices

Dressing

Dice onion, Drain and wash beans, rinse in warm water to unfreeze them, drain tuna and give the tuna water to your cat cause she's going ""*neer, neer, lady, neer, you opened something in a can so it must be mine! neer, neer!*"" add in your spices and dressing, and mix that all up together so that it makes something to your tastes. I dunno. Tuna is a highly subjective thing. 

**Lazy Lentil Soup** 

People will hate me for doing this, but this is what I make when I'm feeling uncreative and I'm tired. 

I brown a package of ground beef, then I throw a boullion on top of it and pour a bag of lentils on it. Then when the lentils seem soft, I throw a bag of broccoli mix on it. Then I spice it to taste. Then I eat that for two days. 

I wish I had lentils right now, because I feel really tired and uncreative but I'm out cause I've had a lot of those days recently. 

But you can still do that with no lentils. I dunno how keto and paleo feel about lentils (I know how frugal feels about lentils cause they won't stop talking about it, amirite? But seriously, it's kind of an eh food for me). 

Beyond that, pork is super cheap here and they practically throw it at you. (Salmon is cheaper in Norway, where they were packing it in our suitcases as we were leaving. ""*Oh you're going? No, I don't know where the reindeer sausage and side of salmon came from...*"") I dunno how paleo/keto feels about certain meats, but some things are easier to find than others. Meat tends to be seasonal too, some things you can get cheaper than others. Duck comes out during the winter, turkey around Thanksgiving (and by god we had some gorgeous Turkey breasts at Thanksgiving, which is apparently when the Americans came over and brought Advertising to Denmark), venison and lamb around spring(?), and ymmv on other things. 

Another thing is to try shopping different places for different things. I used to live across from a butcher (They closed it down ): ) so we used to get crazy good deals on sausage and they'd have barbecues in the summer. Fresh fish is cheaper by the harbor than at the places in town. The chicken farmer might give you a cheaper deal than the grocery store. Shop around, maybe? I don't like to settle for what's in front of me and I'm big on hunting to find what I like (lol, paleo right?) so if I want something, I go out and find it. 

I hope you find what you're looking for :D

&gt;On accepte, inconsciemment, davantage d'un petit garçon qu'il soit turbulent, c'est une manière de l'encourager, de lui faire savoir que c'est le rôle qu'il doit prendre.

Les garçons sont plus turbulents également à cause de facteurs biologiques (*la testostérone est un stéroïde naturel plus présent chez les garçons et les hommes*). Ils parlent plus tard et sont propres plus tard. L'autisme est une maladie principalement masculine (3 fois plus d'hommes), et beaucoup d'hommes ont des formes mineures d'autisme, non pathologiques, qui rendent difficile l'empathie, puis l'apprentissage. Pareil pour la dyslexie et le bégaiement, 1,5 à 3 fois plus présents chez les garçons.

You're right I apologise. 

&gt;In Spain, the ceasefire announced by Euskadi ta
Askatasuna (ETA, Basque Fatherland and Liberty) on 20
October 2011 held. In 2012 the group carried out no
terrorist attacks. Counter-terrorist activity, at national and international
level, continued in 2012 and resulted in a number
of arrests.

It was Galician sepratists
&gt;Resistência Galega (RG) continued to carry out terrorist attacks
in Galicia in 2012, in volumes similar to 2011, mainly using
improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and IIDs.

The Bulgarian bombings took place in 2012, they are not specified in the stats because 
&gt;""An attack in Bulgaria claimed the lives of seven people in July 2012. At the time of writing the responsibility for this
attack was not determined, although indications suggest possible links to Hezbollah."". 

Though currenty, according to Europol

&gt; According to the Europol, forensic evidence and intelligence sources all point to Hezbollah's involvement in the blast.

Though Hezbollah deny the allegations (not suprising really).

Assuming that the Bulgarian attack are relgiously motivated that takes the total deaths from religiously motivated attacks to 15 for 2012.

&gt;Eight people lost their lives as a result of attacks related to religiously inspired terrorism.

&gt;As someone else pointed out, it is not the fear of terror attacks, but a lot of other stuff, including the rethoric, anti - feminism, honour killings (I know not all of them are commited by Muslims, but they are certainly over represented) female circumscion (same there) etc. Far more than being the fear of dying in a subway, it has to do with having the feeling that our basic values and our way of life under attack.

I do agree but I'm just sick of how all Muslims are apparently to blame for this. When a Christian leader condemns gay people or says women shouldn't be allowed abortion not all Christians are also tarred with the same brush, whereas it seems that's not the case when it comes to Muslims.

Portugal has socialized medicine, but that comes with a price, which is lack of attention to the sick person and overall absolutely revolting strategies. 3 different doctors from the Oncology Institute told us that they couldn't operate on her because the stomach cancer had spread to the pancreas and liver (stage 4) and preferred to play it safe. After going to another doctor that was recommended to us, he told her that he was confident that removing the stomach and part of the liver and then treating the pancreatic cancer directly through rounds of chemo would work. He recommended a private clinic in Switzerland, so we took a shot and about 7 months later she was cancer free. After that, we flew her there every 3 months to get checked out for 2 years. 
Guess what happened when she started doing the check-ups in Portugal again... They didn't detect anything at all, and a couple of months later she started having major pains in the lower abdomen, to the point of not being able to move. They detected the re-incident cancer but took them almost 40 days to put her on an operations room and, of course, there was nothing they could do at that point. Unfortunately, it was impossible to get credit after the crisis started, so we couldn't do nothing about it, other than ease her pain and take care of her for the last months of her life.

&gt; And finally, there is always a cost. If only our limited lifetime involved in the production of a good or service.

Sure, and nothing is infinite. But for all practical purposes, some resources can be considered infinite and some things can be considered effectively free.

&gt; The shortage of needed supply will increase the price and therefore the willingness to supply the good. You need control an entire market to hold a good as hostage. That is highly unlikely in free markets and would lead to new competitors and surrogates, thus eliminating the problem. Alas, free markets are a rare sight.

What fairytale are you living in? This shit has already happened in numerous markets. ""new competitors and surrogates"" what bullshit, that *only* works for non-finite supplies. When a supply has ran out, there will be no new competition.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I do agree but I'm just sick of how all Muslims are apparently to blame for this. When a Christian leader condemns gay people or says women shouldn't be allowed abortion not all Christians are also tarred with the same brush, whereas it seems that's not the case when it comes to Muslims.

I do not know what it is like in the UK, but honestly, I am having a hard time coming up with a Swedish Protestant priest, claiming any of those things - we have lesbian bishops for God's sake. And we have never had female circumscicion and honour killings or hijab/head scarf.

So, the ones mostly speaking/doing these things are immigrants, to a vast majority muslims, (although for example honour killings can be done by other people to I have understood). So, I find it rather natural that we *do* concentrate on the ones commiting those things in Sweden - and they are almost always immigrants, very often Muslims. 

I guess one could say that not all of the immigrants do this, but among those who do, there are almost always immigrants. It is a dilemma, I know (one that was highlighted in Sweden recently when the Muslims were blamed for the riots, and I am not even sure the majority were Muslims, they were immigrants, not the same thing) and frustrating, but I also think the Muslim community could do a lot more to fix this. Why not clearly support homosexuals? Where are those imams? Where are the lesbians imams who refuse to circumscise? I can go on and on about the lack of female precence for one thing, and that is just one thing I can criscise. Yes, I know it is the same in the catholic church, but I have yet to meet a single catholic who cares - female catholic politicians tell them to go away - not exactly the case in Saudi/Iran or among the Muslims here etc is it? So, the blame is also on both sides. 

Also, as I said before, I have more problem with for example negative attitudse towards homosexuals, Jews and women, which *a lot* share, than fear of terror. Get rid of those attitudes, and I think that will go a long way towards understanding. 

I also have a problem with this - some people are so afraid of being racist for example, that the do not speak out. We do not forbid male circumscion for example, although it is harmful to the child. I am ashamed that my country does not label it as the child abuse that it is. ",0,1369848881,null,0,1369849432,0,ca88jhc,t3_1f9ryr,t1_ca88jhc,t1_ca887hm,null,1430994449,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

A parte che statisticamente parlando comunque gli uomini uccidono molto di più -e quindi è giusto IMO concentrarsi di più su quello come problema sociale che sul contrario per mere ragioni di numeri perlomeno.  

La differenza principale è che molto raramente le donne ammazzano/sfregiano irrimediabilmente un uomo che le ha lasciate o che le vuole lasciare perchè non riesce a tollerare il non-possesso. Si, non metto in dubbio che succeda, ma per me è assurdo pretendere che non sia un comportamento molto più prevalente tra gli uomini.

Però pensiamoci: per gli altri uomini, quante volte ci è capitato che la nostra partner ci abbia colpito, fosse per scherzo, rabbia, imbarazzo o altro? A volte ci hanno anche fatto male, volontariamente o meno, no? E quante volte invece noi abbiamo fatto lo stesso con loro? A me non è mai nemmeno passato per la mente di farlo.

true,Thyrotoxic,UKGB,United Kingdom,"At least in Britain most Muslims are fine with homosexuals, abortion and treat women like everybody else does-a human being. Our church leaders have been telling us how homosexual marriage is against gods will etc. as we're about to legalise gay marriage, nobody really pays attention to the CoE anymore anyway.

Immigrants, at least first generation, often have higher crime rates than the native population because they are poorer and less educated. Once you reduce poverty and increase education crime is reduced, it really has nothing to do with culture.

&gt;Why not clearly support homosexuals? Where are those imams? Where are the lesbians imams who refuse to circumcise?

Again it may be different in Sweden (le atheist socialist paradise etc :P) but out church leaders are very much against homosexuality, or at least gay marriage, as are out Muslims. I believe the Jewish faith is a lot more open to the idea (don't quote me on this) but Jews are very often more liberal than most religions. Circumcision is a tricky one, t is part of the Muslim and Jewish faiths, but it still seems pretty barbaric so I don't really know on that one.

&gt;I can go on and on about the lack of female precence [sic] for one thing, and that is just one thing I can criscise[sic].

Again our church (or the laity to be precise) voted against female bishops. Whilst I do agree Islam does have some backwards views when it comes to women, it isn't any different **in a secular state** to that of Christianity (in the UK at least).

&gt;not exactly the case in Saudi/Iran or among the Muslims here etc is it?

Hard to compare a secular democracy to an Islamist dictatorship but yes certain Middle Eastern countries views on a lot of things are completely insane. If there was a similar Christian dictatorship I can't imagine it would be all sun and rainbows but there we go.

A side point was that the report I read didn't include data from the UK (which wasn't playing nicely with the EU that year), but the UK figures were on similar lines; lots of arrests and investigations under terrorism laws, but very few actual terrorists.

17 people killed by terrorists across the EU in 2012, 2 in 2011. But the fear spread by the media, by reports, by government is far, far greater.

Sorry, no, unless you claim this is the way other Brits feel about homosexuals, sharia etc as well.

[Muslims in Britain hold more conservative views on abortion, homosexuality etc](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/may/07/muslims-britain-france-germany-homosexuality)

[2007 survey that shows 61 % of Muslims want to make homosexuality illegal - LGBT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_in_Islam)

[Muslims in Britain on sharia](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/Poll-reveals-40pc-of-Muslims-want-sharia-law-in-UK.html)

Don't you find those attitudes appalling? Honestly, you seem to be seeing the world from rose tinted glasses - I knew this and I am not British :-). Perhaps the ones you meet are nice, I do not oppose that, but they are sadly, not representative. If you are to defend the Muslims in Europe, honorably as it is, one should always start with facts and work from there.

I find these attitudes much more abhorringand frightning, than the abstract fear of terror. Nor do I see them diminishing, they are in fact - increasing. I think it is normal that one fears that - and is disgusted by that. My question is - why isn't the Muslims dealing with this?  

&gt;but out church leaders are very much against homosexuality, or at least gay marriage, as are out Muslims. 

Your church leaders are not against homosexuality as I have understood it, but against gay marriage. Important diffence. Yes, discrimination still, but nothing against what one faces in Islam. With the 4 out of 10 who wants sharia  - what do you think will happens to gay people there? Do you honestly mean that 4 our of 10 non Muslim Brits want to kill off all the gays? I do not belive that, and I will not even get the statistics, I am sure you agree with me :-). 

&gt;Whilst I do agree Islam does have some backwards views when it comes to women, it isn't any different in a secular state to that of Christianity (in the UK at least).

Yes, it is. Your church leaders, a) have less influence, b) the Brits themselves don't seem to give a shit what they church leaders say. As I have proven, the Muslims, in a secular state or not, have *much more* conservative/idiotic views on women, so it does matter - a lot. Also, how many forced marriages and honour killings are there among native Brits in comparison to Muslims - for example. 

Not all Muslims are horrible of course,and I applaud your effort to defend them. However, you should perhaps start out with the facts, and work from there - denying the truth, like with homosexuality or sharia doesn't do anyone any good. 

&gt;If there was  Christian dictatorship I can't imagine it would be all sun and rainbows but there we go.

Yes, but we have quit those centuries ago, because they were barbaric and moronic and it is vital to separate religion/state. That is seldom the case in the Muslim world, and it is not even a trend. In fact, take Egypt where the Muslim Brotherhood won - if they care so much about separation of state/religion and to keep religion out, why them? The trend is unfortunately to mix them up, not throw them out. It is the opposite of what Europe is trying to do actually. So, the majority of the people in Muslim countries says *no* to a secular state (and freedom for women). That should give you some pause - shouldn't it? 

&gt;I'm having fun debating this btw. :D

Our church leaders have been telling us how homosexual marriage is against gods will etc. as we're about to legalise gay marriage, nobody really pays attention to the CoE anymore anyway.

No they aren't. Not at all. [This poll in the Guardian shows Muslims have a zero tolerance attitude toward homosexuality](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/may/07/muslims-britain-france-germany-homosexuality) Yes, that's right. Not one out of the 1000 Muslims interviewed by the pollster ICM said homosexuality was OK. 

&gt;Immigrants, at least first generation, often have higher crime rates than the native population because they are poorer and less educated. Once you reduce poverty and increase education crime is reduced, it really has nothing to do with culture.

Then why are over half of child grooming cases in this country carried out by Muslim gangs? What is it about poverty that makes you go and rape children? Not to mention most of the ring leaders in these gangs are second or even third generation. 

&gt;Again our church (or the laity to be precise) voted against female bishops. Whilst I do agree Islam does have some backwards views when it comes to women, it isn't any different in a secular state to that of Christianity (in the UK at least).

Comparing the attitude toward women held by Muslims and Christians is like comparing chalk and cheese. Yes, the CoE may have said no to female bishops, but Muslims are almost totally unanimous that women cannot even lead prayers. 

&gt;Hard to compare a secular democracy to an Islamist dictatorship but yes certain Middle Eastern countries views on a lot of things are completely insane. If there was a similar Christian dictatorship I can't imagine it would be all sun and rainbows but there we go.

It is dictatorships that have kept most Islamic countries sane. You will notice in Egypt the population, since getting democratic rights, have pushed the governance of the country far more toward Sharia and stricter Islamic values in society. This will also surely happen in Syria. It is happening in Iraq since democracy arrived there.

true,pcapplicant22,null,null,"Hmm. Don't remember exactly how much I had. I think it was around $5,000? Maybe? It could have been $6,000 though, or more and I'm forgetting. I spent every penny of my savings while I was gone, but I intended to when I saved that money, soo...yeah. 

My richy rich roommates ate out constantly, I don't want to imagine what it cost them. Food from the supermercato/mercato is surprisingly cheap. I went a little more than once a week and my main trip bill was usually 20-25 euro. That mostly fed me for 4-7 days, but of course I would forget something or run out of milk, what have you. So maybe assume around 30-40 per week if you cook for yourself? I liked to get coffee a couple times a week (1 or 1.10 euro for espresso, typically), little pastries from a nearby bakery (1 euro when I had them filled with cream, nutella, etc), maybe lunch at a little sandwich place once a week or so (3-5 euro? can't remember well), hot chocolate (3ish euro, usually?) at my favorite little cafe on via dei Pepi, etc. Eating out costs more, though. In my college town in the US, going out for something cheap is between $5-7. In Florence, that'll get you a kebab, sandwich, or pizza, but not much else. The next step up in my town here is probably the $10-15 range. In Florence, I'm not sure there is such a thing. If you sit down for a meal, expect you'll pay at least 15-20 euro.  For me, it was a treat to go out once every 2-3 weeks. 

I traveled a lot, which is why I didn't eat out more. Make sure you're experiencing Italy's food, yes, but don't overdo it if you want to travel a lot. I was lucky, I had my friend in England and then Rome and my sister in Grenoble, France, so I had places to stay. I stayed with each for a week on the way in and with the friend in Rome on the way out- with free accommodations. Search early for couchsurfing hosts or, if you're uncomfortable with that, for airbnb accommodations. If you manage to find places to stay for free, plan for the plane ticket round trip (usually 60-100 euro each way), food, extra cell phone bill if you use your cell there, tourist attractions, etc. I'd say I probably spent around 100-150 euro if I already had accommodations/transportation covered, up to 400 without for a weekend/long weekend trip. 

Also, consider odd destinations. Croatia is much cheaper than France, for instance. I went to Istanbul for spring break to visit a friend. My roommate and I stayed with couchsurfing hosts, had an amazing time, ate lots of delicious food (only the Turks can even compete with Italian food), etc. I spent probably 120 each way for plane tickets, nothing for accommodations, and about 200 euro there, which wasn't too bad for 6 days. If I'd tried to do the same in England or Germany or something, I'd have broken the bank. Also, warning, Switzerland is notoriously expensive. Talk to others who have gone before booking a trip there, unless all accommodation/food is covered and it's a cheap trip somehow.

It's not that you shouldn't follow the teachings by the letter, it's that there are a lot of different views on what those ""teachings"" actually mean and how the Bible is supposed to be read. Different branches of Christianity interpret the Bible differently, but I've personally never heard any of them argue that whatever they teach shouldn't be followed as they say it should. What, I think, most Christians would agree on though is that there is nothing wrong with not believing the same as what they believe. But, as a Christian, to give up the argument and admit to being wrong is something different entirely.

Now, for the relevant/important part: Even though most Christians are very convinced and somewhat stubborn with their beliefs and opinions, they will still obey the law and won't, with violence, fight against those who believe differently. [The Bible even teaches that.](http://www.openbible.info/topics/obeying_the_law)

Now, this is of course only true in *most* cases. As with anything there are exceptions (idiots) to the rule. The important thing to remember here though is that the Bible, by most interpretations and as taught by acknowledged theologians, doesn't teach us to disobey the law or with violence fight other men. That is something taught by people, not the Bible. And the Bible, by most accounts, is what a Christian bases his life on.

true,Thyrotoxic,UKGB,United Kingdom,"After a bit of searching I found this which could explain the sharia part.

&gt;There was a new ICM poll of British Muslims in the Sunday Telegraph. The finding in the poll that got the most coverage was a question that suggested that 40% of British Muslims supported “there being areas in Britain which are pre-dominately Muslim and in which sharia law is introduced”. Since Western perceptions of sharia law tend to focus upon stoning adulterers, executing apostates and amputating the limbs of thieves reporting has tended to react with some horror. It’s worth remembering though that respondents could be thinking of a far more limited use of sharia law – until this month, for example, Ontario in Canada allowed the use of sharia law in civil disputes on things such as divorce, contract law and so on. I suspect respondents to ICM’s survey were more likely to have been thinking of Muslim communities in the UK deciding cases of family and inheritance law on the basis of sharia, as opposed to stonings and beheadings in Brick Lane – though from the wording of the question it is impossible to tell.

Source:http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/146

The poll is also seven years old. I also believe we have voluntary Sharia Councils that, if both parties wish, small disputes and family matters can be settled at.

I do find the attitudes to homosexuality quite worrying actually, those stats surprised me, especially the fact that younger people tend to be more devout.

Though I have found this stat about the wider British attitudes on homosexuality. I can't find the paper (I'm not on campus so don't have access to any journals) but I have found a [reference](http://humanism.org.uk/campaigns/religion-and-belief-some-surveys-and-statistics/the-british-social-attitudes-survey/) that states ""50% of religious people believe homosexuality is always or almost always wrong"". As I've said earlier I don't particularly like religion, it's unfair and has historically been a way to keep the poor *in their place*.

The number 2 poll you have referenced also states that 49% of Muslims want reinterpretation of Sharia to fit into modern values, 39% for no reinterperation, with only 28% wanting sharia at all (a difference of 12%, fairly significant).
&gt;Therefore, the majority of Muslims does
not want
sharia
law and is opposed to its
implementation in Britain. Among those
who would like to live by
sharia
, more
would prefer to see it reinterpreted than
not. This is important to stress, because
statistics about
sharia
can wrongly give the
impression that Muslims who want to live
by it are in favour of the most brutal pun-
ishments and strict regulations, which
many non-Muslims feel alienated by. 

I have met a lot of Muslims and they are great, but I haven't quizzed them on their beliefs about homosexuality etc. and I'm not gay so it hasn't come up in conversation.

La question, c'est:  
- voulaient ils parler sur ce sujet?  
- qui les en a empêché, concrètement? Ont ils été menace de représailles s'ils proféraient une opinion éclairée anti-marriage gay? Ont ils tenté de publier une tribune ou un éditoriale, seulement pour être rejeter par tous les médias?

Si tu n'es pas capable de concrétiser tes propos, comment peux tu être sur que tu n'est pas simplement dans une fantaisie remplie de gens intelligents contre le mariage gay qui sont malheureusement victime d'un complot du silence.

&gt; Mathématiquement, c'est assez facile à prouver.

Ça me rappelle Bush 43 aux états-unis, qui a poussé très fort pour enseigner l'abstinence aux adolescents américains. C'est pareil, l'abstinence, c'est mathématiquement parfait, encore mieux que la fidélité.  
Apparemment, ça a marché super bien, et les maman adolescentes sont une chose du passé. Ou l'inverse, je ne rappelle jamais.

Mais je m’égare un peu. Comme tu dis, ""Qui demande l'interdiction des capotes ?""

Effectivement, qui en bonne conscience tenterai d'interdire ça a un pays complet sur la base seule que ce n'est pas approuvé par l'Eglise? Tu as raison, ça n'a aucun sens.

De manière peut-être un peu plus générale, si je peux, l'Eglise est elle vraiment en charge de forcer ses pratiques, coutumes et règles sur le reste du pays?  
Ou est-elle plutôt supposée être avant tout en charge des ses brebis?  
Quel serait le vrai message d'un philosophe Catholique éclairé arguant contre le mariage gay, sinon de promouvoir le message fondamental que la doctrine de l'Eglise doit être la loi de la France?

C'est peut-être pour ça qu'ils sont dur a trouver, les éclairés qui veulent tenir ce genre de propos.

I agree but I'm not left enough to start a revolution I'm afraid. :P

true,BananaPeelSlippers,null,null,"As an American i look back on the ellis island days with great pride, that is not the kind of immigration going on today... stats from the article regarding the stockholm riots that IM SURE YOU READ... 

* In 2012, Sweden accepted 44,000 asylum seekers, making Sweden relative to its size the world's most open destination for refugees.

* The 2012 asylum level represented a 50% jump over the rate of asylum acceptance just the year before.

* In less than a single decade, the foreign-born share of the Swedish population has risen from under 10% to over 15%.

* Unemployment among immigrants exceeds 16%; among native Swedes, it is only 6%.

* Despite a heavily redistributionist tax system and a generous welfare state, the wealth gap between natives and immigrants is wide and apparently widening.

* Sweden's asylum seekers come almost entirely from very poor Muslim-majority countries, notably Iraq, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Syria.

* Swedish authorities are notoriously tight-lipped about the connection between immigration and crime. Sweden does not report data on crimes by foreign-born people, only by foreign passport holders - meaning that an immigrant who has been naturalized will be counted as a Swede for statistical purposes. Even on that restrictive basis, it's apparent there is a real problem. In 2010, almost 30% of the people in Swedish prisons held foreign passports. A broader study of crime statistics from 1997-2001 - that is, well before the recent immigration surge - found that immigrants and children of immigrants together committed more than 40% of all Swedish crime. In particular, immigrants and children of immigrants were five times more likely than native Swedes to be investigated for sex crimes, a rising Swedish concern. 

* Sweden has a center-right government with a strong libertarian flavor. Prime Minister Frederik Reinfeldt, whose office since 2006 has enthusiastically welcomed the asylum influx during his administration: ""We are more open than other countries. Long term, as a society, we win on this. It will lead to more people getting jobs. It will contribute to a more exciting and open society.”

This is not a situation that creates a healthy population, immigration at this level will segment the population and make it so that their is not a british, or swedish, or whatever countries identity. I think a lot of this occurs intentionally because of the pro-euro anti-national sovereignty movements. Why would first generation arabs care if britain stays or leaves the euro?

I do worry - as long as attitudes like that are increasing it is a cause to worry. I would be OK if they (attitudes) were on the decrease, but they are not. 

&gt;f and like evrery other religion they're against gay marriage 

No, we (Lutherans) have gay marriages, female bishops etc. 

Also - what you forget to mention is that Muslims are much more likely to describe themselves as religious/very religious etc (I forgot the study, but I can find it if you want, at least they are in Sweden). That means that they are much more likely to listen to their leaders, compared to Catholic Germans for example, who might go to church once in a blue moon. So, they are much more likely to hate homosexuality. And - what are the Muslims doing about it? I mean, you even said it yourself, their biggest organisation is doing nothing. 

&gt;Baby steps.

What? It is 2013, I refuse to take baby steps against barbarianism and discrimination. So, if we take baby steps, in what year do *you* expect them to have normal attitudes, and to treat women and gays like equals? It is 2013, they are living in Europe where we clearly speak against those thing in every law, official paper etc -if the shoe do not fit, fuck them. How can you tolerate discrimination? I mean, you do not support their intolerance and discrimination - how can you then tolerate it, or the fact that they aren't changing - in fact they are becoming *worse*. Isn't that very, very, scary? At what point do you think they should react? 

&gt;People say this but immigrants and Muslims are scutinised to hell, I don't know what it's like in Sweden but atm the British are having huge debates about immigration and the papers are spouting their opinions on it too.

So, if the are then a) why didn't you even know about their attitiudes towards women and gays and democracy/sharia etc b) why aren't they changing?

I think that a suitable environment is a stable one, as remote as possible from violence, where the child is reasonably cared for, and where the parents give the child opportunities, at least intectual if not financial. The child will choose its sexual orientation when the time comes. 

Finally, AFAIK it's not because one's parents are gay that he'll be gay: gay people often have straight parents, so, why would the contrary be impossible?

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;What would you have done to them, have them all deported? We live in a democracy and that means people can and will disagree with you. It will be a slow struggle but they will eventually come around. There will always be people who are bigots, who are against gay people that will never change.

No, I haven't said deported - you said that. I say one shouldn't be allowed permanent recidence without education about equal law, etc, tests etc. Also, one should be able to deport the families of those poor victims of the ""honour system"". What they are doing is obviously illegal, and should be treated as such. If they are citizens - jail for a very long time and should not be allowed to raise their other kids if they have any. Money to schools, social workers, police etc to enforce it, but there probably needs new laws. Obviously, the Muslim (and happily Catholic etc) should be treated *much, much* harder with regards to their stance on gay people. You enforce hate speech against Britain - why not against gays or women? Certainly if someone bloody preech it, or treat them as less worthy. 

Also, one can't change the attitude of the people who already live here, but one can refuse to accept more people in the country who are like that. Not that all Muslims/immigrant (certainly not all are, nor are all Christian/Hindu etc nice), but I have not problem that one has to take courses/alternative sign some sort of paper. If one later on ignores it, well, then you have broken the law, haven't you? 

Also - are you sure that the equality laws are vigorously enforced, everywhere? They are most certainly not in Sweden. Religious schools seems to get a pass, of course they should be closed down if they do not promote equality for gays, women etc. I am pretty sure it is not enforced in Britain - you do have Catholic schools don't you? Close them, win back the minds of the young people.  

Also - ban circumsicion. It is a barabaric rite that removes 10 % of the nervends and a lot of feeling for men. Anyone who cut of 10 % of a females clitoris would be called a barbarian, why should men be treated differently? Men deserve their sexual organs too. That will solve the problems with the most religious too.........

&gt;We can't ban religion as much as society might improve, it's morally wrong.

No, nor should we, but we can ban the actions of religion or  involvment in public life. Nor should one get a pass.

Above all - the catholic church is called out the whole time for their attitude towards women and homosexuality. I *do not* see Muslims called out for that. They should be - every day. No one should get away with it. 

&gt;There will always be people who are bigots, who are against gay people that will never change.

But, among non Muslims that number is decreasing, every year. It will never reach zero, but is getting lower every year. Among Muslims - increasing, and you don't see a problem with that? How much discrimination is OK in your book? You say Muslims are discriminated, but why aren't you defending women and gay people? 


&gt;You keep on saying more should be done but don't offer any solutions yourself.

Neither are you. You are *accepting* their discrimination, that is far, far worse. What do you think should be done apart from tolerating intolerance? You haven't offered any solution either - give me some then.

The crisis has hit Barcelona harder than most of Spain--it's one of the economic centers of Spain, so the problems are more concentrated here than elsewhere. Finding a good job will likely be difficult. There's really no indication of an imminent recovery. This isn't to say there aren't *any* jobs; there are, they're just hard to find or require pretty specialized knowledge.

On top of that, academia is having a pretty rough time of it. I have a friend whose lab just lost almost all of its funding, so 2 years into a PhD she has to leave. I have a couple of professors whose jobs are very uncertain after next year. This is a reality of academic pursuits in Spain.

That being said, there *is* a good academic culture here, and Barcelona is a good center for a lot of research. UB and UPC are particularly active research environments, and I am consistently blown away by just how much is going on. There is more research happening in my particular subfield (mathematical logic) than in the math and computer science departments at my undergrad, which is a ""research institute.""

true,Thyrotoxic,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Ok I'll offer my ideas and comment on a few of yours too.

&gt;No, I haven't said deported - you said that. I say one shouldn't be allowed permanent recidence without education about equal law, etc, tests etc. Also, one should be able to deport the families of those poor victims of the ""honour system"". What they are doing is obviously illegal, and should be treated as such. If they are citizens - jail for a very long time and should not be allowed to raise their other kids if they have any. Money to schools, social workers, police etc to enforce it

I agree with you 100% here (perhaps aiming at rehabilitation not punishment for jail). If they are British citizens then they cannot be deported and should be jailed, if they are not then yes they should be deported to their country of origin, honour killings are thankfully still rare but they are horrific. More money should go to education in general, but increased funding to both the police and social service (eg. social workers, care home staff etc.) as well as HMP service would be good too.

&gt;Obviously, the Muslim (and happily Catholic etc) should be treated much, much harder with regards to their stance on gay people. You enforce hate speech against Britain - why not against gays or women? Certainly if someone bloody preech it, or treat them as less worthy. 

Our hate speech laws basically stop people from threatening violence or being abusive or insulting (there's a campaign to get insulting remove as a lot of people think it's too broad). What our hate speech laws doesn't stop are reasonable discussion about things.

Some people obviously are against gay marriage and have their (frankly bullshit) reason. But we do live in a democracy and a key tenet of democracy is the ability to discuss ideas without being arrested. As long as nobody is threatening violence then I personally don't think they should be prosecuted.

&gt;Also, one can't change the attitude of the people who already live here, but one can refuse to accept more people in the country who are like that. Not that all Muslims/immigrant (certainly not all are, nor are all Christian/Hindu etc nice), but I have not problem that one has to take courses/alternative sign some sort of paper. If one later on ignores it, well, then you have broken the law, haven't you? 

I'm not quite sure what you mean by sign some paper, do you mind clarifying for me.

There isn't much we can do about immigration, we have to let anybody in from the EU though out current government have made noises about a points based system which I'm not particularly sure on.

 &gt;Also - are you sure that the equality laws are vigorously enforced, everywhere? They are most certainly not in Sweden. Religious schools seems to get a pass, of course they should be closed down if they do not promote equality for gays, women etc. I am pretty sure it is not enforced in Britain - you do have Catholic schools don't you? Close them, win back the minds of the young people. 

We do have religious schools and I think it's outrageous they still exist. They serve no pupose that a normal school serves other than to add indoctirnation of what ever faith the school is. Whether Hindu, Muslim CoE or Catholic. I'd shut them down an install secular governors and ensure a secular curriculum is taught (including a balanced religious education course).

&gt;Also - ban circumsicion. It is a barabaric rite that removes 10 % of the nervends and a lot of feeling for men. Anyone who cut of 10 % of a females clitoris would be called a barbarian, why should men be treated differently? Men deserve their sexual organs too. That will solve the problems with the most religious too.........

It's different from female circumcision but I agree I think it should be legal as an adult. You shouldn't be allowed to circumcise a child unless it's required for medical reasons. It is completely barbaric.    

Basically more, better quality education is the key. It's easier to stop indoctrination if you teach somebody logic and reason.

L'iniziativa, tenutasi 8 settembre 2007[2] in numerose piazze italiane e presso diverse ambasciate italiane all'estero, e seguita in diretta televisiva da EcoTv, nei fatti è stata la prosecuzione dell'iniziativa Parlamento pulito che il comico genovese aveva condotto attraverso il suo blog.
Secondo quanto successivamente pubblicato dal blog di Grillo, durante l'iniziativa furono raccolte 336.144 firme,[3] di molto eccedenti le 50.000 necessarie alla presentazione della proposta di legge di iniziativa popolare. Il successo dell'iniziativa oltrepassò le previsioni degli organizzatori, tanto che in diverse città andarono presto esauriti i moduli predisposti per la raccolta delle firme.",0,1369862556,null,0,false,0,ca8dpe7,t3_1f9sea,t1_ca8dpe7,t1_ca8de0b,null,1430991944,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

true,Thyrotoxic,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;In 2012, Northern Ireland experienced 24 involved attacks on national security targets. There were no other attacks on national security
targets in the UK in 2012. Attacks on national security include those targeting principally (but not exclusively) the security forces, those
who support them and premises and institutions associated with policing, justice and security.

Four took place in France and two in Belgium.

&gt;The combination of radicalised individuals resident in EU
Member States with intent to commit attacks, and their accessing
of terrorist literature, was evidenced in April 2012,
when four males of Bangladeshi and Pakistani origin were
arrested in the UK. The subjects were suspected of plotting
attacks in the UK and were subsequently charged with engaging
in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism. Several
of the suspects were additionally charged with possession
of extremist material. In early March 2013, the defendants
pleaded guilty to engaging in conduct in preparation of
acts of terrorism and will be sentenced later in the year.
At least one such apparent home-grown religiously inspired
plot may have been motivated by the activities of an English
nationalist group. In July 2012, six people were arrested and
subsequently charged with engaging in conduct in preparation
of acts of terrorism. They are all suspected of plotting
an attack in South Yorkshire.

Perhaps because they didn't actually have a plan and were still ""engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism"" they are not counted in the stats. You raise a good point though.

Those political identities were a partial outgrowth of religious identities as, in NI, those political identities became more closely aligned with the national identities than they previously were, particularly amongst the Protestant religious majority there[1], which lead to things like Lord Craigavon's ""A Protestant parliament for a Protestant people"" slogan, gerrymandering, and civil rights issues. Amongst NI Catholics, there was no strong correlation between being Catholic and being a nationalist, and there still isn't. In fact, the best recruiting tool the IRA ever got was the brutal way the civil rights movement (which contained people from both Catholic *and* Protestant backgrounds) in NI was repressed[2].

Things have eased since then, but it's important to understand that the sectarianism in NI is *politically* based, not religiously based, even though there is an overlap in identities there. The Troubles came out of the religious chauvinism[3] of the NI state up until the dissolution of the former Stormont parliament, but are not currently *motivated* by religious chauvinism. On that basis they can't be described as religiously motivated.

NI politics are subtle.

[1] Previous to partition, there had been no real correlation between religious identity and separatism, except in that most of the nationalist leaders were, in fact, anglicans! The post 1916 clusterfuck just ended up polarising people.

True, the killings are rare, but there are a lot of females (and some males) that are not killed, but living basically as prisoners, their movements so restricted. Also, a lot of them are forced to marry people not of their choosing. In Sweden, I think the number is over 10 000, so it must be huge in Britain. Again, not only Muslims, but whoever continues this practise should be severly punished. 

&gt;What our hate speech laws doesn't stop are reasonable discussion about things.

I know that it is fleeting, but it is nothing reasonable about saying gays should be punished by death. Sharia says so btw, so anyone supporting sharia, is supporting that. It is nothing reasonable about saying women is inferior, it is horrible. although I understand it can be hard to prosecute it.

&gt;There isn't much we can do about immigration, we have to let anybody in from the EU though out current government have made noises about a points based system which I'm not particularly sure on.

Yes, one can. One can can say no to asylum seekers that refuse to educate themselves, or one whatever category people from Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, Russia (very homophobic) fall under. However, about the EU you are right, but the increase among Muslims homophobic, is hardly the Dutch or Spaniards, is it? 

&gt;Whether Hindu, Muslim CoE or Catholic. I'd shut them down an install secular governors and ensure a secular curriculum is taught (including a balanced religious education course).

Exactly - I am so tired of catering to religion. 

&gt;but I agree I think it should be legal as an adult.

OK, if they want to do it then, I am OK with it. Before, they can have some sort of meaningless ritual instead of circumciscion - perhaps wetting the head or something while uttering a few phrases.....


&gt;Basically more, better quality education is the key. It's easier to stop indoctrination if you teach somebody logic and reason.

Well, not just, even though we are in agreeing there. It is a war, over minds, and it has to be fought on all fronts. So, the media, politicians etc *has* to call them out. What have the muslims leaders done for the lesbians today? Etc. Also, legally it has to be fought much harder. 

As it is, the numbers are really depressing, and it is getting worse. 

I know you started out with defending the Muslims against being terrorist, and I agree with you there. However, that is not what scares me, not at all (I'm a scientist, I am more likely to die of a gazillion things). I am scared and frightened that unequality, anti - feminism, anti democracy (sharia laws are against that), anti secular state, anti gay - attitudes are on the rise in the Muslim community. And, that nothing is being done to change that. 

And, we can discuss that how much we want, but in the end only the Muslims themselves can change that, and they don't seem really keen to (as a community of course, individuals can most certainly act differently). So, how long should we accept a community with those attitudes? How long should we tolerate hate and intolerance? And why?

Put it this way.
You're Norwegain, I'll take it, according to your flair.

Sweden and Denmark have both taken over Norway in the past, right?

Dictatorship Sweden decides to come into Norway and kill hundreds of thousands of Norwegians because they're not Swedes. Denmark, Norway's ally, decides to step in, and protect Norway. Denmark and Sweden battle. Sweden loses, and they're forced to repair and repay what damages have been done, as well as become a Republic.
70 years from now, when the majority of people in Sweden have lived under the republic and had *nothing* to do with the previous war, and some old Norwegian man who suffered during the war wants compensation, why should new-generation, modern democractic Swedes have to pay for what their previous Dictatorship did?

These services are comprehensive, even if they are usually attached to one or the othe rehabilitation provider, such as the Rentenversicherung. Just google that to find one of these near you. They might be able to tell you how the process is supposed to work, what legal deadlines for the decision over your application the rehabilitation provider has to stick to (§14 (2) SGB IX) and whether or not it makes any sense to file a complaint to the current rehabilitaiton provider for leaving you alone with that matter and not even get the school or the Jugendhilfe involvend immediately just because the lady doesn't ""have the time"" to do so. The Gemeinsame Servicestelle also might be able to get into contact with this provider to fasten things up for you. You can also get information on applying for the ""Personal Budget"" if you would prefer to employ the assistence personell yourself rather than having everything organized by the rehabilitation provider.

I have few complaints about the fresh fruits, vegetables, breads, fish and meat that we get at the market and at the bakery, and which make up the vast majority of our diet. 

&gt; Jumbo, Deen, Aldi Dekamarkt or C1000 (they all sell different products).

This I disagree with. Well, Aldi has some weird stuff, but the others overlap almost completely. I'm within a few minutes walk of AH, Aldi, Vomar, Deen, and Deka, and visit each one pretty much every week. There are a handful of unique items I get at each one, but generally it doesn't matter except for the few cent differences on price. And annoyingly, whenever there's something I enjoy, they all discontinue it at the same time. So clearly the distribution chain is pretty monolithic.

&gt; Small ethnic shops, Turkish, Maroccan, Spanish, Surinamese, Chinese, Japanese etc.

The larger branches of Amazing Oriental incorporate all the Asian as well as some Surinamese and other stuff, at lower prices compared to the dusty small shops. For example, a large bottle of California Sriracha is around €3,50 at Amazing and usually close to €6 everywhere else.

The three provisions in it are introduced with the phrase that those debts and obligations *can* be (partially) forfeited. Not that they don't exist anymore.

Also, the word Verbindlichkeit in the article (which you rightly translated to ""debts"") has nothing to do with paying injury awards to Holocaust survivors. Verbindlichkeit is the business between debtors and borrowers - such an arrangement never took place between European jews and the government of the German Reich, as we are all aware of. What took place is expulsion, expropriation and mass genocide.

Since its foundation in 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany has accepted the place of being the legal successor of the German Reich, quite contrary to the German Democratic Republic til 1989. That means that legal cases that can rightly be brought up against the German Reich can't be thrown out of court just because the Reich doesn't exist anymore. 

The German government holds itself responsible to the crimes that were committed by it's predecessors in power. De jure, that's necessary and right.

Morally as a German I have to say that we committed one of the worst crimes in human history against so many people that we as a prosperous nation *are* still bound by the horrors our forefathers committed and we have to make small sacrifices like this to repay our debt to civilization. It is a crime that transcended space and time, literally. It directly affects the children of survivors who had no extended family anymore to help care for them - those people could be as young as 40 today. It directly affects the children who survived the Holocaust, without parents or anybody else, who could be 70 today. It directly affects the adult survivors, who will surely pass the 100 year mark soon. We committed a horrible pain on the world and we *should* pay for it - that bit of money doesn't hurt us, it doesn't make everything ""right"" but it's something.

There are groups affected by the Holocaust that haven't received much of anything from us and that is the real shame today. Roma and Sinti, who suffered massively under Nazi rule, weren't even accepted as ""true Holocaust victims"" until the 1990's (!)

To summarize, modern day Germany has everything to do with the German Reich. Legally, morally and humanly. At the very least until no one is alive anymore who has seen the smokestacks of Auschwitz or Treblinka. But possibly it will be longer than that.

Oh? You said:

&gt; The US and UK are to blame for whats happening to the Palestinians. Hitler had nothing to do with it.

How is that not assigning responsibility for the Palestinians' condition to the US and UK? What other interpretation could there be?

&gt; Do you think that jews just had an idea and walked into Palestine empty handed and got what they wanted? There were several UK banks that funded israeli settlements. They had huge support from the west, from jews AND Christians. A quick google search can tell you that. the US started sending aid to Israel starting in the late 40's, that is a fact.

Jewish-British bankers (like the Rothschilds or the Montefiores) bought land for the Zionist endeavour, but there was no substantial assistance by non-Jewish British institutions other than symbolic statements made by HM government. And where is the idea that the Jews had ""huge support from the west?"" The only military aid the Jews received during the War of Independence was from Stalin (via Czechoslovakia).

I admit that I was wrong. The US did send some aid to Israel beginning right after independence. However, this was small-scale, entirely non-military before 1959, and America was funding Arab allies as much if not more at the same time, so that aid doesn't reflect any particular favoritism towards Israel in that time period.",0,1369884181,null,0,false,0,ca8l46j,t3_1f9wcm,t1_ca8l46j,t1_ca8kl09,null,1430988381,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

We even did very good right after the the end of the 2008 section of the crisis (not too much like you'd expect a very much service based economy like ours to do) but then troubles in southern Europe started to pull on us a little. 

We were/are in fact worried about the fine though. Or at least the newspapers were. I guess less urgency or threath gives us a little more breathing space to break rules.

On the other hand I hope the current economic slowdown at least gives root to a bit of political will to change a few things. I can't check how correct this actually is or if it's just more newspaper fear mongering but some dude calculated that the kids born now would have to pay a ton more for to mother state if we want the current welfare state we have going to continue as it is now. A ton more as in about the price of a house. This concerns me a bit considering also I am not too old (in my early 20's).

I understand that so many people are against cutting state funded jobs, reducing pay, austerityjabajaba. But I hope that if they don't want it now (I don't even know if they have a choice without shared debt in some countries) that they actually vote for change to the stuff that caused this recession to occur when the threat has dissapeared. I wish the same from politicians because political will is hard to find when they'd rather suck dicks for votes then do something drastic or ""not so fun"" like increasing taxes or cutting jobs. It seems that Germany did the right thing that way about 10 years ago.

true,nod23,NORW,Norway,"&gt;Tax credits are a spending program though

They are in a budget debate, which is the article's point, but in real terms it's not. Hold your downvotes for a moment.

&gt; The only difference is that high income families will end up getting a smaller tax bill, while lower income families will receive money back..

Which is my point exactly, *that* doesn't result in equal access.

&gt; It doesn't matter if welfare is being distributed through the tax code or through direct cash transfers

Oh, it does matter. This is going to be a little specific. Take for example public childcare, in my own country every child is entitled to a kindergarten seat regardless of their parents' income or profession. 

- It means single mothers or immigrants can work *full time* instead of spending more money [proportionally] than a nuclear family. 

- It's an equalizer. Research shows that attending kindergarten gives children of immigrants better language skills and social integration. Which means better education, less poverty and crime. 

- Children in general do better in school when they attend kindergarten. 

The ""American"" alternative is a small cash amount, as you said. The wealthy don't care, the rest of us do (middle classes). In many countries including the US and UK, that small amount doesn't even cover the basic childcare cost. What you get for your money also matters, because a public kindergarten is regulated and staffed here. They may be run by privately held companies.

- In the UK it's so expensive mothers often quit their jobs and stay at home. So the labor market loses a worker, society loses an investment [in her education], the child loses integration and social skills that matter in its development and education.

What I assume you might not like is that many Europeans accept that we pay an ""unfair"" amount of taxes. There is no school tax where I live, but we have *proportional* tax systems. The majority pays for services they might not use, such as kindergartens or schools, but it benefits us all.

The effect is a more equal and balanced society. The Gini coefficient index is one way of shining a little light on things. It shows a much better income distribution, less poverty and less crime in [Western] European countries.

Hyperbole aside. We do have things like farmer's markets and ethnic markets  and specialty bakeries. I'll concede that, and edit the post. 

I'm having memory and word issues right now, so when I get on a roll, I tend to go with whatever comes at hand. 

There's one street in the city where I live where you start at the center of town, and you can walk past a two ethnic stores, a cheese shop, three bakeries, a fish store, and if you go on the right day at the right time you can hit both the city market and the town square market. 

I can take the bus to get my hair done at 8, be done by 9, walk down through the center towards city hall and have all my shopping done by 10, and be home before 11, all without ever going to a grocery store - but there is one on the way home from the bus stop, if I've forgotten my milk.

I've never had that luxury living in the States. I would either have to live immediately close to the Store; or drive from one side of the city to the next in something that would take hours of errands to accomplish (I lived in Dallas; so I'm up to 6 million). I love that sort of sprawl and the fun and the business of Dallas, don't get me wrong, but I don't know how to *find* half the things in Dallas (I lived for half a year near a huge bollywood theater in Irving before I had any idea it was even there).

Il mio punto qui è che nessun dibattito sull'uguaglianza dovrebbe basarsi su argomenti del tipo ""eh tanti anni fa si stava tanto peggio"" per giustificare i successi ottenuti o gli obiettivi ancora da perseguire. Io preferisco una base più solida del tipo: il diritto di voto è conseguenza imprescindibile dello status di cittadino in una repubblica democratica. La cittadinanza non contempla differenze di sesso.

Argomentare invece che le donne non votassero perché gli venisse impedito dall'alto, da una casta misogina e crudele è soltanto facile demagogia, che glissa spaventosamente sul nocciolo del problema (la coscienza politica delle masse rispetto a quella dell'aristocrazia), sottolineandone soltanto l'aspetto più folkloristico.",0,1369900522,null,0,false,0,ca8p17o,t3_1f9zb6,t1_ca8p17o,t1_ca8fspg,null,1430986522,0,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,0

And French is still prominent due to Quebecs international position?

I agree that English has been made even more common due to the US, but the Empire's strech and the lack of alternatives in the first/third world due to 2 great wars plays as much as an important role in this. Your statement is a gross oversimplification, to say the least.

To elaborate: 

I think American English would not have had such an easy way with the world if great parts of Africa, India, Australia and the Americas hadn't already spoken it. 

Furthernmore, without the lack of alternative, we might not see a dominant language at all at the moment (think of how it was pre-1990; half of the world spoke Russian as their trade language).

And even a bilingual world wasn't that certain!

Pre-WWI (or even WWII), German was one of the, if not the most dominant language in the natural sciences. In trade, English already ruled the waves for centuries, but it didn't get to dominate this area. After German fell out of fashion due to well known reasons, English and Russian quickly subsumed its place where appropriate.

In short, American influence certainly plays a role. But it is not in any case the biggest, nor most important factor, because it builds up on quite a lot of other events.",0,1369900721,null,0,false,0,ca8p29y,t3_1f9c6v,t1_ca8p29y,t1_ca8mfye,null,1430986507,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

That's not what I was driving at. I didn't even make any distinction between British and American English. 

I was disagreeing with the statement that English is only of any importance due to the US.

&gt;More because of our former colonial empire. Personally I don't think there is much to be proud of there.

*This* is what I was getting at - the reasons why English could be so effective in the hands of the Americans. The groundwork laid by the Empire is one important one, the lack or destruction of alternatives is another.

It's not like ~3/4 (!) of the world didn't have some experience of some form of English already, and US influence converted them. I argue that English was a dominant trade language already, *but one bound to a particular Empire*. If that Empire was to crumble, English would go with it (see how Russian declined in importance after 1990).

The US cut that particular geographical and political dependence, and linked it to their economy - this allowed English to not only survive but retain its importance and even grow. Of course, as you said, with the American brand (which is not really existent in itself, as there are myriad of different dialects spoken in the continental US alone).

I don't really care what kind of English emerges. Language is a natural process, and I don't draw artifical cultural or political lines. If history teaches us anything, it's that - hopefully - people adapt their language as it is most sensible to them. There was talk about this ""Globish"", I do not know how true it is.

Germany in its present state may not be obliged to paying money to Holocaust survivors, in a strict legal sense. However, the German postwar society was built on the premise that we will never - ever - let something like the Holocaust happen again. This sentiment is, I think, still strong in today's German society and, IMO, it should be a categorical imperative for *every* society. 

This is more an act of solidarity than an act of ""guilt"". It is a sign of honoring the survivors of the Holocaust and an act of showing that German society has changed, even if money can't outweigh the horror imposed on people during the Holocaust (which is obviously the case). I don't know any German who, in their right mind, would argue that these payments are somehow unjust or wasted. As Germans, we are not separate individuals existing in empty space like atoms. We are part of a solidary community that shares a common history and common relations to people ""outside"" of our community.

Who exactly should pay for this if not the German state? I don't think it's a matter of debate whether or not Jewish survivors (let's just use Jewish here for the sake of simplicity) of the Holocaust deserve some sort of compensation for their suffering, even if money can obviously never make up the crimes committed. Who should pay this? Do you really think the state of Israel should have to pay monetary compensation to surviviors of the Holocaust? Or any other state?

If anybody, Germans should do this. Not because we are obliged to do it in a strict sense. We are part of a solidary community (society). It's not like our present society exists in an empty space, completely disconnected from past generations. We are, in many ways, the heirs of past German generations, including the one responsible for the Holocaust (and that's not even accounting for the numerous Nazi criminals still alive). ""Our"" wealth, for example, is not wealth aquired solely by the present generation, it's wealth aquired through an historic process spanning multiple decades, involving lots and lots of different people.

true,JrMint,FRAN,France,"This is simply a comment on the level of English of French individuals in EU government. The list is comprised mainly of false friends (""actual"" vs. ""actuel"", etc) which are extremely common and shouldn't be hard to master. Some of it, however, is nitpicking on the part of these British translators. I don't see anything wrong with GPS, the American equivalent of ""satnav"". They shouldn't either since they admit ""cellphone"" to be acceptable. Interpreters shouldn't need to be called in for every board meeting in companies or in governments, but it behooves us to use as clear and concise a diction as possible in documents that are essentially for the citizens of the governed area. I feel exactly the same way about the inverse: recently French Industrial Recovery minister Arnaud Montebourg was warned about needlessly using English in his official government documents. He used ""Silver Economy"" to describe an aging labor population of seniors (""silver"" referring to their hair). He justified it saying that they wanted to use the language that seemed to be the most apt for the situation, as if it were a long-established term in English like ""chic"" or ""business"". I've never heard this term in English and had no idea what it meant before he attempted to explain it in French. ""Economie argentée"" would've been equally unintelligible. It may be a cute term, but the proper term in French and English would be greying economy, or économie grisonnante. But the English formulation certainly isn't common enough to justify using it in French-state documents to the detriment of the citizens who might desire to read it.

Anyway, back to the original point. Frankly, if this situation were reversed, and we were talking about ""les erreurs les plus communes en français faites dans les documents officiels du gouvernement"", there would be a huge outcry from the French and pointless debates of stylistic minutiae on how foreigners get French so wrong.

I do nevertheless think that the last point made in the article has some merit: having French teachers teach in English to French students is merely going to perpetuate poor English habits if it does not coincide with more focus on correct English communication through native or university-level professors. That is not to say that the recently voted French law permitting more non-language classes being taught in English is bad. It's a step in the right direction. It should also legalize the already common practice of inviting foreign teachers whose native language might not even be English though for want of a sufficient level in French must teach in English. There has been much talk of appeasement of lazy unilingual anglophones, which I think is completely beside the point. If an anglophone comes to school in France, it's at least in part if not in whole to learn French. However, they are ignoring other countries whose English may be better than their French, such as China or India. Partnerships and exchange programs with Chinese universities are expanded every year, and often their French is quite poor, especially when confronted with subjects like engineering. Having a few more classes available in English in French universities will certainly help facilitate the arrival of students whose level in French is insufficient to follow such classes.

Puppenkiste... so many people like it, but I think it's rather boring for everyone &gt; 13 ys.

FCA-SpVgg was an important match and nice to watch, hope your brother enjoyed a Riegele while watching!

Haha I had to google asparagus, it's ""Spargel"" in german... pretty a standard meal for this time of the year, but I like it, too. The asparagus you ate was [Schrobenhausener Spargel](http://spargel.de/schrobenhausener-spargel-gga/). The local farmers market probably was the [Bauernmarkt on the Stadtmarkt Augsburg](http://www.stadtmarktaugsburg.de/index.php?seite=bauernmarkt)

I'm glad you had a nice experience here. German people, especially Bavarians, which are not from Augsburg, tend to see Augsburg as a ""worker's town"" with lower income and not much work - hidden in the shadow of munich.
I like munich, but I think this is unfair. In fact, Augsburg is the 2nd or 3rd oldest city in germany, founded as Augusta Vindelicorum by the romans. It was/is also the home of the [Fuggers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Fugger), which were one of the richest families in world history. In fact, Anton Fugger der Ältere had so much money, in today's currency he would've had over a trillion (1.000.000.000.000, ""Billion"" in german) Euros.

So, for a long time, the [Freie Reichsstadt Augsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_imperial_city) was one of the most important merchant cities throughout Europe with its great families [Fugger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugger) and [Welser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welser)

It's a bit more expensive for them to handle international calls (IIRC they need to request some information from foreign operators), but it's a tiny expense compared to the rates they've been charging thus far. Essentially it's profitable for them even without roaming charges. Otherwise we should expect them to stop handling intra-European data traffic after 2014. If you look at Europe geographically, it's not that different from the US, and the operators there seem to do just fine without roaming charges.

The companies will lose some profit by not being able to charge roaming fees, but they will make some profit because people aren't as scared to use their phones abroad. I'm not sure whether the corporations have to take a small reduction in profits or not, but this is a huge benefit for consumers! Definitely a good move by Brussels.

Edit: If the operator is selling minutes/text/data in a bundle the situation shouldn't change. Already there are different bundle sizes, and you have to pay for anything that goes over. The operators will lose something on e.g. those customers who can now more fully utilise their minutes or w/e, but they win if someone changes into a larger bundle as a result of this.

The cancellation of the Ohrid Summit is a one of a kind occurrence, and the Macedonian public opinion is divided on whether this means a defeat of the idea of regional cooperation, a defeat of the Macedonian diplomacy or that this is a way to ""save face"" as a state-host of the event after the failure to bring on the same table the presidents of every country in the region. For now, there are only speculations about what is the true reason for cancellation, but what is well known is that the cancellation for participation of the president of Albania was the turning point which led to this epilogue. This decision of the Albanian president is believed to be highly influenced by the pre-election atmosphere in Albania (nationalism always gives you a plus votes in the Balkans), although the official explanation was that the non-invitation of the president of Kosovo was the main reason for cancellation. The participation of Kosovo was the ""hot stone"" of the whole preparation before the summit, but the problem were obvious even before that, when the presidents of the two EU and NATO member-countries: Bulgaria and Greece refused the invitation. 
This meant that the message sent to the people of this region is that the head of states do not see their countries as a part of the same region, and that they will use in the future this kind of events as a opportunity to get even or get points at their own electorate. 
All in all, it's very disappointing to see that the region called South-East Europe does not exist when there is no international pressure or some kind of mediators; that there is no cooperation between the countries even if the topics are non-political and transnational (climate change etc.) 
All of the countries in this region face huge economical and social crisis but the political establishment would still find the blame at the ""neighbors"" or the so called ""higher politics"" rather than accepting the fact that the problems are best solved using the regional cooperation method. (ex. the climate changes, have a huge impact in this region)
The things are moving... but not in the direction we would like to. Serbia and Kosovo discuss in Brussels but they would not discuss in Ohrid. Bulgaria and Greece are best allies when it comes to matters regarding Macedonia, but they would not like to be a european example for cooperation. Croatia would soon enter EU, and we should expect cooling of her relations with the rest of the ""Byzantium"" region (to paraphrase a recent statement of the Croatian prime minister).",0,1369914225,null,0,false,0,ca8qqca,t3_1fadq4,t1_ca8qqca,t3_1fadq4,null,1430985722,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Intra-European traffic is profitable for operators even without roaming charges, so this won't cause them to cease the service.

Losing the roaming charges is effectively a lump-sum tax for the operators that they can't avoid so there is no economic distortion. If you're saying that they'd increase prices on all calls/minutes/data to make more profit, the question is why aren't they already doing this? They have to maximise [volume of usage x profit margin per use], and usage goes down whenever they hike prices in real income (inflation adjusted) terms. Because they can't increase profits by price hikes now, they can't do so after losing the roaming charges either. 

If your reply is that they're already hiking prices beyond inflation as much as they can get away with due to various excuses, then that means they'd do this in any case because consumers are putting up with it. Eventually they'll stop when they've maximised [volume of usage x profit margin per use], but this is unrelated to the roaming charges question.

We don't do that ""Maybe, &lt;something&gt;"" that often. It sounds weird.

""Sie"" in the formal meaning of ""du"" is always capitalised. Though, you say ""du"" on the internet. 

""Sprache"" means ""language"", ""sprechen"" means ""to speak, to talk"".

""im"" means ""in dem"". You either speak German (Ich spreche Deutsch), you speak ""on German"" (Ich spreche mit dir auf Deutsch) or something means something in the German (language) (""car"" means ""das Auto"" im Deutschen).

""Ich bin lernt"" I suppose you wanted to say ""I'm learning"". There is no continuous form. You say ""I learn right now"" but it's not obvious what you're learning since ""lernen"" also means ""to study (for an exam)"".

Definitely. Reparations for survivors will soon become a non-issue though, since there simply won't be many left in the near future. (After all the Holocaust has happened almost 70 years ago). - So we're not really talking about ""eternal debts"" here.

""Traditional"" reparations (i.e. money to governments like after WWI) are a whole other issue. Especially when demands for them, like recently in the case of Greece, arise as an easy source of money and/or out of anti-German sentiments. 

Let's also not forget that the GDR, for example, provided the highest known reparations of the 20th century - by the first half of the 20th century. And that the *Allies* consciously decided to keep reparations/dismantlings to a minimum to ensure a stable post-war Germany/Europe. If anybody is to blame here, I think, it would be the Allies who designed the payments (or non-payments) of reparations (in all its different forms) to suit their own interests, and subsequently ""forgot"" about nations like Greece etc.
