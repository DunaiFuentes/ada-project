Yes, there is some problem with that here but far from the situation what the article wrote. I chuckled on the ""neo-nazi"" Jobbik. They are mindless radical, but fortunately not so much people agree with them. 

The main problem is the corruption and the total power what our minister want to achieve (or already had). The leading party changed the basic laws and did everything to make the next election succesful for themself.

Every single big project in Hungary is about to give money to someone who is close to the leading party. We built bridges and tunnels on flat surfaces on highways for millions of euro, renovating bridges for the price of a new one, building football stadiums to the countryside where noone wants to see football (to the home village of the minister) and the list is long. 

They spend incredible amount of money to keep rich their neightbour and the unemployment high, the prices are the same like in western europe but the salaries are much less (around €2.2/h). The hospitals are in trouble (sometimes they don't have money for sterile needles and the doctors are underpaided).

I think that is why the minor anti-semitism here because many people believes the jews are the invisible enemy behind the government who controlling them and leech the money.

i didn't, I just said it is understandable, given the context

&gt;But no, 'fix our problems' as you deny culpability.

Are you actually saying we want corrupt politicians? How easy is it for you to change your whole political class? 

&gt;That isn't racist, or hypocritical, but the antithesis of racism. It's saying it's not the fault of the people/demographic but a failure of the state that belongs to those people!

Yes it is, because your integration and accommodation treats the gypsies like they are something special, some magical species that is pitied or hated depending or your political agenda, they are people, European citizens whether you like it or not, and the problem isn't gonna be solved by passing the responsibility to a incompetent government. If moderates dance around the subject you only make your radicals more angry while not solving the problem.

&gt;Well, here's an idea. How about you get their children into schools and start treating them as equals and not a problem to pass onto someone else.

How about you treat them as citizens and give the ones that try to integrate a change and sent those INDIVIDUALS that steal to prison. 

&gt;You being the person who just said,

    ""We wouldn't have joined the EU if we could have 
     fixed our problems,"" 

Just saying what the popular reasoning behind the European integration was for easterners.

&gt;You sound like an abusive husband telling a well intentioned brother-in-law who has offered sanctuary to the battered spouse, to hit her.

You didn't offer sanctuary you just sent her back to a home she doesn't want, and believe me, Romania is extremely tolerant with gipsies, in general they're the main ""contributors"" to local law enforcement so the battered wife metaphor doesn't work.

&gt;If Romania has a future it most definitely lies with the mindset of other Romanian who commented on my comment; mature - self reflecting - pragmatic. And certainly not with your ad hoc self-aggrandisement as the parochial victim with a racist taint.

I am being pragmatic just not accommodating, and the mature part was thrown out the window when I saw your arrogant tone, here comes the self-reflecting part: I apologize I don't respect your disrespectful opinions just because you have a couple of decades of democracy more than we have. You are not better than us, you just had the luck of being born with decent leaders. 

And to clear the racist part: criminals are criminals and should be prosecuted as such, acting like they are special because of their ethnic background is racist, I was advocating  a more strict legal system because gypsies only target you because they know they can get away with it, this is the simple cold pragmatic reality they are self aware, organised and do a cost benefits analysis, they should be treated as organised crime and be prosecuted acordingly. 

Our gypsies, the ones from documentaries, the ones that are still nomadic or search our land fills for food, the ones that fill our streets and orphanages, they are a social issue and should be on the agenda of our government(who is indifferent and incompetent), but these are not the gypsies that you will meet in your metro so please stop generalising.",0,1375862703,null,0,false,0,cbinmwv,t3_1jt8i4,t1_cbinmwv,t1_cbimpzw,null,1429916498,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

On a juste une dette envers les harkis et pas les autres ?

Les harkis se sont fait massacrer en Algérie, c'était à cause de leur couleur de peau ?

Les harkis sont la preuve que la vie est mieux en France. 

Et le problème du racisme n'a rien à voir avec la couleur de peau. En Algérie, c'est arabes contre kabyles, en France, Algériens contre Marocains, Marocains contre Tunisiens, Antillais contre Africains etc.

Tu fais quoi contre ce racisme là ? Tu vas blâmer qui cette fois ?

L'origine sociale se voit au premier mot prononcé. Pas besoin de regarder le visage.

&gt;Les Maghrébins ont affaire à un racisme, un vrai, basé sur la couleur de peau.

Donc il y a un vrai racisme et un faux racisme ? Le racisme sert les bourgeois en divisant les prolétaires... Et la pseudo-lutte contre le racisme à la ""SOS Racisme"" exacerbe le racisme en divisant les prolétaires encore plus. On pointe du doigt le prolo blanc contre le prolo gris contre le prolo noir.

Je n'ai jamais dit l'inverse. Qu'est-ce qui rend les français moyen moins raciste ?

Il faut rassembler les prolos contre leur ennemi commun, la bourgeoisie, et oublier le racisme, qui de toute façon s'estompe quand tu passes aux milieux sociaux plus favorisés.

* fait des déclarations sur la viande halal, 

* veut interdire le port du voile et de la kippah dans la rue, 

* demande la fin de la binationalité, mais ferait une exception pour les pays membres de l'UE car ""l'Europe est une civilisation"" (sic). C'est d'ailleurs ce que l'UPR dénonce, l'UE s'inscrit dans la vision racialiste du [Choc des Civilisations décrit par Samuel Huntington](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Clash_of_Civilizations_map.png/610px-Clash_of_Civilizations_map.png) qui oppose le monde blanc au reste du monde, qui met tous les musulmans dans le même sac par exemple

* veut remettre sur la table l'IVG

* veut remettre su la table la peine de mort

Est-ce qu'on pourrait imaginer ne serait-ce qu'une seconde De Gaulle en 1940 proposer aux Français de le rejoindre, mais à condition qu'ils soient pour ce genre de choses ? 

Non ! Il y avait avec lui dans la Résistance des personnes d'extrême-droite tout comme des communistes, qui mettent de côté temporairement leur divergences politiques pour s'unir contre ce qui menaçait de faire disparaître la France, tout comme la France est menacée de disparaître aujourd'hui.

C'est ce que propose l'UPR aux Français, de se concentrer surs les grands sujets, et c'est justement pour ça qu'on y retrouve des adhérents qui viennent de tous les partis. La sortie de l'UE est bien trop importante pour qu'on l'amalgame à des sujets secondaires comme le fait Marine Le Pen.

Si elle ne le sait pas, elle est incompétente, et si elle le sait elle est malhonnête. Dire qu'il est mécanique d'aller vers le FN pour combattre l'UMPS n'est absolument pas fondé. Ca fait 30 ans que le FN est utilisé comme un épouvantail, et si tu dis que Mitterrand n'avait pas peur d'utiliser le FN parce que ce dernier ne représentait pas de menace pour la République, ça veut forcément dire qu'il savait que le FN ne recuillerait pas de voix, et qu'au contraire les électeurs se reporteraient sur la gauche. 

Même chose quand on veut que ceux qui hésitent votent à droite tandis que la gauche est forte, on ne va pas médiatiser Le Pen. Asselineau l'a très bien expliqué dans une inteview, j'essaierai de mettre un lien si je la retrouve.

Je ne vois pas du tout comment est-ce que le temps de parole montrerait que le FN est sous représenté. Quant à la corrélation du temps de parole/nombre de voix recueillies, Asselineau ne fait que répéter ce que toutes les études américaines sur le sujet ont trouvé. S'il est méprisant envers le peuple, ça voudrait dire que ces études sont méprisantes...

Ca ne veut pas dire que les gens ne réfléchissent pas, mais comment es-ce que tu veux qu'ils comprennent ce qui se passe quand personne ne leur expique comment ça marche, qu'on interdit tout débat, et que le seul qui a le droit d'en parler, c'est le FN ?? En 2007 et avant, est-ce que le FN parlait des [divergeances de Tartget2](http://www.creditwritedowns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Target2-Net-Balance.gif), de l'explosion du système de taux de change, des zones monétaires optimales, est-ce qu'il reprennait les traités européens point par point pour expliquer qu'on ne décide plus de rien en matière de politique budgétaire, de contrôle des mouvements de capitaux ?  Qu'il ne sert à rien de se chamailler sur les politiques d'immmigration tant qu'on est dans l'UE ?

Est-ce que le FN explique que Monnet était un agent américain, que si on chante Schuman alors qu'il a voté les pleins pouvoirs à Pétain et qu'il a été frappé d'indignité nationale et d'inéligibilté à la Libération, c'est parce qu'il y a un projet politique derrière ; que le premier président de la Commission européenne Walter Hallstein n'est qu'un ancien juriste nazi qui a préparé la Nouvelle Europe sans frontières déssinée par Hitler et Mussolini, que les Etats-Unis n'ont eu qu'à recycler Hallstein à leur compte et qu'il n'a eu qu'à ressortir ses esquisses de 1938-1941 ?

A la différence de l'UPR, le FN n'est pas contre l'UE par principe. Quand JMLP était président du parti, il voulait une ""Europe des Nations"", pas sortir de l'UE. Si le discours du FN se rapproche de plus en plus d'une sortie, c'est parce que l'UPR l'oblige à être clair, ainsi que le FDG et DLR, ce qu'ils ne sont pas, et c'est pour ça qu'on voit des adhérents de ces partis rejoindrent l'UPR, parce qu'on leur dit enfin la vérité.

Would it?  Who is actually demanding economic and political integration and being held back by Britain?  Do the French want a unified European army and navy, for instance, and happy about adopting British naval tactics, and dropping their own (Britain is, after all, the only European nation with experience of naval warfare post-WW2 and it makes sense to adopt the RN's tactics even if Britain is outside the EU as we'd still have one of the largest navies on the Continent)?  Are the German, Dutch and Finnish public clamouring for Eurobonds, or unconditional transfers south?  Were the Swedes gung-ho about the FTT?  Are the Austrians and Luxembourgish on-board with the (British backed) accord on sharing bank account details to combat tax evasion?  Don't the Germans want opt-outs on Eurozone banking supervision for their Landesbanks and don't they actively try to defend their car industry, going as far as threatening a veto over diesel tax harmonisation efforts by the EU?  Haven't the Dutch government recently called time on the idea of ""ever closer union""?  Aren't the Czechs pretty skeptical of the EU as a whole?  Don't the French jealously guard what they see as ""theirs"", like incredibly wasteful farming subsidies and the whole ""travelling circus"" roundtrip to-and-from Strasbourg, to the detriment of the general welfare of the Continent?

C'est bien de penser à leur place, mais je crois qu'ils sont capables de le faire tous seuls.

&gt;Est-ce qu'on pourrait imaginer ne serait-ce qu'une seconde De Gaulle en 1940 proposer aux Français de le rejoindre, mais à condition qu'ils soient pour ce genre de choses ?

De Gaulle était pour la peine de mort et contre l'avortement. Demander l'étiquetage de la viande halal, ça ne me pose aucun problème. La double nationalité, c'est faire exactement la même chose que l'Allemagne, donc rien à voir avec ton racialisme sorti de nulle part.

Et voici une petite citation de qui on sait :

*C’est très bien qu’il y ait des Français jaunes, des Français noirs, des Français bruns.
Ils montrent que la France est ouverte à toutes les races et qu’elle a une vocation universelle. Mais à condition qu’ils restent une petite minorité. Sinon, la France ne serait plus la France . Nous sommes quand même avant tout un peuple européen de race blanche, de culture grecque et latine et de religion chrétienne.*

&gt;C'est ce que propose l'UPR aux Français

L'UPR propose surtout de combattre le FN d'après ce que tu montres par tes interventions. C'est assez loin du rassemblement des patriotes.

&gt;La sortie de l'UE est bien trop importante pour qu'on l'amalgame à des sujets secondaires comme le fait Marine Le Pen.

Donc on ne doit pas parler de l'identité française et des problèmes liés à l'immigration ? Ces sujets sont secondaires pour toi ?

Ce sont pour moi différentes facettes des mêmes attaques que subit la France. On l'attaque économiquement, mais aussi culturellement et démographiquement en lui imposant une immigration dont elle n'a pas besoin et dont elle ne veut pas. Mais ça, Asselineau est trop loin du peuple pour le remarquer.

&gt;ça veut forcément dire qu'il savait que le FN ne recuillerait pas de voix, et qu'au contraire les électeurs se reporteraient sur la gauche.

Absolument pas. D'une part ton lien logique relève de la prestidigitation. D'autre part ça veut dire exactement ce que ça veut dire : le FN, même au pouvoir, ne représente pas une menace pour la République. La stratégie du PS, déjà expliquée mille fois, était d'abandonner les prolétaires blancs qui votaient PCF, pour prendre les immigrés alors que parmi ces derniers, les petits commerçants votaient majoritairement RPR, et les ouvriers PCF.

Le PS savait que les ouvriers blancs se reporteraient sur le FN, il a décidé de les abandonner.

&gt;Dire qu'il est mécanique d'aller vers le FN pour combattre l'UMPS n'est absolument pas fondé

Il faut faire perdre les autres, et vite. Le FN est patriote, il a déjà été au second tour, il a été constant dans son opposition à l'Europe et dans son souci d'indépendance de la France. On est loin des accusations fantaisistes de Asselineau. Ce dernier devrait concentrer ses attaques contre les puissants.

&gt;Je ne vois pas du tout comment est-ce que le temps de parole montrerait que le FN est sous représenté.

Problème de lunettes ? Nicolas Sarkozy et François Hollande se partagent 70% du temps de manière égale alors qu'ils n'ont récolté que 56% des voix. Les autres ne se partagent que les miettes sans aucun rapport avec leur représentativité.

&gt;S'il est méprisant envers le peuple, ça voudrait dire que ces études sont méprisantes...

C'est bien ce que je dis, Asselineau méprise le peuple comme tout bon énarque qui se respecte. Il fait plus confiance à des études américaines qu'à la réflexion de millions de Françaises et Français.

&gt;le seul qui a le droit d'en parler, c'est le FN ?

Ah donc en fait c'est ça le problème, un petit problème de jalousie ? L'immigration, maintenant la droite en parle. Le protectionnisme, la gauche en parle. Sortir de l'euro, tous les députés savent que ça va arriver de toute façon. Mélenchon commence à en parler. Dupont-Aignan en parle depuis toujours. Il faut donc continuer d'en parler au lieu de jalouser le FN.

&gt;En 2007 et avant [...] Quand JMLP était président du parti, il voulait une ""Europe des Nations"", pas sortir de l'UE

Pour rappel, la première proposition du [programme de Jean-Marie Le Pen en 2007](http://presidentielle2007.votons.info/2007/election-presidentielle/propositions/europe/96/le-pen/33) est de **sortir de l'Union Européenne**. C'est écrit en noir sur blanc.

Linguists call varieties of language dialects if the speakers can understand each other and languages if they can't.

In Mannheim weint man zweimal, Wenn es einen hierher verschlägt, In Mannheim weint man zweimal: Einmal, wenn man kommt, und einmal, wenn man geht

It roughly translates to: 

You cry twice in Mannheim, If you end up there
You cry twice in Mannheim, When you arrive and once you leave.

Pretty much sums up my experience (went to the uni there for 3 years). It indeed is a pretty ugly city, typical working class city I would say. High unemployment Rather poor and a lot of non germans living there. But..

- Like in every major german city public transportation is great. no car needed. You dont have to live in the city center at all to get everywhere you want as long as it is close to a station. (As somebody already mentioned, pretty much no controls whatshowever in the ""Tram"") For travel in between cities ""Mitfahrgelegenheit"" is great and pretty well used especially by students. Also new bus lines are challenging the ""Deutsche Bahn"" right now and are rather cheap too.

- There are a lot of students. Mannheim has a big (and beautiful) university, the FH Mannheim and the DHBW. so roughly about 25.000 students. A lot of them are also internationals. Closeby heidelberg is also known a a students-city

- I'd say going out in Mannheim is not as good as in other german cities comparable in size like Nuremberg for example. You do have a couple nice small clubs though but it still kinda depends on what music you're into. Can be expensive too. If you're more of a bar kinda guy i believe nearby Heidelberg is the place to go. ""Untere Straße"" in Heidelberg is pretty nice in that regard. You can even go there by Tram, kinda takes forever though. 

- A LOT of english speaking people because: There was a big army camp in the city of Mannheim, well still is but not too many soldiers left. Mannheim has the biggest John Deere plant outside of the US. Plus the above mentioned int. students.

- A lot of parks and green strips. Also chilling out on the grass by the Neckar is really neat. Its def the thing to do in the summer.

As for getting to know ppl. sports are always a good idea. There a also a lot of parties organised by students that you can attend despite not studying there. I believe your coworkers can help you out here though. For the getting around part the mentioned cities are def worth a trip. Be sure to include Nuremberg there. ;) Its a really nice city with an interesting historical background. (Be sure to check out the ""Reichsparteitagsgelände"" too.) I believe one of the above mentioned busses will take you there and back for only 25€. You can check that out on http://meinfernbus.de/ though. Definitely should pay Cologne and Hamburg a visit. Cologne of course during ""Karneval"" Hamburg is great all year round. ;)

I hope you'll have a great start in Mannheim and maybe shed a little tear when its time to leave. ;)

* A clear political framework where you can know what public has a competence.
* Transparency: the accounts of the parties, workers unions, business unions, private companies should be public.
* A better elite selection system. Maybe we should regulate the organization of the political parties and change to a electoral law without closed lists(but Italy did that and they keep the old politicians

&gt;All in all, it's difficult to guess what might be, but I'd say that our politics would be less liberal (as in more towards socialistic ideas, not as in less free/democratic) and a lot of the huge reforms done in the 90s would've been more difficult to push through.

Russia's political developments in the 90s suggested that people were overwhelmingly in support of democratic and liberal parties, and communists stood no chance. The questionable actions of said parties, however, led to people's complete disillusionment, which resulted in Russia re-sculpting itself to an authoritarian image. What I'm saying is, people were really unlikely to want to return to a pre-collapse state.

&gt;Seeing how many people objected to the idea of giving non-Estonians citizenship by default, if that would've happened, we might have had much more conflict between these groups than we did.

Again, how could there have been more conflict and dislike than there already was? The suggestion that marginalising and antagonising 30% of the population is done in the name of mitigating conflict just doesn't seem rational to me. Like I said, integration before 2007 was accelerating *despite* initial differences.

&gt;Furthermore, I wouldn't say the choices were driven by hate, but by fear 

Hate and fear then, since two tend to be completely intertwined. Listen, you don't have to sugar-coat it for me, I lived in the country.

&gt;fear that with such big representation of citizens that might be more loyal to their country of origin, we would lose much of our sovereignty to a hostile power.

Yes, but wasn't that sovereignty ensured even further, again, by not granting citizenships?

&gt;PS: Ethnic-Russians in Estonia actually emigrate as much, if not more than Estonians

Well that's great then. Personally, I know quite a few young people who emigrated without a second thought to greener pastures in Europe. They are now promising young specialists with no sentimental attachments to their country of birth. That's an astounding amount of brain-leak and tax money for a country as small as Estonia.

&gt;Also the older generation, who refuses to/cannot learn Estonian, is slowly passing away, and the younger generations continue to mix with the natives more and more in all but the most Russianized areas. The % of the population who, as you say, lack certain essential rights, is already around 8%, and it's lessening.

I can find no greater encapsulation of the Estonian attitude towards this problem than the above statement. Pretend the issue doesn't exist, and quietly hope the people will just die off. The unwillingness to take rational and decisive steps towards solving the problem also denies that grain of rationality to the image of the Russians: it is as if they absolutely do not want to also live peacefully in the country, do business and grow their children unhindered. Simply providing some quality, free-of-charge language courses on a national basis would have alleviated so much, but that just isn't a worthwhile investment, is it?

It all saddens me, of course, although I feel that this is nothing more than late ranting: history was allowed to run its' course as it did, and the damage has been done.

That's a gross oversimplification. Romania was arguably one of the more progressive Eastern Bloc countries during the late sixties and seventies. Nobody seems to remember that during the early part of Ceausescu's regime he was popular not only at home but also in the West. He eased restrictions on free speech, pursued an independent foreign policy and openly challenged Moscow's authority. He was the only leader in the Eastern Bloc who not only refused to take part in but also openly criticised the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia. 

These reforms would all be undone after Ceausescu's visit to China. Romania became increasingly more totalitarian to the point where by 1989 it had become the worst communist regime in the Eastern Bloc. The standard of living also dropped sharply during the 80's because of Ceausescu's desire to pay off Romania's foreign debt. 

&gt;If it was not for the EU mercy cashflow to you, it would have taken a century to erase all the vestiges of Ceausescu.

What do you mean by that?

&gt;How much do I know about Romania? You mean between the fact that you guys have vacillated between 4 different systems of state in less than 100 years

Just two, sorry.

Maybe because mostly I'm not arguing for my views, but rather trying to explain the views of the ""other side"", or in this case, most Estonians.


Look, it is this simple (again, not necessarily my opinion): the vast majority of Estonians in '92 wanted to re-establish the Estonia that was occupied in 1940 - a mostly homogeneous country where practically everyone spoke Estonian, and the main purpose of which was the continuation of Estonian language and culture. That couldn't be done by giving 300,000 non-Estonians (who mostly didn't speak Estonian) full citizenship by default. They had to prove their knowledge in Estonian and in our customs, culture, etc. They had to assimilate or move (back) to their country of origin. Yes, that made them angry, bitter, and created tensions, but that wasn't why it was so. Yes, it didn't go as smoothly as planned, but for many Estonians then and still now, it's better than the alternative - an **officially** dual-cultured Estonia.

&gt;Simply providing some quality, free-of-charge language courses on a national basis would have alleviated so much, but that just isn't a worthwhile investment, is it?

I can't speak for the 90s, but right now the Government will reimburse your Estonian studies for €320 for every positive Estonian level exam (the standard A2-B1-B2-C1 system). A quick search showed that this is about as much courses on one level would cost you.

Of course you might say this is a one off and not indicative.  Fortunately that's why people compile reports to establish facts from cover ups.  The Romany across Europe are most segregated in Romania:
   
http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/EU-MIDIS_ROMA_EN.pdf

I could go on, but a commissioned report goes into it.

Needless to say the report states that the Romanian state is failing the Romany people; that prejudice and institutionalised discrimination are rife there needs to be more integration and accommodation. Exactly what I said before you  started making excuses and trying to cover things up:

&gt; but right now the Government will reimburse your Estonian studies for €320 for every positive Estonian level exam (the standard A2-B1-B2-C1 system). A quick search showed that this is about as much courses on one level would cost you.

See, this is far from perfect. I can't possibly judge the quality of those courses , not having taken them, but look at it from a purely financial standpoint: €320 is nothing to scoff at, half of *average* monthly wage. I imagine a lot of people who need the course are disadvantaged to begin with, so their wage will be below the figure of €700. Russian and Estonian are significantly different in grammar, so a lot of adults lack confidence in their ability to pull through.

Quality of the construction was generally shoddy, a highway had to be closed and repaired few weeks after it was opened.

It's basically like this (very short and crude version):

His wife was kind of a ""high society"" lady and has/had (not sure) some kind of financing firm. She used to funnel illegitimate, off-the-book money of the high society including people from the judicary system (which allegedly also included this minister of justice in bavaria) to offshore accounts. Her husband found out about it and convinced her to stop. 

At this point, all would've been (probably) ok but in his infinite wisdom, he decided to expose those high-society members for their illegal activities. He went to the judges but instead of the judges and prosecutors being exposed and risking possible jailtime, they decided to put him in an insane asylum.

Votare con giudizio richiede inoltre tempo per informarsi, per valutare le posizioni dei politici, seguire i lavori parlamentari, ecc. Tutte attività precluse alle classi lavoratrici, dato che esse sono impegnate a guadagnarsi da vivere lungo tutto l'arco della giornata, e non hanno quindi tempo di dedicarsi a simili frivolezze. Pertanto solo alle persone di censo dovrebbe essere consentito votare.

L'idea inoltre che anche alle donne debba essere esteso il privilegio del voto è talmente ridicola che non vi è bisogno di dilungarvisi in questa sede.

A questo punto, viste le considerazioni sopra esposte, si può concludere che non ci sia in fondo alcun bisogno di indire elezioni: gli eventuali aventi diritto sarebbero comunque persone altolocate che verosimilmente già si conoscono e si frequentano, che potrebbero risolvere discretamente tra di loro eventuali divergenze d'opinione, e non avrebbero certo bisogno di pubbliche elezioni per operare le migliori scelte per il governo del Paese.

Heck in Tudor England before the Break with Rome by King Henry VIII Catholicism bound the country together culturally. 

However, that was then and this is now. I'm not sure I feel comfortable with a church taking such a heavy role in society in present times. I guess churches have a lot of potential and that potential has not been utalised at all really in recent times.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's kind of a shame it's the church doing this. It's good that it is being done but it's kind of a bitter sweet good because it feels like this isn't the Church's job anymore and that it should be the government or something which does it.

true,cid994,lombardia,null,"Carlo Giuliani è morto come è morto Francesco Lorusso nel 77: colpito da un proiettile sparato da un carabiniere che aveva paura. I fatti sono questi.

Carlo, oggettivamente, non costituiva un pericolo per i carabinieri dentro il Defender: quando si è chinato per raccogliere l'estintore si trovava a 4-6 metri dal mezzo. Si trovava lì perchè aveva deciso, insieme a molti altri, di rispondere ad una carica *laterale* al corteo che stava passando in via Caffa. Aveva deciso di seguire la ritirata dei carabinieri perchè era alto il rischio di un'altra carica, sempre contro il lato del corteo, una volta che si fossero raggruppati. Una carica che poteva essere pericolosa, in quella via senza altri sbocchi.

Placanica, che era dentro il Defender bloccato, non ha fatto nulla per evitare quello che poi è successo. Placanica ha mirato e ha premuto il grilletto. Il primo colpo manca, il secondo lascia Giuliani a terra ferito. Ferito, perchè il suo cuore batte ancora. Qua possiamo passare giorni a parlare di come Giuliani era lì solo per fare casino; come Placanica, che era un ragazzo come Giuliani, aveva tutti i motivi per aprire il fuoco, spaventato com'era.

Per me la questione non è tanto Placanica che ha sparato. Ha avuto paura, il beneficio del dubbio glielo si può lasciare, anche se si vede benissimo come ha mirato, prima di sparare. Capita, di perdere la testa e fare scemate. Capita.

Per me il problema è un altro. Per me il problema è quello che è successo dopo.

I carabinieri che fanno cordone intorno al corpo di Giuliani come per nascondere ciò che è appena successo.

I carabinieri che si complimentano con Placanica.

Il vicequestore che accusa un manifestante che cerca solo di capire cosa è successo.

I carabinieri che inseguono quel manifestante troppo curioso per i loro gusti.

I carabinieri che pestano a sangue il primo fotografo che riprende il corpo di Giuliani.

I carabinieri che distruggono queste foto di Giuliani, ripreso subito dopo la sua morte.

Il carabiniere, anonimo, che risponde al telefono di Giuliani dicendo alla sorella che lui sta bene, che è lì di fianco a lui.

Il corpo di Giuliani che arriva con un ritardo inspiegabile all'ospedale.

La raccolta fondi di Libero, che inizia a difendere Placanica a spada tratta, chiamandolo martire dell'odio contro le forze dell'ordine.

Scajola, che non si fa problemi ad ammettere che i carabinieri avessero ordine di aprire il fuoco contro i manifestanti, se avessero provato ad entrare nella Zona Rossa.

Questa raccolta firme, per togliere alla famiglia di un ragazzo una lapide in memoria di qualcuno che è uscito di casa, un giorno di luglio, e a casa non c'è più tornato.

Faux, la Bible chrétienne se compose à la fois du nouveau ET de l'ancien testament. 

&gt;De plus aujourd'hui on ne tue plus au nom de la Bible mais en criant Allahou Akbar!

Peut être, il fut également une époque on l'on tuait volontiers les infidèles pour la gloire de Dieu. La preuve que le concept de violence religieuse n'est en aucun le propre de l'Islam. 

&gt;De même on sait très bien que la bible a été écrite de la main de longtemps après l'apparition supposée de JC doit être prie avec des pincettes. Alors qu'en Islam le Coran descend directement de Dieu et n'est donc soumis à aucune modification possible.

Faux pour l'ancien testament, vrai pour le nouveau. Tu as conscience que dire que la Bible est le fondement même de la religion catholique romaine ? Si on en croit la légende, la Bible nous vient directement de Dieu et renferme sa parole. Je suis athée donc pour moi c'est des conneries dans tous les cas mais pour un vrai croyant en théorie la Bible n'est certainement à ""prendre avec des pincettes"". 

&gt;Last but not least, l'Islam ne fait aucune distinction entre la vie sociétale, la vie privée et les dogmes religieux : toute la vie du croyant (et du non croyant) est soumise à la volonté d'Allh et aux lois coraniques (au contraire des pays dits chrétiens où il a toujours existé une séparation entre l'Eglise, la noblesse et le Tiers Etat).

C'est clair, c'est sûrement pour cela que l'on a du voter une loi de séparation de l'Eglise et de l'Etat... **en 1905 !**

Dire également que la vie en société française n'est absolument pas influencée par la religion est une mauvaise foi absolue alors que l'immense majorité de nos jours fériés sont religieux et que chaque jour du calendrier porte le nom d'un saint chrétien. 

L'Eglise du moyen âge avait également droit de prélever certains impôts et le blasphème et la sorcellerie ont longtemps été des crimes graves en France. 

Le Roi de France tenait également son pouvoir de Dieu et était considéré comme l'un des représentants de ce dernier sur Terre.

&gt;C'est cela le vrai danger de l'Islam : aucune vie possible en dehors du Coran et de la Chariah.

Also he is a long time friend of his predecessor Gyurcsány, who is even more discredited in the eyes of the wide majority of the population. The Socialists are led another longtime Gyurcsány friend Mesterházy who is small beer so to speak.
So the cause why many think that Fidesz can't be ousted next year democratically is that most of the opposition is a thoroughy discredited bunch, with politicians who lost their credibility to many people. The ruling party losts quite much of its supporters, but most of them doesn't want to vote for the left opposition either.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"I am not a fan if the Catholic Church really, but I am sure they do a lot for the poor. I am also sure that a lot of individual priest, nuns and parishes do a wonderful job.  However, there are many problems with this. They are taking the job that in my mind the state should do.  That means less trust in the state, and perhaps also, less responsibility and accountability for them. Also, if there is more influence for the Church- what does that means? Can one vote in the church - no. In fact, half the population aren't even allowed to hold any positions of importance. Furthermore, they do not even attempt to share their accounts, show accountability etc, they only see themselves as accountable for Rome and God. Also, more Catholic Church means less influence for women, they campaigning against sensible things like birth control, condoms, gay marriages, abortions.  More Catholic Church is socially a step backwards 500 years in some respects unfortunately.

true,HadoopThePeople,EURO,European Union,"&gt;How do you know?

How do I know? I've been going to church since before the fall of communism - not very often but I've been there... Priests in churches that are being built (usually they start with a small wooden church and then they start the build of the new one - the real one) talk about the funding they get. When they get more money from a private company for example, they talk about it. Most of them don't like getting money from the city hall, because then they have to put up signs saying ""this chuch has been built with the help of mayor X"". You can say: that's trusting a priest. Yeah, but they don't really need to lie about this. 

&gt; I'm talking grants (both money and free land) by local and national authorities. You can find some links for the 2009-2011 period here.

I'm not denying what they're getting. Some of it it's restitution. And from where I'm sitting, it's more correct than giving Peles Castle to King Mihai I. Damn, it wasn't his to begin with... it belonged to the Crown. But I'm the only one out there annoyed by this, so I'm not going to insist. Other stuff is gifts so that public servants will get re-elected. Giving ""gifts"" to the tax-payer out of their taxes is something that's really fucked up... because people eat it up.

Also, again... you're giving me a number (4000) without information attached. For example: does the smaller church that I talked count? Because at the end, there's only one parish, but 2 churches... It's like saying you've got 2 houses: your apartment and your tent... Also, as I said, you must account for population growth as well. It's not like we're the same population as 50 years ago. As I said, numbers like that don't mean much... Living in Paris I can tell you that the number of churches per capita doesn't mean much...

He could have done something to make it better, like fix plumbing, clean windows, you know, nothing a little elbow grease couldn't fix. Maybe even motivate the villagers to fix the hotel and the road, and get some paying guests and split the money. With that money, they could fix more stuff and get more people to stay in the hotel and the village. But, no. He decided he'll just stay there and won't bother.

Then he hears about this splendid super-duper hotel called The Ritz in another town. A hotel where everything is *already* fixed! Not only that, they have free magazines, free toilets in the lobby, crackers and candy.

There are other hotels in other towns, too. Much less ritzy, but still vastly superior to what he's used to. He could afford those hotels with some extra work. But the guy wants it all. Now. He's got no money, no education, and no motivation to fix whatever is broken. He just wants to stay in the top of the line accommodation there is.

So he decides to go to this fabled hotel. Gets there, unshaven, unkempt, smelly -- just things one can fix for free. The lobby is great, air-conditioned, restrooms smell great, and the free snacks are super tasty.

So he decides he wants a room. He can't afford it, but what the hell. In the meantime he'll just loiter around the lobby and live off of free snacks and free restrooms, free internet, free pool.

Some guests start complaining about the guy and a bunch of guys like him, too. The staff tries to accommodate both the guests and the guys, but it doesn't really work all that well. There's more and more guys coming in and all want a room. Not a room in the okay hotel down the road -- *this* one!

So, eventually, after years of loitering about, the staff decides to prevent the guys from eating free snacks, swimming in the free pool, watching TV for free, and so on. They can still wait for their room. Nobody's throwing them out on the street. But, they have to stay in a cozy room, with all amenities, like free food, TV, etc. They just can't stay in the Grand Lobby.

Ce qu'il faut bien comprendre, c'est que participer à des bals comme ça, et prendre position sur des sujets de société qui divisent les Français n'est pas logique si l'on considère réellement que la priorité est de rassembler *temporairement* les Français, **quelles que soient leur convictions**, pour faire face au danger le plus important qui est l'UE. C'est comme s'il n'y avait pas de hiérarchisation des problèmes au FN.

Est-il absolument nécessaire de prendre position sur ces sujets ces société pour pour convaincre les Français qu'il faut sortir de l'UE ? Non, et l'UPR ne le fait pas. Au point de vue immigration, Asselineau dénonce les *blue cards* qui ne sont que le copié-collé des *green cards* et qui servent à faire du brain drain dans les Pays du Sud. Non, on n'a pas a piller ces pays. Il veut d'ailleurs qu'il y ait un grand débat sur l'immigration, en se gardant de tout populisme au passage, mais après que les Français aient repris le pouvoir. Ils décideront de leur politique d'immigration ensuite.

Asselineau explique qu'il avait fait des tracts avec du bleu/blanc/rouge, les gens refusaient en disant qu'il était un facho. La France est le seul pays où le patriotisme est considéré comme une mauvaise chose, le FN a pourri cette affaire. C'est d'autant plus enquiquinant qu'on nous dit constamment qu'il faut faire comme les US, alors que s'il y a bien un pays qui est nationaliste, ce sont eux (pledge of allegiance entre beaucoup d'autres...)

&gt;Pour rappel, la première proposition du programme de Jean-Marie Le Pen en 2007 est de sortir de l'Union Européenne. 

Pourquoi est-ce que les professions de foi de [JMLP en 2007](http://www.politiquemania.com/professions-de-foi-presidentielle-2007-6-1.html) et [MLP en 2012](http://www.politiquemania.com/professions-de-foi-presidentielle-2012-3356-1.html) ne mentionnent pas la sortie de l'UE ? JMLP pouvait peut-être être pour une sortie de l'UE dans le lien que tu as fourni, dans une autre je vois qu'il veut sortir de l'UE pour faire une ""Europe des Nations""
Quoiqu'il en soit, les propos de JMLP encore plus clivants que ceux de MLP, ça n'arrange nullement les choses. 
MLP quand à elle voulait (veut?) ne veut pas une sortie unilatérale de l'euro. Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ? Pour elle, l'euro est-il une manoeuvre de vassalisation venue des Etats-Unis OUI OU NON ? [Pourquoi est-ce qu'elle ne peut pas répondre en un mot quand on lui demande si elle veut sortir de l'euro ?](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xx4agw_l-europe-stop-ou-encore-marine-lepen-ne-veut-pas-sortir-de-l-ue_news)

&gt;Il faut faire perdre les autres, et vite. Le FN est patriote, il a déjà été au second tour, il a été constant dans son opposition à l'Europe et dans son souci d'indépendance de la France. On est loin des accusations fantaisistes de Asselineau. Ce dernier devrait concentrer ses attaques contre les puissants.

Le FN a été au second tour où il a été rejeté par 80% des Français, Maître Capello. En attendant, le résultat du FN est qu'il tourne autour des 20%. S'il était vraiment contre l'UE et pour l'indépendance de la France, il arrêterait de parler du sujets clivants et expliquerait que le projet est piloté en sous-mains par les US depuis le début, et qu'on devient le jouet d'intérêts géostratégiques décidés à Washington.

Asselineau s'oppose au puissants 99% du temps dans ses conférences puisqu'il sont pour l'Europe. Il essaye juste d'éviter que les Français tombent dans le piège dе ""l'autre Europe"" proposée par tous les partis politiques français, notamment les ""souverainistes"" du RPR etc. C'est pas pour rien que l'UPR a été crééе.

&gt;C'est bien de penser à leur place, mais je crois qu'ils sont capables de le faire tous seuls.
&gt;C'est bien ce que je dis, Asselineau méprise le peuple comme tout bon énarque qui se respecte. Il fait plus confiance à des études américaines qu'à la réflexion de millions de Françaises et Français.

Oh, il y a des Français qui comprennent ce qui se passe, je ne dis pas le contraire. Qu'en est-il de l'immense majorité ? 
Asselineau explique justement qu'on est dans un nouveau type de guerre, qui vise à reprogrammer le logiciel qu'on a dans le cerveau, c'est une véritable saloperie. Il n'y a plus de chars dans la rue ou de bombes larguées, c'est bon pour la périphérie de l'Empire ça.

Non, pour les français, t'as Koh-Lanta, de la musique américaine et des séries américaines à longueur de journée qui ferment les Français du monde. C'est une dictature qui s'impose par ça, puis la complexité et l'ennui. Qui a envie de parler des traités européens en plein été ? L'immense majorité des gens décrochent au bout de quelques minutes. Si une majorité des Français n'étaient pas victimes de propagande du berceau à la tombe comme quoi l'Europe c'est la paix, l'euro c'est le prospérité, le bonheur et le le plein-emploi, et si on arrêtait de leur dire qu'ils devraient avoir honte de dire le contraire parce que ça signifierait qu'ils sont FN donc extrêmistes, on serait déjà en dehors de l'UE et en train de restaurer notre image dans le monde. 

Ca n'est pas le cas, les médias verrouillent le système et le FN salit le combat pour la souveraineté nationale en le défendant, **mais** en prenant également position  sur des sujets clivants de manière à ce que la grande majorité des Français les rejettent.

Le pool des voteurs ne cesse que de rapetisser pour une bonne raison, c'est à cause de l'UE et  c'est aussi à cause des politiciens français. 
Je me rappelle avoir vu un sondage qui montrait que la majorité des Français estimaient que les vrais sujets n'avaient pas été abordés pendant l'élection présidentielle. On leur sert des petits débats minables pour qu'ils se disputent entre eux pendant que tous les sujets stratégiques sont complètement perdus de vue.

Les gens sont tellement dégoûtés par la scène politique française, de ce show-biz qu'ils commencent à faire de l'abstention agressive, on en est arrivé la, et la responsabilité du FN est entièrement engagée. 

&gt;rien à voir avec ton racialisme sorti de nulle part.

Au contraire, il y a tout à voir si on prend du recul. L'OTAN+UE correspond fichtrement bien au bloc judéo-chrétien du Choc des Civilisations de Samuel Huntington.  Par ailleurs, si tu grattes l'européiste convaincu , tu as très vite des gens qui sortent  le ""péril jaune"", le ""péril noir"", le ""péril indien"". On a bien vendu l'idée de l'UE aux Français pour ""faire poids"" contre les Etats-Unis et les Asiatiques, par exemple. [Cette pub pour l'UE dit tout.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyZghwIxTpM)

Ce sont les mêmes qui nous disent que les européens forment une même peuple et qu'ils devraient renoncer à la démocratie pour n'utiliser qu'une même monnaie, avoir la même politique budgétaire, sociale, en matière d'immigration, d'affaire étrangères, militaires etc. Non, la France ne se limite pas à ça malgré ses traditions. En voilà une autre citation puisqu'on en parle : *La France est pour la paix, il lui fait la paix. La France, pour renaître vraiment,  pour se refaire, et pour s'étendre, au sens le plus noble du terme, il lui faut la paix. Par conséquent, la France cherche la paix, cultive la paix, aide la paix partout. Comment ? en étant en rapport avec tout le monde. Il n'y a aucune espèce de raison pour que nous excluons d'avoir de bon rapports avec ceux-ci ou avec ceux-là.""*


L'UE est complètement subordonnée à l'OTAN par les traités européens. Ce bloc judéo-chrétien ose dire que l'Europe c'est la Paix, mais l'OTAN et les États-Unis désormais imposent tout simplement la ""volonté"" de la ""race blanche"", violent le droit international en mentant des guerres néocoloniales en Afghanistan ,émiettent les régimes, qui ne sont certes pas des modèles de démocratie on est d'accord, mais qui étaient laïques, calqués sur la France d'ailleurs, pour les transformer en foyers de purulence où règnent les chefs de guerre et l'extrémisme religieux en Irak, en Lybie, en Syrie. 

Conformément à la pensée de Zbigniew Brzezinski décrite dans son livre Le Grand Echiquier, ils essayent d'encercler la Russie, on le voit avec les pays baltes qui ont rejoint l'OTAN et l'UE, l'éclatement de la Serbie à partir duquel ils ont créé le Kosovo et installé un de leur plus importante bases militaires, les révolutions au financement douteux en Ukraine, les révolutions ""de couleur"" en Asie centrale, etc. C'est pour ça que la Turquie rentrera dans l'UE, parce que les Américains l'ont décidé, puis ça sera le tour de l'Ukraine, des pays d'ex-Yougslaovie, puis des pays de l'Oural si l'UE n'explose pas avant.

Si la presse dit tellement du bien du Dalai-Lama ([et ne mentionne pas ses amitiés avec des Nazis, la CIA et des sectes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLx5YvQOZCA)) c'est parce que si les US s'installent au Tibet  (où 11 fleuves prennent leur source, dont le Fleuve Bleu et le Fleuve Jaune, bien évidemment d'une importance considérable pour la Chine), ils obtiendront un avantage balistique considérable s'ils y installent des missiles à 5 km d'altitude, qui leur permettront de surveiller la Chine, le plateau indo-gangétique. Certes, il y a eu une tentative de sinisation forcée au Tibet, mais j'imagine que les Français le savent puisqu'on ne cesse de le leur répéter. Les objectifs géostratégiques par contre c'est motus. Les intérêts américains qui veulent maintenir à tout prix leur ""glacis"" géopolitique construit depuis la fin de la Second Guerre mondiale, ça le FN n'en parle pas ,et s'ils commencent à en parler, tu sauras d'où ça vient.

In ogni caso non stiamo parlando di chi avesse elaborato la migliore tattica su un campo di battaglia: perché quel giorno non era in programma (sicuramente non nel corteo delle tute bianche) una guerriglia con le f.o.: è ovvio che i manifestanti reagirono senza potersi coordinare: romanticamente, se vuoi metterla così.

Plenty of them. R&amp;D budgets for these companies pale in comparison to their advertising budgets. And most medical research and progress occurs because of grants, donations, public funding, etc, not by for profit drug companies. Also, releasing the drug information to the world would allow anyone to take the research and ""run with it"" so to speak. This would greatly increase the number of people working on research for a given technology, because the information would be freely available, not jealously guarded by one greedy elite company.

They (or at least their major political parties) claim that they want autonomy for the region. I fully support this; it is justified by the considerable cultural difference.

In fact, I would really like the whole country to become a federation, so that historical regions such as Transylvania, Moldova and others wouldn't have to depend so much on Bucharest. At least for Transylvania, we know that it's really bad as it is right now since most of our tax money and resources go to Bucharest for them to distribute them to poorer regions; Romania has a very anachronically centralized system that could have been understandable a few decades ago, but now is simply counterproductive.

I don't think I would fully support the complete secession of Székelyföld, but it's not for me to decide. Frankly, I don't think the inhabitants of these regions really want complete secession though, but their demands for greater autonomy have always been argued against by the Romanian nationalists saying ""they wand to secede!"" and other nonsense like this.

What I find amusing is that even though the perception of nationality here (as in most other Eastern European countries) is strongly tied to ethnicity, most Romanians will also tell you that the region I've talked about is Romanian land, so how ""could you even demand autonomy?!""

Oh dear, another yank who thinks Europe is run by an evil Muslim agenda. I must ask, have you ever even been to Europe? As the Muslim ""problem"" is pretty minor in Europe in comparison to say, Roma gypsys. 

In Ireland and most of the UK, Muslims are pretty well integrated. The same can be said for most of the continent, France being an exception as it has had problems with integration since the late 70's and a lot of it is down to bad planning and policies. In Germany there are many turks who settle and enjoy a happy, integrated life despite what the internet would tell you. The long road to tolerance in the old Yugoslavia is being taken, as the European Union being a target to aim at, a long way from ethnic warfare less than thirty years ago. Scandinavia is also well integrated despite riots in Sweden this year, which was just scumbags causing trouble who happened to be Muslim.

The Muslim violence the news mentions isn't due to them being Muslim, its due to the same reason scumbags cause trouble in the likes of r

Yep. In terms of intensity, it stands midway between Cornwall and Catalonia. 

&gt;If so, do you support it?

I do, for practical and personal reasons. Practical reasons would be that smaller countries are easier to govern, a small population usually comes along with a better and more representative democracy, we can adapt easier to new situations, the economy works better if the politicians are not an elite which never sets a foot outside of Paris except for smiling to the camera.  
Personal and emotional reasons are protection of our identity, reintroduction of breton alongside french as our language (we have two heritages, latin and celtic), the fact that I love complicated geopolitics and a clusterfuck of little political entities like Europe much more than big federal states like in north America, the possibility to set the bases for a new country.

You see the problem in Italy is that there is literally nobody to vote for. It's ridiculous.

And then you have the person who isn't even a real candidate anymore and that is the former PM Mario Monti. People won't vote for him, and I understand them. His economy plans are too harsh. He is probably the one who will fix the economy in the best way but it's just too harsh.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"Russia is weak now. But that really means Russia is weak compared to its heights in the Soviet Union. A weak Russia is still a very powerful country.

&gt;If we ended up in a skirmish with them it wouldn't be anything that we couldn't handle.

What makes you think that? I know Russia's military has aged, but it is still capable. How many western armies must be destroyed before we get it through our heads that no matter how weak Russia appears on paper, it is still a force to be reckoned with. Underestimating Russian resolve has sent people to their graves by the millions. I don't want to test that out again.

&gt;and it should the goal of the U.S. to keep them weak.

Maybe. Many people would agree with you, and certainly contemporary geopolitical strategies in the west aim to do just that. But what if it is beyond our abilities to prevent them from getting stronger? Can we do this? What right do we have to keep Russia weak? If we pursue this strategy, and Russia does become the powerful country it once was, how will they behave after a few decades of the west holding them down? Is it better to just let them grow organically and not try to prevent their rise? I think they will become powerful again one way or another. And if/when they do, will that strategy of containing Russia blow up in our faces when they are truly free to flex their muscles?

I think this is just a tricky situation all around. It is certainly beyond my depth to calculate all the ""what-if"" scenarios. I go back to my original (and most likely unpopular point). There is no point in angering Russia. We will have to deal with it one way or another. I would rather deal with a Russia that wasn't angry at the west for decades of trying to keep it weak, which it views as nothing less than total humiliation. The Russians don't like being humiliated, so why do it.

I definitely agree. Despite the US bringing much of the capability to the table, obviously all members have a say. The intervention in Libya is a perfect example of this. Everyone voted for intervention, yet few participated, and the ones that did needed US support even after the US eliminated Libya's anti-aircraft capabilities. 

I can see how it may be in the interest of European NATO members to expand NATO's presence to counter Russia's influence. Unfortunately for the US (and probably Canada) they would likely simply be out voted. The main recourse would be for the US to withdraw, which is still pretty unlikely.

I don't think you can call the issues that the US is having as peanuts.  

Even if you set aside the more grievous abuses like Guantanamo, torture, rendition and other abuses, you still have a state with serious issues.

The US holds more prisoners than any other (absolutely and pro-capita), those it holds it holds in conditions that most states you'd want to compare the US too would deem utterly unacceptable. The justice system feeds that, there is what can only be seen as illegitimate pressure to force people into accepting guilty pleas through bargaining, again, something unknown outside of the US.   Outside of the prison system, the US kills vast numbers of people in its normal day to day policing (and has some serious issues with police violence - not just anecdotally, but when you look at 'legitimate incident' statistics.  Then you have the minor issues of mass domestic surveillance that are only now coming to light, and the use of that for internal policing.

That's the tip of the iceberg, you see serious harassment of political activists, albeit usually in a way that isn't overtly political (you won't see people arrested for their political activities directly, but for their activities - activities that again, in most places would be legitimate). 

Now yes, Russia also treats dissidents very badly (quite often far worse) and its prisons are a state, not to mention that its brand of political oppression is somewhat more direct, but the ends aren't that different.  

The same applies to the US and Russian media, on the surface both are free to do as they please and hold government to account, in the US this fails because of a lack of regulation on ownership and government starting to play a role in what 'legitimacy' of media actually means (and through the simple expedient of using external means to harm media orgs - like wikileaks). It also uses access restrictions to control reporting.  Russia takes a more direct approach (not quite as direct as the whole attacking Al-Jazeera abroad, but I suppose we should focus on the domestic) and that seems to include threatening the lives of and possibly taking the lives of journalists, but the result is again the same - there is some criticism, but nothing overtly threatening to the state as a whole.

The US isn't Russia, the approaches are different, and I don't think that the US could be accurately described as a police state or outright oppressive, but it isn't that far off either.  It certainly isn't free - the classic argument is that the US protects individual freedoms in name, but then fails to actually ensure they are freedoms that can be used if their use conflicts with government (at all levels..).

The US also has a lot of localised issues that in Russia would probably be replaced by something more akin to corruption - police forces and elected policing elements using their powers in ways that are striking for their illegitimacy...

So yeah, not the same, but damn, the problems that the US has are pretty massive and very serious.  I'm sure for the average person it wouldn't have much of an impact, but I certainly wouldn't want to be an activist on the wrong side of the government in either Russia or the US.",0,1375912080,null,0,false,0,cbj2dv2,t3_1jw3sz,t1_cbj2dv2,t1_cbizxhw,null,1429909587,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

Undoubtedly it is, but I don't think the goal of the US and its allies would be to march ground troops into Moscow, and crush it. I imagine it would be more of a war of containment- and ejection of Russia from the Baltics- which would be much easier to accomplish with our superior technology. 

In the past decade Russia has began to reassert itself against the West, and there's no reason to believe that they won't become even more belligerent towards us if they become more powerful. When the Russian elite decides they want to be partners with the West, then I think the US and the EU would be much more accommodating to their rise. But right now they're a profoundly undemocratic ""democracy,"" and they actively support despots, and peruse policies that run counter to the to the vital interests of both the US and Europe.

Also, because referendums depend so much on the extremely volatile whims of public opinion, and on who chooses what question to ask, and when to ask it.

If we want an example which avoids the Weimar Republic and Godwin's Law, look at the ongoing clusterfuck in California. Many referendum propositions are sponsored by billionaires and corporations. The electorate simultaneously vote through mandatory budget cuts and new mandatory spending requirements, which mean that basic services have to be cut, and the state teeters on the edge of bankruptcy. They have also introduced the three-strikes law, which have regularly handed out life-sentences for minor crimes like shoplifting. Huge percentages of the population sit in for-profit jails, where inmates are forced to work for free.

How about the Russian police using an unknown nerve agent to ""clear"" a hostage situation (the gas killed more people than the kidnappers). Or the school takeover. Negotiate? Fuck no, we're going in shooting. Ended with a bunch of kids dead.

Both of those amount to massive police over-reach, they are awful I'll grant you, but its not as if the US doesn't massively over-reach with its policing on a massively regular basis either.  Its just that they are usually deemed legitimate (even when they wouldn't be almost anywhere else, bar possibly places like Russia..).  That's sort of the point, the US also use firearms excessively, massively so and questionable levels of force by the police.

&gt;You want to talk corruption? It's commonplace to be stopped in Russia by the Militsiya with the options of either bribing them or spending the night in jail.

And its apparently commonplace in parts of the US to have property seized without cause, money that ends up going into the police departments coffers.  Again, its not like for like, both countries have serious problems.

&gt;Treating dissidents badly? They get assassinated in Russia if they annoy the establishment too badly. Example: Anna Politkovskaya

Yup, and again, there are lists (some that should taken with an *extremely* large grain of salt) that suggest quite a few US political assassination on US soil, especially of investigative journalists.  

The thing that strikes me is that there are enough horror stories about the US and Russia, that it should give anyone pause.  I don't doubt for a minute that living in the US would be better for most people than living in Russia, but damn, there is a hell of a lot more going on in terms of human rights abuses than either side would let on.  

Its the huge abuses that are really problematic though, the mass spying (whether high tech as in the US, or lower tech in Russia), the casual violence from those representing authority and the often broad acceptance of both that is truly problematic.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; I always come away thinking that the Russian threat is exagerrated. And that the idea that Russia is actively trying to, or would desire to, rule over large swathes of Europe again is also exaggerated. I know it is me who is full of shit when it comes to that opinion, but I just cannot really get fully convinced that Russia is the evil entity it is made out to be.

I think there's a logical leap in your interpretation. Russia does not seek influence or control over its neighbors because it is evil. It does so because it is afraid. The Russian leadership, ever since the Grand Principality of Muscovy united the Russians under one banner, has operated in a world without walls, and that is a very scary place to be.

Russia is a steppe. It has no natural barriers. Britain has a moat; France has the Pyrenees and the Alps to guard its flanks; even Poland has the Carpathians to back up against and the Pripyat and the Pomeranian lakes to guide entrance to Polish heartland. Russia has nothing. It has no natural barriers; the ethnic Russian heartland has ethnic minorities between it and the most convenient natural walls: the Urals, the Baltic, the Caucasus. In order for Russian leaders to feel secure that the Russian heartland is protected, they have to *know* that those ethnic minorities are under their control or at least sufficiently influenced by the Russians to refuse any alliance with Russia's enemies.

Under the tsar, these minority-filled territories were directly annexed to the Empire. Under the Soviets, the smallest were annexed to the empire, while others like Poland and Romania were subjugated by Russian-friendly collaborators. When the Soviets collapsed, Russia was too weak to prevent all but the smallest and weakest from freeing themselves from the Russian sphere of influence. Russia sees this freedom from Russian influence as not only threatening, but temporary.

Centuries of Russian foreign policy have not been based on the intrinsic evil of Russian leaders. That foreign policy was based on deep fear and insecurity. That insecurity has not disappeared. Geography motivates the Russian desire to control the non-Russians who surround them as much as it allows the Swedes or British to leave the Continent alone and intervene only when one power comes too close to dominating it.",0,1375918871,null,0,false,0,cbj4uay,t3_1jw2t8,t1_cbj4uay,t1_cbj2dg9,null,1429908441,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

Ah! Mais c'est sans compter le livre blanc 2013 de la défense que tu semble oublier dans ta narrative ! Le livre blanc 2013 se trouve dans la continuité de celui de 2008 qui confirmait que la classe dirigeante française était en train de préparer un tournant vers la guerre afin de résoudre les contradictions matérielles qui accablent l’impérialisme mondial. 

Cet état de fait a d'ailleurs été confirmé par les diverses interventions de Sarkozy en Cote d'Ivoire et en Lybie.

L'actuel livre blanc, celui de 2013 présenté par le gouvernement PS,  présentait des projets non seulement pour continuer mais pour intensifier massivement l’agression de l’armée française outre-mer. Il précisait : ""[L’évolution du contexte stratégique pourrait amener notre pays à devoir prendre l’initiative d’opérations, ou à assumer, plus souvent que par le passé, une part substantielle des responsabilité impliquées par la conduite de l’action militaire.](http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2013/04/30/1617247-les-points-cles-du-livre-blanc-de-la-defense.html)""

En effet, il contient une liste incroyablement longue de cibles ou de cibles potentielles pour une agression militaire française. Il traite de la possibilité de nouvelles guerres en Afrique, de déploiements au Moyen-Orient et en Asie en vue de possibles conflits avec l’Iran et la Chine et de déploiements des forces nucléaires françaises.

Certes, le Livre blanc affirme un alignement de la France sur Washington. Mais cela se fait conformément au prédécesseur conservateur de Hollande, Nicolas Sarkozy, et la France n'avait de toutes façons jamais opposés de manière sincère l'impérialisme américain depuis le général De Gaulle (Parle moi de l'Irak, ose!).

Mais cette alliance est stratégique, et n'est pas juste dûe au complot atlantico-sioniste tant dénoncé par l'extrême-droite ! En effet, les français étaient confrontés a un dur choix: Rester seul et risquer de perdre son précarré colonial en Afrique, où s'allier aux Etats-Unis pour se faire faire gendarme de l'Afrique par ces derniers ?

En outre, chose qui doit te satisfaire, individu soucieux de la puissance militaire française, le document recommandait de maintenir l’armement nucléaire français, tel les programmes de sous-marin et de missiles qui coûtent près de 3,5 milliards d’euros par an. Certes, le programem serait ""strictement défensif"" mais le Livre Blanc 2013 ajoutait:
 ""Certains des moyens des forces nucléaires peuvent être utilisés pour les opérations conventionnelles sur décision du Président de la République.""

The taxes are added when the car enter the country, which means you are relying on a low base price for it to be profitable.

A lot of the taxes are old ones which the politicians havent bothered to remove, mostly because they bring in a LOT of money to the state, actually around 7,6 billion Euros per year. On the other hand only around 3 billion Euros are used on roads, and a lot of it is road tolls.

Literally right off of Gran Via where you will find tons of shopping, cafes, and restaurants (although mostly chains). And it's just a short walk right to Puerta del Sol, another touristy spot. But when you get to the heart of Malasaña, for arguments sake, say Calle San Vicente Ferrer to Plaza Dos de Mayo, there you'll find a bustling night life. Cafes, bars, dance clubs, restaurants, boutiques, grocery stores, you name it. A lot of my friends live(d) in the area and we always had our favorite local spots to go.

Another area that I enjoyed a lot was La Latina. You'll find the same stuff that you'd get in Malasaña. I think in Malasaña, it was a bit more concentrated so maybe it felt more packed, but La Latina offers a lot of great places to eat and drink. It's south of Malasaña, so you'd have to cut through Gran Via to get there, but for the most part, a 15-20 minute walk.

&gt; Prior to the German invasion, the population of Jews was estimated to be about 210,000,[2] although according to data from the Lithuanian statistics department, as of 1 January 1941 there were 208,000 Jews.[3] This estimate, based on the officially accounted for prewar emigration within the USSR (approx. 8,500), the number of escapees from Kaunas and Vilnius Ghettos, (1,500-2,000), as well as the number of the survivors in the concentration camps when they were liberated by the Red Army, (2,000-3,000), puts the number of Lithuanian Jews murdered in the Holocaust at 195,000 to 196,000.[3] It is difficult to estimate the exact number of casualties of the Holocaust and the latter number cannot be final or indisputable. The numbers given by historians differ significantly ranging from 165,000 to 254,000, the higher number probably including non-Lithuanian Jews among other Riech (empirical) dissenters labeled as Jewish killed in Lithuania.[3]


&gt; Two factors contributed to the rapid destruction of Lithuanian Jewry. The first was the significant support for the ""de-Jewification"" of Lithuania coming from the Lithuanian populace.[8][12] The second was the German plan for early colonization of Lithuania – which shared a border with German East Prussia – in accordance with their Generalplan Ost; hence the high priority given to the extermination of the relatively small Lithuanian Jewish community.[12]


&gt; The involvement of the local population and institutions, in relatively high numbers, in the destruction of Lithuanian Jewry became a defining factor of the Holocaust in Lithuania.[1][2][12]",0,1375925275,null,0,1375925940,0,cbj70rg,t3_1jw2t8,t1_cbj70rg,t1_cbj31bo,null,1429907424,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

---

I'm posting this here just because I think needs to be made public to a larger audience. Hopefully, with enough attention, this will lead to a change in behavior among the involved mods... but I'd be surprised if it did. 

First, some background information: Gibraltar is a disputed British Overseas Territory located on next to Spain. Currently, there's a row between Spain and Gibraltar over some ""artificial reef"" that they've placed in the waters off Gibraltar, to stop Spanish fishing vessels. Yesterday, in /r/europe/ [I expressed my opinion on it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jsb7c/spain_must_follow_eu_law_on_gibraltar_border/cbhti5l) What you also need to know is that this sub is run by at least five British mods... 

It started off with me saying that the people of Gibraltar are not without blame for the current situation. As you could imagine, this was not very popular with the British. Some of them agot mad, and I got downvoted. (Fair enough.) 

Fast forward to today, and another post about Gibraltar appears. I express my amazement over the fact that the British people are keen to defend the people of Gibraltar, even though they are basically self-exiled Brits, that only moved there to avoid British taxes. (That is by the way not a completely uncommon view, even among the British.) I also [repeated my opinion](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jv092/gibraltarspain_border_britain_makes_formal/cbillrc?context=3) that some of the Spanish ire was caused by the actions of the Gibraltarians. 

This prompted a reply from /u/Salvaxe/, a native Gibraltarian, accusing me of being ignorant and a troll. I'm neither of that, and said so. (Check my history!) I also threw some stones back at her. (What's good for the goose...) I've been noticing her interacting with other people before, and she can be quite abrasive and somewhat trollish. She also doesn't like Muslims. But that's apparently OK in /r/europe, and BTW, if you look at *her* history you won't see anything, because she regularly deletes all of her comments. 

Anyway, that's is what I said... and low and behold, my reply was promptly deleted by /u/TheSkyNet/ -- a British mod. For no good reason! And don't just take my word for it; one of the other few *non-British* mods agreed that my comment [shouldn't have been deleted in the first place,](http://i.imgur.com/QFGT3uFh.jpg) but said that he couldn't help me. 

So I tried to post my reply again, but it was also deleted. In fact, several posts of mine have been deleted, and several alternative accounts been banned on /r/europe/. And the only thing I did was *not* agreeing with the prevailing British opinion, and express my disbelief that I've been censored for it. Why? I mean, not even racist posts warrant that much attention from the mods in /r/europe/. 

It's too bad that the mods can get away with that sort of behavior in /r/europe/. It's a pretty shitty way to run a sub, IMO. I never thought that I would be on the reviving end of some good old mod abuse, but there you go... It can happen to anyone, and for no good reason.

That if America was invaded by a country like China, very few European countries would be able to fulfill their treaty obligation and aid us. Who would be sending a fleet of aircraft carriers? Nobody. Yet we are suppossed to defend every European citizen, even when they are right next to Russia.

But another part of me forces me to look at this situation in a different way. The way I am talking in the previous paragraph relegates countries to vassal status, and the fate of a buffer zone. Americans have money on the line, Europeans have lives on the line. Think of all the major wars in the last century. America has never we been crushed and had our homeland destroyed. War is an absract thing to us that happens in far away places. So I tend to think of NATO of being a monetary and responsability burden, where other countries would view it as a lifeline.

As another commenter already mentioned, Qatar is hosting the World Cup and with all the money the Gulf States are pouring into sports and PR, there's just bound to be more. The only difference is that Qatar or KSA are Western Allies.

Unfortunately, I can't link to any of your worst comments, because you regularly delete all of them -- just like a troll would.

They're basically digging their own grave. The younger people don't really care about religion, at least in the urban areas.

true,__juh__,null,null,"Der erste Lobbyist ruft bereits an, bevor du überhaupt richtig mit dem Wahlkampf begonnen hast. Zumindest trudeln so genannte Wahlprüfsteine von allen nur denkbaren Gruppen und Vereinigungen ein, in denen man aufgefordert wird, sich zu deren Positionen zu äußern. Das sind manchmal sehr spezielle und knifflige Fragen. 

Die meisten dieser Gruppen verfolgen ehrenwerte Ziele. Es sind Selbsthilfegruppen, Naturschutzgruppen, sozial orientierte Gruppen, aber auch Vereine jeder Art. Kurz gesagt: es gibt kaum ein Feld, auf dem es nicht die eine oder andere Interessensgruppe aka Lobby gibt. Nur der Bürger hat keine Lobby, weil er sich *als Bürger* nicht organisieren kann. 

Wenn du in einem Verein tätig bist und als Vorstand in einem Brief an alle deutschen EU-Abgeordnete diese aufforderst, z.B. gegen Softwarepatente zu stimmen (wie ich es getan habe), so hast du als Lobbyist gehandelt. Als Verein mit X Mitgliedern, die Y Angestellte beschäftigen und Z Umsatz machen, hast du einen gewissen Einfluss auf die Politiker. Als Mitglied eines solchen Vereins, hast du indirekt dann etwas bewirkt. 

Die Bürger haben aber keinen Verein. Die Parteien sollten einmal soetwas sein. Sie sollten durch Diskussion, Streit und Kompromiss in den Parlamenten die teilweise widerstreitenden Interessen der vielen Interessengruppen ausgleichen. Das funktioniert nur leider nicht. 

Ein Grundfehler m.E. ist, dass durch den Fraktionszwang die Meinungsvielfalt in den Parlamenten nicht wirksam werden kann. Es entscheiden letztlich sehr kleine Kreise im Fraktionsvorstand. Und die Lobby, die zu diesen kleinen Kreisen Zugang hat, kann ihre Positionen am besten durchdrücken. Das sind dann leider nicht mehr die Vereine und Selbsthilfegruppen, sondern die Unternehmens- und Branchenlobbys mit den dicken Geldtaschen. Würden die Abgeordneten sämtlich nur nach ihrem Gewissen (oder Gutdünken völlig egal) abstimmen, hätten diese Lobbys wesentlich weniger Einfluss. Andere Einflüsse könnten sich geltend machen und die Entscheidungen würden besser werden. 

Ein zweites Problem ist, dass Parteien als Organisationen immer auch ein Eigeninteresse und ein Eigenleben entwickeln und von außen vor allem als Organisation wahrgenommen werden. Schau dir mal die politischen Interviews genau an. Die Journalisten interessieren sich nur für den Kurswert einer Partei. Wenn ich mit einem Journalisten spreche, ist seine erste Frage nicht, was wollen die Piraten gegen Überwachung tun, sondern: Haben Sie noch Hoffnungen in den Bundestag zu kommen. Bei Steinbrück ist es genauso. Er wird vor allem gefragt, ob er glaubt, noch gewinnen zu können. Was er als Kanzler machen würde, interessiert die Journalisten nur am Rande. 

Wenn die Journalisten so drauf sind, dann muss man sich nicht wundern, dass die Parteien alles daransetzen, Prozente zu scheffeln, egal wie man den Wähler dabei verarschen muss. Das Signal der Journalisten an die Politiker ist eindeutig: Du, deine Meinung und dein Programm interessieren uns einen Scheißdreck. Wo stehen deine Aktien in den Umfragen? Und die gleichen Journalisten jammern dann aber über eine fehlende politische Diskussionslandschaft. 

Die einzigen, die sich richtig für unser Programm interessieren, sind die Bürger, die an den Infostand kommen. Und deshalb stehe ich auch gerne auf der Straße und drücke den Leuten Flyer in die Hände. Denn es kommen immer Menschen vorbei, die genau wissen wollen, wie wir zu diesem oder jenen Thema stehen. Und dann bin ich sehr froh, dass unser Programm nicht aus hohlen Phrasen besteht, sondern konkret und durchdacht ist. Von den meisten Bürgern, mit denen wir reden, bekommen wir eine positive Rückmeldung.

Was fehlt, sind Strukturen, die es dem Bürger ermöglichen, in der Politik mitzuwirken. Er meldet sich im Moment nur zu Wort, wenn er persönlich betroffen ist. Wenn ein Acker zu einem Gewerbegebiet gemacht werden soll, sprießen die Bürgerinitiativen aus seinem Boden. Wenn die Sache erledigt ist, fällt sie wieder in sich zusammen. Die Piraten fordern deshalb im Wahlprogramm (übrigens in enger Abstimmung mit dem Lobbyverein Mehr Demokratie e.V.) mehr direkte Demokratie. https://www.piratenpartei.de/politik/wahl-und-grundsatzprogramme/wahlprogramm-btw13/demokratie-wagen/ Es wäre schön, wenn es uns gelingen würde, durch mehr direkte Demokratie, eine (Achtung Schlagwort) nachhaltige Bürgerbeteiligung zu erreichen.

We also do a fair amount of international business law for investment and real estate companies. In general, traffic law, employment law and family law are the biggest bread-winners. We do almost none of that (although I do have an intriguing international employment law case at the moment).

So, our financial situation is quite good.

My immediate competition is a small firm with four lawyers. They are a full-service, all legal areas firm and do everything from contracts to criminal law. They also have enormous overhead (20 secretaries).

Beyond this, maybe 3-4 other lawyers have practices in my town. I don't ever perceive them because they are so low profile and do not really run their businesses in a professional manner. If you divide the number of people in town by the number of lawyers, you have something like 5,000+ people per lawyer, a ratio far above the federal average.

Rural areas are certainly an underserved market.

Who are they? 



&gt;
    Leaving the EU and Schengen, to protect yourselves from the consequences.
    Keep throwing money.
    Try to fix the EU and the countries.



You are making the options as if they are the only one btw. Are you saying that they are the only ones? Of course not. For example, you completely forget the option that *you* could leave Schengen and the EU, just as an example. *You*  could try to fix your countries, but you are not giving that even as an option. That is why I will not answer those first questions, you aren't even attempting to give all the options, you just say that there is a and b, and forget the rest of the alphapbet. 


You said that I should care about Spain, just as I should care about the US. Well, you refused to answer the question of who you think should fix the US. So, I ask again-  who do you think should fix the US, who do you think should fix Spain? Please answer this. And, if not the Spanish or they Americans - then who? And why? 


&gt;What do you expect me to do?

I don't know, it is your country - you fix it. I am not an expert of all the worlds countries, what do you think the Malwians should do? I know stuff I want changed in Sweden, and I do try to change them to, at least some of them. But, I do not expect a Spanish person to be expert on my country, so why should I be an expert on your country? Again - you are putting the resonsibility of the solutions on me, on people outside of Spain. The responsibility lies inside Spain, of course. 


&gt;What do you think that the rest of the EU should do?

Not a lot. The Spanish economy is not the EU's responsibility, and *any* solution would involve going beyond the commitments that the EU states have made. I think it is extremely important that the EU honours its rules and regulations, and getting involved in the internal affairs of a sovereign state is breaking the EU rules in so many ways it is not even funny. Nor is it what anyone has voted for, in the Maastricht treaty. It wasn't -"" hey, lets have the treaty and we will follow it (which they haven't, but a whole different discussion) but now Spain is going bust, so now we are going to say that Spain is not a sovereign state anymore, and the Spanish people do not know what to do and are asking other people to fix them, which, will as we know, all involve money, loads of them. Please Finland, give them 5 % of your GDP"". 

Again - you do not seem to realise. You are a sovereign state. It is not in the EU statue that we should come in a fix you. 

Buit, for the record, I think the Euro is the most imperfect of currencies and that you should leave it, together with Greece and Portugal. What Spain is suffering from (a huge part of the problem at least) is the internal devaluation that comes with the territory. It will take decades to bounce back from that. Look at DDR, they got every conceivable help and are still not on Western German levels, 23 years after the fact. Spain gets no help - will it take 40 years then? 50? 

So, leave the Euro, that is my advice.

The Scottish government provides free prescriptions and subsidises higher education (paid for by Scottish taxpayers, not subsidies from rUK). It is aiming for 100% of electricity and 11% of heat to come from renewables by 2020 (electricity is currently at 35%; the UK target for 2020 is 30%).

They have proposed a written constitution, the removal of nuclear weapons, and elections are run using a proportional representation system. The smoking ban was introduced a year earlier than the rest of the UK, and they plan to introduce minimum alcohol pricing and plain packaging for cigarettes.

I support some of these, in some form or another, but the significant point is that these are almost all the direct opposite of the policies of the main parties at Westminster.

Independence is not about competing to see ""who's the best"". One country does not have to lose for the other to gain.

&gt; Not a lot. The Spanish economy is not the EU's responsibility, and any solution would involve going beyond the commitments that the EU states have made.

I am not asking about that. I think that giving more money to my government makes the situation worse in the long term. And economic problems are created by the political problems. Acting in the economy before fixing the political and legal framework is not working.

Political intervention is totally forbidden in the EU that's right. However, EU put Mario Monti as PM of Italy some time.

FFP allows for clubs to spend as much as they want on infrastructure, training facilities and youth development. It's mainly wages and transfer fees that the FFP seeks the curb the spending on by balancing it against gate receipts and other income (sponsorship etc)

In theory, a club could get a wealthy benefactor who could build a massive stadium (Manchester City are currently in the process of expanding the Etihad) to increase revenue to spend on players.

D'une, à l'époque de Nuremberg, les soviétiques ont écarté certains éléments avec l'accord des autres alliés car ça les mettait en cause, notamment pour le partage de la Pologne. 

De deux, je n'ai pas parlé des 6 millions, c'est toi qui fait une fixation dessus, il n'y a toujours pas consensus sur le nombre de morts, et je pensais qu'on pouvait avoir une discussion sérieuse. 

De trois, bon courage pour nier les 6 millions face au grand public. Trouve moi une seule personne non condamnée qui a parlé de moins de 6 millions de juifs... On en est plutôt [à exagérer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxv0aNDiQU).

&gt;Non, la Shoah est un fait historique, la bible est une création fantasmagorique.

Tu n'as pas compris ce que j'ai dit. La Bible existe, j'en ai une sur mes étagères. Ça ne veut pas dire que ce qu'elle dit est vraie. Ça veut dire que des gens ont écrit ce qu'il y a dedans. Maintenant relis ma phrase.

&gt;Cite moi une seule personne n'étant pas d'extrême droite ou proche de milieu connu comme fleurtant avec l'antisémitisme qui pose d'honnête question sur la Shoah ?

Affirmation Ridicule. Il y en a pas mal à l'extrême gauche. Garaudy ou Pierre Guillaume par exemple. Annie Lacroix-Ruiz, malgré le peu de crédit que je lui donne, a insisté sur le mal qu'elle avait à publier certains de ses travaux, et que d'autres étaient tout simplement interdits.

&gt;Bizarrement les ""révisionniste"" pose toujours des questions sur l'Histoire de la shoah en remettant en cause l'histoire officiel mais ne questionne jamais ceux qui leur amène le discours révisionniste.

Having received the initial complaint in November 2009, it has delayed reaching a decision on the issue despite a regulation one-year deadline.

&gt; WTF. Why aren't all these people fired? That is blatant corruption and breaking of the rules. Why does the EU keep corrupt peope in power? 

Because those are frankly ridiculous allegations. FYI, DG Competition, and Vice-President Almunia, just got an enormous backlash in Spain after ruling that [struggling Spanish shipyards had to pay back, as illegal state aid, some substantial tax breaks that ship buyers had been getting these last years](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23344489). This has led to big demonstrations by shipyard workers, [not least in Almunia's own hometown of Bilbao, which could be badly hit by those sanctions](http://www.deia.com/2013/07/11/economia/miles-de-personas-marchan-entre-sestao-y-santurtzi-para-apoyar-el-sector-naval). Heading those demonstrations is the very same trade union in which Almunia got his start in politics back in the '70s.

The fact is, the whole issue of the ""Sociedades Anonimas Deportivas"" has taken such a long time to resolve because it is an enormous legal mess (on purpose, of course).

Non hai fornito argomentazioni, hai detto semplicemente che non accadrà mai che si farà anestesia. Questa tua affermazione è in contrasto con il testo di legge. Non ho mai parlato di ambito veterinario. La fonte te l'ho citata sopra, rileggi. Non c'è scritto che l'anestesia non serve sotto alcuna soglia di dolore, mentre c'è scritto che va applicata a qualsiasi ricerca. Infatti già la ASL locale ci ha chiesto come abbiamo intenzione di comportarci se il testo verrà recepito così. Se tu stai interpretando il testo come ""non serve anestesia sotto una certa soglia di dolore"" rifacendoti alla direttiva europea, ti ricordo che la direttiva europea non è legge e non fa testo, fino al suo recepimento, e anche in tal caso fa fede ESCLUSIVAMENTE il testo recepito, e non quello della direttiva, negli stati europei.

Add to that, that countries that should have become net contributors, had the strategy worked of actually aiding poorer countries (like greece and Spain) are commanding more resources than ever - well, do you think that sounds like a healthy strategy?

Sì, il mio punto di vista è antropocentrico, perchè antepongo la salute umana a quella animale. Nonostante questo, in molti comitati etici sono presenti anche esponenti di associazioni animaliste, per cui la tua argomentazione non è strettamente valida. C'è anche chi pensa da un punto di vista animalista in chi fa scienza. 

Ad ogni modo, prima di anteporre gli animali alla tua salute, ti invito ad alcune considerazioni: sei vaccinata, prenderai medicine in caso di malattie (probabilmente solo in caso di malattie molto gravi, che penso tu non abbia al momento e che comunque non ti auguro), e anche se tu stessi completamente alla larga da qualsiasi farmaco, sei sana anche perchè almeno il 90% di chi ti circonda è vaccinato, e indirettamente protegge anche te. Puoi stare anche ore a sventagliarmi che gli animali hanno più diritto di noi di vivere dal trono sano e sicuro che ti ha donato la società costruita proprio grazie al loro sacrificio, e come al solito ti guarderò con l'affettuoso sorriso che si riserva ai bambini inconsapevoli del mondo in cui vivono. Ogni prodotto che usi è stato testato su animali in passato, anche i ""cruelty free"", che in realtà non lo sono. Abiti probabilmente in una città derattizzata con esche che causano morti atroci per emorraggia interna a centinaia di migliaia di animali, e ti sta bene se il tuo cassonetto sottocasa non somiglia a [questo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWVw-j8eYSk). Puoi dirmi per mille ore che [l'omeopatia è meglio della medicina](http://www.howdoeshomeopathywork.com/) perchè è naturale, che possiamo curarci con le erbe (come se non le testassimo sugli animali, poi). Quando si parla di animali sacrificati non stiamo parlando di coniglietti su cui testiamo il rimmel con cui qualche vecchia starnazzante può darsi ancora per qualche anno l'illusione di essere per sempre giovane, stiamo parlando di persone a cui è negata una vita e di una guerra che si combatte dagli albori del tempo per la sopravvivenza delle specie, guerra che, dell'anteporre la vita di un topo a quella umana, ride di gusto.

In un mondo normale rispetterei la tua scelta di morire male per aver rifiutato certe opzioni scomode, per scelta etica.

Another party, UPyD, that is becoming more and more popular with the downfall of the two traditional parties, wants to eliminate the traditional autonomy and self-government of the Basque Country and its neighbor Navarre. We reflect our discontent every election; the pro-autonomy and pro-independence parties have an overwhelming majority in the Basque parliament and in the local governments (the leftist pro-independence EHBildu and the center-right Basque Nationalist Party).

And let's not forget the complete disregard and contempt to our cultural territory. The [Greater Basque Country, or Euskal Herria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country) is a **cultural and historical** territory that comprises Euskadi, Navarre (southern Basque Country, both in Spain) and Iparralde (northern Basque Country, in France), territories where the Basque has been spoken since pre-Indo-European times and where our culture still lives strong. Yet, you can hear people everywhere, but as with every other ignorant thing, it is more frequent here on the Internet, that ""Euskal Herria doesn't exist"", even equating it with Narnia, failing to understand (or perhaps not willing to understand) that Euskal Herria is not or has not been (yet) a state, is just a cultural, historical territory, as there are many in Europe. But no, for the Spanish nationalists it is as real as Narnia. And let's not forget those (you can find one or two of them just here in this thread!) who believe we are all just terrorists willing to kill everybody. There's been cases of people being called *etarra* (Basque terrorist) just for speaking Basque. We get tired of all this BS.

EEG stands for Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz, in English: Renewable Energy Law. As we face global warming, we want to reduce our CO2 by investing in renewable energy, which costs a lot of money. This money has to come from someone -&gt; the end user. An example would be the funding of photovoltaic installations on private households. I'm currently in the process of getting one myself, so it is like this: To give people incentives to invest in their own photovoltaic, the government decided to pay a private owner A LOT money per kWh that is produced on their roofs. This price is also FIX for TWENTY YEARS. So, by now the price has declined to 15cents per kWh. only two years ago, this was still at 28cents per kWh. And a couple years before that, it was even higher. So, all those people get paid for the energy they produce a lot more than what energy companies earn by selling energy. Hence, they raise the price. There is still a lot more to this, I guess, but that's as far as I know.

Price gets adjusted by demand, until as many power plants run at a given time as are neccessary to fulfill demand. Now say that nuclear energy costs 3, coal 5, wind 20 and solar 50 [ct/kWh]. At low demand, wind and solar aren't used, so the price will be around 5. At high demand, the price will instantly rise to 50.

Now if you run a nuclear plant, you make 2 ct/kWh at low demand. At high demand, you make 47 ct/kWh. So high demand is desirable. Or low supply.

What you do is this: You switch off half your nuclear power plants, and you extend maintenance procedures until the prices rise into favorable regions.

In fact, in the seventies streets became so clogged up with cars, that the city came to a standstill. This was a natural consequence of 100% car oriented policies: everybody firmly believed the car was the future. Check for example this footage from the 60s and 70s:

When the babyboom generation became active in politics they had strongly egalitarian (often extreme left) views and a more acute awareness of ecological problems.
The bike fit perfectly in this picture.
They launched, for example, the ""witte fietsen plan"" with white painted bikes free to be used for anyone (can't find a good link). (They also actually had a sharing plan with small electic cars for some time).
Given that the medieval street plan of most Dutch city centers, there were few options to improve the cituations for cars. Actually many cities drained canals (not only Amsterdam has those) in the center to make more room. The bicycle became an acceptable alternative for all parties.

There was a ""think of the children"" movement to make bicycle driving safer:

I would assume you're from the U.S., in that case, main differences are that
* We don't have that 24/7 culture, do not expect going to the supermarket later than 10pm, it will be closed, same for fast-food restaurant, most close at 11-12pm maybe 1am... depends on the season/place.

* Forget about cars, unless you're traveling between cities, but most 
cities are ""walkable"" or have a decent network of bus/metro

* You will see way less fast-food chains than in the U.S.

* Very few people will speak English, but we'll try to help you anyway, don't expect waiters/anyone to speak it unless you're in a very touristic place

* We do not use credit cards that much, but you could still pay with it in most places, some places will require a minimum purchase about 12-15€ to accept credit card

* No need for tipping, but it's welcome. **Note:** we DO tip, but not as much as in the U.S. Around 8-10% is OK, but it depends a lot on the service. Also I didn't find a place yet that allows me to tip via credit card (as you do in the U.S.)

* Avoid tourist traps as much as you can, also avoid anything in a jar/pitch in said tourist restaurants, they could bill you as high as 30€ for 3/4 liter of sangria that at the supermarket is 1.50€. They usually have on the menu the price per glass (maybe 2-3€) but not the price per a jar (4-6 glasses), so you pay a lot more.

You can see them for yourself. A lot of things that contradict the bible and jessus. From the opulence of patriarchs who are dressed from head to toe in gold and silver, riding expensive cars, living in mansions.

The sole purpose of christianity, as written in that book ya'all seem to conveniently ignore, is to help people. 

Nowhere in that specific book does it say that there needs to be a specific number of churches, or priests, or level of organization. It doesn't say anywhere that the people need a building for their redemption (mantuirii neamului), that's why jessus died, right? For our sins? But we still need the state to build loads and loads of churches while ignore the sole purpose of the religion itself which is helping the people in need. 

And right now, the people in need are helping the church, not the other way around.

true,peripatos,UNSA,USA,"Briefly, both judges and lawyers in both criminal and civil cases wear robes.  The white ties only show up in a criminal proceeding. 

A degree of decorum probably helps the legal profession (see Jansen, The Making of Legal Authority). After all, the law is a fiction, an abstraction not really existing in physical terms. So in order to enforce peace on disputing parties it needs to rely on presentation, authority and rhetoric. Otherwise, why obey a verdict? Before a verdict can overrule, say, a general leading an army who wants to usurp the government, a civilization has to arrive at a respect for law, judges, lawyers and their decisions which seems extremely unnatural in an historical context.

So, do the robe and ties help?

I think the robe does, and in criminal proceedings – which in contrast to civil proceedings require wearing a white tie – the white tie does as well. It demonstrates a certain status and division of roles which is unavoidable if courts are to work. Also, “dressing up” is typically done for momentous occasions, e.g. weddings, funerals. I think putting on a robe and tie in a criminal proceeding also shows a level of respect for the severity of the situation of the accused; it shows that the people involved take it all seriously.

The way the judge’s bench is situated above the disputing parties but also between them demonstrates his decision-making authority and also his neutrality. So that would be another example of an appropriate architectural innovation to reflect and reinforce the nature of legal proceedings. The robe and tie are similar.

In district courts (Amtsgerichte) it is no longer legally required to wear a robe, but it is recommended. I wear a robe but am not excessively fussy about my appearance. It’s not about how well the robe fits or whether it is perfectly ironed. It is just about taking the time and trouble to put on the robe.

Wearing the robe is also a symbol of the professional equality among lawyers and judges.",0,1375964564,null,0,false,0,cbjg0wi,t3_1jxs8y,t1_cbjg0wi,t1_cbjf0co,null,1429903199,10,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,10

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Yours was a banking crisis.

No, it was not. It was just one of the many symptoms. We had, for decades, increased our taxes and salaries, and benefits, plus costs for the companies (they paid more and more in taxes), read up for example on the [transaction tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_financial_transaction_tax) which is just one of the many fun taxes we had (by the way, you are going for it now, have fun). A standard solution for the Swedish government was also to devalue the krona. So, the crises was deep, and across the board.

And, whether a currency was overvalued or not , it helped our export industry tremendously, and helped us to getting some breathing space, to get some air under our wings. The Swedish recovery was actually rather swift, and fast, seeing how deep down we were.

I think it is fun that you tell me to read up about things you clearly have no clue about. 

It is also fun that you are comparing Spain to Sweden. The reason Spain is in the shitters right now is not because of anything the Spanish people/government has done. Sure, you might have had a banking crises and a few bad years, and the corruptions is to high, but that is not why you are where you are at right now. Spain is in the slumps because of the Euro. You decided to take part in the most imperfect of currency unions, the Euro, and what you are experiencing now is internal devaluation. The goods you previously sold are to expensive for other countries to by, and the Spanish productivity (no don't accuse me of saying you are lazy, there's a difference between lazy and productive) is far too low to compete with the likes of the Netherlands and Germany. That way, you are trying to press down the costs in the only way left to you  - by pushing labour costs down. Horrible, but basic Economics. Head over to /r/economics  and see what they say about the Euro......



&gt;hould be a bit more understanding of other countries that find themselves in the same position.

Sweden and Spain are not the same, in that we are/were not in the same position. Sweden had a few , but *enormous* advantages We had our own currency and could make our own financial deciscions. We also have what is now probably the most indepent central bank in the world (we were determined to never be in the same position again, so we modelled it after the former Bundesbank, in fact it is so independent that it is frequently critiscised for it, people wish it could be a bit more like the Fed, or the Bank of England). So, we could control our own destiny. Spain can not, they have no choice but to keep up the austerity, unemployment etc. Sweden had choices. Yes, our money was worth less, but we had jobs again. I think a lot of Spanish people would choose that route, if they could, but you can not. You have the Euro. 

In fact, *had* we been the same, you would have been well on your way to recovery now. Five years after our crises broke out, we were well on our way to recovery. You are not, because of the Euro.

Frankly, imagine if you have had the oppurtunity to lower the currency and get some breathing space, some air, so the companies could start selling again, unemployment dow. It would be great to get some air under the wings again, wouldn't it? Some breathing space. It is not the whole solution, system needs to be changed, but it is easier changing them while unemployment is going down, belive me, and people have hope again. 

That said, I do not wish the Spanish people to be unemployed and Spain to go down in the shitters,  but as long as you are in the Euro I do not see how you can avoid it.  Your choice I guess. Personally I think you should leave the Euro (not the EU). It is all rather standard Economics 101 what is happening in Spain. That is also the reason why it will stay bad for you for at least another decade, I guess two three decades. I'd take my chances with the pesetas. 


&gt; ""corrupt Southern countries""

So, they are not? My tax money will be just as well spent in Greece as in Finland? There is absolutely no risk for Sweden in handing over more descion making to the EU? Can you promise me there is less corruption in the EU than in Sweden? If not, why should we bow down to more corruption?

true,jarhead-in-germany,UNSA,USA,"Frankfurt's a big, international city with tons of expats and foreign visitors.  The city is well accustomed to handling non-Germans and non-German speakers.  Just don't be a stereotypical American asshole and you'll be fine.  Don't start blurting out English, say politely, ""Ich sprechen kein Deutsch.  Sprechen Sie English bitte?"" (I don't speak German.  Can you please speak English?) and 99% of the people you come across will be happy to converse with you in English.  Even if they say that they only know ""a little bit,"" I can guarantee it's much better than your (or my) German.

Depending on how much time you have, I'd suggest checking out some apfelweinwirtshafts (apple cider houses) in the Sachsenhausen district.  Apfelwein, or ebbelwoi in the local dialect, is the traditional drink in Frankfurt and it's pretty goddamned tasty.  A little more sour than American tastebuds are used to, but I've grown to love the stuff.  Look for tiny hole in the wall restaurants with green wreaths on signs, doors, or hanging from the front.  Avoid the tourist traps like Apfelwein Wagner, they're filled with tourists and business travelers, the service sucks and the food is shit.  The one place I went to a few times and really liked was Atschel, but I went to a bunch while I was living there and, aside from the aforementioned tourist traps, liked them all.  The smaller=the better.  Check Yelp.

If you're looking for a traditional Munich-style biergarten, there aren't a whole lot of them, but there is the Paulaner near Roemerberg.  It's a chain restaurant and very kitcshy, but the food and beer are both really good and it's more what Americans would consider ""traditional"" Germany (the girls in dirndls, big steins of beer, etc.).  When most Americans think of Germany, they're really thinking of Bavaria and Frankfurt is not Bavaria.  It's its own place, unique and awesome in its own right, but if you want to get a taste of Bavaria...the Paulaner won't disappoint you.

Oh, and try some schnitzel with Frankfurter Gruenesausse as well. Yum.

There are also some great museums along the south bank of the Main (pronounced ""mine"") near Sachsenhausen (the Museum District) if that's your thing.  The view from the top of the Main Tower is also supposed to be really good if the weather cooperates, but I haven't been yet.  

The Roemerberg area is a great thing to visit.  Very touristy, but fun.  

If you're here for a weekend and can fit a day trip in, Wiesbaden/Mainz is a good choice, as is Heidelberg if you want to see a real castle.  Rothenberg ob der Tauber is also about a two hour drive away in good traffic -- it's the quintessential German walled city and has a huge Christmas store.

My personal recommendation for a day trip, though, would be to drive up to Ruedesheim am Rhine, have lunch there, then take a leisurely drive up the Rhine towards Koblenz.  Stop at a few castles (there are literally dozens of them, some open to visitors, others not, some in ruins) and check them out, try the local reisling wine (it's much better than the reislings you get in the States...ask for ""trocken,"" or dry.  Great stuff).

Oh, one other thing that tripped me up when we got here.  Germans are used to sharing tables with other people.  If you walk into a restaurant and there's no open tables but some open chairs, just sit down, even if there's another group there.  No, I'm not fucking with you -- the first time we walked into a full restaurant and my wife told me to sit down next to a bunch of people, I thought she was screwing with me too.

Hitler began by locking Jews out of the legal profession and kicking Jews who practiced law out of their judgeships and law firms. When the Jews thus excluded from their profession reacted by offering free legal advice, he passed a corollary to the law which made it illegal to do this, as well. So the law which prohibits people who are not admitted as lawyers from giving legal advice for free has its origin in the National Socialist persecution of the Jews.

Today, the law is justified in terms of quality control. With the surfeit of groups offering more or less marginally useful and accurate legal advice to random strangers for cheap, the argument is that it prevents a “race to the bottom”.

However, my opinion is that it would be sufficient if the law merely required people who give out free legal advice to be admitted as lawyers. I have occasionally had a case where I wanted to give free legal advice, or represent someone pro bono, but it was not possible – I actually would end up owing VAT on the service I rendered, even though I never have any income from it, so it ends up costing me potentially a lot of money.

Paralegals have to be certified, have some legal training, and perform actual legal work for which the supervising attorney is ultimately responsible.  Legal secretaries typically prepare filings, do dictation/transcription, general secretarial work, interact with clients, etc.  

Given the differences between US law and German law, I'd imagine it would be absolutely impossible for a US paralegal to do paralegal work in Germany without substantial additional training, while a legal secretary (assuming such a thing exists) would have much lower training requirements that may translate a lot easier.  

Am I correct in assuming, however, that there's no distinction between ""legal secretary"" and ""paralegal"" in Germany?",0,1375965267,null,0,false,0,cbjg5w3,t3_1jxs8y,t1_cbjg5w3,t1_cbjfwtt,null,1429903136,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

true,peripatos,UNSA,USA,"For me, the biggest division is: employee or self-employed.

As a partner, every document that goes out my door represents not only my personality and capability, but also the quality of my firm. It also can lead to me being personally liable for any mistakes that I make with all of my assets, business and personal, right down to the bed that I sleep in at night.

So, if you cannot come to terms with that, and if you cannot demonstrate the work ethic and self-control needed to live up to those demands, then being self-employed is not for you.

Of course, everybody makes mistakes…

The people I know who make good employee lawyers are the ones who work very meticulously and thoroughly and urgently want a paycheck and career advancement. They really learn what their bosses want, are quick studies in terms of acquiring new skills and are great at implementing the demands of higher-ups.

As for the rest of what you said:

If you want to be a judge, I think you need to be all right with giving up control over proceedings. When I was clerking at court, one thing I got aggravated about constantly was my requirement to remain neutral. If a lawyer on one side or the other was screwing up, there was nothing I could do. I always wanted to get my hands dirty, but of course, as a judge, you can’t. You have to work with the materials you’re given to make a verdict.

It’s that same control, incidentally, that I love as a lawyer.

A prosecutor: When I was working in prosecution (also as a Referendar), it was a very unhappy period in my life. I don’t practice criminal law, I dislike it intensely, and I found deciding over people’s fates on the evidence at hand emotionally strenuous. I also didn’t like criminal procedure, it seemed unbelievably formulaic. But the pleadings at the end, before the verdict, were always a bit fun and allowed some personality.

I am not a big fan of Fachanwaltschaften. I think they suggest a level of competency which non-Fachanwalt lawyers may well have, and all the Fachanwalt says is that you went to some courses and did a few tests. I find that my time is better spent learning specific issues rather than going to formal education.

In large cities, being a Fachanwalt is a good idea because of the degree of competition. It’s an easy, fast way to distinguish yourself and define your area of specialty.

In my small town, that spreads mostly through word of mouth.",0,1375965637,null,0,false,0,cbjg8nw,t3_1jxs8y,t1_cbjg8nw,t1_cbjf6xr,null,1429903099,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

true,aalorni,null,null,"I wanted to give my two cents. From reverse, I think the German legal market as a whole is much different than in the US and comparing the strength of one versus the other is difficult.  As with many areas of commerce, the sheer size of the US relative to Germany is important to keep in mind. Size doesn't always equal power, but the size of the US economy, the number of lawyers and the market cap of corporations that feed the hungry big law monster are all things to consider. 

Germany has a bar exam followed by a mandatory clerkship for two years plus another bar exam. I passed the CA bar exam on my first go and people say it is the hardest in the US. When I got here I gained a whole new perspective. All this amounts to fewer lawyers and, I argue, better prepared starting lawyers. I know German lawyers who are fully qualified (IMO) to begin offering legal advice after bar admission. I rarely met anyone that inspired that confidence in me in CA. 

The German legal market is cheaper and there are fewer lawyers, especially in the rural areas. Germans also have legal insurance, which we don't have in the US. German lawyers are a bit shocked at my hourly rate and I am equally but in a different direction shocked sometimes at theirs.  If I had the choice, I would be a Rechtsanwältin. 

Which leads me to being a non-German lawyer in Germany. I am a member of the bar association (Rechtsanwaltskammer) of my district. But I am admitted as an Attorney-at-Law. Why is this relevant?  The German word for lawyer is both Anwalt (or Anwältin) and Rechtsanwalt (or Rechtsanwältin). However, some RAKs consider Rechtsanwalt to be a protected term whereas others do not. So in my district it would be illegal to refer to myself as a Rechtsanwältin of even an auslandishe Rechtsanwältin. They seem okay with Anwältin but they really would prefer Attorney-at-Law only.  But despite the RAK's attemps otherwise, I still get clients, pay the bills and keep the lights on.

One more thing to note. A lot of the big law lawyers in Germany all have LLMs from America (generally NY) and most are members of the NY bar. A lot also have law doctorates (dr. iur.). Neither an LLM (unless in tax from Georgetown) or a law doctorate is seen much with US lawyers, or even with US legal academics. I can't say what, if anything, this means to the quality here but it is an interesting observation.

Basically, I’m beginning to consider residential rental law not really as belonging to contract law due to the level to which statutes have infiltrated party autonomy. Even when two parties may, e.g., want a time-limitation to the rental agreement, it can end up being invalid, so that the only one who ends up happy is the legislature.

true,gundis,null,null,"Okay, I'll give it a try:

Shutting down the nuclear power plant is not the reason that our prices for electricity become so expensive. It is more like this:

1. More states want Fuel like coal, oil and so on for their power production, so the price to buy ressources grows.

2. Now it gets complicated: The EEG-Umlage like belixX already mentioned. 

The EEG-Umlage is the following: Our government decided at one point (1991, later 2000), It would like to have more renewable energy produced, so it subsidized power plants running on wind, solar or water-Energy as this: For every kilowatt-hour produced by such an power plant, the producer gets a for years fixed price. Everyone who uses any electricity has to pay an amount to cover this price.
 
The price one gets for producing green energy is:

 fixed price = actual price on the market + tax payed by users of electricity (if there is a difference).
 
(BTW: Coal power plants and nuclear power plants are also subsidized, our country pays e.g. nuclear waste storage, for trade of coal emmission certificates or directly money to the energy producers ). 

But there are some exceptions: corporations which use a lot of electricity can claim, they would not have a chance on the international market and so have not tho pay the EEG-Umlage. There is a growing number of corporations who do this.

The result is the following: the number of producers of renewable energy grows and on the other side the number of people/corporations who actually pay shrinks. So it is clear, that one has to pay more and more.

There is a second reason for the growing of the EEG: The so called Merit-Order Effect. Because a lot of renewable energy is produced, electricity traded at the stock exchange gets veeeery cheap. (For example in the noon, where everyone wants to have a cooked meal and uses stove and oven and so needs electricity, the electricity could easy be produced by solar power plants who produce especially much around noon, but coal or oil plants produce electricity too at this time, so there is ""to much electricity to few people who want to buy it""-&gt; price at the stock exchange will shrink). One then has to pay for the difference like I explained above.

I hope this was not too long and helps you to understand. If not, just ask.

You my friend are having a discussion with somebody else, certainly not with me. I didn't say any of them are heroes... just that they deserve respect.

This is a message of ""don't blow the whistle"". As for what he published... well, does he not deserve to be defended by armchair activists such as myself even though he didn't expose torture, chemical weapons or sexual scandals?

[wikipédia](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semencier]) en indique 4 dont Monsanto.

[Un article](http://www.bastamag.net/article3109.html) rapporte ceci , suite à une condamnation à 450€ d'amendes pour avoir vendu des variétés de tomates non inscrites au catalogue officiel:

&gt; Des 876 variétés potagères inscrites en 1954, il n’en restait plus que 182 au catalogue officiel français en 2002. La raison de ces radiations ? Le poids de l’industrie semencière, qui, depuis cinquante ans, cherche « à standardiser les semences pour les adapter partout aux mêmes engrais et pesticides chimiques », estime le Réseau semences paysannes.

&gt; Cette action intervient alors que la législation sur la commercialisation des semences et des plants est en cours de révision à l’échelle européenne

&gt; Nous nous dirigeons lentement mais surement vers l’appauvrissement de la diversité agricole au profit du monopole des grands semenciers avec la bénédiction des gouvernement éluent.
Au delà des impactes économiques et sociétaux, la grande inconnu reste le véritable impacte environnemental que cette approvisionnement pourra avoir sur la faune et la flore. La disparition des abeilles témoignant déjà de catastrophes à venir.

Je crois qu'une bonne partie des recherches commerciales sur les OGM consiste à les adapter aux engrais (meilleur rendement) et pesticides (meilleure résistance) commercialisés par ces entreprises, donc la problématique de la recherche OGM commerciale et de la règlementation sur les semences ont bien des points communs.

Peu importe si les semences hybrides ne sont pas légalement réutilisables, parce qu'en pratique les semences hybrides de deuxième génération n'ont pas les propriétés de celles achetées, donc en pratique les paysans sont obligés de les racheter.

En revanche, des tas de variétés anciennes tout à fait classiques et libres de droit ne sont pas au catalogue, donc un paysan est obligé de produire ses propres semences et ne peut pas les revendre, et il me semble que cela conduit à la disparition de ces variétés ancienne et donc nuit à la biodiversité.

true,the-fritz,null,null,"The important thing you have to understand is that the electrical grid always has to be balanced. The energy put into it has to be used somewhere or else the grid collapses. Of course the same if there is too much energy demand and not enough energy available. You can't store electrical energy in the grid!

The energy demand varies a lot. There are times with high demand and times with very low demand. With ""conventional"" electrical energy generation you have a lot of control about the production and the grid. There are plans made in advance which plant has to provide what amount of power and which plant is in reserve.

The problem is that many renewable sources can't be controlled. You can't control the sun or wind. So there might be a huge storm at a time when the electrical energy demand is low. It can completely ruin the energy plan. The only thing you could do to protect the grid would be either to shut off the sources or create a higher demand. But the EEG actually demands that ""renewable"" energy is prioritized. The grid operator can't switch them off and has to take the energy. As a result they shut down conventional plants or reduce the price (even negative energy price!).

So now you'd think: Brilliant I get paid to take the energy. Well no **you** don't. The negative price is only available at the energy exchange and thus it benefits industry or pump storage plant operators. And in fact the regular customer has to pay the difference. That's the EEG-Umlage. Private people and small businesses (industry has an exception) are paying for the difference. You are paying if a conventional plant has to be taken off the grid because of too much ""renewable"" energy. Since the beginning of the year you even pay if an offshore plant operator has certain problems. You pay the difference to provide a EEG guaranteed fixed price for ""renewable"" energies.

Meanwhile the grid requires a restructuring to handle the challenges of ""renewables"". And guess who ends up paying for that as well.

tldr: The German grid has too much energy when nobody needs it and you end up paying extra for that. The German grid lacks energy when it is needed and you end up paying extra for that.",0,1375969565,null,0,false,0,cbjh7w4,t3_1jy4tl,t1_cbjh7w4,t1_cbjfpba,null,1429902641,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2
