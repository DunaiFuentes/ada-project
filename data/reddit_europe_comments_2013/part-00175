You know they're planning to subdivide it further. Also, scales. It would be even cheaper to throw away every EU country and create a political union at last. And nothing of value would be lost from throwing Spain, France and everything else away either. Nationalism doesn't solve shit, but it definitely creates a lot of problems. No nations, no problems.

&gt; Any reference?

This has been discussed elsewhere in this thread; Catalonia having more cases than most autonomous communities.

&gt; Also real political autonomy, since the political domination of Madrid over the peripheria has created a fiscal and labour deficit which is centrifugating debt and precariety.

I'd love to see this change. I'm afraid this won't. Also, you're complaining because you live in the second richest region and want to live in the first? Guess I should make my neighbourhood independent as well; that way we'd definitely be the richest in our nation and get ""real political automony"" (yeah right). There are more than enough reasons to ask for independence; in my local pub we say ""tolai"" rather than ""cani"", and my neighbour claims Shakespeare was born in my block.

&gt; But still, there is a difference in our culture and language, right?

Just as big a difference as you'll find between East and West Japan, yet nobody would want to split Japan in chunks for that. It serves little purpose; any region over 100 Km wide is going to have slightly different history and culture. The good thing is we're slowly learning to leave that apart and join together in order to be stronger, cut costs and end conflicts created by local chieftains and petty kings sending random people to kill each other over things that don't benefit or matter to them at all.

&gt; But no one has claimed our culture is better than yours

Who said one is superior to another? I don't even consider Catalan and rest-of-Spain or even rest-of-Iberia to be different cultures. In the grand scale of things (i.e. world = Earth, not world = Iberian peninsula), it's pretty much the same thing with slightly different hues and languages (save for the Basque language — still not relevant to people's everyday problems and still not a good reason to separate).

&gt; For instance, when a fellow redditor argued a few days ago that when we catalans are speaking with a spaniard we should change from our ""regional language"" to spanish, since we know it.

Of course you should; if you don't we'll have a hard time understanding. That's obvious. We could use Castilian to talk to each other right now too, but that would be stupid since other redditors don't know Castilian. Isn't that obvious? This is not a football game; language is merely a tool for communication and we should be using whatever our listeners understand best.

&gt; Do you think a single hospital for all Europe would be better than our current situation?

No, but a single health administration for whatever amount of hospitals we need would be definitely better than over 100 of them full of directors and bureaucrats applying different policies at local chieftains' wishes.

&gt; This is what is killing the central government of Spain.

I hope you understand I **want** to kill the central government in Spain. And Spain. Also blend our ""culture"" into a general European one. Spain as a culture and nation is just another instance of a chieftain trying to run their own state like it's a football match or an Age of Empires videogame, using nationalist tools to perpetuate a sense of division that doesn't solve my real life problems in any way, and wasting tax money on duplicating a lot of things that could be done on a paneuropean scale. I'm not your typical thick-sideburned, Franco fetishist, PPSOE-voting, deep-Spain Spaniard. I actually want to end with both Spain and Catalonia and the autonomous community of EspeLand (redditors: I'm talking about Madrid), which made no sense right from the start — and I kind of hate it, and cut the bullshit to a minimum, hoping one day I'll have a real democracy (as in Switzerland) and get my everyday problems solved efficiently — who cares what language I use when I talk my parents and close friends, the colour of my flag, or whatever my ID card reads? That matters shit, while getting unified taxes with no tax havens, standard social security and greener policies which we'd never get from PPSOE, for example, do matter to me right as I'm writing this.",0,1377243525,null,0,1377358935,0,cbtm330,t3_1kuwz1,t1_cbtm330,t1_cbsxqtl,null,1429729445,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Why do you have that law? The only way the Guardian can properly estimate that *according to your goverment and security services* is by cooperating with them. Obviously, the Secuity Services can and will lie to protect the government (as is so evident in how the Iraqi war was handled and the fact that Cameron is spying on his own people) so *if* you have this law in place, you need a third party, that can assess the threat to the public, without eating out of Blair/Cameron's hand. The Security Services are, by their own doing, not to be trusted. 

And, this might surprise you, but other countries have threats against  them and too - and they can manage them *without* destroying hard drives and telling the press what to write? What makes the UK so unique, or so threatened, that they need extra securities. Also, if the data was so damaging to the public - who has dies? 

If France/Germany can manage it, why can't the UK? 

So, as long as you have Security Services that works, not for the people, but for the government, you can not expect any self respecting newspaper to trust them. I would not - they have shown that they will happily lie and spy.

If you're handling raw data that possibly contains information that could get people killed, then the media organisation that holds the data has a moral duty to keep that information safe, and away from as many people who do not have to see the information in order to develop a story as possible.

Can you cite a remotely similar situation of anything like this happening in France or Germany?

No.  Of course you can't.  The situation is almost unprecedented.

Why your libel laws need changing? You truly do not know? In the UK one can (and has been) sued for printing correct scientific research. That means that for example scientists who wanted to publish research how something didnt't work, a patented operation method for example, could be forced not to publish it, because of threat to sue. To me, that is not freedom of science and freedom of the press. Apperently it is OK for the UK.

If you compare the mean disposable wages rather than the Median you will see that UK is only about 20% ahead of Spain [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage).

1) Dire que Manning ""profite"" de sa notoriété pour parler de son changement de genre. J'ai plutôt l'impression que c'est l'inverse : si Manning n'avait pas été très médiatisée je ne pense pas qu'il y aurait eu une réelle nécessité de communication sur le sujet.

Ma perception des déclarations de Manning est que d'un côté il y a ses convictions sur la liberté et les droits qui l'a poussée à divulger des informations confidentielles et de l'autre côté son trouble sexuel qui n'est pas spécialement un combat dont elle s'est fait le porte-étendard.

A large part of their issues stem from being unable to function in a productive way in a modern society, which is partly because they move around a lot, but mostly because of the no education. 

At this stage it's ingrained into their culture to not value education. We can see around the world that cultures that DO value education thrive.

Another point; in Ireland, 87% of gypsies are on welfare.

Therefore, if you make it so if they pull their kids out of school they lose their welfare (including the majority of gypsies who live in government funded housing now), they will presumably put more focus on keeping their kids in school, giving them a better shot at life, reducing crime, encouraging settlement and integration and long term, no more gypsies.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; You know they're planning to subdivide it further. 

Vegueries in substitution of provincies and counties' coordination in substitution of ""comarques"", that what a lot of people advocates for. And that wouldn't be anymore your problem right? Why do you care so much about the expenses we would have?

&gt; Also, scales. It would be even cheaper to throw away every EU country and create a political union at last. 

False. Democratic effects of decentralization. Efficiency gains as marginal revenue and benefits decrease at large scale. Take a look at any textbook of public economy. Can you at least do linear programming? Do you understand the idea behind it?

&gt; And nothing of value would be lost from throwing Spain, France and everything else away either. Nationalism doesn't solve shit, but it definitely creates a lot of problems. No nations, no problems.

An anthropologist or a sociologist would explain that better, but you can not reallt end with nations, as they are a social construction, and we need social construction to, literally, live, we need to stick to a territory and a culture, there can't be such a thing as only one culture and one territory of reference.

&gt; This has been discussed elsewhere in this thread; Catalonia having more cases than most autonomous communities.


Yes, I have provided the data. And turns out that, with 16.9 cases of corruption for million inhabitants, Catalonia is one of the CCAA (6th least) with less cases of corruption.

&gt; Also, you're complaining because you live in the second richest region and want to live in the first? Guess I should make my neighbourhood independent as well; that way we'd definitely be the richest in our nation and get ""real political automony"" (yeah right). There are more than enough reasons to ask for independence; in my local pub we say ""tolai"" rather than ""cani"".

Language and culture is relevant. I'm not discussing the legitimacy of our claims, we're demanding it and that should be enough. Regarding richness and political autonomy, you obviously don't know what you're talking about. Madrid is killing the peripheria, and at long term this will mean Spain will consist of Madrid+its playgrounds+cheap factories. I am frankly not willing to educate you regarding what data and which analysis could provide you an insight on the amount of shit the central government is doing, much better to me if you keep ignoring these dynamics.

&gt; , and my neighbour claims Shakespeare was born in my block.
Strawman? Again? Good for you.


&gt; Of course you should; if you don't we'll have a hard time understanding. That's obvious. We could use Castilian to talk to each other right now too, but that would be stupid since other redditors don't know Castilian. Isn't that obvious?

But however you don't demand the french to learn spanish so you can understand each other right? This position effectively places catalan in an inferior position and it creates a threat of linguistic substitution. I would like to keep living in my mother tongue if you don't mind.

&gt; language is merely a tool for communication and we should be using whatever our listeners understand best.


Again, a sociologist would laugh at your claims.

&gt; No, but a single health administration for whatever amount of hospitals we need would be definitely better than over 100 of them full of directors and bureaucrats applying different policies at local chieftains' wishes.

Hello? TSE? Coordination and not union is what matters, even in a unique system. Besides that, I appreciate competition in a public funded PP partnership. 

&gt; I hope you understand I want to kill the central government in Spain. And Spain. Also blend our ""culture"" into a general European one (which It's just another instance of a chieftain trying to run their own state like it's a football match or an Age of Empires videogame, using nationalist tools to perpetuate a sense of division that doesn't solve my real life problems in any way, and wasting tax money on duplicating a lot of things that could be done on a paneuropean scale. I'm not your typical thick-sideburned, Franco fetishist, PPSOE-voting, deep-Spain Spaniard. I actually want to end with both Spain and Catalonia and the autonomous community of EspeLand (redditors: I'm talking about Madrid), which made no sense right from the start — and I kind of hate it, and cut the bullshit to a minimum, hoping one day I'll have a real democracy (as in Switzerland) and get my everyday problems solved efficiently — who cares what language I use when I talk my parents and close friends, the colour of my flag, or whatever my ID card reads? That matters shit, while getting unified taxes with no tax havens, standard social security and greener policies which we'd never get from PPSOE, for example, do matter to me right as I'm writing this.

&gt;""It was agreed to on the understanding that **the purpose of the destruction of the material would not impinge on the Guardian's ability to publish articles about the issue**, but would help as a precautionary measure to protect lives and security.""

--------------------------

This is quite simple. These are the facts as I understand them. I would be interested if anyone disagreed with any of these.

 - The UK is an active target of terrorism. Most of these threats come from British terrorists.

 - GCHQ is the most important part of the UK's counter-terror ability.

 - Signals Intelligence relies on your targets not knowing your methods.

 - Edward Snowden stole information that if widely known could seriously jeopardise GCHQ's ability to fight terrorism.

 - GCHQ's methods are arguably too intrusive into people's personal information

 - The Guardian has a right to inform the public about such things in a responsible way

 - *The information that Snowden leaked is more extensive than what the Guardian has decided it was in the public interest to report*.

 - The Guardian left the rest of the top secret information on a computer in its London office and told the whole world it had it there

 - This is a major security risk

 - The Guardian has copies of the data in unknown locations

-----------------------------------

Considering all of these factors, what is the issue that /r/europe has with the Government requesting that the Guardian destroy *the London copy of the data*, and then checking that they did in fact do it?

This is a win-win situation, as agreed by the Government and the editor of the Guardian. They can continue to publish, and the blatant security risk has been stopped.

true,fuchsiamatter,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Aww, poor citizens, unable to understand that what we are doing is really for your benefit. Here, have a biscuit and a pat on the head.

Seriously? Complicated things are complicated. It’s not condescending to point that out. I did a master’s in European law and currently work in a related area and all that has done has been to help me understand how much I *don’t* understand about the subject; I have friends writing PhD theses on the topic and they groan in confusion when they have to deal with these questions. It’s very difficult and what I was pointing out was that, while this complexity is perfect breeding ground for misinformation and bewilderment on the part of people who haven’t chosen to actually make a living in the area, it’s impossible to do away with it without sacrificing the respect for national sovereignty and cultural diversity the EU prides itself on. 

But I’m sure you were born with all the world’s knowledge already firmly lodged in your brain so the slightest insinuation that something might be hard and time-consuming for others to fully grasp is nothing short of an insult for you. 

&gt; As you will well know, the last time Cameron used a veto the decision went ahead anyway, merely with Britain excluded. Which rather undermines the ""democratic legitimacy"" you imagine.

I assume you’re referring to this fiasco: http://www.economist.com/node/21546030

Setting aside the fact that that had absolutely nothing to do with the co-decision procedure I mentioned above, but instead was related to a proposed treaty, making it an entiiiiiiiiiiiirely different kind of veto – and in fact, not really a veto in technical terms at all – here’s the thing:

What Cameron “vetoed” was the proposal to set up the new eurozone fiscal union and embody its rules in a new EU treaty. This forced the rest of the EU to proceed instead by way of an intergovernmental pact outside the Lisbon Treaty. So, the “veto” did in fact catch, the proposal was blocked and other Member States were forced to use other avenues, which we were apparently surprised about (clearly we don’t care much about other countries' national sovereignty as much as we do about our own??). You can stop other members from using the clubhouse sitting room for meetings on something you disagree with, but you can’t stop them from gathering to discuss it in the park – all it achieved was excluding the UK from the crucial meetings at which the terms of the pact will be hammered out and I’m still confused as to why we even wanted that. Britain was acting as the playground bully and was surprised when the other kids proved to have a mind of their own and could not be stopped from pursuing their own goals just because we told them we didn’t like it. The only thing that incident proved was Britain’s petulance, bloody-mindedness, complete lack of long-term strategising skills and fantastic ability to seclude ourselves. Oh, and the fact that, counter to what you seem to be suggesting, vetoes do actually work. They’re just not magic mind-control devices. And both these facts would remain unaffected even if the UK were to leave the EU – if anything they would then be more detrimental to our ability to negotiate in defence of our interests.

&gt; We also quite simply don't have a very large number of nationals inside many of the EU institutions, at least in proportion to our size as a country.

And who’s to blame for that? This is exactly what I’m talking about. As a matter of fact, the pass rate among UK candidates for positions in the Commission is currently roughly the same as for the EU as a whole. The problem lies primarily in the low numbers of UK applicants, which is due to the lack of awareness of the opportunities available within the EU: in 2012, only 2.4 per cent of all applicants for EU staff jobs were British, because we are the ones who don’t encourage our citizens to apply for positions with the European institutions! Meantime, nutjobs like Nuttall claim that this is a “grave injustice and injury against British interests” and the UK should “demand equal treatment”! And I mean, what’s the EU supposed to do, forcibly recruit British employees against their will?? The UK is shooting itself in the foot, undermining its own presence in Brussels and British nationalists have the gall to blame the EU for it. Instead, we should stop whining and start internally promoting the benefits of EU positions among young officials. If you refuse to enter the clubhouse when others are holding the door open for you, you have no right to complain about being excluded. 

In any case, it’s worth pointing out that these are administrative positions we’re talking about here, so not really directly relevant to democratic representation per se. 

&gt; There is also a pretty good chance the EU will carve up the financial sector within the next few years, as the EU's more socialistic core do not wish to treat Britain's financial sector with the reverence they have shown France's farming industry. So I don't really buy that side of your argument.

I don’t know what you mean by “carving up the financial sector” nor do I have a crystal ball into the future. Moreover, I’m really, really not interested in petty imaginary fights that present Britain as the disadvantaged underdog and France as the favourite and the teacher’s pet that always gets their way. If you have a real argument to make, make it, but otherwise facts or it didn’t happen. 

&gt; But I think it's bad form to pretend the EU isn't moving towards a federal model, and also that it isn't in many ways already a state

Again, I can’t pretend to know what the EU will end up as. At the moment though it isn’t a state by any meaningful definition of that word: it’s a sui generis supranational organization of a kind that the world has never really seen before – so it’s really hard to make predictions. In any case, it’s not behaving as the federal states constituted in the past have done, in part in that it’s showing zero appetite to use force to solidify its power and expand its base, but primarily because it has no interest in imposing the kind of uniformity of culture and law that federations and superpowers of any kind strive for: it’s very motto is “united in diversity” and it’s proved time and time again that it is invested above and beyond anything else in preserving and cultivating that diversity. If that were not the case, not the UK, but all the smaller countries in Europe would be backpedalling desperately to avoid being sucked in by a megamoster they would have no hope of controlling – instead they’re desperately clamouring to get – or stay – in. 

The UK can choose to become the curmudgeonly old man that secludes himself from the world, nurses petty grievances by imaginary enemies, chases children off his lawn and reminisces of his past prime when he made all the mistakes he still doesn’t recognize, but as a general rule, both when it comes to people and to states, those who thrive are those who align themselves with supportive friends and allies – not those who pit themselves against a world that’s only hostile in their own head.

And now, if you’ll forgive me, I’m actually moving house tomorrow morning, so I really will pull out of this discussion. But if you want to learn more about the EU, even if just to argue more successfully against it, I suggest you try gathering information from sources more reliable than British newspapers.

There needs to be a fine balance between allowing people to freely practice their religion, and allowing people to freely practise their homoesexuality and safely be themselves openly. 

The only issue is that a lot of muslims particularly more radical ones living in the middle east and Europe don't feel they need to respect their side of this bargain. I'm actually not concerned about existing people living in Europe being threatened by the actions of Muslims, but I am concerned about Muslims who move here with their families being scared about coming out and being honest about who they are, due to existing cultural expectation and pressure from their original home country. There's a lot of cases in the UK where Muslims immigrants have rather killed themselves or done other stupid stuff than come out as gay, and there's absolutely no reason for this because stuff such as arranged marriages, which may make coming out as gay extra-difficult aren't actually a Muslim thing anyway, they are cultural and pre-date region and serve no useful purpose what-so-ever. We shouldn't be afraid of stamping down on this unwanted anarchic cultural behaviour, such as arranged marriages or gay hating, when it isn't compatible with our secular society, and when it isn't even part of the Muslim religion anyway. 

Tl;dr: You can be free to practise your religion, but you aren't free to bring over a shit load of cultural expectations that have nothing to do with your religion and enforce them on any friends, family or children you have once living in a western secular society.

I'd like to try to link this into the generally bad relations between modern-day Russia and many of the states of former Soviet Europe, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, etc.

The issue is that each side (Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia et. al. on the one hand, Russia on the other) has fundamentally opposed and even antagonistic ideas of the ""national self"" (inasmuch as we can talk about something like that, while always admitting that speaking so abstractly can be counter-productive or just verbal masturbation).

Fundamentally opposed opinions on the events leading up to and including the Second World War, such as the Molotov(USSR)-Ribbentrop(Nazi Germany) Pact signed on this date that carved up Europe, giving away Poland and the Baltic states to Nazi Germany and the USSR, the role of the Red Army(we say occupiers replacing other occupiers, most Russians say - liberators of Europe), the analysis and outlook on the Soviet years, its collapse, etc.

These are not details, these are ""social memories"" which hold great weight and which make up the discourse of each respective state. And the situation is more or less at an impasse. Each side is trying to de-legitimize the other, the Baltic states trying to show themselves as the small outposts of democracy and Western values on the edge of Europe, standing up to a historically despotic eastern threat, Russia on the other hand always trying to bring attention to the alleged discrimination of Russian minorities in the Baltics, trying to convince the world that Nazis are worshipped in Latvia and that fascism(or neofascism) is very real and has ""taken over""(in Latvia at least, I guess I have to add a caveat that I can speak confidently only about Latvia).

So here we are. And well-intentioned, but naive Western suggestions to move past our historical differences and conflicts falls flat on its face because it doesn't take into account that these fundamental beliefs, which are very deep-rooted indeed, exist and are opposed to each other.",0,1377261052,null,0,false,0,cbton4r,t3_1kxoza,t1_cbton4r,t3_1kxoza,null,1429728210,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19

Well I actually thought about that option and a few other things.

I thought of making multiple accounts to spread my posts to /r/europe over but it seemed like too much of a hassle and I didn't feel like getting banned or something either.

I thought of setting up a news letter which would allow for some more customization or even a blog. The later sounds nice because i'd be able to add stuff at any time but a blog gathering links to other sources doesn't sound too great...idk. I could write some of my own articles for it but I don't have too much free time and I rant too much.

 It would  take away the problem I have now though, in that I can't add new stuff I find on the go. (I could but I don't want to bother the mods anymore. This was the 3rd of 4 dailies that got caught in the spam-filter. Go figure.) For example today I didn't post some very interesting articles because I forgot to check my sources on twitter. (I'll post those tomorrow.)

Regardless I'd doubt it would get all that popular and I'd still post the most important articles and graphs/maps to Reddit (redditors sure love their graphs and maps). So you'd end up seeing content double.

true,FleshyDagger,ESTO,Estonia,"[Background](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Way):

&gt; The Baltic Way or Baltic Chain was a peaceful political demonstration that occurred on August 23, 1989. Approximately two million people joined their hands to form a human chain spanning over 600 kilometres (370 mi) across the three Baltic states – Estonian SSR, Latvian SSR, and Lithuanian SSR, republics of the Soviet Union.

&gt; The demonstration originated in ""Black Ribbon Day"" protests held in the western cities in the 1980s. It marked the 50th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The pact and its secret protocols divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence and led to the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940.

&gt; The event was organised by Baltic pro-independence movements: Rahvarinne of Estonia, the Popular Front of Latvia, and Sąjūdis of Lithuania. The protest was designed to draw global attention by demonstrating a popular desire for independence for each of the entities. It also illustrated solidarity among the three nations. It has been described as an effective publicity campaign, and an emotionally captivating and visually stunning scene. The event presented an opportunity for the Baltic activists to publicise the illegal Soviet occupation and position the question of Baltic independence not as a political matter, but as a moral issue.

&gt; The Soviet authorities in Moscow responded to the event with intense rhetoric, but failed to take any constructive actions that could bridge the widening gap between the Baltic states and the Soviet Union. Within six months of the protest, Lithuania became the first of the Republics of the Soviet Union to declare independence.

There's also a documentary by two American filmmakers about [the Singing Revolution](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0954008/), which the Baltic Way was a part of ([trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm3yzSN8aVk)).",0,1377262153,null,0,1377262388,0,cbtovta,t3_1kw5k3,t1_cbtovta,t3_1kw5k3,null,1429728098,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

We've had a lot of HISTORY happen between us and nowadays we don't really like each other in general. 
Poles learn in primary school that Lithuanians were our BFF, but anyway they tend to treat them arrogant and with disregard. 
Lithuanians on the other hand have built significant part of their national consciousness as a contrary to the ""bad Poles"" (they have their [reasons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BBeligowski's_Mutiny), too).

I think there are some misconceptions about carbonated drinks. Yes, we drink a lot of it, and it's really rare to find non-carbonated water in restaurants, usually it will be some fancy ""silent"" evian or something. Only if you especially order tap water, you will receive tap water.

But I really don't think that it has something to do with us not liking uncarbonated water, but more with the image of it. Tap water is cheap, something poor people do or something. So offering tap water to a guest is a big no-no, like you're the last trailer park trash hillbilly ignoramus. 

Ironically, no guest will actually mind drinking tap water. But the usual protocol would be to offer fancier stuff (juice, tea, carbonated water) and only if you the guest asks for water and you have no fancy water or plain nothing but tap water, then you offer tap water prefixed with an apology about not having to offer anything else.

true,DimReaper,UKGB,United Kingdom,"There's some really interesting information there, thank you very much. A few things jump out at me about different bits of the data.

Immigration is becoming an increasingly large issue in the UK mainstream media and political mindset. I'm genuinely surprised at just how small (comparatively) a proportion of asylum seekers arrive in the UK against many other EU states. A large part of the perceived 'problem' in the UK I suspect is lazy conflation of legal economic migrants, asylum seekers, and illegal immigrants by the media of all political hues, which IMHO are completely different issues with completely different solutions. 

Given that asylum seekers in the legal sense are I believe required to seek asylum in the first safe haven which they can reach, it makes sense that the UK receives less than other periphery countries where the poor and desperate can more easily get themselves to by sea or land routes. It may also be that the current debate and for a large part negativity towards immigrants in large sections of the UK establishment (and wider population in many areas) has made the UK less appealing too, though given the 'first safe haven' caveat that shouldn't really matter to an asylum seeker as opposed to an economic migrant who is moving through choice rather than necessity.

I'm surprised at how large a percentage of asylum seekers the EU as a whole receives compared to other regions of the world too, and unsure why that would be the case; if it's that we're seen to be an aspirational and safe place to resettle, that's great and something to be proud of, but we aren't exactly easy to get to from most troubled parts of the world which begs the question of why the numbers are so high.

&gt;je vous incite à regarder ce documentaire éffarant d'Arte sur comment les sous-traitants travaillent et sont traités dans les centrales françaises

Je ne trouve pas ça effarant du tout. J'ai bossé dans d'autres activités industrielles à risque, et c'est la même chose dans tous les secteurs. C'est également la même chose chez les agriculteurs et éleveurs, qui sont exposés à des produits dangereux constamment. C'est la même chose dans le bâtiment, où il y a de très nombreux accidents du travail. Bref, rien de nouveau, mais quand on dit ""nucléaire"" ça fait peur.

Par contre, le reportage de Arte montre très bien 2 choses : 

1. Une norme, c'est le compromis ""nombre de morts potentiels"" / ""bénéfices attendus"". Tout est là-dedans. Et quand on regarde les chiffres, en particulier avec le bâtiment, on s'aperçoit que le nucléaire est beaucoup moins dangereux.
2. Les radiations sont présentes partout, dans toutes les activités humaines et même dans la nature : il existe même une région, [le Kerala](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) en Inde, où tous les habitants reçoivent tous la dose de 20mSv/an qui est le maximum autorisé pour un travailleur chez EDF.

Conclusion : le nucléaire, ça fait peur. 

Moi ce qui me fait encore plus peur, c'est une politique de remplacement du nucléaire par des combustibles classiques émetteurs de gaz à effet de serre, comme l'Allemagne le fait, comme le Japon le fait. Du coup, le ""risque"" du nucléaire, je suis prêt à le prendre. Et les nombreuses personnes de ma famille qui bossent au Tricastin aussi.

The President of the European Parliament cited a known Stalinst apologist when asked for his favourite book.  Here's what President Schulz said when Eric Hobsbawm died:

           ""Eric Hobsbawm was a man of extraordinary qualities. 
            His books have greatly inspired and influenced my 
            political and historical thoughts.""

Eric Hobsbawm was well known for arguing that had Stalinism been successful in securing a permanent communist ethos then it would have justified the means, including genocide.  In his book the Age of Extremes he might have qualified that the human cost was horrific and shaming but he would still argue,

          ""In a period in which, as you might imagine, mass murder 
           and mass suffering are absolutely universal, the chance 
           of a new world being born in great suffering would still 
           have been worth backing"". 

This is the book that Martin Schulz chose to be reading when photographed for a European photography display.  Not to put too fine a point on it, it would have been like Le Pen choosing to read Mein Kampf and there not being a media shit-storm. Read it by all means, information is power - [but don't have a big goofy grin on your face smiling for the camera whilst you do it, Mr Schulz!](http://www.ukipmeps.org/uploads/file/schulz-marxist-extreme.jpg)

In interview Hobsbawm consistently acted the apologist.  In The Age of Extremes, as seen in the picture, he pushes the argument that the genocide, the war, and the abuse of the Russian people would have only been justifiable had a communist utopia been the end product.  If it had succeeded; that almost anything can be justified as long as the political goals are achieved.  Hobsbawm was known for writing about Stalin but not touching on the show trials or the gulags, revising them out of history.  He described Stalinism as hugely bureaucratic but the new society they were building was 'not a bad society'.  We're talking a major Stalinst apologist, atrocities and all, and it was all absolutely okay with the establishment and European media.   

So no, there isn't the same sort of connection and condemnation for similar acts of crimes against humanity.  It appears we only learnt half the lesson.

Now take all that back to what you said.  You won't find any prominent politicians in high office that will either have such histories or be vocally willing to align themselves with Fascism or fascist apologists.  Wouldn't happen, it would be political suicide.  

The same cannot be said for Stalinism, Maoism or their apologists.  

Now we have the added dimension too where recent admissions to the Union have politicians who prospered in such parties before the collapse of the Soviet Union or their corrupt forms thereafter, all their bureaucracy and civil service, now reinventing themselves within the European Union.  It was only last month newly entered Bulgarians were asking for help from the EU to overthrow a government!  Same politicians, different flag.

Le nucléaire en général.

&gt;Parce que le risque nucléaire a de quoi faire peur quand même!

Oui, car c'est compliqué et que ça nécessite des connaissances pour pouvoir prendre du recul. Déjà pour comprendre [l'unité de mesure](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert) de l'exposition il faut avoir fait une licence en physique ...

&gt;Ça a une demi vie tellement longue que tu ne peux arrêter la catastrophe avec le temps et tu embarques des dizaines de générations avec toi.

Ça reste théoriquement toxique pendant 1000 ans. Comme tout un tas d'autres choses qui ne font pas peur. 

L'inertie de l'environnement par rapport au CO2 par exemple est d'une centaine d'année (chiffre discutable mais passons). 

Moi j'ai beaucoup plus peur du CO2 que du nucléaire. Le nucléaire, c'est local et limité : la vie en France ne s'est pas arrêtée après Tchernobyl ou Fukushima. L'espérance de vie a continué à augmenter. Il y a peut-être eu quelques centaines de cancers et c'est dommage. Mais c'est à peu près le même chiffre que pour l'amiante ou le sang contaminé. Bref, c'est pas joli, mais ça arrive et il n'y a pas de raison de s'en prendre à toute l'industrie.

Par contre, le CO2, c'est mondial et diffus : les changements climatiques affectent toute la planète et sont irréversibles. Remplacer le nucléaire par du CO2, c'est à mon avis bien plus dangereux.

&gt;Les conséquences sur le corps humain (notamment génétiques) sont affreuses.

Comme tout un tas de produits. Le parathion par exemple, largement utilisé comme pesticide et insecticide, est hautement toxique. La cigarette, pourtant en vente légale, l'alcool et tant d'autres drogues provoquent chaque année **des millions** de fois plus de dégâts que le nucléaire. Le tabac par exemple, c'est 5 millions de morts par an, soit un toutes les 4 secondes.

Le charbon par exemple est bien plus dangereux et tue chaque année des dizaines de milliers de personnes.

&gt;Oui, car c'est compliqué et que ça nécessite des connaissances pour pouvoir prendre du recul. Déjà pour comprendre [l'unité de mesure](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert) de l'exposition il faut avoir fait une licence en physique ...

Oui c'est avec l'aéronautique les disciplines les plus complexes tant c'est pointu et touchent divers domaines. Cependant, prendre du recul, n'empêche pas d'en avoir peur mais juste de rationaliser/relativiser. J'ai fait 11 mois de formation en post graduation spécialisée en radioprotection. Donc, je pense avoir une petite idée du risque et des moyens mis en amont pour l'éviter. Je ne suis pas ultra rassurée pour autant.

&gt;Moi j'ai beaucoup plus peur du CO2 que du nucléaire. Le nucléaire, c'est local et limité : la vie en France ne s'est pas arrêtée après Tchernobyl ou Fukushima. 

Euh...en France? Qu'en est il des habitants de Chernobyl et dans une moindre mesure ceux de Fukushima? Pour eux c'est grave.   Aussi, c'est pas forcément très limité non plus.

&gt;Par contre, le CO2, c'est mondial et diffus : les changements climatiques affectent toute la planète et sont irréversibles. Remplacer le nucléaire par du CO2, c'est à mon avis bien plus dangereux.

Oui je suis d'accord.

&gt;Comme tout un tas de produits. Le parathion par exemple, largement utilisé comme pesticide et insecticide, est hautement toxique. La cigarette, pourtant en vente légale, l'alcool et tant d'autres drogues provoquent chaque année **des millions** de fois plus de dégâts que le nucléaire. Le tabac par exemple, c'est 5 millions de morts par an, soit un toutes les 4 secondes.

Le tabac, la drogue, l'alcool tuent ceux qui les consomment. Ça peut s'éviter. Les risques sont contrôlable à l'échelle de l'individu. 


&gt;Et pourtant, on a beaucoup plus peur du nucléaire, de manière complètement exagérée et irrationnelle.

Ce n'est pas parce qu'il y a d'autres catastrophes possibles, d'autres produits toxiques qu'on oublie le risque nucléaire.  Le risque d'une explosion est réduit au minimum proche de 0 mais n'est pas nul. Et c'est très humain/ normal d'en avoir peur. Les risques de morts, de cancers, de troubles de la thyroïde, d'avoir des enfants malformés, ça fait peur. 

Je pense que j'ai compris ta relativisation. Elle tient la route. Je ne sais pas si de mon côté je t'ai convaincu que la peur n'est pas si irrationnelle que ça. Ça reste juste mon avis :)

true,Lesnaya_Grud,null,null,"&gt;I, for one, find it quite flattering that almost half of the asylum applications (more than half if counting the European countries of Norway and Switzerland) are directed towards the EU, despite the fact that the success rate is only about a quarter. It means that the oppressed people around the world see our countries as the primary forces of freedom and the guardians of human rights.

I don't think so. My understanding is that an asylum seeker is just someone who submits paperwork to be legally declared a refugee and are waiting to be resettled elsewhere. It is not difficult to let people into your country for a short time to fill out forms, knowing they'll be out of sight before long. 

[Asylum seeker](http://www.refugees.org/about-us/faqs.html): *An individual outside his or her country of origin seeking refugee status* based on a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion, but whose claim has not been legally substantiated.  *Often, an asylum seeker must undergo a legal procedure in which the host country decides if he/she qualifies for refugee or another form of legal status.* 

The challenge with refugees is *resettling* them and trying to integrate them into society. In this regard Europe does very poorly compared to the rest of the west.

&gt;Not even the US can beat us.

The US resettles 70% of the world's refugees, far more than all European countries combined.

[Even Canada and Australia resettle more refugees than the entire European Union](http://www.amnesty.org/en/refugees-and-migrants/resettlement): European Union countries currently offer between 4,000 and 5,000 places each year, compared to over 50,000 places offered by the USA, 7,000 places by Canada and 6,000 by Australia in recent years.

In no fucking way will we fight against the SAA because we would have too much losses, we would eventually overthrow Bashar but not without hundreds of dead soldiers on our side.

Of course we could start with bombing the shit out of the syrian arab army with jets but the majority of his army would still be able to fight back.

Far too many of my friends are simply 'lost' in the recent spy scandal developments - they are vaguely aware that it's happening but at the same time stuff like Cameron's involvement, most of the specific and darker details are getting lost in the noise. Those who don't read the Guardian or chose to get the majority of their news through the BBC are missing a lot of the crucial details which are prevalent here on Reddit. 

I've just not felt people getting that worked up about it. There few social media reactions (from what I've seen) and it doesn't seem a talking point among people once I log off of Reddit. I'd hope this is through ignorance rather than apathy. The front page of the BBC doesn't mention a thing at this second and I don't believe it got much to any airtime on the nightly news. Newspapers are the ones making the loudest noise - but even that's pretty damn muted outside of the Guardian.

The other problem is that the opposition parties aren't saying a thing either. I don't think I can even find a quote from the leader of the opposing Labour party about any of this; or any of the shadow cabinet. It's like they don't care about it either despite it being political gold for them!

J'ai personnellement espoir dans l'énergie nucléaire, et je pense que les problèmes rencontrés par l'Allemagne étaient parfaitement prévisibles. Je trouve ça dommage que l'industrie nucléaire ait une si mauvaise image, alors que c'est une chose que nous savons bien faire, dont les avantages sont nombreux et dont l'avenir est prometteur. A mon avis, le développement de la filière nucléaire est indispensable, car les énergies renouvelables ne seront pas suffisantes pour combler nos besoins en énergie, que ce soit en termes de quantité ou de qualité.

Apples and oranges. Stalin's wars, both overt and covert, should also be considered if you're comparing the global effect of his rule to that of Hitler. The other fair way of comparing them would be strictly GULAG/purge deaths to concentration camp deaths.

&gt;Italians, Chinese, and Indians- for instance- were not rounded up by communists and killed or put in the gulags.

No, the socialists mostly did that to Jews and whatever ethnic minority happened to piss off Stalin at the moment. 

&gt;What happened during Stalin's time was absolutely horrific, and I'm not trying to say it's less so than Nazism, but it took place behind the Iron Curtain- out of the view and immediate experience of much of the world- unlike WW2.

The world was largely ignorant of what happened in Nazi concentration camps until after the war was over. Try again.

&gt;It's important to understand why Nazism left such an enormous imprint on the world's collective psyche, and why Stalinism didn't.

Yeah, the reason is obvious: politics. Historians and the people that judged Stalin were generally sympathetic to his ultimate goals and cut him slack, considering the millions he killed to be the eggs necessary for that delicious socialist omelette. Mao got the same treatment.

The difference is that the bread cannot produce new products, only labour can. When you are selling your labour power you sell your ability to produce new products. The problem is that the employer does not give you back the full value of your products, but keeps some for himself. That's the theft.

&gt; So either the people who voluntarily accept to work for somebody or the people who voluntarily accept to buy for someone are willing to be robbed?

People who work for somebody accept to be robbed because they have no choice, that's the only way they have to make money, by selling their ability to work. That doesn't negate the fact that part of the result of their labour is stolen.

&gt; Tell me, when two brothers buy lemons from their aunt's garden and sell them to their mates after school, from whom are the stealing?

What part of ""trade is not theft"" did you not understand?

Here's an example: I employ 10 workers that make shoes. They make 100 shoes in a day. I sell them for 1000. I invest 200 of them back to the company, keep 300 for myself and give 500 back to the workers for their salaries. So I make money from their labour, from the value that their labour produces. That's theft.

To that end, the Muslims who moved to Europe face housing and job discrimination, resulting in ghettos of unemployed young Muslims. Most of them aren't that religious; they speak the local language, and they enjoy all the local culture, music, movies, etc.  They are about as different from the Europeans than Black Americans are from White Americans, and fill that role.

trucchi magici non credo esistano, solo qualche consiglio pratico: cercare di evitare, almeno per i primi tempi di circondarti di persone che fumano (fondamentale); cercare di limitare al minimo le azioni dopo le quali di solito accendi una sigaretta come bere caffè, trovare qualche attività/hobby che ti appassioni e che tenga mente e mani occupate.

Con me ha funzionato, o meglio sta funzionando. All'inizio ti sembrerà impossibile, ma pian piano il desiderio sarà sempre più facile da tenere a freno. Pensa che stai facendo la scelta migliore per la tua salute e che sentirai profumi che avevi completamente dimenticato.

 Man mano che passà il tempo mettiti alla prova, tipo passando una serata in mezzo a fumatori. Quando poi ti sentirai veramente sicuro, la prova del 9 è l'ubriacatura. Se non fumi da sbronzo allora sei veramente guarito. 

Dai che ce la fai. In bocca al lupo

Right now we're living in a time where Islam is being revitalized both socially and intellectually, and one of the chief problems faced by religious Muslims is how to bring an enlightened view of their faith up against long-established cultural baggage. In many cases the cultural behaviors severely contradict Islamic teachings or traditions, such as the idea of forced marriages or (in the case of homosexuality) being nosy about others' personal lives or judging others instead of yourself--all things that Muslims are either prohibited from doing or severely discouraged from, and yet in countries with Muslim majorities you see the exact opposite. For example, in Islamic tradition there is absolutely no justifiable case for honor killing, because Islam dictates that citizens must follow the rule of law, which doesn't just mean there are rules to follow, but that there must also be legal institutions, a government body, fair trials, etc. People who do honor killings would be treated like criminals, just as they are in Western countries.

Unfortunately, it's a complicated problem and a tough one to crack; a lot of people think ""enlightened"" Islam is being irreligious, so they encourage Muslims to abandon all of their religious practices, such as fasting, praying, dietary restrictions, dressing more modestly, etc. The 20th century was dominated by this kind of thought, and now you're seeing a backlash by Muslims who wish to preserve their faith, which has unfortunately led to some fundamentalism and extremism. What the religious Muslim community benefits from are leaders who affirm the faith and also stress a progressive and tolerant view. Contrary to what some people think, they do exist and are not even on the fringe, but they definitely do need more support. I think it would be a bad move for us to blame the religion carte blanche, since that thwarts effective reform efforts.

Fracturing between Marxists and Anarchists mostly arose in the 1870s with ideological disagreement between Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx. Both Marxists and anarchists strive for a revolution, and for the same society, but wish to utilise different ways of achieving this goal. Marxists believe the state should be used in the transition phase ""Dictatorship of the Proletariat"" in order to transition capitalist society to communist society after DotP. Anarchists support revolution usually, but do not think the state should have any role in the changing of society.

It's pretty hard to read as your Grandpa writes in dialect from up north in either west, east or far east Germany (far east is today known as Poland or Russia). Also his handwriting looks like he was more comfortable with [Sütterlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCtterlin).

If you can give some information as to where he was from some local might be able to ID the rest. Both rhymes are not common and seem to be local versions.

Now for the songs:

Hopp Hopp zur Mölle (Mühle)

(Hop Hop to the mill)

Die Küster auf den Fölle (Fohlen)

(the sextons on the fillies)

Die Priester auf der bunten Kuh

(the priests on the pretty/colorful cow)

Hop Hop zur Mölle, Kuh.

(Hop Hop to the mill, cow)

----------------------

the other song:

So reiten die Herren

(So ride the Gentlemen, Men)

mit blanken gewären (Gewehren, Men)

(with drawn guns (""blank"" means ready to be used - usually ""blank ziehen"" = unsheathe))

mit blanken gewären (Gewehren)

(with drawn guns)

Sie reiten nach Polen

(they ride to Poland)


---// (doesn't sound like Poland would appreciate that visit though..)

----

I was able to find [this](http://archive.org/stream/germania22pfeiuoft/germania22pfeiuoft_djvu.txt):

So reiten die Herren, 

Mit blanken Gewehren, 

Mit blanken Pistolen, 

Sie reiten nach Polen.

----

Seems like a martial version of this (which is more common):

So fahren die Damen so fahren die Damen

so reiten die Herren so reiten die Herren

Nope. Actually I believe in Europe we have a solid racist majority. The standard is racist. Anyone being racist always defends themselves as some kind of minority, though. Maybe because they attack a minority? Dunno. But the usual line goes something like this: ""It has to be said, even though it goes against political correctness."" or ""no one is saying it, but everyone is thinking it"".

I wouldn't even know where to start. Let's start with the identity. While Germany is currently shitting itself over privacy concerns in the PRISM scandal, this guy wants to identify each and every person that walks in public. So ban motorcycle helmets? Surgical masks? Britain already has cameras in almost all public spaces. With facial recognition, Big Brother always knows where you are. Yet the burqa is suddenly a problem because of the identity? Really??

&gt; Furthermore, I wonder why it's never discussed why non-Muslim women feel compelled to wear headscarves in Muslim-majority countries. We always just give the situation a pass by saying, ""well, that's their culture; when in Rome""......Why can't THEY take the same accommodating attitude about OUR culture?

If you don't find the openly racist shit in this one, I can't help you. Well, maybe I can give you a hint: [You see all the headscarves on the beach in Égypt?](https://www.google.com/search?q=egypt+summer+vacation&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de:unofficial&amp;client=iceweasel-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=de&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=rmsYUsPrAsaQtAajnoDgAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=738&amp;sei=sGsYUry3EsLQtAazyYCgCg#fp=5e3e58997ec3e5f7&amp;hl=de&amp;q=egypt+beach+vacation&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de%3Aunofficial&amp;tbm=isch&amp;um=1)? That is because the whole idea that **all** Western women wear headscarves in Egypt is utter bullcrap. Just like the idea that all Egyptian women would to that. That applies to almost all Muslim countries. Also the headscarve is a trend that came back. You would not have found a single women in Kairo wearing one 40 years ago. And part of the reason why extreme religion surged in the past 20 years is because of Saudi Arabia, which was shielded from a secular Saddam Hussein by Operation Desert Storm. Yes, our influence is mostly responsible why Islam is such a strong force now in a lot of countries. But this goes a little far. I think this sentence already does it:

&gt; Why can't THEY take the same accommodating attitude about OUR culture?

Germany - Szczecin - Leba - Gdansk - Malbork - Ketrzyn - Suwalki - Lithuania. 

There are some good new roads but many, many bad ones where sometimes 60 kph is max. Even the motorways can have really bad patches. And deep in the countryside, you can even get stretches of ancient cobblestone where 30 kph is max. Not even the quality of the many graded dirt roads of Latvia or Estonia (60 kph to 80 kph), but roadbed made of rounded fieldstones, kilometers long.

Europe is the free, liberal place it is because we have become a secular society.   While I believe people should be able to practice their bizarre religious beliefs in their own churches or homes, they do not have an inherent right to whatever cultural practices they want in our society.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm not saying capitalism= feudalism. They are similar in some ways by hierarchy, but they are two distinct systems, and it's usually a better life for someone in capitalism than feudalism. However, I do not think capitalism is the ideal of a society, because inherent in it is the support of one upper class by the labour power of the working class, just as in feudalism, the aristocracy and monarchies were supported by the peasantry under them. In capitalism, those who toil and make the majority of wealth for those at the top now have a more comfortable standard of life than serfs did 3 centuries ago, but there are unnecessary problems that go with this. Large-scale recessions, economic crises, unemployment, homelessness, debt, etc.

Capitalism is a coercive system. One must near always be part of the system in order to survive in it. Goods must be paid for from a capitalist, land is owned by capitalists in the same way that fiefs owned and operated land under feudalism. And any working-class person must sell their labour at less than its value in order to have the chance of surviving in the system, while this makes money to the employer of this person. 


You continue claiming that most people are fine with capitalism. It is a biased system that serves one class minority from the labour of others. You seem to have this idea in your head that everyone of the ""villagers"" has an understanding of the system they live under. This often isn't true. Many in the west believe that capitalism is just ""the system"" and that is just how society is, no questions asked. Many will make complaints about how their hours are being cut down, how their standard of living is slowly diminishing, how the loaf of bread costs more than it used to, but the same amount of money is in their wallet, how the role of capital in government is ever increasing, but hardly ever does one have this correlated with the capitalist system. Those in the West live the best standard of life on Earth because their nations are the economic brutes of the world. Today, the dollar and the euro are the new tools of economic imperialism, rather than the rifle and the sabre.

The person in question feels fine with the system. Then his job is moved by the employer to a country where forming a labour union is illegal, where the wages of the workers are absolutely pitiful, where benefits and pensions don't exist, and where workplace safety laws are nonexistent.

Why is this person unemployed? Did he not work *hard enough?* He did his job every day, he was on time. Why did this happen to him? Because there was a way of circumnavigating the higher cost of having him as an employee. Good luck finding another job, buddy. You just didn't work hard enough.

What is he to do when private companies run by the upper class are slowly but surely directly interfering with the political spectrum and the way common law is done? In the US, a Supreme Court decision in 2010 affirmed corporate person-hood, along with their right to have large amounts of influence placed on elected officials who in turn represent their interests in their office. The profits of the mechanisms of the capitalist class continue their rise, while the living standard of the west falls.

It isn't like government assistance to private organisations is anything new. Don't forget the CEO of Halliburton was also chosen to be the second most powerful man in the US in 2000. One can even go back longer and talk about the invasions of central american nations to take control of arable land and plantations under western business interests. Not to mention all that Europe has done directly in the similar course for economic dominance. The Belgians in Congo, The French in North Africa, the British in India. Same plot, different story.

If they are living a comfortable existence, then they are fine, and will put up with things like falling wages, rising debts, unemployment and layoffs, and a wealth-gap. 

You bring up welfare, and you use it as a backing for capitalism. You don't bring up the way that welfare was almost always won and fought for; leftists getting the shit beaten out of them and jeopardizing their lives to get a shorter working day, a higher wage, and basic safety/workplace rights. People starved themselves, people were killed by the military and police, as well as thugs administered by respective companies. The welfare that we enjoy and take for granted today wasn't given to us because the benevolent invisible hand of the free market was looking out for the interests of the working class that day; it is because workers fought and died for their right to them.

Once the system's no longer sustainable, like French feudalism when it was overturned and violently replaced with the capitalist mode of production, one can see how happy the majority of the villagers are.",0,1377334386,null,0,1377334599,0,cbubug2,t3_1kxoza,t1_cbubug2,t1_cbubic7,null,1429717116,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

FACT: Tens of thousands of non-Muslims have been killed in sectarian violence in the Muslim realm over the last 15 years. We're not talking about wars, invasions, occupations. We're talking about inter-communal violence of people who live among each other. In Nigeria alone, over 10,000 Christians have been slaughtered in the last 15 years. In Indonesia, 5000 have been killed. In Egypt and Sudan, Christians are routinely discriminated against and even murdered. In Iran, Christians, Jews and Bahais are routinely arrested, persecuted, discriminated against and sometimes killed. In Pakistan and Indonesia, Ahmadis and Christians are persecuted and sometimes killed. In Pakistan and Malaysia, Hindus are discriminated against.

You attribute this systematic persecution of non-Muslims in the Islamic realm as ""some mob in god-knows-where""....because you have no conception of what the real world is. And you have the magnanimity to concede that they ""are even more racist than us."" How incredibly open-minded!

As for the ""racist"" Europe that you apparently despise, how many Muslims have been killed in inter-communal violence there over the last two decades? Any at all? 4 or 5 maybe? 10? 20?

I hope some day you'll break free of the conditioning and indoctrination that your educational institutions and your media have inflicted on you. Racism is the bogey-man, designed to silence anyone who dare utter uncomfortable truths about Islamic theology and tradition.

No, even with the new methods. A chair with four legs is less material efficient than a chair with three legs. However, a leg from a four-legged chair can go missing and you can still sit on it. That's not the case with three-legged chairs.

It's a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and robustness, you also see it in evolution. We have two kidneys, although one would be enough for most people. This is not efficient, but when one kidney fails we can fall back on the other. So it has other advantages.

I'll repeat that it's surely possible to design structures that have that redundancy built in, but those will still use more material than the most material-efficient structures.

There are also other disadvantages: if that efficiency depends on uniformity (eg. a honeycomb structure), then how will it be repaired? It's a hole in an existing building, you can't just reprint the whole thing.

He's been awarded the Nobel Peace Price, the  Presidential Medal of Freedom,the Congressional Gold Medal, and not to mention, India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan.

One of the main reasons he's famous is because of his work on **Genetically Modified Organisms**. And no, he wasn't the President or CEO of Monsanto. 

As for you're declaration that that the Western World doesn't need them and that GMOs are useless, look what the man himself has to say:

&gt;The limited potential for land expansion for cultivation worried Borlaug, who, in March 2005, stated that, ""we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."" With 85% of future growth in food production having to come from lands already in use, he recommends a multidisciplinary research focus to further increase yields, mainly through increased crop immunity to large-scale diseases, such as the rust fungus, which affects all cereals but rice. His dream was to ""transfer rice immunity to cereals such as wheat, maize, sorghum and barley, and transfer bread-wheat proteins (gliadin and glutenin) to other cereals, especially rice and maize"".

&gt;Borlaug believed that genetic manipulation of organisms (GMO) was the only way to increase food production as the world runs out of unused arable land. GMOs were not inherently dangerous ""because we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds.""

Your insistence on grouping Monsanto and GMOs together as if their synonymous shows me the only understanding of the entire situation you have is derived from mass media and Reddit, which by the way, GREAT SOURCES. lulz I mean....shouldn't you like...actually take the time out your day to research something you're arguing against? Because you know...not doing so isn't like...incredibly ignorant and dishonest... /s ;) 

Oh, and perhaps you would like to tell me about another famine on the same scale as Mao's Great Leap Forward or Stalin's Holodomor? The only one I can think is the British-induced one in India during WWII *(although I think it had less deaths than the above two, but there's a good chance I could be wrong on this)*.

&gt;Feeding people has little to do with availabilty of food in the modern world.

Whether we don't have enough food or whether we have a surplus, feeding people is always dependent on the availability of food. Your statement contradicts itself. 

But anyway, I get what you're saying. And at the present, you're right, we do have enough food *(mainly because of GMOs &amp; the Green Revolution)*. 

But the future? I'll let Mr. Borlaug give his own observation: 

&gt;The limited potential for land expansion for cultivation worried Borlaug, who, in March 2005, stated that, ""we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."" With 85% of future growth in food production having to come from lands already in use, he recommends a multidisciplinary research focus to further increase yields, mainly through increased crop immunity to large-scale diseases, such as the rust fungus, which affects all cereals but rice. His dream was to ""transfer rice immunity to cereals such as wheat, maize, sorghum and barley, and transfer bread-wheat proteins (gliadin and glutenin) to other cereals, especially rice and maize"".

&gt;Borlaug believed that genetic manipulation of organisms (GMO) was the only way to increase food production as the world runs out of unused arable land. GMOs were not inherently dangerous ""because we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds.""

Equal representation sucks so much ass. Something more along the lines of weighted voting like in the Council of the European Union or the distribution of votes in the Bundesrat would be better. This would be somewhere in between the two. It ensures that individual states' interests can be addressed thoroughly, without giving Malta the same power as Germany.

The UK doesn't have much leverage in many aspects of EU governance because it's more Euroskeptic than any other member state and isn't in the Eurozone. It does, however have more influence than every country in foreign policy, save for France.

Spain and Italy aren't really leaders in the way that France and Germany are. They're not powerful enough on the world stage to significantly alter foreign policy, nor are they financially stable or rich enough to push France and Germany aside.

Proportional representation in the Upper as well as the Lower House would just give California excessive influence in the government. You have to remember, California is only 1 in 50 states.

The problem is that the American Senate is an incredibly powerful upper house, relative to most. The House of Lords has basically no power, the French Senate is fairly weak, and the Bundesrat (one of the most powerful upper houses in Europe) is only slightly stronger. The Senate isn't a problem only for California. California is just the biggest victim. All the other big states suffer too.

&gt;Proportional representation in the Upper as well as the Lower House would just give California excessive influence in the government. You have to remember, California is only 1 in 50 states.

I don't advocate for PR in a hypothetical European Senate. I'd be fine with weighted voting like it currently exists in the Council of the EU. California is 1 of 50 states, but Californians are 1 of 8 Americans. The Senate and the electoral college disenfranchise citizens in the big states and empower the citizens of the smaller states. My vote is less powerful than a voter in Wyoming. It defies the idea that my vote is equal to everyone else's. More than half of the country lives in the ten most populous states. This means that more than 50% of the population is represented by only 20% of the Senate. I do think that individual states need some sort of representation, but the Senate it its current incarnation is a gross violation of modern notions of democratic government and political equality.",0,1377347336,null,0,false,0,cbudfru,t3_1kzvlv,t1_cbudfru,t1_cbudb0r,null,1429716301,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Now while I do agree that it should be reduced to 5 years, I think this serves as a good counter-balance to the short 2.5 year terms that Representatives in the house are afforded. There is a benefit, I believe, in that longer time when it comes to deliberation and debating long-term benefits and drawbacks of legislation, as compared to the Representatives who would, theoretically, be more focused on the short-term because of..well..their shorter terms. Although this is my personnel opinion. 

&gt;pork being distributed to senators from poor or smaller states in order to win their vote on unrelated issues.

&gt;wasteful military projects which can't be canceled because the senators from the states which are involved in building the project, are opposed.

Once again, like to remind you that distribution of ""pork"" (which I don't really understand what you mean) and wasteful military projects are not inherrent to the structure of the legislature. But moving past that and acknowleding your arguments, even though I disagree with them in this context:

So one argument is that Senators are distracted by issues unrelated to their state, but another one of your arguments is that Senators are too focused on their own state? Also, don't all elected officials look out for the interests of their constituents...I mean somebody elected from Germany would look out for German interests....they are elected *representatives* mind you. 

&gt;corporate lobbies which concentrate around senator offices

Once again, lobbying is not inherent to the U.S.-system. It is inherent to U.S. politics. There is a difference. Like you said, many countries have bicameral legislatures, and I think the U.S.-style one is rather efficient, especially in a case like the EU. I gurantee you that you can find just as many issues with certain country's who have Westminister-style systems as you can with America. 

I just think a American-style bicamarel legislature would serve the interests of Europe, and it's constituent members, better than a Westminister-style one, specifically because it balances the interests of the larger states with the interests of the smaller states, allowing a avenue for the larger states' larger influence to be reflected, while also preserving the smaller states' voice.

Let's take a few specific examples: 

1. ""Poorly qualified and trained staff"". How exactly does this slow down the effects of cutting wages on competitiveness? It doesn't. How exactly does it slow down the effect of closing down schools and hospitals on the budget? It doesn't. 

2. ""Ineffective procedures"". How would having better procedures help with gathering more taxes, when the people just don't have any money to pay them? 

You just use the word ""reforms"" like it's a magic pill and then keep repeating they're necessary even though you have no mechanism to explain how these measures help with anything.

The fact is that my comment betrays no such lack of knowledge about the EU but a historical view that compromises and power consolidation at some levels are a natural growth feature for a large and diverse government. 

Your examples in this thread completely focus on the negatives of this style and completely ignores the much more serious negatives of other styles. 

What of a population based representation across the board?  How will smaller nations agree to it without compromising on at least a partial house which grants a minimum representation?  

And will no executive or a shared executive cabinet be able to effectively curtail lobbying?  Will lobbying not exist just because the targets shift to members of parliament with even fewer regulators watching?

How would the EU handle pork projects without influential politicians from smaller regions?  Will all military, space exploration, and government facilities be simply built in regions with the highest populations or will they simply make after the election coalitions and still distribute pork in an even more convoluted system?  

Your arguments are very untested and weak. The most compelling, however is why have almost every example of a large scale government in history tended towards power consolidation and why would an EU government be different?

I wager that Greece has a much better standard of living than Mississippi. Greece's problems are of its own making and only the Greek people can solve them.

EU doesn't have a debt crisis either (just look at the currency strength for proof). You probably mean Greece and Cyprus. All other countries are coming along.

If you mean to say Stalinist with what you mean, then you should probably know that Stalin pushed himself and lied about his relationship with members, especially Lenin himself. When an opposition to him was made in the party, he'd already made an effective control group among him and a few others. 

Within a few years, Stalinist control on the party, and Comintern, was cemented. Almost every other Marxist Leninist state was directly influenced by the Soviet model via the Cominform, and later  Comecon.  Stalinist elements of most Leninist partoes arose in many of these countries, especially those under Soviet occupation in East Europe.

Internationally speaking, many Soviet friendly leaders ascended to power, such as Fidel in Cuba. Che Guevara wasn't a big fan of Soviet bloc, mostly due to the stalinist elements of it.
