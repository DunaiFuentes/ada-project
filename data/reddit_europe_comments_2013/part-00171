true,EnUnLugarDeLaMancha,ESPA,Spain,"The EU could be doomed, but it would be incomprehensible if we let it happen. The fact is, it was very well know that the adoption of Euro would get Europe to this situation. It was know that the Euro would cause troubles and that at some point the EU had to advance, so it would be surprising if some country suddenly backed off.

There are different ways the north/south unbalance could get balanced. Massive infrastructure investing can create jobs, but it's not necessarily the best tool. First of all, infrastructure investment is a keynesian thing that is used to stimulate demand in a normal country with a sane monetary policy, the EU and the Euro are very different. Infrastructure investment in the south would improve the economy for a while, but it wouldn't erase the huge imbalances and it wouldn't address the root problems of the Euro. Also, it wouldn't make manufacturing more productive by itself (I doubt these days there are big ""productivity black holes"" caused by lack of roads, bridges or airports in southern countries), specially if stimulus translates into wage growth and inflation.

The right (and only) way to solve the euro problems is to create a fiscal union, let the Brussels government pay the basic government spending (pensions benefits, healthcare, education) with tax revenues from all the countries. But right now this would effectively mean that Germany and France would pay the government spending of other countries. Also (and IMO much more important), the healthcare, education, pension policies would be set by the Brussels parliament, not by the national parliaments. The mindset change needed is huge, and nobody is sure that Europe is ready for it.

An indirect temporary workaround would be to encourage slight wage growth in countries like Germany. Let germans buy more stuff from southern countries, let germans buy more stuff from german companies who buy some of their materials from southern countries, let euro fall slightly against the dollar, let germany move its trade surplus to a balance. It also would be a popular policy in Germany after a decade of a trade surplus created with the help of wage restraint.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Do you mean government spending as % of gdp? Well, Sweden, Finland, France, and the UK have you beat.

The data you presented is old and nevertheless it represents the excessive weight of the public sector in the economy, not to mention that Portugal applies its public funds in a much more inefficient way.

&gt;Yes, Portugal's public debt as a percent of GDP is one of the highest in the EU right now. But it was lower than France's in 2006 and lower than Germany's in 2007.

Which is wholly irrelevant as we're living in the present. And you can't look only at the public debt as a percentage of GDP, you must also look at the capacity of the state to levy taxes in order to pay for its expenses, and the Portuguese tax burden is already higher than that of France or Germany and, unlike these countries, we're experiencing phenomenons such as emigration of young and highly-skilled workers, which certainly will have quite negative consequences in the future, which is raising our interest rates above these countries.

&gt;Why is it skyrocketing now? That's a little complicated, but it basically comes down to this: the ECB isn't printing enough Euros to get Portugal out of its debt trap.

Hah! What a joke! Instead of cutting public expenditures, we should just print more money, wow, what a genius plan, I wonder why nobody ever tried that before!

&gt;You're really buying into the having cake and eating it too politics of the EU. When you need help, they're foreign. When they need help, you're their brothers. They see it the opposite.

What do you mean by that? The relations are bilateral, just like we expect that the money we spent on Greece to be paid back, we must expect that we pay back the money the rest of the EU loaned us.

&gt;Plus, you don't really need the ""foreign help"" as you put it. I guess what you mean is cash bailouts to recapitalize Portuguese banks to pay off bondholders.

Our banks don't need to be recapitalised. It's our state the one that can't keep its expenditures in accordance to its revenue.

&gt;Without the foreign help, you could just default and rebuild like Iceland has successfully done.

viene esteso ai delitti di maltrattamenti contro famigliari e conviventi il ventaglio delle ipotesi di arresto in flagranza;
si prevede che in presenza di gravi indizi di colpevolezza di violenza sulle persone o minaccia grave e di serio pericolo di reiterazione di tali condotte con gravi rischi per le persone, il Pubblico Ministero – su informazione della polizia giudiziaria - può richiedere al Giudice di irrogare un provvedimento inibitorio urgente, vietando all’indiziato la presenza nella casa familiare e di avvicinarsi ai luoghi abitualmente frequentati dalla persona offesa.

true,Tech_Itch,FINL,Finland,"&gt;But it seems like rejecting those crazy conditions doesn't require formal collectivization like unions, it might (should?) work if employees, individually but in significant enough numbers, tell their management that they are unsatisfied with the conditions.

Employers don't have to make an example of that many people to have a chilling effect on people's willingness to protest their working conditions. 

Part of it is also, I think, psychology of reward and punishment. According to studies, if people are offered the choice of a small reward now, or substantially larger reward later, most people will take the smaller reward, since the larger one seems so far away, and therefore uncertain. This applies to collective bargaining without an organization to back you up: People will want to avoid getting fired *now*, even if they would have better pay and working conditions *later*, if they protested. Combine this with many people not having the luxury of not working, and this creates a chilling effect, that can't be fought without organized collective bargaining.


&gt;From my external perspective, it seems more likely that at-will employment is to blame, as it's extremely easy for the employer to get rid of anyone they don't like, and they can afford to do so as long as someone out there is willing to work in those worse conditions.

Yes, and at-will employment(an excellently Orwellian name there) is one of the, what I would consider, loopholes. Since firing people is so easy, nobody will fight for their rights. What makes this so Orwellian is that people are kept under the impression that they and the employer are on equal footing when making an employment contract, when in fact they typically have much more to lose than their employer.",0,1376843130,null,0,false,0,cbqa8eu,t3_1klsfs,t1_cbqa8eu,t1_cbq9mew,null,1429786242,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Very good question.

Mostly because the average worker is quite disposable in a country of 300+ million. If a group of people refuse to work under certain conditions, more than likely there are many hundreds would be happy to in exchange for a steady paycheck.

&gt;Do you feel that you would be unable to get (or keep) any job if you did that? Or do you feel the rest of the society would negatively judge you for not working hard enough?

A little of both. Unfortunately there is still a small stigma associated with more than 2 weeks a year off work (sometimes even associated with maternity/paternity leave). Even though evidence mostly shows that more time off increases a worker's productivity and creativity this information is yet to become mainstream in the red white and blue.

Chissà perchè, penso sia l'idea comune di stato di vulnerabilità... non esiste solo la dicotomia uomo-donna.  

Oh, guarda, sulla vulnerabilità lo stato italiano concorda con me, sembrerebbe:  
&gt;L’ordinamento italiano non conosce il concetto, di matrice europea, di «soggetto vulnerabile», tratto direttamente dal dizionario francese (dove viene riferito agli adulti: adultes vulnérables). E, infatti, sfogliando le norme scolpite nel libro I del codice civile, in tema di interdizione ed inabilitazione, si percepisce immediatamente che il substrato semantico in cui sfociano le misure di protezione degli adulti “vulnerabili” è quello della incapacità o della infermità, quali connotazioni legate a doppio filo con la malattia mentale ed i disturbi fisici o psichici invalidanti (in linea con il concetto anglosassone di “incapacitated adults”).

The gorilla breaks free, and everybody runs except an old lady thinking 'that'll be the day' and a judge thinking he's safe for being male.

However, you must not forget to make the distinction between these schools, foreign (often less -) religious schools and religious education on it's own.

My school for example is officially religious, but in Holland that means it is not much more than a school where religion is fully accepted. Only half the student go to church, and the education it self is not affected by beliefs at all since the government decides the matter.

Religion classes are mandatory, but they are not only about religion. Most of it is actually philosophy, along with knowledge about foreign religions.

In the end I think this kind of system provides a very open and acceptant environment for everyone regardless of your religion, orientation (in any field) or behaviour. You know why?

Ho capito solo ora. Significa che se ti rivolgi a un giudice per un caso di violenza domestica non paghi le spese processuali, e non le paghi neanche se l'accusa è falsa (qui è il riferimento alla presunzione di innocenza [riferimento molto leggero, c'è da dirlo]). In poche parole, se una donna si inventa una violenza domestica da parte del coniuge/compagno, non paga le spese processuali che finiscono a carico dei contribuenti direttamente, e il gratuito patrocinio (così si chiama questa norma) parte sin dall'inizio del processo, ovvero è a carico dei contribuenti.

I think you'd find that Scandinavia is not so different from any other western region. I do not really know what you expect. It's not like you get paid for doing nothing, you have to work to get welfare.

&gt; Not sure if I could sacrifice having a good conversation with a stranger or giving a random guy a ride to the store for a being a part of such an economically fair country.

The thing is that *most Swedes* (there are exceptions of course) don't like talking a lot to strangers. They would feel you were intruding their personal space, and you'd be the one that is rude. :P If it makes any sense... We make friends through work, school, sports or other social gatherings.

I mean there is no way to measure if a country's people are cold or not, but if you want to read a [long report by EU](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-58-04-998/EN/KS-58-04-998-EN.PDF) you can see that Scandinavians spend more time socialising with friends and family than other European countries. We do also visit friend's homes more, but that might be more due to the climate than anything else.

I think many English native speakers also assume that just because Scandinavians can speak English, they do not have learn the language their residing in. That's a mistake because it can be tiresome and boring to socialise in English (it's not very easy to be funny in a second language...).

I hope that you don't find this synonymous with economically progressive, or why American progressives admire the Nordic safety net. Equal opportunity through social mobility (be it through education, healthcare, or working conditions). Many of us are one major illness, or a college degree away from financial ruin. So many people are at the mercy of their connections, charities, or families.

&gt;Scandinavians spend more time socializing with friends and family than other European countries

Yes, that is quite common knowledge. But, does this apply also to non native Swedish speakers?

&gt;I think many English native speakers also assume that just because Scandinavians can speak English, they do not have learn the language their residing in. 

I agree with you. Not sure why many feel they are exempt from this basic rule. Quite frankly, it's not a lot to ask.

&gt;Hope I could fill in some gaps here, but I have never lived outside of Sweden so I base my ""knowledge"" on experience from meeting other foreigners who have decided to move to Sweden.

Yes you did. Do many immigrants (particularly native English speakers) move to Sweden and make friends? Or are they seen as more of a nuisance?

Well, if you are interest edin how it all began, Wikipedia surprisingly has an article on it: [Greek Language Question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language_question). 

It doesn't tackle any of the modern issues, rather focusing on the now settled debate of ""Should we speak Greek as it is now or should we create up a con-lang based on Ancient Greek and use that instead?"", and maybe that's for the better, because nowadays the 'questions' are way too embarrassing: people insisting that Modern Greek has 7 vowels just because they are seven symbols in the alphabet that are called vowels, people insisting that omega sounds different than omicron when in fact they are perceiving the difference between a stressed and an unstressed syllable and then you have theories which involve aliens and/or computers using Greek as their low-level programming language because Greek is more ""meaning-oriented"" and is capable of expressing ""inner truths"". Sometimes those hoaxes make it into school exam questions too.

Great explanation.

&gt; But, does this apply also to non native Swedish speakers?

To be honest, I do not know. I have lived in a dorm with other Europeans (Germans, Spaniards) and they seemed to live pretty much exactly like we Swedes did. They were on exchange though, so it was pretty chill for them study wise.

&gt; Do many immigrants (particularly native English speakers) move to Sweden and make friends? Or are they seen as more of a nuisance?

I know to little to make an informed statement, but if I make some generalisations:
 
* Exchange students usually hang out with other exchange students, but I've understood it's like that everywhere.
* If someone speaks bad Swedish it's of course not as fun to be with them, so then maybe they'd be seen as irritating.

Germans take recycling rather serious, so you want to pay attention to where you dispose of your trash and how. Ask your landlord or the municipality about the details, it's rather complex.

It should go without saying that ignorance about WW2 or even jokes about Hitler and the Nazis are not appreciated at all.  

As mentioned below, it's rather hard to offend Germans, but rather easy vice-versa. ;) Expect to see much more nudity and a more laid-back attitude towards sexuality than in the US. 
Also, a large minority in Germany is agnostic/atheist or doesn't attend church except for Christmas and maybe Easter. Religion is not a big part of everyday life, and many will not like to discuss theirs at all.
Furthermore, Germans do not like small-talk much and would rather get to the point in a conversation as quickly as possible. In comparison, there is not as much polite chit-chat as in the US, and not as many ""please""'s and ""thank you""'s.

So if you stick to the fairly obvious things like ""don't be loud"" and ""don't be late"", you should be OK, although maybe you'll have to also ask yourself whether you're willing not to be offended too easily. :-)

Basically, people aren't idiots: they're aware that social customs vary from place to place and are willing to make allowances for someone who's visibly a foreigner.  And social differences between countries (esp. Western countries) are often exaggerated to the point of being a cliché.

* Be on time, or be prepared to get a stern talking to.  
* Don't cross the street if the sign isn't telling you to. Doesn't matter if there isn't a car in sight, you're gonna get the stink eye.  
* Don't make Nazi jokes. Just please. Don't. I saw so many other Americans doing this and it made me physically cringe.  
* I don't know how many Turkish people would be in your area, but try and figure out the relationships between the Germans and locals of other nationalities. Understanding the German-Turkish relations REALLY made a lot of stuff make sense when I was in Berlin.  
* Try ALL the beer while you're there, especially if you drink the piss-water that is American macros. German hefes are my faves.  
* Don't be loud and obnoxious.  
* Don't be one of those people who does the whole ""Well in *America* we do it *this* way..."" type people.

I've had a lot of big arguments over things ranging from taxi drivers trying to rip me off (once was talking on the *phone* about how dumb I was, thinking I didn't understand him) to the everpresent Roma issues, but the worst is the way Romanians see the way others see them. They think everyone hates them because of their gypsies flooding the rest of Europe. It's a tiring argument.

This has been discussed a lot in Sweden, and actually the breeding programs are slowly changing, and it is getting discussed - a lot. However, there's a lot of problems of course, there is always very difficult to change the attitudes, but it has certainly started. I'd say it is like a big ship - the ship has not turned yet, but we, dog lovers in Sweden has started to turn the stering wheel, and the ship is slowly following. 

&gt;Are there any known breeds from your country that are properly bred with a focus on their health (or at least not fashion)

Yes, most of our national dog breeds actually. With that I mean that they are fairly healthy and mostly focused on performance/temperament, not looks. A bit of it is perhaps due to the fact that the bad side effects of dog breeding have been on the agenda for at least two decades, but a lot has to do with the fact that the Swedish breeds mostly are working dogs and if they work you focus more on performance than looks. Here are some of our Swedish dogs.

In Sweden it has been brought up by the Swedish Veterinarian Association (which have had a huge impact), and by different groups of dog owners. Many of them are subgroups to the Swedish Dogowners Association (Svenska Kennelklubben). Now it is up on *their* agenda too (whether they want it not)., which is a good thing.

We who live in Western countries tend to think that every other Western country is sort of a mirror image of our own... and that's not actually true.

That can be a very daunting realization. 

If a person is young, culture shock can be particularly hard on him or her, because his sense of his place in the world as an adult isn't fully developed yet.

Well, maybe not necessarily how it *should* be (too conservative), but Switzerland is much closer to the German stereotype people from non-German speaking countries tend to have than Germany itself. As you said, better organized, better public transport, I'd say it's cleaner too, plus it actually delivers on the mountainous aspect. The Swiss work more, too. And while I find the whole emphasis on Swissness in Switzerland a bit over the top, having a bold white cross anywhere on a red area of product packaging almost automatically looks well designed.

true,michaeladams94,null,null,"So this is coming from a German who has lived close to five years in Birmingham, AL who originally is from an Area near Cologne (not too far away from where you're heading) and here are a couple of things you will need to know:

1. If you are from the bible belt, be prepared that most German teenagers are NOT very religious and tend to have a humor that would be considered borderline-blasphemy in the US

2. Germans in your age group (assuming you are around 20 years old) tend to have a lot of slang words that might be difficult to understand (often they use abstract interpretations of just regular words. Example: ""Bauarbeiter-dekoltee"" = ""Streetworker cleavage"" which means as much as the part of a buttcrack you get to see when people sag their pants and bend over)

3. Don't hesitate to ask questions or ask people to repeat themselves if you didn't quite understand them - they want to converse with you.

4. Germans tend to appear a lot more dismissive toward people they don't know. It will happen rarely that you get to see random people asking you how you are doing or people holding the door for each other. It is a really nice gesture to hold the door open to older people, but try to avoid the etiquette of small talk about meaningless things with random people, they will just see it as a waste of their time.

5. As already mentioned, when eating out, it is not very usual when you tip large amounts. If you only pay for yourself, many people just put a Euro or two on the table for tip and if you pay for a small group, they round up to the next round number (5s or 0s). Tipping a lot is not a bad thing, though.

6. Do NOT (for the love of god, DON'T EVER) make Hitler / Nazi / Jew / WW2 jokes. You will not make ANY friends because German culture has become a lot about learning from mistakes made by previous governments. Everyone knows the history of the Holocaust in gutwrenching detail, so cracking a joke will be picked up as you disrespecting all the innocent people having died in WW2.

7. We do not hate the French regardless of what you've been told.

8. As stated by others, the subject of Turkish immigrants is very touchy and it is best to avoid any kind of discussion, because some people have grown rather hostile towards immigrants during the financial crisis and a target group has always been the Turkish. Just try to avoid that subject and treat all the people you encounter with the same level of respect.

9. If things are done differently in Germany, you may point out that you've learned them in a different fashion back home (Example would be that most people down here in Alabama barely ever use a knife while Germans usually keep their knife in their right hand to somewhat scoop their food onto the fork to eat), but at least give a shot at doing it the way it is done where you're staying. If you fail, you can always go back to your habits, but the mere fact that you tried is something that will give you a lot of bonus points with people.

10. Try to learn a couple of common phrases and even have an attempt at learning our language. Just saying ""Guten Tag, wie geht's Ihnen(/dir)?"" (""Hello (Literal: What a lovely day), how're you doing?) will show the people that you appreciate their culture and you are willing to adapt to it.

11. You will notice that in public, people tend to speak a little more quietly than in the US, especially in Restaurants. Try to adjust to that noise level.

12. Try our Beer and wine, it's something we're proud of!

13. When it comes to dating, it is not uncommon that girls ask guys out, so be prepared for it. Also, being the typical ""Gentleman"" is not quite as common as it is in the US and gender roles are a little different here when it comes to dating - difficult to explain, you'll get the hang of it.

14. When it comes to traffic, there are two MAJOR differences between here and the US. First of all, there is NO right on red. DON'T EVER JUST MAKE A RIGHT TURN ON A RED LIGHT. IT'S A TRAFFIC VIOLATION. And secondly, 4-way intersections only rarely have stop signs. The rule in Germany is the ""Rechts vor links "" (right before left) rule. If you are trying to cross an intersection, and there is a guy to your right, you have to let him pass first. If there is a guy to your left, he will have to let you pass first. There are certain traffic signs that mark the exceptions to this rule, so please get a closer look at that before you leave.

15. No free refills on sodas in Restaurants. Sorry. I know, it hurts.

16. Be on time. It is very unpolite to be late in most situations because it conveys the message that you didn't care enough to make sure you would arrive on time. Only time you can be late is when you hang out with friends, but then try not to be much later than twenty minutes late.

17. Try to get used to the metric system. The earlier you get used to it, the better.

18. Last, but not least: Have fun. I've lived through the culture clash for 5 years now, and I don't regret having made this decision for a single second. Don't forget that life is also about being able to enjoy yourself, so have a safe trip and don't get into trouble.

(on a final note: Cops in Germany are also a lot more laid back than cops in the US, and as far as I know, public intoxication is not against any laws as long as you behave adequately)

EDIT: Some more points from other posts I want to add that didn't come to mind while I was brainstorming for this:

1. Recycling is a lot bigger here than it is in the US. Always try to separate organic matter, plastic, paper and metal, and Pfandflaschen (For most bottles, you get money back called ""Pfand"" when you bring them back to the store, kind of an incentive to recycle because you had to pay that ""Pfand"" on top of the initial price when you originally bought the bottles)

2. Americans have a tendency to be quick about calling people their ""best friends"" or saying things like ""I miss you"" or ""I love you"" compared to Germans. Try to be discrete when using those kinds of phrases. Also, don't make promises you can't hold such as ""We should totally go to the movies together"" because people will think you're much more serious than they do in the US, and it will make for some awkward situations to say the least if you try doing this with Germans.

3. Germans don't like David Hasselhoff all that much. He's just an actor who happened to sing some song at some historical event. Not like people actually associated him standing on the wall singing with the hassle (pun intended) that it took to re-unite Germany.

An hour's flight between Stockholm and Latvia is nothing. Distances get even more amazing from within Latvia. In a 4 hour drive from the capital, you could reach 4 different countries (Lithuania, Estonia, Russia and Belarus). And possibly make it to Poland in under 5 hour. And yes, it's amazing how language changes over such small distances. A couple hundred kilometers to Estonia, and as soon as I cross the border I won't understand a word.

Well, I'm definitely happy so far. I got what I wanted from a move to Sweden. Mainly - and this is something hard to explain to North Americans and many Europeans - to live in a society that has not been a police state or authoritarian lately. This might seem unusual to Americans, but many Europeans living today were born in authoritarian regimes. Actual Soviet countries, non-Soviet communist dictatorships (like Romania), Franco's dictatorship in Spain or Tito's Yugoslavia. Countries that haven't experienced authoritarianism for at least a couple of generations feel different.

Wenn Amerika sich dazu entscheidet ein paar richtige Drohnen über *unseren* Luftraum zu senden, wäre das schon relativ gefährdent für die Bundesrepublik (oder ein bisschen realistischer, Sanktionen und Probleme in der internationalen Politik, die man auch als ""gefährdent"" einstufen könnte). Abgesehen davon sind die anderen zwei Links doch relativ präzise. Luftaufnahmen sind bei Militäreinrichtungen illegal und beim Dagger Komplex handelt es sich um eine solche.

&gt;Die spannende Frage ist, für wen sie gefährlich sind. Aber wenn Du einer Regierung vertraust die Dich anlügt, dann findest Du das wahrscheinlich gar nicht so spannend.

Stimmt. Ganz real betrachtet, was genau könnte uns ein Staat wie Deutschland vorenthalten? Wir haben keine großflächigen internationalen Konflikte, die Wirtschaft scheint in Mitten von Trümmerhaufen zu halten und politisch bewegen wir uns auf einer übersichtlichen Schiene. Ich sehe keine potenziell, mein Leben verändernde Geheimnisse für die es Wert wäre in den Knast zu gehen. Ist weder Brasilien, noch Ägypten, Ostblock oder Syrien hier. Vielleicht hast du natürlich Recht und unsere Politiker, oder wen auch immer du beschuldigst, sind so gut im Lügen, dass man garnicht merkt wie sie... nun ja. Was genau? Wie auch immer. Ich finds spitze hier und werd mich erstmal nicht beschweren.

&gt;Aha. Wenn die Polizei also jedes Jahr 1000 Leute verprügelt und nur 50 davon willkürlich, dann siehst Du da keinen Handlungsbedarf.

Nicht ganz. Ich glaube du müsstest dich noch einmal über die Funktion der Polizei informieren. Denn Wenn die Polizei jedes Jahr tausende Vergewaltiger, Mörder und Diebe festnimmt und dabei nur [85 Kugeln abschießen](http://rt.com/usa/us-germany-85-shots-022/), bin ich damit glücklich und finde es gleichzeitig lächerlich von Polizeigewalt zu reden. Und wenn dann mal tatsächlich jemand aus versehen zur falschen Zeit am falschen Ort war und ungerecht von der Polizei behandelt wurde, finde ich das natürlich auch schlecht. Aber von unprovokantem Verhalten kann man in unserem OP-Artikel ja auch nicht reden.

&gt;Ich könnte Dir ja noch ein paar Beispiele raussuchen, in denen erwiesenermaßen (mit richterlichem Urteil) die Gewalt von der Polizei ausging, aber das tust Du ja auch nur wieder als bedauerliche Einzelfälle ab und bist froh, daß Du nicht in Ägypten wohnst.

Könntest du machen, ich glaube dir auch so. Nicht jeder Polizeieinsatz kann 100% perfekt ablaufen und manche gehen total daneben. Aber ja, sonst bin ich relativ glücklich dass ich grad nicht in Egypten wohne, wo die Polizei mich für meine Glaubensrichtung und politische Einstellung abknallen kann. Da kann ich wohl froh sein hier nur mit downvotes und nicht mit Kugeln durchsiebt werde hahaha.

&gt;Wenn ein US-Bürger also dagegen demonstriert, daß regelmäßig Haustiere abgeknallt werden und er dafür getazert wird, dann ist das in Deinen Augen in Ordnung so, weil diese Probleme eine Mücke im Vergleich zu den Problemen der indischen Straßenkinder ist.

Nein, wenn eine Gruppe (oder meinetwegen auch ein einzelner) U.S Bürger völlig legal und offiziell gegen das beschriebene Beispiel demonstrieren würde, wäre ich mit Leib und Seele dabei (wenn es in der nähe wäre). Aber stattdessen zum Pentagon zu rennen und mit einer Spielzeugdrohne Fotos davon zu schießen nur um die Polizei zu mobilisieren und zu sagen ""Ha! Polizeigewalt allewo, ich bin im Recht!"" ist ziemlich schwach. Und verdreh mir nicht die Worte im Mund, das hier hat nichts mit armen indischen Kindern zu tun und das weisst du auch. So habe ich nie wirklich argumentiert und das benutzt du jetzt seit zwei Posts als Zufluchtspunkt um meine Argumentation durch den Kakao zu ziehen, obwohl es nichtmal zum Thema passt. Den Menschen hier geht es größtenteils gut und jetzt die Polizei für jeden Deppen mobilisieren zu müssen, der Angst hat die NSA hätte seinen Pornographie-Ordner gefunden finde ich es lohnt sich einfach nicht. Das ist so die Schlagzeile der vergangenen Monate aber ich fand es einfach nicht schockierend. Vielleicht ist das der Knackpunkt in unserer Diskussion hier.

&gt;Er hat demonstriert, wie überempfindlich der Staat ist, wenn man ihm in die Karten gucken will. Kann man gar nicht oft genug machen. Aber Du willst ihm ja gar nicht in die Karten gucken. Die werden schon nicht gezinkt sein, hat er ja selber gesagt, und warum sollte er denn lügen, er spielt ja nicht mit gezinkten Karten.

Soweit ich das weiss, werden in Kneipen Leuten die beim in die Karten schauen erwischt die Hände abgehackt (Vorsicht! Metaphorisch gemeint). Er kann danach fragen und wenn der Kartenspieler meint die Information ist gerechtfertigt und soll für alle zugänglich sein, kann er das machen. Aber gewisse Staatsgeheimnisse bleiben nun mal Staatsgeheimnisse. Als Staat würde ich auch verhindern wollen dass alle Bürger in meinem Land, zu denen auch welche gehören könnten die mit schlechtes wollen oder meine Daten an dritte weitergeben könnten, wissen wo ich wann große Summen Geld transportiere, welche Terrorgruppen in welchen Gebieten ich suche oder wie viel ich von gefährlichen Bürgern weiss. Das ist nun mal die Realität.

&gt;Abgesehen davon ist es völlig egal, was diese Aktion erreicht hat. Demonstrationen sind nicht weniger legitim oder legal wenn sie nichts bringen.

Wie gesagt, sie ist legitim aber meiner Meinung nach sinnfrei. Ich kann auch für jeden Mist demonstrieren und damit komplett kleinkariert die Polizei auf den Plan rufen, tu es aber nicht. Er sollte sich lieber sinnvolleren Aktionen wenden, wie dem mobilisieren einer richtigen Demonstration, einer Bürgerinnitiative oder was auch immer. Was er tut ist nicht demonstrieren, sondern Polizei von A nach B rufen und die Zeit aller beteiligten verschwenden.

true,ArcticNano,ENGL,England,"Most rockets, like the previously mentioned Ariane 5, are pretty reliable and secure. The problem with the cost is mainly to do with rocket design in general. No rockets can be re-used, as the spent stages (usually) fall down into the sea/burn up in the atmosphere. This is hugely expensive-imagine the cost of a flight in a Boeing 747 if you had to discard the plane after use and build it entirely from scratch.

Now to make rockets reusable we need to find a way to return them to the ground safely, efficiently and relatively close to the launch site. [Spacex is currently researching this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4edoIbvJNY), but they are still a long way from getting an entire falcon 9 first stage from the upper atmosphere back to the launchpad. As you can imagine, this is monumentally challenging, as the stage is already on a trajectory away from the launchpad, so large manoeuvres will need to be made. However, achieving this with re-usable stages would lower costs dramatically.

Another way of lowering costs would be to use a Single Stage To Orbit spaceplane, or an SSTO. This means that no staging would be used, meaning they only have to get a single stage back to earth in order to make it fully re-usable. Most designs so far have used a hybrid method to try and acheive this. Firstly, jet engines and wings are used to provide lift and the fast speeds necessary to reach orbit while in the atmosphere, while using very little fuel in comparison to rockets. When the atmosphere thins, the rocket engines fire, lifting the plane out of the atmosphere and performing the orbital insertion burn. While in theory this is a good idea, most designs this far have never been tested, mainly due to one problem: weight.

The reason this does not really work so well in practice is because those engines are essentially dragging dead weight after a certain point. The jet engines not only have to carry themselves, but also all the rocket engines *and* all the fuel for the rockets. When the jet engines go out, The rockets have to carry the jet engines *and* a bunch of empty tanks. Staging on conventional rockets is used to drop these empty tanks, because they are just dead weight. Carrying them makes no sense. The wings must also be carried, even though they are completely useless.

HOWEVER. These problems can be solved, and British company Reaction Engines are designing a new engine specifically for SSTOs, called the [SABRE](http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/sabre.html). This engine essentially combines both rocket and jet engine into one that can be switched between both modes mid-flight. This would eradicate the need for two types of engines in an SSTO, dropping weight considerably. The plane they are designing to go with the SABRE engines is called the [skylon](http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/space_skylon.html), and would have a payload to leo of 15 tons and reduce costs by orders of magnitudes.

While those are both quite far-in-the future plans, esa is developing the Ariane 6. This rocket is specifically designed to reduce costs, and will hopefully lead the way for more European space exploration.",0,1376869996,null,0,false,0,cbqiq3l,t3_1kkv1n,t1_cbqiq3l,t1_cbq5ox3,null,1429782267,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,balanceofpain,null,null,"Der Artikel ist zu Recht nicht freigegeben worden, und es ist perfide von Niggemeier, wenn er der *taz*-Chefredakteurin politische Motive andichtet, und dabei so tut, als wäre Füller frei davon.  Wahrscheinlich hat er den Artikel gar nicht gelesen.  Es ist vollkommen idiotisch, von einer Partei zu verlangen, eine Anlaufstelle für Opfer sexuellen Missbrauchs einzurichten, nur weil sie ihre Wählerschaft aus einem Milieu bezieht, in dem es neben vielen anderen Spinnern auch einige Befürworter der Legalisierung pädosexueller Handlungen gab, da diese Partei *niemals* irgendeine Art von Aufsichts- oder Kontrollpflicht über Verhältnisse zwischen Erwachsenen und Kindern hatte.  Der Autor versucht es allen Ernstes trotzdem, indem er die Grünen als eine Art RKK der alternativen Szene hinstellt: dogmatisch, ideologisch homogen, streng hierarchisch organisiert, und mit Anspruch auf ewige, alleingültige Wahrheit und Unfehlbarkeit.  Dadurch versucht er offenkundig, diese Aufsichts- und Kontrollpflicht rückwirkend herzustellen, und sich dann über die eklatanten Verletzungen ebendieser als Höchster Richter aufzuspielen.  Gleichzeitig verzerrt er die Vergangenheit in absolut unredlicher Weise.  Die Kinderladenbewegung war garantiert nicht der »Markenkern« der studentischen Linken.  Ebensowenig war Pädophilie in der Ideologie angelegt, denn zu behaupten, es habe innerhalb einer Szene, die für Sektiererei und Fragmentation bekannt ist, jemals einen pädophilen Ideologiekern gegeben, ist vollkommener Schwachsinn.  Auch zu behaupten, aus Theorien Horkheimers und Adornos ließe sich eine Linie ziehen zu Hypothesen, dass »sexuelle Befreiung« von Kindern diesen die Herausbildung weniger aggressiver Persönlichkeiten ermögliche, ist unhaltbar.  Bei solchen Ansichten dürfte es sich wohl eher um verzerrende Instrumentalisierungen der Erkenntnisse aus der Neuropsychologie, wie sie von James W. Prescott gewonnen wurden, handeln.  Aber Säulenheilige der Studentenbewegung zu beschmieren, macht halt Spaß.

Das Problem des Artikels scheint viel mehr zu sein, dass sein Autor im Zuge seiner Beschäftigung mit dem Themenkomplex »Sexuelle Gewalt gegen Kinder« wie nicht wenige vor ihm die Distanz dazu verloren hat: Nicht die Grünen sind Gläubige, wie er schreibt, sondern er selbst ist es, und er wähnt sich in einem Heiligen Krieg gegen schändende Heerscharen, die den Kindern an ihre Unschuld wollen.  Deswegen ist seine Sprache auch so durchtränkt von religiösen Motiven und Ideologemen (sein Buch zum Skandal an der Odenwald-Schule heißt *Sündenfall*).  Dass er den Artikel mit einer unnötig plastischen Beschreibung eines sexuellen Übergriffs (»spritzte Sperma an die Windschutzscheibe«, »sein Glied in den Mund nehmen«) beginnt, lässt andererseits tief blicken: hier predigt einer und schreckt dabei auch vor der Reizung niederster Instinkte nicht zurück, nicht unähnlich dem Verhalten, das Abtreibungsgegner an den Tag legen, wenn sie in Fußgängerzonen ihre Ansichten in die Welt tragen.  Der eigentliche Zweck dieses Artikels ist aber der Satz: »Die Grünen befinden sich inmitten ihrer moralischen und programmatischen Kernschmelze.« Es geht dem Autor, diesem Weißen Ritter, um nichts als eine Demonstration seiner Deutungsmacht im Kampf gegen die Kinderschänder und ihren vermeintlichen oder tatsächlichen Unterstützer.  Womöglich bereitet er dadurch seinen Bruch mit der Linken als Ganzes vor, und vielleicht dürfen wir uns auf eine Kolumne in der *Welt* freuen, in der Herr Füller als Kronzeuge über das, was er für die Linke hält, vom Leder ziehen wird.  Leute wie er erkennen nicht, dass sie in ihrem verblendeten Zorn ein großer Teil des Problems der sexuellen Gewalt gegen Kinder sind.  Wenn man sich nämlich die Entwicklung der Erforschung sexueller Aspekte der Neuropsychologie seit den 1970er Jahren ansieht, wird man sehen, dass es auf diesem Gebiet fast keinen Fortschritt gegeben hat.  Dies hat damit zu tun, dass selbsternannte Moralwächter sich vehement auf alles stürzen, was irgendwie auch nur einer Apologie von sexueller Gewalt an Kindern ähnlich gemacht werden kann.  Eine Manifestation dieses Komplexes war [der »Skandal« um die Broschüre *Körper, Liebe, Doktorspiele*](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/koerper-liebe-doktorspiele-von-der-leyen-stoppt-umstrittene-aufklaerungsbroschuere-a-497527-druck.html).

We got a rental car because I got a good deal, and mostly parked it and explored each city. Then we used it to drive from city to city. 

We stayed in Vicenza, Trieste, Venice, Bologna, Florence, and Verona. Being able to move around easily was great. We didn't get down south to the Tuscany region, but we had an amazing time nonetheless. (Venice was our favorite btw.)

Also, I suggest trying to pick up a bit of Italian before you go, and take along the Fodor's Essential Italy guidebook. It was great for finding little out of the way places that aren't tourist traps, and was really clear about how expensive things were. (Prices of restaurants).

That's cold enough to turn diesel fuel into a thick syrupy slush... Needless to say, I didn't spend much time outside those days, except for walking to/from school.

When the temperature later rose to -20°C a couple of days later, you were basically sweating under all your clothes.

---

Yeah, I moved to southern Sweden and it's very different down here. I now live 1000km/600mi south of the arctic circle, instead of 100km/60mi *above* it.   

Here summer temperatures oscillates around 20-25°C, with a few rare days above 30°C every year. During the *much shorter* winter temperatures usually hover between +5°C and -5°C, only occasionally down to -15°C during short cold snaps.

Coastal climate gives us very little snow compared to just 30-40km inland, but on the other hand very high humidity which makes the cold able to penetrate your clothes more effectively.

It's actually much easier to dress for the extremely cold dry winters up north than for rainy and stormy 0°C winter days down here, but it's an easy trade for me since the winters are much shorter here and we get more evenly spread sunlight over the year.

I do miss the summers up north, when the sun never sets. Temperatures then are almost the same as down here, just for a couple of months shorter time... It's not really the winter cold that gets you up there; it's the length of the winters and, more significantly, the darkness of the polar night.

Ho capito solo ora. Significa che se ti rivolgi a un giudice per un caso di violenza domestica non paghi le spese processuali, e non le paghi neanche se l'accusa è falsa (qui è il riferimento alla presunzione di innocenza [riferimento molto leggero, c'è da dirlo]). In poche parole, se una donna si inventa una violenza domestica da parte del coniuge/compagno, non paga le spese processuali che finiscono a carico dei contribuenti direttamente, e il gratuito patrocinio (così si chiama questa norma) parte sin dall'inizio del processo, ovvero è a carico dei contribuenti sin dal primo giorno.

It is mainly due to the fact that medical diplomas are very expensive in US and most doctors start their career heavily indebted. 

So, the fact that the French education system is heavily subsidized and that you can go through medicine school without contracting a loan (or really a minimal one to pay for lodging) is also to be taken into account.

Nothing is free, but it is shocking to see how some organization can tolerate a huge amount of waste/corruption. Sometimes you are paying two or three times a normal price for no valid reason.

J'ai dit ""tout le monde est ingrat, car il est nécessaire de l'être"". L'OP l'a mal pris, tu l'as mal pris. Pourtant il n'y avait aucune insulte. Juste un constat froid et simple : Il est plus simple d'être ingrat que de vivre dans une conception moyen-âgeuse de la redevabilité éternelle. Envers ses parents, envers ses enseignants, envers son pays. On passe à autre chose. Mais je trouve que c'est un vrai gâchis quand des gens comme l'OP n'arrivent même pas à faire la part des choses et à reconnaître à chacun son dû. La France n'est certainement pas le meilleur pays du monde mais elle vient de quelque part, elle est arrivée jusqu'ici et c'est son modèle, ses valeurs qui ont contribué plus que tout le reste à la personne qu'est l'OP ou que tu es aujourd'hui. Il n'est pas question d'argent, il n'est pas question de lier son destin par un contrat inaltérable ou de couler avec le navire. Il s'agit uniquement d'être juste. 

Et puis, c'est marrant cet hymne à l'attachement régional. Attachement régional qui ne correspond à rien en France depuis plus d'un siècle ( homogénéisation par l'école et les infrastructures de communication ). Tu vas dans n'importe quelle ville de France, il n'y a aucune spécificité en dehors de l'équipe de foot locale. Mêmes hypermarchés/mêmes routes/mêmes divertissements/mêmes boulots. 

La seule chose que cela prouve, c'est l'habileté des politiciens ( ceux que tu décries tant, les mêmes, au cheveu près ) à jouer les gens les uns contre les autres. La famille avant la ville, la ville avant le départemenet, le département avant la région, la région avant le pays, le pays avant l'Europe. Alors qu'ils remplissent tous des rôles différents et qu'ils ont souvent de bonnes raisons d'exister. Sachant que les régions en France n'existent pour ainsi dire que depuis les années 70, on constate véritablement la facilité à faire croire à l'existence d'attachements fictifs. 

Ce qui me semble hallucinant dans l'histoire, c'est la prétention et l'ignorance crasse des censeurs de ton genre qui sous couvert d'une justice qu'ils sont les seuls à brandir se permettent tout amalgame et tout raccourci pour faire l'économie de tout argument.

Si on en revient au cœur de ton propos, la seule forme de reconnaissance que j'ai envers mon pays est d'un point de vue historique. On ne peut pas nier que jusqu'à De Gaulle (approximativement), la France était une grande nation et que j'en ai bénéficié. Depuis cette époque par contre, je ne vois pas en quoi je devrais être reconnaissant envers quiconque sinon mes parents. Des profs qui ont choisi leur métier par conviction, j'en ai pas rencontré des masses. De tes exemples, j'ai un gros respect pour les pompiers mais de là à parler d'ingratitude il y a un fossé énorme.

L'attachement régional est par définition régional... Tirer une conclusion unifiée me parait grotesque. J'ai passé 20 ans à Paris et je n'en tire pas un attachement inconsidéré car il n'y a pas de liens entre parisiens.

Ich kann mich an die Debatte damals (allerdings auch nur aus Fernsehen und Zeitung) noch recht plastisch erinnern. SchwuPs versuchten damals mit körperlicher Präsenz die Tagesordnung des Kongresses der NRW-Grünen kurzfristig zu ändern. Dass es welche gab, die versuchten, mit ihren Trieben in einer Partei Fuß zu fassen, ist unbenommen, aber man hatte damals den Eindruck, dass sich die Partei sich diesen Strömungen einigermaßen erwehren konnte, einer Kultur zum Trotz, alles durchzudiskutieren und nichts abzuwürgen. Diese Vorfälle haben die Grünen schließlich den Einzug in den NRW-Landtag gekostet, wie Otto Schily im Nachhinein bedauernd feststellte. Der Unterschied zur katholischen Kirche ist, dass die Pädophilen unter ihnen nicht in einer öffentlichen Debatte einen Freibrief für das Ausleben ihrer Triebe versuchen zu erhalten.

Le post de l'OP, c'était une façon de chier sur la France, sur les parisiens, avec un clin d'oeil entendu comme quoi il était normal de mépriser notre pays ( comme quoi, même en parcourant des milliers de km, un Français reste un Français ). Laquelle des deux attitudes est véritablement la plus méprisante et la plus insultante ? Je pense que l'exercice est à l'initiative du lecteur. 

De Gaulle, de Gaulle, de Gaulle?  A part un style excessivement ronflant, que peut-on lui attribuer ? Ce n'est pas plus lui seul qui a conçu sa politique, qu'il ne l'a mise en oeuvre. Des hommes et des femmes brillants ont oeuvré tout autant à leur niveau pour qu'elle prenne corps. Tout n'en revient pas toujours à ""une certaine idée"" de la France. D'ailleurs, je n'ai pas envie de faire l'éloge de la France. Ce n'était pas mon but. 

Je voulais plutôt parler des raisons qui conduisent à un déni de réalité total, qui conduisent à glorifier cette fiction qu'est la région française ( vraiment créée de toute pièce dans les années 70 avec des arguments essentiellement économiques et très peu identitaires quand on s'est aperçu que le département était trop petit pour faire des autoroutes ). Quand on doit beaucoup, il est difficile de l'admettre. Quand les attaches et la contrainte sont faibles, elles donnent tout de suite le reflet positif des choses librement consenties, mais à tort. Car quoi de plus aliénant que de faire sien une identité ressortie des greniers pour des besoins électoraux et touristiques. Faire semblant de porter des costumes d'époques ou de manger des choses locales alors que 99% des repas que l'on consomme et des habits que l'on met sont produits en Chine ou à l'autre bout de la France. Mention spéciale aux successeurs de ""Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis"", on entretient un mythe pour vendre de la salade. 

&gt;Tu te rends compte que tu es en train de te décrire là ?

Non. J'appelle pas aux downvotes de gens qui ne sont pas d'accord avec ma pomme.

Non, c'est l'OP qui a commencé à déverser son dédain de la France, dans le subreddit éponyme.

Il s'est barré tant mieux pour lui, qu'il vienne pas en plus juger à l'oeil dans une communauté de supposés semblables pour étaler son égoïsme et son ingratitude qui, assumée comme il le fait et non comme une nécessité en devient désormais une tare.

It's too early though for examples. I'll wake up in a couple of hours and I'll have something for your.

Then, there's the [litotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litotes) which is the main characteristic of the French language for me. In almost any 5 minutes of discussion with a French speaker, you'll notice the frequency of ""It's not bad"", ""It's not idiothic"", ""It's far from being completely wrong"", and many other far more complex, but as I said, it's early... This gives you the impression that the French speakers are imaginative and that the language allows you to play with it... flexible.

Another thing: being a phonetical language, you get more words that rhime which might contribute to this flexibility impression.

On the other hand, the French language has a lot of rules which for me voids the whole flexible thing. It's a contradiction in terms, like a ""cool military school""... or something.

True, but sometimes you just have to went your anger on sheer stupidity that people keep repeating.

&gt; US Republicans? So continuing with the massive spending but instead of welfare, spending it on the military? Eww, how absolutely disgusting.

What unites Republicans is essentially fiscal conservatism and belief on small government. Of course as people are just people, they can easily become corrupted, thus massive spending on big government in areas of internal and external security.

I don't know what European version of the Republican party would do, maybe instead of defense spending it would try to advance unneeded infrastructure and R&amp;D funding. But what is sure that there is no way that European taxpayers would be willing to create a European welfare state. The reason is simple, taxpayers that fund the welfare need to truest that the money is well spend and the spending is for the betterment of the whole society. The problem is that there is hardly enough truest left in the North to continue with out current framework, in the south there is no truest at all, otherwise Greek doctors would be happily paying their taxes. If just move funding and decision making up to Brussels, what you will end up is people allying behind the least common denominator, and in this case that is unease and doubt against other people.

&gt; The economy isn't zero-sum, under free trade everybody would benefit. Not that the EU is interested in the well-being of its citizens as much as it is in its lobbies, so we'll have to fix that first.

I'm not against free trade, and yes, you are right that free trade CAN benefit everybody, however currently free trade isn't benefiting everybody because many states especially in central and south Europe have strangled the functioning and flexibility of the private sector so tight that it can't renew and grow itself.

The reason why I'm very afraid of this is because time is of the essence. Southern Europe has suffered very badly due to opening of tariffs, Chinese and Indian manufacturers have taken over many markets that were before served by southern European companies. Many of these companies are still there, but if they don't start to succeed and grow again, the know-how and knowledge that were tied down to them and to industrial clusters that they formed will be lost forever. That is why is so crucial that we get rid of south vs. north division because it is not German companies eating Italian or Spanish companies, it is the competition that is coming outside the union.

If they move further to the right, they lose yet more of their traditional voters on the left. If they stay where they are, their policies are almost indistinguishable from the CDU, and their lack of competent personalities doesn't exactly help.

The outcome can only be CDU/CSU + X, where X might be the FDP, their partner in the unpopular current coalition which has been in self-destruct mode for years now, the SPD in an always difficult ""grand coalition"", or the Greens in a probably not very stable novelty coalition that neither of the two bases wants.

Sorry to say I don't know any here who have permanently moved, I've only met some Americans who are here on a short-term basis. Although, even judging by Reddit, Americans in Sweden do exist!

&gt; I'm always surprised how the people of Spain or Greece where unemployment is past 25% don't all move? Are there laws preventing them from doing this? Why stay in a country where you can't find work?

And what are they going to do in those other countries? The most immediate hurdle is language. You need to know a country's language to get a job there. There are exceptions of course for some highly qualified (university professor) jobs, and for low-pay manual jobs (berry pickers), but the highly qualified people can get jobs even in Spain and Greece, while cheap manual labour has its own problems. The average unemployed Spaniard, despite facing nearly 25% unemployment in Spain, still has a better chance of getting a job there than in Sweden, Germany or whatever. Language is an issue like I said, most employers will prefer hiring locals, finding a job normally requires being in the country already (which comes with its own financial and logistical problems), and so on. This is not to say that people from those countries do not move. They do, but it's not an option for everyone or even the majority.

I remember hearing a horror story about some Spanish guys who tried to move to Norway a year or two ago. They apparently thought that hey, Norway has jobs for everyone, so they should just move. They spent money coming to Norway with little prior research and were quite shocked to discover that thay need to know Norwegian to even look for a job, and that their rudimentary broken English really stands out in a country where every teenager is fluent.

&gt; If you don't mind me asking, are Swedish women really THAT pretty? Because I imagine Latvian women as pretty killer too. Pretty much anywhere in the Baltics or Scandinavia.

I have no complaints whatsoever ;)

&gt; residual soviet-era sentiment

This is something hard to explain while at the same time I could write a whole essay about my personal observations. I was only a child in Soviet times so never actually experienced life in an authoritarian state, but some patterns that I've seen in Latvia I've also seen in other ex-Soviet states. These are patterns caused by past authoritarianism. The number one thing is that people are not trusting. They distrust any government but they also distrust other people. There's an implicit assumption that others are likely to screw you over if you give them a decent chance to do so. Another related thing is that honour-based systems do not work. Rules will only work as long as there's decent enforcement. Take public transport. In Latvia, it is not uncommon for people not to pay their fare - and ticket control is fairly common, as it has to be, otherwise there'd be even fewer payers. Or take recycling. Highly uncommon in Latvia as most places will have just one all-purpose trash container. I remember some attempts to introduce recycling and they failed. My personal theory is that it fails largely because it would not be checked or enforced, it would just be something people are expected to do to make life better in the community, but they won't.

So there's sort of a ""every man for himself"" feeling. Interestingly, I'd also use that phrase to describe USA, but it's of a completely different nature. In the States, it applies to the rather cutthroat nature of business and to the social system, but it comes from the belief that people should achieve things through their own work and effort. In ex-Soviet states it's a relic of a completely different thinking, that anyone can be an enemy, and that there isn't really so much to go around and you'd rather worry about yourself. Fortunately everything that I say is rapidly getting better thanks to the young generation of people who grew up in a post-Soviet environment and got considerable exposure to life in the more developed European countries.",0,1376906620,null,0,false,0,cbqs88d,t3_1klsfs,t1_cbqs88d,t1_cbqjuzw,null,1429777821,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Taxes are just every citizen's contribution to the state. The only reason we do it in the form of tax is that it's more practical than asking everyone to make their contribution in the form of labor or goods. Having a high or low tax rate is not important: spending it effectively is indeed what matters. If a government were to provide adequate goods and services for it, there is no fundamental reason why a country couldn't run on 90% taxation if the citizens accepted it.

&gt;Hah! What a joke! Instead of cutting public expenditures, we should just print more money, wow, what a genius plan, I wonder why nobody ever tried that before!

It's called investment. Sick people don't work. People that are concerned with reaching the end of the mont without getting hungry aren't going to invest in a business. People that can't afford education aren't going to make products with a high profit margin... And if these investments prove to be misdirected, you just get inflation, making everything cheaper. Very little can go wrong.

&gt;Our banks don't need to be recapitalised. It's our state the one that can't keep its expenditures in accordance to its revenue.

It's a banking crisis. It only became a sovereign debt crisis as soon as the states of Europe collectively decided that they'd rather take out debt than risk setting of the dominoes in the financial system. And it will remain a sovereign debt crisis as long as the ECB refuses to play its role of lender of last resort to get out of crisis situations.

And the bank bailouts weren't even enough: they're still to afraid to lend to each other. Any money you pump in the system will be absorbed by banks to repair their balance sheets, so there really isn't even danger of hyperinflation. Even if it should happen, that will just erase the excessive debt... The only thing that matters in economy is being productive, and in these times that means investing in productive capital.

Ich bin seit August Diplom Übersetzer. Unser Jahrgang hat 164 Absolventinnen hervorgebracht. Inklusive mir haben 5 einen Job. 
Allerdings nicht weil es keine Stellen gebe, sondern weil die anderen es einfach verplant haben, zwischen den Prüfungen auch mal Stellenanzeigen zu lesen und sich zu bewerben. 

Am Tag der Urkundenvergabe hatte ein Großteil keine Ahnung was sie jetzt tun sollen. Die meisten suchen irgendeinen Weg um weiter zu studieren, mussten aber feststellen, dass man für die meisten Masterstudiengänge einen Notendurchschnitt von über 2,5 haben muss und das haben vielleicht 30% des Jahrgangs. Und selbst, wenn sie weiter studieren ist das meistens auch nur 2-3 Jahre mehr Zeit um sich der Realität zu stellen. 

Erschreckend war auch, wie viele überhaupt nicht als Übersetzer oder Dolmetscher arbeiten wollen. Die Fachakademie an der ich studiert habe war nur staatlich annerkannt, d.h. die Studiengebühren waren mit 195€ pro Monat relativ hoch. Wenn ich dann von Kommilitonen gehört habe ""eigentlich will ich ja gar nicht übersetzen"", dachte ich mir immmer ""Warum zum Geier bist du dann hier und wirfst dem Institut 2000€ pro Jahr in den Rachen?"". Warum sitze ich in einem Studium das in einem Beruf endet, den ich nicht machen will? Einige habe ich auch gefragt und die meisten haben dann geantwortet ""Weil ich was mit sprachen zu tun haben wollte und mein Papa zahlt ja.""

But if it means you can always find a pre-existent word or expression in your target language to say what you need to say, then yes, it is flexible. But then every language is flexible. There is always a way to say anything. It wouldn't be an efficient language otherwise, would it? 


So 'flexible' is maybe not the best way to describe the French language.
Because to me, flexible means that thanks to its grammar rules, a target language can adapt itself very easily to a more contemporary way of talking. Which is not really the case in French (especially with all those strict grammar rules and spellings - we are real grammar nazis).

French needs context. It needs context so it can be precise. Every time a student asks me if he or she can say this or that (I'm a language assistant in New Zealand), first thing that comes to my mind is *it depends*. Because even if it basically means the same thing, an expression could be entirely different from one context to another. 

And it reveals another paradox in the French language. We need precision, but people trying to 'save' the French language (naming no name) tend to forget that if a word is already ~~wildly~~  widely used it doesn't need to be translated. As a native French speaker, it always sounds a bit weird and old fashion when a new word is translated into French, especially from English. I am sure most French people will agree with me when I say that *podcast* sounds much better than *baladodiffusion* or *email* than *courriel*. We just say it with [a horrible French accent](http://youtu.be/50dKuVqFtqU?t=9s) and I'm totally okay with it.

Опасность реимпорта

По словам Глазьева, украинский бизнес до сих пор был оторван от воздействия на принятие решений и только сейчас знакомится с соответствующим проектом соглашения.

Советник президента сообщил, что в соглашении прописан пункт о том, что Украина обязуется пропускать европейские товары практически без досмотра, то есть уплаты пошлины, без ветеринарно-санитарных проверок.

""На украинском рынке появится огромное количество европейских, турецких и прочих товаров, которые потом будут перетекать к нам. Поэтому мы в первую очередь опасаемся реимпорта"", — сказал советник президента, добавив, что уже сейчас зафиксировано большое количество неукраинского мяса, сыров и других товаров, проходящих через границу.

Если этот поток, отметил Глазьев, станет системообразующим фактором в торговых отношениях с Украиной, то таможне придется работать так же, как и европейцам, — ""жестко проверять правила происхождения товаров"".

""Российская таможня до сих пор не ставила Украине высокий уровень риска, просто не желая нарушать тех операционных связей, которые еще поддерживаются в нашем экономическом сотрудничестве. Но если Украина подписывает соглашение об ассоциации с ЕС и берет на себя обязательства слепо выполнять все нормы европейского регулирования и без контроля пропускать европейские товары, это приведет к очередному реимпорту плюс к вытеснению украинских товаров, которые не будут выдерживать конкуренции"", — сообщил советник президента.
Контроль необходим

По оценкам, импорт из стран Евросоюза вырастет на 4 миллиарда долларов, уточнил Глазьев.

""Это убьет окончательно украинский торговый баланс и приведет к дефолту Украины по своим внешнеэкономическим финансовым обязательствам"", — считает советник главы государства.

Он добавил, что перед этими проблемами Украина бросит все свои возможности на российский рынок, и в этом случае также необходимо все администрировать.

Сообщения о масштабах проблем на российско-украинской границе противоречивы. Представитель РЖД сообщил ""Прайму"" в четверг, что на подходах к границе скопилось около тысячи вагонов. В то же время и украинские пограничники, и российские таможенники сообщают, что столпотворения на границе нет. Пункт пропуска Брянской области работает в штатном режиме, очереди наблюдаются в Троебортном, но, по словам таможенников, это рабочая ситуация. Проблем на таможенном посту Фокинский, который занимается оформлением железнодорожных грузов, тоже нет. Штатная ситуация и на таможенных постах Белгородской области.

No, i fully agree. If the fact that Crimea never before was a part of Ukraine and it's not populated by ukrainians doesn't convince you in anything, then you kind of lose all moral arguments in having it, if Russia decides to take it let's say. No hard feelings, ""the future will decide"", sure.

The problem was that the SU had little high quality stuff to export, yet they wanted more and more high quality industrial products from Finland.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Around the late 8th Century the Danish vikings had really geared up their conquest of the UK. Ælfrǣd (Alfred) the Great (two letters in that name that no longer are used in English) was the first warlord to style himself as King of the Anglo-saxons and King of England. It's worth noting at this point - the ENTIRE of the UK was Danish. Only one Anglo-saxon Kingdom remained. The Kingdom of Wessex.

At the time England was not thought of as one solid country (Alfred was king of Wessex with friends in Lundene/London) and Ælfrǣd was the first person to envision a united country up to Northumberland to repel successfully the Danish invasion. 

At the time you had to understand every county was it's own Kingdom. Take for example the [Kingdom of Mercia.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/England_Great_Army_map.svg) which was in effect it's own kingdom  - similar to East Anglia and Northumberland at the time. 

The UK has an incredibly rich history but Alfreds repelling of the Danish horde has rippled throughout all time. For instance imagine an England incapable of uniting against the Danish vikings who were pagans at the time and burned every monastery they could. With the saxons defeated Christianity as a religion may have been wiped out and the Danish may have furthered their empire. A divided England 8th century onward in Europe may have been nothing more than a place to pillage and burn for the Dutch/French/Spanish/Portugeese empires to come. 

The survival of the West Saxons in Wessex at the behest of Ælfrǣd the Great shaped the UK for millenia to come and is truly a fascinating part of UK history.

If Alfred had not prevailed would the UK have returned to paganism? Would the Anglo-saxon countries (America, Canada, Aus, NZ) have Christian roots or pagan roots? Would we be reading reddit in some bastardised form of Danish? Would they exist at all? Would the UK have remained a deeply divided Island with many different Kingdoms?

A very exciting part of history. I recommend reading the BBC article on him rather than go by my ramblings though :)

* You need to pay a licencing fee to buy a television so the BBC has money. 
* Holy binge drinking Batman. 
* Every vegetable that isn't part of a salad or a roast is boiled. 
* There's a huge cultural divide between north and south. Mostly it's class, but I just heard a working-class Devonian bitch about people from Birmingham the other day, so I think it's more than that. 
* Class is based on education rather than income. 
* Pretty much everyone who isn't old money hates Thatcher (in my experience). 
* There is a ""benefit class"" of people who live on benefits and don't work. Much of this is due to the fact that many industrial jobs went overseas during the 80s. Mining was a major employer of many working class communities, until nationalized mining companies were pretty much shut down at the same time. So now all these people can either work at Tescos, join the educated workforce, or get benefits. Many chose the third option, pissing off the rest of the country. 
* David Cameron, the current PM, is banking on resentment towards the benefit class by creating policies that make things harder on them, like taxing them if they have too many bedrooms in their council houses. 
* Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have a some sort of semi-autonomous status within the UK, allowing them to make many of their own governing decisions. 
* The sun literally never sets on the British empire, because they still have bits of islands around the world and the sun will always be up on at least one of them. 
* In my experience (huge generalization based on British inlaws, hanging out in British expat communities) British people still treat the EU with a fair bit of suspicion and tend to not see themselves as European culturally.
* Apparently Cadbury chocolate is classed as cheese by the EU because the milk content is too high. Some English people seem to take this as a cultural insult, spinning the prayer wheels of resentment toward the EU. 
* There is a WWII memorial in every town, no matter how small. 
* The NHS is getting a bit weird, but people seem still proud of it as an institution. 
* Until Tony Blair changed the Labour party charter, the Labour party was a communist party that aspired to the abolition of private property. So when the UK had a labor government in the few decades following WWII, it was effectively a democratic socialist country. 
* My inlaws (and husband) all went to boarding schools. It's a bit like Harry Potter, except less magic, and more violence, drugs/alcohol, sex, and being told you're ""the best ofthe best ofthe best"". I've been told they only banned corporal punishment in boarding schools in the 90s.
* Some people in south east England get their water from a French utility company (via the chunnel) cause it's cheaper.

Thanks to the system it can be hard to get out of the benefits trap, for example if you have been out of work for more than a year you should get £100 and you rent and council tax paid for four weeks if you get back into work. 
Sound like a good idea right? But that may mean that you have to survive until your first payday, many companies work a month in arrears so if you started a job today you may not be paid until the end of September and it will be unlikely that your £100 will cover all your costs for up to eight weeks (that will include four weeks of rent and council tax).  If you have been out of work for a while you are not going to have any savings and the only people that will lend you money will do so at 4000% interest. 
And that is if you qualify for this, zero hour contracts are extremely common for people getting into work and unless you have 20+ contracted hours you are not going to even get £100 plus four weeks rent/tax paid. 

So you can be offered what is in fact a full time role at a living wage but just be unable to get to your first payday.

Most people that receive benefits within the UK are retired (the largest identifiable group)  or in employment but still require benefits to live. 

This is a typically English apprach to an issue, blame people rather than question the system.

What I totally agree with: the economic factor is always the first one in english strategy. For the french, it was all about the prestige. And also, if it fucks up with the brits, we go for it. I.e., the US independance war.

So, why the french didn't take the lead in colonizing america, when we were 4 times more populated than england for most of the period? Because many reasons: France has had to live next to powerful land neighbours such as the habsbourgs, the bourbons in Spain, etc... And was in a constant state of war to defend/extend his lands. The kings Louis XIV to XVI always hadto maintain a huge infantry ni order to do so. The agriculture also needed many arms to feed the country. Also I read that Louis XIV mistakenly believed that France was depopulating, because the imperfections of the statistic tools he had at the time. So, France demography was underestimated and he didn't want to send many citizens to america. Cause who cares about America? The prestige was what mattered to him.

Je travaille dans l'IT, et je réalise tous les jours à quel point mes connaissances sont limitées quand je parle avec les experts réseau, devs, data, infra...

C'est toujours relatif à l'état du savoir d'un individu, c'est vrai que l'informatique se ramifie en plusieurs sous-domaines (ou disciplines) et je pense que l'un des plus grand mal fait à la discipline au sens large... ben c'est que les gens considèrent que c'est une discipline au sens large en fait.
Les gens balancent pelle-melle toutes les personnes ""sachants se servir d'un ordinateur mieux que les autres"" dans un même sac, alors que c'est à des degrés trop différents pour être un critère sérieux.

Parmi les symptômes, on a le terme de ""geek"" qu'on croise à tout va (m’irritant au plus au point) pour désigner le premier connard venu passant son temps à télécharger des applications smartphone à tout va et le labelliser en plus de ça de connaisseur.

Mais pour en revenir à nos moutons, oui un if{}else{} c'est trivial aussi pour moi à ce niveau là, mais j'ai côtoyé des gens à fortiori viables dans la caboche qui étaient dépassés par des structures algorithmiques ""simples"" (plus complexe qu'un if{}else{} je te l'accorde) pourtant ils ont essayé, pour autant ça ne les empêchait pas d'être plus efficace que moi dans d'autres domaines.

De ton coté tu peux considérer que ce dont on parle est trivial, encore une fois oui selon le contexte ça l'est entièrement, mais même si tu considères que y a plus complexe et subtile que ça (ce qui est vrai en fait) ça n'implique pas que ce que tu penses ne pas être impressionnant ou pas complexe se fasse en un claquement de doigt pour les autres.

&gt; Ça par contre, c'est vrai. Je considère qu'une personne ne sachant pas insérer un disque de Win et suivre les consignes est intellectuellement fainéante.

Et je pense que tu as raison, mais ce n'est pas ce cas là qui me pose problème (ce n'est d'ailleurs pas celui que je cite), je parle juste du fait de demander aux gens de savoir coder.

Scotland didn't resemble anything of the sort of a unified country at the time (same as England). 

But if there was a semblance of a vague idea of Scotland it was defeated by the Danes in 839.

&gt;In 839, a large Norse fleet invaded via the River Tay and River Earn, both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the Pictish kingdom of Fortriu. They defeated Eogán mac Óengusa, king of the Picts, his brother Bran and the king of the Scots of Dál Riata, Áed mac Boanta, along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The sophisticated kingdom that had been built fell apart, as did the Pictish leadership, which had been stable for more than a hundred years since the time of Óengus mac Fergusa (The accession of Cináed mac Ailpín as king of both Picts and Scots can be attributed to the aftermath of this event).

1. Saying ""that's pretty dope"" is slang for saying something is good or cool. Y'all is a southern expression meaning ""voi"", because the English language normally lacks such a construct. It's a contraction of ""you all"".

2. Shenanigans is mischief or deceit.

3. Strikeout or strike out means to fail at something. ""I struck out with that girl"" means I didn't get her phone number (now known as digits, like ""I didn't get her digits."").

4. Slide into home is more rare, but means scoring or accomplishing something, but just barely.

5. Pepper is a game played between two bases that are about 90 feet apart, with three players. A player stands on each base with a glove, and a runner runs between the bases. The baseball is tossed between the players on base, trying to tag the runner with it. They close in until they get him, or until he is safely on one of the bases. If they drop the ball, the runner can usually win. This situation sometimes comes up during actual baseball games, when the runner has the option to advance or stay where he is. In American English usage, it means being caught between two equally bad options. It is rare, but sometimes used this way.

6. Tag up happens when a ball is hit in the air, and caught while still in the air. After that happens, the runner is allowed to tag the base and then run to the next one. The usage in English means taking care of an obligation before going on to do something else. Again pretty rare.

7. Home run is a common American English term used in every day speech. A home run is a score in baseball, specifically when the ball is hit ""out of the park (another common English phrase)"" so that no defender can catch it. It is literally hit over the wall of the baseball field, and if ""fair (between the lines)"", the runner is allowed to go around all four bases to score, as is anyone else who is on any of the bases. If the three bases besides home plate are all occupied, it's called a ""grand slam"", scoring four points. Grand slam is another common American English phrase, meaning an outstanding accomplishment (they are rare in baseball).

8. A double play is when the fielders (people with gloves, defenders) are able to put two people out in one play. Three outs ends the ""inning"" for that team, and the other team is ""up to bat"". There are nine such innings in a game. In normal English usage, a double play is something like a ""hat trick"" in calcio (which is three scores in one game, if that doesn't translate).

9. NO PEPPER means that players are not allowed to warm up with games of pepper on the field, probably due to the potential for injury or damage to the field.",0,1376924868,null,0,false,0,cbqvxu5,t3_1ki1so,t1_cbqvxu5,t1_cbqfuyu,null,1429776017,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

true,skalp69,ZBSVUE,U-E,"Agde is a very small town AFAIK... For most things you'll want to go to Beziers, Montpellier or Sete.

If you like windy beaches activities (kite surf, kite kart, and so on) Look for the (Port?) Leucatte beach ""La Franky"" (not sure for the spelling). This is where most France wind records have been done. Beware for the beach can be flooded; quite often outside summer. Should be some 50-60 km from Agde; public transportation might be minimalist.

To sail catamarans, I advise you go to Sete which has city-owned cata rentals which are much cheaper than anything around.

Visit the seaside all around you. These are really beautiful. You ll make loads of karma on /r/pics ;)

Montpellier is the night life town close to you.

Dunno much about the food stores there... If you're fond of random bio vegetables, look for AMAP in Agde. These are systems to buy directly from *real* peasants. You pay a monthly fee, you get full baskets of what he grows every week. You cannot choose what you get. It's quite cheap, it's almost always quality products and it's always a culinary challenge (""how does one cook THIS? What's the name of it?""); but you should appreciate that

Cell phone companies: 

You could try ""free.fr""; I dont like 'em: they have no shops:you only correspond to them through internet/phone. They are the cheapest though. 

I prefer Sosh, you can contact them IRL through ""Orange.fr"" shops. They have an unlimited cell phone (No internet. Maybe excludes international calls) for 10€/month. ",0,1376926823,null,0,1376927195,0,cbqwm0y,t3_1kf9fe,t1_cbqwm0y,t3_1kf9fe,null,1429775704,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

Lawyers wouldn't be paid nearly as much as they are if we had a civil law system. OTOH civil law tends to be prescriptive and obvious problems with the law are hard to deal with because the judge has less leeway to actually judge.

&gt;You don't need a licence if you don't use any of these devices to watch or record television programmes as they're being shown on TV - for example, if you use your TV only to watch DVDs or play video games, or you only watch ‘catch up’ services like BBC iPlayer or 4oD.

true,Inclol,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;As a percentage change, northern countries like Sweden have experienced much bigger salary growth. So, you're paid too much.

Thats simply a load of bollox, the real wage growth was 1.6% between 1990-2013 here in sweden (medlingsinstitutet). As for the 'North' i general the Wage growth have been more or less flat and even negative during the pre crisis years, this for Spain and Italy as well. A qucik look at Erostat/ECB numbers totally refute you arguement.

&gt;Then why is their economy stagnating?

That should be fairly obvious, you might have heard about the Euro crisis. Also, Denmark won't be pushed into austerity because it has the institutional make up to actually reform and its not a prisoner of Eurocrats.


I don't think you fully understand what you're on about tbh, you're just parroting the leffist crap that usually fly around in places such as Greece.

Countries such as Norway, Denmark and Sweden are seen as relative safe havens compared to the cluster fuck that is the southern Euro area, this goes for Britain as well, regardless of debt. You know why? Because the markets have confidence in our institutions, and in the case of Sweden our banks are over capitalized and aren't full of toxic assets. The markets trusts our institutional ability to handle our predicaments, as opposed to the institutions in the southern Euro area that'll just drag their feet and kick the can. I mean look at Italy, its government is bacially hostage to a single man ( Berlusconi) who can topple the gov. at will. Also, look at Spain and all the current corruption scandals, I mean god almighty its like a fucking banana republic. With this in mind you wonder why we in the North don't have to deal with austerity and absurd interest rates? Are you kidding me? Its obvious, the sotuh simply does not have functioning institutions and it is no use pretending otherwise.

Not to mention that the protesters themselves tend to block up traffic really badly at times. It's one thing to protest the government, another to obstruct the lives of people who are just trying to get on with their day in the process.

Well, the whole point of protesting is to block normal life as a way to apply pressure to the government to listen to their demands. If people feel their government is not up to par, what else could they do? 

&gt; In Bulgaria, many people vote for the ""lesser evil"" of candidates, then protest the government after they're elected. Of course, lots of the protesters don't know what they truly want from the government, they just want them out of power because they dislike them.

That's a sad reality. People feel that something is rotten but there is no conscious understanding of what exactly the problem is and how it can be alleviated. But if they didn't express their dissatisfaction at all, that conscious understanding would be even harder to attain. Now that the issue is in the spotlight, we at least stand a chance at understanding it. If it's swept under the carpet, then we all continue our lives none the wiser.

Le second problème est qu'on se retrouve vite avec une société à 2 vitesse (ceux qui font que travailler et payer, et ceux qui font qu'encaisser) et que cela habitue les enfants à trouver cela normal.

En clair, pour donner un exemple plus concret : 

- Si tu joue à world of warcraft; tu veux une épée plus puissante tu va faire une quête en jeu ou loot un mob. Tu ne paye que l'accès au jeu.

- Maintenant avec les mmo F2P qui se répendent, tu paye parfois l'accès au jeu, mais surtout tu dois payer à nouveau l'épée. Et l'accès à la zone. Et le costume. Et l'expé pour avoir le level, et ci et ca.

Puis par la suite si le prix du payement monte, que faire ? Rien. C'est le problème de la grenouille dans la casserolle chauffée lentement; qui n'en sort en théorie pas.

Cela n'est pas réservé aux jeu mais tends à se répendre : Microsoft à par exemple tenté de rendre Windows moins cher... mais le passer en location. Ils se sont fait jetter en europe, mais s'ils avaient réussi en gros tu deviens locataire de ton ordinateur. Et sauf à payer la facture récurrente mensuelle en plus, ton pc refusait de démarrer.

true,[deleted],null,null,"L'article est intéressant, par contre je trouve l'exemple avec le script et les clés WPA assez tiré par les cheveux (voir purement et simplement du sadisme gratuit de la part d'un professeur de merde qui prends un plaisir malin à regarder les gens galérer, sous prétexte de leur apprendre la vie. Un peu comme abandonner 3J un gosse sur une ile déserte avec absolument rien ""pour leur apprendre la vie"". Bon j'éxagère mais vous avez l'idée, une semaine sans pc pour bosser ou lire ses emails peut vite vous mêttre dans la merde totale dans la vie courante). Même en tant qu'ex sys admin avec ce que je pense être un peu d'expérience ca serait un peu faire un un coup de p...éripatéticienne, a mon avis et je crois que je parlerais plus beaucoup à la personne qui ferais un coup pareil.

Après, de manière plus simple, filer un pc sans OS et inviter les gens à se servir de google et faire preuve d'initiative et plus généralement se ""démerder"" plus que leur causer des soucis ne serais pas un mal. Laisseez leur leur outils habituels mais poussez les à en découvrir de nouveaux par eux même.

Le problème n'est as pas que les gens ne savent pas se servir de leur pc mais qu'ils n'ont ni motivation, ni bon sens. C'est cela qu'il faut tenter de leur donner, du bon sens, et apprendre à tenter de se demander *comment il feraient si la réponse était sous leur nez*"". Volontairement cacher une clé WPA n'as pas de sens. Si maintenant il y à un fichier ""clé wpa.txt"" avec juste la clé wpa au centre en gros et seul ; là c'est qu'ils font pas d'effort;

J'ai tenté de prendre cette attitude avec ma famille et mon entourage ces temps ci. Par exemple, si ma soeur m'appel en me disant que son pc ne marche plus; la conversation sera du genre :

""camarchepa"" ""il se passe quoi ?"" ""bha camarchap""
""mais encore ?"" ""ca marche pas""
""regarde l'écran; tu voit quoi ?"" ""j'ai un écran bleu""
""et donc ... ?"" ""il dit des trucs. genre que je dois redémarrer le pc.""
""et donc tu en conclus quoi ... ?"" ""que je dois redémarrer le pc."" (silence) ""ok je suis stupide je le fais"".

Ca m'est arrivé à peu de mots pret la semaine précédente. Si la personne à ensuite des questions mon réflexe est de l'inviter à la poser à google, systématiquement (elle à un fixe et un portable donc c'est pas un soucis). Toutes les informations nécessaires y seront forcément présentes, et si elle à un souci qu'elle ne peut pas savoir il est quasi obligatoire que la réponse soit quelque part sur le net.

Apprenez au gens à se servir de leur bon sens, pas d'un ordinateur. Ils iront beaucoup plus loin dans la vie, et surtout ils sauront chercher par eux même en cas de souci le jour ou vous serez pas là pour leur répondre. Forcer quelqu'un à se servir de perl ou python n'as aucun sens, vu que 99% des gens n'en auront jamais le moindre usage dans la vie. Mais leur passer le disque de Windows en cas de souci, et leur dire de lire l'écran ne demandera probablement aucun effort particulier de leur part; à part peut-être se poser la question de ""comment je ferais si c'était possible de le faire et qu'il y avait un moyen évident; genre avec les instructions à l'écran. Oh surprise, elles y sont; et je n'ai rien à apprendre pour le faire"".	

~~La seule attitude qui me donne vraiment envie d'étrangler les gens c'est les clients au boulot qui se réfugient dans un ""oh vous savez les machins et truc comme l'électronique *ces trucs de gens qui ont rien à faire de leur vie que de bosser pour remettre mon pc en état oh oh oh* j'y comprends rien [et ca sers à rien d'y apprendre]."" Ca ca m'énerve assez rapidement car ce sont des personnes non pas qui ne savent pas comment faire, mais *refusent activement de savoir ou coopérer* et sont généralement condescendante au possible avec vous. On parle pas de personnes qui sont débordés ou paniquent ici mais qui ne veulent absolument rien faire jamais.~~

true,rocket_robin_hood,CANA,the meanest country in existence.,"lol, not surprised; I just got back from vacation in europe and the behaviour of the germans was intolerable. In Germany I had a waitress at a restaurant telling me to go back to Canada; and I am polite as a person can get, I'm trying to speak German so give me a break please.

 In other places in central Europe I would see allot of brattish behaviour on the roads, for example at a restaurant on a roadside rest stop while I was eating my meal their was this huge commotion because germans would keep parking their cars in the parking spots that are for the truckers. Literally the truckers were honking their horns and yelling because they could not park in their spots, and some German would just beligerently curse and make rude gestures with their hands, rather than getting in their car and parking in the area that is for cars. This happened over and over again as I sat there eating my meal; I think I counted 3 or 4 German vehicles doing this, as one would leave another would come and park in the trucks spot and act like a brat when the truckers try and tell them to move their cars. 

I wont get into any more examples of brattish German behaviour, I could go on for a bit; let me just say as someone that was looking forward to seeing germany and meeting german people, I was left pretty fucking dissapointed. The rest of the Europeans in the other countries I visited were always polite and courtious, as people  should be.

No worries. I picked up on that, but my full-duplex anti-humor spectralgenerator is just turned to 11. It's unfortunately a level where funky quantum effects comes into play, and odd things begin happening. More specifically, humor disintegrates in a cloud of uncertainty and I lose track of even my own intents with counter-snarky replies... (i.e *I ""cannot into humor""*.)

As for your question, I don't know really. I just noticed that dried food (pasta, rice, beans, etc) and canned food is priced on an more relatable level. It's still *slightly* more expensive than even Sweden, but the difference is hardly noticeable. I guess that type of wares is bought more in bulk, resulting in more reasonable prices.

I've also read something about how they've recently opened up some storage facilities for potatoes and similar food items in climate controlled spaces down in old mines, to allow more optimal storage conditions.

IIRC, potatoes did cost something like €5-6/kg when I was there.

CDG *cars* (a word for bus in French, also I wouldn't be so sure about the cheapness) or I think there's another bus that leaves you in the city, but I wouldn't know. Either way, the works in RER B are over and you can get to Paris in no time by this train...

&gt; And can you recommend us some cheap places for lunch in the center, the 9th and the 13th arr.?

The chinese places around the 13e. Yes, yes, you can eat that at home but take in mind this is *the* chinese-eating place of the city- you'll find a range of incredibly delicious food there that is nothing like Chinese ""back home"" ^(unless it's actually that good, I don't know and you're the judge). For cold cuts, cheeses and pieces of baguette you say, just go to a bakery or a small supermarket, buy a baguette, some good cheese (ask if you're **really** not sure, but cheese here is normally good) and a *saucisson* and you have what you're looking for! (maybe, I don't know of the exact name, but that combination is still good)

edit: the RER **does** have works until the 30 aug., so you need to take a bus until another station, and into Paris by train.

There, FTFY.

Look at what Ron Paul actually achieved during all his years if you want some perspective on the GOP commitment to what they preach.

&gt;I don't know what European version of the Republican party would do, maybe instead of defense spending it would try to advance unneeded infrastructure and R&amp;D funding.

We already have that, here in Portugal we call them the Socialist Party.

&gt;The reason is simple, taxpayers that fund the welfare need to truest that the money is well spend and the spending is for the betterment of the whole society.

If that was the case, there would be no welfare state.

&gt;If just move funding and decision making up to Brussels, what you will end up is people allying behind the least common denominator, and in this case that is unease and doubt against other people.

That already exists, in Brussels and in other places such as Lisbon.

&gt;I'm not against free trade, and yes, you are right that free trade CAN benefit everybody, however currently free trade isn't benefiting everybody because many states especially in central and south Europe have strangled the functioning and flexibility of the private sector so tight that it can't renew and grow itself.

That's not a problem caused by the Chinese or the Indians or whomever, in fact, if it wasn't for them, we'd be even worse because our goods would be even harder to afford.

The problems are the restrictions imposed on the economy and the lack of free trade (a principle the EU has demonstrably abandoned).

&gt;That is why is so crucial that we get rid of south vs. north division because it is not German companies eating Italian or Spanish companies, it is the competition that is coming outside the union.

Everybody competes with everybody to try and offer the final consumer the best service for the lowest cost, the shop across the street can and should offer just as fierce competition as the company based in Glasgow or as the one whose HQ are in Bombay.

Above a certain latitude they don't salt the roads as it doesn't give any effects at those low temperatures anyway, but at certain times of ambivalent weather by early winter and early/late spring, they might use sand.

When *driving* up there you need studded tires, as the roads might get packed too heavily and sometimes resemble ice, especially approaching intersections where all breaking vehicles have polished the snowy surface over time... but there's no problem walking. Heck, some years I even used my mountainbike with regular tires all year round, no matter the temperature.

In the middle and the south, they do salt the roads. The winters are much shorter, and along the west coast there's very little snow... There's a higher risk of slippery surfaces though, since the little snow that we actually get down here often melts and then freezes as thin ice...

I wouldn't *dare* to bike during winter down here without studded tires. That road salt might be effective to remove snow and ice at some weather condition, but it also results in a more frequent melting/freezing cycle. Drivers are however discouraged to use studded tires on their cars down here, as they only have an advantage over non-studded M+S tires for a week or two per year, instead they just wear down the road surfaces.

But regarding walking, I use regular sneakers all year round. There's only a few days a year when you have to be careful. Especially at early spring, when the melting/freezing cycle can result in some thin ice overnight and they haven't yet managed to sand/salt the sidewalks. It's especially troublesome it there's undercooled rain on top of that, but you also learn to tell what parts of the sidewalks to avoid.

Donner comme objectif aux enseignants d'apprendre ces fondamentaux aux élèves (plus qq uns...) serait beaucoup plus utile que telle ou telle application. 

Il faut effectivement un minimum de volonté et de bon sens et je suis d'accord sur le fait que les exemples pris ne sont pas forcément les plus pertinents. Après apprendre le fonctionnement permet aussi d'atténuer les appréhensions genre ""je vais / j'ai tout cassé"".

Ça peut commencer par une réinstallation de windows et ça peut finir par une programmation de station météo avec un Raspberry.

The US has low interest rates as well. It's just a sign of the depressed economy, since people aren't investing in new ventures as much. I guess insofar as the depressed economy in Europe is called the ""euro crisis"" the article is accurate. But the term ""euro crisis"" generally refers to the quite specific sovereign debt issues. Europe could easily have a depression without the sovereign debt problems and interest rates would still be quite low. 

Similarly if there wasn't a depression, and interest rates were higher, then the government would be raising a bunch more money. 

There is a truth that maybe is being highlighted here: the cost of the direct transfers (done in the name of the 'euro crisis') to Germany are minor compared to the cost being inflicted by the depression itself. But the idea that a depression saves you money by lowering interest rates is completely bonkers.

true,Saigon71,UNSA,United States of America,"TOP FIVE REASONS I HATE LIVING IN THE STATES

1. Americans are so competitive.  We pretend to have friends but really we are too busy comparing ourselves to each other and too worried about being showed up to show up for one another.  We worry our ""friends"", co-workers, and neighbors have nicer cars, bigger houses, and make more money, or that they have more ""friends"", or that they are cooler or happier. How can you be someone's friend if you don't wish the best for them?

2. Have you ever tried having a conversation with an American? They will tell you about their ""5 year plan"", how high they scored on their SATs, how much money they earned last year, but they don't know how to listen and have a back and forth conversation because they can't relate to you when they are too busy competing with you.

3. Um, why is everyone in such a hurry? I watched a man completely lose his shit because he had to wait 10 minutes for a burrito.  He sat practically convulsing in his chair with impatience.  I was worried he might shoot up the place.

4. Which brings me to my next point: why are we so violent? There's like a shooting every week.

5. Our relationship to food in this country is appalling.  I own a restaurant and sometimes when I am in the dining room I am sickened watching people shove food into their faces (yep, 50% of us are overweight, 30% obese).

Honestly, I get to Europe twice a year for at least a week to watch people being calm, to eat good food, and watch civil interactions.  I realize Europe has serious problems but honestly the US is going to explode itself from food, firearms, and internalized rage that comes from having no emotional support system.

To give you a quick example....we had some germans colleagues come out to the USA. We took them out to dinner, and in the middle of the dinner, somebody asked them, so how do you like the food? One german guy said something like, The meat is good, but the potatoes are too hard. The other german agreed and added that he didn't like something else (can't remember.)

Obviously, even if he didn't like the food, specially in that setting (you don't really know the people), an american person would have always said, ""oh yea, the food is good.""  

Needless to say, once the colleagues left, the talk in the office was, how rude the germans were. But i said, really? But this is how Germans are.

Haha, it's not that extreme really... 80+% of the population lives in the southern half where the climate is more forgiving. Those extremes I've described is mostly relevant for the most extreme *arctic* northern tip of the country, i.e corresponding to about 300mi north of Fairbanks, Alaska. The climate down here is not *that much* more extreme than the U.K and northern continental Europe.   
edit: Perhaps somewhat similar to the coastal climate of north-eastern U.S, despite Scandinavia being located much further north.

*Sometimes* I want to curse those masochistic neolithic humans who wandered up here in pre-historic times, instead of staying in the more temperate zones, but what can you do... Over the significant number of millenniums since then, we've lost our permanent sunblock. ;)

&gt; Have you ever thought about moving?

Yes, I'm being tortured by the thought ever fall/winter, but so far I've never been close to realize those thoughts.

&gt; Is the weather worth all the other benefits of living in Sweden?

Pretty much, though many people *do* move permanently to e.g Thailand or Spain when they retire. Salaries and vacation times also allow many people to leave the country for the tropics during the darkest weeks of December.

&gt; I'm sure the arctic summers are wonderful though. Are the mosquitoes bad?

They're awesome! The winters are also [truly awesome](http://flickrhivemind.net/Tags/kiruna), *they're just to darn* ***long***.

The mosquitoes up north are infamous, and dreaded, but I have to say that in more recent years they've been declining. It's a cycle which depends on certain factors, e.g precipitation during the ""right"" (or wrong) times of the year, temperatures during early spring, etc... They're not a problem in the cities/towns, but if you go fishing/hiking/golfing a late summer evening (or even night, as the sun never sets), prepare to be eaten! Over the years you'll learn to appreciate the impregnated strong ""aroma"" of your fishing gear with years of accumulated pitch/tar-based mosquito repellents, jungle oil, etc... but you'll also get hardened over time and don't notice the high pitched noise emitting bloodsuckers as much (except for when trying to sleep in a tent or cabin close to a bog or wet and mushy river valley).

They're rare in the south. Again, where 80+% of the population resides.

true,Quazz,BELG,Belgium,"Eh, it's debunkable on a more basic level than that: Belgium can function just fine even for a decade or so without a federal government due to the many governments on lower levels who already wield the majority of governmental power anyway.

Most of the economic decisions come from that point anyway. Federal government can help a bit with savings and such though, such as looking into taxes, paychecks and so on. 

Sure, Belgium hasn't implemented many austerity rulings and the like, but that doesn't mean they've just sat on their hands. 

However, that article that claims that ""the Netherlands is doing better in areas"" is kind of inflating the truth. Unemployment is cited, but that's rather silly, because for over a decade now the Netherlands has done better in that department, so attempting to use that discrepancy now to try and say ""it doesn't matter!"" is kind of dishonest. Especially since unemployment grew quite a bit more the last few years in the Netherlands than it did in Belgium.

What is actually being cut is this: Greece didn't have enough nurses and drugs in their hospitals. Benefits for the millions of unemployed across Europe are getting slashed. Pensions frozen. Education budgets slashed. Teachers and professors let go. Tuition fees raised. Police officers and firefighters fired - which in turn leads to wildfires burning unchecked for a while for example because, oh well, Mallorca doesn't have the money for firefighters anymore. And on top of that everything that can be privatized get's privatized with no pause and consideration whatsoever.

Meanwhile all of these countries are unable to stop the flight of capital offshore, their rich are busy buying houses in Berlin, Paris and London instead of having their money taxed and invested in their home countries.

Everyone who thinks that slashing the social services that make a society a society is a good idea while unemployment and general malaise is at a record high unseen for half a century should seriously re-examine what he is saying.
