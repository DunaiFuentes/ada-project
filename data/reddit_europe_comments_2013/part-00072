&gt; According to a sweeping Pew Research Center poll of Eastern Europeans released yesterday, “the prevailing view in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary is that people were better off economically under communism. Only in the Czech Republic and Poland do pluralities believe that most people are now better off”.


http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/hungary-better-off-under-communism/

&gt; A remarkable 72% of Hungarians say that most people in their country are actually worse off today economically than they were under communism. Only 8% say most people in Hungary are better off, and 16% say things are about the same.

Uh, yeah.  The point was, it does not require a planned economy for the government to take ownership and redistribute profits, because it can hold non-voting shares.  (There are also other mechanisms, that was just an example to illustrate.)

Outward we have to act in unity, internally we certainly should be able to disagree. Strong national rights are important in a frame of checks and balances to avoid a totalitarian EUdSSR. I think we should design the ideal EU around this concept of checks and balances with the nations on one side and the whole of the people on the other side. We have a similar system in Germany, it works quite well, though not ideally.

One possibility is to have the EU as a facilitator of national cooperation. Similar countries should cooperate and are encouraged to do so. Common military, common currency, common aspects of law. We have for example the nordic union, they some work in that direction. These smaller unions can then be expanded or kept, depending on how well they fare.

This is a complicated subject. The one thing I am not willing to accept though is an organization not democratically legitimized.

Eventually, the EU splits up leaving fully separate nations and a single one nation claims the rights to the moon is also theirs. They also attempt to cross over and remove the Chinese flag from the other side. In response the Chinese send a more permanent expedition back.

Ich sagte nicht, dass wir es bleiben lassen sollten. Ganz im Gegenteil. 

Klar müsste eine kritische Masse erreicht werden. Was meiner Meinung nach immer eine Frage der Zeit ist. Dem Reset müsste auch eine grundlegende ""Erleuchtung"" einhergehen. Es geht hier nicht um noch eine Revolution die dann aus dem Affekt herraus zu einem der Systeme greift die sonst so nach Revolutionen kommen wie, Diktaturen, Sozialismus, Faschismus, o.ä. Ich stelle mir eher eine vom Volk gewählte, zeitlich begrenzte Technokratie die die Strukturen für eine Demokratie des 21. Jahrhunderts entwirft und etabliert.

Eine Revolution zur Anarchie von diesem System aus würde tatsächlich sehr sehr blutig werden. Für solche Systeme gilt wie für den Kommunismus: er funktioniert nur wenn alle mitmachen und das ist im Anarchismus per Definition nicht möglich. Der Anarchismus erlaubt ja jedem weiterhin seine eigenen Systeme zu fahren (mal abgesehn von den System die wir schon haben, sind die anarchoszeneeigenen ""Subanarchismen"" erschreckend/absurd genug). Das würde früher oder später wieder zu den alten Problemen führen.

Damit man Anarchie überhaupt etablieren könnte, müsste die Menschheit einen geradezu evolutionären Schritt vollziehen. Ein Schritt der diverse menschliche Aspekte wie Gier oder den natürlichen Drang nach Macht abstellen. So etwas kannst du nicht aus dem Anarchismus herraus entwickeln. Das muss schon vorher in einem System passieren der einfach an einem Zeitpunkt überflüssig wird. Weil die Leute sich selbst organisieren oder wie auch immer. Ich finde, im Gegensatz zu den so populär gewordenen schwarz/roten ""Anarchisten""  eine Demokratie 2.0 würde uns besser darauf vorbereiten als ein Sozialismus 2.0 (auch wenn viele vom Kommunismus 2.0 reden, der wird, wie schon der Erfinder sagte, nicht möglich sein wenn nicht alle mitmachen). 

Daher mag Anarchie eine schöne Utopie sein für die Zukunft. Ein evolutionäres Ziel für die Menschheit in einer weit weit entfernten Zukunft. In unserer Lebenszeit ist das jedoch keine Option auf die man im Moment Zeit verschwenden sollte.

true,Taenk,GERM,"For a democratic, European confederation","My criticism is that the US American federal government is too powerful compared to national governments. Though there are clauses restricting the rights of the federal government, these rules are easily bent. A prime example is the clause that any commerce having nothing to do with interstate commerce is exclusively a matter of the individual state. The supreme court ruled then that a law incentivising local trade reduces interstate commerce by reducing it, thus being a matter of federal law. Admittedly, this is a particular ruling of the supreme court and not an inherent feature of a federal structure, but it shows what can happen.

Another thing you can see is when you put the USA 1774 and 2013 next to each other. The federal government has grown massively. Maybe this growth and centralization of power is an inherent feature of federal structures? The starkest contrast is the extent of the military. While for quite a while there was no standing army, the USA pays for the largest, admittedly most capable and most expensive military in the world. Again, not inherent in a federation, but it certainly does not hinder such developments.

Ultimately, my argument against federalism is one against a centralization of powers. The more control a central government - **any** central government - has over more subjects, the more lives will be affected by a mistake. Distribution of powers mitigates this by reducing the number of affected people. A prime example of this is the prohibition of alcohol in the USA at the beginning of the 20th century. A horrible, horrible thing for the population that could have been massively smaller in scale if the federal government didn't have such powers.",0,1365940867,null,0,false,0,c9ex3b8,t3_1ca55w,t1_c9ex3b8,t1_c9ewyi1,null,1431562446,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Yeah, but they don't want to do this and try to avoid those kinds of situations if they can. It doesn't look good on the books and most banks in Germany afaik don't sell your mortgages off like they did in the US. That is one reason why the home loan crisis in Germany wasn't really much of an issue.

&gt; I agree with your points, though, except maybe the family thing.

None of those points are deal breakers. They are just multiple factors that are used by the bank in order to determine what kind of a risk you are.

The funny thing is that instead of making people think about what happens when the power of States is not really constrained by supranational rules, and the chaos it causes, it made people think that intergovernmentalism is the answer.

I disagree. I think a huge reason why austerity is failing is because you have the private sector deleveraging at the same time as the public sector. Printing money until the private sector has done most of it's deleveraging would actually be great.  
  
Even if you don't actually print money, that option should also be on the table, as that would automatically lower interest rates as there would be no risk of defaulting when you can actually print. Low interest rates due to this can be seen in the US.

true,bbmm,null,null,"&gt; Though there are clauses restricting the rights of the federal government, these rules are easily bent.

Not easily.  I'd say at a huge cost.  By having a constitution that is very hard to change you're shifting the pressure from the legislature to the constitutional court which inevitably buckles.  

&gt; A prime example is the clause that any commerce having nothing to do with interstate commerce is exclusively a matter of the individual state.

Right and the judges had to to be threatened to do it.  Once it was done, it became celebrated by sections of the intelligentsia so the discourse is now  warped as well.  This is the kind of cost that's hidden.  

&gt; Admittedly, this is a particular ruling of the supreme court and not an inherent feature of a federal structure, but it shows what can happen.

I agree.  It seems once the power is there people will be motivated to use it and once they use it it triggers a process that's self-justifying in a way and changes the culture too.

&gt; Maybe this growth and centralization of power is an inherent feature of federal structures? 

I suspect the same thing and I'll add.  I think this is observable even in non-EU Turkey, given that it's a poorer country and both Brussels and Strasbourg (ECHR) wield considerable, asymmetric power.  People, academics, NGOs chase EU funds and just that process alone robs the society of the local talent who would observe and perhaps complain or warn about the potential problems inherent in having power shift away and get centralized.  Outside of any specific applications of power this process itself has long term consequences in the sense that we lose the ability to talk about this in a way.  (Generalize that 'we' -- it isn't specific to Turks.)

Going back to the US, Eisenhower, [in his famous farewell speech](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/eisenhower001.asp), recognized this:

&gt;**The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.** Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientifictechnological elite.

What basis do you have for that? The only two countries that Russia openly cares about are Ukraine and Belarus. 

&gt;They have already been doing it through export prices 
      
They sold Ukraine gas at an ally price and when they did want to be friendly anymore they offered them the market price, on top of that Ukraine had huge debts already.

Money is neutral, printing more of it won't make society wealthier.

&gt;I think a huge reason why austerity is failing is because you have the private sector deleveraging at the same time as the public sector.

Or you could cut taxes. A lower corporate tax and a lower vat would do wonders for the private sector.

It's certainly not enough for us, we still have plenty of restrictions on issues such as licensing reducing entrance in the marketplace, price controls in certain sectors, restrictive labour laws, a justice system that takes years to decide something even on the most trivial of cases, plenty of bureaucracy and standards which must be met to open and run a business, yada yada, and so it won't be by simply lower the rates that instant growth would come, but yeah, cutting taxes and dealing with these structural problems would be solving most of the issue.

&gt;Printing money until the private sector has done most of it's deleveraging would actually be great. 

I also favour printing money as opposed to taxing but that's simply from a personal perspective - I'm young and my savings are meaningless, I'm much more affected by high tax rates than by high inflation.

However, from a global perspective, I'm well aware this isn't a solution, not only it isn't politically feasible with the ECB and the rest of countries of Europe having an aged population, it would also set a bad precedent, I can't just think about me and I certainly must also consider the long run - if I do get to grow old, I'd also hate it if my savings where eaten away by inflation.

&gt;Even if you don't actually print money, that option should also be on the table, as that would automatically lower interest rates as there would be no risk of defaulting when you can actually print.

Lower interest rates isn't necessarily good either. And again that's just short term, on the long run real interest rates are the same regardless of the amount of money in circulation, the most one can do is lower them on the short run but increase them nominally on the long run as people also take expected inflation into account.

Do take the ""we must lower interest rates"" argument with some caution, on the long run that just leads to higher inflation and higher nominal interest rates. Not to mention that plenty of people who do make such suggestions have hardly any money deposited in banks but rather have them invested in securities such as bonds and therefore would only benefit if the interest rates were lowered on the short term.

&gt;Some inflation would also do wonders for our debt.

You also legally can't throw out Cyprus from the EU -- and we'd also have a few of the anti-euro countries defend us at that point at an EU level. You also likely will be too busy dealing with the new eurozone problems at that point rather than Cyprus. Your move.

Reminder: using the 'North Cyprus' card will involve the UN (read: Russia, USA) and making an even bigger clusterfuck and likely make Greece angry as well. It makes a good poker bluff, but it's not practical for the EU.

tl;dr: Political nightmare with Cyprus likely having the upper hand overall. UK and Greece almost certain to back Cyprus for historical reasons. Priorities will become safeguarding the EU rather than the eurozone at that point.

Wikipedia dice:

&gt;Il Prodotto Interno Lordo[1] (PIL, in inglese gross domestic product o GDP) è il valore totale dei beni e servizi prodotti in un Paese da parte di operatori economici residenti e non residenti nel corso di un anno, e destinati al consumo dell'acquirente finale, agli investimenti privati e pubblici, alle esportazioni nette (esportazioni totali meno importazioni totali). Non viene quindi conteggiata la produzione destinata ai consumi intermedi di beni e servizi consumati e trasformati nel processo produttivo per ottenere nuovi beni e servizi.

fonte: http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodotto_interno_lordo

Gradirei sapere come ha fatto il conto per capire cosa è calato tra:
- Consumi finali (come intendevano alzarli in 1 mese e mezzo?)
- Spesa dello stato (che non è necessariamente un male)
- Investimenti 
- la differenza tra esportazioni ed importazioni.

Top stories at the moment are often about Peer Steinbrück or about a new party, the AfD.

Steinbrück is Merkels challenger, candidate of the social democrats (SPD). He's not much loved among his own base, thus blamed for the SPD's currently rather poor performance in the polls. If the elections were held any time soon, the most likely result imo would be another Grand Coalition CDU/SPD, with Merkel staying in office.

The AfD is a new party in the making, hasn't been in any election yet. Founded by a bunch of economics professors, their only widely known position is that they want to abolish the Euro in some sort of orderly fashion. Since this is a popular opinion (chiefly, but not exclusively, among conservatives) they might actually clear the 5% hurdle and get some seats in the Bundestag.

Allerdings würd ich daraus dann eher *Geschlechterquote* machen, weil das ansonsten wirklich nicht mit Art. 3 GG vereinbar wäre (falls es überhaupt ein Unternehmen gibt, in dem nicht der Großteil der Vorstandsmitglieder und Verwaltungsräte männlich sind...)

Ich gehe mal die Kritikpunkte des Autors durch und zeige auf, warum das aus meiner Sicht absoluter Humbug ist:

&gt; Gleichstellungspolitik bricht mit dem Leistungsprinzip

&gt;Um eine berufliche Karriere erfolgreich zu bewältigen, sind Qualifikation und Leistung notwendig und unverzichtbar. Deshalb ist und bleibt es prinzipiell sinnvoll, berufliche Positionen überall den jeweils bestqualifizierten Personen zu geben.

Das Leistungsprinzip würde in einer idealen Welt gelten. In der realen Welt tut es das aber nicht (vollständig). Würde das Leistungsprinzip gelten, gäbe es das [Peter-Prinzip](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Prinzip) ja beispielsweise auch nicht. Es kommt eben nicht (nur) darauf an, *was* man *kann*, sondern besonders darauf an *wen* man *kennt*. 

Kleines Beispiel: Kandidat A und Kandidat B bewerben sich bei einer Firma. Die Studienabschlusses von Kandidat A ist 1,7 und der von Kandidat B ist 2,3. Kandidat B's Vater hat bis zu seiner Rente bei der Firma gearbeitet. Der Personalchef kannte B's Vater aber noch und hat mit ihm ein gutes, kollegiales Verhältnis gehabt. Kandidat A hat keinerlei Verbindung zur Firma. Für wen wird der Personalchef sich wohl entscheiden?
Über *Networking* gibt es etliche wissenschaftliche Studien und das ist auch seit etlichen Jahren bekannt.

&gt; Gleichstellungspolitik ist ungerecht

&gt; Sie nimmt erstens die verfassungswidrige Diskriminierung von Männern nicht nur billigend hin, sondern sie betreibt sie vorsätzlich, während sie gleichzeitig eben dies verleugnet.

Ist sie nicht. Hier eine Erklärung warum nicht: Stellt euch mal vor, ihr wärt Vorstandsvorsitzender bei einer großen Firma. In einem Jahr wollt ihr in Rente gehen, also schaut ihr euch nach möglichen Nachfolgern um. Auch hier ist das *Networking* wieder sehr wichtig, aber das lassen wir jetzt mal außen vor. Ihr sucht also nach einem Nachfolger - wie sollte er/sie sein? Am Besten ja exakt so, wie ihr! Denn ihr glaubt von euch selbst, dass ihr euren Job gut gemacht habt und wer würde nicht jemanden einstellen, von dem man sagen kann ""Du erinnerst mich ein bisschen an mich, als ich in deinem Alter war""? Und auch wenn das blöd klingt - eines der (unbewussten) Auswahlkriterien ist einfach das Geschlecht.
Der Autor schreibt davor:

&gt; Denn: die Gleichberechtigung ist längst Wirklichkeit.

Komisch, dass Posten von Vorstandsvorsitzenden dann trotzdem noch immer zu 90% (habe keine konkrete Zahl, ist meine persönliche Schätzung) mit Männern besetzt sind, obwohl es etliche sehr gut qualifizierte Frauen gibt. Ich werfe niemandem vor, dass er sich so seinen Nachfolger sucht, aber das ist trotzdem ungerecht gegenüber Frauen und sollte daher korrigiert werden.

&gt; Gleichstellungspolitik bietet für die Unternehmen keine Vorteile

&gt; Die Behauptung, Unternehmen hätten durch vermehrte Aufnahme von Frauen in Leitungsgremien generell etwas zu gewinnen, ist weder begründet noch wahrscheinlich. Denn es liegt ohnehin im Interesse der Unternehmen, verfügbare, geeignete und bewährte Personen für Leitungspositionen zu gewinnen. Und deshalb besteht kein gleichstellungspolitischer Handlungsbedarf.

Doch, bietet es. Man muss nur mal über den eigenen Tellerrand hinausschauen, sowohl geographisch, als auch gedanklich. 

Schauen wir mal nach Norwegen. Dort hat der Staat eine gesetzliche Frauenquote verabschiedet. Und die Welt ist nicht untergegangen und die Unternehmen sind nicht reihenweise Pleite gegangen. Im Gegenteil, sie bezeugen sogar positive Wirkungen des höheren Frauenanteils.

Kleiner Exkurs: Wann ist ein Unternehmen besonders erfolgreich? Ein Unternehmen ist besonders erfolgreich, wenn es eine große Vielfalt bei den Beschäftigten gibt. Heißt also, dass es nicht nur junge oder alte Angestellt gibt, sondern junge **und** alte. Die jungen bringen neues Wissen und neue Ideen mit und die alten dafür Erfahrung. Das gleiche gilt für verschiedene ethnische Gruppen und natürlich auch für das Geschlecht. Ein Problem wird desto einfacher lösbar, je mehr *verschiedene* Blickwinkel man zu ihm einnehmen kann, denn desto mehr Lösungsansätze und Denkweisen ergeben sich.

Wenn ich zur Bundeswehr gehe und möchte, dass sie ""das Problem mit den Terroristen"" lösen, wird natürlich keiner auf die Idee kommen, dass ""wegballern"" vielleicht nicht die klügste/alleinige Lösung ist.

Gleichstellungspolitik ist eine Lobby- und Klientelpolitik für einen sehr kleinen Kreis von ~~Frauen~~ Männern aus oberen sozialen Schichten, denn nur für sie sind Führungspositionen überhaupt in Reichweite.

Hört sich keinen Meter falsch an, oder?

&gt; Die meisten Frauen haben von der Gleichstellungspolitik überhaupt keine Vorteile 

Stimmt - wir erlauben keine gleichgeschlechtliche Ehe, weil sowieso nur knapp 10% der Bevölkerung davon profitieren würden. Pressefreiheit verbieten wir auch, weil sowieso nur 0,1 % aller Deutschen von der Pressefreiheit profitieren (=Journalisten). Zu so einem Argument muss man wirklich nichts weiter sagen...

&gt; Gleichstellungspolitik sollte beendet werden

&gt;Die Gleichstellungspolitik ist rechtlich und moralisch unhaltbar.

Das Gegenteil ist der Fall. Ich halte eine Quotenregelung auch nicht für ein Allheilmittel, aber eine zeitlich begrenzte Regelung (z.B. 5 oder 10 Jahre) halte ich für sinnvoll. Manchmal muss man die Wirtschaft auch zu ihrem Glück zwingen.

Abgesehen mal davon, dass es noch immer lächerlich ist, dass Frauen im Schnitt 20% weniger für die gleiche fucking Arbeit bezahlt bekommen. Und mehrere Jahrtausende absolut gar nichts zu sagen hatten, weil ""der Mann"" zu entscheiden hatte.

Aus moralischem und rationalen Gründen ist eine gesetzliche Geschlechterquoten-Regelung also sinnvoll.",1,1365958384,null,0,false,0,c9f0z6g,t3_1c9qm5,t1_c9f0z6g,t3_1c9qm5,null,1431560615,-3,false,de,t5_22i0,-3

Foreign policy and trade, yes please. Science only on ultra-large scale like space programs. Education please not. I do not want to spark a discussion about these specific points, the research is extremely convoluted and muddy from interests influencing relevant research in one direction or another. The main point is that the specific rights the states delegate have to be democratically legitimized. Again, checks and balances.

true,sangalog,ITAL,Italy,"A European Central Bank survey shows that households in northern Europe have a much lower net wealth than those in southern Europe. Average German net assets per household are just under €200,000, while they are €300,000 in Spain and €670,000 in Cyprus. No, this not a typo.
German newspapers screamed that poor Germans are bailing out rich Cypriots. This interpretation is wrong but the truth behind these counter-intuitive findings is even more disturbing. What the survey shows is not wealth differentials but the de facto exchange rates between the eurozone economies. They are not measures of net wealth but of imbalances. And they are enormous.
Since the start of the eurozone, wages and consumer prices have remained broadly constant in Germany. In southern Europe, the general level of wages and prices has increased year-in, year-out. Over the period, this persistent inflation gap has led to a large discrepancy in asset prices. This is why an apartment in Milan costs much more than one in Munich, the city with the highest property prices in Germany. A German euro buys more real estate in Munich than an Italian euro buys in Milan.
In the frantic German debate about these figures, the focus is on median wealth – the statistic that pinpoints the exact middle if one was to rank households by wealth. Looking at the median, the gap becomes even more extreme. In countries with extremely large wealth differentials such as Germany, where a few super-rich people own a large share of the land and real estate, the median is significantly lower than the mean.
Measured in terms of the median, German households occupy the last place among all eurozone countries, with net wealth of a mere €51,000, while the median Cypriot household has net wealth of €267,000. The explanation for this gap is the low property ownership rate in Germany – well under 50 per cent. This means that the median German does not own a house, while the median Cypriot or Spaniard does.
The median is the statistic to quote when you want to say that your typical German is poorer than your typical Spaniard. But that is a meaningless statement because it is based on distributions within countries. If you want to compare across countries, it is better to take the mean. The gap is not quite as dramatic but it is still very large.
If mean German net wealth is €200,000 per household and mean Spanish net wealth is €300,000, and if I further believe that the Germans are not really less wealthy as a nation, measured per household, then this gap tells me the minimum extent by which Germany and Spain would need to adjust their real exchange rates.
In truth, the gap is likely to be larger. I happen to believe that your average German household is richer than the average Spanish household. If my assumption is right, then the imbalance between Germany and Spain, as expressed by those figures, would be even higher.
In a monetary union, adjustment can only occur through though real movements in wages and prices. Since Germany is not inflating, and is not likely to inflate in the future, I see no chance of that happening, even in the long run. My conclusion is that, in the long run, this adjustment will eventually happen through a nominal change in the exchange rates – which means that somebody has to quit the eurozone or resort to a parallel currency.
To put it another way: if the same unit of account gives us a higher wealth figure for Spain than for Germany, and when you also know that this cannot be true, then there must be something wrong with the unit of account. The other potential solution is that there could be a problem with the data, but I see no fault with the statistical techniques used by the ECB. Maybe they got the house prices wrong. Statisticians do have difficulty capturing the declines of house prices after bubbles. But this type of discrepancy could not account for such a wide gap.
Indeed, this view also ties in with anecdotal evidence. Looking back to 1999, my own experience was that restaurants and taxis in Berlin were cheaper than restaurants or taxis in Brussels or Paris, but the differences have now become extreme. Curiously, the price gap also affects tradeable goods: European cross-border retail markets are not working efficiently.
This leaves me to conclude that the unit of account is not really the same across the eurozone – that Spain and Germany have a different euro. This is also the reason why I believe southern Europeans have a rational reason to shift their savings to bank accounts in the north – because this would present the only way to preserve the value of their euros in the long run.
Of course, I would not expect the ECB or any other European institution to conclude that the euro is not the same in Germany as in Spain. It is their job to deny this. But the imposition of capital controls in Cyprus has set a precedent. It now has a new currency. I call it the Cypriot euro. According to the ECB’s study, Germany also has its own currency – the German euro – and it is massively undervalued.

&gt;By Edward Luce

&gt;When it comes to the labour market, America is suffering from a case of ‘German envy’

&gt;When asked by Tony Blair for the secret of her country’s resilience, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said: “We still make things.” It is a question you often hear in the US nowadays. It would be an exaggeration to say Germany is back in fashion. There is too much disapproval of Berlin’s handling of the eurozone crisis for that. Yet when it comes to the labour market, the US is suffering from a rising case of “German envy”, as one analyst puts it.

&gt;“People are continually asking me how we do it,” says Eric Spiegel, the US chief executive of Siemens , which has the distinction of being cited by Barack Obama in his last two State of the Union speeches. Getting a “shout out” from the US president may sound trivial – although executives at unuttered competitors, such as General Electric, do not see it that way. But Mr Obama was only repeating what was being widely said by many business leaders and trade unionists in the US. “Can we replicate the German model?” asks a centrist Democratic senator.

&gt;As a package, the answer is no. Germany channels roughly half of all high-school students into the vocational education stream from the age of 16. In the US that would be seen as too divisive, even un-American. More than 40 per cent of Germans become apprentices. Only 0.3 per cent of the US labour force does so. But with the US participation rate continuing to plummet – last month another 496,000 Americans gave up looking for work – many US politicians are scouring Germany for answers.

&gt;It is turning into something of a pilgrimage. Rick Snyder, the Republican governor of Michigan, and John Kasich, Republican governor of Ohio, have both recently toured vocational academies in Germany. The German embassy in Washington has even set up a programme called the “skills initiative” to cater to all the questions from the heartlands.

&gt;“The US is not a developing country so we don’t need to send teams of technical advisers into the field,” one German diplomat said. “We are just trying to respond to the curiosity about the German model.”

&gt;The longer the US recovery continues, the more that curiosity increases. The US faces a deepening mismatch between what its labour market needs and what the education system is producing. There are two sides to this paradox. First, the US is underskilled. It has high unemployment at a time when there are 3.5m job vacancies, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some economists argue that the US “skills gap” is imaginary – a shortage of engineers would have shown up in salary inflation, which has not happened. The average hourly cost of a US manufacturing worker is $32. In Germany it is $48. Yet US employers insist the shortage of skilled labour is a growing problem.

&gt;US states tend to outbid each other with tax breaks. This works well for casinos. But many states, such as Michigan and Ohio, are realising that what desirable investors most covet is skilled labour. According to the OECD, the US comes last out of 29 countries in terms of the work readiness of its high-school leavers. And 46 per cent of those who go to college fail to complete their four-year degree within six years. “Getting a tax holiday does not make up for having a bad business plan, it just delays the pain,” says a senior US executive at Daimler, the German carmaker, which has several US plants. “If you have a good plan, what you are really looking for is good people.”

&gt;Second, the US is overqualified. Almost half of Americans with a degree are in jobs that do not require one, according to a study by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. Fifteen per cent of taxi drivers in the US have a degree, up from 1 per cent in 1970. Likewise, 25 per cent of sales clerks are graduates, against 5 per cent in 1970. An astonishing 5 per cent of janitors now have a bachelor’s degree. They must offer endless nocturnal moments to repent those student loans. Only at the top of the system do the labour and education markets mesh well. PhDs and postgraduates are the only US category to enjoy rising incomes, often dramatically so.

&gt;For a company such as Siemens, which has 60,000 American employees and recently reintroduced train manufacturing to the US (in a plant near Sacramento), the answer is simple. The US needs to rejuvenate its community colleges, which offer two-year vocational degrees but are often starved of funds. And it needs to fall back in love with apprenticeships. Benjamin Franklin started off as a printer’s apprentice in Boston. Many US trade unions, such as the pipe fitters and boilermakers, used to train their own. Perhaps they should remember their history.

&gt;Siemens, meanwhile, is angling for a third Obama mention. The group recently had 2,000 applications for 50 vacancies in North Carolina. Only 10 per cent passed the aptitude test. At a cost of $165,000 an apprentice, Siemens is training six local high-school leavers in “mechatronics”, a hybrid of mechanical engineering and computer science. These are robot supervisors. The company hopes apprenticeships will catch on in the US. It graduates 10,000 a year in Germany, a country that seems to have fewer problems with the underskilled or the overqualified. “There is a great potential for the reshoring of manufacturing to the US,” Mr Spiegel says. “But if companies have problems finding qualified people, a lot of it won’t happen.”

Dude. Everyone with 2+ braincells knows this.

What is important is that we are dealing with the desires of around 3000 people and Argentina wants to ignore these people on the basis of an argument that has 0 credibility. You should not pander to anyone who wants to disrupt the lives of thousands of people for the sake of the misguided, nationalistic and illogical thoughts of a government.

There are times when it is fine to deal in absolutes. And it sounds pretty pseudo-intellectual to say that ""There are no absolutes."".

If someone is killed in cold-blood, then the murderer should be punished. No question. If a dictator commits racial genocide, then the dictator should be punished. No question. 

Why? Because there is no logical, moral argument to justify these actions. Give me a logical argument. And I'll listen to Argentina.

""What is right is merely what the most people deem acceptable.""

You honestly don't believe that hundreds of years of moral debate, knowledge from history and scientific analysis has anything to do with our moral compasses?

Non è il politico dei miei sogni, nel senso che lo trovo abbastanza populista e semplificatore su alcuni argomenti, ma sa parlare al paese reale che è quello che serve per vincere le elezioni (ma dai!). Nessun Bersani, D'Alema, Barca potrà mai far vincere il centrosinistra finché dall'altra parte c'è Berlusconi. Ci piaccia o meno, bisogna parlare a tutti e quindi imparare realisticamente a convincere chi l'altra volta non ti ha votato, invece che aspettare una conversione sulla via di Damasco. In una frase: una buona comunicazione politica serve e la sinistra italiana dovrebbe cominciare a sfruttarla invece che considerarla come qualcosa ""di destra"".
Questo è un discorso esclusivamente sulla ""forma"", sull'aspetto esteriore, ma sono convinto serva ANCHE questo - o soprattutto, in Italia? - per vincere le elezioni. 

Da suo elettore alle primarie (ero tra quel 40% che l'ha votato, non pochi) mi trovo d'accordo anche su molti temi che ha provato ad introdurre nella discussione della sinistra italiana. Proposte come: superamento bicameralismo perfetto, semi-presidenzialismo, introduzione legge elettorale maggioritaria doppio turno, ancoraggio all'Europa, digitalizzazione pubblica amministrazione, idee pro-concorrenza molto utili all'Italia soffocata dalle corporazioni.. etcetc

Non sopporto chi lo considera ""di destra"", ""berlusconiano"" o addirittura ""fascistoide"" a me sembra solo un buon personaggio, direi uno strumento, che se usato bene porterebbe finalmente il centrosinistra alla vittoria. Basterebbe solo un po' di senso del reale, osservare la società, perché no anticiparla, e non chiudersi in recinti identitari che dopo un po' cominciano a puzzare di vecchio.

Parce que le peuple, si tant est que le peuple existe, parce que le peuple, donc, préfère élire de parfaits gendre plutôt que des hommes soucieux du bien commun, probes, et aptes, il faudrait recourir au tirage au sort, à la main divine pour voir élire ces mêmes hommes qui ont fait preuve auparavant, en tant qu'électeurs de bien peu de sens commun ? Oh oui, ils élisent parfois des gens de biens, des hommes bons. Et ce quelque soit la couleur. Oh oui, mes voisins, des français sont des gens de bien. Mais lorsqu'il s'agit du bien de tous, sont-ils vraiment désintéressés ? ""Not in my backyard"" comme disent les anglais.

Que voilà une sage parole. Il est vrai que la République ne nous a pas envoyé à l'école, ne nous a pas protégé, ne nous a pas donné l'opportunité de lire, de nous associer avec d'autres français pour agir, pour faire le bien, pour protéger la nature, pour requérir, même, les tribunaux et obtenir des jugements. 

&gt; Pour reprendre la Constitution Francaise, ce qui devrait faire plaisir, ""gouvernement du peuple, par le peuple et pour le peuple.""
La constitution est-elle un texte qui nous condamne à ne plus agir ? Qui nous invite à l'inaction et l'oisiveté ? Qui nous dit ""cela a été fait"" ? Ou est-ce un texte qui nous invite à proclamer, en acte, par nos actes et nos votes, que le peuple doit être gouverné, se gouverner et cela pour lui ? N'est-ce pas plutôt un texte qui nous invite à conquérir cet état et à rester vigilant tant les hommes qui l'ont rédigé étaient au fait des plus bas instincts dont ont fait preuve certains politiques durant 2500 ans de démocratie ?

Sui contenuti: durante le primarie mi avevano convinto alcune suo proposte, anche perchè il programma di Bersani era pieno di ""impegni di principio"", mentre le sue erano proposte leggermente più chiare. Poi dalle proposte di un politico io cerco principalmente una cosa: idee chiare e convincenti su come diminuire il deficit senza aumentare le tasse. Renzi durante le primarie qualche ideuzza ce l'aveva, anche se nulla di eccezionale.

My prediction to a similar question regarding this recently (about one of the national parliaments vetoing the bailout):

&gt; Cyprus defaults, runs out of money -- has to print their own currency.. massive devaluation, imports will become expensive and there will be shortages but a proper reconstruction of the economy will now be able to take place. It will definitely be a bit shitty for a couple of years, but once we're past that phase and the currency starts strengthening again, we'll definitely be better off. Tourism will immediately become more competitive.

&gt; Oh and the best part is.. you guys still have to ""bailout"" the ECB, so we also get some entertainment from that :D

&gt;You also legally can't throw out Cyprus from the EU -- and we'd also have a few of the anti-euro countries defend us at that point at an EU level. You also likely will be too busy dealing with the new eurozone problems at that point rather than Cyprus. Your move.

&gt; Reminder: using the 'North Cyprus' card will involve the UN (read: Russia, USA) and making an even bigger clusterfuck and likely make Greece angry as well. It makes a good poker bluff, but it's not practical for the EU.

&gt; tl;dr: Political nightmare with Cyprus likely having the upper hand overall. UK and Greece almost certain to back Cyprus for historical reasons. Priorities will become safeguarding the EU rather than the eurozone at that point.

&gt; tl;dr tl;dr: extremely annoying and costly headache for everyone. In practice, whichever country votes no will likely have to keep voting until they say yes. I'm just daring you to veto it just so you see that your democracy doesn't matter any more than mine does :)

&gt; Expect a similar scenario to take place no matter which country it is.

&gt;   Erstens nervt es mich, dass fanatisch auf diese Vorstandsposten geschaut wird. Das macht von allen Führungspositionen nur einen winzigen Prozentsatz aus.

&gt; Zweitens ist das eine reine Vermutung von dir, eine Behauptung. Ich nehme für mich bspw. in Anspruch, dass ich mich von so etwas überhaupt nicht leiten lassen würde.


Es geht aber doch bei der Diskussion im Besonderen um diese Posten. Warum sollte ich mich also nicht auf diese konzentrieren?

Natürlich nimmst du es in Anspruch, aber - wie bereits von mir geschrieben - geschieht das eben in der Regel unterbewusst. Daran ist erst einmal nichts schlimmes, weil es - wie du sagst - menschlich ist. Es ist aber nichtsdestotrotz Frauen gegenüber unfair, wenn sie deshalb eine Stelle nicht bekommen für die sie aber qualifiziert wären.

&gt; Die Aussage allerdings, dass es etliche sehr gut qualifizierte Frauen gibt, ist eine reine Behauptung. Wie viele Lebensläufe von potentiellen Vorstandsfrauen hast du denn gelesen und mit Lebensläufen von (potentiellen) Vorstandsmännern verglichen? Das würde mich wirklich mal interessieren.

Wie viele hast du denn gelesen? Hier steht einfach Behauptung gegen Behauptung. Denk, was du möchtest, aber ich kenne genug bestens qualifizierte Frauen (natürlich auch genug bestens qualifizierte Männer).

&gt; Ich weise vor diesem Hintergrund erneut darauf hin, dass hier völlig zu Unrecht nur auf die Vorstandsposten geschaut wird. Männer stellen ja nicht nur die großen Gewinner in unserer Kultur, sondern auch die großen Verlierer: Gefängnisinsassen, Obdachlose, Schulabbrecher, Arbeitsunfalltote usw. sind Gruppen, die mehrheitlich, teilweise über 90% männlich sind.

Achso - und weil die Männer sowohl die reichsten und die ärmsten sind und Frauen eben irgendwo in der Mitte rumdümpeln ist es okay, wenn sie aus Prinzip schlechter gestellt sind bei der Vergabe solcher Jobs?

&gt; Diese positiven Wirkungen wurden inzwischen durch weitere Studien widerlegt.

Dann zeig mal her. Ich kenne zwei Studien zu den Wirkungen der norwegischen Quote und dort heißt es, dass sie den Effekt gemessen hätten, dass kurzfristige Gewinne der Unternehmen zurückgingen und prinzipiell weniger Leute entlassen wurden.

Das sind alles andere als schlechte Wirkungen.

&gt; Klar. Und Männer haben sich sowieso gegen Frauen verschworen.

Eliten wollen immer unter sich bleiben. Sonst würden die Eliten ja an Einfluss oder Macht verlieren. Nichts überraschendes.


&gt; Dem ist aber nicht so, auch wenn einige unwissenschaftliche Studien mit radikalfeministischen Auftraggebern ein anderes Bild zeichnen.

Aha. Dann zeig mal her.

&gt; Bei den 20% geht es eben gerade nicht um die gleiche Arbeit, sondern um die Gesamtsumme, die Frauen und Männer verdienen. Wenn man wirklich umfassend alle Faktoren (Beruf, Position, Erfahrung, ...) berücksichtigt, so schrumpft der Lohnunterschied erst auf lächerliche 4-8% und verschwindet dann völlig.

The ""fundamental contradiction"" comes from the fact that you can't have voters and shareholders decide at the same time. Modern democracies have shareholders at the mercy of voters, but voters allow shareholders a great deal of freedom in most areas. That's probably okay, as long as shareholders (i.e. the plutocracy) don't hold power that affects the basic rights of voters, effectively subjugating voters to shareholders.

The main differences between some societies and ideologies (e.g. US vs. classic EU welfare) can be found in the balance between the voters' power and the shareholders' power. It could be argued that the shareholders hold greater power in the US than in many parts of the EU. I would argue that one primary task of the EU is to ensure that voters in all member countries do not have their power limited by financial interests. Not happening at the moment, let me tell you that…

Cyprus also has a history of having an extremely stable currency with a lot of purchasing power and low inflation before the euro. The currency will definitely be screwed in the short term, but it may be possible to convince people that it'll be a good long term investment.

The political instability has always been a factor and will remain a factor for now, and so far it hadn't stopped anybody from investing. At the end of the day, what will matter is how it will go down and how public opinion will see it as there are definitely ways that the euro will be seen as being at fault -- this will mostly be determined by the ""markets"", who have been expecting to see a eurozone nation default for a while now... profits can definitely be generated for ""them"".

I am going to present two scenarios for you, you can decide for yourself which is more likely to be true: 

1) Norway has some of the strictest air pollution laws in the world (owing to a huge problem with acidic rain last century, much of which was from dirty British industry). Norway also has international obligations to lower it's CO2 output, this is a problem because Norway is a) cold and b) a massive oil producer. One of the solutions has been that Sweden has built several incineration plants and Norway is paying Sweden to dispose of its waste. That way both countries can benefit. Norway, which is one of the richest countries in the world owing to its oil,  pays to keep the incinerators on and out of the country. Sweden has the benefits of a little bit more income, can locate the incinerators away from large centers of population (not difficult) and has cheaper energy as a result. Therefore Sweden built too much incinerator capacity for just Sweden.
 

2) Sweden now recycles so efficiently that it is forced to beg other countries to dispose of their waste in order to keep the lights on. 


The tendency in the American liberal press to place Sweden on some kind of weird pedestal leads me to believe that scenario 1 is more likely to have actually happened than scenario 2.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Norway has some of the strictest air pollution laws in the world (owing to a huge problem with acidic rain last century, much of which was from dirty British industry).

So do we. It has been an enormous problem for us. 80 % of the winds in the Northern Hemispere comes from the west.

&gt;Norway also has international obligations to lower it's CO2 output, this is a problem because Norway is a) cold and massive oil producer.

So, do we, not the oil, but it is of lesser importance significance, since not all the  oil in that sense gets ""calculated"" when it gets taken up. Also, Norway stores its CO2 which you might not know, and then it gets removed from the calculation. Sweden on the other hand has more people and more industries. Also, Norway, like Sweden, use a lot of water power. In fact, Norway uses a massive 96 %, we only half of that (damn fjords....).

Also, our (Sweden and Norways) laws with regards to CO2, garbage etc are fairly similar. 

&gt;Sweden has the benefits of a little bit more income, can locate the incinerators away from large centers of population (not difficult) and has cheaper energy as a result.

No, almost all of them are in the south, in the most populated areas, and fairly close too, Stockholm, Göteborg and Helsingborg comes to mind. Also, almost all the electricity up north (where you indicated they should be since it is empty up there) comes from water, 48 % of the Swedish energy is water energy. 

I have done several visits to those incinirator plants and they clean the air obviously, so it doesn't really matter that it is close to cities, it is within the guidelines (which as you pointed out, are strict). We have more problems with spiked tires in Stockholm :-).

&gt;Therefore Sweden built too much incinerator capacity for just Sweden.

No, we have to little incinirator capacity, or it depends on how you mean. If it is wrong to use incinirators, then we have to much obviously, but since Sweden has decided that this is an OK way to use garbage, we do not. It was started as a way of effectively using our own waste, but we were just more effective than we thought.

Oviously, it is not an ideal solution, but the landfills also produces methane, which is worse, and well, they are ugly landfills too. One of the issues that has been debated in Sweden is how much we should import. The pro -people says that it is better that we deal with it and ""clean"" it, than for example Lithuania or whathever the last country were that we wanted to import from. The no -people (really just the green party) says it is wrong to produce CO2 always, even if we clean it,and we should always stop and preferably make others stop too(they always says that). 

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12bvve/garbage_engineer_from_sweden_ask_me_anything/) is an IAMA from a Swedish garbage engineer you might find interesting. 


I am an environmental scientist and I think I can safely say that the number one is wrong, in that sense that it was never a plan. It is also decided on a local municipal level, so it couldn't really be ""a plan"", unless you got a lot of different cities to agree (and keep quiet) about it.  

It is number two.

I have understood that it only works in cold climates, but I haven't really understood why more countries, like (parts of ) the US, UK, France etc does this. It is really quite neat, and I have become rather fond of garbage places, something I didn't really believe a few years back :-)

You know the transport companies don't get a direct share of the stuff they're transporting? Everything that is manufactured in The Netherlands that does not go to the European mainland will pretty much be shipped somewhere via Rotterdam. Current export numbers are $556.5 billion (2012 est.), mainly machinery and equipment, chemicals, fuels; foodstuffs, with Main export partners: Germany 25.4%, Belgium 13.7%, France 8.9%, United Kingdom 8.8%, Italy 5.2%. A huge portion of that 556 billion will pass through Rotterdam. 



&gt;The economy is noted for stable industrial relations, fairly low unemployment and inflation, a sizable current account surplus, and **an important role as a European transportation hub**. Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly mechanised agricultural sector employs no more than 2% of the labour force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports. 

I don't even know why were discussing this.. one of the key points here is that the Dutch ecomomy is different in the way it is set up from that of Spain (and also Norway, for that matter); and export (for which the Port of Rotterdam is very import) is a large contributer to Dutch economic growth.

Historical insight:

The hash trade was dominated by Christiania, where the bikers had set up shop. Crime and violence *was* involved, but it mostly took place outside of Christiania (except for the crime of selling weed, but, you know), and Christiania had a self-imposed ban on hard drugs. (So you could buy joints, hash, skunk, Psylocibin mushrooms, but no speed, E, Coke or similar.

The police raided Christiania, and removed the hash-trade.

Many dealerships sprung up all over the city, with no self-imposed restrictions.

Turf warfare started - there have been some shootings for the last couple of years. Between 2008 and 2010, there's been 100 shootings, 7 killed and 55 wounded.

There's been increased police presence, certain areas have been declared ""visitation-zones"" (so when you're there, the police *can* search you for no reason)

Some of the gangs that have started as a result of this, have started claiming ""protection money"" from local shops and business.

----

Since this is all a result of the hash-trade (initially), some politicians in the municipality of Copenhagen want to reform the hash-trade, to remove the money from the criminals. The assumed amount of money spent on the black market is 1.5 billion dkk. (300 million USD) in Copenhagen alone.

Its the only nation in the world were its completely legal, would be an easy export for them, can be bought for a good price and still sold for profit and might provide and exit strategy for the current tensions as well as employment opportunity for its population in high end agriculture, it could also be a path for North Korea to open up to the world without leaving behind its heritage, although it would have to work abolish its camps and engage in better human rights to satisfy stoners. 

Mr Un should seriously consider such things as the profits could directly translate to more wealth for his country without completely opening his borders nor depleting any local resources he and his ruling party are short of. The wealth could then if directed correctly translate into purchasing power for food and resources for his people given him better standing which would in turn be more supportive of any action he wanted to undertake. 

Although i am not in support of war or aggression it is understandable that a nation like his would feel considerable tension by the current powers which to be honest are struggling to maintain their own internal issues while have harsh rhetoric with other countries.

I believe North Korea could be a dominate player in the world if it recognized the strength it has as both an intellectual, communal and enduring labor force. The down side to its current status is the military seems to be the key employer for its people which creates a problem when there is really no active need for way in our current globalized environment. Employing people in weed agriculture would relieve the military of its burden to keep order and employment up. And thus allowing North Korea to be less prone to harsh rhetoric in order to sustain its military and employment. This employment shift also means less generals which means less chance you will suffer a coup in the near future as i imagine you are regard as less capable due to your age among your peers and advisers, always remember when the shit hits the fan most troops look only to the next one up, not to the top.  

Mr Un please consider a future were you are a part of this world, inherently i understand you and your peoples displeasure with this scenario, however you could turn it on its head and demand a nuclear free status like New Zealand effectively barring all international military vessels and air force as most major military will neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear capability on individual ships and bases, simultaneously you would be halting the capacity for South Korea and Japan to deploy such weapons and limit China's ability to have these in your area as well, forcing all players to maintain only conventional military which you could rival so that you may not feel in a lesser position if that is important to you.

Lastly to make a turn around based on such a move would be seen as highly liberal, would completely diffuse tension across the world, would make everyone look foolish, would force America to return to base. 

Furthermore you are instantly removing the need to fight the sanctions imposed on you, you do not need to open up at all your market in the sense of foreign investment, you can keep your borders closed still if you wish and would be involved in an integral trade agreement with a respected European nation which seriously limits any foreign aggression. 

Get on this band wagon early North Korea, you are in a good position to take advantage of growing demand for legitimate bulk weed as more places around the world legalize as the conservative nature of our governments give way to the more free market quasi socialist liberal future of the youth of the many western and European nations.

A lockout isn't a ""strike"" per sé, it's the employer deciding to not **allow** people to work, so it's the employers ""striking"". The municipals union (KL - Kommunernes Landsforening/Municipals National Union) aren't allowing any teachers to work. This is bad, as you might expect. It means that all primary schools are closed, and the same thing with boarding schools (students may be allowed to live there, but classes have been discontinued). This is especially stupid since it's so close to examn time.

Now, as for who's in the right... That depends. Do you believe that teachers should have to work in school 37(40 in reality) hours a week, rather than having 37 hours a week for teaching + preperation, forcing them to do their preperations in school, while teaching (remember, students will also have to go to school 40 hours a week. Previously, you went to school at a max of 35 hours a week (if 7 hours/5 days), 8 hours a day means that there's less time for sports, and any homework outside of school is on top of that (rather than supposed to fill out the ""remaining"" hours to 40 hours)).

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's a bit more complicated. AFAIK the essence of the German model is that your fate is more or less decided at the age of 14 - high school more or less makes it sure that you get to a university and when not, you have a big problem. Trade schools give you a trade, but no maturity exams, so no uni. German employers often tend to be very education focused in the sene that for example when an Aussie guy in /r/germany looked for a programming job, he assumed a system where you achievements determine your salary, and was surprised to find that in the German logic, what matters is whether you have a relevant university degree or not. German employers are often vary of self-taught programmers and other people, meaning it is difficult to change careers. So often your life, your ""social class"" is determined at 14. The good side is that people get very good, useful, practical training, matches with the job market. **The bad side is that it kind of cements in a hierarchical system.**

The American education system is **something sort of an egalitarian dream that went dysfunctional**. In America everybody goes to high schools, the same kind although not the same quality (public / private, and in public, the location, rich or poor neighborhood matters a LOT), but the same kind, and theoretically the future Hardvard grad lawyer and the future car mechanic could sit side by side in an American high school. (Practically unlikely, but anyway.) And it is the general high school that may or may not offer woodworking, metalworking, automotive etc. classes on the side. The future mechanic may take this class, if it exists, or may be entirely trained on the job. 

Because the trade education of the mechanic is by no means as sure and organized as in Germany, one unexpected result is the following: 

America has a big business focus because **if employers are expected to turn untrained or half-trained employees into car mechanics and suchlike, it is generally the biggest ones that can organize it.** So an egalitarian education system actually results in a hierarchical business.

**Germany, Austria, even Hungary or Poland can allow itself more of a small business focus precisely because of the trade education system**. You can hire anyone with a trade school degree - or very often simply offer the job to an apprentice - without much further degree. This makes it easy for the small business to expand, and to have a fairly decentralized management structure - **no need for prescribing every tiny work step like McDonalds, you can trust in your people's knowledge** -  I have often seen this attitude in Austria and presumably Germany is the same that a new hire can be given a complex task and expected to do it in a ""industry standard way"" i.e. school way i.e. ""Sach"" way ""Sachbearbeiter"", ""Sachkenntnis"", roughly translatable as ""professionally, as taught at school"". There is a lot of pride behind these words. 

This hands-off, ""you are expected to know how to do it"" management means it is fairly easy for an experienced car mechanic to start their own business, and thus there is a less ""corporatized"" and more ""small business system"". 

Ultimately the German system preserved the good aspects of the old Medieval guilds where a properly schooled, trained blue collar person is a fairly respectable, a ""master"", and sooner or later should have some fair chance to become independent and not forever an employee.

This quasi-medievalism is even more noticable  in Austria where often e.g. a carpenter business is not advertised as a faceless business but as ""Günther Pfuscher certified carpenter meister"" and his employees. Who one day want to have their own business too.  Very much a guild feeling. BTW I don't say ""medievalism"" in the bad sense, I like it. I think in many ways the guilds were a better system than corporations.

The American system is based on the idea of some aspect of equality and non hierarchization until the age of 18, this ""general high school with optional metalworking, or automotive classes"" but it ends up generating more hierarchy later on. America has the kind of philosophy where there is a hierarchy of money, but there is no serious hierarchy of professions. In America a clever plumber who gets rich is just equal to the lawyer who gets rich. Rich is rich, poor is poor. European cultures often have a class hierarchy rooted in the professions themselves, that is not 100% coupled with how much you earn. And industrial alpinist (those brave folks who clean high rise buildings and factory tower chimneys hanging on a rope) may make a shitload of money, but kind of still kind of seen as lower class, lower compared to the badly paid librarian. Kind of.

The huge disadvantage of the German-Austrian-etc. system is that it is very hard to change professions later on. For example my wife (we live in Austria, we are Hungarians) is a gastro technician (so super-high-school in culinary, kinda), and is fed up with kitchens, wants to do a logistics job like warehouse, like quality control of incoming goods, she even did a forklift certification, but apparently every employer thinks if you have a gastro schooling and 10+ years of experience in it then you should stay in it forever.",0,1366013568,null,0,1366014275,0,c9fhluu,t3_1cca6c,t1_c9fhluu,t3_1cca6c,null,1431552634,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

This is typically something people of the intellectual kinds get wrong: that if people will have a lot of free time, they will do a lot of awesome creative stuff. Judging from the retired people in my family, outside the intellectual circles it actually means a lot of TV and drinking yourself to death. So the question is, how can we _force_ people do to do something meaningful, something like a job, once automatization takes away the economic excuse for it? Because we still have to, because otherwise we will get meaningless, drinking, drug using, street fighting lives, because this is what happens when simple people get bored, but it will be much harder to find an excuse for it. 

I am afraid that if not enough thought is given to it, it will mean war. Because whenever simple people get bored, they get violent, and the historical way to deal with large numbers of violent simpletons is to recruit and  send them to fight somewhere else  - in France the perfect example is the Legion. 

If you don't want this you need to find a way to force people to do sensible stuff that takes up their time and staves away boredom and gives a feeling of achievement, without war.

Maybe some kind of a civil service...

Hey, I am an intellectual and even I would drink myself to death if economics would not force me to work!

I may disagree with our 'causing public offence' laws or drugs laws or tax laws. But I know that if I break these laws, I will be punished, regardless of how regressive they may seem to me. The gent, knowing what the situation is like in Turkey, quite likely knew what he was doing and wanted to make a point. Which he did rather successfully, judging by the coverage this is getting. 

Finally, 'right' versus 'wrong' is an entirely abstract concept. You may *believe* something is right, but that doesn't make it right. I am sure you will find plenty of people who deem anti-blasphemy laws 'right' as much as you deem them 'wrong'. The point of democracy is to see which viewpoint has majority backing. The people of Turkey seem to have decided that anti-blasphemy laws reflect their popular opinion and I respect that, even if I disagree.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  AFAIK the essence of the German model is that your fate is more or less decided at the age of 14

Actually as early as after primary school (i.e., after 4th or 6th grade, depending on your state). That's when classes get split up along the three (or two, again depending on state) tiers of our antiquated school system.  
Your future isn't set in stone at this point, you can still continue in a more academic tier after graduating from a ""lower"" one or go on to study after your apprenticeship, but it's tough.

One of the aspects that I find problematic with this is that it really does split society into tiers, not just the class you went to primary school with. In the US, you might still have that high school friend who went on to become a mechanic, while in Germany you tend to know almost exclusively people who have a similar level of education as yourself.

&gt;  I have often seen this attitude in Austria and presumably Germany is the same that a new hire can be given a complex task and expected to do it in a ""industry standard way""

Yes, there is much less need for top-down supervision. What's more, there's a better chance for bottom-up innovation; they don't just know *how* to do something, but *why*, and this means they're much better equipped to suggest ways to improve your product or procedures.

&gt; And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant's wreath and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.

You should add that nonetheless there are more and more opportunities for these people to reach a universtity degree via the so called 'zweiter Bildungsweg' ('Duales Studium' is another).

With apprenticeship plus Fachhochschulreife (2-3 years of school to reach admission or by getting your 'Meister') you can apply to a Technical University/Fachhochschule and become a bachelor or master in one out of many disciplines.

I think it's a good way to to give kids from low income and/or immigrant families who have been struggleing to get a proper education at young age the opportunity to aim for 'more' when they are older.

It's also true that in some particular cases, an immigrant might refuse to follow the local laws, which also makes his integration difficult.

Still, for the most part, I think lack of integration of minorities is nobody's fault, it just is what it is. There's many locals who have the idea that by coming to their country, immigrants somehow have the responsibility to adapt to the local lifestyle and customs. However, while that level of integration could be desirable, there's no such obligation; when an immigrant arrives to a country, they are just accepting to comply with the local laws, and as long as they do, they can live however they want (just like a local can). The issue becomes apparent when there's enough immigrants from similar backgrounds to form communities they feel comfortable in, thus decreasing the incentive to adapt to the local culture; and they are well within their right to do so.",0,1366023890,null,0,false,0,c9fiuyw,t3_1cdp7z,t1_c9fiuyw,t3_1cdp7z,null,1431552044,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
