[Yes](http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/specific-co2-emissions-per-passenger-3). That is, you'll use more in (most) cars if you drive on your own, but if you take a passenger with you on that 1000km trip, almost all cars will [emit less](http://www.carpages.co.uk/co2/). By train your emissions will only be a third of those of a plane.

The real difference, though, is that you probably won't drive 1000km for a night out, but people are beginning to do just that by plane. Those €40 are sometimes more than the ticket itself.

However....I think as many other Northern countries, the Netherlands might have suffered from the ""progress complex"". In the 60s, people divided into those who fought for equality and civil rights, and the conservatives.
Somehow, instead of convincing through their damn right arguments, the fighters for equality started to use the ""modern/progress"" argument. If you are against us, you are for going back in time. Many conservatives felt horrified. Nobody wants de-growth, in-volution, and stuff like that. Thus the narrative became ""you gotta think that or you're an old alien"".

In the end many say they are for gender equality, but they don't know WHY. Or HOW. And they keep raising their daughters telling them they gotta be nice, they doll them up. Sure, they tell them they have to study and get a job, but basically teaching them to ""seduce to obtain"", with a pretty smile to everybody. You gotta be nice to yyour teacher, nice to your peers you gotta say always yes. And yes, the way you look is important. And oh yes, you NEED to have an intense emotional life, or you're NOT a woman.
 
On the other hand, they keep teaching their boys that they don't have a role in the house, they cannot be nurturing fathers, they cannot cry, they don't NEED an emotional life, and well....they basically leave them without any conscience of what their role or goals are in their life.

Gender equality is achieved only when people see other people as PEOPLE, not as genders. When boys can cry and ask for help, and girls don't feel like they have to please everybody or feels like they have failed if they are not in a relationship.

I can sympathize with this point of view if you were talking about the Tuareg rebellion, but that's not the case. Mali started out as a fight for Tuareg self-determination against the central government *(the match was sparked by Tuareg mercenaries, who were hired by Gaddafi to put down protests, returning home from Libya after it's government fell with a bunch of new training and weapons)*. If this was the case, than that would be fine, as we would have no place in it, as it's a fight for self-determination. 

But it wasn't long before foreign extremists flooded into the country after the Tuaregs had asked a few for military assistance, hijacked the Tuareg rebellion and made it their own personal jihad. *This* was when France finally got involved. And why you have seen the French extending an olive branch to some Tuareg groups, and vice versa. 

So now you got this weird situation in Mali, where it's foriegners *(the French)* fighting foriegners *(the extremists/jihadists)*, with the Tuaregs and Malians....who the war was initially fought between....awkwardly caught in the middle. But the public, in general, actually widely support the French when compared to the extremists, as I've mentioned before, because they are mostly moderates, and they especially dislike the extremists for trying to harshly impose Sharia law and destroying Malian cultural artifacts and heritage that they've deemed *""heretical""*.

Remember that most of EU was against Ukraine's bid to join NATO back in 2008. US and UK supported the NATO bid, but Germany and France and others did not want to be confrontational against Russia.

The EU neighborhood policy aims to push for democratic/judicial reforms and free trade in it's neighborhood. This interest is colliding with Russian interests at the moment, but pushing back Russia was never a goal in itself.

The ultimate goal of the EU enlargement policy would be to *include* Russia in the Union, sometime in the distant future.

Here a quote from WP about the situation in Germany:

&gt; Zu den rechtspopulistischen Parteien in Deutschland werden unter anderem Die Republikaner, Statt Partei, Bund freier Bürger, Partei Rechtsstaatlicher Offensive und Pro Köln gezählt. Im Vergleich mit rechtspopulistischen Parteien in anderen westeuropäischen Ländern ist diese Strömung in Deutschland eher erfolglos. Dies wird in der sozialwissenschaftlichen Debatte mit dem Unvermögen der bisherigen rechtspopulistischen Parteien, das auch in Deutschland vorhandene Wählerpotential auszuschöpfen, erklärt. Als Gründe werden hierfür unter anderem die Unfähigkeit der rechtspopulistischen Akteure, das Fehlen einer überzeugenden Führungspersönlichkeit und die durch die deutsche Geschichte geprägte politische Kultur genannt

The American GDP growth is 2.2%. The European Union GDP growth is .2%. So, that means our economy is growing at 10x greater rate. Now, if only 15% is not going to the rich and big businesses, than that means the remaining growth is like .3% or something *(which is still more growth than the E.U.'s GDP's growth in it's entirety)*, or for your worker wages figure, .03% growth. But we've been out of the recession for a couple years, the European Union only left it in August. So you have a couple years of additional growth, however small, and a couple years of negative growth for the European Union.

Which is fine. But you're also trying to say that no money goes to the super-rich and big businesses in the European Union? All the GDP growth in the E.U. is going to worker wages, and not to big businesses or the rich? **Get out of here man**. So now I want you to factor in the same equation *(even if it's reduced in favor of the European Union)* you did for the U.S. GDP growth for the E.U.'s GDP growth *(which is only .2% overall atm)*. 

And when you do that, the United States is *still in better shape than Europe in that regard.*  ",0,1385208030,null,0,1385227102,0,cdl4o6u,t3_1r8haa,t1_cdl4o6u,t1_cdl4l5r,null,1428540524,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Il problema se vuoi (le perle ai porci per restare in tema) è la stessa natura umana - chi cerca di ottenere il potere è la persona meno adatta per amministrarlo - indipendentemente dalle modalità con cui lo ottiene.

Chiaro che appendere tutti ai ganci per poi, lasciando passare abbastanza tempo, ritrovarsi gli stessi maiali con altri corpi non fa differenza.

Da filosofo l' unica cosa che posso dire è che (per assurdo) la soluzione meno violenta è quella della violenza *adesso*. Più si aspetta più la violenza sarà incontrollata e sarà a discapito di chi non è responsabile.

The times I would have been able to pick up a girl, I always noticed the problem of a high dude-per-girl-ratio, meaning about four shitfaced guys tried to get a girl by any means possible at a time, just as you described your visits.

The time of when people go usually depends on when the clubs open and on wether there are bonuses for early visitors (like ""a few free drinks if you're here at 10PM"") or not. Usually, people decide to go there way after 12am, ranging from 12.30am to 1.30am, but not much later since people tend to start to leave around 2.30am at latest. But there will always be people that stay until the club closes down, so you're not gonna be alone - possibly just with the guys that will try to scrap up the incredibly drunk girls from the floor and try to make out with them.

(Che poi è il motivo per l'endemicità di certe situazioni.)

La verità è che il Guardasigilli che fa uscire di galera il parente dell'amico è _esattamente_ la stessa cosa dell'amico dell'impiegato alla posta che salta la fila, dell'amico del vigile urbano che si fa togliere la multa.

No, “la gente” non è stufa, è solo imbecilmente sorpresa del fatto che, finito il periodo di vacche grasse, non si possa piú parassitare come era abituata a fare.

Che sia fango vero o merda metaforica, è comunque un danno che ti sei andato a cercare.

E la verità è che “la gente” non ha alcun senso della responsabilità, perché nonostante tutto è piú comodo, è piú pratico. “La gente” non vuole risolvere i problemi, vuole qualcuno che glieli risolva.

true,ravenren,POLA,Polan the Stronkest,"&gt;Inspired by many sources 

q: how exactly do you get inspired by something that you learn *after* the fact?

a: you don't.

his true and first inspiration was the instrument called *claviolin* built by Jan Jarmusiewicz, he loved the idea and then discovered Da Vinci's project, when he decided to build it he learned about Haiden.

&gt;When I came across Father Jarmusiewicz’s claviolin, I started intensive research and soon found some historical materials which were absolutely sensational for me. I realised that this instrument had been invented, named “viola organista” and sketched by Leonardo da Vinci himself!  
(...)  
Over time, I discovered that the first ever maker of viola organistas, then called the Geigenwerk, was Hans Haiden, an artisan from Nuremberg. Sources give various numbers of the instruments he built; some say he made as many as 32 instruments, but in fact only two are documented: the first from 1570 and a revised model from 1600. None of them has survived.   

and then:

&gt;A description of Haiden’s instrument with its sound characteristics and musical properties is contained in Syntagma Musicum by Michael Praetorius, published in 1618. Once I’d read it, I was enchanted. The instrument promised to be a revelation, it was universal, combining the best features of various types of instruments: it produced a continuous sound like an organ, it had the sound of bowed string instruments, and you could play vibrato on it. It was a unique synthesis of harpsichord, positive organ and bowed string instruments. In a typical baroque manner, Praetorius wrote that it could play urban music, rural music, it could express various feelings, and even imitate the sound of a drunken man. I then realised that this was a unique situation: I would be able to play a repertoire which is practically unavailable to a pianist – the works of the great literature for viola da gamba [the viola da gamba was the predecessor of the cello – ed.].

he was *encouraged* by Praetorius' description of Haiden's instrument that had the same qualities that this of Leonardo's project. but he had decided to build it before he even knew about Haiden.

&gt;The only surviving instrument was made in 1625, on the model of Haiden’s viola, by a Spanish craftsman, Raymundo Truchado. It is preserved in the Musical Instrument Museum in Brussels.  
**Have you seen it?**  
Yes, I have examined it in detail and made many photos of it. In a way I did it illegally, because I crossed the barriers separating the exhibit from the visitors. I didn’t like this instrument at all. To put it bluntly – it’s ugly.

not much of an inspiration, *huh*?

Eine Arznei ist nicht deshalb wirksam, weil sie eine chemische Wirkung im Körper hat. Jedenfalls nicht nach medizinischer Sichtweise. Eine Arznei (nach medizinischer Sichtweise) ist dann wirksam, wenn sie eine Besserung der Erkrankung bewirkt. Deshalb gibt es gerade unter Ärzten viele Fans von Homöoptathie und anderen alternativen Therapien. Sie intervenieren mit diesen Therapien bei ihren Patienten und sehen eine Wirkung. Das ist das, was ein Arzt macht. 

Und im Vergleich zwischen Placebos und den derzeit auf dem Markt befindlichen Antidepressiva (die chemischen) gibt es nach einem breiten Vergleich der doppelblind-Studien keinen statistisch relevanten Unterschied. Wobei, und das fand ich besonders interessant, es dann einen stärkeren Unterschied gab, wenn die Nebenwirkungen (Übelkeit) zunahmen. Also eine chemische Wirkung auf den Körper.

Shouldn't be much of a problem though in Heidelberg, given the military presence and the university population.

Resultiert aus Armut auch Depression und/oder sind Depressionen eine Mitursache von Armut? Ich bejahe beides (keine Quellen aus Zeitmangel).

Na, ich meine mal gelesen zu haben, dass depressive Reaktionen letztlich eine Schutzfunktion des Körpers sind. Man nimmt wahr, dass man in grosser Gefahr ist und nicht in der Lage ist sich der Gefahr zu stellen. Also minimiert der Körper den Ressourcenverbrauch. Das Problem ist hierbei das dies in der modernen Gesellschaft eher schlecht funktioniert. Wenn du deine Miete nicht zahlen kannst verfällst du in Depression weil du dich ohmächtig fühlst. Das ist aber eben die falsche Strategie. Ähnlich bei sozialen Dingen. Wenn man sich nicht geliebt oder verstanden fühlt und ausgegrenzt wird oder sich abgrenzt dann fällt es schwer wieder reinzukommen. 

Wenn ich mich richtig erinnere, war die Metapher ungefähr, dass man sich von seiner Gruppe getrennt hatte und die logische Reaktion war möglichst viel Energie zu sparen bis die die Gruppe einen wieder findet. Nunja so eine halbwegs große Stadt macht das alles etwas komplizierter. 

Aber ich bin da eher skeptisch, dass klingt alles zu schön um eventuell wirklich wahr zu sein.

**Doing business 2014 - Understanding regulations for small and medium-size enterprises (The world bank)** [PDF](http://www.doingbusiness.org/~/media/GIAWB/Doing%20Business/Documents/Annual-Reports/English/DB14-Full-Report.pdf)

Doing Business 2014 is the 11th in a series 
of annual reports investigating the regulations that enhance business activity 
and those that constrain it. 

Doing Business 
presents quantitative indicators on 
business regulations and the protection 
of property rights that can be compared 
across 189 economies—from Afghani-stan to Zimbabwe—and over time. 

Regulations afecting 11 areas of the 
life of a business are covered: starting 
a business, dealing with construction 
permits, getting electricity, registering 
property, getting credit, protecting 
investors, paying taxes, trading across 
borders, enforcing contracts, resolving 
insolvency and employing workers. The 
employing workers data are not includ-ed in this year’s ranking on the ease of 
doing business.


Through its indicators  Doing Business 
measures and tracks changes in the 
regulations applying to domestic small 
and medium-size companies, operating 
in the largest business city of each economy, in 10 areas in their life cycle: starting 
a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting investors, 
paying taxes, trading across borders, en-forcing contracts and resolving insolvency. The aggregate ranking on the ease of 
doing business is based on these indicators.

 
Doing Business  also documents regulations on employing workers, which are 
not included in the aggregate ranking. In 
addition,  Doing Business  tracks good practices around the world to provide insights 
into how governments have improved the 
regulatory environment in the past in the 
areas that it measures (see table 1.5 at the 
end of this overview).
Regulations that protect consumers, 
shareholders and the public without overburdening firms help create an environment where the private sector can thrive. 

Sound business regulation requires both 
eicient procedures and strong institutions that establish transparent and enforceable rules.  Doing Business  measures 
both these elements: through indicators 
relating to the strength of legal institutions relevant to business regulation and 
through indicators relating to the com-plexity and cost of regulatory processes. 

The indicators in the first group measure 
the strength of the legal and regulatory 
framework for getting credit, protecting 
investors, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency. Those in the second group 
measure the cost and efficiency of regulatory processes for starting a  business, 
dealing with construction permits, getting 
electricity, registering property, paying 
taxes and trading across borders. 

Based 
on time-and-motion case studies from 
the perspective of the business, these 
indicators measure the procedures, time 
and cost required to complete a  transaction in accordance with the relevant 
regulations (for a detailed explanation of 
the  Doing Business  methodology, see the 
data notes and the chapter “About  Doing 
Business”).

Doing Business  is not about less regulation 
but about better regulation. Accordingly, some  Doing Business indicators give 
a higher score for better and more developed regulation, as the protecting investors indicators do for stricter disclosure 
requirements for related-party transactions. Other indicators, such as those 
on dealing with construction permits, 
automatically assign the lowest score to
economies that have no regulations in the 
area being measured or do not apply their 
regulations (considered “no practice” 
economies), penalizing them for lacking 
appropriate regulation.

The economies ranking highest on the 
ease of doing business therefore are not 
those with no regulation but those whose 
governments have managed to create 
a regulatory system that facilitates interactions in the marketplace and protects 
important public interests without unnecessarily hindering the development of the 
private sector—in other words, a regulatory system with strong institutions and 
low transactions costs (table  1.1). These 
economies all have both a well-developed 
private sector and a  reasonably efficient 
regulatory system that has managed to 
strike a  sensible balance between the 
protections that good rules provide and 
the need to have a  dynamic private sec-tor unhindered by excessively burden-some regulations.",0,1385225976,null,0,false,0,cdl8l36,t3_1raewk,t1_cdl8l36,t3_1raewk,null,1428538627,20,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,20

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; The use of rank rather than any of the (albite subjective) values attributed to each country does kind of reinforce the lack of value of the resulting graphic though.

The values aren't entirely subjective, they seem actually to have a metric for each category, often involving 'Time to Complete' and 'Associated Costs'. For instance, on 'Getting Electricity', [here's Iceland's page](http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/iceland/#getting-electricity) and [here's Poland's page](http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/poland/#getting-electricity). Connecting electricity in Poland takes 161 days, and costs 200% of income per capita; the equivalent in Iceland is 14 days, and 14%. 

I agree with your point about ranking, in the sense that, in theory, there could be little variation between the best and the worst, and using a rank would be needlessly stigmatizing. And of course a lot of this is political to one degree or another. Still, a fair amount of it does seem to be useful and valid in the sense of simple good practice. For instance, in the section above, it gives the best rating to a well-run public service, and gives a much lower rating to a poorly set-up but privatized system.

 16-18 are forbidden form entering nightclubs/bars. 

I do not know the official difference between a disco and a nightclub (probably what/if alcohol is served); but the timelimit at 24°° is annoying, and some discos might just bar you entry, because they would have to make sure you leave at 24°°, and that you are not sold any Coctails etc.

If you want to go into a disco, your ID card should be enough - if it states your date of birth (your image does not?).

Of course in the UK the choices are only closer ties to the EU or even closer ties to the America and more wars if the far right anti-EU/conservatives got their way. So it's a shitty choice too, but still one where the EU ends up looking better than the alternative.

I don't really know what to think, but I imagine for Eastern Europe sending soldiers all over Muslim countries fighting for America/Israel and doing whatever they say is still better than being under the Russian yoke. Plus they tend to have fairly racist populations so they probably love the US and its desire to constantly fight those deemed as others.

You age is definitely a problem. Their are only 3 larger clubs in Lübeck:

- the [A1](http://www.a1-musikpark.de/) is 18+ only and the security checks most people
- the [Hüx](http://www.huex.de/) is 18+ but I've never been their
- the [Parkhaus](http://www.parkhaus.tv/) is also 18+ but if you look old enough I would say that you could be lucky (also I've no 1st hand knowledge - I'm way to old ;) )

This aside you may want to try the following location

- the [Brauberger](http://www.brauberger.de/) is a pub that brews it's own beer (which is very good but you will get a headache if you drink to much). The owner is a very nice guy and the crowd is very mixed. They will most likely not check you ID and even if they do: Beer is legal at 16 in Germany and they will most likely don't throw you out at midnight
- the [Blauer Engel](http://blauerengel-luebeck.de/wordpress_e/) is a student...um...well: It looks like a living room and they sell drinks. Sometimes there are small concerts, poetry slams or readings. Most of the crowd will be students from the local university so they will be only slightly older than you and you will most likely don't get your ID checked. 

Rule of thumb: The larger something is, the more likely they won't let you in. Especially if they have professional security at the doors. And even if you would travel to Hamburg/Bremen/etc.

This all said: If they really don't sell you any strong beverage or asked you to leave don't cause trouble. Oh, and don't drink to much.

In order to face down the Eurosceptics, there is a danger that social democrats and liberals in the European Parliament will huddle in a “Europe Cartel” – thereby losing the ability to articulate real differences about the future direction of Europe. This would create a situation where the main political cleavages in Europe are between pro-European elite and Eurosceptic populists, rather than between left-wing and right-wing visions of Europe.

The answer is for the mainstream parties to engage in this debate before it becomes the sole preserve of populists. If democracy is to mean anything in Europe it has to mean that the degree of federalization is subject to intense and continuous public debate. The idea that 'ever closer union' should be above debate is completely absurd, and if large sections of the European elites continue to adopt this position, they will make the whole union a brittle construction, liable to snap.",0,1385234856,null,0,false,0,cdlbku7,t3_1raodq,t1_cdlbku7,t3_1raodq,null,1428537230,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

Haven't you had for example pro-LGBT rights rallies in the Netherlands? An example of demonstrations for something, to publicly voice support for something.

Those pro-EU demonstrators have massed a rally to show their support for aligning with the EU because Moldova has not done it yet. In a sense, if you like, you might see that as an act of complaining about the lack of progress on the issue. Or you could see it as an act to show support for the government's aspirations - as the government also wants to and says it will continue to pursue association with the EU. 

Either way I don't see people rallying and publicly voicing their opinion as suspicious activity. Considering history associating with the EU is a big, indeed historical, step for Moldova and the situation may be tense and even precarious so people feel the need to publicly show their stance. 

And I cannot see anything inherently wrong in people rallying to demostrate support for something they see as important (and TBH it really surprises me that it's a Dutch thing to see such as suspicious).",0,1385237603,null,0,false,0,cdlcj72,t3_1rao0d,t1_cdlcj72,t1_cdl9zn6,null,1428536785,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Seems that compared to 2013 Austria has not improved as much as other high-income countries and has dropped by two ranks to #30.

I don't think there's something *wrong* with Austria. Perhaps she just momentarily forgot the Red Queen's Race:

Non c'è moltissimo, a dire il vero. Però c'è sempre vita intorno al centro, se ti piace la birra puoi andare all'Open Baladin (generalmente è sempre pieno, però in mezzo alla settimana è fattibile). Per tutto il resto, dai un'occhiata su [Zero](http://roma.zero.eu/) e avrai una panoramica degli eventi maggiori.

&gt;Dove è meglio girare, nel caso?
Quali sono i quartieri più vivi durante i giorni lavorativi?

Eviterei le zone troppo periferiche, se non altro perchè non c'è moltissimo (a parte i parchi, che però con questo tempo ti sconsiglierei). Direi che Monti/Pigneto/San Lorenzo/Trastevere/Testaccio/Ghetto sono le zone che preferisco girare di più: sono belle, tipiche, ognuna con delle caratteristiche sue. Girarle a piedi è un piacere, se il tempo lo consente.

&gt;In che zona consigliereste di prenotate l'hotel/b&amp;b?

Eviterei le zone troppo turistiche. Degli amici americani (che attualmente hanno il cambio a sfavore) hanno trovato un albergo vicino a Via Cola di Rienzo e mi hanno detto che non hanno pagato molto, nonostante sia molto vicina al Vaticano. Altrimenti direi quartiere San Giovanni/Appio Latino, ci sono diversi B&amp;B e sei vicinissimo alla Metro A e al centro. Il prezzo è medio.

&gt;Valgono ancora i consigli datati nel thread dei ristoranti? Magari alcuni locali hanno chiuso/son peggiorati...

Io ti consiglio di farti un giro per la città e fermarti dove pensi che sia buono. Al Ghetto ebraico (pieno centro) ci sono diversi forni che fanno roba buonissima e genuina. Prova la cacio e pepe da Felice a Testaccio, prova le vere trattorie romane, vai al locale di Roma dell'Antica Focacceria di San Francesco (vicino al Parlamento): si mangia bene e si spende il giusto (è un po' stile tavola calda con le tovagliette di carta, però con i camerieri, e il locale è pulito e carino).

&gt;Quali sono le cose/i posti da visitare e da vedere che molte persone non sanno e che consigliereste?

A me piace moltissimo passeggiare per i quartieri. Le strade intorno a Via del Corso (altezza P.zza del Popolo) sono bellissime. Anche i vicoli di Monti intorno a via Nazionale sono molto belli, con quei bei rampicanti verdi che avvolgono lampioni e palazzi e fili elettrici. Non conosco i tuoi gusti, quindi non so cosa consigliarti. A Roma c'è un po' di tutto, quindi se ti fai un giro su internet riguardo i tuoi interessi, secondo me qualcosa trovi.

&gt;Pensavo di andare ai primi di dicembre, così da (ri)vedere anche la città in clima natalizio.

Dio sia con te: è più caotica in clima natalizio. Però ai primi di Dicembre ancora non c'è la febbre degli acquisti (che poi con questa crisi è calata parecchio), quindi magari potresti trovarla piacevole.

&gt;Parlando di clima, come si sta? Io vengo dal nord quindi non ho problemi a portare vestiti pesanti, il problema è che non vorrei portare vestiti troppo pesanti.

E' umido. Al momento oscilla tra i 12°-13° di media durante il giorno, di notte scende parecchio. Se hai un buon maglione e una giacca antivento stai tranquillo.

Come la vuoi chiamare quella della Germania? Svalutazione interna? Svalutazione reale? Svalutazione dei salari? Dumping salariale? Fatto sta che la Germania ha praticato una politica massiccia di svalutazione reale attraverso un un programma di sussidi diretti e indiretti (la famosa *flexsecurity*, grazie alla quale più di 7 milioni di tedeschi ora lavorano a €400 al mese) proprio mentre predicava rigore fiscale per i Paesi esteri.

&gt;Sotto la spinta di una disoccupazione elevata e rigida, il governo Schröder iniziò a partire dal 2003 una serie di riforme
del mercato del lavoro, riducendo efficacemente i salari di ingresso nella porzione meno avvantaggiata del mercato del
lavoro. […] In parte queste riforme erano state motivate dal fatto che i tassi di cambio nominali erano stati fissi dal 1995,
nel percorso verso l’euro. […] La svalutazione interna veniva quindi vista come il solo modo per ristabilire quella che
veniva considerata una situazione più equa. Tuttavia, la maggior parte delle riforme portò a deflazione salariale nel
settore dei servizi, nel quale vennero creati nuovi posti di lavoro prevalentemente a basso salario. […] Al contempo, poco
è stato fatto per ripristinare la competitività in termini di incrementi della produttività. In effetti, lo sviluppo della produttività
è rimasto in linea con la media europea. Queste politiche di deflazione salariale non hanno solo influenzato i consumi
privati, la cui crescita è rimasta indietro rispetto a quella dei consumi degli altri Paesi dell’Eurozona di più di un punto
percentuale dal 1995 al 2001. Hanno anche portato a una crescente disuguaglianza dei redditi, a una velocità mai vista,
nemmeno subito dopo la riunificazione, quando milioni di persone persero il proprio lavoro in Germania Est. A livello
europeo, questa politica ha creato le condizioni per una depressione economica prolungata, dato che gli altri Paesi
membri sono sempre più spinti a vedere la soluzione dei propri problemi di competitività in una deflazione salariale
ancora più rude.

Questo pezzo sopra non l'ho scritto io, eh. È dell'International Labour Office dell'ONU (2012).

Ricordo che nel trattato di Maastricht è scritto che le politiche fiscali devono essere decise insieme proprio per non causare squilibri:

&gt;Articolo 2 - La Comunità ha il compito di promuovere, mediante l’instaurazione di un mercato comune e di un’unione
economica e monetaria e mediante l’attuazione delle politiche e delle azioni comuni di cui agli articoli 3 e 3A, uno
*sviluppo armonioso ed equilibrato delle attività economiche nell’insieme della Comunità*, una crescita sostenibile, non
inflazionistica e che rispetti l’ambiente, un elevato grado di convergenza dei risultati economici, un elevato livello di
occupazione e di protezione sociale, il miglioramento del tenore e della qualità della vita, la coesione economica e
sociale e la solidarietà tra gli Stati membri.

&gt;Articolo 3 A 1. Ai fini enunciati all’articolo 2, l’azione degli Stati membri e della Comunità comprende, alle condizioni e
secondo il ritmo previsti dal presente trattato, l’adozione di una politica economica che è fondata sullo *stretto
coordinamento delle politiche economiche degli Stati membri*, sul mercato interno e sulla *definizione di obiettivi
comuni*, condotta conformemente al principio di un’economia di mercato aperta e in libera concorrenza.

At some point during the cold war in west there was even a opposite catchphrase 'better red than dead' meaning that it would be better to surrender to the Soviet threat than risk a nuclear war.

Both of them are oversimplifying catchphrases with black-and-white dichotomy and it's just sad that only objection to them is a possible relation to fucking Goebbels.

If I walked up to a person and put a gun up against their head, 99% would shit their pants and then proceed to eat that shit if I told them that's how they were going to survive the encounter. Death is not a joke, if you've seen it (especially if it was a close family member), it's not pretty and although I am not afraid of death, I am certainly afraid of the process of dying. 

Moreover, I remember my grandparents who lived in Briceni talking about their parents and their own grandparents living in Moldova. The Romanian ethnic majority in their village would lord over them and do as they pleased. They had police that killed young men occasionally and did things that made the local Ukrainian/Russian minority loathe them very much. In WWII many Romanians welcomed fascism. My grandfather remembers how his best friend and his family and all the village Jews were massacred at the bathhouse by the Romanians. My grandfather was 14, he watched his best friend get rifle-butted to death whist screaming because his arm was blown off. I'm sorry if I don't feel sympathetic about Romania's fate after WWII under communism. It is a wonder my grandparents survived, as my grandmother was Jewish, but she did, since she was married to my Russian grandfather. 

Ironically, my grandparents were born in a village comprised of German immigrants from the 19th century and most people traced their ancestry back to Germany. Most were Jews of course. Tsarist Russia may have been ugly, but in the end their native Germany killed the village and slaughtered most of the inhabitants. With Romanian hands, of course. But under German direction. My great-grandparents who were Gentiles did not fare much better. Three out of four laid their lives fighting Germans. Two of them we never got their bodies. One because there was literally not a piece left, the other buried in a mass grave somewhere in Belarus.

It would hinder us, yes, but not stop us, and it would deal a huge blow to the associated power projection (Mali, Libya, Kosovo) Europe possesses through U.S. support**

The strategic advantage that our bases in Europe provide us are essential, no doubt, but they are *also* there to aid NATO, which does entail protection, but also power projection like Libya, Mali &amp; Kosovo. 

There are military cuts being taken by almost every European country, most worryingly the United Kingdom and France, the only other two besides the United States with actual power projection. Because of European underspending on their military *(which I admit, is probably linked to American overspending)*, these bases are critical when the E.U. actually wants to launch a peacekeeping mission *(Kosovo)*, no-fly zone *(Libya)* or intervention like in Mali by invoking NATO, and by extension, America. 

What I'm trying to say is if we were just utilizing these bases just as supply depots and transit stations, we could do it with a lot less men, and a lot less resources invested.

&gt; No wars in the middle east without Rammstein Airbase or the base(es) in turkey.

That's not true. We have a global network of bases, from Djibouti to Qatar to Guam, and dozens in-between. The strategic advantages that the European bases provide us should not be understated, but they should not be overstated either. 

Those bases I listed above, in addition to our strategic transport capability air-wise *(largest in the world IIRC)*, [aircraft carriers](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/carriers-2012.gif), nuclear submarines *(which can sneak right up and lob dozens of cruise missiles)*, air-to-air refueling planes *(also the most in the world IIRC)* and B2 bombers which can take off in Iowa, strike anywhere in the world, and return to Iowa, afford us the ability to hit the Middle East without those bases. I mean hell, our navy's battlefleet is as large as the next 13 countries combined, the United States Air Force is the world's largest airforce and the United States Naval Air Force is the world's 2nd largest air force. 

It would be a little more difficult, but not impossible nor improbable. We have the world's largest logistical network/capability, and the most effective power projection. 

You also discount major allies in the region who we could use for bases, like Israel, whom bases I have no doubt we would be allowed to use in a emergency.  ",0,1385248600,null,0,1385249046,0,cdlgg59,t3_1r8haa,t1_cdlgg59,t1_cdlfv8a,null,1428534885,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

true,[deleted],null,null,"I disagree.

Political transformations too complicated to justify to ordinary people have happened all through history.For example, I highly doubt that ordinary people knew much of what the Magna Carta is, Independence from the British Empire means, or had much influence over the formation of Germany.

Complicated political transformations are the reason why we have representative democracy and not direct democracy.It's fundamental to moving forward as a society,rather than waiting for the last man in the country that can yell the loudest to change his view.

""The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.""

This is a good short clip on the topic : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6gZvEAjGHw 

In the case of the EU and mandate from electorates, this is a view that only exists within the UK. Look into each national Parliament and you will find qualified majorities in each country and in each house of Parliament that views the EU in favorable terms.You will not find many other things on which those parties agree on to the same extent.

The mandate from the electorate is there, has always been since the begining. The people who oppose the EU have always existed, will continue to exist. The difference now is that,as before they represented a unsignificant minority, now due to the economic crisis they have become more noticeable and influential. As soon as the economic crisis is over and things improve the support for them will die off. 

Secondly, I agree that not everyone who disagrees with federalization is a nationalist and a fascist.There are legitimate concerns to be addressed, and as you said , the EU should remain a union of nation states. The debate is centered around what type of Union (federal / confederal), what type of powers should be delegated to what level ,and so on. This is not something that the parties in question are addressing. There has no initiative from them for a constructive debate, or an initiative of EU reform.Everything from that side of the political spectrum has been solely about the relevant nation-state.

However, thirdly, I agree and disagree. 

National parties have failed to communicate with the electorate , and it's the reason why you have such discontent now.It's an unfortunate time , mostly caused by economic hardship.I expect things to change as the economies recover, and they should obviously do a better job at communicating with the people and ensure democratic representation within national parliaments.

We won't reach a common ground on the euroskeptic parties that I mentioned. They are nothing more than populists wanting to get votes based on the discontent of the population with the status-quo, and are willing to sell the population anything.Geert Wilders is a very good example of this. What happens to sell is the sense of national unity and a common demonizing institution / other group.It's been done before, and is something that has happened so many times in history that it's embarrassing that we still haven't learned anything from it.

You cannot possibly claim that they represent the voice of reasoned debate and have an intention to reform the EU for something better when their political agenda is what it is, and is aimed solely at the national level and centered around nationalism. 

I find it ironic how often matters that deal with politics are completely the opposite of what they claim to be.For example,as the case for Democratic People's Republic of Korea , People's Republic of China, or US and it's land of the brave home of the free motto. I think the same applies here with the euroskpetic parties and your claim of competent, well intended parties that want to make Europe more democratic,free and better.",0,1385248685,null,0,1385251631,0,cdlgh5o,t3_1raodq,t1_cdlgh5o,t1_cdlejtb,null,1428534873,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Don't forget that the question in the polls is EU membership, not what they were about to sign. The fact that 37% people think that Ukraine can become a full member after 5 years just shows how uninformed they are. If both EU and Ukrainian specialists made analysis and showed what's going to happen to Ukraine in the short term without financial aid (as well as from having bad relations with Russia), people would be against this AA and trade treaty with EU. 

Again, the EU is not seriously considering Ukraine's membership right now. So such polls are useless.

Not sure where you are getting this from -- on my father's side my grandmother's father and her uncle both received 5yr sentences for various speculation-related activities, seeing how they were 'kulaks' and owned quite a bit of cattle. They both came back. 

You must be a kid or a teen to talk so lightly of death. Try having a loved one maybe, see if it changes your outlook on death. When you are married you will go through anything just to be with your wife and kids, if you have them. Even if your chances were smaller, you'd still take them just for that small chance in the end to see your loved ones. But people didn't go into gulags expecting to die, unless they received long sentences. It was extremely hard labour, and depending on your assignment you may be in a place where lot of people die (think White Sea canal for instance) but to say that all gulags were certain slow and painful death is just uninformed. 

You know, the Jews in Germany still went into concentration and death camps without committing suicide, surely that's a good indication of the human will to live?

true,pfdwxenon,null,null,"As someone who did some interviews in recent times I´ll try to give you some kind of run-through.

First they will most likely tell you the proceedings of the interview. Most of the times it´s structured like this:

1.) Tell us your cv and explain why you did choose what you did. This depends naturally from the length of your past experineces. But it´s the part you can prepare . Most likely they want you to tell this in German - althoug it´s certainly true that they don´t expect perfect german for an engineering position and they should be quite aware of your skills and your mothertongue as you stated that in your cv, right? (right?!!)
 To give you a lil confidence-boost: It´s very likely that they prefere a non-german for the sake of multi-culture teams - and so it´s perfectly ok when you show your willingness to be able to speak german (Know football? See Pep Guardiola in an german intervoiew? That´s what I´m talking about). So if you miss some words - that´s ok.

More important here: Know your weakness, and know your ""weaker"" decisions. Never go along ""Well I didn´t have much better to do than that"" (But that seems obvious.)

Best: Train the run-thorugh of your cv pointing out the best and most ""recognizable"" things you do and focus on them, tell them why you did what you did and what your achievments have been.

Be prepared for some questions about your cv while your talking. Depends on what kind of person is interviewing you, if thos questions might be of a ""stress-test"" style bitchy questions - learn to deal with that - keep confident and take your time answering - don´t shout out the first idead in your mind.

2.)Next (might also be this is the first part...depends). They will tell you some boiler-plate stuff about the company, and afterwards about the position.

Here comes the part, when they might expect YOU to tell THEM some things about the company (what you know about Osram). I do think to remember that Osram is a quite conservative company. Whatever happens. Have your facts straight there.

Then the questions part. VERY important that you think abvout questions that you can ask them. Think about the team, the organizational structure, the amount of in-office/travel-time,the options for in-company learning (Fortbildung), company strategy, department strategy, number of non-german natives working there (they´ll be surely opened to that question).
DO NOT ask about money - you already stated what you want to earn in your ""bewerbung"" if not - not a big deal: they will ask YOU.

Be prepared to come up with a clear number - no excuses, no ""I don´t know"". You know your value - tell them. Go about 10-15% above what you expect to earn (don´t shoot through the roof there though).

And always the last question of you should be what are the next steps and till when. Know this is Germany, be straigth forward about the schedule. Just shows your determination and makes them think you might have other opportunities to consider ;-)

Back to your main english/german question:

1.) Be prepared that everybody speaks much better english than you do speak german - good for you.
2.) Don´t go in the interview at the very beginning and tell them ""Could I do it in english?"" Try to go thorugh at least your cv in german (you can train that - do it!), they will offer you to go on in english and it won´t be embarrassing to accept - again...this is germany. People tell you quite straigth forward what they offer and when they do they mean it ;-)
3.) If you miss words - noproblem...it´s about willingness to communicte in german - not about perfect german.
4.) Good luck to you sir ;-)

edit: terminology 

Although I've exercised fair amount of restrain, some may find wording above harsh and/or biased, give it some thought though. I will not hide my dissatisfaction with the terminology that's used in mainstream media. It skews perception, fraud is a fraud and crime is a crime. We should call it what it is… some of the crimes that were committed are without precedent, to say that [libor rigging](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/perfi/credit/story/2012-07-18/libor-interest-rate-scandal/56322230/1) constitutes a ''fraud against humanity'' isn't overstatement at all.

Self-determination can exist both internally and externally.
Scotland for example fulfills the criteria for self-determination on the internal level of the UK due to the fact that they elect MP's.

I'm not sure of the claims of the two individuals.

My view on the topic would be to agree with him that citizens cannot effectively vote on federalization for the reasons you mentioned above. As an example, the EU Constitution was passed in every national parliament, and the only reason it wasn't adopted was referendums.

I think this should be a matter that be deal with by national parliaments within each member states, in a very serious way in each country. Everything should be done properly, debate in each country, explained to people,etc.
However,the vote for this should be done in Parliament.

You should always demand a written contract from your employer because without this it makes it harder for you to prove various things like how much pay was arranged, or how much holidays you where promised etc.

But generally, that what was arranged between you and your employer is what is relevant at first, no matter if it is written down or not. If certain things weren't arranged the law is in effect about those things.

Your question about how much notice of quitting you have to give is regulated in § 622 Paragraph 1 BGB. 
&gt;(1) Das Arbeitsverhältnis eines Arbeiters oder eines Angestellten (Arbeitnehmers) kann mit einer Frist von vier Wochen zum Fünfzehnten oder zum Ende eines Kalendermonats gekündigt werden.

So /u/pfdwxenon is kinda wrong about this, because he quoted Paragraph 2. 

Paragraph 1 of § 622 BGB says you have to give your employer a 4 weeks notice, either to the 15th of a Month or to the last day of the Month. So you can either quit on a 15th of a month or on the last day of a month and have to notify your employer 4 weeks before that. The notice has to arrive one day before the 4 week period. Say you wanted to quit on 31 of December you have to notify your employer 4 weeks + 1 day before that, that would be the 2nd of December.

That's the [just world fallacy](http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/iie/v3n2/justworld.html), which is the false belief that people get what they ""deserve,"" whether due to God or market forces or some other cause.

Excerpt:

""If the belief in a just world simply resulted in humans feeling more comfortable with the universe and its capriciousness, it would not be a matter of great concern for ethicists or social scientists. But Lerner's Just World Hypothesis, if correct, has significant social implications. The belief in a just world may undermine a commitment to justice.

Zick Rubin of Harvard University and Letitia Anne Peplau of UCLA have conducted surveys to examine the characteristics of people with strong beliefs in a just world. They found that people who have a strong tendency to believe in a just world also tend to be more religious, more authoritarian, more conservative, more likely to admire political leaders and existing social institutions, and more likely to have negative attitudes toward underprivileged groups. To a lesser but still significant degree, the believers in a just world tend to 'feel less of a need to engage in activities to change society or to alleviate plight of social victims.'

Ironically, then, the belief in a just world may take the place of a genuine commitment to justice. For some people, it is simply easier to assume that forces beyond their control mete out justice. When that occurs, the result may be the abdication of personal responsibility, acquiescence in the face of suffering and misfortune, and indifference towards injustice.""",0,1385273306,null,0,1385273659,0,cdlouaj,t3_1rbq8f,t1_cdlouaj,t1_cdlosoh,null,1428530898,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Social norms that define some behavior as ""fair"" exist in human societies, and that's what matters when discussion human behavior.

The idea of fairness also appears to exist in our close relatives:

[Monkeys show a sense of fairness regarding payment for work](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/09/0917_030917_monkeyfairness.html)

&gt;why should we reward those that do not contribute

People who receive a minimum wage are by definition contributing; why else would they receive a wage?

&gt;why should we penalize those to succeed?

That's the just world fallacy again.  You're assuming that the people who make these massive salaries deserve them, have a right to receive them and it is a punishment to deny them that right.  There is no such right.  These things are social conventions, and a society can validly choose to encourage egalitarianism by limiting the pay of CEOs (for example) relative to their lowest-paid employees.

When a society is not egalitarian, it is hard for it to function as a democracy.  It is hard for low-income people and their children to achieve their potential, which hurts economic growth (a society of millions of serfs and a few hundred aristocrats would not be as productive as a society with a broad middle class and no aristocrats, for example).  It creates suffering.  There is no reason why society must alleviate those problems, but it is valid for people to try.

&gt;One of the consequences of such notions as ‘entitlements’ is that people who have contributed nothing to society feel that society owes them something, apparently just for being nice enough to grace us with their presence.

I'm not arguing that people who refuse to contribute should get any specific benefits.

Mais c'est des blancs dans ta tête, donc c'est des bons. Les différences culturelles importent peu dans cette logique après tout.

Make sure to know some of the company history, some recent news about them, the areas the are active in (including ones that not everybody might know about, e.g. fancy lights for car tuning), things you were impressed by or what you read and liked about them (innovative products, sustainability, supporting the arts, etc.) There's a lot of good information on the website about that. 

Having some good reasons queued up why you want to work for them and not e.g. Philips or in a different industry won't hurt either.

Also don't worry too much about language - just try to be calm and collect your thoughts before you speak and take your time for the answers.

The two of best one, in my opinion, to compare against one another is this one made by World Bank, and another one made by World Economic Forum.

World bank shows the direction in which the country is developing not necessarily the immediate ""ease of doing business today"", whilst World Economic Forum's map shows how it is there today. These maps are only to be interpreted that way, if they are to be compared to one another.

Example:

Georgia in WB map is ranked 8th (very highly) but on the WEF one they are 72th. This means the situation there changed dramatically to the better in the last year or so, but they still aren't the best place to ""Do business"". They accomplished this by firing most the of bureaucrats, who's only purpose was to stop people from doing business. Any country in Europe could do that if they suddenly wanted their economies to grow, and are willing to go past crying of the people who will get fired spend 8 hours a day checking facebook and getting paid for it.

edit: I saw that OP has Lithuanian flare, so I'll speak about situation here too.

Lithuania is ranked 17 because of the legalisation of limited responsibility and no capital requiring Juridical units. Some other things improved a bit, but not by much. Speaking of this particular case, this will not be valid by the next year, because you will need to pay the taxes you weren't suppose to pay for these kinds of businesses by the next year.

Also few viable things to fix, to improve Lithuania's standing in this chart by another 10 places.

1. Energy supply. Ranked 75th. To get electricity to my new factory I would need to wait *at least* 4 months, usually it is more like 6. I can build a fully working factory faster.

2. Business protection. Ranked 68th. The laws here protect the company from it's own stockholders or owners. It is possible (and legal) to steal a business from someone else, who are not familiar with this problem. One good thing it isn't common knowledge yet. 

There is also taxes, which are collected at a loss of money (you spend more money collecting, than you receive). There is also a problem with permits for construction, which can be helped by slashing down the bureaucrats. There of course are a few more, but it is difficult to remember them all immediately.",0,1385281426,null,0,1385282934,0,cdlqqw8,t3_1raewk,t1_cdlqqw8,t3_1raewk,null,1428530009,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Well, others covered some points, so I'm going to tell you why Romania wants Ukraine on the EU-side.

1. Ukraine is Romania's northern and eastern (partially) neighbour. As such, it wants a friendly and democratic as possible Ukraine on its border. Having a Russian ally on our back is something we do not want.

2. Moldova is between Ukraine and Romania. Moldova was once part of Romania, and the only way any unification can happen is inside the EU. Even if unification does not happen, we still want Moldova as close to us as possible. We think it's both best for us and best for them. Having pro-European states on both borders will make a Moldova less likely to slip back into the pro-Russia camp, as it would be in an ""exclave""-type situation.

3. Same as the above, but for the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria. Ukraine in the EU-side would isolate Transnistria from Russia, and as such will weaken the Russian position there (economically). This might hasten a solution to the conflict in a Moldova-favorable way (reintegration) rather than the opposite (status-quo or secession)",0,1385284130,null,0,false,0,cdlr7g6,t3_1ra0ht,t1_cdlr7g6,t1_cdl3mtu,null,1428529795,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Gab es da russische Abstimmungen? Das Bild bei unseren Lehrern war immer ""G8 ist der größte Rotz"". Es heißt ja nicht nur mehr Druck für den Schüler, sondern auch um einiges mehr Arbeit für den Lehrer.

Fakt ist: der Schüler wird durch die Schule nicht schlauer, er wird blöd gehalten. Ein Relikt aus Bismarcks Schmiede, welches den Arbeiter so formen sollte, dass er nichts hinterfragt und alles hinnimmt. 

#G8 macht es nur noch extremer.

Die Wahlmöglichkeiten im G8, also keine, da man sowieso jeden Kurs einbringen muss, führen auch dazu, das Schülersprecher auf Konferenzen für eine Sache stimmen (gegen die Schüler, was zum fick), mit dem Argument ""eh nichts dagegen tun zu können"".

Ich finde ja den Begriff 'Armut' unpassend und für falsches Gejammere. Mein Beispiel sollte das ""Gefühl des Abgehängtseins"" beschreiben, des nicht-mehr-teilhabens, das ich für wichtig bei Depressionen aufgrund von äusseren Umständen halte (es gibt ja auch andere Depressionen).

Den heutigen Harzt4-Empfängern geht es ja materiell besser als einem Fabrikarbeiter vor einigen Jahrzehnten (Zentralheizung vs. Ofenheizung, WC vs. Etagenklo, zumindest auf dem Land ein altes Auto vs. Moped, etc. etc.). Vielleicht gibt es deshalb auch weniger ""Revolutionswillen""....ich konnte mal von meinem Büro aus die Montagsdemos gegen Hartz4 vor dem Roten Rathaus in Berlin beobachten, wie es jede Woche weniger Leute wurden.

Was aber für mich da ist, ist das Gefühl einer Abkoppelung, auch weil die Aufstiegsperspektive für die da unten immer kleiner wird.

true,Britzer,BERL,Berlin,"Was soll eine Strafe eigentlich erreichen? 

Es hat sich nämlich gezeigt, dass die Verbrechensrate unabhängig von der höhe der Strafen in einem jeweiligen Land ist. D.h. in Ländern wo es nur offenen Vollzug gibt (Grönland), weil man dort keine Gefängnisse kennt, auch nicht für Mord, ist die Kriminalitätsrate auch nicht höher, werden also auch nicht mehr Morde verübt, als in Ländern wie Russland oder den USA, wo man schon für relativ geringe Vergehen sehr lange in Gefängnisse kommt. Oder wo dort die Bedingungen sehr schlecht sind.

Das Justizsystem ist hauptsächlich Ausdruck dessen, was die Gesellschaft möchte und hat wenig mit Wirksamkeit gegen Straftaten zu tun. In Deutschland haben wir ein ziemlich ausgefeiltes System bei dem die individuelle Schuld beleuchtet wird. Ich saß mal in einer Jura-Vorlesung. Das wird sehr philosophisch. Und trotz unser tollen Philosophie und unserer Schuld-Gedanken hat auch unser System keinen nennenswerten Einfluss auf die Kriminalität. 

Aber es kostet Geld Leute wegzusperren. Es kostet erheblich weniger Geld ihnen den Führerschein wegzunehmen. Und wenn sie das als Strafe empfinden, umso besser. Und vielleicht bewirkt die erzwungene Änderung im Mobilitätsverhalten der Kriminellen mehr als mit anderen Kriminellen in einen Knast gesperrt zu werden. Vielleicht auch nicht. Ich bezweifle jedoch stark, dass es weniger bringt. Weil wir ja wissen, dass Gefängnisse gar keinen Effekt haben. Siehe oben.

Aber mit einem hat der ADFC recht: Da es bei Bestrafung von Kriminellen mehr um gesellschaftliche Wünsche und Wahrnehmung geht als um Kriminalitätsbekämpfung ist es natürlich für überzeugte Fahrradfahrer ein ziemlicher Rückschlag, wenn die Gesellschaft ihre Art der Mobilität als Strafe empfindet.

- Both extreme wings in Danish politics did very well. The Danish People's Party (DF) got their first mayor. The Red-Green alliance (Enhedslisten) had an extremely good election in the two biggest cities Copenhagen and Århus, taking most of their seats from the still-left-wing-but-not-so-left-wing Socialist's people's party (SF).

- The four biggest cities Copenhagen, Århus, Odense and Ålborg still have Social Democratic mayors.

- After a incredibly misleading and poorly-made exit-poll made by Epenion for national public TV, DR, which painted a gloomy picture for the Social Democrats, a debate has started about whether to ban exit-polls. DR has since vowed to stop using exit polls. [Source](http://cphpost.dk/national/dr-drops-exit-polls-following-criticism).

British Gibraltar keeps coming up too. 

Why do all the papers have a daily circulation? Surely it would be better just to have one addition per week which covers all the important news rather than a different one everyday which covers a bunch of pointless stuff. I thought that's what the Weekend additions would do, but no. they just fill that with a lot of commentaries by high profile figures and travel magazines and TV magazines.

* The protest block of immigrants and left extremists is active once again. One year after a group of asylum seekers and pro-immigration-activists had occupied a park and later a church in Vienna, a demonstration in front of the quarters for asylum seekers in Traiskirchen has taken place.

* The Vienna bus line 13A has been given a new route, after the Mariahilfer Straße has been turned into a partial pedestrian area. Originally, the bus was supposed to drive a short bit through the pedestrian area. For some reason, the union of the bus drivers started complaining and the communal public traffic operator decided to try another route. This route would have lead through a street where they would have had to abandon 10 parking spaces to allow the bus to pass in both directions. After storeowners started to complain, they moved the route to some narrow streets, where 20 retired persons have held 3 demonstrations last week, because there has not been a bus passing there before and that could not be changed.

Due correzioni a costo di sembrarti saccente.
""non ho mai lasciare l'autralia"", evidentemente l'inglese ti porta a dire ""i've never left australia"", a short and concise phrase which you translated literally. the correct version should however be ""non ho mai lasciato l'australia"", because lasciato is participio passato, cioè significa che tu questa cosa qua non l'hai mai fatta: if i said ""lasciare l'australia"" it would have meant ""to leave australia"". Sembra il titolo di un film.
""Lasciare"" is infinito presente, this gives the idea of an ongoing action which protracts itself through time. Lasciato is something that happened in the past, and whose effects still retain in the present. Immagina che in italiano è come se si dicesse sempre ""i had never left australia"": this phrase, translated literally, could be correct: dice infatti ""non ho mai lasciato l'australia"".

When you write ""per quanto riguarda la germania, il paese sia tranquillo.."" you miss ""che"": in italiano, è meglio abbondare con le parole invece che usarne di meno. ""Per quanto riguarda la germania, [PENSO] che il paese..."" because you still think that. It is obvious that your error comes from something like ""regarding germany, the country is calm..."". L'inglese fa economia di parole, l'italiano mai.

Congratulations sul tuo uso dei congiuntivi comunque, c'è gente qui in italia che li usa meno bene di te. Un po' come a volte su reddit si legge di gente che confonde ""your"" ""you're"" e ""yours"" - those who study another language often know more about its particularities and exeptions degli abitanti locali, che imparano la lingua ""attraverso il latte materno"", come usava dire la mia prof. di italiano.

""In"" referred to months is not used in Italian. I'd suggest you to use ""a"", that's because you don't answer to the question  ""where"", regarding to months, which are not places, but to the question ""at what time"", ecco perchè usi ""a"": perchè indica il tempo. Non chiedi ""in che ora ci vediamo"", ma ""a che ora ci vediamo"".

Spero che questo miscuglio linguistico non ti sia dispiaciuto. Sento già Umberto Eco e la sua poliglotta cultura che si rivoltano nella tomba.

However, he's witnessed a few eruptions before and the worst part is the dust. It damages infrastructures (e.g. it can stack very high on the roofs and damages the gutters unless removed immediately), the crops (try getting it off from the cracks in a cauliflower...), and just a pain in the ass to deal with in general.     
You could feel the dust cracking under your teeth as soon as you removed your surgical mask and tried to speak; or other inconveniences like having to drive looking out of the car window relying on the occasional guy with a hose by the side of the street to clean his windshield (there's only so much wipers can do against dust when you run out of water).

The town itself is pretty interesting exactly because of its proximity to the volcano, though.

true,headbox,null,null,"&gt; Non trovi che, in un certo senso, benché il punto centrale della storia siano i libri, il vero oggetto della storia siano in realtà le idee, di cui i libri sono soltanto un veicolo?

Si sicuramente è cosi, ho letto il commento di risposta che ti sei dato e ovviamente non si può non riconoscere a Bradbury una straordinaria capacità di percezione relativa all'essenza delle cose, il senso espresso nei libri lo si può trovare in altre forme espressive come quelle musicali, quelle filmiche e nei rapporti interpersonali: nella vita insomma.
In ogni caso ovviamente queste idee devono passare dal giudizio dei singoli attraverso l'interpretazione della ragione e dell'esperienza, per questo il ruolo degli uomini è fondamentale, un libro non ha esistenza propria così come uno spartito non può suonarsi da solo, la musica delle idee dovrà comporsi quindi in configurazioni ""educate"" nel senso opposto a ""condizionate""*.

&gt;Secondo te, quale dei tre mondi descritti in questi romanzi è il più plausibile? Quale è più simile a una realtà che potrebbe (o sarebbe potuta) avverarsi?

Secondo me il mondo attuale è molto distante da quello orwelliano e più vicino a quello di Huxley e Farheneit, giusto per sparare dei numeri per gioco direi 10% Orwell, 45% Huxley e 45% Bradbury.

Di seguito lascio alcune considerazioni sparse:

Ciò che non è discutibile è assioma, quindi dittatura, imposizione, in Huxley le idee sono imposte nel sonno, ovvero nel momento di minima difesa, si devono stampare nel cervello, oltre il vaglio della ragione.
*Da wikipedia: ""Il condizionamento viene considerato una pratica normale in questa società, tanto che gli individui usano il termine ""condizionato"" al posto di ""educato"".

In Huxley la solitudine deve essere evitata quasi per legge (anche dal punto di vista sessuale infatti è incoraggiata e promossa la totale libertà) è nella solitudine quindi che il seme del dubbio prende forma, in Orwell sarà l'amore a far scattare il meccanismo del dubbio mentre in Bradbury sarà il senso di solitudine derivato dal rapporto inesistente con la moglie e la sensazione stringente di commettere un'ingiustizia.

In Bradbury c'è il seme stesso della rivoluzione, si capisce che per gli incendiari è prassi rimanere soli con alcuni libri e non viene fatto niente per impedirlo (anzi è considerato quasi un passaggio necessario) rischio altissimo e c'è un senso generale di colpa in chi commette il male di bruciare, Montag quando uccide Beatty riconosce in quest'ultimo la ricerca della morte non opponendo resistenza, Beatty voleva morire, riconosce la totale giustezza della sua punizione.

La moglie di Montag si droga di nascosto al fine di annullarsi consapevolmente, piena di colpa per quel gesto che soffoca il dubbio e il contro agire. In Huxley la droga non è droga ma parte della vita stessa, non drogarsi nel mondo di Huxley è sottrazione e mancanza, un venire meno. Montag al contrario si preoccupa della moglie che si droga perchè sa che è sbagliato, l'universo di Bradbury condivide quindi almeno in parte alcuni nostri valori.

In Huxley la guerra viene raccontata per descrivere un passato barbarico dal quale la nuova società deve distaccarsi il più possibile, in 1984 la guerra è perenne, è mantenimento e industria, in Bradbury è istantanea, finale prima della rinascita ed è risoluzione. 
Il tema della guerra rappresenta quindi rispettivamente il passato lontano, l'oppressione del presente e un futuro necessario.

Il controllo totalitario in 1984 è messo davanti all'uomo, imponente, insormontabile, l'uomo si sente una nullità nei confronti di questo potere e non agisce per paura e paura del fallimento, cosa che in effetti poi accadrà anche al protagonista. In Huxley il controllo è inserito dentro l'uomo, gli viene detto che ha tutto quindi non è necessario che si muova in alcuna direzione, l'uomo non agisce perchè non conosce il termine della parola azione, che ormai è desaturata di senso e confusa col tutto codificato in strettissimi contenitori (partendo dalle caste). In Bradbury esiste il tema del controllo passivo e del controllo attivo ma secondo me appare tutto molto meno soffocante che negli altri due universi.

Sia in 1984 che in F451 si riconosce la potenza assoluta del linguaggio. Controllare il linguaggio significa controllare le idee che esprime e con queste manipolare gli uomini. Nel caso di Orwell il linguaggio viene deformato e le idee rovesciate di senso (""La pace è guerra"", ""La libertà è schiavitù"", ""L'ignoranza è forza""), in Bradbury il linguaggio è nascosto, cancellato, si bruciano i libri. Huxley risolve il problema alla radice non munendo le persone della capacità di analizzare alcun tipo di linguaggio, eugenetica. Perlomeno in 1984 e in F451 l'uomo nasce uomo, in Huxley si lavora affinchè nasca qualcosa di diverso da un uomo.

I suspect it's quite likely that that other bodies could have some kind of short-term arrangement to simplify the transition.

But in the short term it could simply agree to pay £X for the next 5 years and lease that service from rUK.

- **Manhunt after the attacks at BFMTV, Libération and Société Générale**: On friday morning a man entered the parisian office of the 24hour news TV channel BFM but didn't shoot (tried to but failed or only wanted to scare people, it's still not clear: 2 bullets rolled on the floor and he allegedly said ""Next time I won't miss""). On monday morning he entered the headquarters of the (left-wing) newspaper Libération and shot a 23 year-old photographer, who was critically hurt. The man then went to La Défense and fired up three times (in the air) outside the headquarters of the bank la Société Générale before forcing a man to drive him to Les Champs Elysées where the police lost his trace on monday around noon. Since then, thousands of policemen  protected strategic places in Paris and searched for him. Gradually it became clear that the 3 cases were related and the images of the suspect (taken from the surveillance cameras) were released. DNA tests from samples taken at the various sites of the attacks confirmed it was the same and only man but didn't match with any of the DNAs on the database of previously convicted/suspected people (This file was created in 2002). The hunt stopped wednesday evening when the guy was found in a car park in a semi-conscious state (he attempted suicide?) thanks to a witness statement from a man who housed him not long ago. The suspect's name is Abdelhakim Dekhar and he was convicted to 4 years of jail for his role in the 1994 Rey-Maupin case: shootings in Paris that killed 4 people and for which Dekhar bought the gun (and maybe was the leader: I've heard people with different opinions on this previous case.) Dekhar left ""rambling conspiracy letters"" denouncing capitalism, accusing  journalists ""of being paid to feed lies to citizens"". He also wrote about ""a plot aimed at the return of fascism in the media, in banks, in the policy on suburbs"" and decried what he saw as the ""dehumanisation"" of people living in the suburbs. One letter also mentioned Libya, Syria and the situation in the Arab world. After being released from jail in the late 90s he apparently moved to the UK and came back to france in July. Since being arrested this week, he has been brought to the hospital and is apparently on a hunger strike now.

- **The  ex-hostage who escaped from Nigeria last weekend comes back to France and tells his story** (This got minor coverage because all the attention was on manhunt): Francis Collomb, the 63 year-old engineer who had been kidnapped nearly a year ago, explained how he prepared his escape. He observed his captors' praying times and managed to flee, walked 5 kms before finding a moto taxi and going to a police station... no ransom paid this time.

No. My objection was to point out the poor reasoning which I named. I also pointed out the irony that your objection and Goebbels' rhetorics had a commonality. But that is inconsequential to the point: the use of poor reasoning.

The reasonable objection would have been for example pointing out that things really aren't that black and white, and that in reality there exists a wider pool of reasonable options than the propagandist dichotomy of dead||red. 

It indeed is a silly and oversimplified catchphrase, but merely believing it was coined by Goebbels himself is not a very good objection to it - nor does it give much context as the phrase has been used extensively during the cold war by many in many contexts and as different versions.

&gt; A shot of the crowd at European Square for today's pro-European rally that started at 1 p.m. today. Opposition politicians estimate the crowd at **100,000** people, but journalists on the scene put the number at closer to **50,000** people.

Lets put the number at 75 000. Now, in order to find out the magnitude of this demonstration we need to see this figure relative to the city's population.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_metropolitan_area

&gt; Total population: census and estimates numbers vary from **3.275.000** to **3,648,900**.

Let's be generous and put it to 3.3 million. So how much is 75 000 of 3.3 million? Approximately 2.3%. That's not including passerbys curious to see what's going on.

In other words, one can conclude Ukranians do not want this as much as they claimed to in various opinion polls. An amount of Kievs population akin to that of a typical neighbourhood has gathered in the main square. This must be the non-happening of the year.

You as a consumer can actually choose where you want to get your electricity from, for example if you prefer nuclear you can get it from there, if you prefer cheap and dirty there's a coal plant etc. The price is based on the source, not the grid, which is the same for all.

What I don't like about the Hungarian solution is that they want to make everything state-owned: power, water, garbage, roads. I don't think state-owned companies provide the best services, the people who get jobs there are the ones who couldn't find a job in the private sector. And once they are employed their employment becomes a political issue since they're paid by the current government, so if they get fired, the governing party will lose votes... and so they have less chance of getting fired than in private-owned companies, meaning they don't have to work as hard.",0,1385307948,null,0,false,0,cdlv81x,t3_1r7h4i,t1_cdlv81x,t1_cdlupf1,null,1428527865,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;Russia and the EU becoming friends will take MANY decades

Seriously though, Russia's per capita GDP (PPP, of course) is three times that of Ukraine and by a margin of 10 thousands USD larger than that of Belarus (and, before you think of it, oil&amp;gas are only 12%, it trickles down to the rest of economy of course, but it's nothing like Saudi Arabia). With per capita GDP this big, you shouldn't normally have authoritarian rule of any sort, let alone footsies with the social right, which only began after the protests of 2011, before that Russia was homophobic only in a sense that most of its population wasn't particularly friendly to gays, [which is true just the same for the rest of Eastern Europe (page 32)](http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/397-FRA_hdgso_report_part2_en.pdf), and conservative in no sense whatsoever (6% of churchgoing population, it's Scandinavian level apathy towards religion).

All in all, I'm not sure how much time becoming friends with EU will take or will it ever happen, because big sector of EU will resist it (just like they resist lifting visa requirements for Russians, which is no longer economically justified), but this is not a prerequisite to become attractive to Belarussians and Ukrainians as an alternative to EU.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"It basically seems to mirror the NAFTA provisions for Americans and Mexicans, for the most part. /u/flusterer's link down below is a good one. Also, what he said about it taking time to get full freedom of movement on the back of a trade deal is true - my guess is that if Canadians ever were invited into the freedom of movement thing (which I think would be a great opportunity for the EU), it would take *at least* 10 years from now. Probably more like 15-20. It could potentially go faster, and I don't think it will take as long as 30 years largely due to the fact that the world has changed, populations have grown and industry has globalised so much moreso than when the Schengen Agreement was signed.

In summary, it looks like there will be easier entry requirements for businesspeople and 'professionals'. The professionals bit is the single most interesting thing to me. Under NAFTA, Americans and Mexican professionals can obtain a Canadian work permit with only a valid job offer; there's no need to get something called a 'labour market opinion'. Most countries have some variation of the LMO, where a particular government agency has to sign off on the fact that the immigrant meets the educational and work experience requirements for that position that no other local does (in the EU, 'local' refers not only to nationals of that particular country, but **all** EU citizens). So Americans and Mexicans in Canada who have a degree and a certain amount of work experience (typically at least 12 months) in a profession listed as 'professional' in the annex to NAFTA can enter Canada and obtain a work permit at the airport/border crossing with only a signed contract in hand. No long and complex LMO needed. It seems like the EU-Canada deal will have a very similar provision, meaning that Europeans will get the same rights as North Americans when entering Canada, and Canadians will in turn be able to bypass the 'labour market test' or 'worker authorisation' or whatever that country calls it. It's a pretty big deal, although nothing as cool as the EU's freedom of movement, because we don't yet know what the definition and constraints on the term 'professionals' will be, and you'll still need to have some form of employer sponsorship in countries with a sponsorship register (such as the UK, for example). There are also provisions in the EU-Canada deal for intra-company transferees to have easier access to Europe, but to be honest most of those conditions seem to be present in the immigration systems of European countries that I'm familiar with. I think that particular point is mainly aimed at Canada opening up their visa system to European intra-company transferees headed to Canada, and not vice-versa. 

It also remains to be seen whether or not this particular provision will even be brought up in the EU-US trade deal currently being hashed out - it doesn't seem quite as likely to me to see something like that go through, mainly because of the unwillingness of the US State Department to go for these types of simplified immigration procedures, as evidenced by the US's lack of participation in the APEC business card programme and almost all youth working holiday agreements, as well as the high barriers to entry for the Visa Waiver Program.

The SNP got a majority because they give free shit to the Scots. I don't know the details of the matter financially, but Scots get a better deal than I do. Be that because of North Sea Oil (which is going to run out in a decade or 2 anyway) or bribes from Westminster, I know not. 

The SNP can afford to do that now. Without the supporting framework they operate in, it might change. There's some massive blackholes in their spending plans, and the issue of using the £ in a hypothetical Scotland is sticky. If the Scots default on their share of the national debts and join the Euro, for instance, they would not be able to borrow money or really do much with such an awful credit rating. If they join the pound, they avoid that mess but have no control on monetary policy.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Even if I presume that 50% want to join the EU, it means that the other 50% doesn't. 

It's not black or white as there are also 'hard to say' answers. What the 50% does mean is that majority supports joining the EU over Russia's union.

&gt; I would be interested to see graphs from regions like Crimea, where 80% of population is Russian. As opposed to southern and eastern regions with more balanced population.

Sure, grab the goalposts and run with them. Your argument rested upon your following belief: ""The main reason for this is Ukraine being divided into a pro-West part in the West, and pro-Russian part in the South and East, that has 17 million native Russian speakers."" You even stated it as your ""*main reason*"". 

Joining the EU has majority support even in the areas you claimed would be the ""main reason"" that Ukraine will never be under EU influnce. And now that you've been shown that this not the case you have shrunk it into Crimea. Goalposts, who needs them anyway.

&gt; Don't forget that the question in the polls is EU membership, not what they were about to sign. The fact that 37% people think that Ukraine can become a full member after 5 years just shows how uninformed they are. 

Riight, people just don't know what they're talking about when they support the EU over Russia's union. That must be it. Misinformed. If only they were better informed, then they would support union with Russia and you'd be correct in your claim. 

But the fact is that majority doesn't and your claim is incorrect, which is a bit unfortunate for your argument as it was the ""*main reason*"".

&gt; If both EU and Ukrainian specialists made analysis and showed what's going to happen to Ukraine in the short term without financial aid (as well as from having bad relations with Russia), people would be against this AA and trade treaty with EU. 

From moving goalposts to fantasies. What you're doing now is fantasizing about imaginary future where your argument would hold true. Imaginary arguments are not arguments at all. Neither is setting imaginary conditions. 

&gt; Again, the EU is not seriously considering Ukraine's membership right now. 

Ukraine has not applied for a membership so there's nothing to ""seriously consider"". Currently Ukraine is a Eastern Partnership country. However, future membership is a possibility and has been since at least the Mamaia summit.

&gt; So such polls are useless.

They're indeed useful as they do measure Ukrainans' attitudes towards the future regarding the EU.
