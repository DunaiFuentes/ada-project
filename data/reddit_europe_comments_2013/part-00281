Presents are given in some families but the whole children's fairy tale thing is for Sinterklaas (St. Nicholas) Eve on December 5th. Santa Claus is often seen as a cheap, Americanized imitation of Sinterklaas and more of a decor thing rather than a true tradition. While Sinterklaas is originally a religious thing, it has mostly been secularized, just like Christmas. Some people give presents on both holidays, some on either Sinterklaas or Christmas.

Some traditional Christmas Songs differ depending on which school you attend. If your parents sent you to a religious school the song ""Kling Klokje"" has the sentence ""Jezus is gekomen"" (Jesus has come). If you go to a secular school on the other hand, the song might be secularized into ""Kerstmis is gekomen"" (Christmas has come).",0,1388003938,null,0,false,0,cea1dxn,t3_1to7xo,t1_cea1dxn,t3_1to7xo,null,1427988593,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,zipponap,null,null,"Che sono oggettivamente delle multinazionali che lucrano su quanti si professano ambientalisti in modo acritico. Il discorso è lungo, ma riducendolo ai minimi termini:

-Conservazionismo: Spendono quantitativi galattici di risorse per salvare specie animali che, lasciate a sè e senza che gli uomini gli diano particolare importanza, si sarebbero già estinte senza che nessuno batta ciglio. Non fraintendermi, credo nella biodiversità come valore assoluto, credo che l'uomo sia colpevole dell'estinzione di molte specie, e credo che per quanto possibile sie nostra responsabilità far si che altre specie non si estinguano. Ma nella storia del mondo miliardi di specie sono venute ed andate e tentare di preservare la biosfera corrente come se fosse un testo sacro mi sembra stupido. Non voglio vederla -impoverirsi-, ma non voglio neanche disneyzzare la natura e vederla assomigliare sempre di più a quanto noi uomini vorremmo vederci.

-OGM. Se hai la benchè minima formazione scientifica allora sai che non c'è nessun motivo per andare contro agli OGM, semmai il contrario. Se fai una minimale analisi economica vedrai come tutto il circo vegano-bio-ambientalista si basa su idee pretestuose, ideologiche ed in ultima analisi sbagliate. Poi possiamo discutere se ci piace o meno il modello della multinazionale, ma questo è un altro discorso.

-Ricerca: Greenpeace si oppone e fa lobbying attivo contro la possibilità di brevettare i risultati di determinati tipi di ricerca medica, tipo quella genomica. Che piaccia o meno nessuno puà permettersi di investire miliardi di dollari (non milioni, miliardi) per fare ricerca su come curare determinate malattie senza avere un sistema che lo tuteli e gli garantisca un ritorno economico. Ovviamente sono contrario alla brevettabilità di patrimoni genetici comuni ad altri esseri umani, ma se si parla di trattamenti, allora sorry, tra salvare un bambino lasciando che la multinazionale di turno faccia molti soldi, e vederlo morire per assenza di una cura, io scelgo la prima.

-Collusione con nazianimalismo: Greenpeace, WWF, etc. etc. sono +- visibilmente colluse con i vari movimenti quali peta ed alf, che sono a loro volta movimenti fattualmente terroristici verso la ricerca scientifica. Quando vedi la brambilla di FI spingere per fare leggi che impediscono fattualmente la sperimentazione animale in Italia, io vedo solo dei vigliacchi che raccolgono voti e risorse economiche avvalendosi di relitti umani che non sono in grado di avere rapporti con i propri pari e devono quindi rivolgersi esclusivamente al gattino o cagnolino di turno. E tutto questo a scapito di chi necessita veramente di quella ricerca scientifica.

Sono stato un sostenitore attivo di Greenpeace per due anni, 140€ all'anno. L'ho fatto perchè, pur non avendo particolare simpatia verso determinati animalisti, ho sempre ritenuto che fosse necessaria l'esistenza di entità che si ponessero a freno di derive antiambientaliste. Ma in due anni non hanno fatto altro che continuare, insistentemente, a chiedermi soldi, oltre agli 11€ mensili che già gli davo. E nel frattempo vedevo quei soldi venir usati per srotolare striscioni in piazza san marco per protesta contro il mondo della moda (sic). O venir usati per far lobbying contro la brevettabilità della ricerga genetica e staminale. O per far guerra agli OGM o contro la sperimentazione animale. O, in ultima analisi, per andare ad assaltare navi petroliere o baleniere, come se questo cambiasse realmente qualcosa e non fosse invece solo un gigantesco stunt pubblicitario. Sinceramente, ho posti migliori dove andare a dare i miei 150€ annuali.

I'm personally very disappointed with the way the trade with the commonwealth was carried out in terms of the EU. We did our closest partners and allies over because of the French not wanting cheaper dairy on the market. 

Even my economics summer project gave me enough reading material to thoroughly put me off the institution. It just makes utterly no sense, with the assumption that a one-size-fits-all solution is findable and that we can trust the technocrats to do it all for us with not much in the way of oversight. At least in the British Civil Service, there's a degree of accountability.   

I can't object to close ties to the US. Same language and similar culture, even if they perhaps aren't as civilised as Australia or Canada yet. There is a middle-ground between superpower and irrelevant semi-protectorate. 

I guess Germany stands to gain the most from full union.

Like when we originally joined the ECC we had to turn our backs on countries like New Zealand because of the CAP. New Zealand is a pretty small place and at the time was sending 60% of its exports to Britain, mainly agriculture (cheese, butter,lamb etc). Their market access to Britain was closed off once we joined the ECC and CAP. The impact on New Zealand was severe and they had to go through some rough decades of trade and export diversification.

I understand where you are coming from but you missed out an important part. France, Spain etc have deep cultural and linguistic ties with those nations, but that is not the same as the ties I was discussing. I was discussing sovereign and institutional ties. Those links are much deeper than cultural or linguistic, especially when discussing relations between countries.

 When you share the same head of state and have deep connections with another nation through many institutions (military, intelligence, foreign office etc) and levels of government, that is a level of closeness that is in another ballpark altogether. This is not the same as Spain's relationships for example with Mexico, or Portugals with Brazil or France with Algeria. The relationship between the commonwealth realms is almost akin to a personal union. 

Add to the fact that these nations are developed first world nations and not part of the developing world. Having those strong ties I discussed with developed countries, that is certainly an area in which we are alone.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;I'm personally very disappointed with the way the trade with the commonwealth was carried out in terms of the EU. We did our closest partners and allies over because of the French not wanting cheaper dairy on the market.

The Commonwealth was never a viable trading bloc. Much of it was too far and too poor to come anywhere close to the importance of trade with Germany and France. It still is. Canada and Australia were, and still are, the only other two Commonwealth members that are close allies of the UK and aren't poor. Despite this, Canada's most important trade relationship has pretty much always been with the US. Australia's most important trade relationship is with China.

Furthermore, France is one of the UK's closest allies. The reason they even have a UNSC seat is because the British insisted, since they couldn't be sure that the US wouldn't become isolationist again. They share nuclear weapons technology, co-develop new technologies, and the French aircraft carrier is patrolling British waters while the UK is without one. They also have far more similar global capabilities than Canada or Australia, and thus are each other's natural partners for intervening in Africa and the Middle East, for example.

&gt;Even my economics summer project gave me enough reading material to thoroughly put me off the institution. It just makes utterly no sense, with the assumption that a one-size-fits-all solution is findable and that we can trust the technocrats to do it all for us with not much in the way of oversight.

The EU isn't made up of any more technocrats than any national government. It has elected officials in the Parliament, heads of government in the European Council, and Cabinet Ministers (who are usually appointed by the heads of government) in the Council of the EU. Furthermore, the idea of a one-size-fits-all Europe no longer exists. A mutli-speed Europe has existed since the late 1980s/early 1990s. Britain and Ireland aren't in Schengen, Britain and Denmark aren't in the Euro, Britain opted out of some social clauses etc.

&gt;At least in the British Civil Service, there's a degree of accountability.

Not any more so than with the European Commission. They're both textbook bureaucracies. It's just that the Commission is accountable to all of the EU, not just Britain.

&gt;I can't object to close ties to the US. Same language and similar culture, even if they perhaps aren't as civilised as Australia or Canada yet. There is a middle-ground between superpower and irrelevant semi-protectorate.

Britain isn't the only EU country with close ties to the US though, just the one with the closest. A further integrated EU is a stronger partner for the US than Britain alone.

&gt;I'm sorry, but people like that old fart Schmidt coming out and writing off our opposition as delusions of grandeur, when it's not, you know, nearly 1000 years of independence and nobody wanting to end that without a fight.

true,johannL,null,null,"&gt; It is not as bad as Orwell's 1984

In ""Nineteen-Eightyfour"" there was a *chance* of a censor watching you. Which was enough, but theoretically, if you did something in front of the telescreen while no party member was actually watching, they were none the wiser, nothing was stored.

The NSA (et. al) on the other hand seek to grab *everything* (not just from a fixed location in your living room, either), and store it *forever* (not really a stretch, storage gets cheaper much faster than humans get chattier, and already educated guesses put the storage time at something around 100 years with current, over-the-counter technology).

So yeah, it's not as bad, because in some ways, it's much worse.

&gt; maybe it does help catch people before they commit a crime

If they haven't committed a crime, what would you catch them for? Also, have you noticed how war profiteers are bailing out bankers and nobody gives a flying fuck, and how the NSA can't actually point to any success in ""fighting terrorism"" with this stuff?

&gt; I'm not doing anything illegal, so I don't mind

That's kind of the problem. What is legal today might be illegal tomorrow. Do you think the Weisse Rose did anything *wrong* by illegally distributing leaflets calling to end the war? Do you think killing millions of people was okay for the Nazis, insofar as they had made it legal?

All you're saying is that you do not intend to tell truth to power, ever, so none of this worries you. This says more about you than about the situation. Yes, disciplined little cogs have nothing to fear, but nobody but disciplined little cogs gives a flying fuck about that. Correctly so.

Can you promise for the next, say, 5000 years, that there will be no totalitarian regime that uses this information for really bad shit? If ""maybe they will catch criminals before they even committed a crime"" is a good enough reason for you, then how come the fact that Hollerith Lochkarten, and census-taking in general, were such a boon to the rounding up efforts of the Nazis, doesn't phase you? More people get killed in the US by their own furniture, not to mention cops, than by terrorism... and there is no indication that any of this is even *used* to combat even that; meanwhile, the amount of money spent on this could save SO. MUCH. MORE. lives than it supposedly saves.

""Random"" question, have you ever heard of COINTELPRO? You sound like you haven't.

And why do you think activism groups are monitored and subverted even today? Because they represent such a huge threat? Cuz terrorism? Or because the real threat is turning on the light in a chicken coop, exposing a fat, lazy fox having a feast? They're gearing up for the backlash people realizing just *how* badly they're being lied to and fucked over, that's pretty much all they're doing. And you're helping, in your own, derpy small way.

true,generalscruff,UKGB,Europhile Euroskeptic,"Perhaps 30 years ago, but now, I think India, Malaysia and South Africa, for example, are going to emerge onto the world stage and Britain already has a 'head start' as opposed to the other European countries. We'd be morons not to exploit those links, and it would be a damn sight easier to do just that if the EU wasn't part of the equation.

I'm a Francophile (something which may surprise you) and I believe that Franco-British connections are crucially important. I also like baguette, strong cheese and wine xD. I would like to see better co-operation between two powerful European countries with fairly similar interests globally speaking. That being said, the CAP is rigged in favour of France and a bit of a clusterfuck as it stands. This can be done without the framework of the EU, which, if time could be turned back, a lot of the worst decisions could be removed and we could remain a 'club' for trading and good relations, rather than everyone being jammed together and bad blood forming as has happened. I'm also in favour of reconciliation with Germany, but that's going to be difficult with them trying to throw their weight around and being the bully-boys of Europe.  

A federal Europe would be one-size-fits-all by definition. The EC isn't exactly accountable in terms of it's finances and the parliament feels like a rump parliament to me. 

In the Civil Service, departments have their political heads who are generally in charge of making sure that the technocrats stay in line, amongst other things. The EU commissioners aren't as directly accountable for the actions of their departments, by the simple virtue of the fact they are appointed rather than elected representatives as our ministers are. Baroness Ashton is in charge of foreign affairs, but who voted for her? She's just a washout from the domestic scene. 

And why should our value as partners to the US determine our foreign policy again? We are close allies, but not some sort of protectorate.

true,LiamtheFilmMajor,null,null,"&gt;Bad/crazy people will always find a way to do their dirty work no matter what. The only way to balance this, is to give people the means to retaliate.

Yes, I get that just making them illegal is not going to eliminate them entirely, but making them legal leads to more guns in the hands of more people, and I for one, don't trust ""people"" to play vigilante IRL.  

&gt;In the other hand, if you add to those odds, the fact you may be shot during the process. Things may not seem so easy or attractive.

I'm not talking about people who casually want to murder because they think they can get away with that. Those are the kind of people who are always going to manage to spread insanity no matter what is illegal. Again, banning guns means that these people cannot just walk into a Walmart and buy a shotgun.

&gt;Anyway, in France, most of the criminals over 18 attacking the L.A.C. are drug dealers; meaning they have to own guns (usually ak-47) to secure their business. So what should we do? Keep prohibiting something that's already in the hands of the wrong people?

I hear this argument all the time, and yes, I suppose criminals, are more likely to get illegal guns, but giving them more reasons to need an automatic weapon is a step in the wrong direction. It's just escalation as opposed to working with actual police to stop dangerous criminals from obtaining or using weapons.

&gt;Does the safety of the L.A.C. worth those 1 minute out of control shooters? I really think it is.

I don't actually know what L.A.C. stands for but here's what I know, the US has an unbelievable amount of school shootings, but it's also got an unbelievable amount of gun deaths that [occur under other circumstances as well.](http://imgur.com/PFgCyuF) Every school shooting means that there are parents who have to outlive their children, and I really have a hard time believing that if the US didn't have approximately one gun for every man, woman, and child; we wouldn't have less gun deaths. It's easy to say that legalizing guns would help curb crime, but the fact is, [in 2009, the state of Alabama (pop. ~4.8 Mil) had just under half the gun deaths that France did (pop ~65 Mil).](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/66/total_number_of_gun_deaths/292,294,194) That's the difference between being able to legally buy an automatic weapon in the US and not being able to in France. I don't want France to legalize guns in the way that the US has because it's a slippery slope towards violence, and more and more studies are saying that the [high rate of ownership doesn't necessarily make things safer.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/18/gun-ownership-gun-deaths-study) ",0,1388011098,null,0,false,0,cea3ml1,t3_1tgamk,t1_cea3ml1,t1_ce9wa5b,null,1427987549,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;Perhaps 30 years ago, but now, I think India, Malaysia and South Africa, for example, are going to emerge onto the world stage and Britain already has a 'head start' as opposed to the other European countries.

India, yes. Malaysia and South Africa are both small and relatively poor countries. Furthermore, they're a great deal farther away from Britain than the rest of the EU. Proximity is the biggest asset to trade. This is the Netherlands has always been a big exporter: they're nestled in between three big, rich countries. It's also why Canada, which is 1/4 the size of China's economy, is still a bigger trade partner with the US. Chances are Germany will still be the UK's biggest or second biggest trade partner by the time either of us die.

&gt;We'd be morons not to exploit those links, and it would be a damn sight easier to do just that if the EU wasn't part of the equation.

The EU has negotiated a lot of FTAs already, and is able to do so on more favorable terms than any individual member state could, because it's collective economic clout is far greater. For example, South Africa is more interested in accessing the EU market than it is in accessing the French market, so the EU has more leverage in the negotiations. The EU is also negotiating a lot more FTAs at the moment, many of which are with Commonwealth countries.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements

http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/international/facilitating-trade/free-trade/#h2-1

Trade policy and negotiations would be much less favorable and more difficult for Britain alone.



&gt;I'm a Francophile (something which may surprise you) and I believe that Franco-British connections are crucially important. I also like baguette, strong cheese and wine xD. I would like to see better co-operation between two powerful European countries with fairly similar interests globally speaking. That being said, the CAP is rigged in favour of France and a bit of a clusterfuck as it stands. This can be done without the framework of the EU, which, if time could be turned back, a lot of the worst decisions could be removed and we could remain a 'club' for trading and good relations, rather than everyone being jammed together and bad blood forming as has happened.

The cap is rigged in favor of France insofar as the French agricultural sector is many times larger than Britain's. Don't forget that while the British complain about CAP subsidies for France, the French complain that the British don't apply more robust regulations on their finance sector (the financial transaction tax, for one).

&gt; I'm also in favour of reconciliation with Germany, but that's going to be difficult with them trying to throw their weight around and being the bully-boys of Europe.

This is just unhelpful rhetoric. Most scholars agree Germany has actually been very reluctant to lead Europe.

&gt;A federal Europe would be one-size-fits-all by definition.

Only at the federal level. The state governments would likely differ greatly, just as they do in the US, for example.

&gt;The EC isn't exactly accountable in terms of it's finances and the parliament feels like a rump parliament to me.

The EC is absolutely accountable. As I said earlier, the Parliament can and has on occasion exerted pressure on it. The EP is, as you suggest, fairly toothless as far as parliaments go, but this is because empowering it would undermine the power of national leaders, who are essentially the only ones who can actually empower it anyway.

&gt;In the Civil Service, departments have their political heads who are generally in charge of making sure that the technocrats stay in line, amongst other things. The EU commissioners aren't as directly accountable for the actions of their departments, by the simple virtue of the fact they are appointed rather than elected representatives as our ministers are. Baroness Ashton is in charge of foreign affairs, but who voted for her? She's just a washout from the domestic scene.

You don't elect someone Foreign Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary, etc. They are given the portfolio. Even so, only a few thousands of people vote for them, so most people don't actually directly vote for the people who end up in the government. Commissioners, while not elected, are also given a portfolio and can be tossed out by the Parliament, which is elected. The Santer Commission was effectively forced into resignation because of pressure from the Parliament, so there is precedent as well.

&gt;And why should our value as partners to the US determine our foreign policy again? We are close allies, but not some sort of protectorate.

Because British PMs have, for the past 70 years, kept close ties with the US as essentially their top priority, largely because of a great overlap of interests. I don't think anyone would argue that the relationship exists on equal footing, however. It's very clear who the senior and junior partners are. The European NATO members, for example, didn't have the logistical support nor the material means to intervene in Libya without the US. It's not often that the UK will intervene somewhere alone, whereas it is common for the US.

&gt;We've not fought off Continental tyrants for centuries to give it all up now. It would be preferable to be a bit weaker and less relevant and retain independence rather than abstract ideas of 'stronk' and subservience as part of some unworkable union.

What value does this have if not to instill nationalist and patriotic sentiment? The EU isn't an empire built on conquest, hellbent on subjugating Britain, like previous attempts at continental unification. It's a project undertaken entirely by the free will of countries. If the UK wants to leave, no one will stop them. I just think it would be a colossal mistake that people who realize in hindsight. Why does it matter if the UK isn't an independent and sovereign nation? You have more in common with the French and the Germans than you don't.

We're all human, but that doesn't mean I can't take some pride in my wider community and believe that we should be self-ruling without being under a federalist framework.

For example, Ireland and Austria's constitutions specifically state that they are neutral countries and cannot engage in any military activities whatsoever. So their inclusion is problematic. Another problem arises out of various Member states' geopolitical interests: France, the UK, Italy, possibly Poland, etc... have much farther-reaching interests than say Malta, Cyprus, and so on. Germany has the economic weight to build a large army, but has no political will to use it. Italy has the political will to use its army, but economically can no longer sustain its power-projection capabilities.

The point is, getting all 28 on board is extremely difficult, and if you try you end up with paralysis. Much better is to create smaller sub-groupings of like-minded countries, who are willing to share burdens and actually use the capabilities when the time calls for it.

true,Wild_Haggis_Hunter,null,null,"My recommendation would be to opt for a 'longstay' visa even if you plan to move around in Europe. The main reason is the way visas work in the Schengen Area. The Schengen Area is a group of 26 European countries that have abolished passport and immigration controls at their common borders. It functions as a single country for international travel purposes, with a common visa policy. 

How does a Schengen visa work ?, On the day you first enter any country within the Schengen zone, you start a 180 day ""period"", within which you can stay a maximum of 90 days in all Schengen countries. After you have racked up your 90 days (in one go, or in several chunks if you leave to non-Schengen countries &amp; come back), you can't enter any Schengen country again until your 180 period ends. Which european countries belong to the Schengen Area and which don't ? [Here's the list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area).

So if you plan on staying in Europe longer than 90 days, go for a long-stay visa, you'll save yourself the trouble of getting a renewal and having to deal with our dreadful paperwork mania.

On the issue of the free market its a phenomenon it exists but is corrupted by government intervention, market manipulation and consumer foolishness, It however is still the only thing that can hurt our corporate overlords, and this is why capitalism is better than anything else, even the strong can fall, which is something that never existed in any system before, previously the only way to change a rulling class was to change the entire system.

true,DonQuiHottie,null,null,"I think the main problem with Spain is that Spaniards (and I'm one) have always preferred complaining about things to taking steps to change them (Franco died in bed, not because of a revolution, after all).

But let's take a look at your complaints.

The political system is not ""completely broken"" at all. It's apparently fashionable this decade in Spain to blame everything on politicians. In the past we blamed the English and their black legends, or the judeomasons and their conspiracies, now it's politicians turn. The problem with such practice is that it absolves the ordinary citizen of any role in Spain's problems, and consequently of any need to take their share of responsibility and blame. The examples that you give regarding the decline of the political system (changes to abortion law, violent protests being outlawed, higher taxes) don't actually showcase a declining political system, they're just examples of policy changes you don't agree with (for the record, I don't agree with ANY of them either, quite the opposite, but I don't then extrapolate that to assuming the entire system is broken). If you don't like these policies, vote against them. If the parties proposing them happen to still gain a majority vote and can therefore continue in power and continue implementing them, that's how a democracy works. In Spain it often seems like ""democratic"" and ""the way I think things should be"" are taken to be synonymous, which is laughable.

The different police forces all perform vastly different but equally necessary functions and are largely staffed by honourable, hard-working, and underpaid men and women. The fact that some (in particular the riot police) need to be sternly disciplined and be held to higher standards than they are currently does not render the forces as a whole obsolete. I challenge you to find a first-world nation that has only a single police force throughout the nation, or one that functions with a significantly greater efficiency and lower number of complaints and flaws than their Spanish equivalents. Police brutality is an issue in many first-world nations, but there are measures that can and should be taken (and which you can push for democratically through our, I insist, not at all broken political system) that can remedy this without having to make all policemen suffer or see their image damaged.

There are better ways to remove underperforming politicians than simply crossing your arms and expecting them to step down. If you do not like a politician, don't vote for them. If they continue to be voted into office anyway, then your problem is not with politicians but with the electorate that enables them. Democracy: super simple stuff.

We're also suffering the consequences of an almost unpredicted (and therefore very hard to protect against) housing bubble bursting, and a more widely reaching global financial crisis that isn't the fault of politicians, or spanish bankers, or the police, or any other of your favourite scapegoats. Bad luck. We may, nay we most likely WILL, come out of this a stronger nation economically speaking. Whilst I do not agree with the politics of austerity as a solution, I am of the opinion that to semi-commit or to reverse said politics (which amongst other things could require such disastrous moves as leaving the euro or even the EU) now would be even more costly than to see through the path that has been chosen. There's not much we can do other than persevere now.

Perhaps you haven't travelled very much, or perhaps you have and haven't reached the same conclusions I have, but in my opinion, even with the unemployment and the constant national scandals and the whiny masses, there are few countries in the world that can offer a quality of life like that which Spain offers, even now when things are at their worst. When things get better, this will be even truer.

But if you must emigrate (and the only reason I could understand you doing this would be if you were absolutely unable to find satisfactory employment, not any of the fundamentally unsound socio-political reasons you give in your post) allow me to recommend south america, which has a perfect mix of no language barrier, booming economies, and a similar culture to ours. Peruvian cuisine is particularly amazing.

Whatever you choose, I hope I've managed to provide a slightly different perspective on the situation in Spain. Things aren't as bad as you think, and what is bad is not bad for the reasons which you seem to think it is. Not to mention, it will only get better from here.

You **do** realize that this is the main problem, don't you?

I don't condone the government, and, I've to admit, I hate the current one with a flaming passion I couldn't ever imagine before. But complaining about what's happening with others and failing to see the same mistakes on our own people, that's how Spain historically worked. Face it, you cannot point out the corruption at higher levels and be an advocate for tax evasion. That makes little sense.

Let's take a look at all those Scandinavian countries. Their citizens know the value society gets from government taxes and, at the same time, refuse to take part on any form of corruption. They punish their politicians **and** neighbours, if they get caught. That's how it works, a sane position. In Spain, while things are ""okay"", people see politicians like all those from Valencia or Malaga, for instance, like real smart, self-made individuals who deserve their attention. Self-employed workers usually ""ignore"" to pay some taxes, because, hey, everyone does that.

So how can we expect politicians to behave like honest people when we, the people, don't like that?

People does not acknowledge the value of all those public services they used to enjoy, and now they miss them. Don't want to pay more taxes, fuck the government, but do want public healthcare!

What the fuck...

And so, the next ""wealthy"" period will be the same. People will vote for that dude because the city looks beautiful. The guy from the garage will still advise you against getting the legally required bill. Public companies will be sold to very good friends of some politicians and nobody will notice.

You asked for some thoughts, here's mine: stop whining.

This is what most people deserve, a shitload of taxes in a collision vector straight to their faces. But the worst thing is, when all this crap is over, nobody would ever know what happened and they will still be the same. They'll claim for lower taxes and care about nothing else, get another credit, buy a car, a house, quit college, work for the services industry, and so on. Everything will start again, because most people are morons.

So people, avoid paying taxes. Vote for some new political party whose leader promises you to fix all the issues people don't want to take any responsibility for but, at the same time, have been voting the same as PSOE, PP and all those shitbags. Say proudly ""I have a new house"" when it actually belongs to the bank. Stay at home when that public service you don't care enough is privatized. Blame the doctors if one of your relatives dies in the operation table, instead of the ill funded public healthcare system administrators. Don't give a fuck about the half a million euro car some random major gets, until some newspaper says anything about it. Go to your team stadium and sing and yell for almost two hours straight, but refuse to take the streets to defend something that actually matters.

true,akasha_lc,null,null,"Thanks for your reply, excellent insights but let me answer back a few things....

&gt;  If you don't like these policies, vote against them. If the parties proposing them happen to still gain a majority vote and can therefore continue in power and continue implementing them, that's how a democracy works. In Spain it often seems like ""democratic"" and ""the way I think things should be"" are taken to be synonymous, which is laughable.

Yes, that is how democracy works, however, why do we have to wait so many years for the chance? Isnt popular opinion on abortion well known enough for politicians not to touch it? Why do we have to swing around every couple of years, between allowing it and then prohibiting it? The only time Ive seen popular opinion change anything was the recent 11% price hike in electricity, finally the goverment said, ""Uh, wait a moment, lets think about this"". When people complained enough...

&gt;  I challenge you to find a first-world nation that has only a single police force throughout the nation, or one that functions with a significantly greater efficiency and lower number of complaints and flaws than their Spanish equivalents.

The United Kingdom and Norway, to name 2, The United Kingdom actually has two, the BTP (British Transport Police, armed and transport only, trains, airports.) and they do a much better job with lower crime rates than Spain and can be seen often in towns and centres, and are very friendly and approachable if you have any problems or questions. On the other hand, my experience with Spanish police ranges from getting pulled over at night to be questioned on where I am going, who I am, where is my ID, have I been drinking, lets brethalize you anyway and check all your documentation. I feel like a criminal.

I feel like a guilty man trying to prove my innocence. Why do more people not feel like this?

&gt; We're also suffering the consequences of an almost unpredicted (and therefore very hard to protect against) housing bubble bursting, and a more widely reaching global financial crisis that isn't the fault of politicians, or spanish bankers, or the police, or any other of your favourite scapegoats.

I have to disagree there... Huge amount of illegal building by greedy banks and investors (promotores) resulting in vast complexes of badly built and illegal homes, ayuntamientos giving licenses in exchange for bribes and sometimes not even issuing at all leaving property in legal limbo... Lets not forget the Spanish bankers at Bankia, the Barcenas fiasco, or all the other Spanish banks that gave morgages to people whos income cannot cover the expense but hey! You have a pulse so you can have one....

&gt; Perhaps you haven't travelled very much, or perhaps you have and haven't reached the same conclusions I have, but in my opinion, even with the unemployment and the constant national scandals and the whiny masses, there are few countries in the world that can offer a quality of life like that which Spain offers, even now when things are at their worst. When things get better, this will be even truer.

Now this I agree with, the roads are great, the people and lifestyle is great, but if this country didnt have sunshine, gone would be the tourism sector and gone would be even the Spaniards happiness. Place Spain above France on the map and things would get ugly fast in my opinion. The good weather and tourists coming is what is keeping us afloat at the moment.

&gt; Whatever you choose, I hope I've managed to provide a slightly different perspective on the situation in Spain. Things aren't as bad as you think, and what is bad is not bad for the reasons which you seem to think it is. Not to mention, it will only get better from here. In any case, best of luck to you, whatever you may choose.

Problem is, you expect it to be better, and so you're less interested in paying taxes. So don't pay, SS doesn't have a dime to spend not only in healthcare but all kinds of social protection, and so other people, including you, won't have anything. Think about it, who started this trend? And aren't we entitled to pay when cash is gone because we didn't want to pay when it was flowing?

Someone has to break this circle, and if you or anyone else expect politicians to put an end on this, well, be patient then.

Let me say something about those public services I used as examples.

People expect healthcare to be free, not public. Free as in free beer, so they don't need to pay. However, they don't want to pay taxes or they try to avoid them. That makes no sense at all.

Privately owned highways are not the best in Spain because they don't exist at all. Roads are public, all of them, but some maintenance and building resources are from private companies which, in exchange, charge us, the people who first put the money, to use them. In Malaga you may have fair weather, but take a look at Bilbao, Zaragoza, A Coruña or Oviedo, where privately maintained highways are just a joke. Sure, they're designed with a nice outline and high capacity in mind, so what? I found dead animals in highways everytime I go to Galicia, great job...

Now, education. Laws are making it a joke, not people. When you push a kid to study even when he doesn't want to, or allow book publishers to edit poorly written and somewhat modified books year by year, that's working against us. And every five years or so, new education laws are passed just because. Tell me if that's how it's supposed to be.

By the way, taxes in the UK may be lower but not that lower. SS tax rates for self employed workers include not only healthcare, so I guess you got that wrong, because 50 euro for public healthcare plus unemployment protection plus social protection plus pensions is highly unlikely.

The government is trying to decrease the private sector salaries for non-management positions(the last 4 trimesters the wages have decreased), promoting the replacement of permanent employees with temporary workers and day laborers, cutting unemployment benefits, giving subsidies for hiring people younger than 30, extending the probation time to a year(declared contrary to some international treaty that we signed recently) and the government approved recently a reform to pay the overtime of part time workers with the normal pay instead of the overtime pay, making cheaper the objective layoffs(but half of the new cases like an employee that has been sick more than 9 days are in court, actually all the reforms are in court)...

And some other things...

[Nothing of the sort](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estudis_del_suport_social_a_la_independ%C3%A8ncia_de_Catalunya). And people are getting more and more pissed off as they see how the Spanish government is handling the issue.

&gt; lets see what happens.

The referendum is how we'll actually precisely know what the Catalan people want. Polls seem to show it's independence, but they're just polls; we want the referendum so that what the Catalan people want is known for sure.

&gt; do you really thing Catalonia will be better off alone

Give a look at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Autonomy_of_Catalonia#Legal_challenge_.26_the_Catalans.27_response). Considering the Catalan people **voted for it in a referendum in 2006**, after having been negotiated and OK'd with the spanish government (with lots of compromising), only to have this happen to it in 2010, we're left with little recourse if we want to *continue existing as a people*. We do not [give up half the taxes we pay](http://www.prouespoli.cat/uploads/1/1/4/2/11420201/fulleto-a4-angles.pdf) for the rest of the state to use so that we are then treated like this.

&gt; what things would you like to see changed?

I, like many of us, would have liked to steer Spain so that it grew into a great country that values, respects and nurtures the many cultures and peoples who form it. We've been trying really hard ever since the transition to no avail. At the present point, we've simple given up on that, so we just want to go our own way and best wishes to our neighbors.

&gt; What are the thoughts of the Catalonian people on this subject?

The Catalan people voted into parliament the current **2/3** of the Catalan parliament that supports the referendum *as they promised during their electoral campaigns*. Right now, all we want to is to, precisely, figure out what the Catalan people want, which polls seems to indicate is independence.

And the government's refusal to let the referendum be held is just seen as more **disrespect**, **contempt** and **humiliation** from Spain, it only demonstrates how real a problem there is and does little to convince the Catalan people that there's any value in remaining as just an autonomous community of Spain.",0,1388054679,null,0,1388057033,0,ceaez1s,t3_1tpeou,t1_ceaez1s,t1_ceae865,null,1427982105,-4,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,-4

Since the 2005's riots in the suburbs, they want to keep things peaceful at all costs. That means no police presence in some areas, no search warrants, unreal sentences, and so on... The governement is not serving the interests of the citizen anymore and that's why people should be allowed to step up.

Beside that, i totally agree with you; people can't be trusted and that's why i wouldn't even be part of this debate if french politicians were still acting in the interest of the L.A.C. (law abiding citizen) Unfortunately, this country is not a democracy atm and that's why we can't delegate to some higher entities the means of our security.

About this escalation thing, it's almost a complete non sense. Criminals have guns, that's a fact and nobody is really working to put an end to this. So what would escalation look like? Each criminal would have two guns under their mattress for each one in the hand of the L.A.C.? What matters is not the amount of guns in circulation, but the difference between the potential of nuisance of the criminal and the ability of the L.A.C. to stand up for his safety. If your so called ""escalation"" reduces this disparity, i'm definitely into it.

Finally, you can't compare our country and yours. In the US, most crimes are the facts of gangs, drug addicts and people with psychological/psychiatrical issues. Do you really think that a state without gun would mean less crime if you don't change the way you are dealing with those three things? So here is my advice.

Ah bon ? Première nouvelle ! J'imagine du coup qu'il n'existe pas non plus de discours UMP, ni de discours PS ou PC, et que le FN se bat dans le vide. J'en déduis que le libéralisme, le socialisme, le nationalisme, le communisme, le fascisme, l'anarchisme, le libertarianisme, bref tous les -ism, sont aussi vides de substances. 

J'entends discours dans un sens large, non pas seulement réduit aux meetings électoraux, aux débats télévisés et aux programmes politiques, mais bien comme [un ensemble d'énoncés qui ont les mêmes règles de fonctionnement pas seulement linguistiques mais socio-politiques, d'où l'importance du contexte historique et de la position dans l'espace social](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyse_du_discours).

Le coeur du discours FN se trouve bien entendu résumé [ici](http://www.frontnational.com/le-projet-de-marine-le-pen/).

Je ne vais pas rentrer dans ton petit jeu des citations et parcourir des dizaines et des dizaines de pages de commentaires pour retrouver la phrase où tu affirmes ceci ou cela. Je me rappelle juste que tu as déjà déclaré appartenir au FN et que nombre de tes remarques vont dans le sens du souverainisme, du rejet de l'UE (se torcher avec un drapeau européen), d'une dénonciation des élites (des ""traitres""), d'une critique abondante des médias, des partis de gouvernement PS, UMP, centristes, d'un souci sécuritaire... Par ailleurs, tu es toujours présent pour monter au créneau dès que quelqu'un aborde les thèmes du FN, de l'extrême droite ou d'une énième polémique identitaire et sécuritaire.

La doctrine FN doit surement être trop sophistiqué pour moi, vu que j'en dis n'importe quoi, mais voilà ce que je crois pouvoir résumer de manière non-exhaustive sur son programme (l'ensemble constitue le programme FN, mais des éléments internes peuvent aussi être partagés par d'autres partis):

* souverainisme: sortie de l'UE jugée comme une impasse et un diktat de la troïka, volonté de retrouver une souveraineté monétaire (retour au franc) et une souveraineté territoriale (droit d'asile et de visa de l'espace Schengen).

* rejet des élites: les dirigeants politiques sont tous des corrompus, des traitres, ou au mieux des soumis à la tyrannie financière des marchés. Les partis politiques traditionnelles vivent pour eux-mêmes sans se soucier du peuple.D'où nécessité d'un renouveau du personnel.

* populisme: appel constant au peuple, par opposition aux élites. Eloge d'éléments de démocratie directe 

* organicisme: il va de pair avec son populisme, cad que le peuple est vu comme un tout, un corps, dont les membres constituent entre autres les organes. Suivant les sensibilités on ajoute comme organes l'Eglise ou la famille. Ce peuple-Un est menacé par divers dangers: soit des corps étrangers (l'immigration en particulier arabo-musulmane) soit par des corps internes corrompus (partis politiques, médias, mais aussi criminels et délinquants).
 
* dimension sécuritaire: corolaire de ce que je viens d'énoncer, en bon parti de droite, la doctrine sécuritaire du FN est plutôt répressive. Il va plutôt dans le sens d'un alourdissement des peines (jusqu'au rétablissement de la peine de mort) afin de protéger la société de ses maux internes (criminalité et délinquance). 

* repli communautaire: deux variantes à ce repli. Soit un repli davantage nationaliste où il s'agit de renforcer avant tout une communauté nationale propre, la nation française. Soit une vision plus européenne dans le dynamique [volkisch](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouvement_v%C3%B6lkisch) où il s'agit plutôt de défendre une Europe blanche et chrétienne dans un monde en compétition, surtout culturelle et religieuse.

* protectionnisme: ce n'est que l'application du repli communautaire dans le domaine économique, dans le but de protéger les industries françaises en voie de désindustrialisation

* doctrine sociale exclusiviste: même application dans le domaine sociale, c'est la fameuse ""préférence nationale"". Aux vues des difficultés budgétaires, du déficit de la sécurité social et du chômage, les prestations sociales et les emplois doivent d'abord bénéficier aux nationaux

* ultra-laïcisme: combat contre toutes les manifestations visibles religieuses, jusqu'à remettre en cause l'actuel [liberté de conscience et de culte](http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2012/09/21/01002-20120921ARTFIG00460-marine-le-pen-contre-la-kippa-et-le-voile-dans-la-rue.php). C'est surtout une laïcité de façade destinée à lutter contre l'Islam puisque le FN, en cohérence avec la partie traditionnelle de son électorat, défend [l'héritage chrétien](http://www.frontnational.com/2013/03/la-destruction-des-eglises-de-france-doit-cesser/).

* doctrine sociétale plutôt traditionaliste: on l'a vu avec la réforme de l'avortement en Espagne, le FN semble plutôt pour une telle restriction. Également valorisation de la famille, des traditions, d'une histoire mythifiée autour de grands personnages (Jeanne d'Arc).

I think that's the main problem. I do believe that politicians represent quite nicely how a country is and, sadly, this is true in our case.

&gt; The political system is not ""completely broken"" at all. It's apparently fashionable this decade in Spain to blame everything on politicians. 

Our politicians suck. Our current government lied in their ""programa electoral"" (this is a VERY serious topic), they're corrupted (seriously, in which developed country can happen [this](http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/12/23/actualidad/1387803508_860121.html), [this](http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/08/29/actualidad/1377765625_514275.html) and everything /u/akasha_lc said without any social/political repercussion?), they changed the ""sacred"" constitution without asking us and they did it the day before an important soccer match , they [don't answer any questions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYm7omGCHs) the press asks (I still remember the president's [press conference with journalists in a different room](https://twitter.com/eldiarioes/status/297690179987177472/photo/1)), they directly [affect the decisions of the justice](http://www.eldiario.es/llamadmeismael/Gobierno-Hacienda-renuncie-infanta-fiscal_6_137246297.html)... [our government is just a joke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdbHSxdaWFw).
As I've said before, this is our own fault. No matter the political views we have, we can't support a government who does all these on a regular basis and I can't believe they would still win if there were elections today. This is what worries me the most, we have no clue how to vote and what democracy means.

&gt; We're also suffering the consequences of an almost unpredicted (and therefore very hard to protect against) housing bubble bursting, and a more widely reaching global financial crisis that isn't the fault of politicians, or spanish bankers, or the police, or any other of your favourite scapegoats. Bad luck. We may, nay we most likely WILL, come out of this a stronger nation economically speaking. 

I don't agree with this. I always hear that the crisis and our current situation is just ""bad luck"", and the whole world's fault, but it isn't (it is only partially). Aznar's ""ley de suelo"" and corruption was the main engine of our economy and the reason why we were successful in the first place. He knew ([as many people](http://www.lasmalaslenguas.es/2008/08/28/la-herencia-de-aznar/)) that our economy was going to explode sooner or later and, instead of using the resources we earned thanks to those politics in something useful like I+D+i that could keep us on float when the bad time came, we kept building useless stuff.

&gt; Perhaps you haven't travelled very much, or perhaps you have and haven't reached the same conclusions I have, but in my opinion, even with the unemployment and the constant national scandals and the whiny masses, there are few countries in the world that can offer a quality of life like that which Spain offers, even now when things are at their worst. When things get better, this will be even truer.
But if you must emigrate (and the only reason I could understand you doing this would be if you were absolutely unable to find satisfactory employment, not any of the fundamentally unsound socio-political reasons you give in your post) allow me to recommend south america, which has a perfect mix of no language barrier, booming economies, and a similar culture to ours. Peruvian cuisine is particularly amazing.

We must realize that we are in a very difficult situation. [This](http://www.espiaenelcongreso.com/2013/12/24/colapso-en-los-comedores-sociales-de-espana-por-el-dia-de-navidad-pero-los-politicos-lo-ocultan-o-lo-niegan/) is happening everyday, families are getting evicted, we have a incredibly high unemployment rate, salaries are very low, most jobs are awful (at least in the ""engineering market"", which is what I know), free education, free health service and scholarships are disappearing faster and faster, taxes are high in comparison to what we receive, [science and investigation](http://www.quo.es/ciencia/cierre-laboratorio-antrpologia-forense-granada) is less and worse everyday, [pensions are also worse than before and unstable](http://www.elblogsalmon.com/economia-domestica/que-plan-tienes-para-tu-jubilacion)...

* **Let's do the labour market less weird:** I am young but I am against subsidies to hire young people, that doesn't create employment. And all the special contracts: that have been created for job promotion only make the labour market more complicated. About the severance pay, it's in the EU average; it is cheaper than France, Italy and Germany but more expensive than UK, Austria or Ireland. But, it has a very high standard deviation because all the dozens of special cases that the government has introduced with irregular procedures are in court and when one is voided the companies that used it have to pay all the pending salaries until the veredict's date and then an non-objective layoff or rehire the employee. Besides that the definition of the objective layoff cases isn't very clear often and a  judgement for deciding if the usage of the case is right or no can take years.
* **Judicial system:** it's not even funny. The most simple case can take years. There isn't an efficient way of collecting debts, or resolving labour conflicts. justice is politicized and technologically obsolete.
* **local administration and bureaucracy:** for a software developer(like myself) is easy starting to create a company with only one employee and start working. 48 hours, that can be called quick. The big mess is the local and regional administration. Are you doing construction works? Let's get a certificate that says that there aren't archaeological objects in the area. Let's wait some months. Your bathrooms must meet regulations for handicapped people, wait a few months for inspection, emergency exits the same. Good luck dealing with local administrations outside certain cities. There isn't any government support the local administration and it's coordinated by the most corrupt institution the province.
* **Corruption:** We have too much, I am not sure about what to do about this. Most of the high officers of the government(and the [royal family](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gnlZqBjjgNWEyAtfITFvs72RdG7g?docId=CNG.9b7f33b760e33ef47d61c1afd7a5b14e.621&amp;hl=en)) are involved in corruption, and trying to protect other politicians from the Justice. I don't think that this is good for the economy.
* **A better elite selection system:** when our PM and half of the government are openly corrupt, the former president of the subsidized  Businessmen association is in prison for stealing the companies that he managed and dozens of high officers of the organization are involved in dirty stuff, the second biggest union(the one linked with the social-democratic opposition) has dozens of corruption affairs(mostly in connection with Andalusian regional government); something is fucked in the selection system. The more corrupt you are more quicky you will thrive.
* A clear division of powers among administrations. There are regulations about the same fields by regional, national and municipal administrations. And what regulation should be enforced changes with the central government alliances. It also changes with the region. You should comply with regional government in Catalonia, local government in Basque Country and national government in other places in some fields.
* **Retrain the labour force:* 50% of the jobless are completely unskilled. However we applied austerity to it and we have less budget for that than when the unemployment was 8%. The vocational training system(trades or whatever you call it) is completely fucked also. Spain has a serious gap 30% of people with a college degree, 25% without basic education, 30% with basic education and the rest with some kind of extra education that doesn't lead to any qualified or semi-qualified position.

This is the more neutral reforms only. I tried to avoid anything ideological, but I think that these things at least are needed.

- Send people into nonsensical training programmes (learn to write an application for a fourth time this year) because being in a programme means you're not actively looking for work, therefore you aren't unemployed.

- Look the other way when companies use every dodgy method available to them to circumvent actually hiring people (which comes with labour protections) and paying them more than a pittance. The state, then, is subsidising those pittances to achieve a half-way livable wage, not significantly higher than hand-outs for a standard week of work. Fighting against it is futile, as if you don't take those ""jobs"", they cut your dole (which is technically unconstitutional, but still done).

- In a strange reversal of the intent of HartzIV (activating people standing by on social services into the employment market) doing everything in their might for said activation to be mind-numbing and depressive, which opens up the possibility of a psych eval resulting in motivational and depression issues, classing people as (at least temporary) not capable of employment, and therefore not looking for employment, and therefore not unemployed.

Doesn't make it any less of a horrible and disgusting history. One you're so easy to brush away with ""The Empire was a force for good"".

Of course there was a lot more to it than slavery, but slavery in parallel with imperialism is not something to be brushed away so easily. It at least turns the judgment of ""being a force for good"" into question and exposes it as nationalist propaganda.

&gt; I'm afraid until another group of people do something as horrible as what Nazi germany did, it will always be at the forefront of peoples minds. 

No, it will be on the forefront of British people's mind because there is a nationalist agenda in the remembrance.

La critique te concernant provenait de nos discussions (comme [celle-là](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1o5puj/didier_porte_nous_donne_des_pistes_pour_savoir/ccpjnrg)) sur la ""nature"" et ""l'identité"" du FN. Elle n'était pas méritée, tes commentaires sont en fait pertinents et réfléchis.

Je te présente mes excuses, mon commentaire était inutilement méprisant, j'ai interprété le tien comme une provocation.

Malheureusement, et je le déplore, le FN comme tous les autres partis a perdu une vision long terme et une cohérence. C'est pour cela que j'ai publié cet article. La phrase importante était ""le vote FN, pour **remettre ce pays face à ses responsabilités**"". Je ne crois pas que le FN, même remanié et avec un nouveau nom, sera un jour au pouvoir. L'enjeu est plutôt de secouer les élites pour obtenir des changements avant qu'il ne soit trop tard (c'est à dire la guerre civile ou bien la dissolution de la France).

&gt; Ah bon ? Première nouvelle ! J'imagine du coup qu'il n'existe pas non plus de discours UMP, ni de discours PS ou PC, et que le FN se bat dans le vide.

Il y a des lignes opposées depuis le début, et aujourd'hui, il y a encore la ligne ""mariniste"", sociale et antilibérale, et de l'autre côté, il y a la ligne ""lepéniste"", focalisée sur la sécurité, l'immigration, les profiteurs etc. Donc non, pas de ""discours FN"" tout comme il n'y a pas de discours Front de Gauche, et encore moins UMP. Le PS n'a pas d'idées, donc pas de discours depuis 1983 et l'abandon du socialisme, hormis une vague idée européïste, et le monopole du cœur.

&gt;J'en déduis que le libéralisme, le socialisme, le nationalisme, le communisme, le fascisme, l'anarchisme, le libertarianisme, bref tous les -ism, sont aussi vides de substances.

On s'est mal compris sur la définition de ""discours"", ce que tu cites ne sont pas des partis politiques mais au contraire des idées qui permettent un discours. Ces idées sont présentes de manière assumée au FN : on a eu des libéraux, des anarchistes, des communistes, des socialistes, et des gens qui aujourd'hui seraient qualifiés de libertariens. Il y a eu des fascistes, je pense que les épurations ont marché car je n'en n'ai croisé aucun.

&gt;Je me rappelle juste que tu as déjà déclaré appartenir au FN et que nombre de tes remarques vont dans le sens du souverainisme, du rejet de l'UE (se torcher avec un drapeau européen), d'une dénonciation des élites (des ""traitres""), d'une critique abondante des médias, des partis de gouvernement PS, UMP, centristes, d'un souci sécuritaire...

C'est effectivement un très bon résumé.

J'exprime mon point de vue, souvent partagé par des personnalités extérieures au FN, sur des questions politiques.

En particulier, la sortie de l'euro selon Jacques Sapir, l'opposition au mondial-libéralisme de Maurice Allais, une réduction de la coûteuse immigration non éduquée comme le prouvent le CAE et l'OCDE, et la *certaine idée de la France* et de sa place dans le monde qu'avait de Gaulle, avec les réformes des institutions que cela impose (disons Chouard comme c'est la mode, mais je préfère [Castoriadis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJCq6Vy_YRM)). Je défends aussi le salaire citoyen, avec une démocratie plus directe, comme une sorte de [misthos](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misthos) dans une Athènes du XXIème siècle. Ces thèses s'appuient souvent sur les outils d'analyse de Marx, ce qui engendre une opposition avec la classe dominante que j'appelle l'élite et des médias qu'elle contrôle.

Tant mieux si le FN reprend une partie de ces thèses. J'ai été au Parti de Gauche avant, et certaines de ces thèses y étaient également populaires. Par contre, évidemment, dès que tu parles d'immigration au PdG, tu es traité de fasciste, ce qui n'est pas le cas au FN.

&gt;Cet exercice comprend bien des limites et n'est pas complet, mais même avec ça, le FN ne me parait pas à des lieux de ce que je viens d'énoncer.

C'est assez juste. J'aurais des remarques sur des points précis, mais on aura l'occasion d'en parler plus tard, si ça t'intéresse.

Pour répondre à ta question première : je partage mes idées, à l'intérieur du FN, mais aussi à l'extérieur. Sur reddit, ça me permet de les poser à l'écrit, avec des sources, de voir les arguments contre, de voir leur popularité, et surtout de réfléchir à des améliorations pour mieux les maîtriser à l'oral.

Par exemple, je suis assez content car le prochain programme (de 2017) ne devrait plus comporter de quotas d'immigration, et c'est une idée que j'ai défendue et qui suscite beaucoup d'opposition en interne. 
C'est un exemple mais grâce aux posts sur reddit, on a pu convaincre qu'une certaine partie de l'immigration posait problème, et qu'une autre ne posait pas de problème.

I signed up to Twitter because I was bored during summer break. In the beginning I had this WTF-do-I-do with Twitter, too. I don't quite remember if I followed celebrities or not, but I made sure that I had some real people in my Timeline. 
Like a friend once said: ""The fun on twitter hides behind the @."" (Writing replies to other tweets and getting replies to other replies.) You simply don't get that from celebrities.

I joined Twitter around 4-5 years ago and since then I met my soul mate, most of my marketing and PR contacts, got my first job, organized 3 tweetups (meetups) with a group of people I met on twitter. We had 100-200 participants each time. Currently, the 4th one is being planed. All of this in Germany! 
If anyone is interested, I am willing to elaborate (AMA).

I think the biggest mistake new users make is to use twitter as a news source. It is boring and does not encourage you to look further. However, if you look at Twitter as a mean to meet new people, you will have much more fun and are much more likely to enjoy it.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"The UK's economy may still be 2% smaller than pre-peak, and GDP per capita about 5% below! but it's gaining on those peaks quite quickly. GDP per capita in the UK is already higher than in Germany and the peak levels were almost seven per cent higher than Germany's current level, it's peak. The UK is battling it out with the USA for the worlds fastest growing developed economy right now so I don't think it's unrealistic to expect the UK, per capita, will continue to outpace Germany. 

As to Savings, the UK sustained a bad situation for quite some time; they'll be rebuilt. Employment is already rapidly recovering - economists are working based off of 100000 jobs being added a month - and that will lead to real terms wage increases and a better savings situation. Regarding the types of jobs, your assertion that they're all low paid isn't true. The profile of the market is much the same now as it was before, with the proportion of full time jobs to part time jobs being almost exactly the same. 

The article is talking about absolute terms, size matters on the international stage. But it's also implicit that the UK will have higher productivity that Germany because Germany will still have a higher population at that stage. Quality of life? Well, we'll see. The UK had for a long time some of the largest levels of disposable income, I imagine that situation will gradually reassertion itself once competition for labour heats back up. Going on current trends, that'll probably be sooner than most people here expect. 


As to your financial services comment, how does it have little real relevance? They provide well paid jobs, are a net service export and are necessary for the function of the economy. Sure, some aspects might be irrelevant but insurance? Accounting? Forex? I think rather than the figures being biased by financial services, it is you that is biased.

true,gensek,ESTO,Estmark,"&gt;I'd say they did, considering the Tsar was trapped inside by a sieging army. The De La Gardie forces forced that army away.

I wouldn't call that capturing, as they didn't take it by force from whoever held it at the time. Also, Moscow wasn't technically under siege. The pretender's headquarters were nearby, and his supporters largely controlled the surrounding areas, but they weren't laying siege. It was more of a lazy blockade kind of situation.

&gt;From what I've read the agreement said nothing about the Poles. All it was about was rescuing the Tsar.

Yup, but the Tsar extended the contract following them dealing with Dimitri. The mercenaries were bolstered by 20000-30000 locals (moral was rather high after their success) and sent south against the Poles. And we all know how that went;)

&gt; It then dropped down to 1200 men (De La Gardie himself) after the mercenaries left because they didn't get paid.

Most of them left literally _during the battle_ with the numerically vastly inferior Polish side (who'd surprised them in camp). It's not that they didn't get paid, their monthly wages had arrived with no more delay than usual. It's that the wages were only partially in actual money, the rest in furs and shit like that, which the mercenaries didn't very much like. They'd had a bad experience a while earlier when, as they were fighting around Moscow, their _allies_ had looted their camp and taken their shitty so-called-wages. For a mercenary, the only payment worth getting was cash that could be carried around with them.

There's also a theory that De la Gardie specifically delayed the payment so he'd have to pay out less after the battle. When the tide started turning against him he started handing out cash quickly (effectively a bidding war between him and the Poles), but he was beaten up by the mercs, lost all of it, and only survived thanks to Swedes and Finns whom he'd paid first.

&gt; On peut regarder au niveau extra européen aussi: aux Etats-Unis, l'énergie est moins chère.

The upper echelons did certainly. That may seem important, but I doubt the common man cared or mattered much at the time. There wasn't a great deal of inter-colony flow of people by comparison. The colonies readily accepted immigrants from Europe without regard for their background, and they found a way to communicate when needed. I believe the inital colonies were mostly settled by the English and their Scottish, Welsh and Irish workers; each with their own [non-English] languages to be precise. 

&gt;should we expect something like a USE in the next century or two?

I expect it will evolve in that direction, mostly due to global competition and the need to use our resources more effectively. I'm not advocating either way, as my country har rejected the EU twice.

Europeans are quite capable of competing. Just look at Germany's exports, [they're set to export more than the US](http://www.thelocal.de/20130816/51437)! 

However, we're all spending far too much on separate solutions to common problems (security/military, immigration, transport networks, communication networks, diplomacy and embassies etc). 

The EU has done a great deal to ease and force open trade between member states. Which has resulted in lower prices for consumers, more competition between old incumbents and national champions. The result is better utilization of limited resources within Europe, but also for products exported abroad.

&gt;I mean, it won't be more than a few generations before virtually all EU citizens are fluent in English, 

I suppose that might happen, we're quite proficient as it is, but you seem to think that means we will speak and use English internally? That's a mistake, our languages will not die or be replaced by English. The minute I leave this page I will resume speaking in my native language to my friends and family.

&gt;multiple factors are dissolving cultural barriers between Europe's peoples.

This is a seriously flawed observation, argument and conclusion. I could write books on the subject, in the end it comes down to the fact that we're not united but divided by our disparate cultural, ethnic, historic, geographic/climatic, religious and linguistic backgrounds. Issues I believe  will persist, not despite Google, but thanks to digital support.

While it's easy for a Polish man to emigrate to the UK, or an Italian to Sweden, they're far from natural fits or natives. There's a reason you can hire cultural guides in places like China; and [why the Economist has podcasts for ""doing business in""](http://podgallery.org/economist-doing-business-in/). 

For that matter I doubt you will ever have an Italian man as Prime Minister of the UK, unless he's native born and raised.

Dans mon McDo le McCafé fermait à 21h30, les pâtisseries qui se périmaient durant la nuit étaient donc laissées à la disposition des employés sans coûter de points. Cela permettait donc de se faire des plateaux un peu plus chargés sans pour autant dépasser les 10 points.

I don't think it will be, but I think it ought to be. I'm an unabashed idealist, yeah.

&gt; And doesn't that make BOTH of us dick riders??

Oh, I didn't mean to call you a dick rider. I was thinking of the big business that is the war on terror, and war in general, and the dick riders are the people who sell it to us, at the behest of their handlers. I mean, remember when the cold war ended, and nobody skipped a beat, and simply found *other* justifications for military budgets so huge one prolly could feed the whole world with them? Which would be likely to make a few friends here and there, and pay off defense-wise in that way -- but it would mean trading less benefit for a select few people for a lot of benefit for everybody, and that's why it doesn't happen. That's the *only* reason it doesn't happen... not security, and surely not democracy, but private profits at public expense. Shrivelled old men and the symbols in their head, and the number on their bank account, good for nothing and not going anywhere. I see diseased people who not only don't know they're diseased, they're actually trying to sell the disease as a cure for a disease they made up... and everybody who is trying to make others fall for that is riding their flaccid dicks.

When Bush talked about how we couldn't afford to find evidence for Saddam's WMD in the form of a mushroom cloud, or Colin Powell in cold sweat in front of the UN with a hilarious presentation of grainy pics that show nothing, but ""could"" be something dangerous -- riding dicks in full view on a high wire. And while I might be able to forgive at some point, I will never be able to unsee that.

Are you familiar with the works of Bill Hicks? Obama also likes to act all somber and smart, but in fact he's really just a tiny flea riding a big, scaly dick. Or, as horrible a segue this is, UK peeps going on and on about child porn and whatnot to get a foot in the door for internet censorship. Or hey, to be fair, fundamentalist preachers who USE the West being such a pig in the Middle East, and send others off to die. They have smaller profits, but it's the same principle, and they ride the dick of a perverted and cherry-picked Quran. Just like the dick riders in the west use the dick riders in the Middle East being pigs to send their own off to die (or, which I would argue is even worse, to be slaughterers), for their own profit.

(not that I mean this in a sexist way; there is nothing wrong with women or homosexual men. But I still like ""dick riding"" as figure of speech, though I know I shouldn't haha)

If that doesn't count as capturing Moscow, then neither should would it count for the Polish. Exactly the same thing happened with them, they defeated an army outside the city and were then allowed into Moscow.

The situation is very bleak. That make sense.

&gt; Is there any political party capable of making the necessary reforms?

The current government(PP/conservatives) concentrates all the powers has an absolute majority and control the justice. But, they lack the will to reform. Honestly the best Spanish parties with an acceptable leadership and a clear project are Basque and Catalan nationalist.

As alternative parties in Spain we have:

* United Left: not actually united, the party with the most constant internal fights: having libertarian communist, eco-socialists and ex-communists(don't ask about their current ideology, they don't know either), and generic left-wing like the current leader and former farmers union leader in the same coalition isn't easy. They already had some fights for the next EU elections because don't agree in if we should continue in the EU and the Euro. Julio Anguita,  [The most respected previous leader created recently a citizens platform](http://www.frentecivicosomosmayoria.es/quienes-somos/), actually is the only left platform one with a clear project for the country, left wing policies and euroscepticism.
* UPyD: moderate party without a clear ideology, it has been officially center-left and center-right. It was founded by a high officer of the Socialist Party(Rosa Diez) after losing the internal elections for the leadership(the United left was already fighting for left wing voters thus she created a *center* party). The party is growing steadily and with the current conservative government they have been a populist, Spanish nationalist and moderate conservative opposition party. 
* Equo: recently a Green coalition separated from the United Left has been created by the former leader of the Spanish branch of Greenpeace, very weak.

On the bright side the biggest party to right of the ruling party has 20,000 voters. There isn't any racist or xenophobic party in any Spanish regional or national parliament. However, this isn't surprising even our right-wing dictatorship wasn't exactly xenophobic and our dictator had [Moorish bodyguards](http://forum.axishistory.com/download/file.php?id=22943&amp;sid=b6935ef55fb1b9fab4d9095fdc05b8b3).

&gt; If not, how can they be made?

Creating a party in Spain isn't exactly difficult: a lot of them have been created. I don't expect any new big party in the next years; unless in the left Julio Anguita and his *Frente Civico*(Civic Fron) or the Plataforma de Afectados por la hipoteca(Mortgage Victims Association) participate in it. And it's unlikely. In the right: some right wing liberals got a lot of money and created the P-Lib supportting privatizations, welfare and education cuts, free market reforms, and a more regressive tax system and they got around 2,000 voters and their advertising was everywhere. I think there is political space for a traditionalist conservative anti-free market party, but I don't know what that would solve and the PP tries to cover also that and the pro-free market.

1. Minimum wage in central London, unless you have a place to stay or live in overcrowded conditions it's not viable at all, rent + transport + rates + bills is more than your income. Many immigrants do stuff like live in a friends shop or live 10 to a house.

2. unsecured jobs in high cost areas, getting from the last dole payment to the first pay check for a temporary job is a huge gamble.

3. some jobs aren't even advertised in the UK at all, fruit picking for example.

4. Commission only sales, this is a complete scam preying on the desperate no one should ever take it, if your good enough to profit here just cut out the middle man. IMO calling this a job is taking the piss really.

5. less than 16 hour week, you usually end up with less money which would be an insane thing to do.

Quite often a few of these apply this isn't people being lazy it's being rational.

And secondly, we don't really need a certain individual who tells us what's right and wrong. Basically because he may adapt the message to his own interest. Maybe the ""leaders"" have come to an end, and we just need more horizontal associations and entities to represent the citizenship. But that's a maybe (and probably also a personal wish)

The only source of what I said is indeed anecdotal, after living in the UK for 2 years. Maybe not long enough, but from the 5 European countries I've lived in for that period, the British definitely win when it comes to over-estimating themselves. 

And no hatred for the UK at all, it's a great country and I enjoyed it a lot, also have many friends there, and I still regularly visit! There are many great things to say about it. 

I just think it would be better if some of the people I've met would be less blinded by national pride, start building some double glazed windows and see what thing other countries are doing better than the UK. If everybody does that (also France, Germany, etc) we will all improve... 

Everybody tends to think that what they are familiar with/where they grew is the best. Just like the french think their language is superior... It's just because they everybody tends to think of their own stuff as the best and things that are alien or different as less good... 

I can't help but think that a lot of people in the UK live too much in a bubble, lacking 'the other perspective'. There is a big difference in perception about britain between the british and the non-british. Of course you can blame 'the others' for ignorance and this is partly correct, but also think there is some blind national pride...

&gt; tu m'as balancé un vieux lien qui n'avait qu'un rapport très vague avec le sujet et sans expliquer

Le lien vient de eurostat, et est en rapport direct avec le sujet puisqu'il parle de prix de l'énergie. En particulier, en France, l'état est intervenu pour faire baisser le coût de production, et même avec les taxes, ça compense largement le surcoût lié aux taxes, puisque le prix final est inférieur à la moyenne européenne, elle même inférieure à la moyenne de la zone euro.

&gt;Et puis je vais aller faire un cours de macro économie aux gens qui ne se chauffent pas l'hiver, ça leur fera une belle jambe quand je parlerai d'inélasticité...

Rien ne t'interdit de trouver des données qui appuient ton raisonnement. En l'absence de données, c'est du niveau de la discussion de comptoir au PMU du coin.

&gt;je clique sur le lien vers la dite crise et c'est le drame: dès la 3e ligne je lis ""capped retail electricity prices"". Plus loin en-dessous je lis ""partial deregulation"". Bref, vilain marché, bouh, vive le public.

Absolument, d'une part, la dérégulation partielle dans un oligopole est bien pire que le monopole d'État. D'autre part, l'erreur de l'État a été de croire que la concurrence allait impliquer une baisse des prix. C'est particulièrement bête quand on regarde les contraintes du secteur de l'énergie, qui a bien plus de chances de mener à un oligopole.

La dérégulation totale n'est bénéfique qu'en situation qui s'approche [d'une concurrence pure et parfaite](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrence_pure_et_parfaite), ce qui n'a aucune chance d'arriver sur le secteur de l'énergie, pour les raisons économiques que j'ai citées ci-dessus.",0,1388085877,null,0,false,0,ceamktz,t3_1tlkr5,t1_ceamktz,t1_ceal1ho,null,1427978485,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

I'm less certain of that these days.

Putin seems to be betting that building up a group of allies will foster enough economic activity that him creating more money will be justified. If Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and all the various other countries can manage to get on the same page then his bet might work. After all, Putin seems like a pretty smart guy.

My thoughts : 

1) Camping is probably the cheapest way to do it, yes, but Paris and La cote d'azur are expensive places, and if you want to do this during summer, even camping may be expensive in crowded areas (like la cote d'azur :) )

2) Here's a price comparaison between [Paris and Hamburg](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=France&amp;country2=Germany&amp;city1=Paris&amp;city2=Hamburg) Do check out other cities to see the difference.

3) It will always be cheaper if you book in advance. Sometimes much cheaper.  [Voyages sncf](http://www.voyages-sncf.com/) to book. Pretty sure you can book straight from the german DB as well.

4) train tickets : as early as you can. Camping : most of the times 
they won't let you make a reservation in crowded areas, you'll just have to show up in the morning and see if they have space, which can be a bit tricky if you are using a bike.

[Le lien que tu nous donnes](http://www.linternaute.com/actualite/histoire/les-origines-de-noel/pourquoi-le-25-decembre.shtml) pour affirmer que ""Noël n'est pas religieux à la base"" nous précise d'emblée que:

&gt; La date à laquelle nous fêtons Noël est avant tout un héritage de la Rome Antique. Bien avant la naissance de Jésus de Nazareth, la fin de l'année solaire (le solstice d'hiver) est une période charnière, **pendant laquelle ont lieu de nombreuses célébrations vouées au culte du dieu des semailles et de la fertilité, Saturne**.

Ensuite, lorsque tu insistes sur le fait que ""Noël est une fête païenne"" et qu'on te fait remarquer que païen peut être synonyme de religieux, tu dégaines [la définition du paganisme par le Larousse](http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/paganisme/57228):

&gt; Nom donné par les chrétiens à l'état d'une population qui n'a pas encore été évangélisée.

Sauf que tu oublies soigneusement de donner la première définition que fournit ce même lien,

&gt; Nom donné par les chrétiens des premiers siècles au polythéisme, auquel les habitants des campagnes restèrent longtemps fidèles.

Donc c'est bien gentil d'affirmer que ""païen ne veut pas dire religieux"", mais tes sources te contredisent directement. Ce serait mieux de les lire en entier avant de les utiliser.

Tu es resté bloqué sur le vocabulaire d'aujourd'hui: lorsque l'on affirme que Noël est une fête ""païenne"", on veut dire par là que la société de consommation et la déchristianisation ont vidé le 25 décembre d'une grande partie de sa signification religieuse.

Mais lorsque l'on affirme qu'à l'origine, Noël  était une fête païenne, on veut simplement signifier que l'on est passé d'une célébration polythéiste à une célébration monothéiste: qu'on est passé d'une religion à une autre.

Ces ""païens"" ne célébraient pas la naissance d'un Jésus qui n'était pas encore né, mais célébraient le solstice d'hiver et tout un tas de mythes liés à différents dieux.

&gt;C'est un peu plus nuancé dans le Christianisme que dans l'Ancien Testament et dans le Coran, mais c'est à peu près ça.

Tout simplement car ta vision de leur ""principe philosophique"" est fausse. Trouve des textes qui montrent ce que tu dis, au lieu d'extrapoler à partir de ""on dit"". Par exemple, pour dire ""le Christianisme"", il faut ne pas bien connaître ce dont on parle, puisque la distinction entre catholicisme, protestantismes, et orthodoxie est primordiale.

&gt; Par exemple, pour dire ""le Christianisme"", il faut ne pas bien connaître ce dont on parle, puisque la distinction entre catholicisme, protestantismes, et orthodoxie est primordiale.

J'étais sûr que ce mot allait me revenir sur la gueule. J'ai justement utilisé les mots Christianisme et ""nuancé"" à cause de la nuance des différents courants chrétiens, ainsi que la particularité du Catholicisme qui est au moins en apparence moins coercitif que l'Islam et le Judaïme, qui eux dépeignent un Dieu vengeur et jaloux.


&gt; C'est faux au moins pour le catholicisme

Me répondre en me redirigeant sur église.catholique.fr, c'est cocasse. Imagine que je voulais te convaincre que l'homéopathie était efficace en te redirigeant sur boiron.fr.
La bible parle du ""feu qui ne s'éteint pas"" et des pécheurs, point, barre.
L'exégèse en elle-même est déjà un travail intellectuel et sort du domaine de la religion.

Bref, tout ça j'en ai rien à faire. Elle ne m'intéresse pas l'interprétation ou des uns et des autres, qu'elle soit faite par un fidèle, un membre isolé du clergé, le Pape himself. Je m'en suis bouffé suffisamment des machages, prémachages, remachages de sourate au gré des dissonances cognitives de chacun.

Ce n'est pas le placebo de la morale, c'est son antidépresseur : il apporte lui-même la molécule lorsqu'on en produit pas assez. Mais lorsqu'on a des outils pour apprendre à la produire soi-même, il faut abandonner le substitut et sa cohorte d'effets secondaires.

1. Campsites aren't dreadfully expensive, otherwise try wild camping. Yeah, it's illegal, but if you go somewhere secluded, arrive late and leave early, you're unlikely to get into trouble.
2. Yes, the Côte d'Azur is one of the poshest areas of France and thus expensive. For somewhere more affordable but equally beautiful and maybe even more interesting, you could try a bit farther west in the Camargue (the Languedoc-Roussillon région).
3. The cheapest offer I could find on bahn.de was 69€ without a BahnCard. Bear in mind that bikes are not allowed on board ICE and TGV trains, so you'll either need to travel by IC and Intercité de Nuit (a night train) which allow bikes (reservation is compulsory for bikes!) or rent bikes there (expensive). That means Deutsche Bahn's Europa-Spezial won't be available, check connections on [voyages-sncf.com](http://www.voyages-sncf.com) instead.
   If you don't need to take bikes, flying may be cheaper. [Coaches](https://www.eurolines.de/) are a lot cheaper, but slow, uncomfortable and don't allow bikes. 
4. Book everything as soon as possible. For trains that's three months in advance.
   For accommodation: If you're only pitching a tent, you can usually just show up, though you shouldn't rely on it in peak season, so it's always better to have a reservation. Research campsites in advance, maybe invest in a camping guide too.

Honestly, on your budget I would save the Côte d'Azur for when you're old and rich (you'll feel right at home). Even elsewhere € 600 for two people and two weeks frankly sounds unrealistic. That's € 20 a day for each of you to pay for accommodation, food, sights and transport (even if you're biking as you should budget for maintenance). This is ignoring getting to and from France, of course.

**Edit:** Another thing – can you go earlier? You wrote in another comment that you'll likely be going in July or August when the entire country will be on holiday and everywhere will be crowded and more expensive.

Living in the BRIC states may come with nice numbers for economic growth, but from the point of purchasing power or social stability, living in Europe is a bit more desirable. 

The idea, that a fincial sector could hold a countries economy was the basis of Thatchers devastating economic politics. The main argument against this is, that  there is no value added. Haldane and Madouros from the department of Financial Stability at the Bank of England have written an interesting paper about the question [What is the contribution of the financial sector?]( http://www.voxeu.org/article/what-contribution-financial-sector). They argue, that banks are basically just taking risks and make their profits from charging fees for providing financial products. If they pay high wages, they finance them by charging someone fees like interest rates or account maintenance fees. In the process of this, no additional value was created. For the case of commercial banks, one could argue that they have given someone a credit and therefore made someone elses economic activity easier. Investment banks are just using obscure financial tools to create some sort of revenue. Their activity can actually damage the economy. One example of such a damaging behaviour would be the investment fund Armajaro, who speculated on a price rise of Cocoa by buying 7% of the Futures for Cocoa, therby causing the price to rise after having bought these futures for a lower price. In the last ten years, more and more obscure investments have come up, with one of the most absurd beeing shadow markets, which mirror real stock markets, where investors trade with copies of real titles. These activities are not connected to the real economy and an increase in them may increase the GDP, but is of little real relevance.

In theory, these are 10000000000% accurate. In practicality, what /u/Frivilligit is saying is, let's say Spain and Ireland both have a stadium of 50,000, and on a particular match, both get filled up. The % of people in Ireland that attended would be far larger than Spain due to the disparities in population, but if the Spanish stadium was twice the size, it would have more than 50,000 people due to a larger population. 

Essentially, this makes it harder for large population countries to get higher percentages because both they and the smaller countries hit the attendance cap.

With all of that said, that doesn't invalid these statistics. It just contextualizes them.
