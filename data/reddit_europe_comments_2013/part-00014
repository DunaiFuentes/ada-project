Don't worry, I'm not going to say this.

&gt;our languages are different,

So are Switzerland's. The Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks spoke the same language, and that didn't stop them murdering each other. Hell, Northern Ireland is populated by two tribes practically indistinguishable from each other that very much hate each other despite language, significant ammount of culture, etc.

&gt;we're not even very close to each other geographically

Alaska, Hawaii, rest of the USA.

&gt;To top it all off, we know next to nothing about each others countries or cultures.

I know more about internet culture then the culture of some obscure ethnographic region of my country. But let's not get carried away with the „we know next to nothing about each other”. It sounds way more dramatic than it actually is.

&gt;If someone does not feel a kinsman-ship with someone else, you simply cannot force them to have one.

Nor do I want to. But kinsmanship is dependent on many things. Not only the way things are, but they way people want things to be. A common goal centered on the narrative of [European values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europeanism). Nobody is forcing anything against your will, and AFAIK, you still have the option to leave the EU if you so wish.

But you have to realize something, this whole shebang is not about shared culture, language or any other nonsense like this. This is about making a small calculation and coming to the conclusion that it's more profitable to do things together then apart.

You've failed completely to see the benefits of a European Union, and instead focus on domestic issues, like unemployment, and debt that the EU has come to symbolise, supposedly epitomise, and has 'apparently' caused.
Europe is being used by the semi-jingoistic UKIP-esque Tories as a scape goat to ensure reelection; find a common enemy, and pin everything on it. 

Also, how exactly the EU stifles creativity is beyond me? 

Although I recognise that it is far from being the pinnacle of democracy, but with large pan-national organisation, something has to give. Look at Nato, the UN, even the States.

The EU has become another 'foreign' body that is supposedly siphoning sovereignty, how exactly would the EU function otherwise were it not for some relinquishment? (The UK knew this was going to happen entering into the Union and it's a tad late in the day to be complaining now)
It happened with the ECHR Human Rights Act, and now the EU.

As for being disappointed in people not seeing the positive side, it would seem your main reason for voting for is that you don't want to see Britain lose its membership of the boy's club. Going along with Europe simply for the sake of not standing in the way of progress is a poor enough reason.

To the people saying that it's an island mentality, I don't agree that's the case. In a union as big as Europe, with so many people, languages, cultures and traditions, sharing a land border really isn't enough to keep people sharing a viewpoint.

Cioè, stiamo parlando di uno che se non passerà alla storia come il peggior magistrato di sempre (citofonare Scarantino e Ciancimino) è solo perché esiste uno che si chiama Luigi De Magistris. E di uno che, nonostante ciò, è riuscito a costruirsi un credito politico enorme sull'immagine del magistrato coraggioso e democratico. La velocità con cui i suoi debitori si sono ritrovati alla canna del gas è stata allo stesso tempo la sua fortuna e la sua rovina. Fortuna perché si è fatto dare carta bianca, rovina perché i tempi si sono accelerati. Il motivo vero del famoso incarico in Guatemala era mettere del tempo tra l'Ingroia giudice in Sicilia e l'Ingroia candidato in Sicilia onde aggirare [la legge](http://www.riforme.net/leggi/testo-unico-leggi-elettorali.htm) che impedisce ai magistrati di candidarsi dove hanno esercitato meno di sei mesi prima; solo che i tempi del solido processo sulla trattativa Stato-mafia a quel punto non tornavano più, e l'ultimo atto firmato da Ingroia come procuratore in quel processo risale a due mesi fa (per la cronaca: Ingroia si candida comunque capolista in Sicilia spiegando che siccome è ineleggibile comunque opterà per un altro collegio. Questo sempre perché lui è quello della legalità).

Il problema vero però è che il fattore tempo incide in maniera decisiva su due aspetti molto più importanti, che per semplicità chiameremo programma e candidature.

* Programma - Ingroia di politica non capisce un cazzo. Il che, per uno che fa un altro lavoro, è anche normale. Solo che se decidi di improvvisarti statista un minimo di preparazione devi dartela, e per questo ti serve tempo. Lui non solo ha avuto poco tempo, ma intorno ha uno staff di pochissimo spessore. Risultato: per ora è un candidato politicamente debolissimo che ogni volta che parla fa figure di merda (l'altro giorno gli hanno chiesto che voleva fare per il debito pubblico e lui ha risposto che basterebbe sequestrare i beni ai mafiosi) e quando tratta con gli altri partiti fa i danni (vedi il casino che stava per combinare con la storia della desistenza)

* Candidature - Va bene che le si è dovute fare alla garibaldina, ma le liste di Ingroia sono raccapriccianti: un terzo dei posti a Di Pietro che ci mette i soldi, un terzo al trio Ferrero-Diliberto-Bonelli (con i quali va in vacca l'unica cosa bella uscita dalle elezioni del 2008 e tornano d'attualità cascature di palle tipo [""Candidato comunista dice bene delle Br, polemiche""](http://bologna.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/01/20/news/funerali_del_br_gallinari_bufera_su_rifondazione-50935120/) e non è che se ne sentisse la mancanza) e un terzo a una serie di figurine della celebre società civile

Quanto a bacino elettorale, pesca nelle zone di disagio. Tolta la Campania dove incide anche un segmento di clientela di De Magistris, l'elettorato di Ingroia è diviso tra provenienza Vendola (voglio una sinistra ma un po' più dura e pura, proprio come me) e provenienza Grillo (voglio un anti-sistema ma un po' più istituzionale, proprio come me).

Well I disagree. It doesn’t matter if it is 100 or 60,000. If one wish to live together one should show and practice interest for the other part. Learning something about the language could be a pretty forceful sign of commitment, but as I wrote it could also be other things like learning of history, culture, visiting, etc. All Danish schools ought at least once during the school period to arrange a class visit to one of the other areas of the kingdom. The same I expect of English/Scottish/Wales schools.

&gt; But there is, that just doesn't revolve around nearly dead languages. One has to be practical about these sorts of things.

I guess the people speaking Gaelic don’t think it is nearly dead. Certainly the people speaking Faroese and Greenlandic do not. Practical is overrated anyway. You can’t build a nation on being practical.

&gt; Well, there is the fact that Denmark has been subsidising their entire existence since forever.

And it always comes back to this. But if the only connection is some grudge against sending subsidies, then nothing will hold it together if those subsidies turn out to become no longer needed. Anyway it’s an old discussion of who has benefitted the most from the arrangement.

It is a scandal in Denmark, and that if has anything to do with us is irrelevant. It has made people question on several occasions if Greenland having autonomy is a good idea for the kingdom.

&gt;There’s not likely going to be a big problem with the Chinese leaving after completing the work. There are experiences with similar projects in Iceland and other places. The Chinese workers are not being exploited as they get more than what they could earn in China.

They are essentially being exploited because the pay for the average Chinese worker is so low. Compared to a normal worker in Denmark or Greenland then there is no doubt about it. It is all about saving a little extra money. 

&gt; In any case, it is a process that has been ongoing for years. If Denmark wanted it could have made some serious attempt to finance and provide the workers for extracting the resources themselves. No such attempt has been made. In fact Denmark and Danish companies have been remarkable absent. Consequentially one much conclude that Denmark is not very interested.

There is no doubt about it, Denmark has been asleep at the wheel, but people are waking up and going ""What the hell Greenland? I thought we were pals."" And it is not exclusively Denmark either, the rest of Scandinavia has also woken up to this.

&gt;I have previously and will still argue for transforming Denmark into a confederacy of the three nations: Denmark, Greenland, and Faroe Islands.

There are many things I love about Europe, and I don't mean to talk down about it (should I prepare for an avalanche of downvotes?) but I can tell you that Canada DOES NOT share most european values, and certainly doesn't share European culture. 

Yes, we still have strong ties to the British Monarchy obviously, and the country was founded mainly by the French and [Scots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Canadian) (not so much the English, as is a common misconception), and yes, as a multicultural community, our country has the greatest cultural diversity in the world - which obviously includes all European nations. 

But, generally speaking, we are not bigoted and prejudiced the way Europeans are (I truly mean that in the softest possible way - I'm just stating fact).

In Europe, you are defined by your nationality. Oh - you're German? You're like this - i don't need to know anything else about you. You're French? You're like this - i don't need to know anything else about you. They Belgians are all like this - the Eastern Europeans are all like that (The more west in Europe you go, people can't even tell the difference between Eastern European states - Hungary? Meh - it's the same as Poland right?).

What uniting values are you talking about? That we have socialized medicine? whoopdi do. so does almost every other country in the world, with the high-profile exception of the US. That doesn't make us European. 

Canada is an independent, resource-rich (with the world's second or third highest oil reserves in the world after Venezuala and Saudi Arabia depending on how you calculate it - and we're not part of OPEC, so we can produce as much as we want. We have the world's biggest fresh water reserve if you include ice, we have the world's largest lumber reserves, and on and on with minerals and fisheries, etc etc.) 

WHY ON EARTH would we join the EU?!?!?!  Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Monaco... These are all rich countries that would be retarded to join the EU too. They get all the benefits with none of the headaches.  THAT is the direction Canada is goig. We are aggressively pursuing [Free-Trade with EU](http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2012/09/12a.aspx?view=d) so we can profit even more from our resources, and not be burdened by your ridiculously impotent parliament (seriously - who was the genius who thought that getting almost three dozen historically proud and nationalist countries - all of whom base their national identities at least partly on one or more of the many wars they've had against the same countries they currently share a table with - was a good idea?)

I chuckled at the ""I see no reason to exclude nations"" comment. How typically British (Ironically - in an EU thread).

This is also a super local place, you will only find Italians here and a few American students, but definitely NO tourists. If you want to more local things, try out the outdoor market around San Lorenzo (the old cathedral mentioned earlier). It has a ton of cool leather items (Florence is known for their leather). Also, a super cool place to eat and try local food is the Mercato Centrale, which is right next to the San Lorenzo. It is a super local place and has the best beef sandwich I have ever had, EVER. My favorite Gelateria in Florence is Gelateria di Neri, on Via di Neri (avoid all of the gelaterias near the Duomo with the huge stacks of gelato, they are all fake and overprices). I hope some of this helps, and enjoy Florence, I studied here for a year and it is one of my favorite cities in Europe.

If you really want to get in on the Italian social scene (and save a little money on food), you should find a local bar and go to aperitivo. When you get aperitivo, you go to a bar and order a drink (this will usually cost around 5-8 euro if you go to chill local place) and this will get you access to what is essentially an unlimited appetizer and pasta buffet, and could definitely fill you up enough to count as dinner, and it is a cool way to experience Italian culture.

En France un chercheur n'a que un ou deux thésard à la fois et la thèse est en trois ans (en science en tout cas), après le master. Par comparaison aux états unis, c'est courant d'avoir 6 ou 7 thésard et la thèse inclus la période master, ce qui fait des thèses qui dure entre 5 et 7 ans. bref, comme on dit, c'est les fermes à thésard.

Je suis moins au courant pour les post-doc (les cdd de chercheur) mais je sais que sur une bourse ANR, le temps du contrat post doc ne peut représenter qu'une fraction du temps dévoué par le personnel déjà engagé.

There is a cowardly culture in terms of business - entrepreneurs only follow routes previously taken by others. In fact when I tried to create a new enterprise, I faced problems with the tax office because there was no recognised code for it on ""the list"".

I will give you another example. To run a taxi here you have to buy a license from another taxi operator. This costs EUR200,000 around here!! As a consequence there is one taxi within 200 sq km. This is like an ambulance - you literally have to be sick to be able to afford it. Therefore there is effectively no taxis, so rural restaurants lose business, old people do not visit shops, young people cannot go to towns. 

This is all to protect the existing taxi owner. But the result is that there is no culture of taking a taxi, so even he does not do well.

So? They're both controlled by the Parliament, and the review by the EP is not a formality: candidates for the commission can and are refused and replaced.

&gt;Question: How do I vote out a Commissioner? Answer: I can't.

How do you vote out a minister in the UK? You can't, except by similar procedures

&gt;Question: Does the Commissioner appointed by the EU and my government represent my interests? Answer: No. He represents EU interests.

Do the UK ministers represent your interest? No, they represent UK interests.

&gt;So, we have an executive body, which is not directly elected by the populace and is not accountable directly to the populace. It's not even in his job description to represent my interests.

Your executives aren't directly elected either. And even so, does that matter? You don't elect your judges either, executives are to execute tasks. The parliament has to control them, it's much easier for the parliament to dispose of an incompetent unelected minister than someone who brings a lot of votes to his party.

&gt; This is why you get people like Peter Mandelson getting jobs as EU Commissioner. It's so unbelievably broken it makes me want to cry.

I like the idea of a unified Europe, but why do we have to make a dash for it? we got thousands of years more history in our wait, lots of time to work out the small differences that still divides us.

we are not like the US, a melting pot of cultural integration, Europeans have way to much history behind us to just let it merge together like they could over there.

for there to be a unified European 'federal' state I think is something that have to take a lot of time, we can't really integrate with each other well before we think of ourselves more as Europeans than from individual countries. and for that to happen I think it will take more than just another 50 years, I think we need to expend the scope to 300-500 years.

we are already working together well now, international conflicts are almost vanished from Europe, there are no great conflict over territory or religious or cultural differences as what have painted the picture of Europe for the last 1000 years, no need to rush headlong into a federal state that might spur it up again.

Just like in modern countries which have multiple spoken languages, street signs would be displayed in whichever language is dominant in that particular area, with dual or triple street signs in diffuse border areas.

Je n'ai pas pris la peine d'expliquer en quoi son ""argumentation"" était stupide, je pensais que la vidéo parlait d'elle-même mais si tu veux je peux parler de passages qui m'ont particulièrement fait marrer.

* 1er exemple : vers 1:30 Laurent Louis évoque l'Irak, l’Afghanistan, la Tunisie, l’Égypte, la Libye et parle de  reversement  de ""dirigeants légitimes"" et de ""régimes progressistes et modérés"". Je ne rentre pas dans le débat du bien fondé de ces renversements de régime (on pourra en discuter par ailleurs) je parle ici de son argumentation. Pour s'appuyer sur l'aspect légitime, progressiste et modéré des Kadhafi, Hussein, des Talibans etc... c'est que ce monsieur est idiot ou qu'il nous prend pour des idiots. Un homme politique intellectuellement honnête se serait contenté de l'argument qui arrive par la suite, c'est à dire, le remplacement de ces régimes par des régimes islamistes peu enviables.

* 2e exemple : vers 4:15, ce monsieur nous explique que le but de l'intervention des puissances occidentales dans ces pays musulmans est de faire tomber les régimes ""progressistes"" pour favoriser l'arrivée au pouvoir des islamistes afin de les faire tomber à leur tour pour s'approprier les richesses du pays.
Pour moi c'est complétement farfelu. Les puissances occidentales maitrisent très bien les ressources d'Afrique et du moyen orient via leurs multinationales de l'énergie. L'approvisionnement est assuré tant que ces pays sont stables (avec ou sans démocratie). 

Alors je veux bien admettre qu'on ne nous dit pas tout, que les grands médias nous livrent des versions officielles etc... mais quand même,l'argumentaire de Laurent Louis est à mon avis le fruit absurde des réflexions vaseuses de petits politiciens populistes dont le seul but est de faire parler d'eux.
Si j’étais d'accord avec lui, je serais énervé de voir mes idées décrédibilisées par ce flot d'idioties qui étouffent certains des arguments censés de ce monsieur.

Conservatives secured the opt outs and vetos with Maastricht.

I think so. If it fails like the Swedish one, the failure will be spectacular. Also, it is not like the FTT is super popular in all of the countries that is implementing it. I am not the German opposition, but if I were, I  would attack that tax like it was Satan coming to attack Germany, branding Merkel (Satan's pawn) irresponsible, hating the economy, sell- out to the south etc. They have an election coming up. 

Also, I have no problems seeing financial professors in France explaining again and again why it is stupid etc.

Also, even this time around they couldn't even get all the Euro countries to join in - if the tax fail, I don't see how they can convince them to jump *on* to the sinking ship. Honestly, you are not worthy of being a politician, either ruling who wants to score points and say no (who knows, he just might be a financial sensible one) or in opposition who will use the FTT again and again as an example of just how big loosers the government are. 


&gt;While I agree that it would be great for such experiments between willing countries to be conducted in the EU they have a tendency to become 'destiny', e.g. the Euro, Schnegen.

True, but I hope we have all learned from those. Naive, I know, but I do think in the case of the FTT at least, it doesn't have to go down the same road.

After all, I post and comment in lots of places including, /r/vegetraian (but I'm not a vegetarian), /r/communism, /r/socialism, /r/alltheleft, /r/conservative, /r/republican (but wouldn't define myself as any of those things..), I am involved in politics in the UK, live in the UK, which is part of Euorpe and also enjoy /r/worldnews... Plus lots of other subreddits.

&gt;Then an article that, in my opinion, has a negative angle on the entire European union, instead of this isolated case between Bulgaria/Romania (if I understood this article).

It's an interesting article and it raises some interesting issues.  Isn't that why we post stuff here? I wasn't aware one had to agree, support, like or otherwise have a positive position on what you post.  In fact I rather enjoy posting articles I disagree with because it spurs discussion.

&gt;It feels like its meant to shed union wide paranoia on a very small issue.

It may well do, but again, what has that got to do with *my* agenda? I also posted about the transaction tax and about some of the dafter aspects of eurosceptics in the UK.. About the only consistent aspect is that I tend to post things on Europe from a UK perspective, which as you know is mixed and tend to take a position in my comments that probably doesn't align with the general notion of -phile or -sceptic.

&gt;I see no reason why that would be different with the fisheries.

Because it can be managed to be sustainable, much like Iceland, Greenland and Norway do.

&gt;In particular because you will now have a big competitor next door,

Like Iceland, Greenland, Norway have, but it's just fine.  It's not even a competitor.  They could remove the caps and quotas, stop dumping, and the fish stocks would still be better off because there'd be a much smaller fleet working them, and the waste would drop dramatically.  If anything *that* competitor, which is already there because they're already competing with other fleets working their waters (and which have been more likely in the past to quota hop), suddenly becomes less competitive and the UK fleet far more dynamic.  It still comes down to selling catches.  The problem you're describing simply doesn't exist.

&gt;Never mind that trying to run a commons (the fish stocks) by means of private property rights results in a tragedy of the commons overnight. 

Not necessarily, the UK can implement its own regulations.  Ironically the CFP has been and is a real tragedy of the commons already.  Every country wanting to do what's best for them and not giving any ground has actually meant real reform hasn't been able to happen - and doesn't seem likely to happen in the foreseeable.

&gt;One of your own links specifically makes the point that user rights are not property rights.

The Greens, that criticise the CFP but advocate staying in the EU.  The point is that whilst their criticism of the CFP stands, by leaving the CFP territorial rights *would* come akin to property rights.  That's the point!

&gt;Anything that would improve the situation in the UK, can also be done in the EU.

Nice flip around of, 'anything that can be done in the EU can be done by the UK outside', your way however has been shown in 30 years of CFP that it isn't done, if it is at all possible.

Besides which, if it is a choice of both changes can happen both in or out (which I don't agree with and certainly the last 30yrs hasn't shown that), it remains that it would still be cheaper, less wasteful and more sustainable out, for the simple fact the UK wouldn't have to be a net contributor and would have to share.

As it is the statement is factually wrong:  outside of the CFP the UK can stop foreign fishing fleets from moving in.  As part of the CFP, it can't - by definition it wouldn't then be a common fisheries policy.  It's the exact antithesis!!!

Il M5S non è centralizzato, tranne che nelle procedure di autenticazione e verifica della fedina penale dei candidati.

Se non dai ai giovani/inesperti nessuna chance perchè sono giovani e inesperti sai che succede? succede l'Italia, governata da 30 anni dalle stesse persone che invecchiano sempre più ma non muoiono mai. In altri paesi democratici un giovane politico ha 25 anni, non 37 come Renzi, che in Italia rappresenta il ""nuovo"", il ""giovane"" (LOL). In altri paesi i leader politici dopo un paio di lustri al vertice si ritirano dalla competizione politica e vanno a fare altre cose, grazie al ricambio interno nel loro partito, invece in Italia gira e rigira vedi sempre le stesse facce da 20 anni e perchè qualcuno scompaia deve venirgli un ictus (e non basta neanche). Anche il centrosinistra che di nome ha cambiato leader un tot di volte nell'ultimo decennio alla fine è sempre controllato dai soliti due o tre (e Bersani non è uno di questi).

Io sono dell'opinione che all'Italia non serva un geniale statista o una compagine di gente preparata. Credo che serva che la politica e il suo intorno la smetta di mangiare a sbafo, perchè non è solo uno spreco di soldi diretto: è un meccanismo che mette fuorigioco le aziende competitive, che distrugge la meritocrazia nei fatti, che genera diseguaglianza. Altro che fare leggi per favorire la competitività e la meritocrazia: per creare migliori condizioni basta che l'apparato pubblico si muova con TOTALE trasparenza, che chi governa sia SEMPRE sotto i riflettori, che gli organi di stampa siano IMPIETOSI nei confronti dei politici tutti.

Il problema non sono i politici in sè. I politici sono come batteri patogeni, prosperano solo dove non c'è igiene. Se tieni pulito lo Stato i batteri non prosperano.

I'm alright with all of that.  Deal.

The UK at a minimum could contribute more to its own areas of rural development from the savings, lower food costs, introduce a sustainable fishing policy and saving an industry, create free trade agreements like Switizerland has done on its own with the likes of Canada, and pay an awful lot less for the privilege, with only overseas regulations applicable to the single market and some employment law which the UK would be allowed to *interpret* themselves.   DEAL.  Definitely deal.

As it stands, as this is just the fall back position I'm extremely confident that once the protests have been lodged of the UK not playing fair and tempers have run their course, the UK will get a negotiated EU deal where it remains in the EU as a net contributor but with far more scope and flexibility.  If they want a Federal government, and after the UK has passed the 2011 European Union Act, it's the only way they're going to get it - and there is nothing the EU can do about it.  

They can have it, and the UK won't step in their way again.  They'll never have to worry about another UK veto outside of the single market.  The price is the UK gets to architect a second tier EU.  The thing is, the EU has no choice.  Things stay with the status quo with the UK vetoing and opting out of power grabs and federalism, effectively creating a second tier by default - or an EU concedes they've been legally and morally out manoeuvred.

It can, but will it? No reason to assume either. In fact, all of these and the EU are already shifting blame to each other for overfishing.

And unrestricted competition for private benefit on common ground **will** result in a tragedy of the commons.

But will it?

&gt;Ironically the CFP has been and is a real tragedy of the commons already. Every country wanting to do what's best for them and not giving any ground has actually meant real reform hasn't been able to happen - and doesn't seem likely to happen in the foreseeable.

I can say exactly the same of a separate UK policy.

Da persona di sinistra, la coalizione Bersani, Vendola, Tabacci è la più solida che si sia vista da tipo, sempre.  
Bersani non sarà carismatico e tra canzoni della Nannini, Giovanni 23 e i suoi tentativi di attrarre i voti dell'elettorato centrista piuttosto che quello di sinistra, il gap culturale che ci divide è enorme, però rimane un politico professionista alla guida di un grosso partito, nonchè una brava persona, e non vedo altri in questo momento in grado di guidare l'Italia fuori dalla crisi e allo stesso tempo tornare a parlare di diritti dei lavoratori, di giovani, di diritti civili e di europa.

Monti mi sta pure simpatico ma la sua proposta politica e la sua vicinanza al vaticano mi fanno paura, mentre Grillo ricerca e trova la stupidità e il suo recente approdare a posizioni fasciste (abolire i sindacati, casapound) non è che la diretta conseguenza del populismo di cui si ciba.

 Yes, territorial water will be maintained better as it is in the interest of everybody in that country.  The problem comes when there are cross interests from multiple countries.  The important fact is that it isn't being run properly now and nothing of dramatic change appears to be on the horizon.

&gt;And unrestricted competition for private benefit on common ground will result in a tragedy of the commons.

And nobody in the UK is arguing that there would be no regulation.  You're just making that up.   The point being it wouldn't be silly EU regulation which has been around for decades which leads to dumping perfectly fine catches back into the sea, dead.  They argue for their own quotas, banning ecologically harmful methods, and stopping the dumping of perfectly fine fish once it has been caught.

Of course the UK will implement its own regulations.  

You're being silly.  It regulates everything else.  They're even arguing for fresh regulation, that's part of their whole argument, regulation the CFP in 30 years hasn't been able to achieve and has even admitted itself isn't working but are struggling to change.

Potential poachers are easy, because they're poachers and they're now illegal.  The problem it is legal for foreign fishing to enter UK waters and much more difficult to identify which of them are following the rules.  It becomes eminently easier to monitor and regulate.

Fuck off, you 'lazy-argument' idiot.  Of course its perfectly rational to say that the Spanish fleet which more than doubled the scale of fishing in the UK being removed would help the fishes grow.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"I wrote a long message but it seems to have vanished somehow.

I wanted to point out that US Civil War wasn't purely over slavery - it was a string of long disagreements that dated back 50 years or more. USA had tried to fix it with patches for 50 years, before things finally escalated into war. Some of the background issues are very much akin to those EU is having today. 

You must remember that before the American Civil War USA was a very different place from the monolith it is today. It was called ""THESE United States"" (implying they were independent states with one president) and after the war ""THE United States"" (one country with one president). Even today, you can note how the meaning of the word ""state"" in USA closer relates to the old Roman use of the word ""province"", as opposed to European use of sovereign state. The thing is, at no point between 1790s (after turning USA from confederation into federation) and present day was any of the words switched (no public protest if there isn't anything simple to rally against). Similarly EU is still calling itself ""unique model in human history"" while it's the dictionary definition of confederation. 

Now, I have nothing against confederation per se -- I actually like the clear-cut word it is as opposed to ""unique model etc."" -- but avoidance of simple, well-understood words like this tells of lack of trust for the democratic model - and as such is a step toward civil war (but if we are to compare EU-timetable to that of USA, we probably have something like 50 years in front of us before the current situation becomes unbearable - hopefully I'm dead by then).

Not exactly. First, the state doesn't intervene at all, so it's just the employers and the unions - not that the unions are at all powerful in Switzerland, and second it's negotiated sector by sector, so some do not have a collective convention (literal translation from French, not sure if correct), though those who haven't got one are usually those where salaries are already high, so that's OK.

Se si tratta di un semplice copiaincolla, allora la redazione sfrutta lo sforzo degli altri per generare pageviews e, quindi, un introito. Se il giornalista impiega almeno una mezz'oretta per riassumere e contestualizzare correttamente la notizia senza ridurla in poltiglia, è già qualcosa in più. Non dico che bisogni sguinzagliare gli inviati per ogni notizia – nessuna redazione può concederselo, men che meno gli stagisti – ma ci vuole un minimo di manodopera per giustificare il giro di denaro.

Poi c'è il grosso problema del copyright, che viene quasi sempre trascurato dai giornalisti, i quali credono che tutto ciò che è su Internet sia di pubblico dominio. Pubblicare foto altrui senza recarne la fonte, soprattutto nei boxini morbosi che hanno ben poco di giornalistico/educativo, non è solo immorale, ma è pure un illecito.

Everything I have said is backed by history, and history has shown what the IMF did to South America and they are doing the same exact thing in Greece.

When the IMF loans Greece, a country in absolute economic downfall 100 billion euros with 7% interest rates(unheard of) and then forces Severe austerity(using a puppet government) to trigger a Great Depression . . that is the ultimate 1-2 punch of destroying a country at its foundation. 

There were better ways to go about it then doing that, because from my point of view that strategy is not helping, it is economic warfare.

When you also consider that it has been known for a while that Greece has potentially Trillions of Natural Gas waiting to be taken and the fact that Greece has been forced to ""fire-sale"" much of infrastructure things become more clearer as this is the EXACT same thing that the IMF did to South America.

Currently most people self-identify as Danish, German, Spanish or English long before or if they identify as European. The scope might even be too big. It is difficult (and maybe only a more direct democracy can help here) to trust a governing body that has to balance its decisions across all those interests, cultures and the like. But maybe an American style full federation is not the right way. I have always thought that there were a few scenarios through which one could organize a working European union, but none of them are similar to the models being pursued (also I am a systems engineer not a political scientist):

1) A Tiered solution with regions organized in close unions (utterly merging their governing into the union) who then in turn are a part of a total EU which just handles free trade and trade disputes.

2) Every nation in the European region is subdivided into 5-10 million large states which is each an independent voting area breaking up all the nations and making power blocks and voting equal and fair. These regions should not be locked but be flexible and there should be active and fully funded programs to achieve income and infrastructure parity across all the small regions. 


But then I am just an engineer and I have found that for systems to work they need to have a lot of communication but centralization just makes a single point of failure which becomes an increasingly big target (in terms of politics this also translates into corruption, nepotism, rampant bureaucracy and eventually dystopia for the weakest while an elite lives of the fat of the land richer than any noble or king in the old times).

We've been successful this far.

&gt;what does the common human wants from its goverment. good roads, schools, hospitals, police, firefighters, social security so basicly the thing we need every day. and this is already managed by local politicans and they know this best, because they live there.

Not all the power is held regionally or locally. I live in Porto and the things you're mentioning are mostly managed from Lisbon, and that doesn't mean the quality of the service is worse than what it is down there.

&gt;and why is the eu sometime so hated? because they regulate the size of cucumbers...

The way you're talking, it's as if we don't hate our national governments or our municipalities, it's as if only in the EU people make mistakes.

&gt; in my opinion there is no need to find a standard solution to every day problems and this should dealt with localy where the people can agree on something. so give regional areas more room to make this decision.

There's something called [principle of subsidiarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity) and it's already applied within the EU. The EU doesn't interfere with what's best left for the national or local governments, it only rules in matters which are relevant to the EU as a whole and that it's beneficial for us to act together.

&gt;and then there are topics that does not concern the most people in the eu on daily basis, perhaps research funding, military and foreign affairs. 

That's the only reason there's the EU, because we are better together, because like that we aren't steamrolled by the USA or any of the BRIC.

Il semble avoir beaucoup apprécié son séjour, donc ce sont sans doute de bons conseils :)

Si tu n'as jamais voyagé à l'étranger, le conseil le plus important je pense, c'est de faire l'effort de parler la langue locale (pas seulement en France). Au moins pour entamer le dialogue, les gens seront tout de suite plus ouverts et patients. Surtout qu'il en existe ici qui ne parlent pas un mot d'anglais.

[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/15z6d7/studying_abroad_in_france_for_11_months_what_do_i/c7r8a7t) is from an other american student who came here, though he stayed longer. He seems to have enjoyed his stay a lot so those might be sound advices :)

If you never went abroad, I think the most important advice is to try to speak the local language (this stand true everywhere). At least to start the dialogue, people will be much more open and patient. Not to mention, you will find peoples here who can't speak english at all.

This sentence illustrates the entire problem facing the French economy. The *existing* taxi operators, companies, employees in unions, pharmacists, farmers, winemakers and so on, are placing barriers to stop new entrants or competitors.


There is a multiplier effect from each start-up that is denied access to the markets. Imagine if more taxis started to operate, they would bring more tourists to the restaurants, which would stay open later, employing more locals. Or the other way round - if there was more restaurant licenses, they would create more clients for the taxis, etc etc.


I did not wish to start a debate about the relative merits of different methods of transport - I was demonstrating that there are artificial restrictions on enterprise here in France that could be removed, benefiting everyone, but we must overcome the fear and resistance among those who have already climbed the ladder and then removed it.

That was only done in one country - and only for trades done using local brokerage services. It seems almost inevitable that it would push trading offshore - which it did.

This is something that will be much more effective if everyone does it; sadly, they're not going to. Where did most of Sweden's trading go, when it went offshore when they tried it?

The City of London.

Who isn't signing up for this? Right - the UK, where the financial casinos make up about [10%](http://fullfact.org/factchecks/does_the_city_contribute_14_of_gdp-2397) of the GDP.

Everyone would be better off if everyone instituted the same Tobin tax at the same time. Revenues would stay about the same for everyone, except some of it would shift from banking back to the public purse. But, if everyone does it except one country, then that country benefits hugely - because trading and revenue shifts offshore, to them.

So, the UK government would be much better off with a Tobin tax, but they're also much better off if other people have one and they don't, because some trading will shift to London.

If the UK joined the tax, trading would probably just shift to New York; good luck getting the USA to sign up. And so on, eventually right down to places like the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Tuvalu, etc...

Don't get me wrong - I think a tobin tax would be great, for its own sake - but also because if we can get it to work without a global scale disaster to force us, then it shows that we can collectively solve these kinds of deadlocks - which would be a huge step forward for lots of other things too.",0,1358886782,null,0,false,0,c81ndvd,t3_1728uk,t1_c81ndvd,t1_c81lxh6,null,1431045523,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

What annoys me is when people claim to take pride in a country or culture that they clearly do not understand or have anything other than a superficial attachment to. I apologize for throwing this well-intentioned poster under the bus, but I think that thread from a few days ago about wanting to get a German heritage-themed tattoo is a good example. I cringed as soon as I saw it, because I had enough experience with Germany to know that, from a German perspective, that's a fucking awful idea and there's almost nothing you could tattoo on yourself that wouldn't make people think you're a Nazi. But stuff like that happens all the time here -- people blindly associate with a culture or country because their ancestry happens to trace back there, but in reality they have no association or awareness of what it actually means to be part of that culture or country. 

I do think it's important to view this sympathetically though.

You're right that there's not much we can do during wildfire season than standby for it, but we can predict the most affected areas and allocate resources. 

Furthermore, there is a lot of terrain preparation required, it is mandatory by law that every piece of land with an area larger than whatever value I can't recall right now must have the borders of every sub-area, er, ploughed (not quite but close) as to kill and bury every plant in it in order to prevent fire spreading.

There's also a lot of forest work that needs to be done. There is a lot of fire that does not happen because we have men working the entire year cleaning out woods.

So, please, I can somewhat agree with you that, individually, people living in the always winter lands can have a different mindset for work than us happy southerners ('Live to work' versus 'work to live'), and that because society is built by individuals, there can be a relation with latitude, or rather, climate, with society efficiency, but saying that wildfires don't actually require work while implying that winter does (and then saying it's predictable, which means it doesn't actually require planning, which also isn't true, I think) is just wrong, my cold-faced friend.",0,1358889478,null,0,1358889971,0,c81odzw,t3_171t23,t1_c81odzw,t1_c81ipcn,null,1431045997,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Private universities have tuition fees, but in my opinion they are not worth their money. 


What is a double bachelor degree? A programme where you can earn two bachelor degrees? AFAIK those do not exist.

&gt;There is an understandable preference in media organisations for some form of self-regulation as
opposed to regulation from outside, because of the ever-present danger of censorship interfering
with the democratic principle of the freedom of the press. The recently released Leveson report in
Great Britain, however, has offered overwhelming evidence as to the multiple ways in which this
“self-regulation” has not just been interpreted as “no regulation”, but has led to gross abuses of
journalistic privileges, the breaking of elementary ethical standards, and even activities subject to
the criminal code. That this should have happened in a country with such long democratic
traditions, and one that had been often cited as exemplary with regard to freedom of the press, is
clearly a blow to the prestige of media owners and to that of the journalistic profession.

Ok take another example - the flat-rate social charges for small businesses/autoentrepreneurs. Measures show that economic growth comes from small and medium businesses - car makers, airbus etc will only succeed by employing fewer and fewer humans. But this (flat rate social charges) creates a barrier that requires a business to make a significant amount in the first year just to pay its obligations.

true,tugasnake,PORT,Portugal,"&gt;Having kids that I cannot support is incredibly reckless.

Top priority in life is to remain alive, eventually children are required to keep at least a portion of yourself in circulation. It would be reckless to not have children, especially in an environment with such low birth rates. Europe needs more kids or otherwise our welfare states are going to collapse and when shit does hit the fan don't expect someone else's kid to pay for your retirement because they'll be hands full with their own parents, at best you'll get a miserable pension.This should act as enough of an incentive to have more children, just imagine how nice it will be to have your children and grandchildren looking after you in a house with a fireplace whilst outside all those who turned their backs against conservatism and embraced ultra-progressivism die a cold death alongside their degenerate ideology. You'll die thinking ""I had a good life and my kids will continue my lineage"", they? They'll die thinking ""I should have listened to tugasnake instead of downvoting him""....

&gt;Having kids that I cannot support

I'm sure you'll still find it easier to support them than someone from the 19th or previous centuries or an average Chinese citizen. Just giving your child the benefit of being born in the UK is a good start. Don't be too pessimistic about and if you ever have the change don't let it pass because you believe your not ready.

Do heed my tips. It's not everyday that I feel this nice to give away an elixir of knowledge for free, so consider yourself lucky!

true,Mareeena,SHOL,Schleswig-Holstein,"I disagree with Poebel! Do not put down Berlin!! I repeat do NOT put down Berlin! If you want to learn German, and the real culture of a German state, then I highly recommend against it!

I have some friends from Canada, the USA, and Britain who went to Berlin for 1+ years to learn German, to teach English in German, and their German is terrible because everyone would just talk to them in English immediately after hearing their accent. Of course there are tons of stuff to do there, but that's why it makes a great weekend or day trip destination. The culture in Berlin is also not that much different than any other big city, and definitely does not represent the real ""German"" culture. 

Now don't get me wrong I have lived a little while in Berlin (Prenzlauer Berg and Grünau) so I have experienced the city through and through, but I just do not think it is the best option if you really are interested in language learning and culture.

The other states I have lived in are: Schleswig-Holstein (grew up there), Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and Bavaria. I have also travelled to and spent time in all of the other states as well, so I am hoping I can help you with your choice.

So instead of Berlin, I would pick Hamburg or Bremen as a city state. They both have plenty of arts and culture things to see and do, but have a more ""German"" vibe to them.

Hamburg: 1.8 million people. Really beautiful city state, and way fewer international tourists than Berlin. Great transportation and night life. So if you are really interested in a city life but want to still have the opportunity to practice your German than this is definitely a better option than Berlin. Also there are tons of entertainment options, such as musicals that can keep your free time busy! There are also operas, theatres, festivals, art exhibitions, you name it.

Bremen: Another city state, but smaller than the other two (550,000 people). There are many places to just sit in the sun with your friends like the Osterdeich or the Bürgerpark. You can get around most of the city by foot as well. Despite being a small city, the ""Disco mile"" offers like 20 clubs to go to, and there are many mellower pubs and bars around the city too. There are also art halls and theatres here too!

Because in America, the health insurance works different... It isn't like here in Germany. In America, health insurance doesn't pay for anything until you (even AFTER making your monthly payments) pay a certain amount. We call that a deductible (selbstbeteiligung). Just like your car insurance, the higher you make the selbstbeteiligung, the cheaper your monthly payments are... You may have to pay 5000-10000 dollars out of pocket BEFORE insurance kicks in. Along with that, you have to pay X amount per doctor's visit, this can range from 20-50 dollars.

I also want to point out, that as others have said, I am referring to simply 'plain clothes' police. I am unsure which section of the police force they belong to.

However I again disagree with your 'if you are doing nothing wrong you have nothing to hide' attitude which seems to be a common in this sub. One can critique something without it effecting me personally. For example, I do not need to be the victim to stand up for the rights of a minority. In this case, I believe society overall loses through lack of trust. I will never again have a frank and open discussion with a stranger at a bar, and if this is the kind of attitude that persists in society then I believe we all lose.

The underhandedness which the police seem to run their operations may be a particularly Italian trait, I am not sure. But such ubiquitous deception is a new concept to me.

Also, on a more general point, why so many police? This country does not have a great reputation for the efficient running of the public service and I find it hard to imagine society would break down if there was a little bit of an 'efficiency drive'. 

From Wikipedia:
&gt;During 2005 in Italy, the number of active police officers from all agencies totaled 324,339, the highest number in the European Union both overall and per capita, twice the number of agents in the similarly sized United Kingdom.

This is a lot of people to employ and a lot of money to spend, especially to simply to keep foreign students like myself safe. I have personally always felt very safe walking around, even alone late at night. In fact I would say I feel safer here with these 'Moroccan' guys you talk about than with the largely intoxicated peoples I see out on weekends in Anglo-countries.

Rape Statistics per 100,000 in 2006

* US: 31.5

* NZ: 28.3

* UK: 25.6

* ITALY: 7.6


So either people in Italy are 3 to 4 times less likely to be raped or there is a lot under reporting. But with all these police, there must be a lot of time to investigate these very few crimes which get committed.

My gut feeling is that the police here are like in many places, self-serving. But here they are a product of a [corrupt society](http://www.transparency.org/cpi2012/results#myAnchor1) and a corrupt system that is broken. They resort to these tactics in such a wide spread manner because it is all they know. They were taught that this how you do your job.

true,skptic,null,null,"Sorry for the text bomb, but here is a great reasoned argument that spells out my concerns with your point a bit further. From [here](http://falkvinge.net/2012/07/19/debunking-the-dangerous-nothing-to-hide-nothing-to-fear/)


Every so often, you hear the argument “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear”, in order to justify increased and invasive surveillance. This argument is not only dangerous, but dishonest and cowardly, too.


There are at least four good reasons to reject this argument solidly and uncompromisingly: The rules may change, it’s not you who determine if you’re guilty, laws must be broken for society to progress, and privacy is a basic human need.


Let’s look at these in detail. They go from the less important and more obvious, to the less obvious and more important.


* One – The rules may change: Once the invasive surveillance is in place to enforce rules that you agree with, the ruleset that is being enforced could change in ways that you don’t agree with at all – but then, it is too late to protest the surveillance. For example, you may agree to cameras in every home to prevent domestic violence (“and domestic violence only”) – but the next day, a new political force in power could decide that homosexuality will again be illegal, and they will use the existing home cameras to enforce their new rules. Any surveillance must be regarded in terms of how it can be abused by a worse power than today’s.


* Two – It’s not you who determine if you have something to fear: You may consider yourself law-abidingly white as snow, and it won’t matter a bit. What does matter is whether you set off the red flags in the mostly-automated surveillance, where bureaucrats look at your life in microscopic detail through a long paper tube to search for patterns. When you stop your car at the main prostitution street for two hours every Friday night, the Social Services Authority will draw certain conclusions from that data point, and won’t care about the fact that you help your elderly grandmother – who lives there – with her weekly groceries. When you frequently stop at a certain bar on your way driving home from work, the Department of Driving Licenses will draw certain conclusions as to your eligibility for future driving licenses – regardless of the fact that you think they serve the world’s best reindeer meatballs in that bar, and never had had a single beer there. People will stop thinking in terms of what is legal, and start acting in self-censorship to avoid being red-flagged, out of pure self-preservation. (It doesn’t matter that somebody in the right might possibly and eventually be cleared – after having been investigated for six months, you will have lost both custody of your children, your job, and possibly your home.)
Two and a half – Point two assumes that the surveillance even has correct data, which it has been proven time and again to frequently not have.


* Three – Laws must be broken for society to progress: A society which can enforce all of its laws will stop dead in its tracks. The mindset of “rounding up criminals is good for society” is a very dangerous one, for in hindsight, it may turn out that the criminals were the ones in the moral right. Less than a human lifetime ago, if you were born a homosexual, you were criminal from birth. If today’s surveillance level had existed in the 1950s and 60s, the lobby groups for sexual equality could never have formed; it would have been just a matter of rounding up the organized criminals (“and who could possibly object to fighting organized crime?”). If today’s surveillance level had existed in the 1950s and 60s, homosexuality would still be illegal and homosexual people would be criminals by birth. It is an absolute necessity to be able to break unjust laws for society to progress and question its own values, in order to learn from mistakes and move on as a society.


* Four – Privacy is a basic human need: Implying that only the dishonest people have need of any privacy ignores a basic property of the human psyche, and sends a creepy message of strong discomfort. We have a fundamental need for privacy. I lock the door when I go to the men’s room, despite the fact that nothing secret happens in there: I just want to keep that activity to myself, I have a fundamental need to do so, and any society must respect that fundamental need for privacy. In every society that doesn’t, citizens have responded with subterfuge and created their own private areas out of reach of the governmental surveillance, not because they are criminal, but because doing so is a fundamental human need.",0,1358897451,null,0,false,0,c81raiq,t3_16rr1o,t1_c81raiq,t1_c81r23f,null,1431047364,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

The court of auditors finds errors somewhere in the range of 2-5%, and arbitrarily sets a target of 2% to be ""signed off"". 0.2% is considered to be fraud, the rest errors and misunderstanding. The fact that it is not rubber stamped through is a *good* thing. What is the level of spending errors in your country?

&gt;Cameron's proposal for a moderate decrease in funding last year...

The funding is done on a seven year basis, with 2007-2013 being 975.777bn. This was an increase on the previous term, which meant that the spending increased year on year from 2007 to 2013. In 2007 the spending was 124.457bn, and in 2013 it was 152.502bn. These are the *adjusted* figures.

If Cameron wanted a real terms freeze in spending, *based on the seven year budget*, it would mean average year on year spending of 139.397bn. This is a cut of 13.1bn, which is ~8.6%. That is not a moderate decrease at all, which is why they weren't happy about it.

Having that said, I never mentioned whether I think other countries besides Greece are desperate or not. Of course they are. And they all buy the same bullshit the IMF, the ECB and the EU are selling to Greece (and Portugal). In fact, the USA is desperate, the FED is doing what Draghi couldn't even dream of.

If by lazy you also mean the banks that couldn't be bothered to fix their shit, and do not mean the hardworking people that expect various institutions to treat them with dignity (healthcare, education, justice, etc.) then I agree with you. There's plenty of those people sucking the government's tit in Portugal. They're big friends with the various governments since Portugal's fascist days even and in the last 25 years, the distinction between governments here is meaningless. We've been ruled by the governments' friends who are really all the same. If those are the type of people you're calling lazy, then I agree with you even more. I'm sure Greece has a similar problem. Governments that cater to these lazy people are obviously desperate. They have no political sensibility or consciousness, they jsut follow the herd. Their vision of society is so dark and blurry they couldn't even see Enlightenment if it hit them in the face.

In 1956 Guy Mollet, the French prime minister, proposed uniting Britain and France as a single state. British PM Anthony Eden wasn't keen on that idea, but they actually almost came to an agreement on France entering the Commonwealth, making Queen Elizabeth the head of state of France, and sharing a common citizenship.

oh, almost forgot: get some fresh air from time to time, or else the air is literally hitting you with a brick once you get out of the bar with an air humidity of 99% and full of smokers.

btw and OT: the only stereotype i think of when combining the terms ""alcohol"" and ""American"" is ""OMG i'm 21 (18?!) now, i'll party so hard and i am going to drink so much, these will be the best days of my life!"" :D

what i am trying to say is, one should have a healthy relationship to alcohol, if you know what i mean (not implying you don't have one). if i had a 13 or 14yo child, i wouldn't mind if he/she opened a beer when we're having a barbecue in summer or something. since i could not prevent them from drinking anyways, i'd try to teach them that it's okay when there are people around them who care and keep an eye on them, so they know what it feels like and still keep them safe.

also, sorry for my bad english, German here ;)
