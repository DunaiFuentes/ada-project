true,Bridgeru,IREL,Ireland,"You know, I agree a lot. The trouble I see is that so many people believe that the teenage demographic in Ireland is culturally Irish, whereas in my experience it's far from the case. As a few examples: My crush knows more Japanese than Irish (poor thing has the LC this year, -VERY- smart but Irish is the only pass subject), a girl I know who again is quite intellectual is fluent in Cherokee (!) but failed her Irish LC, and not to mention the various American/English influenced teenagers who I meet every day. 

The trouble is that to be a teenager in Ireland does not mean to be culturally Irish. And having Irish forced upon in schools is a very poor way of keeping the language alive, since those learning it will barely use it and most likely will associate it with a sense of resentment. Myothercarisawhale said that to stop printing in one language is to cut off one culture, but to force Irish onto the Irish teenage demographic who aren't entirely culturally Irish is to cut them off as well, leading to a major... Disconnect with the country in a day-to-day standard.

Also, might I add that, realistically speaking, there hasn't been anything Irish made (especially in the Irish Language) in recent years to draw the Teenage demographic into learning about Irish culture. Book of Kells, maybe, but that's it.

[die Welt noch dreht]: should be ""sich die Welt noch dreht"" and would be ok. I would prefer something like ""dass sich die Welt weiterdreht"". I think, this is actually being used. Of course, there are a thousand ways to represent this sentiment, but this one is definitely ok.

[über]: Again, there is a couple of ways to express this. I would prefer ""der wegen des Tests gestresst ist"". The Genitiv here might make it sound to proper, and colloquial German would say ""der wegen dem Test gestresst ist."". Don't write that for a German course, though.    
It would also work to use ""von"" here or perhaps even ""durch"".

[...Kaffehäuser]: They are mostly rather called Café in German, also because short and stuff. If you have to use the long form, add the second e for ""Kaffeehäuser"". Also, in such a general sentence, you shouldn't use the defined article, since it isn't defined which particular one you mean. You just in general don't like these places. So, better ""Ich gehe nicht in Cafés,"". ""Kein"" sounds weird in such general sentences, your version is much better.   
Also, consider dividing this sentences before the ""Aber"" into two, moving the ""aber"" then after the ""kann"".

[nur dafür zu sein]: That is the only example in this list, that doesn't work at all. If you want to use this particular construction, you are missing a couple of words ""nur dafür um dort sein zu können"". You can see, why this is not the likely wording...   
I would suggest to put a ""nur deshalb""/""nur darum""/""nur deswegen"" into the sentence to express shortly the ""just for that"" sentiment: ""und manchmal ist es wert nur deshalb dort zu sein.""   
Another way to say it is ""nur aus diesem Grund"". 

However, just a quick disclaimer: all these phrases are quite localized. A northern German will prefer other ways of saying it than a southern German, with a lot of different opinions in between the two. Therefore, a lot of things can be your right answer here.

I'm not busy right now, so I'll just give you some advice on the paragraph. I'll write all my corrections in bold! :) 

Während der Oster**ferien** (Ferien-vacation, and it works better in the context) werden Eier aufwändig verziert. Ein Osterei ist entweder ein hartgekochtes Ei, oder ein Ei das hohl ist. **Man benutzt einen** Griffel oder ein Stift, um heißes Wachs **in Mustern aufzutragen. Danach werden die Eier in Farbe getaucht.** Wenn das Wachs entfernt wird, ist das Muster intakt. In den slawisch geprägten Teilen Europas sind Ostereier eine sehr wichtig**e** Kunst. Die verzierten Ostereier sind Geschenke, oder sie **werden an** Ostereibäumen **auf**gehangen.

The Ferien-Urlaub thing is kind of hard to explain as they both translate to ""vacation"". ""Ferien"" is most often used to describe the time you get off work/school. ""Urlaub"" is more often used to say when you're going somewhere, and ""Urlaub"" is much harder to use right (""Während des Osterurlaubes...""). If you wanted to say ""holiday"", then saying ""Während der Osterfeiertage.."" would be a perfect fit. 

I had to change the wax-sentence a little because I wasn't sure what you wanted to say, but it still describes how the eggs are painted. :) 

Hope that helps :)

The ECB can not just ignore that laws that govern it, and I am actually astounded that people wants to completely ignore the law and just start printing. In order to do that, one has to renegotiate the ECB statues, and quite possible the Maastrich treaty. 

We have already seen what happens when the countries ignores the law, that is a big reason that the current situation is so bad. Doing it even more hardly helps, even if I can understand the reasoning behind.

Huh, it's really hard to explain but I'll try.

Serbian men age 45-60 are most fucked over people in Europe/maybe in the whole world.And I am really sad for them.

A lot of them were in at least one war or in some case two wars in the past 20 years(late and early 90s on ex-Yugoslavian land), served they country as much as one human being can, before and after that period of time worked their asses off in huge factories, made families and paid taxes &amp; everything to this country.

And what did they get in return?Nothing absolutely nothing.All factories and whole industry is sold to 1% and they live like kings while the others suffer like homeless dogs.Some of them commit suicide, become alcoholics or do some other stuff, and some even do things like this.

RIP all victims,

 but this guy didn't kill them, our politicians and tycoons in the past 20+ years did.They killed most of Serbia.

OK, so you are talking out of your ass? There's no mention of any other serious financial aid, other than very specific and relatively minor **military** aid Truman sent to Greece.

In fact, Greece and Turkey were just the first steps in the Marshall Plan, which would later set up substantial counterpart funds for Germany.

&gt;I agree with your assertion. And why shouldn't they have been treated more favourably than others? 

It's not about Germany being treated more favourably --of course, any denial of reparations to war-torn countries was just terrible, they had no funds to reconstruct-- it's about a Germany that had committed massive war crimes and aggressively emptied the banks of several nations being treated much more favourably than modern-day countries who have at worst been financially irresponsible.

As a result, austerity measures are pushed which for the most part have yet to show any substantial positive consequence, thus destabilizing, not only the markets, society and political balance of *one* country, but multiple. Additionally, this climate has outreaching effects towards the entirety of the world.

That is not to mention the cost of human life, massive decrease in quality of life, and revival of xenophobic feelings. Again, what did any of these countries do to deserve any of that?

Au final est-ce qu'il y a une différence fondamentale entre un éleve qui a fait classe prepa+ecole d'ingé et un éleve qui aurait fait IUT+ecole d'ingé?

I don't agree that permanent transfers and pooling debt is a definite solution, it is a good stop gap, but even if we did that, in the end the ECB would have to act like a lender of last resort for everything to work smoothly. It should also target NGDP and unemployment and not only inflation.

But, in order to get the Eurzone to work, it needs to be huge transfers and pooling of debt. How permanent is of course a question of how fast the south can become competitive, but a minumum of 20 years. I mean, that is what you need to do, to get the Eurozone to work (one of the things).

One thing that I would be extremely scared of if they changed the rules, if I was a Eurozone citizen, is how they would use these new rules. 

As I see it, there is an enormous risk that the ECB would just end up like the previous central banks of Italy/Greece etc, printing money to cover up other stuff. So, essentially the Eurozone monetary policy would turn in to the monetary policy of southern Europe. 

And, if I think so, you can bet that not only does several other northern Europeans, but above all - the investors. And, then they will loose faith in the Euro, it will be used as the printing press for the south. 

So, how are they going to deal with that?

You and other Europeans may think that way. Certainly not investors. Any investor would prefer to invest in countries where the central bank actually does its job. You have an example of that in the US, Japan and UK.  
  
On the other hand, each time the ECB actually does its job, like when it said it would do whatever it was needed, and that it would buy bonds in the secondary market - the only thing that actually helped in this crisis by the way - austerity proponents take the corresponding interest rate decrease as proof that austerity is working so they insist extra hard in it.

&gt; Certainly not investors. Any investor would prefer to invest in countries where the central bank actually does its job.

Investors like stability above all. Knowing it will be the printing press for the south, is not a stability. The Italian economy is going down again - let us just print some more money instead of dealing with the problem. They have tried that - what happened then?  

How do you think the north will feel with a permanent interest rate of 5 %? 7 %? 


And, above all, the treaty has to be renegotiated. I think a lot of people would have the same fears and thought as me, so it is not very likely to happen. 


&gt;On the other hand, each time the ECB actually does its job, like when it said it would do whatever it was needed, and that it would buy bonds in the secondary market - the only thing that actually helped in this crisis by the way - austerity proponents take the corresponding interest rate decrease as proof that austerity is working so they insist extra hard in it. So Europe may be too idiot for shared central banking.


I certainly agree that it is moronic leadership, but the ECB does not exists in a vaccum. If the EZ countries want a working union, they should sit down and rewrite and renegotiate the Maastricht treaty. If they for example pooled all the debt and had huge permanent transfers, the relief in form of printing wouldn't be so tempting. 

Also, people would have a chance to vote about it. Right now there is an enormous democratic deficit.

""Imigrantes ilegais"" is what is used for illegal immigrants, but again there has been for some time a policy of not using this in relation with, say, crime reporting.

Additionally, ""imigrantes de leste"" is used for just about anyone coming from what used to be the Iron Curtain; there is less concern with this by the way, European immigrants are most likely to be called ""imigrantes de..."" than anyone from Africa, I suppose because there is a whole different stigma attached. More recently Brazilians (mostly from the NW) also compose a good part of economic migrants; they are referred to by nationality, but again it is generally not reported by the media. Gipsies are called ""de etnia cigana"" (""of gipsy ethnicity"") - I'm translating as it is used here, we do not have the term ""Roma"" associated with gipsies and using it would make people think of Italy. This raises a different issue (similar to the African communities) which is the difference between nationality and perceived ethnicity.

Those who are under asylum have a different classification, mostly because there aren't that many and their status is considered relevant, sou ""exilado polico"" or ""exilado humanitário"" are used.

Recently the leader of the communist-oriented labour union (the largest) called the ethiopian IMF guy ""escurinho"" (darky), which raised some comments (real concern, some thought it was funny, others that it was a metaphor, etc). The closest word for ""coloured"" is ""pessoa de cor"" (lit. ""person of colour""), it's seen as a non-offensive way to refer the externally visible ethnicity, in a way;  most people just use a liberal classification of ""black"", most media use ""african descent"" if they really need to. Those from India, South America, etc. have different popular classifications, but again this ones are not used in the media since they are considered offensive (and mostly are).

Above all:

&gt;I think it's something interesting to look at because, in a way, it reflects the opinions of the people of the country.

I don't think so. Most of these are ""from above"". When talking with the ""people of the country"" everything I said above is mostly thrown out the window and much more direct terms are employed. The comment section of online newspapers is rather a good example of this (although, like in youtube, it's mostly filled with idiots). The concern with terms considered loaded comes from above and actually derives partially from EU directives I think.

true,Kit_Emmuorto,ITAL,Italy,"Italy reporting in (also, I happen to work in the news so the account is kind of first hand).

First of all, a major news agency named AdnKronos just decided a few weeks ago to stop using the term ""illegal immigrant"" as well (which in italian is simply ""clandestino"") for the same reasons involving political correctness cited by AP. Quite a dumb move if you ask me, but still.

Thus said, looking at how italian media deal with immigration is a good way to understand how fucked up is the whole media situation. The scheme is easy: right wing media says immigrants are bad no matter what, while left wing media will state the exact opposite. This happens for a very simple reason: people who put money in right wing media hold a negative prejudice about immigrants, so the media tells them what they want to be told (examples: massive emphasis on the crimes committed by immigrants, statistics about how much immigrants took er jerbs and stuff), while people who put money in left wing media hold a positive prejudice about immigrants, so the media tells them what they want to be told (examples: uplifting stories about integration, praises of multiculturalism and stuff).

Since political correctness plays a huge role in all that (and since you do not want to steer from the path of political correctness because nothing pisses off the public more than somebody daring to challenge the general consensus on such matters) every time the media get to talk about the subject, huge drama ensues. The latest example is from a few days ago. Since the financial crisis is hitting hard and many people are unemployed, two out of three of the major unions suggested we stop allowing immigrants to come here and work the fields and start giving those jobs to unemployed italian. The main leftist political party strongly disagreed with the suggestion (which is quite of a huge deal, since said party and said unions have always been more than collateral). Right wing media are siding with the proposal, while left wing media are opposing it. Grat debate, zero utility. 

So, no big surprise: the media deal with immigration using the same hypocrisy and the same tongue-in-cheek attitude towards the readers which are used to deal with every other subject. People are fine with it and, depending on what their opinion on the subject is, put money in certain media believing them to be the only ones telling the truth.

Because Americans saved their asses in 1995. That's why. Nothing else. Without Americans stopping our troops we would enter Banja Luka, we were 20 km from it and Serbs were already packing and rushing to the east.

Just as Americans helped with Oluja they also wanted to keep RS alive. 

If they allowed it, whole western part of RS would be liberated and there would be no RS ..... so, that's the historical reason.

But real reason is because they would join Serbia and Serbia would get new territories, thus ""winning"" the war and they don't want that either. While they didn't want maybe half a million Serb refugees, they also don't want Serbs ""winning"" anything.

Why? Maybe because it was Serb volunteers who were going into Croatia and Bosnia and not the other way around.

The two major indigenous minorities are the Turks (of which I am a member) and the Gipsies. Although things used to be pretty bad for the Turks in the 80s with a ban on language and culture, and a forced assimilation campaign, these days I can't complain much - the constitution grants us the right to freely practice our language and culture, although there are still the occasional accusations of acting as a fifth column and serving the interests of a foreign country, and there is also the nationalist party ATAKA that routinely picks up fights with turks to bolster its credentials with the nationalist segment of society. Things with Gipsies are quite different - they are routinely discriminated and marginalized due to stereotypes held about them - that they steal and they are up to no good. Such stereotypes are unfortunately held by both bulgarians and turks in the country.

Offensive ways to refer to gypsies are ""mangal""(мангал), some would even consider ""tsiganin""(циганин) to be offensive - so the politically correct term is ""roma"". 
Offensive terms used for turks range from ""gajal""(гаджал) to ""cut-dick""(рязан), referring to circumcision which is routinely practiced among bulgarian muslims. ",0,1365516978,null,0,1365517685,0,c9bl5yt,t3_1bzcr7,t1_c9bl5yt,t3_1bzcr7,null,1431620101,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Goes to show that being forced to be politically correct just destroys the vocabulary and helps very little. 

In France, Roma delinquents are called Romanians... even if their actual nationality wasn't clear.

The US has a huge internal market where everyone speaks the same language and there are areas like Silicon Valley where practically all of these big tech companies reside and exchange talent back and forth. Facebook is able to grow big in the US and _then_ expand to other countries, killing off the smaller national facebook alternatives through its market power and the network effect. We simply have no possibility of creating this kind of initial market expansion and tech infrastructure from scratch in Europe, unless we all speak the same language and share more culture and institutions - and had the first-mover advantages. Facebook won because it was the biggest, not because it was the best.

Rather than trying to beat the US which has the first-mover advantages (most of the consumer technology we use originated there after all), European countries are wisely focusing on other areas where we can obtain our own advantages. The Verge is focused on consumer technology so it is a bit myopic about these things.",0,1365518838,null,0,1365519421,0,c9blqka,t3_1bzjma,t1_c9blqka,t1_c9bkuqb,null,1431619831,27,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,27

true,Xuth,UKGB,United Kingdom,"A UK journalist here - I'll break it down from what I've been told and by reading through my old copy of the Guardian Style Guide on my desk.

Coloured is seen as a very old term - I tend to hear my grandfather use that one the most. It's the kind of thing you expect to hear from Tories with top hats, laughing about the good-old-empire days. 

Black is the media and official term ('Black British' is on the census). So you'll get stories about 'black youths' and 'black police officers' - there's actually an official union called the National Black Police Association for non-white officers to raise concerns of racial equality. They are also termed of 'Afro-Carribean origin' - but this comes across as sounding like something out of a police report and isn't used as commonly by the media (unless quoting a police report...).

**However** using it as a collective noun is frowned upon and not used by the media. So no referring to a group of black people as 'blacks'. This is considered demeaning. 

Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis - anyone from the subcontinent are refereed to as 'Asian' (again, this is a term from the UK census: British Asian). This also very-rarely spills over into people of Arabic, Persian and (with more American influence on the term) Far Eastern people. Although my editor wouldn't let us use the latter examples.

Although people from China, Japan and Korea tend to just be named for their country. 'Oriental' is going the same way as 'coloured' in feeling a bit dated. 

Tabloids tend to join Eastern Europeans together too. So you'll get stories about 'An Eastern European family' instead of the individual nation until later on in the story. Sometimes, if a story is trying to prove a point about eastern immigrants, it'll even use the 'Former Soviet Bloc'. 

Although if we're talking about immigrants in particular then the media has a tendency to collectivise all immigrants - referring to them en-masse as asylum seekers or 'an immigrant', 'the immigrants' etc. 

Gypsies are just called gypsies or commonly 'Travelers' by the media; unless they happen to know the individual sect. So Romany, Irish, English etc. People tend to use gyppo or pikey - apparently that's considered racist and the media certainly avoid it.

EDIT: The official list of what people 'should' be called is [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_ethnicity_in_the_United_Kingdom) however this has caused a load of controversy and now the government just lets people class themselves as what they want.

Add together all the European start ups and we're definitely comparable to America. And that means we're comparable to first place. Not a bad place to be, you can admit.

The only problem I can see is that a lot of the companies which look like they're going to get big get bought out by the already existing players like Google, Facebook, ect. This is always going to happen when there is a pre-established big boys crowd. All we need to do is get one or two big players who can easily buy out smaller, new companies and who're European.

true,DisregardMyPants,UNSA,United States,"&gt;I think a good point here is: how would the US be doing if we remove Silicon Valley from the equation? Can the rest of the US compete with Silicon Valley any better than Europe is able to? Europe as a whole is doing quite a decent job despite not having Silicon Valley and the huge integrated market, and maybe we shouldn't expect to do much better in this area.

I think the difference here is that Silicon Valley is a drain on everywhere else: A lot of the people there *aren't from California*. They go there specifically for the start-up scene. Without Silicon Valley they'd still be doing startups, just elsewhere.

I've been in the start up scene for quite a long time, and I haven't heard of a similar situation in Europe. People tend to start-up where they're located there.

Even beyond that, we have large start-up scenes elsewhere. Austin Texas is absolutely exploding. Florida is the center of all things ""health"" related. Utah has also been a strong hub as well.

true,eurocarquestion,null,null,"Car ownership is slightly lower, people can get away with not having a car for a lot longer too. I imagine the peak of getting your first car is not at the point where you get your first job but when you get your first child. Most of the cities grew in the pre-car era which means they are more pedestrian, have better public transport and there are fewer garages suitable for working on a car yourself due to density. But also the cities being set out in such a way means socialising is different, even if you had a car using it to impress people, like younger men do, is a strange idea. Similarly the concept of a designated driver would be pretty unfamiliar to people outside of smaller country towns.  

Just those factors alone would trim the car modding level down hugely compared to the US before we get on to anything like core differences in culture regarding wealth, rugged individualism or cost factors like taxes.  

Then there are car cultures that differ by country, because Europe is far far from unified. It's not gradients of difference like a USA. Travelling in the 27-soon-to-be-28 members you can get Texas-to-New York scale differences, and bigger scale, just crossing a border.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I'm not sure why we're comparing Eurozone debt to German GDP, though.

Just to show how massive it is, and how much it would be for the Germans. Also, if you compare it to the whole Eurozone's GDP, you have to take into account that not everyone is as solvent and good at paying off as the Germans.You can bet it will be shown like that when they debate the SPD :-). 

But honestly, I can not understand why the Germans are not more worried about the size of their debt. I would be, it is the highest they have. Why don't they want to pay it off, but just increase it? 

And, to be serious- to have a properly working currency union one need permanent transfers and pooling off debt, it is Economics 101. So, in that sense Steinbrück is right, the EZ need to pool its debt.

I can't see how that is not discussed more, I mean, he is right (even though I would vote no to that as well). Can't the Germans see the discreptancy - a working currency union without transfers and debt pooling between so different economies does not exist. 

&gt;And don't hold your breath about Germany leaving the Euro. 

I don't know if I am ""hoping"", but I personally think the Euro, in its current form, is doomed, and in that sense it might be better if it breaks up sooner than later, it is not becoming any easier. 

I am just wondering when the breaking point will be I guess.

&gt;^(The index is based on data from more than 50,000 startups around the world who are using the Startup Genome’s Startup Compass, an automated analyst in the cloud that helps businesses make better decisions via benchmarks and actionable recommendations.
(Note that the dataset is heavily skewed towards early stage startups, although it does include many later stage companies doing millions of dollars a year in revenue. The dataset contains extensive anonymized data on nearly all aspects of the Startups’ businesses, including finances, team, product, sales, marketing, business model, market and demographic &amp; psychographic information about the founders).
^(The first column in the index is the overall ranking, followed by 8 weighted component indexes that are the inputs to the overall ranking,.
The index isn’t perfect, but it is a robust 80% solution that will be optimized in future versions. Feedback is always welcome at feedback@startupcompass.co.
Here is how we define the eight weighted component indexes:
Startup Output Index: The startup output index represents the total activity of entrepreneurship in the region, controlling for population size and the maturity of startups in the region.
Funding Index: The funding index measures how active and how comprehensive the risk capital is in a startup ecosystem.
Company Performance Index: The Company Performance Index measures the total performance and performance potential of startups in a given startup ecosystem, taking into account variables such as revenue, job growth, and potential growth of companies in the startup ecosystem.
Mindset Index: The mindset index measures how well the population of founders in a given ecosystem thinks like a great entrepreneur, where a great entrepreneur is visionary, resilient, has a high appetite for risk, a strong work ethic and an ability to overcome the typical challenges startups face.
Trendsetter Index: The trendsetter index measures how quickly a startup ecosystem adopts new technologies, management processes, and business models. Where startup ecosystems that stay on the cutting edge are expected to perform better over time.
There’s a good chance the trendsetter index is a leading indicator of the future success of a Startup Ecosystem. The trendsetter score for example corroborates with the prevailing excitement expressed about the Berlin and Sydney Startup Ecosystems, while also aligning with the anecdotal evidence we have received about the conservative culture and slow pace of adaptation in the Chicago and Tel Aviv startup ecosystems.
Support Index: The support index measures the quality of the startup ecosystem’s support network, including the prevalence of mentorship, service providers and types of funding sources.
Talent Index: The talented index basically measures how talented the founders in a given startup ecosystem are, taking into account age, education, startup experience, industry domain expertise, ability to mitigate risk and previous startup success rate.
Differentiation Index: The differentiation index measures how different a startup ecosystem is to Silicon Valley, taking into account the demographics and what types of companies are started there.
Since Silicon Valley is the #1 ecosystem it is assumed that other ecosystems will perform better if they differentiate themselves from Silicon Valley and establish their own strengths.)

This is how the Oxford American Dictionary define venture capital 

&gt;venture capital
noun
capital invested in a project in which there is a substantial element of risk, typically a new or expanding business.

As to why Germans are not too worried about the debt?

The Merkel cabinet hasn't dabbled in fiscal policy much at all, and it's worked in some weird way.

Steinbrück, Gabriel and the SPD don't just know that you need a fiscal union to have a monetary union, they've gone a step further and claim that we're basically already in one because Germany is already indirectly liable through the existing mechanisms and ECB policy, or at least I remember reading something to that effect.

Well, they are right. It has to do with the banking system, and how you guarantee money. I have read that too, in several different places. One book that comes to mind that discussed that issue was the book ""Eurokrisen"" (the Euro crises) by a professor of Economics, Stefan de Vylders. Very good. Unfortunately I think it is only in Swedish. I do not remember the exact numbers, but the numbers are massive. As in, enormous, massive, superduper big.

&gt;They're afraid that, if they show any kind of 'mercy', the Greeks et al. will get back into the hammock and keep on doing what they did before which is what they think got them into this situation to begin with.

Only partly. Obviously, the Greek finances were shitty, they borrowed to much etc, but that is not the sole reason. 

The economics theory behind currency unions says that the prices will rise when they join a union, and since the productivity is lower, unemployment will be much higher. Also, it is not just to ""increase"" the productivity. Think of when DDR joined with BRD. Their productivity was lower  and the unemployment immediately rose to new heights. However, then it was offset by massive transfers from BRD to keep them at a minimum with health care, social benefits etc. Also, the former DDR people didn't have to worry about foreign debt or the banks, the BRD fixed that, together with massive investments. Now, think about Greece/Spain etc, they also have high unemployment, low productivity etc, but not really any transfers or investements, plus failing banks and large debts. It is like an accident slowly happening. 

Particular with Germany's background I always assumed I guess they would see this. 

Not that Greece's economy isn't shitty, but not every GIIPS country has fucked up as massively. A huge fault ( and why they will not be able to recover in decades) is the pure science behind. Think where DDR would have been without any transfers plus debt and failing banks...Not everything is down to them being corrupt and overspending.

Pour résumé :
Cette étude c'est concentrée sur les écoles d'ingé à recrutement mixte (90% des effectifs d'ingénieurs).
1-Les étudiants en classes prépa ont effectivement une meilleure capacité de travail
2-Cette capacité supérieur disparait lorsqu'ils arrivent en école d'ingé (BAC+3 et +4). Cela s'expliquerait à cause du monde de recrutement des élèves de prepa par concours. Seulement 10% finissent dans l'école d'ingé qu'ils voulaient. D'après les directeurs d'école d'ingé beaucoup arrivent ""sans savoir où ils vont mettre les pieds"", au contraire les DUT font un meilleur choix lorqu'ils poursuivent leur cursus en école d'ingé et sont donc plus motivé.
3-Les étudiant ayant fait prépa gagnent en moyenne 3.5% de plus.

I think it is totally understandable. In fact, one of the problems with the Eurocrisis is that it is easy to understand both sides, both the south and the north. 

However- while it might be understandable that you do not want to repeat it, it doesn't help one bit. 

The Germans have to make a deciscion, one way or another, that is what I mean. Economics says that this can not go on forever, so at some point you have to say no, completely, and let banks and countries fall, or actually give up your independence and pay off Greece's debt for the next thirty years.

[The declaration of the Truman Doctrine on 12 March 1947 inaugurated a series of aid programmes which by the summer of 1947 were mainly concentrated on Greece and Turkey. These programmes primarily provided military aid, although they also included a strong element of economic assistance. Prior to this the United States had been supporting Greece financially in an indirect way by means of huge US contributions to UNRRA.](http://books.google.de/books?id=zzCZ3duPMbcC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=1947+greece+aid+economic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hVVkUe38LOSz4ASstYDgBQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=1947%20greece%20aid%20economic&amp;f=false)  

[By the end of 1949 military aid alone to Greece amounted to $353.6 million. [...] Economic aid in the years 1948-52 was worth $976 million, about half of it being spent on economic reconstruction [...]. While other countries of this region received massive American aid in these years [...] Greece received by far the most per capita. Even during the civil war, economic aid was as important as military, because it thwarted the Communist aim of undermining the government's authority.](http://books.google.de/books?id=wT7BDiFC9dMC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=1947+greece+aid+economic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hVVkUe38LOSz4ASstYDgBQ&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1947%20greece%20aid%20economic&amp;f=false)

[In addition to military aid provided under the program Greece received civilian and reconstruction assistance under the initial appropriation of $400 million. The $225 million appropriated foor the fiscal year ending Junde 30, 1949 is limited entirely to military aid since these countries are eligible for economic aid under the European Recovery Program.](http://books.google.de/books?id=btjnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA21&amp;dq=1947+greece+aid+economic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hVVkUe38LOSz4ASstYDgBQ&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=1947%20greece%20aid%20economic&amp;f=false)

One because if it is a daily driver all of the money is where it matters in the drivetrain and suspension... all go no show. You won't see them going through populated areas all noise and aggression or racing down motorways in traffic. 

Example being a good friend of mine has a Nissan 350Z he pretty much daily drives it and with the exception of different wheels (to accommodate 315 wide rear tires) and a slightly more raspy exhaust you wouldn't pay it much attention... Which is how he likes it. It is pushing around 840hp. He won't waste petrol on anything that is not Italian or German and six figures.

The other part of the serious guys have cars but they are for weekends and tracks. They drive some boring daily diesel and save the modified car for the track where it really belongs. Again all go no show, not interested in attention from teenagers.

Real sustainable growth comes from allowing the market to operate as freely as possible without an heavy of government restrictions and taxes on top of it.

The difference between Europe's austerity and the USA's spending is that we're trading in short term pain for long term growth whereas they're avoiding to dealing with their issues and just kicking the can down the line. While they're engaged in an unsustainable fiscal and monetary policy, we're reducing government intervention in the economy to allow for a lower weight of the state over the private sector.

Around 25k explicitly + part of the Students 7k + part of the work immigration's 19k (it's been intentionally hollowed out to include immigrants who failed through other paths since 2010 thanks to MP/M) are from within the EU. 

The rest are pretty much third-world economic immigrants on average, which only the ""Convention Refugees"" at 4.6k have a Europe-wide recognized reason for being here, while the others are here on funky stuff our pro-immigration crowd made-up. The statistics of ""adoptees and relatives"" in that PDF is intentionally misleading as well, the year prior before they threw the two together the adoptees bit only accounted for around 200ish people. 

What's more worrying is that said third-worlders are unemployable. The average employment rate among all immigrants, returning swedes (roughly 8k emigration yearly) included, is around 7 years but this is because there are significant amounts, around [82% of our Somalis](http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=104&amp;artikel=2826741) as just one example, that never get a job at all.

Which has now led to the majority of our social security costs going to immigrants.

Finance Minister Borg [speculates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzzSBQa5Oj8) that if we included hidden costs it's above 60% though. 

Of course now MP has also got their way through M and decided illegals should get free schooling, college recently included, and more inclusive healthcare without the police being allowed to involve themselves in what happens afterwards.

I am an American living in Italy. I have an iPhone 4 that I originally bought while in the states with AT&amp;T. Don't make the same mistake I did and purchase a factory locked iPhone. It was a real disaster when I first came over and it stayed an expensive paperweight for over a year. Anyway, I know they sell unlocked smartphones now, but that should be your number one concern when making the purchase. 
For the service, I have used multiple carriers over here, including 3 and Vodafone, but the plan I have now with TIM is the best for money and service. They have a plan called TIM Young, which you would qualify for if you are under 25. I hope they still offer it, but if not,they always have some kind of special going on.  Cell phone service providers over here don't rob you blind like in the states, so I think you will be pleasantly surprised with how reasonable the prices are.

The only people I've ever seen who do this are lowlifes.

Therefore, choosing to participate implicltly means choosing to present the impression to the broader public that one is a lowlife. This has a filtering effect.

In the USA there's more of an aspirational lowlife culture; many people — maybe becaue they have no other options, or maybe because the media told them to — work hard to be king of the local lowlifes, by imitating and outdoing each other.

For one reason or another that's restricted to a fairly small range of subcultures in most of Europe.

Many of my classmates tuned their cars when I was in high-school, usually GTIs and Japanese sport cars tuned on a budget. They didn't look that good. 

Then there are the people who actually make their cars a piece of art. One of my neighbors(almost neighbor) has a nice garage with tuned supercars(Porsche 997.2 GT3 RS tuned into a Cup(the track version)), and an Audi R8 with matte black wrap and aftermarket rims) and classic rally/racing cars(Warsteiner DTM E30 M3 replica, and Audi S2 ABT C5 replica). Those are tuned, but clearly no overkill and not done with a budget. They look splendid.

I believe the reason why there are less of lower end tuning cars is 1. cars are more expensive to A. Buy and B. Run. If you haven't noticed gas is almost double here than in the USA. 2. We have nice looking options, instead of tuning a cheap car I can go and buy an already stock tuned older Merc AMG or BMW M car for the same price.

* If you want to have a different tire measure that isn't on the registration papers implies a trip to the dealer to get a paper stating that the new tire measure is allowed (and you also have to pay for that) followed by a new trip to the DMV to re-licence the new tire measure.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"&gt; SO HOW YOU EXPLAIN ME WHY I SHOULD SEND YOU BILLIONS OF EUROS?

You personally are not going to send billions of euros. Let me explain basic maths to you. Suppose, for argument sake, the contribution from each citizen is ~25 euros...

Germany population: 82 million citizens

Italy population: 61 million citizens

Cyprus population: 850k citizens

Germany's total contribution: 2.05 billion euros

Italy's total contribution: 1.53 billion euros

Cyprus's total contribution: 21.25 million euros

I believe the figure for how much each country contributes to be based on the GDP (which scales in a very similar way to the population figure generally).

Long story short: you personally aren't going to contribute more than someone from Cyprus. In fact, quite a few countries end up paying more than Germany per citizen in the bailouts. I am not hearing Italians or Spaniards.. or French for that matter complaining about their contributions as much as other countries. You have the highest GDP and population.. your total number will always be the highest of all of them whether you like it or not -- at least understand why.

[This pie chart](http://i.imgur.com/1QJD2bO.png) should help you visualize the *total* contribution of each country -- yes, Germany is the largest part, but nowhere near the size your comments are trying to make it sound like it is.

It will be a fucking shithole. It will grow and maybe become a shit pile.

I mentioned the Constitution, you linked to the Treason Act. Of course the death penalty is ""way outdated"". That's why we stopped using it 59 years ago, removed it from the legislation 23 years ago, and slapped a constitutional ban on it for good measure 11 years ago. The Criminal Justice Act 1990 reads, in relevant part:

&gt;2.—A person convicted of treason or murder shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life.

&gt;[...]

&gt;4.—Where a person (other than a child or young person) is convicted of treason [...] the court—

&gt;(a) [...] shall in passing sentence specify as the minimum period of imprisonment to be served by that person a period of not less than forty years

As for the rest of your reply, I'm not sure of your point. Treason is defined in Article 39 of our Constitution as follows:

&gt;Treason shall consist only in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by this Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt.

Indeed, as it is defined in the Treason Act nothing done by the mentioned parties could be construed as treason. I'm saying that  contributing to drastically screwing up the countries financial situation to the point where it adversely affects the lives of everyone in the country while improving your own is tantamount to treason. Or, at least, in OP's old guy's and, I guess, my own opinion, it should be.

Failing that should we not have a new law drafted to make this an act of treason or invent a new word to properly describe it and then act upon it?

Btw, I'm not saying the guilty parties should be put to death =/ Just that justice certainly doesn't not seemed to have been served and ordinary people, such as OP's old guy, who worked hard for the betterment of the country are now bearing the brunt of it.

true,bbmm,null,null,"&gt;What I've heard from other Turks is that the problem is mainly what kind of Turks immigrate and from where they are.

This is probably studied and known by now.  But yes, most wouldn't have spent any time in Turkish cities and would react to a doubly alien culture.

&gt;Most of them are from villages and extremely religious and proud of their origins.

Ordinary folk piety can turn into 'extreme' organized, strictly-practiced religiosity after migration to Turkish cities too.  I think this is studied within the Turkish context too, but it would be different in Germany.  The difference is that in Turkish cities the 'other' folks be they bosses or [formerly strictly secular] teachers are clearly Turkish too and speak the same language.  Until the past few decades it did work OK in Turkey and now w/ control of political power (ie there's no need to exploit religion any more) and simply lack of people (majority is now urban) religiosity may have peaked already.  The trajectory will be different there probably especially if what we hear about educated Turks preferring to come back here is true.  

BTW, Turks in Germany may have had a role in the resurgence of political Islam here in Turkey.  Even in the 70's we'd hear about Sharia-seeking etc. organizations in Germany that simply wouldn't be allowed much latitude here.  There has been some money flow and swindling of the Turks there that funded political organizations and propaganda outlets (TV channels etc.) here.  I served in the army with some of those people, and the ones who were deeply in radical religious organizations seem to have been radicalized in Germany rather than having been being sent there in that shape.  

&gt;But as soon as you recommend anything but ""Turkish lessons for everybody"" or something like that, you're a racist which makes the problem basically unsolvable.

I understand what a nightmare it might be for all involved.  What did the people who made these decisions to import labor originally think, I wonder?  Over here, it doesn't look like much thought was put into it and it was ""great, we didn't know what to do with these people anyway and remittances would be excellent.""
