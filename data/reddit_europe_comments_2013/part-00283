Your boarding pass and luggage ticket remains linked in the airline database as long as they have the flight date, call the Airline and ask for that information, Its CRUCIAL that you atleast attempt it and Fight it to the best of your abilities, sometimes it can be pulled off.

As for where to get new stuff, the Principe Pio Mall is close by, its right Over the train station so you can directly take the cercanias commuter train Line C1 (Principe pio direction), and C10 (viallba direction) and it will take you to principe pio, Just make sure you´re going in the right direction, 

Or you can take line 1 Metro line in pinar de chanmartin direction, get of in tribunal station, get on line 10 in direction of Puerta del sur and get off directly at principe pio, as i said, its right above the station so you cant miss it.

Bada bene che l'articolo usa la parola ""minacce"" solo due volte, e non dice mai ""minacce di morte"".

Tutte le frasi usate nell'articolo sono: ""insulti su Facebook"", ""bersaglio degli animalisti"", ""insulti e auguri di morte"", ""30 auguri di morte e oltre 500 offese di vario tipo"", ""nel mirino degli animalisti"", ""valanga di insulti e minacce"", ""dalle offese e le minacce che le sono piovute addosso"".

La natura delle minacce non è specificata. Dunque l'articolo in generale non mi sembra esagerato.

Si può dire che un augurio di morte non è di per sé illegale – lascio la discussione a giudici e giuristi – e dunque non giornalisticamente rilevante, e si può dire che a non tutti interessano i battibecchi su Facebook – ma qui si entra sul soggettivo.",0,1388232818,null,0,false,0,cebtozl,t3_1ttbk2,t1_cebtozl,t1_cebsbb6,null,1427958059,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

In cassia coumarin level is generally higher by magnitudes but also varies a lot between species and even between sticks in the same retail package.

According to [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385612/) their sample of *C. verum* was coumarin-free as opposed to samples of cassia which contained between 2.6 to 7.0 g/kg of coumarin. Similar observation was also made by [Sproll et al](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/223370583_HPLC_analysis_and_safety_assessment_of_coumarin_in_foods) who reported their five samples of true cinnamon as coumarin-free or below detection but high coumarin contents between 2.8-4.8 g/kg in their samples of cassia. And also [Wang et al](http://www.cinnamonvogue.com/DOWNLOADS/Cinnamon_and_coumarin.pdf) reported only traces of coumarin in their 17 samples of true cinnamon (down to 0.005 g/kg) but high levels in their samples of cassia (up to 9.30 g/kg in *C.

The Gendarmerie is traditionally part of the ministry of defense, while policing is now, as far as I know, everywhere a job of the ministry of the interior or similar.

After the war in Austria the Gendarmerie was the only national police body, under control of the ministry of the interior already, what was called ""Polizei"" was only for criminal investigations and walked the streets in the larger cities (a direct local replacement of the Gendarmerie). So, growing up, naive me saw the Gendarmerie always as the police of the countryside. Eventually they merged to a single ""Bundespolizei"".

On the topic, a South Tyrolean friend told me once about Italy, which apparently does have competing executive forces too, which are also unnecessary heavily armed. The idea is that all combined firepower under control of the ministry of the interior should be comparable to the army under control of the ministry of defense, as a safeguard against coups. The stories of a South Tyrolean about the Italians should be taken with a grain of salt, though :)

My guess is that the Gendarmerie in France did survive close to it's traditional form, with an additional ""police"" for cities and special tasks.",0,1388235099,null,0,false,0,cebtzoa,t3_1tu8y0,t1_cebtzoa,t1_cebtnl0,null,1427957921,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

I particularly love the quote ""democracy is fine as long as nothing changes"" when he was speaking to the fact that coups were only affecting progressive governments and that right wing administrations weren't affected. 

I think that this is likely universal and speaks to the idea that all reforms must not only be done for a common goal and interest but incrementally enough to not threaten such a diverse set of economic interests. Even if the benefits are clear, fast reform is a risk and member states will not tolerate that without incremental success first. I doubt that reforms will lead to revolution in Europe but members will certainly opt to weaken the EU's power rather than accept fast change. 

The lesson learned here would be that the most stable and successful EU institutions will be excruciatingly conservative in their timelines and spend the bulk of their efforts identifying common, non controversial benefits.  Big changes will certainly come but they must come incrementally and at a barely perceptible pace. Aggression in the near term will likely weaken the union in the medium to long term.

I would describe all their food stuff at least as decent. Well, at least all the basic stuff. Going to Aldi for their crappy frozen pizza or other such food would be a very bad idea. Aldi and the rest of the discounters are good for basic ingredients, not so good for ready-made stuff.

You can buy most of your bulk stuff (e.g. flour, cream, milk, eggs, even vegetables and fruit or chicken breast) there without worrying too much. If I don’t like certain products I can get from Aldi (their Parmesan sucks in my opinion) I just go to the Edeka. There tend to be large differences from Edeka to Edeka, but the one closest to me is huge, brand new and has a great selection. Rewe is also ok, but I really have to say that I had my best experiences in Edekas. When I go there I tend to buy brand-name stuff, mostly because if I wouldn’t there wouldn’t be much point to going to Edeka. Their store-brand stuff is not necessarily better than the store-brand stuff you can get at Aldi. That, in my experience, is generally true.

But in the end you gotta try. For example, besides the Parmesan I also hate Aldi South’s canned tomatoes. They are just too sour. Norma’s canned tomatoes are decent. (Finding good canned tomatoes is a horror story in Germany. All I want to make is some kick-ass tomato sauce. You wouldn’t think that would be so hard.

The Romani are an ethnic group dispersed throughout most of Europe and also found in Western Asia and the Americas. In many cases (but not by any means all) they live in their own societies and have limited ""integration"" into the majority society of the country in which they live. 

The Romani have a long history of being on the margins of European society, and unfortunately they have often been treated very badly. It might be useful to think of their situation as similar to that of Jews before the creation of Israel, a nation disperesed throughout many other countries facing very high levels of prejudice. In fact Roma people were one of the targets of Nazi genocide along with Jews.

Many Roma are very poor and they are often seen begging in the streets of European cities. In some cases this begging is in fact a part of organised crime and that is one of the reasons why people will often not give them money. The hatred you mention may be partly because of this, but I personally worry that it goes deeper than that and has roots similar to those of anti-semitism - an old and very deeply ingrained European form of racism or at least xenophobia towards marginalised groups.

I could only find one article in english [and it's really old](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8226580.stm) but the situation hasn't really changed all that much.

I am not saying gipsies are negesarally criminals, but it is a known fact that at least over here, if you are a homeless person you need to have a ""pimp"" to let you beg in a ""hotspot"". There was a good documentary about a family of gipsies living in London that made insurance fraud, because they had ""to pay their dues"". There where also a couple of news stories about gipsy mobsters running prostitution rings in Spain and Switzerland (the latter was actually reported as a good thing in a weird patriotic way). 

Also, you need to understand that a romanian that comes to your country with the intent of begging or stealing will need money to get there, a base of operations and a support group(to place stolen goods), all these are provided by the traffickers at a cost.

Poor people and homeless people are recruited and even mutilated to ""sell"" the fantasy, they rarely actually get to use the money you give them, and rarely use it for food.

Now the really needy, rural rromani rarely venture into the city and are ""discouraged"" by these mobsters to beg because they only crowd up the streets.

I really want you to understand the fact that not all gypsies are equal, [these](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2285796/Romanian-gypsies-living-condemned-ghetto-mayor-built-wall-around.html) are discriminated and underprivileged rromani that if given a fair chance can become respectfull citizens, [these](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2051482/Child-beggars-young-making-100-000-year-gypsy-gangs.html) are criminals and exploiters and by tollerating them you are only making [the problem worst](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24613781).",0,1388243714,null,0,1388256836,0,cebvkpb,t3_1tu8y0,t1_cebvkpb,t1_cebswn6,null,1427957182,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Now, a few really useful things:

* Get a Metro map or download an EMT or Metro app for your phone. Any place you want to go, you'll go on Metro or bus. Google maps is pretty good too.

* With that map, mark where the US embassy is. You never know. Also, find the most convenient police stations, postal offices and such.

* If you need some really specific things, consider moving to the city center. There you'll find everything, from stinky tofu to beef jerky, for instance.

* Any place where most people speaks English is a **bad** place to be. Tourists don't understand the value of things in here, so most of the time they're charged extra. Pro tip: if a place is advertised as ""the best paella"", ""the best jamon"", etc, just avoid it. It is not the best, and it'll cost you way more than it should.

* If you're up to share a flat, avoid American roomates. I mean, you want to learn and wander around, trying to ""feel like home"" won't help you, trust me. Oh, craiglist won't help you a lot here, try with fotocasa or idealista better.

* Get a prepaid cellphone simcard. Without at least a spanish phone number, you'll be pretty much screwed. Also, try to get a bank account, and remember, American Express is not very popular here, Discover is pretty much unknown.

* Food is cheaper here. That said, vegetarians have usually a hard time because most places don't have a veggie only option.

* Alcohol is way cheaper than the US, **but**, never, ever go into the cheapest place around. Some places have a bad reputation of serving poor quality beverages. If you don't want to take the risk, just stick with beer. Cocktails are stronger too, like the beer. If you are used to light beers or lady cocktails... Well, you may find this quite different.

* If some guy offers you free shots (""chupitos"") while on a night out, I can assure you it's not worth it.

* If you have allergies, ask first what those things in your plate are. If you have not, eat first, ask later. You'll find some flavours interesting.

* ""Toros"" or bullfighting is not as fun as most people think it is. Still, if you want to see a ""corrida"", that is, a bullfighting event, you should go to Ventas (green line in the Metro system), and expect a slaughter.

* ""Corrida"" is also ""cum"". Learn about double meaning words. You can thank me later. Pro tip: avoid Casa de Campo and calle Montera, and if some random girl smiles at you in one of those places, just keep walking, she's probably a prostitute.

* Touristic buses, stores in Gran Via, kiosks in Sol, etc, those you don't want to spend your money in.

* And again, for fucks sake, go around and meet different people. Going out with other Americans or making American friends is a huge mistake. Most people don't realize how bad is keeping a ""comfortable"" friend circle.

According to the Economist, no.

&gt;How is this in any way different than when the US or the UK perform the exact same operation?

Money is channelled either as credits for a particular export project or via an agency such as USAID, World Bank, IFC, IMF, TACIS, DFID, GTZ or whoever. They provide a framework (you must propose a project with clear success criteria) and auditing. It doe not stop money from being diverted, but it makes it substantially more difficult.

&gt;You can, of course, provide sources to support these claims?

There are quotes from many leaders who have met with Putin about the deference with which he is regarded by his aides. This is unhealthy. Look at the flip-flopping around about the Luis Vuitton trunk on Red Square as a trivial example.

&gt; Putin was a KGB spy; this was an organization that took the best and the brightest of soviet Russia's students for several generations,

Nope. It took the most **compliant**. I have met with a KGB General and with some lower staff and former staff members. They are pretty damn good on psychology but they are clueless about technology and markets.

&gt;He's managed to practically take over one of the largest countries in the world.

He was handed it on a plate by Yelstin and the oligarchs and he secured his position with the second Chechen war which was started on some very dodgy premises.

&gt;Also, what mistakes is he making? Most of the people saying he is making mistakes are western interests

Plenty of Russians agree. The issue is that the Russin Federation was starting to move away from a dependency on raw materials in the late nineties, but Putin shut that down. Why invest money in an enterprise that can be stolen by the state tomorrow?

&gt;This implies that the most effective way to develop Oil/Gas is on a normal commercial basis. Your biases are showing.

The issue is that to develop a field, you have to be able to get the petrochemicals out of the ground to a market. The Russian comapnies should have been investing in their infrastructure rather than sponsoring the world's most expensive Olympic games. If they choose to hold wealth back, so be it. I think that Norway's Statoil is a very good example together with the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth fund for preserving wealth for the future. The issue is that without developing the reserves on a slow but continual basis, there will be problems. This is why Russia is attempting to produce a lot of new nuclear power plants, which will liberate more gas for export but will take a number of years to come on line. 

&gt;However, the issue is that the alternative solutions that exist in your country have often been tried, and were found to be even worse within that culture. 

Nope. Running businesses in an open manner and with an open state regulatory framework was never tried.

/Should add 

&gt;National scale change happens on the scale of generations, we've haven't even gone through two decades.

Tell that to the DDR or even China which now enjoys a far more open business climate than Russia. It annoys me that more western companies would go to India than seek a partnership in Russia now. There is corruption in the Russian education system too, but Russian scientists and engineers remain amongst the best.

I should add that I retain close links to Russia and was actually employed over there during the late nineties implementing reform/transformation measures.  The measures had to be abandoned after Putin's election as companies became rightfully scared again of making their structure open. Strangely enough, my local partner was an organisation established by Mr Putin.

true,uututhrwa,null,null,"I don't understand wtf you are asking, and I can't bother to reread the shit I was on about (I was probably trolling that clueless dude above).

So a summary of what I think I was saying.

Ancient Macedonians were a tribe of Ancient Greeks. Ancient Macedonia didn't include FYROM in it. FYROM's region was a kingdom that were enemies of A. Macedonians (Dardania).

After Alexander etc. many Macedonians and other Greeks were dispersed throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms (from present day Egypt to Afghanistan etc.)

Many stayed in Greece. And the distinction between Macedonian /Athenian / Spartan etc. stopped having a meaning.

Then the Romans came, and later Slavs, Bulgars, Vlachs, Albanians. And the Ottoman empire. (And in 1920 Greek refugees from Anatolia) Of course they mixed to some extent, but then again not completely (look at the ""nations of the Rum millet"", and how parts of it wanted to be a seperate millet etc. etc.)

The point is, a group that up until then identified as Bulgarians, around 1930 started telling a story that has nothing to do with true history. 

da___ says that their bullshit are on the same level as the greek version, but this is false, if they were to say ""we are also descendants of Ancient Greeks and Ancient Macedonians"" then it would. 

The Skopjans go to the next level though, because they are already only doing the whole ""ancient nation"" thing to make the 40% of their population that feels Bulgarian stop.

In a scenario like this, I think the amount of sexism present is actually pretty negligible. It's also important to keep in mind that sexual objectification and sexism are two different things, not necessarily mutually exclusive. Sexism can be a very dangerous, very demeaning thing at times.

You're going to need to do a lot of work to convince me that a 150 year old, rather conservative UK newspaper is an unbiased source.

&gt; They provide a framework (you must propose a project with clear success criteria) and auditing. It doe not stop money from being diverted, but it makes it substantially more difficult.

We have not actually seen the details of this agreement shared publicly as of yet. The idea that it does not provide for this sort of framework is based on hearsay.

&gt; There are quotes from many leaders who have met with Putin about the deference with which he is regarded by his aides. This is unhealthy.

Deference in front of world leaders is to be expected. You want to present a unified front during such a public event. This behavior is taken pretty much word for word from classic political manuals.

&gt; Look at the flip-flopping around about the Luis Vuitton trunk on Red Square as a trivial example.

This is a simple response to popular opinion. The decision has no political value, but scored some points with the average Moscow resident. This has about the same amount of gravity as Obama flip-flopping on the state of the White House gardens.

&gt; Nope. It took the most compliant. I have met with a KGB General and with some lower staff and former staff members. 

My parents went to some of the top universities in Moscow of their era. At the time the people that went to the KGB were by far the top of the class.

&gt; They are pretty damn good on psychology but they are clueless about technology and markets.

So they are old is what you're saying? This is no different than an average US Congressman or UK MP of the same age.

&gt; He was handed it on a plate by Yelstin and the oligarchs and he secured his position with the second Chechen war which was started on some very dodgy premises.

Yeltsin would be surprised to hear that. The power transfer was quite the conflict given that Putin and Yeltsin represent diametrically opposed political factions.

&gt; Plenty of Russians agree.

And they will agree that the sky is green and gravity pulls upwards as long as it helps them remove Putin, and put themselves into power.

&gt; The issue is that the Russin Federation was starting to move away from a dependency on raw materials in the late nineties, but Putin shut that down. Why invest money in an enterprise that can be stolen by the state tomorrow?

Russian enterprise is growing at a fairly reasonable rates. Of course there are speed bumps and variations in the economy, but when is there not? The Russian economy is subject to economic cycles too.

A lot of the cuts in the late nineties were meant to score direct hits off Yeltsin's power base. These were mostly people that were getting huge handouts which they took for their personal fortunes. Western media portrayed it as some sort of grand attack on capitalism, but most enterprise was unaffected, it was purely a political tactic. True, it sounds very crude by Western standards, but that is simply the reality of that culture.

&gt; The Russian comapnies should have been investing in their infrastructure rather than sponsoring the world's most expensive Olympic games. 

One does not exclude the other. Large companies often sponsor highly visible events for marketing purposes.

&gt; If they choose to hold wealth back, so be it. I think that Norway's Statoil is a very good example together with the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth fund for preserving wealth for the future. The issue is that without developing the reserves on a slow but continual basis, there will be problems. This is why Russia is attempting to produce a lot of new nuclear power plants, which will liberate more gas for export but will take a number of years to come on line.

So what you're saying is they are investing in their infrastructure, just not in a way that you feel is optimal.

&gt; Nope. Running businesses in an open manner and with an open state regulatory framework was never tried.

I wouldn't necessarily agree that's been tried anywhere yet, much less Russia. Certainly the US and UK play off the illusion of open and fair regulation, all the way until you start digging and find layers of corruption buried beneath a tangled mess of laws and bureaucracy. 

Next, how do you implement a fully open system in a country that has existed around corruption for centuries. You can't just crop and paste an entire cultural structure however you please. There are still existing powers in place that will prevent changes. In effect that's like going into an MMA hexagon, and asking the fighters to stop fighting for a minute to give each other a hug and knit a scarf. 

&gt; Tell that to the DDR or even China which now enjoys a far more open business climate than Russia. It annoys me that more western companies would go to India than seek a partnership in Russia now.

Russian GDP per capita is 10x of India and 2x of China. The only reason for any sort of ""more open"" climate is the fact that both of those countries are significantly cheaper to do business with. You're not going to build facilities in Russia, when the same facilities will cost you half the price one country over.

&gt; There is corruption in the Russian education system too, but Russian scientists and engineers remain amongst the best.

I'm not sure what point you want to argue here. If the scientists and engineers remain among the best, then they are ahead of the curve.

&gt; I should add that I retain close links to Russia and was actually employed over there during the late nineties implementing reform/transformation measures. The measures had to be abandoned after Putin's election as companies became rightfully scared again of making their structure open. Strangely enough, my local partner was an organisation established by Mr Putin. My boss on the western side even had dinner with him.

Based on your background your position is very understandable. You were involved with the faction that was ostensibly against Putin, so your perspective is constructed from that context. I think you should step back and consider a wider variety of views.

My only interest in Russia is the fact that it is technically my ethnic background. I will occasionally refer to sources from both sides, but for the most part I honestly don't care one way or the other. There are too many things closer to home that require more of my attention.

You can see why such a message would be threatening to a bigoted establishment. The uneasy fact is that despite being one of the most liberating and progressive forces in modern history, centralised general education can be and has been used for promoting and maintaining arbitrary cultural differences between people, manipulating the masses into helping and maintaining the privileged in power, promoting hate and intolerance and of course justifying violence and mass murder as something encouraged and sometimes heroic.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"Um, okay, firstly I need to clarify that *I* do not believe that Italians are not white. Race is a construct based on visual perception, so anyone with pale-ish skin is ""white."" Europeans are all white, as are Turks, Arabs, Berbers, Iranians, and many Indians. There's not a clear-cut distinction in skin tone between ""white"" and ""non-white,"" so basically it's a gut feeling based on the amount of melanin in someone's skin.

I don't personally know anybody who thinks Italians, Greeks, or Spaniards aren't white. A hefty proportion of the population in this part of the US (New England) is Italian, and we all pretty much agree that we're all white. I don't know which Americans you've been talking to, because around here, it is the consensus that all Mediterranean-looking people are ""white."" It is the ""old-timey super-racists"" that I mentioned who did not consider any non-Germanic (or French, I guess) peoples to be ""white.""

Now, as for Italy never being attacked by non-Europeans, that's just not true. The whole of Sicily was under Muslim Arab-Berber control for more than a hundred years.* Rome was [sacked by Arabs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(846\)) in 846, with St. Peter's Basilica being plundered. There was no long-lasting non-European control over the Italian peninsula itself, making any accusations of Italians being ""non-European"" rather silly, but it's not accurate to say that Italy was never attacked by non-Europeans.

I went to Madrid when i was 18 yo and have lived there since then. 
Some tips i can give you are: 

- Try to find accomodation close to the place you are going to study/work/whatever you want to do here. Subway is pretty good to go full tourist on weekends and holidays but daily traffic jams are deadly.

- Avoid english written places, these are tourist places and aren´t worth it. If it is written in English they want your money bro. (irish pubs and british community places are the exception to that rule)

- Be extra safe with your pockets/bag/purse. If you dont look like a spaniard you are a target for pickpocketers. This is especially important around tourist zones/monuments.

I could give you more insight or even help you. I live in Madrid, pretty close to the city centre. PM if you want any more info. 

(PS: Learn some spanish before coming, very few people can speak english fluently.)

It's a calendar from a company that sells to banks, specifically executive management at banks / decision-makers. It's not for the likes of you.

I'm assuming you don't earn a six-figure salary in an executive position at a large institution, because these sorts of things are surprisingly common almost everywhere if you're in a position of considerable authority or financial means. In finance, it's being part of the 'boy's club,' and is usually reserved for mid to high-level 'executive' management, but not top-level management. These tiers are usually male, middle-aged or below and susceptible to this sort of marketing. In some cases (such as contract negotiations), one could consider a calendar like this more of a catalogue, if you catch my meaning.

When we had the talk from them about protection for ""high tech"" industries, I had Russians apologising to me that the FSB presenter was a dinosaur, totally out of touch.

&gt; Certainly the US and UK play off the illusion of open and fair regulation

Funnily enough, if you talk to the guys at Transparency International, they agree that although problems remain amongst the better countries, there is substantially less corruption in the US or the UK than the Russian Federation.

It is actually interesting to go to countries bordering directly with Russia like Finland or even to the town of Ivangorod which is adjacent to the town of Narva in Estonia. They were the same in 1990 or so. Now the roads are decaying in Ivangorod, and the place is decaying whilst Narva prospers.

&gt;You're not going to build facilities in Russia, when the same facilities will cost you half the price one country over.

Pull the other one. The issue is that if you invest in Russia, there is no protection for your investment. I know people who have moved their companies to Finland - taxes higher, costs higher and so on because of issues with the Russian authorities.

&gt;I'm not sure what point you want to argue here. If the scientists and engineers remain among the best, then they are ahead of the curve.

Yes, but they are leaving. Wasn't it two Russian scientists who found the new graphene process whilst working in the UK? Entry into prestigious institutions like the MGU or whatever is through examination or a quiet cash subscription and the same, regrettably goes for graduation.

&gt;You were involved with the faction that was ostensibly against Putin, so your perspective is constructed from that context. I think you should step back and consider a wider variety of views.

They weren't against Putin when he came to power although I had raised red flags on his announced policy of ""reexamining privatisation"". The issue is that the shares since then had changed hands many times. His approach essentially was an attack on the idea of property. This takes away confidence from foreign direct investment. Much smart Russian money has fled Russia like your parents. It sits offshore where it is safe and then comes in for specific projects. A better approach is the so-called windfall profits tax. This is fair and would catch everyone who was profiting excessively, but that would be a problem for Putin's backers.

I applaud the fact that pensions and the salaries of state employees are being paid on time. However, the overall state of development of Russia continues to decline as the older industries close. Not enough newer ones are  being founded.

C'est le cas actuellement. Il n'y a aucune raison de toucher aux lois sur le harcèlement.

&gt;On aurait le droit d'insulter ou de diffamer une fois, mais pas dix?

Absolument :

Le harcèlement est un enchaînement d'agissements hostiles **dont la répétition** affaiblit psychologiquement l'individu qui en est la victime.

C'est la définition. 

&gt;La zoophilie étant interdite, il s'agit d'une accusation grave au sens de la loi et il est normal que la loi m'en protège.

""Il est normal"" n'est pas un argument. 

Pour accuser de manière sérieuse, il faut des preuves. Tu as un droit de réponse et si les propos sont de nature à entraîner des sanctions judiciaires, administratives ou disciplinaires, ça s'appelle de la dénonciation calomnieuse. 

J'ignorais que la zoophilie était interdite, et vérification faite elle l'est depuis 2004. Ça relève donc de la dénonciation calomnieuse et donc aucun rapport avec la diffamation.

Cherche un autre argument.

&gt;Je suppose donc que Salengro, que tu cites plus bas, n'avait pas ""assez d'honneur""?

Pour se suicider, il faut être cliniquement malade (dépression) et ne pas se soigner (même si, à l'époque, je ne sais pas si les traitements existaient). Rien à voir avec les propos de diffamation. S'ils étaient répétés, ça relevait du harcèlement.

Toujours pas besoin de diffamation en droit.

&gt;On en serait réduit à ""c'est celui qui parle le plus fort qui gagne"". Est-ce vraiment ce que tu veux?

Oui. Je préfère ça à ""c'est celui à qui on a donné le droit de parler qui gagne"".

&gt;ton argument est que, puisque certaines propagandes échappent à la loi, autant supprimer la loi?

Non. Mon argument est qu'il n'y a pas de liberté d'opinion si tout le monde ne peut pas dire ce qu'il pense, sauf menaces physiques.

Je répondais à ton argument sur les bretons. Il y a déjà de la propagande qui essaie de convaincre que les beaufs, les hommes blancs de classe populaire, sont des sous-hommes.

&gt;Puisque la loi contre la diffamation n'a pas pu prévenir le cas que tu cites, autant la supprimer?

Il existe d'autres lois pour les cas où l'intégrité physique ou juridique est menacée. Il ne devrait dans les autres cas y avoir aucune conséquence.

No, we've cut military spending in a region which heavily depends on us for power projection; specifically in the areas of logistics and intelligence gathering. 

Libya, Mali &amp; The Balkans all required United States support; and all were called for by Europe. 

[Libya, Europe and the future of NATO: Always waiting for the U.S. Cavalry](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato)

&gt;America was visibly reluctant to get involved, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies. 

[NATO Commander: EU could not do Libya without US](http://euobserver.com/defence/115650)

&gt;NATO Major-General Marcel Druart, addressing the European Parliament committee on security and defence on Tuesday (20 March), said NATO relied heavily on US military expertise on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

[French urgency, U.S. caution collide in Mali operation](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/26/us-usa-france-mali-idUSBRE90P04N20130126)

&gt;*(Reuters)* - France's military intervention in Mali has revived trans-Atlantic tensions over security issues, this time involving a key counterterrorism battlefield, along with dismay from critics who see U.S. President Barack Obama as too reluctant to use military force.

[Dempsey: France formally asks for U.S. aid in Mali](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/)

&gt;The French government has formally requested U.S. military assistance to combat al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in Mali, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the American Forces Press Service on Thursday

[U.S. aiding France's military operation in Mali](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563710/)

&gt;*BAMAKO, MALI* - France's foreign minister said Sunday that the United States is providing communications and transport help for an international military intervention aimed at wresting Mali's north out of the hands of Islamist extremists.

The last one doesn't even mention the Special Forces we put down in Niger, a country neighboring Mali and the one which provides up to 20% of France's Uranium *(also the realpoltick reason I believe France got involved in Mali in the first place)*. Or the massive intelligence support we gave as well.

And keep in mind that Europe, as of now, is doing all it can to hinder military integration. France and the United Kingdom, the only two countries in the European Union with actual power projection, are making massive military cuts. Countries increasing military spending is unlikely, despite the fact that only three members of the European Union actually spend the required 2% of their GDP on military spending that NATO stipulates; Greece, the United Kingdom &amp; Cyprus *(France recently cut their budget down to 1.8% because of economic woes)*. 

You bitch and moan and complain about United States influence. Well if you don't like it, do something about it. Either integrate closer militarily and increase funding so you can project power independent of the United States, or convince your government to stop calling for shit like Kosovo or Libya or Mali, all of which had to entail United States support. Though keep in mind you will no longer be able to intervene on humanitarian grounds in such a instance, but that's the sacrifice you will have to make if you don't want to integrate or increase military funding. 

Or perhaps you're like your hypocritical ass politicians. The same ones who deride my country and call us jingoistic, imperialistic bastards, but in the next breath have no problem outsourcing their military responsibility and power projection to us so they can spend more money on social services, but at the cost of increasing U.S. influence in your government. 

Your choice, I don't care. The Cold War is over and the Fulda Gap doesn't exist anymore. We're moving away from our old Europe-based strategy and *""Pivoting to the Pacific/Asia""*, where 60% of our Air Force and Navy will be stationed. Europe's future is in your hands. Integrate and become a global great power as the European Union, or divide and have your individual nations become pawns of Russia, China &amp; the United States.

That isn't necessarily representative of the entire organization as a whole. These ""dinosaurs"" are usually figureheads chosen to fill a cushy spot as a result of past service. They are given papers to sign, and they take junkets to all the fancy places to read off a card of talking points. This illusion likely serves the organization's interests too. If you think that they are completely out of touch then you are more likely to underestimate them. 

&gt; Funnily enough, if you talk to the guys at Transparency International, they agree that although problems remain amongst the better countries, there is substantially less corruption in the US or the UK than the Russian Federation.

I didn't mean to imply that Russia was that close to the US and UK. My point was that it is all a matter of magnitude. The difference tend to be much easier to understand through a cultural lens. It's not that Russia is doing something fundamentally different, it's that they're doing the same thing every one else is, but taking it further due to the history of the people.

&gt; It is actually interesting to go to countries bordering directly with Russia like Finland or even to the town of Ivangorod which is adjacent to the town of Narva in Estonia. They were the same in 1990 or so. Now the roads are decaying in Ivangorod, and the place is decaying whilst Narva prospers.

That's a bit of an unfair comparison. Narva is the third largest city in Estonia with 4% of the nation's population and .1% of the land area. Meanwhile Ivangorod is a tiny town representing 0.007% of the Russian population and minuscule 0.00004% of the land area. The comparative scale and size of these nations means that the levels of investment in local infrastructure will be vastly different, even though the actual size and population numbers are deceptively close.

&gt; Pull the other one. The issue is that if you invest in Russia, there is no protection for your investment. I know people who have moved their companies to Finland - taxes higher, costs higher and so on because of issues with the Russian authorities.

Ok, then why bring up China? According to the IFC they are only slightly [more reliable](http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/protecting-investors) than Russia. 

Granted, I'm sure there are situations where people will pull out of Russia because they deem their investments to be at risk. However, you are completely dismissing all other possible causes while arguing based on individual instances of personal experience. What more, in your earlier posts you made it sound like your contacts were people that the current administration would not favor, which raises the question of other factors that may be involved in the behavior you have seen.

&gt; Yes, but they are leaving. Wasn't it two Russian scientists who found the new graphene process whilst working in the UK? Entry into prestigious institutions like the MGU or whatever is through examination or a quiet cash subscription and the same, regrettably goes for graduation.

They are leaving because Russia has largely stopped funding research. If that's what you meant by ""corruption in education"" I can concede that point. 

Entry into high level technical programs aren't very popular bribe-bait, simply because there's not much you can get out of that. Entry into business programs is more likely to attract such problems, but this is a problem localized to Russia since few international companies would hire Russian business graduates when they have Ivy Leaguers to chose from. In fact most of the successful Russian business people I know complete a Russian university (though honest means or not), and then went to a top US school.

&gt; The issue is that the shares since then had changed hands many times. His approach essentially was an attack on the idea of property. This takes away confidence from foreign direct investment.

At the same time it attracts local voters who worked their entire lives under Soviet Russia, and were left with next to nothing. You can't just prioritize foreign direct investment at the exclusion of all local factors.

&gt; Much smart Russian money has fled Russia like your parents. It sits offshore where it is safe and then comes in for specific projects.

We left Russia with the clothes on our back and nothing else. My dad is one of those super smart scientists, but he never had a very good feel for the markets, nor the courage to face a potential loss. My parents build their entire life up from scratch here though contributions to science.

The issue is most of this ""smart Russian money"" fled Russia well before Putin. They got the money out of Russia the instant the could, because they understood that the sweet times could not last. This pissed off a whole lot of people, so in effect this smart money directly contributed to creating the situation as it is now.

&gt; A better approach is the so-called windfall profits tax. This is fair and would catch everyone who was profiting excessively, but that would be a problem for Putin's backers.

I agree it would be nice to have this sort of system, but it would be opposed by most anyone in power in Russia. This is not unique to Putin.

&gt; I applaud the fact that pensions and the salaries of state employees are being paid on time. However, the overall state of development of Russia continues to decline as the older industries close. Not enough newer ones are being founded. The excuse could be made that they want to go directly to a post-industrial services-based economy but there is little evidence of that either.

I figure it is best to adopt the wait-and-see approach. Right now Russia needs to see the old Soviet pensioners through their twilight years. Once that's all been resolved I would not be surprised if there was a major shakeup in the leadership as the more modern, more business savvy younger generation takes over.",0,1388256707,null,0,1388257088,0,cebzqw0,t3_1towdl,t1_cebzqw0,t1_cebynmt,null,1427955165,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Umm it's not arbitrary. They have different facial features.

Not really. Most Turks are, in fact, the descendants of Turkified Greek Anatolians. They're really the same population, like Serbs and Croats. There is a self-conscious *national* distinction, based on language and religion, but there is not really an *ethnic* difference between them.

The point that I am trying to make is that the distinction between ""Greek"" and ""Turkish"" facial features, despite both having the same basic skin tone, makes Greeks ""white"" and Turks ""non-white,"" is just as arbitrary as the distinction between ""pale"" skin making one ""white"" and ""olive"" skin making one ""non-white.""

My argument is that race is essentially an arbitrary distinction based purely on skin color, while you are the one bringing cultural components into the distinctions between ""races,"" but you're not being any *less* arbitrary in your distinctions.

&gt; You sure about that? I'm pretty sure I'm not brown. At all. Nor do I know anyone Italian who is actually brown. Like really. I don't know how pale you are(maybe you're Irish or something) but I'm pretty sure that if I were in America you'd only recognize me because of my accent.

I'm a mix of various northern European ethnicities--Lithuanian, Swedish, English, Scottish, French, and Irish--and I am pretty pale, but that's irrelevant. And I was being sarcastic when I said that ""y'all look pretty brown to me:"" the point is that race is often arbitrarily decided to mean ""people I don't like who are a shade darker than I am."" To Britons, that means Frenchmen; to northern Europeans, that means southern and eastern Europeans; to southern Europeans, that means North Africans and Levantines; to Levantines and North Africans, that means Bedouins; to Bedouins, that means black Africans. Everyone considers themselves ""white"" and the people they don't like as ""less white."" 

The implication of OP's comment was that ""Eastern Europeans and Slavs"" might be perceived or treated as ""non-white"" in some European countries. I'm not an expert, but it would not be hard to believe that it may be the case that, just like you make the distinction between Greeks (""white"") and Turks (""non-white Caucasians"") based on their facial features, other Western Europeans may make the distinction between Western Europeans (""white"") and Slavic Eastern Europeans (""non-white Caucasians"") based on their facial features rather than on their skin tone.",0,1388259541,null,0,false,0,cec0s8s,t3_1tri9z,t1_cec0s8s,t1_cebzzs6,null,1427954680,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

If you noticed the [declarations by Jens Weidmann](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/30/us-ecb-weidmann-idUSBRE99T1AR20131030), the governor of the Bundesbank, when he told that the next stress test on the banking sector will be performed by allowing for different risk coefficients for sovereign bonds, this means that the “whatever it takes” statement by Mario Draghi was a bluff, because if Mario Draghi was right, government bonds would be riskless. That means that in Germany some people are getting sick of that situation, and want to dismantle the euro, and the declarations by Hans-Werner Sinn, that Berlusconi was sacked because he was preparing a euro exit for Italy, are also very telling in this respect. Sinn has always said that Southern countries should go out of the euro, and he is a German economist. If he makes such a statement it is a very important political signal.


&gt; Well, you are the good guys, you did the reforms, that’s good, your goods are more affordable, fine, we will buy them, wonderful, you are a surplus country, bravo, clap the hands, but if in order to buy German goods we had to buy German currency, the German currency would appreciate, and that would re-establish an equilibrium. And it is a market! We are living in a Soviet system, where we have planned the most important price for an economy, the price of its currency.

For instance when a new supermarket comes to town a lot of folks start shopping there. As a result the local high street shops tend to go out of business. Then people lament the change despite themselves being a large reason for that change. Yet sad that the local shops aren't around any more but I'd rather have the big supermarket as evidenced by the fact that I spend money there rather than at the local shops which are going out of business.

No, socialist policies are disregarded as populist, as conservative policies are seen as corrupt pro corporate measures. This is how politics works, you need to understand that the government cant pay for the well being of its people indefinitely.(except for Cuba).

misery and stagnation?....WTF the last time I checked we could afford non-industrial food, collage degrees and high speed internet. We look at americans and their hunger for growth and stand proud at the fact that ours is organic and doesn't imply sacrificing the well being of our citizens. 

Think about how far we've come in the last 20 years, sure it sucked, and sometimes you feel we're moving so slow that we're actually going backwards but the fact is that we are constantly increasing our living standards without abusing the social contract, and beyond economic indicators that is the only thing that matters. 

Greece, and Ireland are cautionary tales more than anything, you can't cheat macroeconomics in the long term, and we can build on that unlike the americans and chinese that still bet everything on diyng horses.

Pagato a settembre 142 Euro spedizione inclusa, ordinato tramite un negozio affiliato ad Amazon. Posso garantire che supera in tutto e per tutto il Samsung della stessa fascia di prezzo che la mia signora ha ricevuto con il contratto telefonico.

Pro:

- esperienza molto, molto simile ad un Android ""puro""; interfaccia standard e con pochi fronzoli, praticamente nessuna applicazione aggiuntiva

- schermo ottimo, perfettamente visibile e luminoso.

- community anche italiana di modder abbastanza numerosa; il thread su Andoridiani.it e' pieno di gente entusiasta

Contro:

- non fa certo foto eccelse

- il GPS mi ha fatto penare parecchio, ma adesso sembra funzionare molto bene

- il volume della suoneria passa da troppo silenzioso a troppo forte senza soluzione di continuita'

- la vibrazione e' impercettibile

- se mi si rompe lo butto via, non sto certo a perder tempo a spedirlo in cina per la riparazione

Francamente sono convinto che a parita' di prezzo non c'e' nulla di simile che venga venduto dalle marche tradizionali (Samsung, HTC, LG, Sony, Nexus).

No society that I know of, save perhaps some Northern-European ones ([**Gotta love Sweden!**](http://www.trueactivist.com/sweden-runs-out-of-garbage/)), have even come close to actualising this idea. 

As for today's Greece, forget it. Concepts like *recycling* are beyond most Greeks' ability to even understand, let alone apply in practise. Oh they might talk about it, especially politicians, and pretend to understand why it's important etc. But they don't actually ""*get it*"", not really. 

It's like what a friend of mine (who had been with MSF in Zimbabwe) said about how it is to talk in cntral Africa about why ""*democracy*"" is important. ""*They know some basic platitudes to say to humour us, but they don't actually seem to understand anything about it*"" she said. Well, it's the same with Greeks and recycling. And because the whole thing flies over their head, they think that those who are in favour of it are being ""*naive*"" to use the more polite term.

There you have it. But how could Greeks have gotten so far back and so *low-minded* so to speak, especially after such a illustrious history? Well, this has been the subject of many debates. 

One theory is that like all peoples who have been slaves too long (first of Rome and then of the Ottomans), Greeks lost that sense of *responsibility* that characterises free men. The mind of a slave only need think about how to survive, do as little as possible, to get/steal as much as possible and how to get away with stuff. He feels no responsibility nor gives a fuck about the society around him. After a enough generations of this, one only understand bribes and threats and becomes incapable of *ethical* thought.

*Intellectually*, though the language is different, you'll have better luck finding the descendants of the Hellenes among people named  something like ""*Bengt  Samuelsson*"" than ""*Evangelos Venizelos*"" (actual name ""*Evangelos Turkoglu*"").

Obviously you don't. Genocide, from gens [family] and cidere [killing], refers to acts that are meant to destroy in whole or in part a (perceived) ethnic group. Usually this group is made out to be a pest, a threat or both. 

Mass-murder for profit like the Belgians did in Kongo Vrijstaat and the British in British India isn't genocide. The goal was not to destroy a specific ethnic group.

Ah bon ? En quoi ?

J'ai l'impression que tu as une vision partielle de ce que sont les religions, basée sur des analyses biaisées de textes dont la plupart des croyants se foutent. La religion est un code intériorisé de traditions et de philosophies. C'est pour ça que souvent les convertis récents ont du mal à digérer ces codes de manière cohérente et partent dans tous les sens.

&gt; Le fait est qu'il n'y a pas de dieu. C'est facile à démontrer.

Pff. Pas ça stp. C'est impossible à démontrer. J'ai eu des profs brillants (maths physique) de la rue d'Ulm qui ont fait une meilleure démonstration de l'improbabilité du chaos que tu ne pourras jamais en faire.

Il y a un certain ordre dans ce mystère de la vie, plus de nombreux événements scientifiquement inexplicables, en particulier le pouvoir de l'esprit (par exemple l'effet placebo). Et au-delà de ces aspects concrets, il y a la question humaine de la liberté de l'individu dans le groupe proche, puis avec le reste de l'humanité.

Les livres religieux, qu'ils soient monothéistes ou polythéistes sont uniquement des synthèses ponctuelles de traditions philosophiques qui permettent des modes d'action et de pensée cohérents face à ces questions.

En particulier, la vision chrétienne, c'est que le monde est apparu (il n'a pas toujours existé, il y a eu un début), que l'être humain est libre et que parmi ses choix, il y en a de meilleurs que d'autres, et enfin que les vivants laissent une trace après leur mort, trace liée aux décisions qu'ils ont prises et à ce qu'ils ont pensé. Après, suivant les époques, ça a donné plusieurs religions très différentes, même au sein du catholicisme, avec pourtant le même bouquin à la base.

L'ancien Testament est une juxtaposition de textes allégoriques écrits dans plusieurs langues. Essayer de comprendre la vision qu'ils ont de Dieu avec ses textes sans en maîtriser les clés ne va pas te mener bien loin.

I barely even started reading it, and it was already pretty easy to find fault with it. I barely started reading it, and that part here is completely ludicrous if you know anything at all about what the Japanese did in China.

&gt;But getting closer to the sort of core of the Nuremberg-Tokyo tribunals, in Truman's case at the Tokyo tribunal, there was one authentic, independent Asian justice, an Indian, who was also the one person in the court who had any background in international law [Radhabinod Pal], and he dissented from the whole judgment, dissented from the whole thing. He wrote a very interesting and important dissent, seven hundred pages -- you can find it in the Harvard Law Library, that's where I found it, maybe somewhere else, and it's interesting reading. He goes through the trial record and shows, I think pretty convincingly, it was pretty farcical. He ends up by saying something like this: if there is any crime in the Pacific theater that compares with the crimes of the Nazis, for which they're being hanged at Nuremberg, it was the dropping of the two atom bombs. And he says nothing of that sort can be attributed to the present accused. Well, that's a plausible argument, I think, if you look at the background. 

Chomsky knows full well what they did, because he refers to it at the end, but that doesn't stop him from supporting that guy's argument that there wasn't ""any crime [...] that compares with the crimes of the Nazis"" except for the two atom bombs.",0,1388287620,null,0,1388295604,0,cecak7l,t3_1tnzeq,t1_cecak7l,t1_cea5dul,null,1427950052,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Some Italian music I really like:  
*Singer-songwriters*: [De Andrè](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSvQafXx0Eo); [Guccini](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wESXNoepO8E); [Battiato](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TyRHj4Ag34); [Vecchioni](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT4OWBis058); [De Gregori](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hca8-wqcVdU). Italy has a pretty strong *cantautori* tradition, the quality is very high, and the lyrics can show you the expressive potential of the Italian language.

*Pop*: I don't know much Italian pop, but I know you can't go wrong with [Battisti](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWhaKIcmnmI) (really just start from here, it's possibly the apex of Italian pop). Probably the best kind of music to learn Italian, simple but great lyrics, and not too many sound effects covering the words.

*Alternative music*: [this list on RYM](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/teardrop_/italiani_scoppiati__ovvero_tutta_litalia_che_non_viene_mostrata_al_telegiornale__/) lists pretty much most Italian alternative music of the last two decades. Afterhours and Marlene Kuntz are the most famous indie rock groups, while Perturbazione are a decent choice for indie pop. I particularly like Offlaga Disco Pax, but their lyrics might not make much sense outside Italian's political and cultural context.

Lyrics for all these artists are pretty easy to find on the Internet. If some English lyrics website does not have them, try to replace ""lyrics"" with ""testo"" in the string search.

After some quarters of ruckus that the public debt could spiral out of control the government is trying to tackle it with some sort of light austerity, mainly by increasing revenue, this will be timid since there are general elections next year, after the election probably some of the spending will be curtailed, as a measure to balance the debt and to lower inflation, since the years of good growth are a thing of the past it's the only thing to be done.

I think Brazil will languish for some years but the sporting events will hardly be the cause of it.

Chauvinism is an exaggerated form of patriotism, where you would blindly defend all the actions of your country. That's not good at all, you should always question authority and the way your country is runned. And if they are up to something bad, well don't show them any support then. The patriotism I'm talking about is the one you find in sports, arts, literature, music, culinary, architecture, history etc. and is something that you can be more or less supportive of. Simply put, it's a way of saying that we as a group of people are up to something good here, that we feel secure and confident in doing. Other people can still join us, and contribute in their on ways.

The strenght in different cultures identities is also why it's so much divergencies around the world, and also why it's so exciting travelling and experience other peoples way of doing things. 

I would say that it's always two sides of these kind of things. There's good patriotism, and there's bad patriotism.

Viruses reproduce by inserting their genes into host cells, so if scientists take out the virus's genetic material and replace it with a gene that they want to insert into a cell, viruses can perform genetic engineering.  This can also be used to fight disease.  [Example](http://news.discovery.com/human/health/hiv-used-to-fight-cancer-110914.htm)

What about all the people today who vote for socialists and social democrats? Would these people also support a policy change that they have never supported for no god-damn reason? Anyway, even if any of those was true people would be forced to live with the consequences of their decisions and would be very quickly able to educate themselves on the issue. Which is partly my point. Currently allowing delegates to decide for you gives an incentive to avoid learning the issues and listening to the easy populist rhetoric of politicians. If you were forced to live with the consequences of your decisions, you wouldn't take things so lightly. 

&gt; Also, Switzerland has canton and federal representatives, popular mandated laws are relatively uncommon compared to such parliamentary legislation, and even then lead to stupid things like a federal minaret ban.

The minaret ban is such a stupid example to oppose direct democracy. Parliaments all over the world pass bigoted discriminatory laws all the time. But one time it's done democratically and everyone loses their minds. The solution to this problem has already been discovered: You can have a constitutional court that checks if laws are constitutional. Most constitutions have human rights clauses enshrined and that will hardly change with direct democracy. The example you offered is more of a failure of Switzerland's system of checks and balances than a failure of the principle of direct democracy.

I never had any bad experiences with doctors in Germany. I am German and moved abroad a couple of years ago. German doctors are one of the things I really miss because I experienced a couple of problems with doctors in other countries. Thanks to a dentist in the Netherlands one of my nerves had to be removed so I ended up with a dead tooth - no fun. 
I also found that the health insurance in Germany covers pretty much everything so I hardly ever had to pay anything on top. 

The only thing that truly annoyed me was (or is) that you have to go to the pharmacy to get pain killers and can't just pick them up from the supermarket. 

When it comes to doctors and their performance I never made any bad experiences. Some doctors were better than others but since I could choose freely that was no big deal either.

However, I do find convincing the idea that (as far a circumstances affect disposition), the sense of responsibility that characterises ethical thought requires one to be free. Slaves can seldom afford to be concerned about  matters beyond their own selves, their assigned tasks and perhaps their family. Free self-determined men, on the other hand, do need to  consider matters in terms of the welfare of their whole society. Because if they don't worry about it themselves, nobody else will. 

In any case, Swedish behaviour reflects ethical responsibility, much more than Greek behaviour does. But that's the thing: The Hellenes  basically invented ethical responsibility (along with philosophy, politics and most sciences). And Northern tribes (like the  Swedes) used to be considered* completely barbaric. Today, Sweden is a pinnacle of civilisation and Greece like a hundred years behind them.

I suspect the German healthcare system of playing a part in this. Doctors are paid a flat rate for specific illnesses. The shorter and cheaper their treatment is, the more money they make. If they really take their time to investigate and prescribe a lot they're actually losing money. Seems like just listening for one minute and prescribing nothing gives the best financial results. This way you can ""treat"" a really big number of patients a day.

But there's something I had happen that's contrary to this theory. Even if I offer to pay for stuff myself often doctors show no interest and just tell me to do nothing and wait till the condition get's really bad.

true,oroboros74,sicilia,null,"&gt; I cannot hear a difference

It's a subtle difference when spoken normally, just like the difference between pronouncing ""the white house"" and ""the White House"". It is about what syllable is stressed. 

In Italian, most words have the second- or third-to-last syllable stressed (which is why Italian sounds so sing-songy!); however, if the last syllable is stressed you must write it with the accent on that last vowel, which will also be the last letter of the word (like in città, caffè, metà). 

Just as a side note, some words have the accent to distinguish one word from another (like si/sì, la/là, etc). 

Remember: qui and qua (both words meaning ""here"") are exceptionally not written with an accent.",0,1388314697,null,0,false,0,cechr7i,t3_1tx41h,t1_cechr7i,t1_cecbvcf,null,1427946418,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

true,Logothetes,GREE,Greece,"&gt;*First, it's a bit unsubstantiated (unless you add more recent events than Ottoman subjugation as part of the cause for the ""mind of the slave"" effect)*.

That's a strong point. If there is indeed the ""slave-effect"" at play, it  should have worn off after a generation, shouldn't it? But it seems to somehow perpetuate itself.

&gt;*For the better part of the last century freedom has (unfortunately) become synonymous with pursuing one's self interest even at the detriment of the community.* 

Oh, I disagree but it would wake way to long to get into it beyond perhaps saying that self-interest and community-interest mus not necessarily conflict. They usually actually enhance each other. Of course they can and do sometimes conflict. What then? Well,  legal safeguards must be placed to protect individuals from mob-mentalities.

&gt;*All the talk about pinnacles of civilisation, past or modern, is necessarily romanticised. While I love a lot of things Sweden is doing now and I love a lot of things that were invented in ancient Greece, would call neither ""a pinnacle of civilisation"".*

That's fine but whenever I search for societies that excel, as compared to others of their times (the only meaningful comparison), Ancient Greece back then and Sweden today seem to consistently pop-up. So what else to do? If you can think of comparatively better societies than those two, that'd be even better!

&gt;*You question assumes that there's a direct lineage between ancient Greece and modern Greece. The area has been conquered and re-conquered, configured and re-configured a ton of times since then. Comparing the two is comparing apples to oranges. It's not so much decadence as just two different societies with only a few salient characteristics connecting them.*

Undoubtedly! 

But the question is nonetheless still interesting, isn't it?

Anyway, it's impossible to judge medical cases here. The healthcare in Germany works. Patients are not getting pampered here, for sure. If you want that special treatment, there is always the private insurance. Then you are a customer than can be milked for money and be treated as such.

Your society is based on principles of solidarity, efficiency, common sense and discipline, which makes for a capitalistic society without the unwanted externalities other countries have.

Also, I think modern day Dutch progressiveness is inspired by the Scandinavian model, more danish than Swedish but you still wrote the book on modernity with regard to human decency.

I go beyond specific modern day labels, what we view as ""modern"" was ""progressive"" liberalism/capitalism 60-70 years ago. Defining tendencies as progressive vs conservative allow you to look at history in a unified way.

* [VAT scandal protest](http://www.politics.hu/20131228/opposition-mps-join-protest-in-support-of-former-tax-official-who-alleges-fraud/) happened. Meanwhile the [tax authority refused to release the findings](http://www.politics.hu/20131228/tax-office-denies-request-for-report-on-probe/) of its alleged self-screening that happened over the weekend the week the story first broke. This is an organization with over 20.000 employees, so it's totes plausible that their screening was 100.000% legit, right?

* Reporters Without Borders featured [PM Orbán in their 2013 spot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GVInDRlYZA) along with many dictators and heads of states of questionable standings. Fidesz was not happy about it. Bonus content from the Fidesz-fan commenters of YouTube if you care to read some more.

* More humor: nationalists (""Bikers with Nationalist Feelings"") staged a protest in front of the Austrian Embassy because of the three Austrian humorists mocking the Holy Crown on Austrian national TV earlier this month. Their ""demands"" and statements are hilarious (sadly no English source):
&gt;
&gt; The Holy Crown of Hungary is the depository of world truth, as acknowledged by the Pentagon. It is of sacral personage, which suffered a brutal and vandal attack in Austria.
&gt; 
&gt; Reports say Austrian viewers were hitting their knees from laughter, so they demand a government apology, not just from the comedians.
&gt; 
&gt; If this does not occur, Romanians and Slovaks will be too courageous and God knows what happens then.
&gt; 
&gt; If they do not apologize, they will make life hell for Austrian farmers owning Hungarian land. Which is by the way the modern age Mongol invasion. 
&gt;
&gt; In closing they wished a nice, happy, good day to Hungarians and Siberian colds and unheated flats to Austrians.

* The ""debtors village"" of Ócsa, a housing complex built in the middle of nowhere for people who lost their homes due to CHF-based loan mortgages was a total failure for the government, who managed to build 80 homes for 2.5b HUF, just about 6 times over the market price. Only 55 families moved there, because the location and facilities are so shit and they didn't account for the notorious immobility of the people (most would rather pay rent or hope for a miracle than to move from the place they consider home). The namesake village is actually 5km away and they need to cross one of the busies highways of the country to get there. The houses have no gas, they are heated by wood, the storage attic is inaccessible from within the house, only from the outside by using a ladder. This was done to mimic peasants' houses in the 19th century, because fuck functionalism. They have a single grocery store for their needs. Now as to fix the lack of use, they are proposing to use the empty houses as reserve temporary shelters for victims of natural catastrophes in the future.",0,1388319274,null,0,1388322619,0,cecibz6,t3_1txr6n,t1_cecibz6,t3_1txr6n,null,1427946149,24,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,24

Présence protestante a été créée en 1955 pour être précis. À l'époque, c'est pas comme si les autres religions étaient représentées dans la population.

&gt;et que ça n'a été que par souci d'équité qu'ils en ont programmé à propos des autres religions

C'est le principe de base de la laïcité : impartialité envers les différentes religions.

&gt;La motivation primaire est donc de présenter la messe. Et les autres émissions ne sont là que pour les couvrir et éviter qu'on leur pose des questions du genre La France est un pays laïque – Pourquoi la messe sur France 2 ?

Ce n'est pas exactement la même chose, il n'y a rien ""à créer"" pour la messe, il suffit de filmer un événement qui existe déjà avec ou sans télé. Les autres, il y a des reportages, 

Je trouve que Présence Protestante est très bien foutue. Avec l'explication de la culture, de l'influence du protestantisme etc. C'est tout à fait cohérent avec une mission de service public. Les autres émissions, ça doit faire 10 ans que je ne les ai pas regardées.

&gt;En suivant la même logique, ils pourraient (et devraient) finir par programmer une émission d'athéisme…

true,globaltyler,GERM,Germany until further notice,"Mass-murder for profit is not genocide? So the Jews gassed in Auschwitz are genocide victims (as long as they were poor) but the Jews worked to death for IG Farben and all the other German companies or the rich Jews that got their property stolen were not. That's the result of your definition.

Because you can bet your ass on the fact that a lot of people made a killing (sorry for the pun) with the holocaust industry. And I am also pretty sure that most of those people had no will to destroy the Jews as a whole or anything, they wanted to make a lot of money.

And your definition also means that I can commit mass-murder and kill half of an ethnic group, as long as I just want profit because I know they are rich, it's not genocide.

But if I proclaim loudly that I want to kill said ethnic group because they are rich and that I want to make profit, that's genocide. Even though the effect is the same.

To sum it up: your definition of genocide is far too narrow as you place too much stress on the intent to destroy whole or parts of an ethnic group. Just because the main motivation for mass murder committed against an ethnic group is greed does not mean that the general intent to destroy said ethnic group is not included in the context. Especially when talking about colonialism. it cannot exist without the intent to not just rule but ""educate"" the ""savage"" and ""underdeveloped"" nations/ethnic groups, to ""root out"" their ""wild"" and ""uncivilized"" ways and bring them ""the light of civilization"".

Wanting to make a profit and wanting to tell other people what to do go hand in hand in colonialism. It's not just the gold that brings the Spanish to the Americas, it was the fact that there were ""heathens"" to convert. Or with the British, the Dutch, the Belgians, the French, the Germans, the Japanese and all their colonies in Africa, East Asia, America, Australia, China.
They go there to make money. But they also go there because they say that the native culture, the native society is wrong, is unworthy and savage, that the gods those people worship are wrong, that they (the colonial powers) are superior and are elected (by god) to rule the savages and that they need to use force to bring those to the light of civilization for their own good.

So I say that the intent on destroying an ethnic group is always embedded into any kind of colonialism. All it needs is the mass murder to occur and we have genocide.",0,1388321571,null,0,false,0,cecimsz,t3_1tw8z4,t1_cecimsz,t1_cec9c8i,null,1427946008,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

There are known issues in the German healtchare system.

1. The main one is demographics. Like it or not, Oma and Opa are now the typical patient and enjoy monopolizing the GPs time for some additional socialization. 

2. There is a shortage of GPs as well as a general shortage of every kind of doctor in remoter areas. (I study in a healthcare related field). That leads to overbooking of doctors.

There are other issues which I think the German public might not be quite as aware of due to not being exposed to other healthcare systems as much:

3. Lack of triage at the doctor's offices. It's ridiculous that the receptionist can let a person in clear pain sit for hours while the entire senior citizenry get to have a checkup first. (That happened to me earlier this year). 

4. Lack of time spent with patients. If the health insurances would provide a monthly breakdown of what your doctor charged them for, you would probably have a heart attack at the amounts of time and counseling your doc supposedly gave you. I have had 2 mistaken diagnoses in the space of a year, which would both have been avoided with a less rushed appointment.

5. The bureaucracy and lack of transparency. Germans like to lord it over government-run systems by saying there is less bureaucracy in the German system. That's because it is all hiding in the health insurance complex. 

6. That whole homeopathy bullshit just drives me nuts.

Most constitutions have human rights clauses enshrined and that will hardly change with direct democracy.

The thing is, that is a constitutional amendment! The only check and balance to stop that is requiring parliamentary privilege on constitutional amendments.

Industries are fine if you make the environment predictable and make assets like labor and capital accessible end productive, also because of the aging population the 60-80's standard of large scale industry and employment is ineffective in the long run, large companies will always prefer and old experienced worker to a new graduate, and retirement is unhealthy psychologically when you have a life expectancy of 80+ years. So a return to '70s welfare is unprovable but your national cohesion does allow you to experiment with new forms of capitalism, and you soulnd take the anglosaxon plutarchy as a model, it's also unhealthy.

I don't think slashed is the right term, managed and restructured would be my approach.

Yes it does cause confusion, but its a reminder that social reform or economical liberalism are not new inventions, since history society has changed and ideas for a better life have replaced fear driven conservatism.

Speaking only for Romania* , during the communist time the ""smart"" people were appreciated more, in schools the smart kids were the cool kids. There were the so called ""olympics"" in every class ( maths, physics, geography etc) and having someone win one at a school/town/county level was a pride for the whole class/school. The teachers/professors had a tighter competition between themselves to get better students, better results in schools competitions resulting indirectly in a better education. This all comes from the human nature to compete/show off . Due to the total isolation of the common people during the last years of communism in Romania (to an almost North Korean level) the intellectual show off was the only way to go. After the fall of the isolation Romania was flooded by a HUGE wave of information, bigger than everything else we had all hitting at once a relatively ""naive"" population, a Ponzi scheme game , Caritas, had maybe half of the Romanians as victims few years after revolution, a con-game that was known in the west for a hundred years. In this conditions the ""ghetto culture"" became an easier, faster way to show off trough money and bling. This combined with the adversity the common man had at the time for everything that was related to the communism resulted that after 15-20 years since the revolution a mentality of being cool by avoiding education, by getting ""around"" the system and the fact that the people working and studying hard are the ""loosers/suckers"" resulted in the conditions of today where the smarter, more educated people tend to be really frustrated with this situation and try to escape from it in the places, like the west, where their hard work and education will be rewarded.

true,astrobe,Normandie,Normandie,"&gt; C'est le cas actuellement. Il n'y a aucune raison de toucher aux lois sur le harcèlement.

De même qu'il n'y a aucune raison de toucher aux lois limitant la liberté d'expression. Les propos racistes, antisémites et négationnistes révulsent toute personne qui n'est pas atteinte de genre de maladie mentale.

&gt;  Absolument :
&gt; Le harcèlement est un enchaînement d'agissements hostiles dont la répétition affaiblit psychologiquement l'individu qui en est la victime.

Ce qu'il faut lire dans cette définition est qu'il s'agit d'agissements hostiles mineurs, difficilement répréhensibles en eux-même en pratique, mais dont l'accumulation a le but ou l'effet de nuire.

Ce ne peut remplacer en termes de protection les lois contre la diffamation. Il est assez aisé de harceler en s'associant secrètement par exemple. Chaque jour une diffamation par une personne différente. Ajoutez une touche de subtilité et un brin de machiavélisme. Ce genre de scénario est possible parce que ta logique est incohérente.

&gt;&gt;  La zoophilie étant interdite, il s'agit d'une accusation grave au sens de la loi et il est normal que la loi m'en protège.
&gt; ""Il est normal"" n'est pas un argument. 

Par ""normal"" j' entends évidemment ""logique"". Faire semblant de ne pas le comprendre relève de la foi.

&gt;  Ça relève donc de la dénonciation calomnieuse et donc aucun rapport avec la diffamation.
&gt; Cherche un autre argument.

non, je vais me permettre d'insister dessus au contraire: les deux notions sont tellement sans rapport qu'elles sont quasiment synonymes dans l'usage courant.

&gt; Pour se suicider, il faut être cliniquement malade (dépression) et ne pas se soigner (même si, à l'époque, je ne sais pas si les traitements existaient). Rien à voir avec les propos de diffamation. S'ils étaient répétés, ça relevait du harcèlement.
&gt; Toujours pas besoin de diffamation en droit.

Bien sûr, rien à voir. Quand on est dépressif et qu'on se fait diffamer, on va tout de suite mieux. Ne pas savoir qu'une dépression peut rester longtemps non diagnostiquée est pardonnable, mais faire semblant d'ignorer qu'il y des circonstances qui l'aggrave est encore de la pure mauvaise foi.

Dans tout les cas rejeter des dispositions dont le but est protéger des personnes dans des situations de détresse dont elles ne sont pas responsable témoigne soit d'un déficit inquiétant de la capacité d'empathie soit d'une naïveté sidérante quant aux aléas de la vie.

&gt; &gt; On en serait réduit à ""c'est celui qui parle le plus fort qui gagne"". Est-ce vraiment ce que tu veux?
&gt; Oui. Je préfère ça à ""c'est celui à qui on a donné le droit de parler qui gagne"".

""C'est celui à qui on a donné le droit de parler qui gagne"" n'est pas une caractérisation juste. La censure qui est la conséquence des limitation de la liberté d'expression frappe d'interdiction certains propos, et non des personnes. Passons.

Toujours est-il que cet avis ne m'étonne absolument pas étant donné ton ""style"" de discussion. Si je comprend bien ton point de vue, tu es partisan de la loi du plus fort. Je pense que le jour où tu trouveras en position de faiblesse et sans recours, tu reconsidéreras ce point de vue.
Cela me rappelle l'histoire de ce chroniqueur financier qui ne cessait de pointer du doigt les coûts dans le secteur de la santé publique. Jusqu'au jour où il a été sauvé par le SAMU. Il n'a certes pas changé radicalement d'opinion, mais celle-ci s'est quand même faite plus modérée.

Cette position est du reste encore en contradiction avec le fait de pointer les abus de pouvoir des ""médias détenus par [certains propriétaires]"". A moins que je n'aie mal compris et que tu t'en félicites ou que tu trouves que cela est juste.

&gt; Non. Mon argument est qu'il n'y a pas de liberté d'opinion si tout le monde ne peut pas dire ce qu'il pense

Pouvoir dire tout ce que l'on pense est peut-être une condition suffisante pour la liberté d'opinion, mais ce n'est pas une condition nécessaire. En fait la liberté d'opinion n'est soumise à aucune condition si on entend ""liberté"" au sens de non-restriction. Si on entend par ""liberté d'opinion"" la possibilité de se former des opinions, alors effectivement la limitation de liberté d'expression limite mécaniquement (dans une certaine mesure) la ""liberté d'opinion"" si on considère que l'on a besoin des avis des autres pour se former des opinions.
Cependant les restrictions que les français (mais pas seulement) s'imposent (par le biais de ces représentants) ont pour but, fondamentalement,  de les protéger contre la diffusion d'opinions fausses et néfastes. 

Soutenir qu'il n'y a pas de liberté d'opinion parce que la diffusion des opinions qui ont pour but de nuire est interdite est simplement manichéen et myope.

&gt; Il existe d'autres lois pour les cas où l'intégrité physique ou juridique est menacée.  Il ne devrait dans les autres cas y avoir aucune conséquence.

The majority of those foreigners are from Eastern European countries. Really clever people who could come here because of the easier Visa since 2011 (IIRC). Are those guys going to go back to their country once they finished their studies? Probably not. They will stay in Germany and work here. The point is that people always pull this nationalistic ""But Germans will lose German workplaces because of some non-German Bulgarians"" (""German"" can be changed with any other country in Europe since this think-process is everywhere) card but they seem to forget the obvious benefits from this change. THose students study in Germany and who knows if they are ever going back to their countries. But if they do they will transfer their knowledge back to Bulgaria/Romania and the whole country might benefit from them in the long-run.  Human capital flight is probably bad in the short-run for those countries but for Germany? The people who go to Germany don't spend their whole savings for a One-Way-Flight only to be homeless and uneducated here. The (right) media in Germany always tries to induce fear because for some reason a society needs a common enemy.(and for EU-member states those are usually Africans and East-Europeans).
The problem with Brain-Drain is that it's not only one-sided. Many people have this urge to return home after a while and most people usually do. A good example for this could be the Italian who left for America in the 20s but came back once they made some money improving their region's knowledge and capital. This human capital isn't leaving Europe. It's simply relocating and it will relocate again once a certain market is ""full"". When Germany and France aren't going to be #1 anymore immigrants will look for other opportuninites. Spain, Italy and Portugal might finally realize that immigrants aren't bad and they might stop sinking boats full of Africans in the ocean which will eventually lead to better chances for immigrants in those countries.  
People should stop thinking of eastern European people as some primitive natives who can neither write nor speak. Sure the educational level is (way) lower than Germany's but the brightest Bulgarians are as clever as the brightest Germans.

That's not really an achievement which deserves praise, it's more of an attempt of damage control. Had the Belgians deposed and imprisoned the guy, that would've been something else.

But your first point is true it was not ""the Belgians"" that did it, they just stood idly by as it happened and only intervened when it became to big too ignore.

I didn't say that, though I thought that people will make this mistake. I'm arguing that making naked calendar is roughly the same as wearing stitched/patched trousers. Would you open an account at a bank where the manager wore unkempt patched pants? Now you might say that wearing patched trousers is not necessarily correlated with incompetency as human intelligence can be very specific, but I'd argue that these blunders (i.e. patched trousers or naked calendars) nonetheless posses non-zero weight when judging overall competency as these blunders demonstrated lack of thought and if that individual or organisation missed that obvious blunder then you can't be sure their services or products you will be reviving wouldn't be full of less than obvious blunders and deficiencies. Or in short - naked calendar does not demonstrate lack of competency indirectly, but it does demonstrate lack of professional carefulness.

If you didn't know, medical treatment at post med centers is strictly space available with priorities to soldiers and then their families with private contractors at the bottom of the list.  We are an older couple with a teen daughter, we all had various significant medical problems while there and had no choice but the German medical system.  The German medical system, especially hospitals, is two tier: One for those in the public health system, and those with private insurance (which we had).  There was usually no difference between these when seeing local providers in their offices, but many of the newer hospitals actually have separate wings for public vs. private with the private often substantially better than care in most US hospitals.

There are significant differences between TLC in Germany and the US, and often different treatment approaches, although generally the German approach was actually better than the US.  If anything, often the German approach was more thorough, making use of any testing that could contribute to diagnosis and frequent referrals to specialists.  Generally we thought there was less BS in the German system, it was more efficient, and practiced to a higher standard.  Comparing diagnosis and treatment/care standards for our various med problems to US after our return confirmed we had quality and appropriate care in Germany.  Our biggest problems, as we do not speaking much German, centered on language and cultural barriers, even though most Germans at a professional level speak English, and it was a relief to be back home Stateside in that regard.

Comparing the German medical system to the US highlights the pros and cons of universal health care vs. private.  US healthcare cost is out of control and getting more so.  Obamacare is a poor band-aid on a very broken system.  The German system is far more rational.  Recent news in the US centers on how many people simply don't seek medical care here due to the expense.  Costs for procedures and services are grossly distorted compared to most other countries.  I'm sure you would have no trouble coming up with stories of bad medical care in the US that would trump anything in Germany.

German doctors are much more conservative treatment-wise than most in the US; you are unlikely to get an antibiotic unless they have actually confirmed you have an infection responsive to it, and you are much less likely to get a painkiller of any strength unless they've confirmed the reason for the pain, then only for a short-term.  They do, however, have a wider range of meds to use and at much lower cost due to differences in pharmaceutical marketing, drug company owned research, how civil liability cases are managed, and politics effecting drug regulations, all factors driving up the cost of US health care.  German medical providers are notorious for lack of bed-side manner, and, as in the US, there are certainly providers we would want to avoid.

true,ITALIANCOLOGNE,NRHW,"Italy and Germany - fuck yeah. ","Since nobody took the time to read the full poll, and for some reason the Guardian doesn't link to the study (kind of sad for a serious newspaper imho) I looked it up on their homepage. 
Here's also the full [PDF-document](http://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/attitudes-to-immigration-british-future-tables-2013.pdf) with all the relevant data which, again, for some reason wasn't part of the Guardian article. 
Besides the weird statement from Vince Cable about 75% GDP which for some reason is relevant to free movement or per capita GDP the article isn't accurate at all. 

Here's why:

&gt;Nearly half (45%) said that enforcing the minimum wage was one of the most important ways of stopping business undercutting British workers by paying European workers less. 

Nothing in the poll talks about this. In fact the question was slightly different: ""Enforce the minimum wage so businesses cannot undercut British workers""
Nothing talks about the ""past"" and rather that the UK **should** enforce a minimum wage **to** prevent immigrats from undercutting British workers. The difference is small but it completely changes the perception. The original question actually talked about actively combatting undercutting rather than an indirect by-product like the Guardian wrote it. 
One of the most scary things wasn't even presented in the article. I'm talking about the fact that only 8% of the 16-24 year olds are in favor of helping immigrants. All other demographics have 20% of agreement, 12 percent points difference, more than 100%. 

&gt;The polling also showed that, while a significant majority did want a tightening of the welfare system (63%)

This shows that the guy writing the article didn't read the questionaire. It was actually a ranking of several questions where the majority of the sample (n=2244) ranked it at #1 shortly followed by the ""minimum wage"" question on #2.  
This doesn't mean that 63% of the sample agreed with this statement. It means that out of the 4.543 answers given 1423 people agreed with that statement. In fact the original question was to pick 2 important questions, that's why the total answers (4543) are almost twice as much as the sample population.  From the original questions it's something like ~31%. Compared with the sample population however it's indeed 63% however that's a shitty way to measure it and the guy who read it probably knew about it.

&gt;just 2% of those asked believed that there was nothing migrants from Romania and Bulgaria could do to be accepted.

This is such a biased statement. Sure this is correct since 2% actually said that but 2% also said that they shouldn't have to do anything special. Pointing out the one answer just fits the Guardian's agenda. I understand that they don't like the government, I don't like Cameron either, but they should at least try to be somewhat objective. 

Last but not least the awesome title. 
The original question was: 
**Romanians and Bulgarians coming to Britain have got to learn the language, work hard and pay taxes, fit in and be part of the community. If they do that, we should welcome them to the UK**
Only this question got a 73% from people aged 35-44. Nowhere did they say ""yes"" to ""welcome immigrants"" per se. 
Now you might ask: Why did the Guardian choose the demographic 35-44 category? Well for one the answer was ""Top 2 box"" meaning that they added the votes for ""Strongly agree"" and ""Tend to agree"". For some reason ""Tend to agree"" means ""Hey boys, come over!"" but that's journalism in a nutshell. 
The reason why they choose this age group is because all other groups have -surprise, surprise- lower percentages. All groups besides ""35-44"" have lower numbers with 25-34 having the lowest with 63 and the total average being 68%. Not a bad average and it was named somewhere in the article but the title suggests something completely different.
The Guardian basically took a questions cut off some important words and added the highest percent number to make it look like 73%. And for some reason they managed to change the 73% into a 72%, whatever. 
The fact that they still called Cameron a populist (indirectly) even though these numbers show that it isn't ""popular"" to hate on immigrants is kind of sad.  All in all it's a pretty redundant poll since it tells nothing new. An uneducated youth that doesn't like immigrants. That's nothing new. This happens everywhere. Maybe Cameron should invest in education rather than passing bills to limit immigrants.

If you - more or less extreme - consider yourself to be part of one religion, you exclude people believing in other religions and probably think superior of your religion (otherwise you wouldn't believe in your religion, right?). That's chauvinism. You can also find a study [here](http://spp.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/04/25/1948550612444137.abstract) that pretty much proved that strong belonging to one group makes you less helpful to people outside of that group resp. that non-religious people show more compassion and and capability of empathy than religious people. 

I am pretty sure you can apply this to the patriotic views as well (""Why should I help this Roma guy?"").

But I agree with you that immigrants can (but certainly don't need to) feel patriotic. They might have deliberately chosen the country they went to and thus can be proud of their decision. If their home country is in some kind worse than their immigration country, they can be strong supporters of their new home country.

I don't see a reason to feel patriotic in sports, arts, literature, music, culinary, architecture, history or anything else. These are all completely arbitrary as well. Why should I feel a connection to those things that I didn't help to create? I am, again, lucky and not proud.

I don't really see a connection between patriotism and different cultures and lifestyles. Take the US for example where there is strong patriotism and people in Texas might live completely different to people in New York or California. I am a big fan of divergence as well - but I would argue you don't need patriotism for that divergence.

That's why patriotism is still inherently bad in my eyes.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Les propos racistes, antisémites et négationnistes révulsent toute personne qui n'est pas atteinte de genre de maladie mentale

La loi n'est pas là pour que les personnes sensibles ne soient pas choquées ou révulsées. Si je relate des discours de personnes historiques comme Jules Ferry sur l'inégalité des races, ce n'est pas illégal. Ça peut te révulser mais je n'en n'ai strictement rien à foutre.

&gt;Ce qu'il faut lire dans cette définition

Ce qu'il faut lire, c'est que tu as tort quand tu dis que la répétition n'est pas importante en droit.

&gt;Il est assez aisé de harceler en s'associant secrètement par exemple.  Chaque jour une diffamation par une personne différente.

Si les personnes sont associées, ça constitue une circonstance aggravante. Il est tout aussi aisé de prouver que des personnes ont une action coordonnée de harcèlement.

&gt;Ce genre de scénario est possible parce que ta logique est incohérente.

Ce genre de scénario est tout autant illégal que du harcèlement par une seule personne.

&gt;Par ""normal"" j' entends évidemment ""logique"". Faire semblant de ne pas le comprendre relève de la foi.

Il est logique n'est pas une démonstration. La loi n'est pas là pour s'occuper des petits tracas d'une minorité.

&gt;les deux notions sont tellement sans rapport qu'elles sont quasiment synonymes dans l'usage courant

Tu as parlé de diffamation sur de la zoophilie comme d'une ""accusation grave au sens de la loi"". Si c'est une accusation d'avoir commis un délit ou un crime, ça relève de la dénonciation calomnieuse, qui n'a rien à voir avec de la diffamation.

&gt;rejeter des dispositions dont le but est protéger des personnes dans des situations de détresse

Ce n'est absolument pas le but de la répression de la diffamation. Le but est de punir l'atteinte à l'honneur. Concentre toi sur les textes.

&gt;Je pense que le jour où tu trouveras en position de faiblesse et sans recours, tu reconsidéreras ce point de vue.

Au contraire, je considère que la justice est dans les faits la justice des puissants. Les plaintes en diffamation sont des moyens pour les puissants de faire taire leurs opposants. Personne chez les pauvres ne va aller payer un avocat à 100 euros de l'heure pour faire un procès en diffamation contre son voisin parce qu'il a dit que t'étais zoophile.

Par ailleurs, je suis membre d'un parti qui a été diffamé, diabolisé pendant des années par les puissants, dont les membres ont été traités comme des racistes, ou simplement comme des abrutis. Au final, on est toujours là. À l'heure d'internet et de la vérification, la diffamation est contre productive.

D'ailleurs, c'est marrant, la plupart des plaintes pour diffamation du FN sont en général déboutées, sous des prétextes flous comme [l'absence d'animosité personnelle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animosit%C3%A9_personnelle). Le journal Le Monde a menti en disant que JM Le Pen avait pratiqué la torture, mais comme par hasard, dans ce sens c'est toujours légal. Éva Joly a menti en disant que Marine Le Pen était ""l'héritière de son père milliardaire par un détournement de succession"", évidemment elle a [été acquittée](http://www.leparisien.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/candidats/diffamation-le-litige-joly-le-pen-examine-par-la-cour-d-appel-ce-samedi-21-04-2012-1965599.php).

**Quel est ton avis sur ces deux affaires ?**

&gt;Cette position est du reste encore en contradiction avec le fait de pointer les abus de pouvoir

En quoi ?

Si les médias n'avaient pas à faire face à tant de procès, il y aurait bien plus de place pour des médias indépendants.

&gt;Soutenir qu'il n'y a pas de liberté d'opinion parce que la diffusion des opinions qui ont pour but de nuire est interdite est simplement manichéen et myope.

Comme je te l'ai montré, la diffamation cherche à protéger les puissants et à faire taire les petits. Ça ne date pas d'aujourd'hui d'ailleurs :

In 2010 when the € was on an all time high with 1,40$ German car companies were concerned that the strong €  could hurt the exports. They asked an independent institute to make a study for them. Which came to the conclusion that the cars industry would have no problem with adopting to an even higher exchange rate (it was something near 2$). The explanation they gave was that their cost calculation showed that a strong € would make the production process cheaper, because most parts of a car need to get ""imported"".

They don't (have the money). They are a country that is on a crisis and implementing austerity measures, demanded (and rightly so) by the creditor countries.

The reason the discussion in Britain is stronger than in Germany is because we introduced no transitionary controls on the right to work. All citizens of 2004 accession countries were allowed to work in Britain without restrictions in 2004, whereas as you say, this was not true in Germany until 2011. There's quite a good data table on wikipedia about this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_for_workers#Transitional_provisions_in_new_member_states

British political leaders estimated that perhaps tens of thousands of people would move, but in reality, something between 800,000 and 1 million people arrived from the new accession countries, roughly equivalent to the entire population of Cyprus, one of the largest period of immigration in British history. There has been little antagonism towards the people who have moved, but there is also a general recognition that that level of immigration puts a lot of stress on social services, and also tends to undercut local wages and working conditions. It's not all that surprising that people are jumpy this time around, even if the situation is different, and it's very unlikely that the same level of migration will occur.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;They don't (have the money). They are a country that is on a crisis and implementing austerity measures, demanded (and rightly so) by the creditor countries. You can't come and say ""why don't you increase spending"" moments after making a speech on how debt is bad and how PIGS are fiscally irresponsible. It is an hypocrisy of the highest caliber.

They are a G7 country who most certainly have the money. And, I did not make a speech about the PIIGS (which I do not call them, you do btw which I think it is insulting of you, I have never done that), irresponsible debt or anything. I was calling for a G7 country to act upon something threatening the whole of the world. Poorer countries in South America  is fighting it btw,so finances are not really the first issue here. 

But the fact is, as I suspected, you have very little knowledge about this. So, instead of arguing with me under your real redditname where you might expose yourself as ignorant and get downvotes, you choose to say that I use racial slurs. The only thing you have prove is that you have no arguments. 

The fact that you claim that G7 countries do not have the money, means that you have no basic clue about economics, but more - how have to have extensive knoweldge about how to fight resistant strains. 

It is not expensive *not* to overdose on antibiotics. In fact, it saves money. First for the state that do not have to sponsor the medicine, and then second, because people/strains will be less resiststant. Swedes spend less on medicine that France and Belgium  for example, but fight a  better fight against antibiotics than they do. And, that fight goes under our health budget and we are one of the top 10 in the world. If it was so expensive, it would show up in the budget, but it doesn't. So, it is cost effective. Not that you care, that is facts, and you just rather accuse me of being a racist than dealing with facts.  


&gt;You are asking me for my personal information.

No, for your reddit information. 


&gt;I don't, because you seem like the crazy type.

I am not the one making troll accounts where you make stuff up things I say. I do not call anyone sandniggers or PIIGS, you do. Is that normal to you? It is not expensive not giving *non necessary medicine*, yet you make up arguments I have never made. You are crazy. 

But above all, you are such a fucking coward. You are so afraid of bad karma that you do not dare to discuss with me under your real *reddit* name, because you might loose a point or two. 

And, it is not just me you attack. You go in and makes statements, statements that is blatantly racist. About the US, about a lot of places and people. You claim it is because you do not want to loose karma, and you are afraid of me, but it is you that are making the racists statements, not me. 

So, at least try to be somewhat honest. Yu are such a coward that you do not dare to loose karma nor do you want people to know what a racist you are. 

And, if you are so afraid, why make troll accounts at all?

The title is misleading in that it's not about US companies, but equipment for which the NSA has tailored hard- and software exploits. Most of those companies happen to be US based, but that's because US companies tend to be rather dominant in network equipment. It also lists Samsung HDDs, for example.

I would trust non-US companies a bit more, because we can assume that it would be easier for the NSA to gain access to internal documents from US based companies, either through some form of ""national security letter"" or because American employees would be more willing to cooperate with them, but it *seems* as if those companies don't cooperate with the NSA in a way that is known or has been decided by upper management (i.e., there probably aren't any top-down directives to intentionally install back doors).

It's also not exactly trivial to break into those markets. There's a lot of know-how involved; it's not as if European companies could just decide to manufacture state of the art products from one day to the next. This takes years and a lot of R&amp;D. Still, it's probably good for the companies already present in the relevant markets, and it's an opening for those who want to be.  

Getting engineers with the relevant knowledge is difficult by itself. Take high-end network equipment, for example. To do write software for this, you need developers that are trained to work in an entirely different manner than the rest of the industry. Normally, software if written around maintainability, but those guys write for performance above all, and very specific to the hardware they use.

Brigden is right, but for the wrong reason. UKIP is pretty strongly opposed to free movement of labour and rights for asylum seekers as it stands. Farage is simply trying to present a more ""humanitarian"" face of UKIP to try and win votes. The fact that he gives no details as to how his plan for Syrian refugees is supposed to work is evidence enough that it's not really sincere and thought through.

However, [here are some examples of the policies that UKIP does advocate](http://www.ukip.org/issues/policy-pages/immigration) for asylum seekers when it's not trying to make the headlines:

* All aslyum seekers would have to be held in secure units, have a minimum five-year wait for citizenship with no rights to benefits.
* UKIP would also withdraw from the European Convention of Human Rights, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Refugees. As it stands these charters streamline the process for asylum and accord asylum seekers some rights.

But the point stands that after it became known nothing happened except damage control.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not holding that specifically against Belgium, that was a problem with the system.

true,Albator78,ZZZZZZpingouin,Pingouin,"Petit historique de la numérotation des chaînes en France:

Jusque dans les années 1980 il n'y avait que trois chaînes, toutes publiques: TF1 (Télévision Française 1), Antenne 2, FR3 (France Régions 3).

En 1984, une quatrième chaîne est arrivée: Canal+, la première chaîne privée, qui était donc naturellement le numéro 4 sur la télécommande. C'était aussi la première chaîne payante, et partiellement cryptée.

Ensuite est arrivée ""La Cinq"", le pire du pire qu'a jamais connu la télévision française. La Cinq était la percée de la télévision privée italienne en France (groupe Berlusconi), et a introduit les coupures publicitaires pendant les programmes, chose qui n'existait pas en France jusqu'alors, ainsi que la rediffusion en boucle de séries de piètre qualité. La Cinq a quitté les écrans français en 1991, mais le mal était, le ver était dans la pomme et le reste des chaînes a suivi dans la quête d'audience et du plus petit dénominateur commun.

Le canal numéro 5 sera ensuite occupé par la chaîne publique ""La cinquième"", chaîne généraliste à vocation éducative.

TF1 a été ensuite privatisée en 1987, suivant la dynamique commerciale créée par la Cinq, ce qui explique l'esprit racoleur de la chaîne aujourd'hui.

La même année la chaîne commerciale Métropole Télévision est née, prenant ainsi le numéro 6 sous le nom de M6. C'était à l'origine une chaîne à dominante musicale.
De plus, 
Pendant que M6 était en préparation, la Sept, chaîne culturelle franco-allemande a été créée. Elle deviendra plus tard Arte.

Je ne sais pas exactement quand, mais les deux chaînes publiques restantes (Antenne 2 et FR3) ont à un moment donné changé de nom pour France 2 et France 3, formant ainsi le précurseur de France Télévisions.

Après la Sept/Arte, la numérotation des chaînes n'a plus vraiment de logique car c'est l'explosion du nombre de chaînes avec l'avènement de la télévision par câble et par satellite. En 2000 il est courant d'avoir 300 chaînes ou plus, et la numérotation 1, 2, 3, etc... n'a plus de raison d'être. En 2005 la France se débarrasse de l'analogique et la TNT (Télévision Numérique Terrestre) rend accessible à tous une cinquantaine de chaînes sans avoir besoin de souscrire un abonnement câble ou satellite.

De son côté le groupe public France Télévisions décide de renommer ses chaînes en 2002, et en plus de France 2 et France 3, on voit France 4 (anciennement Festival, chaîne satellitaire), France 5 (ex-""La cinquième), France Ô (anciennement RFO, qui desservait les DOM-TOM). La numérotation de France Télévisions devient donc interne au groupe plutôt que fonction des chaînes existant au niveau national.

Donc pour répondre à ta question concernant la numérotation et répartition des programmes du groupe France Télévisions:

* Il n'y a pas de France 1. La place est occupée par TF1, chaîne généraliste privée
* France 2: chaîne généraliste nationale publique
* France 3: chaîne régionale - les journaux télévisés sont spécificques à chaque région de France
* France 4: chaîne de divertissements
* France 5: chaîne géréraliste (dominante éducation/documentaires ?)
* France Ô: départements et territoires d'outre-mer

Étant un peu dans la même situation que toi (je regarde la télévision française de l'étranger), côté culture tu pourrais essayer [Arte](http://www.arte.tv) et [Arte Live Web](http://liveweb.arte.tv), [TV5 Monde](http://www.tv5.org) et si tu aimes la musique classique, [Medici](http://medici.tv). Ce sont les seules chaînes de langue française que je supporte :P, mais il y en a sans doute d'autres.
