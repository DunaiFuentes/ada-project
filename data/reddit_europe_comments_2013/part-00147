true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;If that is the goal the EU is probably doing something terribly wrong. 

The rural development is not the CAP, so yes they are unfortunately. That is why I keep nagging about a goal, time frame and a plan. 

&gt;. The EU don't want to grow dependent on international markets for food supplies. 

There is a lot to say about the CAP, but I agree with you that we need some sort of subsidies in case of war etc. However, those subsidies does not have to be 44 %, and most certainly do not have to sponsor stuff like wine, tobacco, tulips and other idiotic stiff. Furthermore, they should be fair. 

&gt;And it just seems these rural development subsidies go to places were a lot of agricultural activities are located

Becaue they are tailored incorrectly, of course. 


I am not against giving money to the EU, but the money ,and the projects have to have a goal, time fram, and evaluation. I mean - when is area X going to be developed? What do we want with the infrastructural money Spain receives? What is the goal? How many years until Portugal is a net contributor? Wouldn't we all love to see EU's take on that?

Yup! The EU really is a bit of a mess in that regard: ""this is a requirement, but not really, but it is, but some have opt outs, but it's all strictly voluntary, but not really, ..."" :-)

&gt; Despite ERM2 entry being voluntary Eurozone membership is still an accession criterion. Funny situation eh? I'd think a 15 year delay - where it is clear that the delay is politically motivated and not economic - would be sufficient to kick the offending state out of the EU.

The thing is, it could potentially be *both* political and economic. Even now, the economies of EU member states are quite heterogeneous when taken as a group. In fact, that very diversity was, by way of example, one of the reasons so much money ended up being pumped into the Irish economy from primarily German banks and why we ended up with interest rates meant to help Germany that were way too low for the Irish economy, both of which were major contributors to what ended up happening with our property bubble.

[In case it seems otherwise, I'm not blaming Germany for anything; it's just an example. Just because somebody hands you a gun, it doesn't mean you have to shoot yourself. And every country that has a bubble thinks its the exception.]

&gt; I recall reading on several occasions that Scotland would be ejected from the EU, need to re-apply as a new nation, and be forced to accept the Euro as all new applicants are.

And doing that would cause a host of difficulties given the size of the new nation's economic zone. Moreover, there's the issue of Scots living in EU member states. It'd be interesting to see if somebody actually tried to force something like that. I've a feeling it'd be a fiasco.",0,1374262045,null,0,false,0,cb65j5f,t3_1imf4r,t1_cb65j5f,t1_cb6560o,null,1430407519,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,angry_spaniard,ESPR,Delenda est euro,"&gt; Yes, so why are France still receiving those money? Shouldn't they go to Poland/Bulgaria etc?

Maybe, If you're talking about EU funds. However France should probably keep expending money in rural development because the french rural areas are less atractive than urban areas  without additional funding. The rural areas have improved in the last 40 years, but the urban areas have improved also. But, the rural areas are less competitive  than urban areas still. 

&gt; I am saying that the CAP is tailored after France's need. For example, why does a Swedish farmer receive less money for the exakt same cow. 

Citation needed.

&gt; If we need the CAP to survive, why in God's name are we then subsidising wine and tobacco?

*Rural development,* however the final product is heavily taxed. Actually, It's to protect local producers from imports. You can discuss the real point of the CAP


&gt;&gt;Not to mention other idiotic endevours, that should not receive the CAP, like tulips etc. Are you saying the CAP is sensible, completely tailored after all of the EU and that we need to give 44 % to the CAP? I do not think so.

No, I am not saying that. But, I say that we need a CAP.

&gt; I can't find it. I want to read the EU's plan for Spanish infrastructure and how they can connect the investments in it, to development,

I would love to know that also. However, the EU funds went to the projects that make sense.  The weird projects have been paid with our tax money or in the case of some airports with the money of regional saving banks.

For example Spain has proposed to built a tunnel in Pyrenees to connect to connect to the french rail freight transport network and the EU denied the funding to that and said that we should connect by Catalonia that is the cheapest solution. But, the spanish government is having a *weird* behaviour about investments in Catalonia(I am sure that will help with to fight the independence movement). 

About the central corridor. Only the tunnel would cost 6 billions. [Check the map](http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sociedad/gobierno-recupera-proyecto-del-corredor-central-por-aragon-1418021) Red line from *Zaragoza to Francia.*

&gt; and I of course, want to read the evaluation. It is not there. I want to read an evaluation of how giving CAP money to wine is ""food security"". It is not there.

There is some evaluation. They rejected the crazy spanish proposal and regional government from Aragon is angry about that.

&gt; What do you think it is wrong with demanding this? Why do you want to keep up the current situation?

I don't want to keep the current situation. My points are:

*  the rural areas are less atractives than urban areas without additional programs. I want to keep them alive.
* Food security is needed. I didn't say that I want to keep all the CAP funds and programs I say that I want to keep a CAP.
* You have said  things that you can't back with data, like that rural development programs have failed in France. The Rural GDP per capita is higher and the people living in rural areas have acceptable public services. It's not like Italy where the rural areas in the south are almost third world.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;owever France should probably keep expending money in rural development because the french rural areas are less atractive than urban areas without additional funding. The rural areas have improved in the last 40 years, but the urban areas have improved also. But, the rural areas are less competitive than urban areas still. But, France is *still* the biggest reipients. However, countries in Eastern Europe need it a lot more, so why does France even get any money? 

That goes for *every* single country in the EU, including Sweden, Denmark, Germany etc. *Far, far* more for Sweden, since we are far more rural - northern Sweden is really sparsely populated. 


&gt;Rural development

No, wines go under the CAP. In the former budget, 4 % of the total EU budget went to wine. It was mad. So, again, why do we need wine, tobacco and tulips.

Furthermore - those wine regions of France and Italy are *far, far* richer than regions in Bulgaria, Romania etc, so frankly, in a world where supply is limited - why are two G7 countries the biggest recipients? The development and support is far more needed and urgent in Eastern Europe.  


&gt;the rural areas are less atractives than urban areas without additional programs. I want to keep them alive.

I do too, but unlike you I do not accept status quo. I see no reason to think that the only way to keep them alive is endlessly subsidising them. Do you think the only way to keep things alive is by endlessly subsidising them? Why is that? 

I am not like you, I refuse to accept this accepting of endless sponsoring. At some point it has to change and stop 


In the same time that South Korea dragged itself out of poverty southern Italy hasn't changed. Do you really think our money is well spent there? Honestly, if I have to sponsor them for another 40 years, they should perhaps die out (some villages, not the Italians).




&gt; Citation needed.

Oh, how about the fact that the ""rural development"" that you are so fond of doesn't really apply to Sweden and Finland? Due to our population density 80 % of the countries would be eligeble, and we would drain the funds. So, we do not get it on the same premises as France or Italy. They have areas that are far more inhibited that Swedish areas, that receive more money 

Or, do you want me to write an essay why Swedish farmers receive less money for the exact same cow? I'll do it, but you will get it on Sunday. 

Or, why, if the CAP is tailored for survival in case of food shortage, have we included wine at all? Not the idea of the Brits, I can tell you that.

&gt;However, the EU funds went to the projects that make sense.

How do you know that? Citation needed that they were the best investments. *If* they had evaluated I would have believed you, but now it is just that they make sense to you.

For me however, they might not. Infrastructure for me is also IT and stuff. Perhaps, at least to me, more of those money should have been invested in that, and research around it. We will never know who is right, because the EU, against everything that makes sense, refuses to evaluate. 

&gt;You have said things that you can't back with data, like that rural development programs have failed in France. 

No, I say that *if* one has a rural *development* program that is still in effect after 40 years, that program has  failed. Obviously, if one still needs the program after 40 years, one hasn't developed. And, it might have worked in France as you point out - they are quite prosperous. Shouldn't they stop receiving then? Shouldn't other countries get their chance. And why hasn't Italy changed. If a program is a failure (obviously, in Italy) it stops. Rather simple. Or, it is simple for sensible governments who care about the tax payers money. Not for the EU

Otherwise, if you want to make it permanent, call it the rural *support* program. 

Furthermore, like I have pointed out before it is a real risk with making programs like that perment. If region X knows that no matter what they do, they will still receive money, why develop? They might even risk loosing the money, so obviously the make sure that they don't. That passivisation, refusal to develop, letting other fix things for you is a real problem in the aid world to third world countries (some African economists have a real interesting  take on it, read it) and more and more are saying that the aid has to stop, or at the very least change. 

It most definately seem to be the case in the EU. That is also why it is *vital* that we have a time frame, and an evaluation. For example - wouldn't we all be better off if we knew what went wrong in southern Italy. Also, you might want to pay for them for the next 40 years, but I do not. Therefore, things have to change. The EU is however doing nothing to change it. Why should they get my money when they can't even tell me what went wrong and how they are going to fix that? 

If my money goes to the EU I want them to present sensible projects, with goals, time frames, and evaluation. I honestly do not think that is to much to ask, and I am chocked that so many people seem to hate it. If they can't do that, they are not worthy of anyones money. I am sad that you seem to think otherwise. ",0,1374263765,null,0,false,0,cb6692o,t3_1imeum,t1_cb6692o,t1_cb65jlg,null,1430407180,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Here the part where you or they are twisting things : They aren't. They don't pay *any* taxes in fiscal paradises. *Which is probably why it's called a fuckin tax heaven.*

They are just stuffing money under the mattress for ever and ever. Outside of occident or anyone else reach.

&gt;  I have friends that work at Google, at Amazon, at Facebook. They make great salaries. 

Don't get me wrong. I *love* Google and Amazon. They are great companies. The first having brought insanely advanced technology and the second culture and knowledge at the level of everyone.

But please look at the bigger pictures. They workers wages are *a fraction of the money they amass*. Google does invest a ton in projects, which is probably why they got a pass for so long. 

But a number of big companies (\*cough\* apple \*cough\*) *really* abused. (Basically steve jobs considered the entire company as his personal bank account and lived on it like a fuckin pharao. Tax free. While stores where serving shitty 10$/h wages). Amazon was recently caught too times and times avoiding paying peanuts on minimal wages when they could.

So sooner or later, we'll have to put limits to what people who really are **trillionaires** can or cannot do with all that money i think while the rest of the system mostly have to live on 1.5K/month (when they are not exploited immigrants that it, because otherwise cut it by 3 again).",0,1374264234,null,0,false,0,cb66fz0,t3_1imvpq,t1_cb66fz0,t1_cb66874,null,1430407090,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

true,gensek,ESTO,Estmark,"&gt;For they have a way of teaching languages in Germany that is not our way, and the consequence is that when the German youth or maiden leaves the gymnasium or high school at fifteen, “it” (as in Germany one conveniently may say) can understand and speak the tongue it has been learning.  In England we have a method that for obtaining the least possible result at the greatest possible expenditure of time and money is perhaps unequalled.  An English boy who has been through a good middle-class school in England can talk to a Frenchman, slowly and with difficulty, about female gardeners and aunts; conversation which, to a man possessed perhaps of neither, is liable to pall.  Possibly, if he be a bright exception, he may be able to tell the time, or make a few guarded observations concerning the weather.  No doubt he could repeat a goodly number of irregular verbs by heart; only, as a matter of fact, few foreigners care to listen to their own irregular verbs, recited by young Englishmen.

[..]

&gt;In the German school the method is somewhat different.  One hour every day is devoted to the same language.  The idea is not to give the lad time between each lesson to forget what he learned at the last; the idea is for him to get on.  There is no comic foreigner provided for his amusement.  The desired language is taught by a German school-master who knows it inside and out as thoroughly as he knows his own.  Maybe this system does not provide the German youth with that perfection of foreign accent for which the British tourist is in every land remarkable, but it has other advantages.  The boy does not call his master “froggy,” or “sausage,” nor prepare for the French or English hour any exhibition of homely wit whatever.  He just sits there, and for his own sake tries to learn that foreign tongue with as little trouble to everybody concerned as possible.  When he has left school he can talk, not about penknives and gardeners and aunts merely, but about European politics, history, Shakespeare, or the musical glasses, according to the turn the conversation may take.

1. No bike lanes on streets and we even had a dispute with our mayor recently about this issue, and he decided we don't need them. Drivers are pretty bad in respecting cyclists, but as our number rises from year to year, it's getting slightly better. 
2. Usually there are no issues about this.
3. Well, I'm trying not to leave my bike for 8 hours unsupervised, especially making a habit out of it.
4. Shops are plenty, not so cheap though. I think the going rate for 1 man hour is about 15-22 Euros. No do it yourself shops that I know of, but for small repairs I could borrow tools from my regular shop and do my work in front of the store.
5. Yes, though lately the parking spaces for bikes have become a bit sparse due to increased number of riders.
6. There are some things similar to Velib, but I have never tried them and I don't know how you can rent one (they most definitely don't have the electronic infrastructure behind Velib).

My other impressions about biking in Bucharest:

One of the biggest problems with drivers' attitude is actually the fact that cyclists don't regularly obey the rules of the road and as such there's a lot of resentment which reflects on all riders, not just the idiots. I think this kind of behaviour is pretty common wherever there's not a good biking infrastructure present, but I would prefer there were less ""salmons"" and ""ninja bikers"" around.  

As I said before, the number of bikers increases every year. In 2009 I barely saw one or two bikes in a week, now, they're practically everywhere, and the number of ONG's and groups dedicated to urban riding is on the rise.

1.) Cars mostly give you the right of way as long as one is an experienced and sufficiently aggressive cyclist. Traffic in general (even for motorists, though they face fewer serious dangers I guess) is not too forgiving towards timid behaviour. There are virtually no exclusive bike lanes that are adhered to and certainly no bike streets.

2.) There's always a suitable lamp post, street sign or similar within a reasonable distance.

3.) Given the locks I have, yes. Anything less and I would not be so sure.

4.) This maybe more down to the cost of my bike, but yes. There's no DIY commune near by, as far as I am aware, but there are certainly options within cyclable distance.

Yeah so basically ""the US first then the rest of the world europe included can die starving before having any tax money; because we're the us"" ? Not going to happen.

&gt; Actually, workers wages and investment are the biggest costs to tech businesses.

You are not gonna make me believe those companies are starving themselves upon wages. Last i read it was about 20% of their revenues top. Most of the benefits are just gonna pile up in tax heavens, under a mattress.

&gt; pay very well for retail positions- over $20 per hour in some cases, plus bonuses (at least in the U.S.). 

20$/h  ; very well ? Is that some kind of joke ? Are we speaking about the same company making abour 100/150 billions a year but paying ""huge wage"" for about 2000/mo ? 

If ""huge wages"" were the same than at the ford era people would be paid 10K/month. For common jobs. Then some more for high level jobs like engineers. Not 20$/hour. The implied condescension is just nauseating.

Next what ? Corps will toss us the same salary when inflation will cross 400% of the current rate in ten years then still call it a ""big wage"" too or continue to hide beneath ""we're jobs creator"" ?

To make myself clear : in scandinavia (northern europe; where life is decent), *welfare* itself is above your ""very good pay"". As in ""our survival minimum number is above your ""high level pay"".

&gt;  like so many wealthy people with Swiss bank accounts- to hide their money

Nah switzerland is fine it's occident. And there is almost nothing here anymore. Because trillionaires don't own anything in their name. They own *the company*, which owns all the money for them and obey their every whims. And they put nothing in swiss or europe or anywhere near occident for that matter.

&gt; when it comes to commerce, we have a broader interest profitability of our tech firms.

Actually it's not even in your interest. Because when the entire US will have seen it's money hidden in bermuda or caiman islands or whatever, nobody else than those companies will have ANY amount of money. 

Then the day those collapse too; think of the car industry collapse. Then detroit. Yeah you know the US town which just filled bankruptcy today. if the judge don't accept to wipe their debts they won't even be able to keep the power company online. It's gonna be fun to watch.

&gt; as a whole to go after taxes they feel they're owed by American tech firms. I think the EU actually has a moral imperative to do that for its citizens, but it's just not in the United States' best interest be a partner in that.

Here's the issue : we think we're actually try to stop ALL the money to just disappear from both your and our countries. You think we just wants all ""your"" dollars from us. When really the tech companies won't leave the US anything either in the end and you'll be just as screwd as us if that agreement ain't signed.

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"&gt; Now you are in an extremely difficult position because you can't get through full federation, or even another substantial step toward it, democratically 

This appears to be the narrative among the eurosceptics of /r/Europe, but in reality further integration faces few real obstacles. The apathy (and in several cases optimism) of the masses cannot be underestimated.  A fiscal union and closer political union are currently on the table, and the longer the crisis drags on the further impetus grows for reform.  Of course though it should be made easy for any nation to opt out of any step towards further integration.

The eurosceptic backlash since 2008 is obviously to blame on the sovereign debt crisis and the management thereof.  Individuals too paranoid to grant the Union further powers are simultaneously lashing out at its inability to perform massive undertakings.  Eventually the crisis will be over, a rainbow will appear and starry eyed children will regain their confidence.

That being said, I just wanted to bring up an older post I made about the democratic legitimacy of a federal Europe:

------------------

[The latest Eurobarometer](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb78/eb78_publ_en.pdf) on the statement ""The EU should develop further into a federation of Nation-States"", **44% said ""Agree""**, **35% ""Disagree""**, **and 21% ""Don't know.""** 

Strongest opposition comes from Scandinavian countries Denmark (76%), Sweden and Finland (71%), then UK (54%).

Strongest support comes from Poland (63%), Czech Republic (55%) and France (55%).

The demographic group with the strongest support for the idea is Male, 25-39, the highest educated (end of education +20y category), white collar, upper class, with a strong political interest.

The countries which currently want it with an absolute majority are Poland, Czech Republic, France, Cyprus, Austria and Slovakia, and countries where a relative majority want it are Luxembourg, Belgium, Spain, Latvia, Germany, Hungary, Portugal, Slovenia, Estonia, Italy, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Malta and Romania (in descending order of approval).

A theoretical federation including only the countries with an absolute majority in favor would [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/z44SouW.jpg).

Such a state would have a GDP of 4.041 trillion USD, larger than the German 3.6 trillion USD (which would make it the 4th largest economy in the world behind USA, China and Japan and the most powerful political bloc of the EU), and a population of approximately 127.9 million, comparable to the Russian 143 million (making it the 10th most populous state on Earth) with a GDP per capita of $31587, similar to that of Israel.

If you were to arbitrarily include the top 5 countries with a relative majority (going from 49-46% approval), you get [this instead.](http://i.imgur.com/YBEhqeQ.jpg)  This ""Europa"" has a gargantuan GDP of 9.7 trillion USD, making it the second largest economy on Earth behind the United States.

High-ranked compared to every other city I've personally seen, but not really *that* good compared to many European cities further south (in e.g Denmark and the Netherlands, from what I've heard).   
Fairly good bike lanes in large parts of the city, but it can certainly improve. I like that we have convenient [pump-stations](http://www.vartgoteborg.se/prod/sk/vargotnu.nsf/1/B883BE459A2DDBA4C125763800342020/fldImage/0.84?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=jpg) here-and-there along the major routes, and also on most of the [ferries](http://www.styrsobolaget.se/CommonResources/Files/www.styrsobolaget.se/%C3%84%204%20L%20B%20Erik%20Ahlquist.jpg)... *Some* roads are either scary or confusing though.

4: Yes, and... well yes, I live in the outskirts, but there are some places more central.

5: Technically, yes... But some people commute 2\*50km or more, so train+walking would be most convenient for them (only *some* regional commuter-trains allow bikes). Still lots of  people who prefer car for convenience, even though they have shorter commuting distance than me (&lt;10km one-way).   
We've recently implemented a [congestion-charge system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothenburg_congestion_tax) for motorised traffic, with control points all around the central city, so we'll see what happens in the near future.

Well we are actually working on it; right now. Then it would be better if we were on the same footing than the US; which is prolly why we are trying so hard to negociate with you.

&gt;  when political coalitions within our countries can't reach agreements

Well i dunno for the US but ours can. France, the UK and Germany are roughly agreeing on the same kind of tax policy, which is about half of europe's economy so not exactly negligible.

&gt;  I mean, there's a good number of people in the U.S. that want to get rid of corporate taxes altogether! 

Let me be blunt : The US megacorps own the media and basically brainwashed most of the population in believing that :

- There was no money in the country due to the economic crisis (while in reality there never was so much money in the collective american hands anywhere in history)
- A 10$/h wage is ""normal""
- Your employer having a life/death right over your lifestyle by firing you anytime he wants to do so is ""normal""
- Companies are poor poor which is why they can't pay bigger wage, which is why we should exempt them from taxes and give them all our money.
- Then suddenly they are the one doing you a *favor* by handing you a few peanuts for your entire lifespan of work

And people are spoonfed it decade after decade so they start believing it. Then the corps fed money in politics (the pacs &amp; co) and basically normalized bribery and country wide apathy to it. 

Then they twisted the republican party into the ""all money to the megacorps"" party and used their media branch to drown any other version (foxnews... i'm watching you :| ) then vote laws suiting them to remove any corps taxes and reinforce corporate welfare (basically state money to the corps). Bailouts , tax breaks, finance normalization, investment funds smoothing. You name it .

Then the people really are believing than no you can't get anything else in life.

Meanwhile a few tech companies are basically giant banks accounts for trillionaire oligarchs hiding everything away.

The biggest corporate victory in the US being make everyone believe their own knee-deep reverse-communism/reverse santa clauss propaganda.

&gt; The arguments used on the other side of the House appear to me to rest in principle and in the main upon one of two suppositions. One of them, which I will not now discuss, is the profound incompetency of the Irish people; but there is another, and it is this. It is, I believe, the conscientious conviction of honourable Gentlemen opposite that when two or more countries, associated but not incorporated together, are in disturbed relations with each other, the remedy is to create an absolute legislative incorporation. On the other hand, they believe that the dissolution of such an incorporation is clearly the mode to bring about the dissolution of the political relations of those countries.

There are obviously cultural differences between now and then of course - loyalty to the King was considered important, there was an empire, etc.

But by and large people arguing against independence use very similar arguments no matter where, or when, the debate is happening.

1. There are bike paths everywhere. A street usually has a bike path on at least one side and if it doesn't, it's usually fine to cycle on the road. The biggest roads don't have bike paths for some reason but the main cycle routes are separated from cars or along roads with very little traffic. 

2. If you are satisfied with leaning it against a wall, no time at all. All big buildings and places where people go have lots of bike stands though. 

3. Depends on where you park it but generally, yes. I always lock the frame of my bike to a secure objects but I know people who never do that and never get their bike stolen. 

4. Yes

5. Yes, it takes maximum of 30 minutes to get into the center if you live inside the other ring road. If you live outside there is a lot of public transport and it's not impossible to cycle. 

6. Don't think so.

7. No, my city is to small for that with only 300k inhabitants and due to the fact that most people own a bike, I don't think it would not be very popular.

sichere 256-Bit-Verschlüsselung ist ein unsinnige Aussage, 256 Bit bezieht sich auf die Schlüssellänge als einziger Faktor. Alleine darauf die Aussage ""ist sicher"" zurückzuführen ist Blödsinn, Algorithmus, Betriebsmodus und Implementierung sind ebenfalls äußerst relevant. 

&gt; Sie werden verschlüsselt und auf andere BitTorrent-Clients verteilt, die Nutzer bilden also selbst die ""Wolke"", wenn man so will.

Wut? Wie soll das $DIENST an Zugriff hindern? Entweder das System nutzt Torrent um Daten auf von mir freigegebenen Systemen zu syncen oder es verteilt die Daten unter allen Bittorrent-Clients. Erstes kann ich einfacher mit Rsync (oder älter noch Rdist) und cfs/encfs haben. Zweites hindert $DIENST nicht daran die Datenpakete ebenfalls mitzuschneiden und zu analysieren. 

&gt; Die Berechtigung besteht in einem Zufalls-generierten Schlüssel, der zwischen den Geräten, die einen bestimmten Ordner teilen, existiert.

Ah ja, Key Infrastructure ist ja auch sooo trivial. Entweder ich kopiere den Schlüssel über einen sicheren Kanal, habe also physikalischen Zugriff, oder ich brauche asymmetrische Schlüssel. Dann kann ich aber auch GnuPG in Dropbox nutzen. 

&gt; Die Handhabung ist denkbar einfach: Man richtet einen oder mehrere Ordner in der App ein, wählt Dateien zum Teilen aus und gibt sie frei - entweder als Read-Only oder zur weiteren Änderung und Nutzung, auch zeitlich limitiert, beispielsweise nur für 24 Stunden und auch hier würde es eine Read-Only-Funktion geben.

Read only auf einem Gerät auf dem ich root bin? Eine äußerst gewagte These. 

Laut Hersteller: 
&gt; BitTorrent Sync was designed with privacy and security in mind. All the traffic between devices is encrypted with AES cypher and a 256-bit key created on the base of the secret—a random string (20 bytes or more) that is unique for every folder.

Viel Spass beim implementieren eines starken PRNG. 

&gt; Local peer discovery. All peers inside local network are discovered by sending broadcast packets. If there are peers with the same secret they respond to the broadcast message and connect.

&gt; Peer exchange (PEX). When two peers are connected, they exchange information about other peers they know.

Das erfordert einen Handshake zur Etablierung eines Secret-Abgleichs mit jedem Knoten im LAN, also n*n-1/2 Verbindungen? 

&gt; BitTorrent tracker. BitTorrent Sync can use a specific tracker server to facilitate peer discovery.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"I was very much joking about how nice it was under the Soviets. I am not sure if my views with Russia is minority/majority. Most people here would have views that range from apathy to suspicion.

On a side note, I have a friend from Latvia. Any time he talks about his country, the Russians come up (either because of the sizeable Russian population in Latvia, or the big bad country of Russia itself). Needless to say, he doesn't have many nice things to about them.

I understand your perspective (or I try to at least). I probably wouldn't like what Russia did to my people if I was you either. And unfortunately, you can't really move your country somewhere else, so I guess it would be doubly upsetting knowing that the Russian problem will never go away.

Those are the same reasons why the view of Russia in America isn't nearly as negative. We fought in WW2 as allies. We never were on the receiving end of their might. No destruction, no occupation. We are also on the other side of the planet, safely protected by vast oceans. So hating the Russians is quite unnatural. We have no reason to dislike them. Being suspicous of their motives? Yes. Hating or disliking them? Probably not. It might annoy you to also know that their is actually a begrudging respect with Russia. We know they can't be bullied. And they have made significant contributions to humanity with their incredible strides in science and engineering. Case in point, we are currently hitch hiking our way to space via the Russians.

And besides... few of the ""rich and perfectly comfortable"" western countries are not doing that well anyway... ahem ahem Spain and Italy.

Also the reason the West NEEDS Eastern Europe is because without them they will never reach the size and power it needs to become a world power. Germany France or UK cannot do it by themselves.

true,[deleted],null,null,"1) I've had some close calls. I started commuting about five years ago when I moved to a neighbouring town (Leeds, and I work in Bradford). I used to live within walking distance of where I work, but now I commute about ten miles each way. Some of this is on six-lane roads with big roundabouts where I have to cross several lanes to be in the right position to turn where I want to go. It used to be that I got off and pushed the bike across pedestrian crossings but my confidence is better and I've learnt to be aggressive. I don't shake my fist or anything but I signal what I am going to do and if I have time to do a bit of it before the next car gets there, and I know the driver can see me, then I do it. It's what car drivers would do, and I am a vehicle on the road just like them. I wave my thanks and get on with it. I think it helps that I am pretty quick now too, especially coming home down the six lane road when I am as fast as the cars and often faster.

There are plans for a Leeds - Bradford cycle ""superhighway"" which will go past my house and almost all the way to work. This will be separated lanes for most of the way, although some of the designs for bus stops and roundabouts look a bit scary. I think in parts of Bradford I will still be using the road when it is built. 

2) When I got to work, which is at a university, there are cages that have electronic card access. Bikes are locked up individually in there. I rarely have a problem in other places. At the worst there is a lamppost nearby that I can use. When I started I used to worry about this a lot but I rarely give it a thought now. 

3) Usually. The place where I commute to (Bradford) has some of the highest car insurance in the country because of crime and accidents, but it's very rare that I feel like I can't lock my bike up and leave it for a few hours. I wouldn't leave it for a full day though. If I didn't have the cages at work I'd bring it into the office with me.

4) There is one at the university. Surprising how many local bike shops there are where I live too, some of which are quite famous. Bob Jackson's is just down the road from me, and whilst they're a frame manufacturer who won't fix your bike they will sell me the parts I need. Mostly if I can't do it I use a guy calling himself The Bike Doctor. He'll come and collect it, fix it up and then drop it off a day or two later. 

5) I'm not sure. I work at a university and there are nearly 2,000 employees, and when the students are here there are another 17,000 people on campus. There isn't the space for everyone to tie up a bike. Also, every direction you can go in from Bradford city centre is uphill. They are not serious hills but for people who aren't already fit or regular cyclists they are quite intimidating. When you add the traffic on the main roads people are easily put off. Plenty do though, and sometimes the university gives a free breakfast to people who cycle in to encourage people to do it. One of my jobs is looking after email mailing lists. The Bicycle Use Group mailing list has 600 members of staff. 

6) I don't know of a government scheme in Bradford or Leeds or anyone who does it on a private basis but the university does this. They have around twenty bikes for social rides and for hiring out to students and visitors. It seems to be quite popular. I had a cigarette next to the cage where they are kept today and there were only four or five in there.

La presse à billet, c'est la clef la plus intéressante de l'histoire depuis son inventeur Machiavelli (avant c'est la religion), celui qui la possède tient de facto la politique du pays qu'il suffit de droguer aux déficits pour en prendre le contrôle.

Et oui, notre révolution est potentiellement aussi bidon que celle de Libye y a deux ans, enfin bon je dis ça je dis rien, j'ai pas particulièrement étudié la question, mais c'est le genre de question que pose le prisme: avant le téléphone, la télé, et tout ça, quelques antifa de l’époque (déjà des bourgeois lol), quelques mercenaires étrangers, une mise en scène dramatique avec des têtes qui tombent et hop, une petite révolution pas cher, pas besoin de guerre... moi je dis ça se peut, surtout quand tu lis les lumières.

Not necessarily. The Russian Federation inherited the USSR's role in the security council and that was a much more dramatic changed than Scotland seceding would be. In terms of military assets; while Scots are generally over represented in HM Armed Forces there is a substantial under-spend by the MoD in Scotland. Roughly £3.5 billion of Scottish taxes goes to the military compared to £2 billion worth of Defense spending in Scotland. 

The question of Trident is a bit trickier but the UK would unquestionably keep it's nukes. It would be more of a question of where they would be re-based (Wales probably, IMO) and who would pay for it.

He said that he had wandered from Smygehuk, and that he had come to fart in my face. I flinched, but within a fraction of one ten thousandth of a second, I found myself lying on the ground with his snow-white buttocks painfully close to my face. Slowly, slowly, he brought them closer and closer to me, just as close so that his sphincter almost touched my vibrating nose tip. Then we lay there for several minutes and just breathed. And then he farted. It was like I disappeared for a moment and when I woke again, he was gone. Sometimes I believe I see him come walking along the road, sometimes I believe I hear the sound of his warm air against my cheek. But he's gone, gone like a wind.

&gt;The Albanian mafia in France is described as having a monopoly over many criminal transactions including arms and drug trafficking.

&gt;In 1989, Belgian Prime Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants was kidnapped in a plot organized by Basri Bajrami. Bajrami was acknowledged by authorities as a member of the Albanian Mafia at that time.

Chissà, probabilmente i pecoroni c'erano anche ai tempi di Superquark, ma adesso li sentiamo più spesso perché ci sono Twitter e Facebook e quant'altro a fare da cassa di risonanza. E, purtroppo, c'è Giacobbo a dar corda a questa gente.

Giacobbo, in sostanza, ha trovato il modo di raccogliere più telespettatori possibile con la sottile arte della lusinga. Superquark ti informerà, pacatamente, delle ultime notizie sulla lotta al tumore al pancreas; ma Voyager ti rivelerà il segreto, chessò, della morte di Michael Jackson, e tu, caro telespettatore, sarai uno dei privilegiati che scopriranno la verità nascosta.

Ma Giacobbo non si fa puro complottista. Alle teorie del complotto strizza l'occhio, anzi ne strizza mille, lasciando aperta una domanda che in realtà è ben chiusa, rimanendo possibilista per insinuare il dubbio nel telespettatore e lasciargli il retrogusto della conoscenza privilegiata, del segreto sussurrato in un orecchio, dello spiraglio di luce invisibile agli altri.

Il punto è che se la gggente preferisce Giacobbo a Piero Angela è perché il primo è un maestro adulatore. Ha capito che i complottisti esistono perché piace credersi i depositari di una conoscenza proibita ai più, e, approdando in Rai, ha dato legittimità alle teorie del complotto, facendole diventare mainstream.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Those German states are definitely told that they need to step up their game. Furthermore, what gets subsidized in Germany are regional state budgets, which make up much less of the relative GDP than the federal budget of European nations that currently need financial assistance. Also, Germany is in a very peculiar situation, since the economy of a great portion of the country was wrecked by 40 years of Real Socialism, while the rest developed independently into a more advanced economy.

Being competitive in no way precludes cooperation. The options aren't some Darwinistic existential battle vs a compassionate symbiotic utopia. Wherever cooperation yields positive results we should obviously strive for it.

Production comes before demand, thus raising demand must not be the primary objective of economic policy. An economy is built on that which creates value. You cannot, for an extended period, have aggregate demand above the sum of what gets produced by those who demand, and not experience some form of crash later on. The subsequent fall in prices and wages is not a race to the bottom but a logical readjustment. To avoid it, one can 1) produce more 2) produce more efficiently and that which is more sought after 3) live more modestly.

I don't understand the reasoning according to which richer countries should subsidize poorer ones. It goes against national sovereignty and self-determination, against the purpose of the EU, it hurts the economies of both the givers and the recipients, and it is unfair. It also has nothing to do with cooperation. Why should some countries and their economies be held to a different standard than others? I hope the reasoning isn't that because e.g. Germany is a net exporting nation, it should subsidize the importing nation to keep up demand for its own exports. Why would it produce at all, then? In such a scenario, a rational agent would just stop exporting and stop subsidizing and have the same net effect (plus more free time).

An arrangement in which some countries (unjustly) have to subsidize others would also mean a severe loss of sovereignty for the recipients. The current measures of austerity may be externally imposed, but their goal is actually to get struggling economies back on their feet again (obviously combined with other temporary or one-time macroeconomic measures like QE and hair cuts). Because the EU aims to be prosperous, it wishes, and has some tools to force, its member nations to be on a sustainable prosperous path. This helps to enact measures deemed necessary for a nation to get on that path, as opposed to the previously mentioned third option of living more modestly (which would simply entail poverty until the country adjusts to a low demand, largely self-substinent society) – which might be a lot harder if the measures had to be put through by those who answer directly to the people because there is a good chance that they would not be in office for long and that opportunistic demagogues would take their place to throw the country into upheaval. It's an ugly thought that a certain temporary infringement on self-determination is necessary (at least if the affected populace still agrees that it wishes to be on a sustainably prosperous path) and I'm uncomfortable with it – this was, however, preceded by agreements of all involved that stipulated that just that would be the consequence of continuously deviating from what has collectively been determined to be a desirable and sustainable economic trajectory. (And yes, other countries have deviated also, but they have managed to avoid needing emergency loans and gifts.)",0,1374310487,null,0,1374310829,0,cb6jso4,t3_1imcau,t1_cb6jso4,t1_cb6aobt,null,1430400656,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I honestly believe that the EU nations could effectively operate and control their militaries outside of their borders if they took the initiative to actually try. Attempts so far have been half-hearted at best because a good number of nations don't want to (due to NATO), many don't see the point, and yet other's don't know how to. A gradual disinvolvement with NATO and the US bases in the EU would frame the first real opportunity to wake up and get their shit sorted.

The reason I believe that it can work without necessitating more spending in the EU is due to the nature of desired EU power projection (if desired a all), military would be a last resort and can work when needed (Mali).

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  Except for the Czechs those countries have enough money to subsidize their nuclear energy lobby.

They already do, [£2.3bn in the UK alone](https://www.google.de/search?q=inurl%3Afda9ea9a-ac29-11e2-a063-00144feabdc0). This is mostly for dealing with waste, so it will go on for long after the plants will have closed and have been decommissioned, which will be rather expensive by itself. Indirectly, the state also serves as a free insurance for the risk, if the operators would have to pay for insurance themselves cost would be much higher.

Nuclear energy has also received quite a lot of R&amp;D subsidies in the past, if ""leveling the playing field"" is what they're after, then renewables still have a lot they could draw from until they have caught up with accumulated subsidies.

Edit: [US figures](http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2012/08/has-there-ever-been-a-level-energy-playing-field-putting-renewables-subsidies-in-context), but that's all I could find for now:

*Taking a longer-term view and again adjusting for inflation, the authors find that between 1918 and 2009, the oil and gas industry received a cumulative $446.96 billion in subsidies compared to just $5.93 billion given to renewables in the years between 1994 and 2009. Meanwhile, the nuclear industry benefitted from a cumulative $185.38 billion in federal subsidies between 1947 and 1999.*

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; Unfree? What is your definition of free? Free to follow own whims and desires ? That is a freedom that sucks, not only for women but for all.

What? Yes, freedom is the freedom to do what you want. Freedom is not slavery.

&gt; You see this is my No. 1 problem with liberal thinking. The cult of autonomy. Meaningful freedom is not the freedom to do what you want to, but to do what is actually good for you. Of course questions like who and who gets to tell that are very good questions, but ""nobody no way "" is just not a constructive answer to that. Freedom to do what you want does nothing but enslave you to your own ego, vanity an desires. Every premodern thinker understood that.

This is downright bizarre. Let me guess, you decide what's good for women?

&gt; The cult of autonomy also means that because everybody lives for their own pitiful little desires and goals, each is as good as the other, there is no ranking, and no hierarchy, because there is no shared goal, and every ranking, if rational, derives from being fit of a certain purpose. Hence this whole absurdity of egalitarianism.

Or, you know, you could base hierarchies on voluntary participation. Or at least give it a modicum of credibility by shaping it through democracy. ""Absurdity of egalitarianism"", nice troll.

Yes, that's how ~~abducting~~ abdicating works, in the case of a referendum the Queen would have to sign it. Otherwise the parliament could and should overthrow her and claim the republic without the signature. So that's really not an argument for the impossibility of ending the monarchy

If staying in a hotel is still too expensive, or all the places are already filled to the brim, try couchsurfing. Crouchsurfing.org has a lot of offers, the convention center is in Deutz, on the border of Mülheim (not Mülheim an der Ruhr!), so I would look for places there.

Yeah, they can play monarchy as much as they want with their meaningless titles, they just won't receive public money anymore (that the Windsors won't go broke goes without saying).

The benefit of a monarchy is simple: they represent the country's ideals when the politics go sour. In Spain right now everything is a mess. Mr. Rajoy and his party have their plates full handling an economic crisis as best they can, which is not good enough, while being embroiled in a kickback-filled, party-financing slush fund scandal. If it was a republic the country's ideals would be represented by Mr. Rajoy's horrible situation, and yet you'd still have people who would defend his position in the name and for the benefit of the country as a whole.

Instead in these tough times we can direct our ideals towards the monarchy. They should carry an image like Pope Francis has right now: they should be raising money for schools and hospitals, and other charity; little things that might not fix the grand problems but certainly help locally and help the morale of the country. That should be what you think when you think Spain and the monarch.

Ah, but here lies the real trouble with a monarchy. The Spanish monarchy is deep in its own scandal about favors and kickbacks and they're even more untouchable than the politicians. This brings us back to the core of what a monarchy is and why it's incompatible with a free society: it's essentially just an unelected head of state and their family with access to public money who are above much of the law.

* combined cycle: some special plants receive subsidies, other retrieve a payment if they aren't used(the energy demand is low due to the depresion), because they are needed to regulate the system
* Hydroelectricity: are regulators of the system, they retrieve some support due to that. And some plants are in the special regimen.

The only type of plants that aren't supposed to retrieve public money are the nuclear plants, However, the government paid part of the construction cost and it's going to pay part of the cost of the long term storage of residues.

* You want to only do 2 years in your current program then you have to pass the exam. I'm almost positive you will not achieve this. Your French is probably lacking, so are you mathematics skills.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; Those German states are definitely told that they need to step up their game.

Well, you can also tell Greece et al. they need to step up their game but at the same time not let the people there suffer? I'm obviously not opposed to the concept of development and increasing production in general. 

&gt; Furthermore, what gets subsidized in Germany are regional state budgets, which make up much less of the relative GDP than the federal budget of European nations that currently need financial assistance. 

This requires some further elaboration. Relative to what? Also, the current financial assistance is loans, are you subtracting the expected return or not? There is a number of issues here and I'm not even sure what values you're comparing. 

&gt; Also, Germany is in a very peculiar situation, since the economy of a great portion of the country was wrecked by 40 years of Real Socialism, while the rest developed independently into a more advanced economy.

I don't see how this is relevant. Aren't there any states in Western Germany that are in deficit wrt other states of Western Germany? And I don't think the situation is really peculiar. Southern Italy is subsidised by Northern Italy. The Greek metropolitan areas subsidise all those little islands. The urban Finnish service industry subsidises the frozen all-year-round Northern provinces. The exact circumstances may be different, but I don't see the uniqueness in the situation. 

&gt; Production comes before demand, thus raising demand must not be the primary objective of economic policy. An economy is built on that which creates value. You cannot, for an extended period, have aggregate demand above the sum of what gets produced by those who demand, and not experience some form of crash later on.

Demand in monetary terms is different than demand in practical terms (the needs). I don't necessarily disagree that current production exceeds the needs of the population but then you have to ask yourself why there is so much poverty. It's a distribution problem. The total production exceeds the needs of the total population but the poor regions do not produce anything of value to exchange for the goods they need. So, the surplus regions either have decrease production (since no one can buy their stuff) or in some form give it away. 

&gt; The subsequent fall in prices and wages is not a race to the bottom but a logical readjustment. To avoid it, one can 1) produce more 2) produce more efficiently and that which is more sought after 3) live more modestly.

This is the problem you don't see though. There always are going to be regions that lag behind others in terms of capital development (and therefore production capacity). I don't want to live in a world where these regions are told to ""live more modestly"" all the time. It's cruel because, despite the nice word you use, it means people suffering even though there is enough stuff produced to cover everyone's needs. 

&gt; I don't understand the reasoning according to which richer countries should subsidize poorer ones. It goes against national sovereignty and self-determination, against the purpose of the EU, it hurts the economies of both the givers and the recipients, and it is unfair. It also has nothing to do with cooperation. Why should some countries and their economies be held to a different standard than others?

It goes against the national sovereignty and self-determination of the recipient or the givers? Or both? It's supposed to be an act of solidarity, the same way that the taxes inside a country subsidise the poor or the richer regions inside a country subsidise the least productive ones. It does not really hurt the economy of the givers and it only marginally hurts the economy of the recipients (which may well be ameliorated if you use the right incentives and cooperation scheme). 

&gt; I hope the reasoning isn't that because e.g. Germany is a net exporting nation, it should subsidize the importing nation to keep up demand for its own exports. Why would it produce at all, then? In such a scenario, a rational agent would just stop exporting and stop subsidizing and have the same net effect (plus more free time).

Actually, it's not that bad of an argument because it demonstrates the irrationality of the current system. We can see it happening right now. The periphery countries are saving and are trying not to spend above their means which decreases overall demand. Do you think that Germans will get more free time as a result? Due to the decrease in demand, employers will just lay off people. No one is going to step in and say ""since we're self-sustainable we will all work fewer hours and not care about producing extra for the foreigners"". The system is not rational. 

&gt; An arrangement in which some countries (unjustly) have to subsidize others would also mean a severe loss of sovereignty for the recipients.

Well, it's an option but definitely not the only one and I'm pretty sure not the most sustainable one. The states of Germany for instance are pooling decision-making power together in the institutions of the federal level. I don't see this as a loss of sovereignty. It's just having a common institution for making joint decisions in matters that concern all Germans. There's a balance to be struck between social responsibility and individual freedom and it exists in all levels of governance: The individual vs his social circle, a neighbourhood vs the municipality, a municipality vs the state and so on. This trade off of freedom vs responsibility between the smaller and the bigger organisational structures is unavoidable. You seem to be making an arbitrary decision that in some levels this trade-off is real while at some other levels it implies a so-called loss of sovereignty and is anathema. 

&gt; The current measures of austerity may be externally imposed, but their goal is actually to get struggling economies back on their feet again (obviously combined with other temporary or one-time macroeconomic measures like QE and hair cuts).

I don't really see it that way. Forcing a country to sell off its properties and starve its own people will not make them more competitive and independent, it will make them more dependent if anything. It's like saying ""a lack of a social safety net will make you more independent"". I doesn't because it restricts your choices to decide what to do with your life. 

&gt; Because the EU aims to be prosperous, it wishes, and has some tools to force, its member nations to be on a sustainable prosperous path. This helps to enact measures deemed necessary for a nation to get on that path, as opposed to the previously mentioned third option of living more modestly (which would simply entail poverty until the country adjusts to a low demand, largely self-substinent society)

You're making my argument for me though. The imposed measures are doing not the former but the latter thing you mention. Not out of malice, but because they're designed to cost the least for the creditor countries. 

&gt; It's an ugly thought that a certain temporary infringement on self-determination is necessary (at least if the affected populace still agrees that it wishes to be on a sustainably prosperous path) and I'm uncomfortable with it – this was, however, preceded by agreements of all involved that stipulated that just that would be the consequence of continuously deviating from what has collectively been determined to be a desirable and sustainable economic trajectory. (And yes, other countries have deviated also, but they have managed to avoid needing emergency loans and gifts.)

So you're fine when it comes to ""temporarily"" suspending self-determination on the debtor countries because you believe that the imposed measures will help them have more self-determination in the future? Do you actually believe that this is what has been happening? ",0,1374330964,null,0,false,0,cb6mos2,t3_1imcau,t1_cb6mos2,t1_cb6jso4,null,1430399357,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

decommissioning cost.


Decom cost is rapidly coming down as old plants are phased away. Subsidies would definitely help research even better decom technologies and building techniques in the same way subs for renewables are being used to try and find new technologies. Right now due to decom costs, the price per unit is slightly higher than coal. Soon it will be under.

Waste is something that is crying out to be properly tackled by the EU, the sites are there, is just management that is the issue since everyone is reluctant to say yes in fear of having the whole supply left to them. Subs and ultimately **more discussion** would solve this.



This would mean there would practically be no problems with nuclear and we can use this instead of renewable which fluctuates, turning off vital systems temporary, freezes up engineering industries, loss of power even for a few seconds causes **huge** damage costs and even leads to death and injuries.



Renewables are just able to cover current electricitys usages, our reliance on fossil fuels is not just for electricity but also petroleum in cars, lorrys, planes, cargo ships etc. We need the **huge** supplys of electricity to create hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cells, electrical batteries, and artificial diesels for when the time comes and oil runs out.



Energy demand is ever growing, it will not shrink. These subsidies will rapidly increase the rate at which nuclear research in completed. Interesting videos are [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HxI3-DzPWU) and even better [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JijgbC8uNRo).

true,Delheru,FINL,Finland,"&gt; You lost me. Are you saying that people who buy UK tabloids abroad are more likely to visit the UK?

I'm saying that they are already sending money to the UK the instant they buy those tabloids. I have no data to back this one up, but intuitively if we take two groups of, say, Chinese or Americans. One group has never touched a UK tabloid, the other group is defined by the fact that they have. Do you think these two groups have similar France/UK visit ratios when going to Europe? *Surely* the tabloid group is more interested in the UK than the group that never touched the tabloids.

&gt; And that they are enough to be significant for the economy?

The tabloids themselves are already quite significant if we're talking on the scale of the royal spending (so tens to hundreds of millions, not billions to tens of billions). Every traveller to the UK brings about 600 GBP ( http://www.visitbritain.org/insightsandstatistics/inboundtourismfacts/ ), so it doesn't take too many to start making an impact. If even one in 50 visitors to the UK has been influenced by the tabloids (say, 10% of that one-in-50 group would have gone to France or Italy were it not for the tabloids) we're looking at 0.2% of the total tourism of the UK. That - according to the link I just had there - amounts to slightly shy of 40 million GBP. Nothing to sneeze at.

&gt;  Do tabloids promote British culture, which is fundamentally different than US culture?

The royal family does. It gets broadcast through tabloids, BBC, books and lord knows what.

I wouldn't say it is *fundamentally* different, but it IS different, and that is important. It helps balance the US influence from being quite overwhelming.",0,1374338909,null,0,false,0,cb6ouam,t3_1iovr1,t1_cb6ouam,t1_cb6omie,null,1430398279,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

No doubt I will receive a lot of hate, so a disclaimer: I am a strong secularist (and an atheist, but that's only marginally relevant). I know how it feels like to have religious morals codified into law (even if they are not as extreme as some interpretations of the Sharia) and I do not support it. But I also don't think that a ban on a certain clothing item will empower those who are oppressed by a certain religion.  And of course, if there's a legitimate reason to verify someone's identity by a competent authority, yeah, that's okay. But similarly to banning hoodies in many countries, assuming that everyone is a criminal, it's no way to go.

Il problema di fondo quando si dibatte di certi argomenti è che spesso si confonde il ""creazionismo"" con una qualsiasi teoria dell'evoluzione diversa da quella darwiniana. Ma non è il tuo caso. Mi preme però ribadire che mentre l'evoluzione (comparsa di nuove specie viventi) è un fatto che si osserva (seppur non direttamente, ma attraverso lo studio e la datazione dei fossili) il darwinismo (credo che si sottindendesse questo) è una teoria che cerca di spiegare il fatto.

Western media has been slandering Romania and Bulgaria ever since they joined the EU. Just look at the title of the news story you linked to: ""London's Romanian 'shanty town'"". But wait, those squatters aren't actually Romanian, they're Roma. Don't expect the BBC to point that out though. Nevermind the fact that they're illegal immigrants and that it would be next to impossible for them to enter the Schengen Area through Hungary or that Hungary, a country that is actually in the Schengen Area, has exactly the same amount of Roma by percentage of its population as Romania. Hell, I'd be surprised if the average westerner knew that Roma's are not the majority in Romania. 

And what can Romanians expect after six years of constant slander when exerciting their right to freedom of movement within the EU? Take a guess. What's funny about this whole ordeal is that it's not being Romanian that gets you on the receiving end of insults and such, it's how you look. The last time I traveled to Germany people treated me like a local. My friend on the other hand? He went to a supermarket to buy food and ended up being followed around by one of the staff. The twist? He looks like your average slav, I look like your average german. 

And as for the numerous misconceptions regarding Romania as a nation, I'm not even going to bother. Suffice to say, I remember a person on this very site admitting that he thought we couldn't even afford cars and got around using carts.

I've enjoyed Borchert, get his complete work, it's mostly short stories. Goethe (Faust is a must, don't even start reading anything else before that), Patrick Suesskind, specifically Die Taube und Das Parfuem. The complete works of Kafka need no further recommendation. Berlin Alexanderplatz by Doeblin is interesting, if you want to train Stilmittel (quite enjoyed reading it during Abitur, writing about it... not so much). Thomas Mann is great if you can make it through, e.g. Budenbrooks is hard to digest. Many plays are worth reading, for example Die Raeuber by Schiller is a classic. In general, pick up those yellow Reclam booklets. They don't take a lot of space and should be very inexpensive.

Edit: I don't feel good without mentioning Herman Hesse. If you feel like piercing through the communism bullshit (I figure you are from the US), try Das Kapital by Karl Marx.

In any event, if you look for a job at the end, go home and then come back 2 months later, I guess you won't be breaking the rules.

If you have a college degree in engineering or science, it's much easier to get a job in a technical field and if you get an offer you will get a work visa. 

Outside of the two cases above, it will be very difficult to find a non-professional job and the law says not only must you be the only person who qualifies for a job, you must be paid at a salary level of a middle-manager. So really you need to have some work experience before you try to get a job in France. Many people try to move to France and change careers at the same time. This is making things doubly hard. Get some experience in the field you are interested in.

Unless you are in a technical field you'll need to be fluent in France. That means two years of college level French.

No, because the phenomenon in Germany can be interpreted as a relapse into a previous stage (3rd Reich, GDR), while in the US and the UK such massive surveillance is something new.  One might even argue that the 3rd Reich never really went away, but merely received a paint job.

Something to consider is what happens when there are delays.  Travelling by train is great in France thanks to the TGV, but it can be very expensive and problematic due to snow.  Equally, driving can become an issue as a result of snow.  

I guess what I'm saying is that you need a ""buffer time"" for when you encounter delays, which is very possible in winter.  Delays can cause endless frustration and you could lose valuable time, putting more pressure to fulfil your itinerary.   

Have you chosen Bern for a specific reason?  Why Bern and not elsewhere in Switzerland?

When you say Avignon area, are you thinking Avignon / Nimes / Arles / the Luberon Valley (e.g. Gordes)? 

I would double check what Alsace is like in winter, especially the smaller villages.  Strasbourg will have a great Christmas market.  That part of France is particularly cold in winter.  

Avignon is great to visit, but you don't need a long time there, depending on your interests.

It had it's moments but I wasn't that impressed.

When I went back I spent a whole weekend, and went away with a completely different impression. We had some AMAZING pizza (Naples is known as the birthplace of pizza) and it's dirt cheap. Something like a 14"" pizza and a beer was only like 7€, they also have amazing coffee, and sfogliatelle and baba are local specialties that are really good and really cheap. On my first trip I saw narrow, crowded and dirty streets but the second time those same streets were rustic and charming. Now I'll go back any chance I get.

Also in the area outside of Naples has breathtaking scenery, Capri is a destination for the rich and famous and the Sorrentine Peninsula is the most beautiful place I've ever been. I'd also recommend looking up an Italian school for stranieri. They usually aren't too expensive, it'll make learning the language immensely easier, and you'll meet a lot if interesting people.

If anything, we should be working on making our second house democratic (or at least more democratic than it is). 

Republicanism for Britain seems just too unlikely, or at least very far off - for England, at least. We all know there's a very real possibility of a Scottish republic becoming reality in the next year or so, and since the late 20th century, there's been arguably more support for an independent Welsh republic. Northern Ireland is... well, complicated, as we know. As long as the United Kingdom is still a united kingdom, I think us British should be working towards (1) more democracy in both houses and (2) further devolution of Scotland (if it doesn't become independent next year), Wales and Northern Ireland. And who knows, after all this is done, we may have an independent Scotland, Wales and maybe I'm being far too optimistic, but an independent Northern Ireland or... I can't believe I'm even thinking of this... but a unified Ireland? England then will be a lone little kingdom, and support for a republic would probably be *far* more than it is now, since English people will see that England is not the imperial power it was over 100 years ago.

The British tourism industry is successful without figureheads, castles and palaces would remain part of Britain anyway, as in France. Attractions such as the London Eye, Trafalgar Square, Stonehenge, the beautiful countryside and Lake District, will still be there in  a Republic. Ceremonies such as the changing of the guard don't need to change either, and also people don't visit Saudi Arabia because their head of state isn't elected.

If you're talking about the Crown Estate, [you could've done better to have a look at the 'about us' section on their website](www.thecrownestate.co.uk/about-us/) which states that it is ""not the private property of HM the Queen"" - I get that 'Crown' is similar to 'monarch' and 'royal' but it doesn't legally have the same context. 

The way to have politicians you can trust, who aren't 'shitty', is to have accountability and limits on their power. This is something that the monarchy gets in the way of.

Also, it does add rights to people, as it gives them the right to be represented by the head of their country, and even the right to be the head of their country.

* A 28 year old woman with down syndrome was killed by her mother.  

* Cycling, as Belgians still haven't lost their appetite for ""Le Tour de France"" and that is getting quite a lot of media attention, we suddenly aren't that fond of cyclists anymore.

* A citizen can now directly request things to be changed in police databases if they aren't correct, and we are starting an DNA database.

* ""De Gentsefeesten"" are starting this weekend, a 10 day festival in the city of Ghent, visitors are advised to drink enough water because it is hot. 

* Since I have been mentioning it a couple of weeks now, ""De blokkendoos"" and antwerp located kindergarden that has a bit of a pedophilia scare a couple of weeks ago is seeing personnel being threatened by sharia4belgium ( a muslim fringe group ) and the mother who started it all is suing the mayor of antwerp.
