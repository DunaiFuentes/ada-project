in the north try [hamburg](http://www.luminapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/hamburg.jpg), [kiel](http://img.dooyoo.de/DE_DE/orig/0/3/8/8/6/388632.jpg) or [flensburg](http://www.folkbaltica.de/uploads/pics/flensburg.jpg). just take a trip to the ostsee. their harbors are pretty awesome if you are into that. you can even visit berlin from there.

If feasible you could try to start your trip in Zürich, Swiss (i believe that's the biggest international in the overal area), then make your way by the lake of constance towards Munich and then proceed north from there and end your trip in Hamburg or Berlin. 

If you decide to stop by the Lake of constance, Friedrichshafen is not the place you wanna be, mostly industry and boring architecture due to devastating destruction in ww2.

 In my experience with other european clubs (i follow a few because i love the game and want as much as possible), the ""home-grown"" fans tend to appreciate any interest people have in their club and welcome new fans gladly, especially in cases where the team's not a ""big"" club.

If I don't have a contract with him.... it's still hard as fuck and just takes a legal step less or two to have the police drag me out of here.

Weil wir den 'Luxus' haben, auf tierische Nahrung verzichten zu können (deine Worte), haben wir auch die moralische Pflicht, darüber nachzudenken, ob wir das nicht tun sollten. Wer Fleisch isst, tut es nicht aus Notwendigkeit, sondern entweder aus Gewohnheit und selbstgewählter Unwissenheit oder aber aus der persönlichen Überzeugung, dass der kulinarische Genuss, die Wahrung der Tradition, etc. die Tierhaltung und -schlachtung rechtfertigen.

In a modern British university setting, I understand that these are somewhat common ways of analysing and/or breaking down literature. So, you might take a Jane Austen novel, and analyze it from: 

* A feminist point of view - are here heroines strong characters, or are they merely strong masks put on weak characters, to strengthen patriarchal society? You might argue that Austen books have seeded a new sort of culture of women being 'swept off their feet', like in Bridget Jones, or a hundred other such films and books, where a feisty but basically meek woman waits for her prince charming.

* A marxist point of view - what do her books say about 'old money' and 'new money'? Again, along the same lines, you might say that, for instance, Mr Darcy (an arrogant aristocrat who bumbles along, causing offense, before sweeping our heroine off her feet) is a way of rehabilitating the aristocracy. And indeed you might find in China that this idea of 'Mr Darcy who will sweep me off my feet to live in a castle' is a major way in which Chinese women view all Westerners.

This often has the effect of being a sort of reductionist kill-joy. I'll take this thing you naively enjoyed and stamp all over it. But it can nevertheless reveal some interesting preconceptions and foundations, and certainly much opportunity for academic chatter.

Thanks so much for helping me catch up, and please have a great day. Also, it wasn't until I moved here that I took the charge of Americans being Imperialists seriously. Before this I always thought it was an outdated term. So reading about Deobandi would be good for me, too.

We actually had a sort of left-wing tea-party like insurgency within our left-wing Labour party, which was called the Marxist Tendency, which discredited the party, and is widely regarded as one of the reasons Maggie Thatcher was able to push through quite right wing policies. On the continent they do actually tend to have communists in parliament.

But although the economic theory is discredited, what people call a cultural Marxism does tend to live on in the universities. I'm a bit ambivalent about it, it can be interesting, I suppose because it is about the morality of economics, but it seems dubious to have something like that which is specifically from a particular ideological perspective.

Also, on imperialism, you will certainly find a lot, and in my opinion you will often find that element overplayed in respect of America. Again, it's interesting to consider (you might like this mini-doc about the global trade aspect: http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2012/12/2012124114036244389.html), but a lot of the perspectives are heavily biased.

Je suis l'auteure de ce texte, d'où les -e- qui permettent de ne pas présumer que je suis un homme. Mon post suivant porte d'ailleurs sur cette question des féminisations un peu lourdes mais que je trouve nécessaires &lt;http://blog.ecologie-politique.eu/post/Citoyen-ne-s-a-vos-tirets&gt;...

Pour répondre à vos questions :

-je cuisine (j'ai même monté un réseau informel écolo, aujourd'hui disparu, d'échanges de savoirs modestes et de recettes de cuisine en live) mais j'aime aussi et autant goûter la cuisine des autres ;

-je suis secrétaire de rédaction bénévole depuis 2007, c'est un métier que j'ai appris sur le tas, dans un cadre militant, pour lequel je ne suis ni diplômée ni reconnue ni rémunérée ;

-si j'ai eu le temps de monter des réseaux et d'apprendre tout ça, c'est que je suis au chômage, depuis 2004, alors la différence entre moi et la classe moyenne, elle existe, j'en fais l'expérience tous les jours ;

-et ce qui m'a motivée pour écrire ce texte, c'est de demander conseil à une amie sur un texte littéraire et de voir l'acuité de son regard et la précision de ses remarques... elle n'est pas littéraire de formation (c'est moi qui ai fait lettres, pas elle) mais elle a développé son sens critique, notamment en exerçant une activité bénévole, et tout le monde a certes une sensibilité pour apprécier ou pas un texte, mais quand on n'a (comme moi, hélas) à dire que ""j'aime/j'aime pas"" et qu'on a droit de vie et de mort sur les textes parce qu'on est éditeur-e-s, je trouve ça respectueux (et tellement plus riche !) de chercher autour de soi des personnes avec ce vrai regard pour leur demander conseil de temps en temps.

Dans mon texte il ne faut pas prendre ""métier"" dans le sens de ""corporation à laquelle on appartient grâce à un passe-droit"", ou de gagne-pain, mais dans celui de compétences acquises, à force de temps passé, de passion, de qualités très personnelles aussi.

Et cet Internet qui fait surgir des compétences de l'ensemble du public, certes ont y publie les ""j'aime/j'aime pas"", mais on s'extasie plutôt sur le fait que surgissent de la multitude des contributions de qualité, qui suivent un parcours de reconnaissance sociale différent de ce qui existait avant le net (qui a ses qualités et ses défauts).

Russia, which publicly supported the French intervention says it will send an Antonov 124 plane and ground troops of the 224th Air Detachment to Mali. This comes as a surprise considering its stance of non-intervention in Syria. In response, the Russian government says it's acting under UN and African Union decisions. Trainers could be sent to Mali, but not to aid France, but the Malian government itself, a semantic detail which is ""very important for Moscow"" and may hide strategic interests.

Russian corporations fear a destabilization of the region. During Soviet times, Mali is the Francophone African country which had the closest ties with the USSR. The USSR had exploited a gold mine there, today closed. Other Russian corporations have important economic interests in the neighboring countries of Mali.

""Love or devotion to one's country.""

It is not love of community, but country. I both admire and detest a lot of things my country and most every country do. I don't side like to consider myself a patriot because I find it counterproductive to human advancement. Devotion to one's country is not contrary to, but often an obstacle to devotion to one's fellow man. My mild distaste for patriotism does not blind me the the fact that the average man in every country feels patriotic to a degree. A sense of community and striving to better your country are not qualities I reject, but rather would see put toward cooperative efforts, which is often not the case because of patriotism and nationalism. They are both unifying and dividing forces, no one can deny that.

&gt;So the ""justification"" is simply. If you do not adapt, you won't get any jobs, have a hard time making any Swedish friends and becoming a positive part of the Swedish society.

So they don't have to shake hands or take off their niqab if they can sustain their lifestyle in Sweden (this means find employment or live off their relatives/partner)? Also, I don't see why 'making friends' should be obligatory for immigrants, nor do I see why they should be prohibited from entering Sweden or deported if they don't make Swedish friends.

So it's because they're religious it is a problem? The bolded statement suggests you think being Swedish = being atheist. Also the word 'PC' is being misused here, I think you mean the Swedish government is too *liberal* for you because laws on dress code are a distinctly authoritarian move.

Statsministern är inte direkt vald heller, det betyder inte att han inte är demokratiskt tillsatt för den sakens skull.

Om Sverige vore en republik skulle vi ha ett underligt statsskick jämfört med våra grannar, då majoriteten av de länder vi faktiskt gränsar är monarkier (Danmark, Norge). ;)

Inte för att mitt förslag är särskilt underligt. Det är den tyska modellen, i princip. Folket väljer en riksdag som sedan väljer först ett statsöverhuvud och sedan en regeringen. Det är inget konstigt med det. Ok att statsöverhuvudet får heta förste talman istället för president, men annars är det i praktiken ingen skillnad från sättet flera länder i Europa väljer sina. (Några exempel: Albanien, Italien, Tyskland, Grekland, Malta).

Jag är för övrigt övertygad om att kungahuset inom våran livstid kommer att avskaffas och att en republik kommer att instiftas. Det är rätt oundvikligt.

true,MarinP,null,null,"Well in Sweden ALL citizens as well as immigrants are taken care of due to our welfare system. That means that you can come to Sweden and never learn one single word of Swedish or work one single day and you'll still be taken care of until death by the government. All you have to do to become a neutralized Swede is to stay here for 7 years and that's it. You may be on welfare this whole time and never leave your apartment and let alone learn Swedish or anything about Sweden, you're now a bonafide Swede.

Look, I did not say they should be deported if they don't make friends. Just stating the simple fact that the foreigners who mix with Swedes and adapt to the culture do much much better than the ones who don't. The unemployment rate is very high for certain immigrant groups, Iraqis 60% and Somalis 80% and 90% of Muslim women. Now, if Sweden did not have it's welfare system or excluded non neutralized Swedes/raised the bar for becoming a Swede, there would be no problem. 
Well the problem with sharia zones etc might remain, also the extremely high population of foreigners in certain cities such as 46% in Södertälje and 41% in Malmö. A lot of Swedes simply don't want to become a minority in their own cities, especially not if the immigration happens to mean that the cities actually need to borrow money from the government to stay afloat due to all the money they must pay to support the immigrands. In my city we have 14% immigrants but the recieve 71% of all monetary aid.

Well the Swedish church has less then 1% active members and almost all Swedes are in fact atheists. Almost all believing christians in Sweden are immigrants. 

I am somwhere between socialist and liberal, but you must understand what the situation in Sweden is like before you pass any judgement. All eight represented parties of the government have refused to accept more immigrants to their cities/municipalities in over 70 places now. Not because they are racists or nationalists or fascists or whatever but because it is physically impossible to take in more people when they have no housing and no money to support them, no schools for the kids, no place on the hospitals etc and no support from the locals. They actually plan to build floating shelters in the Baltic Sea to accomodate refugees from Syria this year, we are already using military ships, cottages and abandonend sheds etc. 

I agree with your last point, and I think that would solve a lot of the problems here. Sweden is the problem more than anything. But guess what, even what you say here might get you labeled as a islamophobic fascist in Sweden. We have an extremely unhealthy climate for debates here. You either applaud the Swedish immigration politics or you are a scumbag racist. 

Open borders on the condition that they don't get access to welfare is something i support too, but you might (in certain cases) be ostraziced for even hinting at such a thing. I am black so I get away with critizising the politics, but my white friends get labeled all kinds of things and hence are afraid to speak up. That is what I meant by PC. Denmark actually asked the EU to send observers to the last Swedish election since we (our media) censor ""unwanted"" oppinions and work against the Swedish democrats by using slander, lies, outlocks and other undemocratic methods.

I kid you not, Sweden is gonna blow up pretty soon and I fear we will have a strong nationalist movement her and that it migt be quite irraitonal when it happens because the government has lost the trust of 14% of the people and plenty more (around 85%) are against the current immigration politics.

Even I have had shootings on the street where I live twice, and found blood in the elevator after a knifgfight and had police running with weapons drawn in my apartment (rather outside of it) and all these incidents included immigrants from the Middle East who in Sweden are overrepresented for violent crime with about 450%. Now I do not imply that people from Iraq or whatever are evil criminals. The problem is that we have not been allowed to discuss the obvious problems that we have seen and experienced first hand, so they have just grown. Also our laws are ridiculous. A brutal group rape will give you 3-5 years in prison and a ban from re-entering Sweden of 5-10 years. Even for murderers you can be out after 3-5 years and back in Sweden after 5-10 years. Our laws are lenient and the current goverment refuses to change anything about them, another reason the Swedish Democrats are getting more popular.

Keep your eyes on the Swedes my friend, we might very well drop the ball on this one and start to treat immigrants badly although Sweden is to blame for this mess. I for one will leave if shit gets ugly, but I really hope we can solve this before it gets too bad.

* Everyone claims to hate Berlusconi. However, when asked about the next elections a lot of people say they will vote for him even tough they know he won't keep any of his promises - They vote for him on principle, they don't want to vote for the left.

* The economy is fu**ed up. If you are in the North, manufacturing and constructions have just stopped. My cousin is a teacher and she says that 30% of families at kindergarten have withdrawn kids because they can't afford it. This is due to one/both parent/s being unemployed (note, kindergarten is subsidised and costs no more than 110EUR per month). 

* If you are 'professional' you are probably doing OK or *well*

* All my friends that are self-employed are complaining about late payments. Expect to have 40-60% of your credits on distress - A friend of mine owns a web company (employing 11 people), he says that invoices are paid on average at 97 days (rather than the contracted 30)

* More taxes than ever. All self-employed (i.e. accountants, doctors, bar / restaurant owners) are evading taxes. They all say that without evading taxes they won't be able to survive.

* If you are young, then you are probably under-employed/unemployed. If you are over 45 and you've lost you job you can forget about finding a new one.

* The situation in the South is even worst. I see the south getting closer and closer to North Africa / Greece rather than Europe.

* I don't see the country getting any better. The expectation is for the recession to continue during all of 2013.

Fat in food is good. You should eat it in moderation, obviously, but there's no reason to fear it.

This makes such pork very dry and very tasteless and boring when cooked. With chicken this problem is even more rampant since the standard has become that chicken should be low-fat, low-taste dryness and thus almost all chickens are bred to be and taste that way, with only a few rare people keeping older, tastier breeds.",0,1358602539,null,0,false,0,c7zqb76,t3_16vaj0,t1_c7zqb76,t1_c7zq0xq,null,1431012119,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

    Would you, if you believed your daughter to be a witch:

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Are you really suggesting that it's worth sending this girl back to horrible conditions just to squeeze out a little bit more growth?

That's a horrible accusation, so let's make this clear:  
**Nowhere** am I suggesting sending back families or children. This is what we're doing in Norway at the moment, and it's a completely misunderstood practice. 

My post above is not my personal viewpoint, but rather a clarification of the fact that conservatism in regards to immigration comes from people in one country and culture not wanting to spend resources on dealing with issues that aren't their own. 

My personal viewpoint is, like I said, that we shouldn't deport families and children or people who contribute to society by working or going to school. The government should instead focus their efforts on deporting criminals like those who commit rape in Oslo, axe murders in trams, and rob houses for profit. In my opinion, there is no reason to keep them in jail in Norway, but instead we should send them out of the country. Whether or not they stand trial in their home country is of less importance because removing them rids us of similar problems in the future. I'm not sure how relevant this is to Sweden, but it is what it's worth. 

**Naturally, this shouldn't apply to a family such as the one in the article, because removing a child from her parents by deporting them, would not be in the interest of the victim.**

true,Poebbel,BAVA,Bayern,"If you're not into skiing and such, come visit in the summer. There's not much to do here in winter except drinking mulled wine and most of the country doesn't even get snow, but mostly rain.

I'm from Munich and you should definitely visit the city. It's beautiful, clean and diverse. You could go to Neuschwanstein (very touristy, but your friends will expect you to go ;) ) and Dachau (can be depressing, but everybody should know about the horrible things that happened in the Third Reich), but each of these will require at least half a day. 

Spend an evening in a Biergarten and chat with the locals while eating delicious food (I'd recommend Chinesischer Turm or Hirschgarten), go out to eat in Schwabing or Maxvorstadt and sit outside enjoying a warm summer night. If you have the time, take the S-Bahn to Herrsching and hike up to Kloster Andechs, it's a beautiful monastery with a very nice Biergarten, the food and beer taste soooo good after a long walk (that would be my secret tip, seriously, do it!). It's located at the Ammersee, you could spend the rest of the day there and enjoy the countryside. 

There's a myriad of bars in Schwabing, Gärtnerplatzviertel and Glockenbachviertel, but I'd recommend to just buy a couple of beers or some wine (drinking in public is fine), get some snacks, a blanket and sit in the Englischer Garten. Nights are generally warm, if you bring a sweater you will be fine.

If you are into technology, visit the Deutsches Museum. It's not very interactive, but they have a lot of cool stuff to look at. The BMW Museum is also very nice, if you have a thing for cars.

If you want to do all that you should plan to stay 3 or 4 days, if you just want to see the city 2 days should be fine.

If you go up north from here, you could spend half a day in Ulm (140km north of Munich). It's a small city, but it has some beautiful architecture (Fischerviertel) and the highest church tower in the world (the Ulmer Münster). Rent a car and take the Autobahn 8 northwards from Munich, it's mostly free of speed limits. If you manage to get there on the second to last monday in July, you could experience Schwörmontag and Nabada. It's a holiday to celebrate democracy in the city that dates back to 1397 (heard you Americans like old stuff), thousands go down the Danube on self-made boats while being cheered on by even more people on the banks. The whole city is one big party, there are bands everywhere, everyone is dancing and drinking in the streets. It is absolutely amazing (and no one outside the general Ulm area knows about it, so another secret tip).

Oftern overlooked is Germany's seaside, the beaches on the North Sea and Baltic Sea are great, the Wattenmeer national park and the islands are stunningly beautiful with lots of wildlife, the sea food is great and if you combine it with a visit to Hamburg you also get some city life.

Some general remarks: Almost everybody learned English at some point in his life, if you also know a little bit of German you should be fine. Italian food is ubiquitous and you will find a great variety of German and international restaurants in every city. If not, there's always a McDonald's or Burger King nearby.

Racism is judging someone based on their race, tell me where did uat2d do that? He mentioned Swedish, which mind you, is a nationality, not a race. Mentioning that someone raised in Sweden isn't likely to do such barbarity is not racist at all, it's common sense. I bet over 75% of those who checked the title didn't expect someone born and raised in Sweden to be responsible for this, does that make them racist? Nope, unless you are very liberal about classifying people as racists...

Not to mention that the top 1% in Ireland pay 71% of the taxes, and the top 20% pay 82% of the taxes and whose taxes cover not only one of the most generous welfare systems going, but also mean that those who earn less get to pay significantly less taxes than their counterparts in the UK.

Yes, because it's not like there isn't enough genetic diversity in Europe, LOL! Dude, a population of half a million is big enough to maintain a viable gene pool, even 100k would probably be enough.

But it affects them as residents of the country. For EU nationals now getting citizenry of a different EU country is borderline pointless. Once they're resident, there's no reason they shouldn't be voting on matters in a country they might pay tax in the rest of their lives.

Furthermore, a country needs a centralised monetary policy and a single currency, and the EU is becoming a country. I'd say it was perhaps rushed into, but it has to happen eventually.

&gt;I don't like the idea of the CAP (if the EU is supposed to promote free trade, why are we trying so hard to limit imports?)

The unfortunate thing about CAP is that the honest reason it's there is to prevent mass unemployment, because essentially subsidisation of uneconomic farms for a generation is better than having millions of unemployed people for many generations (unemployment and underachievement is, cruely, an inheritable trait).

It also serves to ensure food security, but I agree it's protectionism and I look forward to a generation from now when it'll no longer be required, but for the time being it absolutely is for a variety of moderately complex social and economic reasons.

It isn't.

&gt;If you consider ""reasonable"" to be what a reasonable person might do in this situation

That's not how reasonable force is defined. The test was set down by the Privy Council in *Palmer v R* [1971] AC 814.

&gt;The defence of self-defence is one which can be and will be readily understood by any jury. It is a straightforward conception. It involves no abstruse legal thought. 

&gt;...Only common sense is needed for its understanding. It is both good law and good sense that a man who is attacked may defend himself. It is both good law and good sense that he may do, **but may only do, what is reasonably necessary.** But everything will depend upon the particular facts and circumstances. 

&gt;...It may in some cases be only sensible and clearly possible to take some simple avoiding action. Some attacks may be serious and dangerous. Others may not be. If there is some relatively minor attack it would not be common sense to permit some action of retaliation which was wholly out of proportion to the necessities of the situation. If an attack is serious so that it puts someone in immediate peril then immediate defensive action may be necessary. If the moment is one of crisis for someone in imminent danger he may have [to] avert the danger by some instant reaction. **If the attack is all over and no sort of peril remains then the employment of force may be by way of revenge or punishment or by way of paying off an old score or may be pure aggression. There may no longer be any link with a necessity of defence...** 

&gt;If a jury thought that in a moment of unexpected anguish a person attacked had only done what he honestly and instinctively thought was necessary that would be most potent evidence that only reasonable defensive action had been taken.

The EU doesn't have to become a country. What's the benefit? Your vote is now worth even less than it used to be. There are so many different ideas and cultures that I don't think it would work (assuming I even wanted it to). I think you're right in that stuff wont work unless you control both monetary and fiscal policy, but that's an necessary road to go down, how about we just don't join the Euro? Problem solved.

The CAP isn't going anywhere. Employment in agriculture is falling (source:http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/thumb/d/d4/Business_economy_overview._Breakdown_of_employment,_EU-27_(%25_of_total_employment).PNG/350px-Business_economy_overview._Breakdown_of_employment,_EU-27_(%25_of_total_employment).PNG), but the [CAP's budget is still as big as ever](http://www.inquit.com/images/uploads/CAPReformChart2010.png). This  wont change, the [CAP works for France and Germany](http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45223000/gif/_45223617_cap_spending_pie226.gif), France and Germany also have the largest proportion of MEPs. 

Maybe 2-3% of people work in agriculture? [Does 1.5% of it's GDP warrant 40% of the budget?](http://fullfact.org/factchecks/eu_spend_40_budget_farmers_subsidies_cap-28619) Let's not beat around the bush; it's more likely that France just wants to maintain it's own interests. 

Don't forget that these subsidies which allow the EU to sell us food at competitive prices are all paid for by us... So we're giving the EU money in order for it to give us food discounts. Kind of pointless. The only people it helps are tiny proportion of us that are agricultural workers. All the while the west is going to WTO meetings and telling the third world they need to open their markets to us, great stuff guys.

You can't seriously tell me that voting truly gives each person the same power? It's shown so beautifully in the USA's past election. A Maltan having 176 times the 'voting power' of a German isn't ridiculous. On the UNSC the UK has infinitely more voting power than India. Is that fair? No, does the system still manage to work?

First off, while this article seemed to suggest this practice is pan-Albanian, it is not. It only takes place in remote mountain communities. These communities are remnants of fiercely independent tribal groups that escaped high up into remote mountainous territory in order to escape Ottoman conquerors. 

Next, the article also seemed to suggest this practice was common. Again, even among those communities, it is a dying tradition. It remains a peculiarity of time gone by that was entrenched by isolation and that is being eradicated due to increased contact with urban Albania and the world at large.

Finally, the article seemed to suggest Albania was a strong patriarchal society. Just like the two previous points, such patriarchate exists in a dying form in some mountain communities, while the rest of Albania does not share in the idea. Those who have been to Albania or who know about it will tell you that the mark of communism, which espoused equality between the sexes and encouraged women to join the workforce, is much more pronounced than this pre-Ottoman medieval isolated tradition. 

So basically, the truth always escapes simplicity, but it does make for one hell of an article.

Now on the practice itself. There is definitely a feminist/patriarchy dimension to it. To understand it one must understand the history of the country. 

**Stop reading here unless you're looking for a lesson in Balkan history.** 

Albania, pretty much as a rule in history, has always been in some form of turmoil because of continual foreign driven grabs for its lands. The people of the country met this fate with a mix of assimilation, rebellion, fighting, or emigration. 

The particular reaction in the rugged North of Albania was fighting, which was facilitated by the terrain. This led to a creation of a warrior society that was perpetually at war. In such societies, where the ability to fight is so important, women often take a subordinate role and are seen primarily as factories for more soldiers. Also in such societies, and especially in this case, a strong government is not able to form and deliverance of services such as policing and justice are left up to the task of the individuals. In our case, our mountaineers adopted the medieval code of Lek Dukagjini (a medieval prince) as the law of the land. Therein we find laws concerning property, justice, etc. This code, lacking enforceability from an overarching power, led to *crazy* rules about property, such as this, and even crazier rules about murder, where the payment of blood must be made with blood by the victim's families. etc. These things are the only way that a descent into anarchy is avoided in dire, extreme living situations. Also the very important concept of *besa*, or 'word of honour', came out of this. I won't go into that massive concept at this time though. 

So basically, Albania's history is very very unfortunate, it's a *miracle* that the country exists at all. It is no surprise that majority Albanian Kosovo and other lands are outside of modern Albania given this history. But another, less looked at ramification of this history, are archaic traditions such as these.

Another, less explored avenue is that this tradition has, by strange coincidence, served women who identified as men an avenue to live their lives without fear of LGBT discrimination. It is difficult to prove this however because Albania remains largely a homophobic country and studying this topic would be near impossible.  

Hope that shed some light on this. 

**tl;dr This isn't as common as the article suggests, and is a dying tradition only found in remote mountain areas in the North. It is also an unfortunate externality of Albania's wretched history of perpetual war. ** ",0,1358619392,null,0,false,0,c7ztzu9,t3_16vlrj,t1_c7ztzu9,t3_16vlrj,null,1431013856,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;The EU doesn't have to become a country. What's the benefit?

Numerous benefits. Consolidation of power, increase in efficiency of trade, lower overall military spending for a considerably more effective military (Currently we spend the equivalent to the entire GDP of Finland on 27 militaries, 25 of which are varying levels of useless), not to mention the EU's strong track record of protecting the rights of its citizenry where national governments have failed. Ultimately though the world is becoming made up of countries much larger than any EU country, the USA, India, economic blocks like ASEAN, ECOWAS, Mercosaur. If we want to stay able to deal with them on an equal footing we need that bulk too.

&gt;Your vote is now worth even less than it used to be.

No, it's not, because though there are more people, there is more power and money.

&gt;There are so many different ideas and cultures that I don't think it would work (assuming I even wanted it to).

I don't see why not. The United Kingdom works and we have different ideas and different political cultures.

&gt;The CAP isn't going anywhere.

I never said the CAP was going to be gone in 5 years, I said in a generation, that was quite important so I hope you got that. Employment in agriculture falling is *precisely* what we want, a slow and sound transition for the few percent of the EU population who work in agriculture into either very high efficiency profitable farming, or out of agriculture into other professions.

&gt;Let's not beat around the bush; it's more likely that France just wants to maintain it's own interests.

Inevitably so, the French are very individualist within the EU. That does not mean that their own interests do not accord with our own though, which in this case they do, at least for the time being.

&gt;Don't forget that these subsidies which allow the EU to sell us food at competitive prices are all paid for by us... So we're giving the EU money in order for it to give us food discounts.

No no no, these are not food discounts. You don't seem to understand. We pay money to our governments, who give it to the EU, who give it to farmers. We pay *more* for the food precisely because if at the supermarket you could buy the £1 Argentine beef or the £5 German beef then German farmers would be out of business in a week. Obviously the disparity is nowhere near this big, but the whole point is that we pay *more* for food in order to ensure a stable generational transition for farmer's children towards professions and roles in society which are profitable in a globalised world.

You have to consider the product of maybe 4-5% of the households in the EU waking up overnight to unemployment. Farmers tend to lack university degrees, are increasingly middle aged, and have, frankly, as a group, poor prospects for re-employment, especially in the economy as it stands. Given that children of unemployed people have considerably worse outcomes than children of families where one or more parent is working, it's far better to subsidise these farms for a generation, ensure that their kids are more likely to grow up to be succesfull (although not farmers) and then gradually close down the CAP over maybe a 15-20 year period allowing farmers left to consolidate into massive high efficiency farms as others sell.

There is a lot of wisdom in this policy, it's just it can't be openly explained to the people of the EU because essentially what it's doing is ensuring that the death of mass agriculture in the EU is less painful than it would otherwise be.

&gt;You can't seriously tell me that voting truly gives each person the same power? It's shown so beautifully in the USA's past election.

Sorry, in what regard?

&gt;A Maltan having 176 times the 'voting power' of a German isn't ridiculous.

It absolutely is. That's completely undemocratic.

&gt;On the UNSC the UK has infinitely more voting power than India. Is that fair?

Many would argue no, although the UNSC was never set up to be a system of univeral suffrage based on right to self-determination, it's a part of an IO which placed the most powerful nations on the planet into a council in order to safeguard the security of the earth. I'm afraid the comparison just doesn't work.

&gt;Votes don't have to be based on population, it drowns out the little guys.

I don't understand how you can justify this, but then I realise that's because you're thinking of countries. I'm not, I'm thinking of people. Forget the idea of nation states within the EU for a second, each person is a citizen, and people will vote for what's best for *them*, not for their country. There are no small guys or big guys, there's just 500 million people. The fact that countries exist within it still means that individual interests may correlate with those of the country, but they are not the same thing, and the faster we get away from nation state interests determining individual interests the better.

&gt;What I want to see in the EU is a celebration of the little guys just as much as the big guys.

Historical and archeological studies that go back before the 19th C are inconclusive.

What is known for sure is the history of the region in the last century. We know for sure Kosovo at the start of the last century was more Serbian than it is now. To be exact, the population breakdown was roughly 50/50. The Serbian state between the wars attempted a colonization program which was not successful in settling large numbers of Serbs in the area, but was successful in breaking the Albanian fighting spirit until post-communism. During that time, Albanian birth rates were high (as is normal of poorer, disadvantaged groups) and Serbian birth rates were low (as is normal of more affluent groups).

1. Dismantling the EU is pretty much out of the question now. It's been too useful to too many people and countries to get rid of it now. Europe has never been more prosperous or peaceful than under the EU.

2. The EU shrinking is slightly more likely than its dismantling. It would not be entirely surprising should some countries (the UK most prominent among them), leave the EU. I think the EU shrinking is far less likely however, as nationalist sentiment is the only real argument against unification. The single market and other benefits the EU brings still outweighs remaining outside the EU (except for Switzerland). In fact, it is probably more likely that the EU will continue to expand. The Balkans are the main focus of expansion for now. Turkey has a long road ahead of it, as do the Caucasus states, though of those three, only Georgia and Armenia have made it an explicit desire to join the EU.

3. Federate. This is by far the most likely future for the EU. It has really been the end goal of unification and integration attempts for many people from the beginning of the Coal and Steel Community. It's become increasingly evident to just about everyone that the EU has become more important in world affairs than any of its member states could hope to achieve alone. It's economic and demographic weight make it a great power in its own right. Further integration will lead to greater domestic and foreign power for the EU, and will allow the EU to become more and more democratic. It will likely evolve into a parliamentary system like most of its member states. However, it is very likely that several coherent, codified tiers will emerge in the process of federation. There will be a core of countries that federate first. This is most likely to be the Eurozone, due to the necessity for a common fiscal policy. Outer tiers are likely to include the more Euroskeptic countries, the UK most prominently. Over time, however, these tiers will probably started to blend together again, and the countries on the outside will increasingly find themselves closer to the core tier. This will probably happen over a long time and as a result of self-interest and a desire to seek greater power in the continental order.

Should federation occur successfully, the EU will become more than just a sovereign state. It will become a model for other regional organizations. This would be very welcome indeed, as it could lead to age old prejudices and hatreds dying with time, and would facilitate economic and political growth and cooperation.

From [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9die):

&gt; **Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers** (English: Encyclopaedia or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts and Crafts) was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It was edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert.

&gt; The Encyclopédie was an innovative encyclopedia in several respects. Among other things, it was the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many named contributors, and it was the first general encyclopedia to lavish attention on the mechanical arts. Still, the Encyclopédie is famous above all for representing the thought of the Enlightenment. According to Denis Diderot in the article ""Encyclopédie"", the Encyclopédie's aim was ""to change the way people think"". He wanted to incorporate all of the world's knowledge into the Encyclopédie and hoped that the text could disseminate all this information to the public and future generations.

&gt; The Encyclopédie played an important role in the intellectual ferment leading to the French Revolution. *""No encyclopaedia perhaps has been of such political importance, or has occupied so conspicuous a place in the civil and literary history of its century. It sought not only to give information, but to guide opinion,""* wrote the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica.

&gt; While many contributors to the Encyclopédie had no interest in radically reforming French society, the Encyclopédie as a whole pointed that way. The Encyclopédie denied that the teachings of the Catholic Church could be treated as authoritative in matters of science. The editors also refused to treat the decisions of political powers as definitive in intellectual or artistic questions. Some articles talked about changing social and political institutions that would improve their society for everyone. Given that Paris was the intellectual capital of Europe at the time and that many European leaders used French as their administrative language, these ideas had the capacity to spread.

Are you not familiar with what happened over the constitution and then the Lisbon Treaty?  

Or does the irony of the UK, when using powers afforded and agreed under treaties, a position they've consistently argued since 1992 but is treated like a pariah for exercising them, not register?

&gt;Yugoslavia failed, but now its successor states are joining the EU one by one. 

Nice, we'll just wash over the ethnic cleansing and the two world wars that came about from the Sick Man of Europe at the time, and that the same mistake is being repeated.  They're not moving to something closer to the Statute of Rome, they're now in the process of moving further away from it.  It's the UK that's arguing for such a review to original intentions.

We'll just pretend that things are getting better now and that the EU's not in the process of repeating the same explosive mistake.

&gt;The EU has not been built on conquest or coercion, but by...

So you *aren't* aware how the Treaty of Lisbon came about, because that most definitely is designed to enact the same constitution which countries voted down, and to circumvent further referendum.  Everyone knows, or should know, that one thing that prevents a struggling economy from fixing itself is the joint currency.  That Greece can't drop out of the Euro without it's Euro denominated debt going through the ceiling.  Everybody should also know that many countries have been allowed to opt out, some who didn't have the opt out have successfully put it off until the EU has given up on them joining, others are still putting it off, and yet still all new members are obligated to join it.  Straight off, coercion. There's no reason for it other than to mark a point of no practical return.

How you can say there hasn't been coercion, or that it isn't even ongoing, is incredible.  You must not be aware.  

&gt;The EU has been anything but a failure. It has its problems, but to equate it to Yugoslavia is doing it and its history a disservice.

I'm just going to come out and say it.  I don't think you know the history behind it.  At all.

Talking about Federalism and the coercion surrounding it, and Balkanisation and how Yugoslavia was formed, is not by any means a lazy comparison, and when you say it is to 'temper nationalism', you'd have to be blind to not see that it is having the completely opposite effect.  If anything it is polarizing and inviting fracture.  

You should already be able to name the countries that have had significant shifts, rises in extremism, and fuel added to breakaway regions.  You should also be able to name the countries pushing for further fiscal integration but which have regularly broken existing rules - even though significant portions of their own populations describe the single currency as a mistake.

They speak different languages, let a lone the inevitable problem will occur if a Serb is commanded by a Kosovan or a Englishman by a Frenchman? Most would get a long with it, some wouldn't. 

In regards to 'we need to stick together', Italy has a larger economy than India. Germany has a larger economy than the whole of Mercosur put together. I'm not sure what you're talking about. I keep saying this, I'm for the EU. However we don't need it for defence, we have a powerful enough Armed forces, plus NATO. We don't need it to negotiate our trade agreements, we have excellent agreements with many commonwealth states (IMO the CAP only hinders our ability to operate as a global trading nation) and any nation who doesn't want to trade with the UK will only be shooting themselves in the foot. Our [human rights record](http://www4.carleton.ca/cifp/app/gdp_ranking.php) isn't bad either.

Time for the CAP again. I understand what a subsidy is. Say the German produces beef at 5 times the expense of an Argentinian, the EU gives the German money so now instead of selling it at $5 he can sell it at the more competitive $1.50 and still survive. There are multiple ways of saying it, bribe to lower price, subsidy, funded discount, whatever. So as I said, we give the EU money, we get discounted food. 

I pointed out the number of agricultural workers has fallen but the CAP budget hasn't really. In 10 years (97-07) the agriculture, forestry, fishing &amp; hunting sector shrank by 27.5%. That's significant. 

The CAP isn't a transitional allowance, it's a way of making the EU worthwhile for Western Europe. Eastern Europe is one of the markets that causes us to 'need' the CAP! 

Now onto voting etc.

You say people vote as individuals, but that's not true. Just a short while before you were talking about how the French are looking after France's interests. People vote for their country's benefit. I don't vote for an EMP to represent my corner of England, he goes to represent the UK. 

I tried to forget the idea of nation states within the EU but I couldn't do it for very long. I get the feeling you want the EU to be a country where I'm not British, I'm European. That won't happen. There's a noticeable gap between Londoners and Mancuians, the difference is even bigger between Athenians and Glaswegians. The EU is a collection of member states. Many people in the past have tried to merge Europe, it keeps splitting back up again. It seems to be the natural way of things, the 'equilibrium' if you will.

A Maltan having 176 times the voting power of a German is undemocratic, I agree. It doesn't make it ridiculous. Smell the cheese, when has your vote ever made a difference anyway? Our perceived democratic world isn't very fair. It's better than a dictatorship, but it's still very flawed. This is what I meant when I talked about the states. If you voted in Cali or Texas your vote was insignificant, if you voted in Florida or Ohio then your vote had a massively higher chance of inflicting change. Take New Hampshire and California. NH was 40 thousand votes from swinging, CA was 2.3 million. I'm no Nate Silver but an NH voter might have had a ~60 times higher chance of affecting the outcome than a CA voter. 

I don't want the EU to attempt (and fail) to represent me, it will never be what I'd like, realistically I have too little influence. I want the EU to work for the UK and its other member states, I'm perfectly happy if that means some dude in Malta statistically has a higher chance of influencing the world than I do, at the end of the day none of it is down to either of us.

Think about it . . when something is viewed as a conspiracy you automatically assume its for ""those weird people"" . . that is because you AnalKidFucker are programmed to do so.

Most of those you listed are stupid conspiracies, possibly some of them MIGHT have some basis in truth . . but it is impossible to prove.

Either way if you were a powerful government and DID just pull off a conspiracy the 1st thing you would do is push a bunch of bullshit theories onto the internet/TV to make the actual logical theories seem stupid.

The only one you listed in those that I can 100% agree is real is the MK-Ultra program. Some people from the 70's Mk-Ultra program who have come forward have stated that the name MK-ultra was scrapped decades ago. It has been re-named likely numerous times but there is no doubt the CIA has there hands on some incredible psychological experiments. After all one of the main roles of the CIA is to shape public opinion, it would be in there interest to have some advanced private experiments.

Ok, so now your brain has already triggered a reaction ""86mitso is CRAZY!"" he believes in MK-ULTRA! Only Conspiracy nuts believe that! All conspiracy are for crazy people! Conspiracy's do not actually exist!!

true,iheartnickleback,BULG,Bulgaria,"Ok, here's what's up - First off, the guy staring down the barrel is Ahmed Dogan, a Bulgarian of Turkish ethnicity. He got his start in the late 80's and early 90's as more or less a domestic terrorist. At the time, the Bulgarian (communist) government was doing some pretty dickish stuff to the Turkish population of Bulgaria, including changing their names and threatening/otherwise harassing them. This guy, Dogan, in retaliation to the regime, blew up a fuckin' train, full of women and children and everything. He was thrown in jail, and later sentenced to 10 years. HOWEVER, as the communist government in Bulgaria crumbled apart in '89, he was pardoned, less than a year after being sentenced, and he immediately founded a political party, and entered the newly-democratized government structure.

Here's what you need to know about his party - it is completely ethnically-based. They win seats in parliament because 100% of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria is behind them. They gain even more seats through election fraud - bussing non-Bulgarian Turks into the country to vote for them every election. Dogan has gone on to do even more scandalous stuff, which he was acquitted of recently, and his party is actually pretty influential - their support is in the teens, and they were part of the ruling coalition for 8 years, until 2009.

This is why this assassination attempt matters - Dogan knows that the fate of his political influence lies in the hands of ethnic Turks in Bulgaria. Any threats on him, or any sort of violence against Turks will be seen as ethnic aggression, and gain him much support, and many more votes in the upcoming parliamentary elections. Ideally, these aggression would come from ATAKA - Bulgaria's nationalist, right-wing, insane fringe party. They have had their sights on this guy (metaphorically, of course) for years. That is not the case, however. This is what doesn't make sense about this whole scenario - he was attacked by another Turkish-Bulgarian, wielding a non-lethal gas gun (Maybe lethal at this range, I don't know..). This means one of two things - either this was just a super-shitty assassination attempt, the motives behind which are murky and uncertain, or, and I feel this is the more likely case - he was hired by Dogan's party to carry out that botched attempt, with the sole purpose of gaining support in an election year. Of course, it's confusing why they would hire a Turk instead of a racist Bulgarian, but I'm sure the next few days we'll find out more about this guy and his motives.",0,1358628579,null,0,false,0,c7zwie2,t3_16vivr,t1_c7zwie2,t1_c7zs9mv,null,1431015064,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

As the biosphere collapses under the weight of over consumption and global warming, democracy gets suspended indefinitely. Markets become controlled and eventually irrelevant. Capitalism morphs into a fascist neofeudalism.

There will be no free press and information will be controlled. Small inner wars will be fought and easily won. Separatism will be controlled but terrorism will remain abundant. Starvation, disease and violence will make up the periphery of Europe. The inner core however, lives pretty well.

Europe will likely face other Eastern and Western alliances over resources and other interests. When a full blown war is no longer avoidable, everything goes to shit and all these territories dissolve into chaos.

If your nonsens was true the Somalis here would not have an unemployment rate of 80%. Reality begs to differ, and I've got more info for you regarding Minnesota:

From ""Super Economy"":

The average income of the working age adults in Minnesota is $38.000. 

The average income of working age Somali immigrants in Minnesota is $13.800, or about one third(!). As a comparison, one third of the average American income is Mexico. 

More than half of Somali immigrants in Minnesota are below the poverty line. 

Only one half of Somali immigrants in Minnesota work. 

Those who work earn $21.000 per year, compared to $46.000 for Minnesotans on average. 

The median income of Somalis that work is $12000 per year, or about 9000 Swedish kronor per month (using 9 kronor to a dollar as a PPP-adjusted conversion rate). 

The conclusion that this data tells us is that Somali immigration to Minnesota has been a complete disaster from the perspective of Minnesota. 

A group that earn one third of average income cannot possibly be a net contributor to the public sector (in the U.S those with low income pay virtually no taxes, yet consume public services). 

A group that earns one third of average income and where half live in poverty is not a success story for other countries to be inspired by. 

One consolation is that we find that 51% of Somalis in Minnesota work, compared to about 20% in Sweden. Is that not at least a partial success story? 

Minnesota in 2008 has very little labor regulations, low taxes, and much less generous public services than Sweden (although contrary to public perception they do still have some welfare and public services). It is more of a brutal sink-or-swim climate for immigrants than Sweden will ever be in my lifetime. 

Yet, half of Somalis don’t work. ",0,1358635732,null,0,false,0,c7zyfgs,t3_16sanw,t1_c7zyfgs,t1_c7zwlsw,null,1431016020,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

There is a problem with some equipment, which is old and prone to failings, and the lack of money to repair them (I've heard some of the helicopters have been cannibalized for spare parts). About 40-50% of the equipment is not in working order at any given time (stats [here](http://questions.assemblee-nationale.fr/q13/13-98826QE.htm) for the Armée de Terre (ground + close air support)), I think the numbers are about the same for the other armies.

Now, for the ""paper tiger"" part... The first point is: what do you want out of your army. There is no direct threat to France, and anyway it is inside the NATO (so that attacking France would imply attacking the US, and nobody wants that). There is no need for a large army able to compete with Russia or China. The missions of the French army are rather (among others):

* nuclear deterrence (via submarines or aircrafts-launched bombs);

* smaller interventions, mostly in Africa (Côte d'ivoire last year, Mali today...) and in the Middle-East, often under UN mandate (Liban).

The ressources are still lacking. For instance, France is not able to control its whole EEZ (which is the second largest in the world). As for interventions, the worst points are the transports of troops and fuel. This is why, I guess, the US have lent some of their means in Mali.

A lot of French soldiers laid down their arms thinking that their government would be unable to compete with the German without the help of foreign countries.

The one downer is that it is not cheap to party in Madrid.  Most of the good bars or clubs tend to be on the pricey side of things.

If you are already registered with AIRE, you should receive your ballot in the mail in the next few weeks. You'll then have to send it back to the embassy via regular mail (you'll find the instructions in the envelope, I suppose).

It's not as known as the big cities like Cologne, Berlin or Munich, but to me, that's what makes it special.
We have a really beautiful historic city center ([example here](http://img.fotocommunity.com/Architektur-Bauwesen/Architektur-bei-Nacht/Muenster-Prinzipalmarkt-a18514941.jpg) and [here](http://www.bilderbuch-muenster.de/bilder/m%25C3%25BCnster_centrum_kiepenkerl_platz_d1e1315764_978x1304xin.jpeg)) The first picture is the Prinzipalmarkt, which would be the main road of the city district. It has lots and lots of shops, bars, cafés and such. Although some are quite expensive, but you'll find something that suits you. The second one is a bit down the road, it's an old bar called Kiepenkerl. There's a story to that name, but I will skip on that, except someone's interested.
I'm trying not to go into too much detail, but if you're interested, just PM me and I'll give out more information.
Just one last bite before I leave: In 2004, Münster was awarded the ""Most Liveable city in the world"". I hope I translated that correctly, had to do some kind of a blind flight there. However, you can't miss out a city like this, right?
I'm probably having some stress in May due to my upcoming graduation, but if you're coming to my hometown, or are interested in more info, just PM me and I'll answer your questions as well as I can.

 Just explain your situation and offer to order a case of wine + one of their glasses. In my experience most medium-sized enterprises are happy to help if you are polite enough and talk to the right guy...

Another strategy would be to pretent that you are a potentional major client and need some free trial + merchandise before you´ll order their wine for your restaurant, hotel etc...

The writers of article try to predict the the electricity consumption for the period 2007 to 2017. Now Belgium depends for a large part of their electricity supply on France and The Netherlands. 

France guarentees a energy supply of 1.6 GW in 2008 (Federale Overheidsdienst Economie, 2009) and the article predicts that in 2020 the energy demand from Belgium to France will be around 1.9 GW. If the guaranteed energy supply from France isn't raised in this period of 13 years, we need an alternative energy source.

Also, at the end, the article has a number of scenarios in which during the period of 2006 to 2010 the estimated peak values are just under 300 MW. 

So the 300 MW the island produces could be used to produce enough energy to either delay the energy demand we need from France for a couple hours in the future or to cover the peak moments in the evening and morning.

Note: All the assumptions I made could be wrong. No source I found supports the relationship between the capacity of new island and the 300 MW extra enegy we need from France in the near future, nor the energy we need during the peak moments.

This is a very difficult question and a political mine field. It is what makes dismantling or more likely a split into several smaller federations more likely in my opinion, because this must be confronted with a powerful and compelling vision that guarantees that none of the current nation states are given preference over the others. If we are to federate then the nations must be dismantled first split into smaller regions than are then reintegrated otherwise the big countries will be seen as in charge and that is not in anyone's interest unless they want rebellions and eventually in many years time war. Political equality and fairness to all populations in Europe should be a requirement for integration, not a huge patch job of badly written and implemented half-solutions leading to an elite of bureaucrats ruling over the population because they are not trusted to be smart enough to decide themselves.

true,la_pluie,null,null,"I am a current student at AUP and I've been studying here for 3 years. 

&gt; it is a private, expensive, not too selective college

* Yes, AUP is very expensive but there are reasons to it. 

First of all, AUP is a non-profit organization, meaning that any money it receives goes back to the school itself. Although the Admissions Office receives many applications each year, AUP does not have a high enrollment rate as a consequence of the high tuition, thus rendering the school less selective about its students. One must factor in the cost of hiring faculty, staff, and the general maintenance of the buildings itself. AUP is located in the 7éme arrondissement - one of the most expensive districts in Paris in terms of real estate. For that, you get safety and the bragging rights of having your ""campus"" next to many of the city's most famed landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Invalides, Ecole Militaire, Pont Alexandre.

&gt; where you pay a lot to learn/work very little.. 

Since English is often not the first language of many AUP students, grading isn't as harsh for any writing related courses (English, Communications). Typical papers for undergrads range from 10-20 pages. Politics students receive many readings per week (50-100 pages). Economics and business courses are typically difficult.

In terms of academics, AUP is fantastic in certain departments like Politics, Communications, and Business. This is because most students who attend AUP seek to study those particular subjects. Their isn't enough of a vested interested by many students in our Computer Science, Mathematics, and Science department, which may explain its ""weakness."" 

I've always been jealous of Art History students because they go on field trips to museums all the time because it pertains to their study. However, other departments offer ""study trips"" related to the courses. i.e. - this year we offer: Georgia (the country!) for World Politics, Kazakhstan for International Business, Prague for History, Antwerp for Journalism amongst a dozen other opportunities. 

&gt; Most of student body is composed of diverse students from all around, but what most of them have in common, is their rich parents, lots of rich kids trying to get a degree in AUP. 

It is very true that AUP is very diverse - we have 95 nationalities represented here! Just walking down the hall, you may hear over 5 different languages. However, everyone speaks English.. Although some may have an accent :P

1) **The Study Abroaders** - These are the students who are just in Paris for one semester/one year and its often them who give AUP its *bad reputation*. Because they are studying abroad, they usually just need to ""Pass"" the class without a care to their actual grade. Many of these ""kids"" are Americans who have never lived abroad before and are most likely underage back in the States. Thus when they move here and realize they can drink freely and go out every night without parental supervision - they go bat shit crazy. Loud, belligerent, disrespectful - a semi-permenant tourist. As a full time student speaking about them, I think they're occasionally fun to be around because they're still so filled with the wonder and magic of Paris.

2) **The Rich Kids** - These students can afford the tuition, no problem. If you want to build connections then AUP is for you. Your peers will be children of diplomats, CEOs, and celebrities from all around the world. They wear designer clothes to class and get picked up by their chauffeur afterwards. They live in the biggest flats and eat at restaurants every night. They party in the most exclusive clubs and don't blink an eye to getting that 500 euro table. While this may be a bit disconcerting - not all are so extravagant with their wealth. Once you get over the income divide, you might find that some of them are really down to earth. One of my closest friends last year was a princess of a Middle Eastern country - we spent time playing Magic the Gathering!

3) **The Full-Time Students** - This is where I, and a good half of the students, would fall in. We're the AUPers who usually come from lower/middle-class families and who depend on Financial Aid and Scholarships. We live in small little shoeboxes (*chambre de bonnes* - 10-15 square meters ""apartments"" with no toilets/showers/elevator). To get by, these students will get jobs like babysitting, tutoring, or bartending. Although we may or may not speak French perfectly, we've adapted to the Parisian lifestyle enough to at least blend in. You'll find that we're the bitter ones at AUP after years of dealing with inefficient French bureaucracy. You'll most often find us in random little bars around Paris that we swear is the best.. or at the school bar, ""the Amex,"" drinking our sorrows away with cheap wine and beer.

Und ich finde eigentlich, gerade so Sachen wie Atomenergie oder Großprojekte sind prima geeignet für Volksabstimmungen. Eben weil es da keine objektiv richtige Antwort gibt - entweder man ist bereit, ein Risiko einzugehen, um relativ billig an Energie zu kommen, oder nicht. Entweder man ist bereit, einen Bahnhof für recht viel Steuergeld in den Untergrund zu verlegen, oder eben nicht. Das sind beides keine Sachen, die von oben aufoktroyiert werden sollten, finde ich? Details zur Umsetzung von Großprojekten sind natürlich nichts für Volksabstimmungen, das gehört in die Hand von Architekten und Ingenieuren, aber das will ja auch keiner?

Dass Volksabstimmungen gewisse Schranken haben sollten, ist geschenkt, ich glaube, das sieht fast niemand anders. Eine Volksabstimmung, die offen in Grundrechte eingreift oder selbige abschafft, sollte natürlich nicht möglich sein.

true,throwmeaway76,null,null,"Here's my answer, as a Portuguese student:

In Portugal, most kids usually go to kindergarten until they're 6, when they reach first grade. Then, from the first grade to the ninth grade, the syllabus is the same for everyone. Students are now taught English from the first grade, but that's recent, it used to be fifth grade. Otherwise, there's History-Geography, Maths, Music (I was only taught the flute, I can't play it anymore, not that I ever could), Portuguese, Phys-Ed, Nature Sciences and a general Arts subject, from the fifth grade onwards there's Physics-Chemistry and Project Area, for group work. Also, from the 7th to 9th grade we pick a second foreign language, usually French, but Spanish and German aren't unheard of. In 9th grade we choose between Visual Arts (technical drawing, basically) and Technological Arts (sort of like Shop in the US, I guess).

I'll choose Maths because it's universal: we're taught Arithmetics and SI units from the 1st to 4th grade. Then, by the 7th grade we should know elementary algebra and the Pythagorean theorem and in the 8th or 9th grade we learn about the Quadratic Formula and the really basic Trig functions (sine, cosine and tangent).

In the 10th year, which is the first year of high school, we have to choose our general area. There's Science and Technology, Economical Sciences, Humanities, Letters and some other courses, like professional courses. Unless you picked Letters, you always get Maths (where Humanities students have Matemática B, which is more about statistics). Everyone gets three years of Portuguese, two years of Philosophy and three years of Phys-Ed.

In my case, as a Science and Technology student, I had to choose two biennial subjects between Biology-Geology, Physics-Chemistry and Geometry. 10th and 11th year maths is basically just Functions (with derivatives and such), on the plane and in space, with some statistics thrown in. 12th year maths has probability and trigonometry along with functions.

Now, I'm in the first year of University, at a Health Sciences course. Over the first semester, we have Mathematics, Cell Biology, Chemistry and Human Anatomy. In Math, we had Linear Algebra (just basic matrices, how to solve them, and just a tiny bit about vectors) and Calculus (integrals and differential equations).

I fail to see the connection between cooperation in Europe and stagnant median wages.

Cynics may remark that the push to get women into the workplace has been so successful not because it is their right but because capitalism cannot survive without them being there.

Nevertheless, your remark about peace and NATO is incredibly ill-informed. The peace that the EU has facilitated is certainly supported by NATO, but it is *unheard* of historically to see a period of almost 70 years without a war in Western Europe.

1°) Je ne pense pas qu'existait en 1796 la notion légale de génocide, de crime contre l'humanité ni même celle qui s'appliquerait plus logiquement si ces faits se faisaient aujourd'hui : celle de crime de guerre. Ces notions sont (il me semble) apparues au 20e siècle avec les conventions de Genève. Légalement, je ne suis pas sur que ce genre de reconnaissance puisse tenir la route.

2°) Moralement, en fait, cette loi s'appuie sur une pratique que je trouve assez contestable : celle qui fait du legislateur l'autorité qui reconnait ce qui est un génocide et ce qui ne l'est pas. Ça en fait une question politique, alors qu'elle devrait être avant tout juridique. À l'origine ça partait de l'idée de rendre délictueuse la négation des génocides officiels, mais ce genre de proposition montre comment on peut détourner une telle loi.

3°) Il me semble probable que le but de ce projet de loi est de montrer l'absurdité et le parti pris de la reconnaissance de génocides ""officiels"".

If you listen to the majority of natives, however, they will tell you NOT to run Pamplona. For good reason-- it's extremely dangerous. In fact, most Spaniards have never run at Pamplona though they may have participated in other, smaller ""encierros"" in their hometowns. You will mostly run with other foreigners, but the few natives that DO run, have invaluable experience. 
Plan on being there a couple of nights so you have a few opportunities to run. The run occurs every day at 8AM during the festival. Study the course. Study bull anatomy. For instance, it is not the same to run with the bulls at Deadman's curve the start of Calle Estafeta than it is to run with them at Telefonica (the last curve in to the bullring). Bull anatomy makes them FASTER on the uphill slope than the downhill. The course is 800 meters long, slightly uphill and the bulls average just over 2 minutes. Think about how fast that is. 
The most important thing: Running with the Bulls is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done and I've been shot at in combat. It will change your life. Have fun, bro!

Jews were considered a ""non-white"" race just 50 years ago. There is no good reason to separate discrimination based on race from discrimination based on *ideas of* race, and that's what's at play here.

I don't really care what ""most people"" think, because in this case they're wrong. Ethnography is a science, and it defines its terms quite clearly.

My point is that you will often make assumptions about which culture someone is from based on their appearance, **and** you will just as often hold misconceptions about any foreign culture, because you are not an anthropologist who has spent enough time with each culture to be able to make value judgments for all of them.

Indeed, an anthropologist who doesn't share your background may easily make the argument that it is typical of Western, especially British, culture, which mostly consists of white people, to consider their own culture superior to any other, and that this is part of the explanation for the exceedingly bloody history of our culture, as well as our historical desire to conquer and subjugate all foreign, ""inferior"" cultures.",0,1358691085,null,0,false,0,c808zsk,t3_16v1pn,t1_c808zsk,t1_c808dok,null,1435641171,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0
