You do know that 35% of Croatia was under Serbian control? That the country was cut in half at Maslenica? That there were mass expulsion of Croatians in Krajina?

I am not trying to start flame war here, but whatever happened has a timeline and if we are going to talk about Serbs leaving Krajina than we need to talk about Croats being expelled from it in 1991t o1995.

Also .... Croatian army didn't expel anyone. Serbs **left before we entered the Krajina**, while Serb forces forced Croats out in 1991.

Oh ..... here we come again .....

Do you know what was offered to Serbs in Croatia in 1995 under ""Z-4"" plan? Country within country, bigger autonomy than Kosova or Vojvodina had. Krajina would be basically different country.

**SERBS REFUSED**

We accepted.

Americans got fucking annoyed and allowed us to start ""Oluja"".


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-4_plan

Just read ..... and please complain again that Serbs weren't offered autonomy:

&gt;The plan was meant to allow for the reintegration of the Republic of Serbian Krajina into Croatia by offering wide-ranging autonomy through most of Serbian Krajina. In addition, the plan called for the return of all Croatian refugees. However, the plan would have required UNPROFOR to extend its mandate in order to implement the agreement, and the Croatian constitution would have to have been amended to accommodate the requirements of autonomy.

Some aspects of the proposed autonomy included the following:

- Total monetary independence, which would have included fiscal policy and a separate currency pegged to the Kuna.
- Krajina would have been a free trade area with no tariffs; this was meant to encourage economic growth in Krajina.
- Elements of statehood including a coat of arms, flag, anthem, and police.
- Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia would not have been included as part of the autonomous Krajina but would have undergone a separate reintegration process and would have had the presence of international troops for a period of five years. It was intended that this region would not be given a special status. Croatia would have regained control of the region after 5 years, in which an agreement with Croatian authorities would have been reached and the region would have been demilitarized (with the exception of a 5 kilometer zone along the international border and the Danube).
- The 11 municipalities that had Serbian majorities in the 1981 census would have been given a special status and been called “Serbian Krajina”. Pursuant to constitutional law, these municipalities formed the districts of Krajina and Glina.
- The constitution and laws of the Republic of Croatia would have been valid on the territory of Krajina, but they would have to have been approved and implemented by the local authorities.
- Krajina would have had an election of the president of Krajina.
- Krajina would have been demilitarized and the Croatian army could enter it only if called by the president of Krajina.
- No official in Krajina would have been responsible to any authority in Croatia.

At Sochaux, between football and Peugeot, the death of proletarian spirit?

Peugeot and FC Sochaux are the two lungs of the Montbeliard region. But the car firm is delocalizaing and the club is last in Ligue 1 (at the time the article was written). Journey in the ""Doubs"" in a 206 (http://www.motorstown.com/images/peugeot-206-at-01.jpg)

&gt; Its only here that you can still see 309 or 205 Peugeot cars

When we enter in ""Montbeliard"" we are warned at the entry. Here, it is Peugeott. And its football club, the FC Sochaux. Last Wednesday, we got on the 206 (obviously) of Benjamin, president of the supporter group ""Joyriders"". Direction the training ground to understand what is happening at the last placed of Ligue 1.

Around 40 supporters are chatting about the sacking of the coach. Despite the bad results, Mecha Bazdarevic, very attached to the region, had the support of the old timers for having been the brilliant play maker of the club 20 years ago.

He got fired 48 hours after the arrival to Sochaux of two Peugeot managers. Not a coincidence. Between the company and the club, the relationship is close. To the point that some still call it ""FC Peugeot"".

Like most of the people here, the players drive -officially- all in Peugeot. The day Pedretti (a former player) arrived in a Megane, the berlin of the always enemy Renault, he was asked to park it elsewhere.

Jean-Pierre Peugeot founded FCSM (FC Sochaux-Montbeliard) in 1928 to give entertainment to the workers on Sundays, after church or temple, and to promote the colours of his brand. The club has continued to play its social role in the region.

Jean-Francois Bonnet, a former worker of ""La Peuge"" has followed the club for over 40 years. He created the ""factory section"" of the oldest supporter group. To be part of it, one has "" to like the club AND the company. Have the Peugeot DNA""

&gt; "" I spent 43 years in the factory. When someone speaks of Peugeot, he speaks of Sochaux. But the mentalities have have changed in the company. Same as in the football world. I still feel close to the club, but its no more as I would want it to be.

&gt; Certain players like Perquis or Richert still have our values, but mentalities have changed and this is not just the case for Sochaux. It is the team I love, my region, Its part of the heritage of the region, like the Montbeliard castle.""

Thanks to Peugeot and the FCSM, Sochaux (Doubs)- 4,200 citizens, has the biggest factory in France and the record of seasons in the top flight (63).

But trouble times await the two regional prides. Attendance in the Bonal Stadium has been declining since 2008. The sales of Peugots cars have not stopped declining and the Peugeot family had to sell off part of the company to General Motors.


The Peugeot company hired, at the end of the 30's, close to 50,000 workers. Last year, it was under 12,000 and it has not stopped falling.

The car industry here is the livelyhood for almost everyone. Except when there is forced unemployment (I dont know the English translation of this. Its when your owners tell you not to come to work as there is no work to do. You only earn a part of your normal salary asweel), like last week. ""Minmin"" has to work from one car supplier to the other on part time and support FC Sochaux. Two reasons to not be in a good mood.

&gt; ""This year, it is not very joyful in regards to work. It is not joyful in regards to everything actually.""

Peugeot still owns the club. The link between the two is Alexandre Lacombe. A worker who became director of the sales of Peugeots, today he is the representative president of the club. At his arrival in 2008, he laid down his vision.

&gt; "" I will try as representative president of FCSM to bring my managerial methods that brought success in my previous job""

In Montbellierd, which was raised ""like a baby"" by the paternalism of Peugeot, the guide book of the perfect manager is not top in the sales. In less than four years, Lacombe was able to get almost everyone against him despite a 5th place in the league last year. Alot of major players left the club, aswell as the coach Francis Gillot last year.

Lacombe is criticized for his ""money pinching"" style. He refused to renew contracts of certain players and to replace those that were sold for good money. And for his knowledge of football, some journalists claimed that when asked about the 4-3-3, the president answered them

&gt; ""I don't know this car model""

For Daniel, 73 years old, the club does not make itself appealing and Lacombe is part of the reason. The stats point to this direction aswell. Since 2008, attendance at the Bonal Stadium has dropped every year.

"" People are let down because of the bad results but also because of the bad mood around the club. I think the club is finished. But I hope I'm wrong, for the sake of my region.""

The most dissapointed are the Joyriders, the ""ultras"" of Sochaux. The club has adopted a very strict policy in regards to banners and flares. The ultras say the club is refusing to dialogue, while the Presdient Lacombe says the opposite. Fabrice Beltrambini, vice-president of the group explains-


""Lacombe governs the club like a company, without any human relations. If we are still here, its so the club can find again its family values. With Plessis (the former president), we sometimes insluted each other, but atleast we spoke. 

Jean-Claude Plessis ran the club from 1999-2007. He is bitter, and calls against the big economies the clubs has had to do and the change in spirit.

""Nothing is left of the club. Before it was more friendly, journalists would eat with us after games. Now, all this has ended, theres nothing left. But Ive already said too much of it and it creates problems.""

Its true. On RTL (French Radio station), two days earlier, he decyphered Lacombe.

""I went to Sochaux last weeke-end, I saw the bottom of the club, a club that didn't exist. The workers at the club all feel down. The players hate the owners. We have a president who is an imposter, who has nothing to do in football, he doesn't like football, doesn't like football players, he doesn't like people simply"".

In regards to communication, the words of Plessis has lead to other criticism being said. A local journalist said with nostalgia

"" With Plessis, we had barbecues the nights of games. With Lacombe, we need to send 5 faxes to meet up.""

The players, them, would rather prefer ""pizza parties"" says a supporter who workds part time at Domino's. They also like going to the kebab of Montbeliard, where insults were traded between Marvin Martin, the (former) star of the club and a few supporrters. Others have skipped training to be able to leave the club. If Sochaux is a family club, then its children are much more rascals than before. Enzo continues

&gt; ""Most of the players do whatever they want here. The act like smart asses, but they are fucking up their own carears.""

For the president of the Joyriders, Benjamin Barrault, this behaviour could move on to other clubs

&gt;"" At ""la Peuge"", the lads earn 1,200 euros a month maximum, and the players they win 40,000. This difference has been present for a while, but the players have to give their maximum for the guys paying their stadium memberships. So the players who arrive late to training, we remember their names. Because the worker, when he starts at midnight, if he arrives at 00:01 he suffers the consequences.""

The rapper KLX raps in a song: ""Here, people are working in factories right next to us, so we dont like it when the players dont ""sweat"" for the club/ We accept defeat, but not dishonner.""

""Minmin, who wraps up 400-600 car bumpers a day in bubbly paper, also worked on car doors and pedals. He multiplies ""1 week job contracts"" because it ""allows him to get money during forced unemployment"". On weekends, he supports Sochaux. Basically, he lives Peugeot but the mother company, he is fed up with it.  ""All for profit"", he complaines.

&gt; ""Before, people lived for Peugeot. But if people are less attached to Peugeot, its their fault: now, they are laying them off.""

If the club falls down to Ligue 2, Benjamin is not sure if he will still go to the stadium.

&gt;"" Ligue 2 now, its on Fridays and Mondays. Those nights, Im working. Labourers, have to work and dont have the chance to get rest days. So thats why, for us, relegation is deatch. What will we do of our weekends?""

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; If the ""GIIPS"" have their own currency, they can devaluate it. That's the traditional way to adjust for competitive gradient. A way that is not available to ""the South"" because countries like Germany are also aboard and don't want that

True, and they need it. However, it has never forced them to do reforms before, they just kept devaluating. What is different now? They would also have enormous interest rates and inflation, a whole new set of problems. 

&gt;For the sake of the argument, let us assume ""the South"" fixes it's problems and actually becomes more competitive than Germany. Now what. Competitiveness differences are always going to drive a thrust through a single currency. Personally, I am ok with giving away a few percents of individual income (not of GDP, that's prolly more) a year to keep Europe going. I feel that it's worth it. When it comes to a dozen percents, maybe not though...

Well, Greece, southern Italy and Spain has been on the receiving end since forever, 80's at least or 60's for some of them. What has happened with the billions they have receive?  You seem to assume that they would be like the DDR, or the Estonians, immediately trying to become competitive after years of hardship. You forget that they have had the chance, for decades, to become as competitive, but not taken it (maybe Spain/Portugal a bit). It is something built into the system. Even now, with the backs against the wall, Italy refuse necessary reforms, and Greece haven't even implemented half of the stuff from *the first bailout*. It doesn't work that you give them some money and they become competitive. If that were the case, it would have happend. Instead, you take them on to support them for the forseeable future. 

Even with countries that does want to change- take DDR as an example. BRD has pumped *trillions* into it, and it is still not as competitive as BRD, 23 years after the fact. And, they still receive over €100 billions/year (I looked it up :-) 

So, what you will take on is giving money to the south, for at least 30-40 years, probably forever, since the culture. And, it will be double digit of your GDP, no doubts. DDR/BRD, ratio was 20 million/60 million. South/north is 145/180, and that is if France take full responsibility, but they are in trouble as well. 

So sending 25 % of your GDP south for the next 50 years? How does that sound?

&gt;why not have the transfers. Yes, that is going to be extremely unpopular. But I feel the alternative is the breakup of the Euro, something Germany can not afford. You are correct in your analysis btw, as far as I can tell. 

Can you afford supporting southern Europe forever?. Breaking up the Euro is expensive, but then you are out and can control your destiny. Supporting the south for forever is a slow, and very expensive death. In the end, sending double digits of GDP south will always be more expensive. 

&gt;And I really hope the Euro will be saved. There is idealistic motivations for this, from somebody who just wants everybody to get along. And there is economic motivations. I think the importance of the Euro to an economy which exports a lot into the Eurozone can not be underestimated. We can pour a lot of money into this thing and still come out in the black. Which may be part of the problem :)

I understand that you want to save the Euro, but which Euro? The Euro that is in yours, and other idealistic peoples head (not that it is anything wrong with dreams) or the real Euro? 

Why do you want a Euro, where a treaty is not more worth than toilet paper? How can you built upon that? 

Don't you agree that everyone has to follow the treaty? Or, write a new one.

So, if you want to save it, you should have answers to how to start following the treaty or write a new one. Hint - none of the two can happen in the next decade, at least.  Do you think the EZ can ignore treaties forever? We need to vote, and then I can guarantee it will be a sound no to sending more money south. And, the alternative is not letting us vote. That is not a true alternative either. 

If you truly believe in the Euro, you need to have a democratic Euro, where one follows the law. That actually rules this one out, doesn't it? 

Also, the advantages of the Euro seems to be overestimated. Finland did a bit better than Sweden, the first 5 years. However, it has been doing worse since 2008, and they have to borrow more. Don't think the Finns don't know this. Of course, economics it is not like math (several different reasons), but it is becoming harder and harder for the Finns to defend the Euro because of its advantages. There is a reason that the True Finns, who wants to quit the Euro are the 3rd biggest party 820 %). Also, for the future - you can never ever get the Finns to pay 25 % of their GDP for the next 40 years, not while the Swedes and Danes sits there laughing, counting our Kronor. 

Which brings me really to the most important point, something that everyone seems to have lost sight off. A currency union is supposed to be beneficial, to bring advantages. I don't think the Euro, in its current form is bringing any advantages for anyone. Short run, the north, but in the long run you will loose to. Countries are supposed to want to be in ones, not fight to stay out (Sweden, Poland etc). 

The Euro isn't anything a good currency union should be. It lacks the integration and the transfer mechanism, the bank union, the debt pooling. And, it doesn't care about any law, rules and regulations. No wonder it is failing. 


&gt;As in ""interesting times""?

Yes, exactly, 

I believe a small Euro, between similar countries might work (Germany, Austria Finland for example) and one has to follow the treaty or re-write it. This Euro simply doesn't work in its current form. Maybe we can try again in 50 years.... 


PS. I like you too, it is fun exchanging ideas. I am just more pessimistic/realistic, and don't really believe in the Euro. The problem is, the Euro is making it very easy for me to attack it..

In particular:
 - what would citizen army do against fuel-air bombs dropped from planes flying at over 10 km altitude? No portable AA missile system can hit targets so high, AA guns are also basically useless against such targets. Cities and infrastructure can be destroyed very easily and cost-effectively with such bombs. How long would citizen milita fight without fuel, electricity, communication (powerplants, supply chain and communication infrastructure were destroyed in the first attack). When the whole country is ruined and every remaining road is full of people escaping burning cities?

What would citizen militia do against long range artillery? Cell phones won't work, enemy controls air and has many drones to give targets to the artillery. All you see is every 5 seconds something explodes nearby. Enemy can be anywhere in 60 km radius. What would citizen army do against that?

Notice, that USA were created when warfare was very different, and now USA have huge standing army. Switzerland is in mountains, in the middle of now-peaceful Europe. Vietnam is in jungle and communists helped them. Afghanistan is desert+mountains, and it was conquered easily last time.

Even if it's costly to keep army there, by the time Europe will be conquered we already lost. The point isn't to make the invader eventually go away. That's easy - wait 200 years and almost every country will die by itself from one reason or another and then you are free and can start over again. Poles tried that many times and it works - you just need to keep your culture and be patient. Do you want EU to bet on that?

The point of army is to keep others from destroying your country. You don't need to occupy country for long to destroy it.

Europe is mostly nice flat hills or valleys, good roads, nowhere to hide. Blitzkrieg works great in Europe.

Like that everyone could devote themselves to something and we will progress. Our society(I mean all of humanity) isn't ready for that yet.

On the other hand-yes foreign people work for less. True. But. I want every single one of you to think. When I see ""Made in China"" I think ""This is shit"". Plus what does it matter if you have a strong economy but your people are poor? I mean the goal of economy is to make people rich. That why it was made. I'd rather pay a little more for an European product that is nice over some shitty Asian(Except Japan. They are like us)/ African product. 

What I'm trying to say is-we don't need to compete. Our goal is to live well. I don't give a fuck if China makes more products as long as everyone in Europe lives well and is rich.

Other continents will never be the same as Europe. Throughout history Europe has been the light in the dark. Every important science thing is made either in Europe or North America. It's a fact. Even if Africans work a lot the next breakthrough will be in Europe. It's bound to be and it always has been. There is a reason European countries ruled the whole world and are the richest now. We don't have to fit in with them. They have to look up to us and pay to their workers, not make them live in misery.

Agreed. It wasn't really encouraged, but no prosecutor ever prosecuted war crimes on our side, so it was more or less allowed. Highest ranking officials knew what was happening and they kept silent.

So .... I do thin Tuđman should have faced war crime charges. Šušak even more, Šeks, Glavaš, Merčep .... Norac .... 

&gt;While I understand that such things always happened and still do (look at Syria) this is actually one of the things that needs to change. People doing such things need to be punished instead of being celebrated as war heroes.

When you have bishops claiming you can't do war crimes in a defensive war there is a lot that needs to change.

maybe if we could just let others do what they want and stop shoving religion / ideology onto other people. I really don't want some religious idiot deciding what I can and can't do .... or an ideologue.

If you take a closer look, religion and communism were the same thing, even their hierarchy and dogma were mostly copy-paste. It all boils down to controlling the people with fairy tales while living on their expanse.

I'm fairly certain that you have never studied Finnish history.

&gt; The cost/benefit analysis of invading a nation with an entire populace that is ready to pick up a gun leans pretty heavy in the cost direction.

Like the Soviet Union invading Finland in 1939.

&gt; The only purpose of a standing army is to invade other nations and project military presence.

The purpose of standing army is to be able to react quickly against an sudden or quick enemy threat, being able to take the first strike and allow the rest of armed forces to be mobilized. This is even more important with conscription army that needs even more time to be mobilized into a full readiness. Not to mention that some elements of armies need professionals, you have to have a professional air force, you need to have professional leadership and instructors to guide them.

&gt; EDIT: Also, the other role of the standing army is to oppress the people/defend the ruling class. Of course coups can happen and the military itself becomes the ruling class.

Here in the U.S., we take it for granted that we are now in a globalized economy. There is no going back. We're not going to compete with Asia for low-wage, low-end manufacturing. In fact, we're going to push for freer trade with many parts of the world - including the EU - which will permit cheaper products in our country and greater economies of scope. 

How do advanced economies grow? By concentrating on high-value products and services. High technology, software, advanced manufacturing, R&amp;D, plus non-outsource-able services.

No. Turkey's army is necessary for the north to continue as a state, as is Turkey's economy. The north half of the island is clearly occupied territory, I'd even say it's sort of like a colony since people keep moving there. 

Turkey supports unification only if the terms are in their favor. Of course that means the terms will probably be unfair to the southern part, and internationally the south is the part that matters. (I've seen you posting nationalistic shit about Turkey around here, OP, please cut it out.)

Donc pour placer les deux 1 sur la première ligne, on peut faire 1 1 . , 1 . 1, et . 1 1, ce qui donne 1 1 1, 1 2 1, et 1 1 1, la solution du milieu étant donc la meilleure.

If Chinese workers were allowed to come to EU or UK and enjoy a level of wages similar to people working there, it would be much harder to hire workers in Chinese factories. The wages there would rise much faster than it currently does (even if it seem very fast from a European point of view, when you consider the imbalance betweent the economical zones, it is fairly slow)

Alternatively, if UK and EU workers were allowed to come and work in China, they could easily dodge the unemployement that is not caused by automation.

Within a few years, China and EU would have the same level of unemployement and wages. Can you imagine a world where wages would equilibrate at the same speed than the real tax rates that multinational companies actually pay?

He said so himself by stating that FYROM was named ""Macedonia"" as a provacation to Greece during a time of great hostilities in the Balkans. In genetic studies FYROM'ians are basically a 100% match with Bulgarians since they ARE Bulgarians . . . 

For example the genetic match between Bulgaria/FYROM is closer than the genetic match between Crete and a place like Rhodes or Thessaloniki.

The northern part of Greece has been called Macedonia since before Alexander the Great was alive and it will always be the true Macedonia. By having this imposter nation on there border it is attack on there identity and culture . . and greeks are very passionate about these things.

It also does not help FYROM when there president/prime minister is seen with pictures of FYROM'ian map with its border extended down to cover Northern greek territory.

Most new parties want to be seen as genuine grass roots movements. But to stand a chance of taking on the big parties, small donations are probably not going to be enough. Everyone would like to do a Barack Obama, who raised millions in small donations for his US Presidential campaign but, in reality, you are probably going to need find some wealthy backers.

There's usually more metal out in [Badalona](https://www.facebook.com/estraperloclubdelritme) and the metro 

Hit up [MACBA](http://www.macba.cat/es/) for skaters chilling, contemporary art and the art/psych universities. Negroni is a great G&amp;T bar nearby on C/ Joaquin Costa along with the Betty Ford bar and a bunch others.

The Gracia neighbourhood is a bit more hippy/hipster than downtown and very chill and funky (w/o being pretentious IMO).

Are the factual assertions true and do the other inferences make sense?  

Parts of Europe don't have a good track record, that's true, but is there a real danger there?  Massacres like Serebnica requires a war-like environment.  Events like the Holocaust require insanity imposed through totalitarian control and a multi-year _process_ building up to genocide.  The Inquisition is outmoded anyway.  So I find this exaggerated.  

Can it be discounted completely?  Perhaps not.  Is it significant that a Turkish president would talk about 'the continent of Europe' as a whole, as if it were a unified entity?

true,panda86trueno,MACE,Macedonia,"I would like to make two points with this discussion topic. First, on the issue of genetic matches between the regions, it is important to remember that this ENTIRE region, including Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, Serbia, and parts of Greece, were under control of the Ottoman Empire for over 500 years, which during that time, mass migrations were prevalent throughout the region. Going back even further, this region was dominated by Slavs from the north, around the 7th Century or so. While the ANCIENT region of Macedonia did encompass a majority of the region, however, that territory as a whole, no longer exists (and, understandably, will most likely not exist again). 

We can listen all day to people on both sides fueling arguments for both sides of this debate, and unfortunately its an argument that I hear very frequently where I live.

Which brings me to my second point, it seems this issue is completely propagated by both sides of the issue to cover up their own domestic problems. We have a relatively inefficient government, which would rather flaunt nationalistic displays instead of investing for their people. And Greece has numerous economic problems, and a Mussolini-esque rise in fascist ideology within their government. The name issue, much like the flag issue, just serves as a deterrent to make any progress on normalized relations, trade, and economic progress for either state. 

I have the fortunate pleasure to work with many Macedonians everyday, as well as Greek partners on various cross border projects, and in general (although not always), people on both sides of the border are just the same, kind, generous, and amazing people. The issue at hand here is simply two relatively inefficient governments trying to harness job security by rallying around the most divisive force, nationalism.

Overall, borders change, time moves on, and its trivial to assume a name would lead to the automatic secession or invasion of another region. More important issues should be at the forefront of the development, shame on both governments for stooping so low.

Keynes evidently had little growth theory to draw on: he talks in monetary terms of the wonders of compound interest. Investments simply grow at around 2 percent a year – ask not why. Technology improves, for an improvement in “technical efficiency” of 1 percent a year. Making generous room for more of the “disastrous mistakes” that had brought forth the depression, he predicted that living standards would “in the progressive countries” be four to eight times higher a century on. There would be a phase of “technological unemployment” as labor productivity outpaced the finding of new uses for labor, but ultimately we would work out how to spread the dividends so that everyone worked an average of three hours a day.

The link has been setup to find a 850€ rent, in Paris, between 30 and 35m^2. You can of course modify all these things. 

You also have the coed solution, you live with other people, which can be a pain (or a great experience, i did it myself a few years ago and it was nice), BUT, a friend of mine is doing this (he is the owner) and backup demands are much lighter or even sometimes inexistant. It can be a better solution too if it's for a short time period, i'll ask him about the website he's used to go to tomorrow and will link it here if you're interested. Another good point of this method is that you usually pay cheaper than a 'normal' rent (because you're paying for the room, not the whole thing), but live in a bigger apartment, that might be what you're looking for.

After a while, they become the worst places to be at, because at that point, all that 'beauty' begins to fade and all you see are overpriced souvenir shops and illegal Muslims trying to sell you stuff. Best places to see (in my humble, insignificant opinion) are Spanish Pyrenees mountains around the area of Pamplona, Alps (Switzerland/Austria/Bavaria), and Western Scandinavia (Norwegian fjords and Denmark). Google some of the pictures of these areas... amazing stuff. I once took a tour starting in Munich, then went to Prague for two days, then Vienna for 2 days, then Salzburg, then Zurich, Bern, Geneva, and then back to Munich for my flight back. Best trip ever. All you need for trips like these are your wallets (with a shitload of cash), some water bottles, a map, and some phrase books of the local languages. Seriously, don't carry bags full of crap that weighs you down (Did that once on my trip to Scandinavia. Big mistake). Travel light, travel quickly. The more you see in a certain amount of time, the better (in my opinion). But make sure you feel your pocket every now and then, pickpockets are a serious problem in Europe. If you lose your wallet, you're in trouble. Make sure you carry your passports on you at all times, in case you ever need to go to the US consulates for emergencies or whatever. Make sure to have a few debit cards with some money on it so that you could just walk up to any ATM and withdraw however much of any currency you need. It's the easiest way. Try to carry your cash and debit cards in separate pockets. If you lose one, you won't be completely screwed. Try to find food and shelter outside the city centers, much cheaper. If you have student ID's from college or whatever (even if they're expired), bring them with you, show them wherever you can; you can get some solid student discounts from that. If you want to see some exciting/awesome-fun-all-day-not-remember-last-night cities, I obviously suggest the the tourist hubs, like Paris, Amsterdam, some parts of Berlin, Prague, Barcelona, etc. If you want to actually have a great time, I suggest, Munich/Bavaria, Switzerland, Scandinavia, Spanish countryside, Poland, and essentially just about any place that's not featured on the travel channel. I strongly recommend Switzerland. By far the most beautiful country on Earth. If you go there and you see people walking around with STG90 Assault Rifles in the street, don't be shocked, its normal in Switzerland, just the local militia following millenia-old traditions.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Its not like the Finnish people are not heavily armed and essentially all men are in what is basically a militia. 

In 1939 that was more of the case, many owned riffles and practiced with them. Even today Finland is ranked 4th on number of guns per capita.

&gt; Did you know that militias regularly train and maintain readiness? Apparently not. 

And you don't know what we for example in here would be up against. Lets say that in Russia an evil Putin would get into power and hypnotize all Russians to support him to bring the USSR back and get some lands back that belonged to imperial Russia.

The new Soviet invasion would begin suddenly with a massive strategic strike against Helsinki, the capital city, followed by mechanized infantry crossing the border at the same time...

* In the first 30 minutes of war, Soviet air forces would strike with hundreds of fighters and cruise missiles against critical infrastructure and leadership, in the aim of shutting down supply of electricity, communications and leadership functions. 
* In the next 120 minutes of war, Finnish air forces would mobilize themselves and try to take back the Finnish air space in southern Finland and over the capital region. In the same Soviet amphibious and paratrooper units would have landed to Helsinki taking over key locations, ministries and incapacitated/eliminated leadership.
* In the next 24 hours Finnish standing army with mostly the help of conscripts in training would strike against the enemy in the capital via underground massive tunnel network, trying to take out occupying units and forming the initial ring around Helsinki to take back the capital. In the same in eastern border, Finnish units would be busy destroying every bridge they can to slow down Soviet mechanized infantry.
* In the next few days, depending on how bad the situation, the army would start to supply weapons and other supplies to conscripts around the country, either in orderly fashion or in sheer chaos.
* During the new two weeks, Helsinki would turn into a hell on earth, street battles and air forces would level down most of the city, in the eastern Finland there would be big battles against the invading force.

The thing with militias is that they are no match against a professional army and they certainly can't be mobilized in very short time. Like I said, the war would start with a strategic strike against the leadership and it would be the deciding factor on can the Finnish forces mount an effective defense.",0,1365833952,null,0,false,0,c9ea5b2,t3_1c6p81,t1_c9ea5b2,t1_c9e0bwy,null,1431573474,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I highly recommend Budapest/Prague/Berlin for part of your journey. The three cities are easily accessible by train, affordable, historic, and a great time. Southern Spain is also beautiful, affordable, and fun, but it's super hot in the summer.

Ways to save money: eat breakfast at the hostel and go to local grocery stores for snacks, sandwiches, etc. instead of eating out all the time. Check out hotel prices in certain places, because sometimes a room for three is cheaper than three separate beds in a hostel. Consider Couchsurfing, as well. Lots of museums/sightseeing attractions have free days of the week, so check that out. Also, bring your student IDs! Loads of things in Europe are way cheaper for students/youth under 25 or 26.

You definitely need to get started on obtaining the necessary visa as soon as possible. Also, as already mentioned, finding housing in Frankfurt isn't exactly easy, so start looking right now. Your student ID will give you free and unlimited access to the entire RMV transportation network (S-Bahn, U-Bahn and Trams) so don't worry about finding something that is directly next to the university.

I am assuming that your program will be in English. But if you plan on staying in Germany after you graduate then you absolutely MUST starting working towards being proficient in German now. There are people who say that you can find a good job in Germany without speaking German - but don't listen to these people. There are good jobs available for people who don't speak German, but not very many.

I am not sure how your program will be set up, but you will probably need to do some sort of Praktikum (Internship). The university will provide assistance with this, but not very much at all. Start looking for one now. Contact companies in the area that are in your field. Let them know that you will be studying in Frankfurt and when you will be available and for how long. Just start looking for possible contacts now - I cannot stress this enough. Take advantage of the many optional seminars and lectures that are offered at Goethe and show the professors your interest in the topics as this can also expose you to some opportunities.

true,banana-tree,TURK,Turkey,"Instead of using an obviously false statistic and a blatant lie, you can look at budget distributions if you want a relatively meaningful indicator of government policy. One could point out the fact that one of the largest chunks of the budget of this supposedly secular government goes to the [Presidency (not Ministry) of Religious Affairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Religious_Affairs) (4.5 billion lira). This is more than what 11 ministries each get including Ministries of Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Science&amp;Technology, Tourism, Health, and Environment. There are other ministries that exceed the budget for Religious Affairs though, like Ministries of National Defense, Family&amp;Social Policy, Labour&amp;Social Security, Finance, Transport&amp;Communication, Forest&amp;Water Management... oh and Education, almost forgot that. The latter gets 68.1 billion lira, if you're interested in comparing numbers.

I hate having to defend these guys but the obviously ignorant criticism really isn't helping anyone at all and only serves to make you look bad. The fact that you can actually believe that a government could get away with building 0 schools in a country with a constant population increase (which the PM encourages) is despicable in an of itself.

I'm using all keyword combinations I can think of and failing to find the original source of that information. On top of that, the only document I could find that has any data about this says 3807 schools were built in 4 years (couldn't find a 10-year statistic)**. There is also further news that say the number of girls that don't attend school have dropped from 873,000 to 56,000 since AKP came to power. On the other hand, the number of new mosques in 10 years is said to be around 7,500 in many sources, not 17,000.

I can rant forever about AKP's policies on education and religion, but not with false information.

Of course this has an effect, but don't forget [price elasticity of demand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand). Some people just want a BMW, others will go with a Lexus when the BMW's relative price increases by 10%. But when your company has specific requirements that only one machine or part properly fulfills, this relatively higher price will just mean that they'll have to charge more for the products they produce with it.

- We have to be a world of landowners. Actually, once building construction gets automated, rents will be much lower too but to get to zero, you would need some law. We can debate whether it is desirable or not, but in such a world, paying a rent to a landowner serves no desirable economic outcome, and a society without this possibility would be totally workable.

don't mention the 'Eastern European' connection.

Now several things might be happening here. Perhaps the gangs aren't comprised of more Eastern Europeans than before. Perhaps they are but that fact is immaterial. Perhaps they are, the fact's immaterial, and mentioning it would be socially divisive and antagonistic.


Here's what I think: the BBC, The Guardian and Salon have deliberately omitted the 'Eastern European' factor because it suits their political &amp; social beliefs not to mention it. I also think that deliberately editing possibly salient facts out of news reporting because they're uncomfortable to one's prejudices actually panders to the far right racists. If they can point to what they can plausibly describe as deliberate censorship they'll find their venom easier to sell.

So perhaps better save your attacks for the nannyish liberal media that obviously believes *pas devant les enfants* is a founding principle of journalism.

Essentially the problem with renewable energy is that its output can vary greatly. In some cases the output is too small and other power sources, for example gas powered generators have to kick in. In other cases there is so much excesses amount of energy in the network that driving down other generators doesn't help, in these cases that electricity needs to be dumped somewhere, as if it is not, then you will have major problems when the excesses power starts to wreck havoc in your network.

This is a major problem with renewable energy sources as usually network operators can't charge them for the costs associated on re-enforcing the network to handle much bigger outputs not to mention costs associated with building and operating backup generation capacity.

By the way, in Finland industry pays 0.75 EUR per kWh while in Portugal industry needs to pay 0.101 and 0.124 in Germany.

Do some sightseeing and visit some of the tourist hotspots when you're near them, just don't simply tick off every page in your tourist guide without seeing how normal people live.

I see where you're coming from. But many of those tourist hotspots are popular for a reason, so don't just dismiss them out of a hipsteresque sense of false individualism. Sure, it would be nicer without getting herded through them among busloads of guided tours, but some of those places truly are unique in this world and standing e.g., in an old Roman bath house and imagining how the scene must have been two thousand years ago just does something to you.

And hey, why not take a bus tour of the city when you're hung over from last night and don't feel like walking around all day? Sounds tacky, but it will put the city's history into perspective and it will connect some dots between sights and events that will help you to better understand why the city today is the way it is. The guide might explain how it was settled around a Roman fort and how you can still see where it used to be by the city's structure. Many streets in city centers have been right where they are today since the very beginning.

Or even of the people in Greece if they would object it.

North Macedonia kind of makes sense, but calling Skopja just ""Macedonia"" is historically (and also geographically, 80% of Macedonia the region is in Greece and Bulgaria, not to mention that the geographical naming has even less relevance than one that has to do with history/culture/nationalities etc.) inaccurate and retarded. 

Those people, half of them look like they are Putin's nephew, and they go on parading about how they are the descendants of Alexander the Great (a clearly mediteranean civilization). Or that Justinian was a ""Macedonian"" because he was born around that area. The hell?

What they are saying makes zero sense, say linguistic reviews concluded that Macedonians were speaking a variation of Greek for 500 years before they joined the rest of Greece, which means they were Greek, which means if Skopjans are somehow related to the ancient Macedonians they would also be of greek descent, but no, that isn't enough to satisfy Skopjan nationalism and their ethnogenesis efforts, so they claim something that violates occam's razor in 3 billion ways, wtf man, like macedonians were speaking greek, but they were not greek, but then they mixed with greece, but they really didn't, and then Justinian was a Macedonian, and the fact that the whole history and culture of their region was slavic doesn't matter, and now current greeks are not greeks or something, like what the fuck are they talking about? I don't give a shit about nationalism but what they are saying insults common sense.

When they call themselves ""Macedonia"" it's not just ""le silly balkan naming dispute omg so backwater #WHOCARES"", it's not them fighting nationalists, it's like them claiming that ""everything you read in your country's history books is wrong"" Would you fucking not take offense to that? You are not going to tell me what's wrong while you spout bullshit and all that because you are scared that half your population might one day want a unification with Bulgaria.

Most European nations don't have to pay any significant amount of money on defence due to the USA stepping in and paying for it all under a NATO banner.

So I opt for maintaining the status quo as long as possible. However, I do think that the USA will eventually get tired of protecting Europe when the the USA has other interests such as East Asia and the benefits of the US protection of Europe look slimmer and slimmer, at which point the USA will problem withdraw from NATO or at least it's huge resources from the European bit of NATO.

Everyone had meat and pure products, natural. Nobody starved. Now there are people who starve. We ate yogurt from sheep which people can't afford now. Bulgaria exported huge amounts of electricity.

You can't claim there is some sort of national identity without then explaining what it is. It's probably different for, say, Gibraltar because of its size and population but for a country like the UK I don't think it even has one. Infact, if it does have one and a few million immigrants can somehow ""erode"" it I'd say it was so superficial its disappearance would be no great loss.

&gt;unmitigated and unlimited immigration

I don't see how that comes into Multiculturalism. Granted any opposition to immigration is usually followed by accusations of racism, and the people making the accusations tend to call upon 'multiculturalism' for support. But the issue is more how to ""integrate"" immigrants once they are in the country than it is how many immigrants we should allow in.

I also think it's very unhelpful for social cohesion when 2nd or even 3rd generation immigrants are still thought of as ""immigrants"" the same as ones arrived in the last few years. 

&gt; societal unrest 

I don't think the response to this should be abandoning multiculturalism. It should be listening to the disaffected groups and finding out what's creating this unrest. Going the other way will only increase tensions.

There would be no way of even determining if someone is integrated or not. Also ""integrate or leave""? What we're seeing today (in the UK) is children or grandchildren of immigrants ""turning back to their roots"" - they're British citizens and they can't (and shouldn't) be deported.

&gt;For instance, in the UK, local councils print most of their literature in a very wide variety of languages so that all the 80 year old Bangladeshi ladies who moved here 40 years ago and never bothered to learn English can still function.

I tend to agree with you but I think instead of just cutting them off completely more of an effort should be made to teach English and make the resources readily available. Some people wouldn't take this up but they'll be in the minority. (As a side note: if the council has people that don't speak English it has an obligation to make available whatever is needed in a language they can understand.)

&gt;Transgressions of norms based on culture. Recent case where a young man pleaded innocence in a case where he'd raped a lass on the basis that because of his religion he was unaware of what sex was and didn't know what he was doing.

O.K., you've obviously taken an extreme example that no one in their right mind would support. The only way this would make it an example of the country being ""too forgiving"" is if the judge actually let him off because of his culture - which I don't think would be very likely.

Admittedly you have to be better off than some, but if I recall correctly it's €10k deposit to open a non-dom offshore account with HSBC in Jersey, other investment banks probably lower, and most people at some point in their lives will have that sort of money, even if it does seem a long way off.  If you pay life insurance, home and contents insurance, travel insurance, then you should also be familiar with the concept of putting some of your savings into a different currency, bank, country and system as 'insurance'.  It doesn't make you greedy or powerful, it means you're prudent.

If you like the idea of people and countries working and trading with each other, and mass communication and travel you are going to get regular people earning in two currencies and coming under two tax codes.

Even if it doesn't blow up in the way you imagine, it can blow up in other ways.  Something can be learned from the [Ottoman Millet system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_%28Ottoman_Empire%29) perhaps.  It worked OK, until it didn't, and then failed miserably and horribly.  Groups sharing the same geography but hadn't intermarried and had been subject to different societal hierarchies that also took on different tasks in the division of labor ended up not being able to live together at all.  

I understand not wanting to aggressively push or force people to integrate, but I don't understand the advocacy of muticulturalism as anything but a stop-gap measure.  

Since the Turkish president brought up the Holocaust, I'll point out that in the long build-up to the final solution, they de-integrated the Jews, they made sure Jews stood out by what they were forced to wear, they made sure Jews didn't intermarry, they made sure folks thought they were intrinsically different etc.  Amazingly, some of these things are now encouraged to happen w/o force -- not out of expressions of individual preference but as expressions of some kind of group identity.

Sorry for being aggressive. These sort of arguments (especially the ""national identity"" one) just really annoy me. The language of your first post (""fight back"" ""push"") made me assume you agreed with it.

I'm not trying to belittle any country. I just assumed Gibraltar wouldn't have the sort of *regional* diversity that the UK or other similar sized countries would, and would be more unified in the sense a community is unified. But I don't know, does it have a national identity and is immigration affecting it? The UK doesn't.

&gt;In one breath you say we should work in integration and in the next say we can't abandon multiculturalism, as if the two are wholly compatible.

I gave integrate quotation marks because I'm quite skeptical of it personally. Obviously there's needs to be some form of integration in, say, political culture for instance to find a common language and create national unity. But I think regional diversity and diversity among different immigration groups can be compatible with a sense of national unity: just look at the US. The two can quite happily coexist.

It's just that Holland is about five to ten years behind Spain on the trajectory.  

Now, if you actually stop and think about it.   

If you look at what the data tells us and bear in mind that both countries are in a malign currency union and think about where Holland's going to be in about 5 years with a 4% budget deficit.

And consider that Dutch unemployment has nearly doubled in the last five years. 

And then give it another five years and consider that in the last five years Spain has gone from fine to sick.

Holland is set to be about as fucked as Spain in five to ten years.

true,Calpa,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt;It's just that Holland is about five to ten years behind Spain on the trajectory. 

That hugely depends on what kind of economy you have.. The Dutch have a huge export economy due to them having one of the largest ports in the world; this pretty much allows them to act as a transport hub for not only their own industry, but also Germany's. 

You cannot just compare two countries whithout looking what actually makes up those economies - they differ greatly. 

Compare this:

&gt;The Netherlands has a prosperous and open economy, which depends heavily on foreign trade. The economy is noted for stable industrial relations, fairly low unemployment and inflation, a sizable current account surplus, and an important role as a European transportation hub. Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly mechanised agricultural sector employs no more than 2% of the labour force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners, began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002. The country is one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment.

..to the fact that the [rising Spanish economy was largely due to the property bubble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Spain). 

The Dutch economy relies mostly on industry (24.4%) and services (73.7%), whereas the Spanish economy relies on industry (11.7%), construction (10.0%) and services (66.6%).. the difference in reliance on own industry is important here, and also one must not underestimate the benefit of The Netherlands in neighbouring Germany - as long as they're still up on their feet, the Dutch will do fine.

It's a political question now more than discriminatory. I could cite many reasons deniers cite here from semantics to content, but you'll have to excuse me for not playing the devil's advocate for this for the third time this month. Let's just stick to the subject of active discrimination towards minorities and immigrants *today*.

&gt;Why on earth have you denied them this for so long.

There were certainly despicable policies towards Kurds and their language in the past, but the government and the official attitude has changed now. Why would you blame the current government and policies for the mistakes of the past that were acknowledged and remedied?

&gt;Do you have a lot of Kurdish ministers, ambassadors etc?

Yes, there are actually more Kurdish-origin MPs by ratio than there are in the population at large. We had a Kurdish president (Turgut Özal) back when PKK was active at its peak with mass civillian killings.

&gt;You do not seem to understand that they have lived in your country forever, but you see them as some foreign part.

Of course I understand this, you are the one who brought the comparison up with immigrants (when Kurds, in reality, aren't so), so I'm just answering your specific questions about which you seem to have a clear misperception.

The issue the government used to take with Kurds wasn't with the Kurdish origin of anyone, it was with increasing demands for a national identity separate from that of a nation state, and the separatist ambitions. Not every Kurd wanted a separate state or refused the Turkish identity, and those became equal and successful parts of the nation state. Allowing Kurds to deal with all official matters in Kurdish would leave no need for them to learn Turkish and 'integrate' to the nation state, increasing the need for a separate state. This is understandably not desirable, but the policies used to enforce this were ridiculous. That has changed now, and further changes are coming up.

&gt;I think you have to specify the minority group and the country

Let's say your pick of a Western European country and demands for education in native language, local governance or change of citizenship definition to not involve the nation in question. So basically asking you not to call a third-generation Turkish immigrant in Germany ""German"" because they don't feel they're German and would like to preserve their national identity. [Or would demands to be educated in all-Turkish schools be tolerated?](http://www.dw.de/merkel-rebuffs-call-for-turkish-schools-in-germany/a-5403967) Isn't asking the same of Turkey a bit hypocritical when you wouldn't have any such thing in your own country?

You either don't understand the slippery slope fallacy, reductio ad absurdum, or both.   

The whole argument that you think it's good that Europe is finding equality by moving the top countries *downwards* is, quite frankly, hysterical, or it would be if it weren't so terrifying that people can think like that.  Small wonder the Eurozone is going to hell in a handbasket if this level of thinking has permeated the ranks of the mandarins.  The other technical term for them is, I believe, 'mouth-breathers'.

true,ReturnOfTheBurn,TEXT,Eingedeutscht,"I can't give you a well informed answer. I have lived here for over 12 years. I had a brief discussion about getting a loan for a house with a bank advisor (EDIT: In a non-bank, non-professional setting). It didn't get to the serious negotiation phase but what I took away from our brief conversation was that it is dependent on a few things if you are a foreigner, and as I explain at the end, especially if you are American.

Do you have gainful full-time employment in Germany?

Do you have considerable savings?

Can a German citizen co-sign for you?

Do you have permanent resident status? (unbefristete aufenthaltserlaubnis)

Do you have family or any other financial obligations in Germany?

If you can answer yes to these, you will probably not be seen as too risky for loan approval. If you answer no to any of them, you can probably still get the loan, but the conditions (interest, etc) will not be so good because you may be seen as a risky loan.

Also, I have heard from some other Americans but can't point to solid sources, some banks don't want to give loans to Americans because there are certain regulations/requirements set forth by the SEC, that the German government has agreed to enforce for the purpose of stopping money laundering and financing of terrorism. These regulations are a bit of a pain in the ass, so unless you want to get a loan for millions, the bank might just say, ""No thanks.""

Por otra parte lo de la lengua es solo una de las razones, no la única. Seguramente todo el mundo está de acuerdo en que las razones económicas pesan incluso más que las linguísticas. Y más razones todavía, tanto objetivas como subjetivas (sentimentales).

Por lo tanto: cuando de forma consistente una región no está de acuerdo con lo que se dictamina desde el estado central, no crees que es planteable una separación? Creo que este debe de ser un debate similar al que se producía en 1981 con la ley del divorcio.

I could cite many reasons deniers cite here from semantics to content, but you'll have to excuse me for not playing the devil's advocate for this for the third time this month. Let's just stick to the subject of active discrimination towards minorities and immigrants today.


Well, I think it is enormously discriminating against the Aremenians *today*, denying them their history, and rights. And, actively fighting against them, asking other countries to deny them too, as evident by the Turkish behaviour when they ask other countries to deny it too. And for the political reasons - it certainly brings Turkey no friends abroad.  I can not believe that a country that claims to pretend about human rights *denies the genocide they have commited*. How on earth can you defend that? It is outrageous.

&gt;There were certainly despicable policies towards Kurds and their language in the past, but the government and the official attitude has changed now. Why would you blame the current government and policies for the mistakes of the past that were acknowledged and remedied?

Honestly, you make it sounds like it is something ancient -  it is in my lifetime,  it is very recent. And, I am sceptic of Turkey  trying to fix their past either- as is evident when it comes to the Armenian genocide that the Turks commited. Also, the politicans, active in Turkey today, have discriminated actively against the Kurds. That does not just change overnight. I have to say though, it does seem that Turkey is making progress with regards to Kurds, and kudos for that. [Here](http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,MARP,,TUR,4562d8b62,469f3add1e,0.html) are links to prove my point - it is not something ancient. [Link](http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/kurds-and-the-turkish-way/), [link](http://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/23/exclusive_us_journalist_deported_from_turkey), [Link 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey).

According to these links, there is still discrimination, organised such. Are you saying there is none? 

So, have public Turkish officials acknowledged, and officially apologized to the Kurds? 

When you say remedied- are you saying that there is no more discrimination? No more economic discrimination at all, every document is in Kurdish, there are Kurdish univiersities, the Turkish state is giving money to end the discrimination etc. Specifiy what you mean with remedied, because I honestly do not think the Turkish state is quite there yet. 

&gt;Yes, there are actually more Kurdish-origin MPs by ratio than there are in the population at large. We had a Kurdish president (Turgut Özal) back when PKK was active at its peak with mass civillian killings.

Kurdish origin is not quite the same really - have all of them always had the oppurtunity to be openly Kurdish? Cool however about the president though, didn't know that. 

&gt;he issue the government used to take with Kurds wasn't with the Kurdish origin of anyone, it was with increasing demands for a national identity separate from that of a nation state, and the separatist ambitions. Not every Kurd wanted a separate state or refused the Turkish identity, and those became equal and successful parts of the nation state. Allowing Kurds to deal with all official matters in Kurdish would leave no need for them to learn Turkish and 'integrate' to the nation state, increasing the need for a separate state. This is understandably not desirable, but the policies used to enforce this were ridiculous. That has changed now, and further changes are coming up.

Other countries, like Finland/Canada/Spain etc manages to deal with this issue. There are no perfect solutions of course, but the Turkish solution have been brutal. Are you still not allowed to insult Attatürk btw or deny Turkey and stuff like that (not that it has anything to do with the Kurds, just interested


&gt;Let's say your pick of a Western European country and demands for education in native language, local governance or change of citizenship definition to not involve the nation in question.

Well, the difference is that the Kurds have been in Turkey for quite a while, haven't they? Are you even sure that you were first? I have no problems with Turkey denying Finns the right to have a Finnish university etc, if the Finns started to move to Turkey *en masse*. However, if there is a Finnish school that follow the Turkish curriculum, do you have a problem with that? 

And, as for your question, I can answer for Sweden. Every student get a certain sum of money, ""attached"" by the government, and they can then go to a private or government school. If the Turks want to start a Turkish school they can do that, and have the education in Turkish. Howver, they have to fulfill the Swedish rules for a school as in teaching certain things, equality, learning Swedish, math, biology etc. If the Turks in Sweden have a problem with the curriculum, they have the same rights as everyone else to try to get the parlament to change it. So, basically, the Turks in Sweden have the same rights as I do. Can you honestly say it is completely the same for in Turkey, for everyone? 

&gt;. I'm just calling you out on your bias.

Which bias? I think Turkey is much more discriminating than we are against minorities, and I think I am right there, don't you? 

I mean, I know Turkey is making progress and I think you should have a lot of kudos for that (kudos!!!!!!!), but it is from a rather dark place, and it is a tad rich of Turkey to call us out on human rights.

You just said,

Yet your first comment said something quite different:

         ""I remember a quantitative analyst saying the same 
          thing... He talked about the ""safety car effect""...I 
          am still waiting and hoping that this will be true.""

That's literally an argument that if the top countries weren't doing so well and racing ahead then there'd be a benefit of more economic equality.   You just said that you hoped that the stronger economies in Europe slow down so the weaker ones can catch up, only the smaller ones aren't growing slowly.   They're contracting.  So your hoping for a safety car effect to come true (although I'm more than willing to accept you had no prior understanding of just what the implications were - and you're clearly now trying to distance yourself from it) would need the richer economies to begin contracting *faster* than Cyrpus - which is looking at around a 10% loss of GDP this year...  

Sounds less than idyllic, but *nope*, let's see if your best wishes of racing poor countries downwards works out for you. I'm sure we're going to get the chance to see to some extent.

I suppose pictures where not as easily available as today, so their reason to pose precisely there might give a clue.


EDIT: (of to bed now): what I gather from the picture (warning: speculation, I'm not a historian):
- the woman/statue is likely a 'plaurant': a grieving woman, which implies it's either a tomb or a memorial
- the background is empty, so it's likely not in a cemetery somewhere. This speaks for it being a memorial.
- the profile looks a lot like Lenin, especially the iconic image I linked to earlier. If he isn't Lenin, one could wonder why they chose that image on the tomb. It could predate Lenin, but the style seems early 20th century to me.
- *enhance*: there seems to be a ??horse?? and a third person on the monument, next to your great-aunt (you can see the hind legs of the horse next to her right arm.
- the text under 'Lenin' seems to be OM. Could this relate to the hand-written text under the image? What's under your thumb?

Re: Discrimination in the past vs. today, the current government is a huge improvement on this issue as opposed to the past, and their attitude is different from what you're (and I was) complaining about. They opened a Kurdish TV run by the government, no more bans or negative attitudes towards the language or the music, they allowed Kurdish language courses, plus Kurdish classes are available in some universities that want to offer them as well. That's what comes to mind just now. There are negatives as well, they've been jailing some journalists and civillian officers for alleged links to PKK, but I can safely say that the Kurds are equal in that sense with Turks as both are being jailed for extended amounts of time with poor reasoning in trials that take forever. 

Not only officials but famous artists and such have indeed apologized for any discrimination they had been responsible for, and the official stance now is to make the past right. You're giving me a report from 2003, which is the year when the current government came to power anyway. You may underestimate the change in government, but it's triggered huge paradigm shifts (both positive and negative) in the country - it wasn't a mere name change as previous changes were. 

Re: Kurdish origin and being openly Kurdish, they are obviously open about being Kurdish, we're not guessing their origins by looking at their faces or by checking family histories, the statistic I gave you was through self-report from the MPs. They haven't always had the opportunity of being open about it, that wasn't possible some 20 years ago, and yet here we are now.

Re: Finland/Canada/Spain, indeed, and Turkey is looking for a feasible solution to this as we speak with the new constitution being written up. Horrible strategies were employed, lessons were learned at the expense of people on both sides, and another solution is being sought as a result.

Re: insulting Ataturk, it's still a crime on paper but I'm not aware of any current trials and accusations regarding that, while I'm aware of many insults and criticisms that could technically be taken to court under that article. What about denying Turkey now? Is that a thing? Do you mean the ""insulting Turkishness"" article? Same thing with that, it's there but not being used to actively incriminate anyone.

Re: who was first, that's not even relevant. Turks don't even claim to be the first nation to live in Anatolia, because that would be ridiculous for anyone who knows a tiny bit of history. They have, however, been the founding force behind the last 3 countries that ruled over Anatolia while Kurdish culture stayed local and remained under the rule of various governments with dominant Persian, Arabic and Turkish cultures. Nothing wrong with that, and doesn't by any means indicate that they should have any less rights. But Turkey having been found with a nationalist ideology rampant in 19th and 20th centuries all over the continent (which brought down the Ottoman Empire as well), was concerned with unity and employed terrible strategies to keep that. As concerned as, say, Greece, to actually [exchange mutual minorities en masse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_exchange_between_Greece_and_Turkey) to avoid future problems. That couldn't be done with Kurds as there was no government to do that with, so the nation state was stuck with a large minority and dealt with it in cruel ways.

Re: education and language, good for Sweden if that's actually possible, I would hope that it would become the case for Turkey as well, and, say, Germany. There are actually schools in Turkey (starting at high school level I believe) that allow this for foreign languages like English, French, German, Italian etc. I honestly don't know if there is a legal or simply a de facto obstacle for the same with Kurdish. **edit:** In fact I also know of primary schools teaching in Russian and Ukranian, so I really don't know what it is legally that prevents similar Kurdish schools from appearing. Perhaps something to do with the distinction between immigrants and local minorities.

Re: bias, I shouldn't say you specifically, because I don't know your personal attitude towards minorities, but I've read enough discriminatory comments on /r/europe to know that not everyone is fine and dandy with demands of minorities and immigrants. As for governmental bias, I linked to Merkel's attitude towards Turkish schools. In general there's a demand towards integration in Europe while the same people demand the opposite from Turkey, and demand that it give certain rights to its minorities when they wouldn't consider that for their own population. I'm all for Turkey granting those rights, but I think Europe should too.

Regardless of all this, I don't think the extreme concern of Gul and Erdogan has any solid basis, and Turkey has a lot of room for improvement itself - I'm more concerned about human rights and freedom of expression in general than ethnic discrimination (which I think has improved a lot) really. Turks themselves suffer quite a bit from their own government's policies.",0,1365885609,null,0,1365944132,0,c9ekjpa,t3_1c7ygd,t1_c9ekjpa,t1_c9ej8hs,null,1431568501,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The german public finances are getting better, says the governement:  Nation, States, communities and national social insurance institutions will have big budget surpluses in the following years. This is information extracted from the new stability prgramm, which will be adopted by parliament later this week and will be send to the European union for control.                                                                
The stability programm is assuming that the budget deficit in 2013 will still be 0,5% of the GDP. Reason is the slow economic growth . In 2014 and 2015 the public budget will be balanced. In 2016 and 2017 the surplus will be over a half percent of the GDP. (14 billion €)
""Germany will, until 2017, be able to fulfill its medium term goal of having a maximum deficit of 0,5%"", writes the ministry of finance in their report.                                                  
The government is assuming that the economic growth in this year will be around 0,4%, next year it will be 1,6% and 1,4% in the following years.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"Thank you, it is interesting to hear your input. 

Regarding immigration, the most clashes I see is when their culture clashes with the Swedish one.

For example, a lot of people, including me, are concerned with some immigration schools because of what they teach, how they look at women, gay, Jews etc. you are not allowed to teach against homosexuality and against the Armenian genocide, or teach that women are inferior for example. For example, a Turkish school in Sweden is not allowed to deny the genocide or teach that women are inferior (not that I know if Turkish schools do that, but some Muslim schools do). Then they should not be allowed to have schools - it is actually the law, but they do not always follow it. Some people see that as discriminatory that they can not teach what they want- I don't.  

Just today a high Swedish politician, Omar Mustafa was forced to leave, since his party basically fired him. They did this that after they elected him, they found out that before he had invited and supported famous anti-gay Muslims and anti-Jewish Muslims, Islamic preachers. Also, his organisations think there should be one law for men, one for women. He said he was being discriminated against because he is a Muslim. I (and everyone t the Swedish board) think it is because he is an ass and if he doesn't believe in equality he should leave, he had nothing to do in that party or in politics. 
That happens a lot. Some ass want to keep being an ass, and hides it behind a ""otherwise you are discriminating me"" attitude. 

And, of course attitudes towards gays, women etc.....
 

So, if you want to be Turkish- fine, but why apply for Swedish citizenship and if you want to live here they should respect not only the law, but human rights, like gay rights, women's right's etc. Some immigrants  do not always do that. A lot do though. ",0,1365889915,null,0,1365890219,0,c9elt16,t3_1c7ygd,t1_c9elt16,t1_c9ekjpa,null,1431567907,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
