true,w00bz,NORW,Norway,"&gt;But that is a crucial part of why so many Americans now thank soldiers: they have a choice.

The problem is that the policy result mostly in people with few options in life enlisting. If the alternative to military service for the lower economic strata is poverty, is that not a form of cohersion? How fair is it that those of least means also have to shoulder the burden of war, and should the defence of the nation be something you can opt out of as a citizen?

&gt;In conclusion, among race, socioeconomic status, and immigration
status, socioeconomic status is the only significant predictor of having ever served in the military. Class differences in military enlistment likely reflect differences in the non-military occupational opportunity, structured along class lines. This research shows that the all-volunteer force continues to see overrepresentation of the working and middle classes, with fewer incentives for upper class participation.

&gt; In this voyage he travelled around and visited a considerable part of Great Britain. He is the first person on record to describe the Midnight Sun. The theoretical existence of a Frigid Zone where the nights are very short in summer and the sun does not set at the summer solstice was already known. Similarly reports of a country of perpetual snows and darkness, the country of the Hyperboreans, had been reaching the Mediterranean for some centuries. Pytheas is the first known scientific visitor and reporter of the arctic, polar ice, and the Germanic tribes. He is the one who introduced the idea of distant Thule to the geographic imagination.

That is true. We've been in the recession for a while and will be for some more time.

&gt;They also had elections that year and elected a socialist government that promissed to keep the welfare state alive.

In our constitution article 2 says: Slovenia is a state governed by the rule of law and a social state. So why shouldn't they keep the welfare state alive?

&gt;Despite the economic situation the Slovenians even today get a 13th salary, unemployment benefits, benefits for the unemployed spouse, child benefits, free healthcare, free education, students get to work with reduced taxes etc.

I'm really questioning what is the bad thing here?

&gt;The largest companies and banks are still in domestic hands despite horrible performance, and whenever a foreign party is interested in buying them, the Slovenian government rallies and rejects the offer.

The largest companies in the goverment hands do work fine. It's the banks that sucks. A couple of years we did sell a share in NLB, but wanted to keep the majority share. Maybe that was a mistake. The rallies and rejections as you desribe them are usually made by the people. Why you ask? Because we have seen when some foreign company buys our company, that makes profit, fires most of employees, moves the production lines to some other company and doesn't give a shit about us. Unfortunately our own companies are now doing this more often.

&gt;The ""bad loans"" story mentioned in this article is a clear consequence of the NLB being in government hands.

As i said before. Rulling elites installed friends to the banks, they loaned huge amount of money to them and friends, they couldn't returned it. So that is true.

&gt;Furthermore, Slovenia is one of the few Eastern European countries that has a large immigrant population, mainly of Serbs and Bosnians. Because of this cheap labour they could build their highways, new apartments and overall the whole infrastructure, for much less money than other countries which had to rely on their own workforce. The Slovenians today admit this. When the economic crisis began, tens of thousands of immigrants lost their jobs and were forced to leave Slovenia. Many of them didn't get paid and still today didn't get their money (we're talking about 3-6 months of unpaid salaries). The disgruntled immigrants returned to their home countries, spread the word about Slovenia, and the country is not as attractive anymore as it once was.

Yes we have plenty of immigrants. 1 of 5 people living here is either an immigrant or descender of an immigrant. We had plenty of migration workes from former Yugoslavia republic, that worked on our development projects. Many left, but plenty have stayed. I know i work in a similar field and i have been working on construction sites. 
On the second matter of not paying a lot of them. That is just shameful. I am ashamed to be Slovenian when i hear that. Government did nothing to help them, managment gets light fines, if even that. 
And this migration workes do come back. Again you'll just have to trust me. Right now not in that high numbers, mainly because there is just not that much work.

&gt;Now that the Slovenians don't have immigrants working for them anymore, they have to find money to pay for their welfare state from some other source. One way was borrowing money. In 2008 the debt to GDP ratio was at around 20%, today it's 46%, more than double the amount!

When the recession came and years after, we had to pump a couple of billions into our banks just to keep them afloat. That + workers losing their jobs so no taxes comeing in meant a smaller budget. We made a mistake not to start saveing emediately and there was no surplus of money from previous ""fat cows"" years meant we had to borrow money. 

&gt;The socialist government (elected during the crisis) tried to execute a few reforms, but being socialist it was against their nature to do austerity without the people's consent. So there was a referendum about raising the retirement age by 2 years. 72% of the voter said no. Then there was another referendum about reducing the tax privileges of the students that worked.

No it wasn't against their nature. If there is 40.000 signature collected, the government has to call a referendum. Current prime minister Janša, was back then in opposition. Because he wanted to get back into power he was suddenly against any and all reformes, so he got the signatures and a referendum. Afcourse people were against working longer, students were against tax increse for them, and the reformes failed. Soon after that there were a premature election, as the government fell, and guess what, Janša got the primeminister spot.

&gt;Under the current system the students delayed finishing their studies because they paid so few taxes that, had they changed their statues from student to fulltime employee, they would get a lesser salary.

Yes the students working law should get a reform. It's sad that the easiest way to find a job is to just inroll into some school to get the student status and only then the company will employ you, because they pay less taxes. But back then when the reform was on referendum, the leader of student organization was closely tied with Janša and after elections in 2011 she got a good job in his circle. So that tells you everything. 

&gt;In 2012, during new elections, the people again overwhelmingly voted for (another) socialist candidate. He eventually failed to create a new government and now they have a right-wing government, which doesn't ask the people anymore. And it's good that they don't.

The funny thing here is that everyone thought that Janša would win easily, but he didn't. Jankovič, opposition leader won. But unfortunately he couldn't create a majority in parliament. Then Janša came. When he wanted to start with reforms, he so vividly and bravely opposed just a couple of years ago, people were against it. He acted all surprised and wtf-y, why the people won't agree with him. He got some reformes trough the parliament, but only because all the facitons agreed. Then came the ""bad bank"" and holdign to parliament. I am happy people are against it. In the bad bank thing, we will have to pay for all the shit him and his friends created. In holding thing, they want to put all the state owned companies under one managment. In some westeren countries that would be awesome thing, because there would be bigger capital that could bring more money. In Slovenia that is a bad thing. PM would install his puppets in charge and eventually, companies would be sold and certain people would get massivly rich, while we would get fucked.

&gt;And it's good that they don't.

Our Anti Corruption Comission last week put out a report that showed Janša has 300.00 euros of money he can't explain. He paid for some travels, with money he can't explain where it came from. He got an apartment in a suspicious way, so i don't belive it's a good thing.",0,1358428612,null,0,1358429550,0,c7yj2j9,t3_16qulb,t1_c7yj2j9,t1_c7yi8di,null,1430991138,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

It's mostly politicians stirring up ancient shit, but it still gets people to follow an ideology based on a 70 year-old conflict instead of deciding based on today's issues.

This gets heated up always when there is a distraction needed for politicians. The PTSD from WW2 is because there were traitors and there were partisans. They want to equalize them both as a fighters for Slovenia. One was collaborating with agressor, one was fighting them. I see a huge difference.

No it's not flawed. Would you happily go to a party where there's no booze, little space, you can't sit down, where you hate all the people, despite the few mates that are present? Because imo, that would be somewhat the equivalent of moving to a country of which you despise the culture.

Sounds like a nice idea but I think unless you really want to make it symbolic, it will be difficult. In Paris you need to first get married at your town or city hall's district before you get married any other way (religiously or not), I think there may be a long waiting list to register too, and then I'm not sure you can even get married outside anywhere in any official capacity. I have many lovely spots to recommend in Paris for an ""exchange of vows"" ceremony perhaps, though outside in February it might be really cold... Try anywhere on the banks of the river Seine on the Ile Saint Louis (a beautiful island in the middle of the river); the Eiffel tower of course, the top of Montmartre Hill at the bottom of the church there (splendid view over the city), and if it's really cold or rainy, try the top floor of the Beaubourg (Pompidou) Museum (make sure it's open that day!) there is a sweeping view of the city from the glass hallway. The Musee d'Orsay is also a fabulous indoor location, also at the top, right behind the giant clock/window which also overlooks the river and the city. Maybe you can just get someone to take pictures of you too. I do know a couple of people who could do that for you. Congratulations!

This seems to be a point of outrage for many Europeans.

The reason that people pay for incoming calls in the USA &amp; Canada (and some other countries) is because otherwise the regulator would have to control prices, like they do in Europe. Having mobile customers only pay for outgoing calls makes a competitive market impossible.

When you only pay for outgoing calls, your carrier charges someone else's carrier every time you receive a call. You as the receiving customer have no interest in keeping that fee down, so it doesn't affect your decision of carrier. The person calling you has no market power over that fee since they can't make you change carrier. Therefore that fee rises and rises, the result of which has been that regulators in Europe spend much of their time fretting over the right place to set it, and the entire marketplace is artificially distorted.

Of course, the mobile market in the USA has a lot of other problems — mostly due to the friction caused by incompatible carrier networks — but honestly I don't think this is one of them. The same approach (receiver pays) works well in Singapore, China and Hong Kong and I believe Australia is in the process of switching too.",0,1358430879,null,0,false,0,c7yjgsz,t3_16qse5,t1_c7yjgsz,t1_c7yhss4,null,1430991338,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

""Wir bedauern sehr, dass in der Öffentlichkeit der Ein- druck entstanden ist, dass Opfer einer Vergewaltigung in katholischen Krankenhäusern nicht mehr behandelt werden dürfen.
Dies ist falsch.
Auch in katholischen Krankenhäusern erhalten die betroffenen Frauen die notwendige Heilbehandlung; dazu gehört gegebenenfalls auch eine volle Kooperation mit der Anonymen Spurensicherung.
Wir haben das feste Vertrauen, dass der Träger der Krankenhäuser, in denen nach Medienberichten eine solche Heilbehandlung abgelehnt worden sein soll, die Gesamtsituation vollständig aufklären und gegebenenfalls Maßnahmen ergreifen wird, um eine Wiederholung eines solchen sehr bedauerlichen Einzelfalls auszuschließen.""

**Cellitinnen:**

&gt;""Die katholischen Krankenhäuser im Verbund der Hospitalvereinigung St. Marien GmbH gewährleisten die medizinische Versorgung aller Menschen im Kölner Norden, egal in welcher medizinischen Notlage sie sich befinden.
In dem genannten Fall vom 15. Dezember 2012 ist es vermutlich zu einem Missverständnis zwischen der Notdienstleistenden Ärztin der GKV-Ambulanz und der Gynäkologischen Klinik des Krankenhauses gekommen, welches derzeit intern geprüft wird.
Eine gemeinsame Aufarbeitung und Klärung des künftigen Verhaltens und Ablaufs ist im Sinne der medizinischen Kooperation sinnvoll und notwendig.
Im Rahmen der Erstversorgung ist uns wichtig, dass alle zeitsensitiven Hilfsmaßnahmen geleistet werden. Außer der Abgabe der Notfallkontrazeption werden alle medizinischen Maßnahmen sofort angeboten.
Dies beinhaltet auch die Kooperation mit der Anonymen Spurensicherung (ASS), sollte sich die Patientin zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt zu einer Strafanzeige entschließen...
Das bedeutet für uns, dass eine vollumfängliche medizinische Versorgung geleistet wird sowie psychologische und seelsorgliche Betreuungsangebote gewährleistet sind (Fürsorge).
Da uns die Entscheidungsfreiheit (Autonomie) der Patientin wichtig ist, kann sie sich selber für oder gegen eine Notfallkontrazeption („Pille danach“) entscheiden.""

true,crackanape,NETH,The Netherlands,"Let's say you are a Vodafone customer and I am a KPN customer. We are in Europe.

When you call me, you pay Vodafone €0.15 per minute. I pay KPN €0.00 per minute to receive the call. KPN charges Vodafone €0.10 per minute to connect the call to me, which makes up most of the charge you're paying.

Because I never see that €0.10 charge myself, I don't think about it or care about it.

You are the one paying it (since Vodafone passes it on to you), but if you think it is too high, there's nothing you can do about it, because the charge was levied by my carrier, not yours. Yours is only acting as a conduit.

Therefore nobody exerts any market pressure on KPN to reduce that fee.

Therefore KPN has every incentive to raise that fee as high as they can.

Therefore the only reason mobile calling is affordable at all in Europe is because regulators step in and put a cap on how much KPN can charge Vodafone.

By contrast, in the system used in the USA and a few other countries, each participant in a call pays all the fees associated with their half of the call. If a Verizon customer finds the fees too high, they can switch to Sprint. Prices are set by competition rather than regulation, to a much greater degree. In theory this is much more efficient and results in lower prices.

In practice, sadly, it doesn't always work that way in the USA because most people are locked into long contracts, and because phones from any one carrier's network are not compatible with most other carriers. This creates friction that prevents people from switching carriers, which means that customers don't have as much power in the market as they should.",0,1358433477,null,0,false,0,c7yk0o4,t3_16qse5,t1_c7yk0o4,t1_c7yjq09,null,1430991585,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Norwegian exports to Gazprom's biggest market are climbing.

Poland is rapidly developing its own shale gas resources, and several other countries in the EU can be either self sufficient or close to it with further development of their own fracking industries. 

Europe is less and less dependent on Russian gas, and all their pipe infrastructure is pointed this way as though we would be dependent on it for the rest of time and always prepared to pay inflated prices. They have spent billions on stupid pipelines whose only purpose is to avoid the Ukraine. At least one goes needlessly under the Black Sea. 

Their major market for expansion is in China. Unfortunately for them that means building more pipelines across larger distances through far less hospitable territory. Even worse, the untapped shale gas reserves in China are estimated to leave China self sufficient in gas for over two hundred years.

true,crackanape,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; Well it seems to me to work out and also be a prime example of when government distortion of the market is good. In Europe the government controls this and as a result prices are lower and the customers get the better deal.

The difference is having a fundamental system in place vs depending on the attitude of the regulator from one year to the next (or, in the case of Europe, one location to the next).

Here in the Netherlands, for example, mobile costs are far higher than in the US. The Dutch telecoms regulator is notoriously subservient to the major carriers, going so far as to take their case against the EU regulator in European issues — and hence working against the interests of all consumers in Europe. 

And telecoms regulations in the EU have been very much driven by a single personality for many years ([Neelie Kroes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neelie_Kroes), ironically also Dutch). When she retires or moves on, it is unclear that the current aggressive corrective policies will continue. If they don't, and carriers are left to their own devices, the landscape could shift radically, leaving consumers across the continent in a bad position, and without any natural market pressure to keep things in order.

At the end of the day, it's a tricky business and there's probably not any one optimal solution (at least not that I've seen so far). I mainly just wanted to correct people's perceptions of the US receiver-pays model as being anti-consumer, when in fact it is exactly the opposite, and is the primary thing keeping prices under control at all in the regulatorily-lax USA.",0,1358436405,null,0,false,0,c7ykrjz,t3_16qse5,t1_c7ykrjz,t1_c7yk73n,null,1430991945,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Some wars are made for ideological reasons. Some wars are waged because of alliance treaties or preservation of a sphere of influence.

France indeed has very egoistical reasons to fight radical islamism : it knows that it is a favorite target of some brands of terrorists and that letting them have a refugee in an autonomous zone is dangerous for it and its citizens as it will make the organization of terrorist bombings easier.

I think that these reasons are credible enough to justify the present war.

One of the comments :

&gt;Fin 2010, j’ai adressé un chéque de 100 euros au Trésor Public. j’avais trouvé dans l’annuaire une adresse postale à Paris. J’y avais joint une note indiquant que je souhaitais apporter une modeste contribution au redressement des finances publiques de la France. Deux mois après, mon chèque était débité sans que j’ai eu à effectuer d’autre démarche ou sans que l’on ait cherché à me contacter.

It says that he just mailed a check to the Treasury with a note and his money was taken without more inquiry. However, others failed.

From the Figaro :

&gt;En France, donner pour réduire la dette s'apparente à un parcours du combattant. Le «don en remboursement de la dette publique» repose en effet sur le mécanisme de la «libéralité en faveur de l'Etat» (art. L 1121-1 du Code général de la propriété des personnes publiques), explique-t-on à Bercy. Il n'existe pas de statistiques sur le montant des dons.

&gt;Le Français doit d'abord se rendre chez son notaire et établir un acte avec mentions légales. Ledit acte est ensuite envoyé au ministère compétent, à savoir celui du Budget. Après l'acceptation expresse des services administratifs compétents, sera publié un arrêté ministériel signifiant que le don est accepté. Enfin, un acte complémentaire sera établi, signé par le donateur et le représentant du ministère, et qui sera enregistré dans les annales. 

TL;DR in theory, it just works like in the US. In real life, you cannot really or maybe you can, but it would be awfully complicated, or maybe not, well nobody really knows.

However, you can help through ""non-direct"" ways, i.e. any association related to the French government or the French army.

We love you.

Others rioted because they are frustrated with the lack of opportunities available for them. Still others rioted because they felt that the normal rules of society had gone and they thought they could get away with something for nothing. (I feel many otherwise innocent kids got caught up in the moment and did not think through what they were doing. I think many of the sentences were overly harsh for first offences too.)

There have been many instances of subcultures rioting in the UK over the years. Usually there is an event that is a catalyst for the riot but the catalyst is not generally the sole reason for it: the people rioting are often the poor and with the sense that there is little opportunity for them to improve their and their children's lives. Often they are right. There are also culture clashes between minority groups, especially where skin colour or dress make it easy for sides to form and individuals to be attacked.

You have to remember the UK has been subject to immigration for thousands of years. The white people of this country are not some elite breed with a single lineage but a rich mix of Celtic, Saxon, Roman, African, Indian and many other 'races'.

People are people are people. Culture changes and the real enemy here is segregation. We should be doing more to encourage people of different cultures and beliefs to mix and understand each other so that there is an appreciation (or at least understanding) of each other, not the fear that tends to spread when different peoples live together. We should also be doing more to reinforce the liberal laws and culture we have formed to date, where people are free to live their lives how they wish so long as it is not to the detriment of others.

Recently a Danish rabbi said that Jews should avoid wearing the kippah around Nørrebro, which is an immigrant-heavy neighbourhood in Copenhagen.

This caused some consternation, and a Jewish journalist decided to see what would happen, so he took a walk there, wearing his kippah, and wrote an article about it.

In general he was unmolested, and even got some nods of respect from older immigrants, I guess as one man of faith to another.

However, he was harrassed a couple of times by youths, in one case even some that went so far as to telling him to take it off and when he refused, saying ""surely you're not willing to die for wearing that?"".

He also interviewed a prominent Danish imam(a native Dane, who converted), who said that the problem was the the muslim youths didn't understand that Islam respects other people's religions.

The imam also advised him to stay away from a housing area called Mjølnerparken, because there would be a high risk of him getting attacked - so he didn't go there.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; And how exactly would an ""Islamist"" state be more of a threat to Europe than a Wahhabi state in Saudi Arabia? Or a Papal State in the Vatican? 

Are you honestly comparing the islamists in Mali to the governments of Saudi Arabia or the Vatican? 

The Islamists have in North Africa have kidnapped a British gas firm just 2 days ago killing 2 people and hold dozens more hostages, they have been at war against the governments of Algeria, Morocco, Mali etc. They did several terrorist attacks in France in the 90's, they did the Madrid train bombings killing **191**.. This is not a problem of a ""Muslim"" government. These are Islamists who have done many terrorist attacks in the past and who have told France they will continue to do so. They hold dozens of European hostages throughout North Africa. Since the 90's, they have been responsible for killing hundreds of Europeans, and thats not even counting the amount of locals they killed. In the Algerian Civil War in the 90's of Islamists against the central government, wikipedia estimates up to 200,000 casualties..

 Until the Saudi Arabian government does similar, this CLEARLY is much more of a threat (not that I like the Saudi government, but comparing the threat of the two is ridiculous). This is without mentioning what they have done to the local Mali population- killing people, raping little girls, destroying all cultural heritage etc etc.

&gt; Let me give you a hint: it is because the perception exists that the West does nothing but prop up the parties that will serve their interests best.

Here I agree with you. Im not saying that an intervention is a great and merry thing to do. In the view of the situation, its the best option however. The islamists in the area are only a few thousand. the majority of all local populations are very much against them. It is better to stop them now then wait for them to take control of a whole government then indoctrinate new people and cause even more havoc in West &amp; North Africa. Even though intervention is not pretty, in the long run its an easier solution for Europe instead of waiting for Mali to become an islamist state where people are trained and indoctrinated for jihad. 


&gt;  Let Africa solve its own problems, we aren't the world police, or the African police for that matte

Its Africa's own problem for the moment. Better stop it now because it will soon become Europe's problem as well very soon. In fact it already is considering how Islamists in Mali already have dozens of European hostages and attacked European interests as recently as 2 days ago. The Mali government **begged** France to intervene. The population is extremely happy France came in, which is a huge surprise, because normally Africans get extremely pissed at French intervention. This just shows how different the present situation is. Like most people Im not a fan of intervening in other peoples countries. But its either that or you have a Rwanda or Srbrenica situation- I will always intervene to protect local civilians


&gt; 'omg the muslims' you don't really have an argument.

No my argument does not boil down to that. Infact, the governments fighting against Islamists in North&amp;West Africa- Mali, Algeria, Niger, Nigeria ARE majoritarily Muslim! And they are AGAINST the Islamists. So its not a question of being anti-Muslim, its a question of being against Islamists who have a track record of killing hundreds of Africans and Europeans and who want to continue doing so

When New Labour began sending more Islamic immigrants here, a big problem was they disliked the Jewish population whove been a respected part of the area for centuries, so we had to have a policeman stand outside the synagogue after some of the muslim community tried to brick it and Jews kept on being assaulted in the area. The Chavs have never done anything beyond getting drunk on the street and passing out, the Muslims are much more violent, they often wait around the main streets to hand out leaflets inciting violence and Jihad against the west, to give up Christianity etc. the police ignore it.

*Text under the video:*

**Rape victim rejected from hospitals**  
A young woman, which apparently was drugged with knock-out drops and later raped was rejected from two catholic hospitals in Cologne. The reason: A prescription of the morning after pill isn't possible out of ethic reasons.

**Video**:

The young woman was going out in Cologne to party and woke up in the afternoon on the next day without any memories of the night. One the same day she went to the medical emergency service with her mother. General practitioner Irmgard Maiworm took care of her and also informed the police. The young woman has been sedated with knock-out drops and afterwards raped. 

And afterwards the Odyssey began. Irmgard Maiworm wanted to forward her to a hospital, she wanted her to have a pelvic  examination, for medical reasons and to secure evidence. But the first hospital, the St. Vinzent Hospital right around the corner, denies and the catholic Heilig Geist Gesundsheitszentrum (holy ghost health center) too rejects the examination. 

Irmgard Maiworm: That's because they would have to inform her about the morning after pill and give her a prescription for it. But that's not compatible with the christian think mindset. 

But hospitals are part of the Callitinnen foundation of the Holy Mary, and this foundation has given out a ethic guideline. No hospital within the foundation is allowed to give out the morning after pill, without any exceptions for rape victims. This is why the doctors refused to even see the patient.

This case is reported to the Cologne police.

Dorothee Göbel (police): We know about the case, we know that the harmed person was rejected at the hospitals and then we drove her to the evangelic hospital in Achtkalk where she was treated and all needed examinations for a criminal procedure have been taken care off. 

The general practiser Imgard Maiworm is indignant, her patient was made a victim once again because of that.

Irmgard Maiworm: I have the patient here, she needs help, she needs the examinations for a court case if she chooses to follow that route and I can't help her because I lack the equipment. Now I have to forward her to another place while she lives through a emotionally hard moment. There she has to tell the upsetting story again. It's strange out of humanitarian reason to reject her in that situation, I'm really disappointed. (TN: She äääähs a lot and the sentences are quite mixed together in her story, I cleaned up a bit)

The arch bishopcy of Cologne didn't want to say anything about that case on camera, same goes for the foundation. In a written statement the foundation says it was a misunderstanding of their doctors, a medical care of rapes is possible in all of their hospitals, but they can't prescribe the morning after pill out of ethic reasons.",0,1358450354,null,0,1358460486,0,c7ypdtr,t3_16r4rr,t1_c7ypdtr,t3_16r4rr,null,1430994244,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

Now, of what I am aware, it is currently the conservatives who have the biggest share of the parliament? Maybe Nick Clegg wasn't able to deliver this promise, as he wasn't the leading party in charge. As you are aware the conservatives at that time didn't want a referendum immediately. That is why he probably was unable to get that through. The Lib Dems might still not be able to get this issue through. After all now that the circumstances changed (They know what  problems this would bring as mentioned earlier), they might not want to do a referenda at all, as the running up to the referendum might already be really bad for the economy as investors/companies may not want that risk and pull out of Britain beforehand.

A thing to add to the previous paragraph, is, that the people I elect, I would want to make the correct decisions so that national interests are preserved. Even if that means breaking an election promise. 

&gt;All the better to have a referendum and put the issue to bed once and for all?

That is a very good point. The problem right now is, that both Cameron and Clegg know that people would vote against EU right now, due to the infamous british newspapers and the recent €-Crisis. Both know though, that leaving the EU is bad for Business. What they want to do against it though, is to stir people towards voting for EU, without invoking uncertainty on the markets.

Nothing homophobic in what she says, nothing religious either, and you can easily apply it to the current debate, which takes into account the fact that a homosexual couple's rights should be strenghtened. However taking a further step does not ***necessarily*** goes as far as the need to give gay people the right to adopt children, what is a view supported by a majority of french people, and (again) not ***necessarily*** for homophobic reasons (cf Guigoux's words).

And if you think about the fact that french people seem to support gay marriage but not adoption, knowing that both are in the same bill prepared by the government, it may seem illogical... when it is not. It simply shows that french people believe, as i stated it above, that gay couple's rights should be strenghtened, as far as it is about the couple itself. When you realise that, and when you know that under french law adoption is included within the marriage regime (talking about adoption by a couple here), you can think of various other ways to give homosexual couples the same rights as those of heterosexual couples: the PACS could be modified, a civil union could be set up...

In this way you'd have a harmonisation of couples' rights, and there'd be far less opposition. And it would seem fair to do it this way. Indeed the law would reflect the views of the majority of people, and as I stated it above, french people support gay marriage but not adoption.

Some things, now:

- please let me know if you find anything homophobic per se in what I explained, or in Guigoux's words (btw if you can't read french, i'll be happy to translate her speech) ;

- please let me know how you feel about hearing the french government willing to go ahead with the current version of the bill, while it also announces that there'll be a debate about family within few months (why not doing it the other way round?) ;

- please let me know if you would find someone xenophobic if he does not support granting voting rights to foreigners as he'd feel that this right should be exercised by nationals only (knowing also that foreigners can apply for citizenship if they meet the requirements set out by law) - if i make this point, it's to try to show that you can be in favour of A  without being necessarily hostile to B ;

During good times, Slovenia started a lot of projects (highways, new trains, stadiums etc.) with the expectation that the economy will grow 5% yearly in the future. When the economic crisis happenned, suddenly you had all this infrastructure that requires maintenance, where's the money going to come from?

1. Loan from banks, or
2. Reduce expenses/increase taxes

So far the Slovenians were loaning. Your tax rates in 2013 are the same as they were in 2008, except that now there are more unemployed so the welfare state costs more and you *should be* paying more, and if we account for the 3% annual inflation, you're actually now paying 15% less than you did in 2008.

I even found a handy table in Slovenian for you: http://www.stat.si/novica_prikazi.aspx?id=4943 (Tabela 2)

In 2007 the Slovenian state collected 13,1 billion euros in taxes, in 2011 13,6 billion. *If* you expect the same level of services as in 2007, you would have to pay at least 15 billions!

You are delusional if you believe Europe will descend into a new Nazi Germany because of Muslims.

&gt; What if I told you that yesterday you also had no ""Muslim patrols"" all over UK, and today you suddenly have them? And that yesterday, you had a healthy jewish community in Malmö, and today you have none?

You think I am not aware of this? People who commit hate crimes and assault and what not should be prosecuted regardless if it is against Muslims or Jews. The Social Democratic major Illmar Reepalu has done nothing for the Jewish community. He has been accused of anti-semitism. He indirectly blames the Jews in Malmö of the actions Israel. He has been criticizer by his own party. I don't know how he is still in office. Also this example is in one city.

&gt; Learn to extrapolate, Swede. I dont have a growing Muslim population in my home country, you do. It is your ass (or even more likely, your girlfriend's) the ""Muslim patrols"" will get, not mine. I'm safe.

Where in the article does it say that immigrants are committing most of the rapes? Where does it say Muslims are doing this? [Rape is unfortunately not a new problem in Sweden.](http://www.rcne.com/downloads/RepsPubs/Attritn.pdf)

&gt; I am merely astonished how the whole of western Europe, not even 100 years after the Nazis ravished it, is allowing a new form of Nazism in the form of Islam to get a foot in the door and let their Schutzstaffel equivalents patrol European cities again like it is 1933.

Islam is not a new Nazism. The Muslims I know are not extreme and some of them are even more liberal than I am. You can't be a moderate Nazi. By convincing people it is a new Nazism you strike fear into people which leads them to having irrational and ignorant thoughts about a group of people whom they've never met. By making statements like you just said proves you are a racist. Maybe you don't think Muslims are a race but the average Jew in Israel is going to look different then the Jew during the holocaust. With that reasoning you could say Hitler wasn't a racist which obviously is not true. You are a xenophobe, you admitted it.

Some info about the car designed by a greek team which will 300 miles to gallon- http://greece.greekreporter.com/2012/12/11/greek-eco-racer-ready-to-roll/


Some quotes from the Digijoural report:

1. ""According to Prison Planet earlier surveys estimated that the value of natural gas resources available for Greece to exploit could exceed $9 trillion. Those surveys did not take into account the Cretan Sea or the Southern Aegean.""

2. ""In August Digital Journal reported ""Analysts gauge that Greece is in fact the richest country in Europe due to its wealth of, yet unexploited, oil and gas deposits. Greece may be on the brink of bankruptcy but its assets have much appeal, especially as the rights to exploit them can be snapped up on the cheap due to the Greek crisis. Whichever country claims the rights has access to what is deemed the largest deposits of oil in Europe, cited in a strategic European position.""

That second quote will give you an idea why greece was targetted by Germany, Germany has a major stake in these gas fields now because of there deliberate sabotage of the greek economy. One thing they did not take into account is that Greek people will not fall for this german thievery again(200 billion was stolen in gold during WW2) . . and we will soon hopefully be gone from the EUro once the gas drills are in the ground to back the new Drachma :)

&gt; Banks loaned huge amount of money to friends and when the recession came they couldn't pay it back

Clearly a consequence of banks not being in foreign hands. Had your banks been owned by international banks, there would be no ""money to friends"", because the CEO in New York wouldn't give a f\*ck about some Slovenian tycoon wanting to build a new villa. Because the Slovenian **people** is so hostile towards foreigners, they are enabling the elite to behave in this corrupted manner.

The story about NLB is just the tip of the iceberg because it's such a large bank. The bank is owned by the state, which means the people have to pay its debt. It doesn't matter at this point if that debt was created unfairly or through corruption. Had NLB been owned by Citibank or Erste or Intesa or other international banks, it would not be the taxpayer's problem whether the bank will go bankrupt or not. Your country would not go bankrupt if the bank does.

And let's not forget that foreign banks *had* tried to buy NLB in the past and the takeovers failed because of public outcry. 

The Slovenians clearly wanted it this way and they should now deal with the consequences, by reducing welfare.

&gt; In our constitution article 2 says: Slovenia is a state governed by the rule of law and a social state. So why shouldn't they keep the welfare state alive?

Constitutions can be changed. It just depends how large of a social downfall it'll take for it to be done. Look at Hungary, they also had a socialist constitution, and it only took something like a 10% recession for them to elect a right-wing government with a large enough majority to rewrite the constitution. You should not dismiss the possibility that, once Slovenia's debt level reaches the 60% mark and your wealth shrinks further, that the people will elect a radical government.

&gt; If there is 40.000 signature collected, the government has to call a referendum

Does it have to take the results of the referendum into account? In almost every modern democracy the referendum is only a *strong advice* to the government, it's not mandatory for it to implement it. The socialists should've shown some balls and ignored the results. Or it should've made a better campaign to convince the populate to vote in favor of the law. Because they did neither of this, I'm convinced that they didn't want to go ahead with austerity anyway (since it's against socialist ideology, for which I understand them), and wanted to redirect the responsibility back at the people.

I have no idea why you elected the prime minister of that same government to be your president now. It's like electing a person who has clearly failed at everything.

&gt;Daniel Strand

The ""Leftist Intellectual"" who called for everyone to call SD fascists because that's ""what they are"" in Aftonbladet, who wrote for Aftonbladet and cheered the attempts of the Occupy Wall Street crowd's attempt at ""dismantling Capitalism"" but said it could not be done around a negotiating table and who whines about how Dagens Nyheter, the Neoliberal rag, shows hate towards ""Leftist intellectuals"" like himself when it decries ""class-hatred rhetoric"" and radicalism. All of which can be found after a few seconds on Aftonbladet's site.

&gt;Neo-Fascism

That's a good start. A favorite of our own Left is to call them Fascists even though they share little to none of it's ideology. (but then he and Sam Carlshamre are the one who claimed we must call them that even though it's utterly inaccurate)

It seems to fail to mention that the current party leads entered the party with the express intent of reforming it in '95 after a reformist was voted in as Party Lead.

&gt;shifted their demonization to Muslim immigrants and scapegoated them for what the party alleged to be social decay in Sweden. 

They've barely spoken about Islam officially outside of like three intervews over the last 7 years beyond saying they think it's disgraceful that we're now accomodating medieval views of women by things like separate time at bath-houses for men and women because it's haram otherwise. There's been two local politicians who've said extreme things and then promptly got excluded on top of that.

&gt;carefully calibrated underdog image

Didn't come to pass until the media took an extremely aggressive, nearly propagandistic stance against them that anyone with eyes could see was not usual. They even called it out once in a debate on the States Television and got applause from the crowd for it. (that they had supposed ""experts"" ready who used terms like ""sickening"" to describe SD's politics) 

&gt;provided a reason to “debate immigration.” 

It was already being debated, ever since the 90s with ""Ny Demokrati"". Only it was in terms of how racist and nazi all the critics of our failed immigration policies were. Valstugereportaget back in 2002 gave the media a field day over the second largest party's supposed racism when lots of local politicians admitted they thought our immigration policies had failed and that certain groups weren't doing much beyond exploiting our welfare system. 

&gt;alleged social decay

Is that supposed to be a joke? Even foreign medias know that Rosengård is a ghettoized hole that our firefighters and medics won't enter without police support depending on the time of day.

&gt;None of the three involved in the incident were expelled from the party or removed from their seats in parliament. 

Almqvist was expelled. Ekeroth was put on time-out. Both weren't ""removed from their seats"" because political parties can not force someone out of their seats once they're in, but Almqvist decided to step down on his own either way.

&gt;In Norway, an outspoken supporter of the Sweden Democrats killed 77 people for their alleged “multiculturalism.

Oh this is cute. Breivik was an ""outspoken supporter of the Sweden Democrats"" my ass. The guy didn't even like his own Norwegian party because they weren't radical enough. That doesn't smack of cheap political rhetoric at all, ""this guy liked them and thus they're as evil as he is"".

Since you posted this I think i'll do the same to you on this matter so no one gets the idea that any comments you make will be impartial or based in facts. I don't find it in the least surprising that your posting history is filled to the brim with the Leftist Extremist EXPO links. Maybe the nice crowd of /r/Europe should get to hear a few choice quotes of one their Trotskyist founding fathers? 

How about Korean-adoptee Tobias Hubinette? (Expo writer between 1995-1997 and one of the founders of the Extreme Leftist Think-Tank according to some within the papers and denied by some, convicted of assault, illegal threats, suspected of an arson attempt on his Ex and murder of a 16-year old skinhead, member of the Trotskyist party along with one of the other founders of the paper Stieg Larsson as well as having worked with a second founder Andreas Rosenlund through the Socialist Front's network ""Stop Racism"") 

""To feel or even think that the white race is inferior in all conceivable levels is natural with it's history and current actions in mind. Let the white race's western land descend into blood and suffering. Long live the multicultural, race-mixed and classles ecological society! Long live anarchy!"" Source: Creol, nr. 1/1996. 

""I simply started attacking and more or less assaulting people who acted racist in my vicinity. It could be anyone from full-fledged skinheads, to children of school age or older gents and dames."" source: Svartvitt, nr. 1/1996

He also had a debate article a year back about pushing up a kindergartner up against a window and has been labeled by the courts as mentally unstable.

Maybe that's unfair you think. Well we could always dredge up those old articles of Andreas Rosenlund calling all those who criticize upped welfare for immigrants-only proponents of apartheid?

Or all the Antifa criminals who've written for them since and still do? Mathias Våg being one of their spokesmen for instance.

Maybe all the Antifa convicted people from Aschberg's (former Maoist who bankrolls a lot of Expo people) other heavily connected Leftist ventures like Piscatus and Strix Television? Martin Fredriksson (""There should be bounty money on whites, especially men"" as he put it), Mikael Ekman etc etc.

true,FrisianDude,FRIE,Friesland,"Christians of that time originated *in* the Roman Empire, if a far-flung region of it, rather than in a wholly different nation. Now I mention nation; there are nationalist factors at work as well, Christianity of that time was an idea to go beyond nationalist boundaries (in so far as they existed), Muslim minorities now in the West tend to be separated not only in which branch of Islam, but also in which nation they originate from, AND they feel opposed by the west. Add to that that the West now is become less and less religious while at the time of Rome, a new religion had far more room to grow simply because far more people were likely to believe and to be convinced. Add to that also that Islam is seen as at odds with Christianity, from similar roots but completely opposite (mind you, they seem pretty much the same to me), while Christianity in its growth during Rome not only based itself on discontent in social form, but also on previous (minor) cults and religions each of which already bore similarities to the growing Christianity. Judaism, of course, was already known, and if someone sympathised with that but was not necessarily convinced, then Christianity might be seen as  a superiour alternative. Similarly the cults of Mithras, and the Zoroastrian religions had some similar tenets to Christianity. Especially Zoroastrianism had, with Ahura Mazda vs Ahriman a very clear duality which the Christians, still developing and transforming their own fledgling religion, would draw heavily from turning what had merely been a sort of prankster into an actual personification of evil (the devil). 

In short; there were already certain religious thoughts and thrifts in pre-Christian Rome which Christianity could take parts from to develop. This is not the case with Islam, both Islam and Christianity are developed and divided in opposing forms. So I don't think it's likely that Islam will have a similar mass-converting effect as Christianity had in Rome, and I certainly don't think it's likely that a future king or queen of England will declare Islam state religion like happened with the Roman emperor who eventually did it (Justinian, I think?)

**In Kosovar Kamenica a group of albanian high schoolers attacked Serbian elementary school children/students while they were waiting for a school bus. In village Rajanovac a Serbian house was burned down.**


Group of albanian hihgschoolers attacked in Kosovar Kamenica Serbian elementary childern while they were waiting for school bus, president of municipality [this isn't completely the correct title but I don't know the correct term] Boban Jevetic said and added that in village Rajanovac an empty Serb house was burned down.


Jevetic said to news agency Beta that the students were attacked last night and that the house was burned yesterday.


Jevetic said that since the beginning of the school year this has been 5th attack on Serbian students who attend elementary school ""Desanka Maksimovic"" and added that there were no serious injuries because the school bus arrived when the fight started.


""A group of 20 Serbian children from village Berivojce, who waited in front of school yard, were attacked by a group of 20 albanian highschool students. A fight started, luckly, at that moment the school bus arrived, the driver opened the door and children were, like in a movie, jumping inside running away from the attackers"", said Jevetic


Jevetic added that because of the frequent attacks from albanians on Serb students in that school an agreement with kosovar police was made that they patrol/guard while the children are waiting for the bus, but last night there wasn't a patrol on a usual spot, which is why the incident occured, in his oppinion.


Elementary school ""Desanka Maksimovic"" is one of the rare Serbian schools in that region which shares yard with albanian elementary school and albanian high-school is 50 meters away.


Jevetic added that the security situation [This refers to general security of living there i.e. how safe is it to live there, I'm not sure if there's proper English term for this] in that municipality was never good, but with latest streak of incidents it has been additionally worse.


""Security situation is currently like that that the parents are considering if they're gonna send their children to school anymore. These kind of incidents remind us where we are, what we are and that we'll never have peace[i.e. we'll always be harrased, not in general sense ""peace/war""] here"", said Jevetic",0,1358458436,null,0,false,0,c7ys8oa,t3_16rbg5,t1_c7ys8oa,t3_16rbg5,null,1430995587,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Do i need to point out that a SD-politician wanted to grant Breivik asylum?

http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/smalandsnytt/sd-politiker-vill-ge-breivik-asyl

&gt;Didn't come to pass until the media took an extremely aggressive, nearly propagandistic stance against them that anyone with eyes could see was not usual.

At first, SD complained that they didn't get any attention. And then when they got attention, they started screaming that the Media was biased and attacking them. 

After Expressen leaked the video of the 3 SD-politicians preparing to beat up a guy with iron-rods and calling a girl whore aswell as pushing another one into a car, everyone started screaming about how the media was biased, compeltely ignoring the fact that no matter of bias changed the content of the video itself.

&gt;There's been two local politicians who've said extreme things and then promptly got excluded on top of that.

Almqvist, the Riksdagsledamot called a girl Whore and a guy for ""blatte.""

Per T K Wahlberg said that Africans are genetically programmed to rape children.


Oleg Datsishin have been calling lone-arriving fugitive children for ""mustachewomen.""

Annika Rydh have demanded that muslim women be forced to have a restriction on how many children they are allowed to have.

Lars Isovaara spit on a security guard who tried to help him and said that he ""didn't want anything to do with people like him"" aswell as made pig-noises.

And that is just a short collection of what the SD-**politicians** are doing.

Also, a few surveys have shown that SD-polticians have by far the highest debt-rates:

* SD 17,5% / 12,2%

* V 7,1% / 4,0%

* MP 4,7% / 2,2%

* M 3,7% / 1,5%
* C 3,3% / 0,6%
* S 3,3% / 1,4%
* FP 2,8% / 1,3%
* KD 2,1% / 0,8%

true,JebatGa,SLOV,Slovenia,"&gt;And let's not forget that foreign banks had tried to buy NLB in the past and the takeovers failed because of public outcry.
The Slovenians clearly wanted it this way and they should now deal with the consequences, by reducing welfare.

Well at the time people tought that keeping the bank in majority state ownership was the best thing. There were some talks about selling it whole, but nothing came of it. 

&gt;You should not dismiss the possibility that, once Slovenia's debt level reaches the 60% mark and your wealth shrinks further, that the people will elect a radical government.

Funny you mention it. Right now there is a right leaning government. With ""bad bank"" and state holding and the recent relese of a report by a anti corrupiton commision, that showed Janša is corrupt asshole (the same goes for the opposition ""leader"") government is seriously losing its support. Right now the most popular party is a left leaning and if there were election right now we would get left leaning government.

&gt;Does it have to take the results of the referendum into account? In almost every modern democracy the referendum is only a strong advice to the government, it's not mandatory for it to implement it. The socialists should've shown some balls and ignored the results. Or it should've made a better campaign to convince the populate to vote in favor of the law. Because they did neither of this, I'm convinced that they didn't want to go ahead with austerity anyway (since it's against socialist ideology, for which I understand them), and wanted to redirect the responsibility back at the people.

It goes like this. First there is a law accepted by parliament. If people think it's bad there are two ways for the law to go to referendum. First way is if 30 members of parliament sign a thing and then referendum is a go. Second one is if a party, group... collects 40.000 signatures. 

When there is a referendum it's mandatory whatever the result is. Government can accept same law after 1 year wait and there are some process for accepting it (i think, don't quote me on it).

On our referendum in the previous government opposition leader, Janša, was really fighting them. There was no chance for them at that time. He was just to much power hungry. 

&gt;I have no idea why you elected the prime minister of that same government to be your president now. It's like electing a person who has clearly failed at everything. Another proof the Slovenians are politically immature.

Well he was a good candidate, with an excellent public campaign and with a support from right and left. Especially when the candidate from the right completely burned in first round.  

He was OK. He was fighting for the reformes very hard, but Janša had the support from all the sides. From press and church, so Pahor burned down. 

As for politically immaturity. That is true. We have members of parliament who have proven cheated on ther education papers (like diplomas and stuff), who are charged for crimes and still they don't wan't to resign from parliament. Hell our PM was just accused of haveing 300.000 euros he can't explain where they come from and major of Ljubljana has 2.400.000 euros he can't explain. We elect mayors, politician etc. who are corrupt, steal, lie, and many more. Yet nothing happens.

&gt;
Die junge Frau hatte Schmerzen, auch beim Toilettengang. Sie brach in Tränen aus, als ihr Irmgard Maiworm klarmachte, dass sie womöglich vergewaltigt worden war – und im schlimmsten Fall schwanger sein könnte. Maiworm verschrieb die Pille danach und rief die Polizei. Außerdem rief sie im nahe gelegenen St. Vinzenz-Krankenhaus an, damit die junge Frau dort untersucht würde. Dies ist in jedem Fall von Vergewaltigung wichtig, wenn Polizei und Staatsanwaltschaft Ermittlungen aufnehmen.
&gt;
Doch das katholische Krankenhaus, das von der Stiftung der Cellitinnen zur Heiligen Maria geführt wird, ließ die Ärztin abblitzen. Eine Assistenzärztin erklärte, zu einer Untersuchung nach sexueller Gewalt gehöre auch ein Gespräch über die „Pille danach“, die mit dem katholischen Gedankengut nicht vereinbar sei. Deswegen könne man auch die Untersuchung nicht durchführen.

""Alternate member"" (ie, backbencher) local politician and a quick google tells me he was excluded over it. 

&gt;And then when they got attention, they started screaming that the Media was biased and attacking them. 

Which they are? Even a quick google for anyone interested would tell them as much with even the neutrals holding the debates making snide remarks about them at times.

&gt;everyone started screaming about how the media was biased

Not really. Åkesson calmly said it's an issue that they were dealing with, ended up punishing them and then the party rose by 2% in the polls as a result of his handling of the situation.

&gt;Almqvist, the Riksdagsledamot called a girl Whore and a guy for ""blatte.""

Excluded as a result.

&gt;Per T K Wahlberg said that Africans are genetically programmed to rape children.

Excluded and stepped down from his position.

&gt;Oleg Datsishin have been calling lone-arriving fugitive children for ""mustachewomen.""'

He called them ""beardchildren"" as well. Which was pointing out that a great deal of the people coming here under our children's refugee program are actually young adults around 18-25 years old because we don't actually check their age. (this can be seen easily enough in local communities where the ""children's refugee centers"" have lots of beards about)

They're still considering if he should be excluded or not (according to the papers from around September 2012) though he has been chastised for his statement almost immediately afterwards in an open letter by Åkesson. 

&gt;Annika Rydh have demanded that muslim women be forced to have a restriction on how many children they are allowed to have.

Under investigation and is almost guaranteed to be kicked out.

&gt;Lars Isovaara spit on a security guard who tried to help him and said that he ""didn't want anything to do with people like him"" aswell as made pig-noises.

Excluded very openly over it.

Noticeably most of these are local politicians. 

&gt;Also, a few surveys have shown that SD-polticians have by far the highest debt-rates

Is that supposed to be worrisome? They haven't had politicians income for over more than three years.

This is important for every rape case as the police and state prosecutor start their investigations .

But the catholic hospital, which is lead by the foundation Callitinnen of Holy Mary meet the physician with a rebuff.

This goes against the trend of most immigrants where 2nd gen kids tend to be British in their culture, and third ones are at most a different colour but nothing else. I know third gen Polish immigrants who're so British they shit the queen and piss milky tea, but for some reason with all the Pakistanis and Bangladeshi's we imported in the '60's and 70's, despite their parents generally being fairly moderate, a subsection of them have decided to go full retard.

Then in 1990 referendum people voted 88% for leaving the socialist heaven that the good partisans fought and died for and everyone voting against independence is now branded as scum of the earth by all sides, including the left that's now ranting on how horrible the anti-communists were by taking weaponry from Germans.

true,Kit_Emmuorto,vaticano,,"&gt; if this is not a time for political upheaval, then when will it occur?

This implies that a political upheaval is something that in the end results to be somewhat necessary to clear things up and get a fresh start. The last time we experienced such an upheaval in order to drain down the sink the ineffective shit we had held onto until then and rise from our ashes was exactly twenty years ago, and turnes out we were unknowingly clearing the path for that Silvio guy and for two decades of something that only people with as musch sense of humor as us could dare to call ""second republic"".

The reason why the possibility for an upheaval to occur scares me is exactly this: that analogies with the early nineties are beginning to grow: financial turmoil, technocracy and politics massively merging together, a general and incredibly high general distrust felt by the people towards political parties and politics itself (which is a cause for the general political mainframe to undergo severe and often painful adjustments), conflicts among state's powers. If recent italian history proves something, it's that we are incredibly bad at figuring out what the right thing to do is when facing crucial scenarios. So, resorting to a comedian who clealry does not have a clue about what he's talking about and placing the hopes of a whole nation upon him might not be the brightest idea.

true,r0ckarong,flag-de,,"Wenn dir bewusst ständig Dinge auffallen die dich über einen Austritt nachdenken lassen dann ist es nur konsequent das auch zu tun. 

Soziale Einrichtungen tragen sich ja nicht allein von der Kirche und um ehrlich zu sein finde ich die Idee soziales Engagement an einen Glauben zu binden ziemlich widerlich. Gläubig oder nicht, der Grund warum die Kirche soziale Einrichtungen betreibt ist historisch betrachtet der Missionierung geschuldet. Niemand hält dich davon ab nach dem Austritt deinen KSt. Anteil an andere Organisationen jenseits der Kirche zu überweisen. Es gibt mehr als genug Stellen an denen du mit deinem Beitrag humanistische Hilfe leisten kannst.

Ich finde es etwas dämlich zu sagen ""Ich will nicht in der Kirche Mitglied sein die solche Dinge veranstaltet"" aber gleichzeitig alle Türen offen stehen haben wollen was bestimmte Einrichtungen angeht. Da muss man sich dann eben den Schuh anziehen und darauf verzichten. Ich bin vor acht Jahren ausgetreten und habe noch nicht ein einziges mal irgenwelche Auswirkungen davon gehabt. Ich werde bestimmt bei kirchlichen Arbeitgebern weniger gern gesehen und darf nicht kirchlich heiraten oder meine Kinder taufen aber das sind alles Dinge die ich rein aus Überzeugung eh nie wollte.

Ich weiss nicht wirklich welche Art Einrichtung in Trägerschaft einer Kirche du meinst oder was du da willst aber eine ""Bildung"" die sich an deiner Mitgliedschaft in einer Kirche misst kannst du eh gleich in die Tonne treten. Austritt heisst halt Austritt. Ich kann auch nicht Vegetarier werden und sagen ""aber BigMac esse ich trotzdem noch"". Was du beschreibst ist doch noch ein Grund mehr diese Einrichtungen zu meiden. Was für ein ekelhafter Verein macht es davon abhängig Leuten Wissen vorzuenthalten je nachdem für welche Geschmacksrichtung ihrer Einbildungskraft sie sich entschieden haben?

Wenn du weder gläubig bist noch dein Leben religiös führst dann gehörst du zu den vielen Kollateralgläubigen in Deutschland die durch ihre Familien pauschal in das System Religion geworfen wurden ""weil das war halt so"". Ich hab meine 35€ Gebühren (das war 2005) bezahlt und seit dem viel Geld und Nerven gespart weil ich mich zu Recht über die Kirchen aufregen darf und weiss dass ich für meinen Teil da nichts mit zu tun habe.

Die Praxis der Taufe ist mir als Atheist vollkommen zuwider eben aus diesem Grund, ICH muss Geld dafür bezahlen eine Verurteilung meiner Person loszuwerden die mir meine Eltern aus Gruppenzwang auferlegt haben. Einfacher kann man einen Austrittsgrund garnicht umschreiben.

""Pizza! Pinatas! Hide-and-Seek! Donuts for Breakfast! We're having a sleep over!

Pizza! Pinatas ! Cache-cache! Des donuts pour le ptit-dej! Nous invitons votre enfant à une soirée pyjama!

Please RSVP if your child is going to come, so I can get an accurate count of how much food/ how many drinks and favors to get. 

Merci de répondre svp si votre enfant souhaite venir, afin de pouvoir gérer au mieux la quantité de nourriture et boisson.

We're starting around 5:00 pm on Saturday, and pick-up will be at noon on Sunday. Also, if for some reason your child can't come, don't worry, we're going to try to do this again before the school year is over. Feel free to call with any questions!

La soirée commence vers 17h samedi et vous pourrez le récupérer dimanche midi. Si pour une quelconque raison votre enfant ne peut venir, ne vous en faites pas, ~~une fois l'année scolaire finie~~avant la fin de l'année scolaire, nous avons prévu de réorganiser une telle soirée. N'hésitez pas à appeler si vous avez des questions.

no presents, please-- it's not a birthday""

http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2800/Europese-Unie/article/detail/3378708/2013/01/17/Dat-Jeroen-Geen-Kandidaat-Dijsselbloem-het-wordt-staat-voor-de-Kamer-vast.dhtml

says so as well. You likely can't read Dutch so I'll give a translation of the last paragraph, which is most relevant.

&gt;De weg voor Dijsselbloem ligt dus open, wat betreft het Nederlandse parlement. En ook in Europa zijn er, wederom naar verluidt, weinig drempels meer. Alleen Frankrijk sputtert nog wat. Vandaag riep de Franse minister van Financiën Moscovici in de Duitse pers op tot een visie op de euro van de beoogde eurogroepvoorzitter. Dijsselbloem zal aan die oproep tegemoetkomen en maandag zijn visie presenteren in de eurogroep. Dan wordt meteen duidelijk hoe de pet van Dijsselbloem staat. .

For Dijsselbloem the road is, therefore, open, at least in regards to Dutch parliament. In Europe there seems to be little thresholds left, according to hearsay, only France is still 'sputtering' (this feels like it should be a word in English. :P)  Today the French minister of Finance Moscovici called in the German press for the aspiring eurogroupchairman to present a vision on the euro. Dijsselbloem shall acquiesce to that call and will present his vision in the eurogroup on monday. ""Then we'll see which way his hat points."" (Idiom, not very suitable for translation.)

true,BobLeeJagger,UKGB,United Kingdom,"TL;DR Leaked press releases suggest that his ""big euro speech"" would look something like this:

“I want to speak to you today with urgency and frankness about the European Union and how it must change – both to deliver prosperity and to retain the support of its peoples. I come here as British Prime Minister with a positive vision for the future of the European Union. A future in which Britain wants, and should want, to play a committed and active part.

Why raise fundamental questions about the future of Europe when Europe is already in the midst of a deep crisis? Why raise questions about Britain’s role when support in Britain is already so thin? There are always voices saying don’t ask the difficult questions. But it’s essential for Europe – and for Britain – that we do because there are three major challenges confronting us today. 

First, the problems in the Eurozone are driving fundamental change in Europe. Second, there is a crisis of European competitiveness, as other nations across the world soar ahead. And third, there is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in Britain. 

If we don’t address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and the British people will drift towards the exit. I do not want that to happen. I want the European Union to be a success and I want a relationship between Britain and the EU that keeps us in it. That is why I am here today: To acknowledge the nature of the challenges we face. To set out how I believe the European Union should respond to them. And to explain what I want to achieve for Britain and its place within the European Union. 

If we don’t address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and the British people will drift towards the exit. There is a growing frustration that the EU is seen as something that is done to people rather than acting on their behalf. And this is being intensified by the very solutions required to resolve the economic problems. People are increasingly frustrated that decisions taken further and further away from them mean their living standards are slashed through enforced austerity or their taxes are used to bail out governments on the other side of the continent. 

My point is this. More of the same will not secure a long-term future for the eurozone. More of the same will not see the European Union keeping pace with the new powerhouse economies. More of the same will not bring the European Union any closer to its citizens. More of the same will just produce more of the same – less competitiveness, less growth, fewer jobs. And that will make our countries weaker, not stronger.”",0,1358505656,null,0,false,0,c7z4794,t3_16t79u,t1_c7z4794,t3_16t79u,null,1431001482,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,tuwxyz,EURO,Poland,"In the beginning I would like to state that IMO municipal services should not be privatized.

Here is the reply from EC:

&gt; There is no obligation under the EU Treaties for Member States, including the programme countries, to privatize the water sector.  
&gt;
&gt; Given the overall budgetary constraints and the need to stabilize and reduce the level of public debt, some EU governments have available limited public resources for sustaining medium term oriented investment projects aiming to modernize the water sector.
&gt;
&gt; The process of modernisation can happen both in a regime of public or private property of water utilities and EU wide experience offers a variety of different models. The Commission position on this is neutral in accordance with article 345 of the TFEU. In this context, the Commission considers that the creation of a regulatory authority and an appropriate market functioning environment are crucial prerequisites for guaranteeing the success of a privatization process while protecting consumers' interests, should governments choose to move to a regime of private property.
&gt; 
&gt; The Commission would also like to state that its proposal for a Directive on the award of concession contracts does not affect in any way the discretion of national, regional and local authorities to decide on the most appropriate means of  providing services, including water, to the public. These can either be provided directly by the public authorities themselves or outsourced to a third party. However, the award of a concession contract to a third party for the provision of water services will have to comply with the proposed rules as well as with the principles of equal treatment, non-discrimination and transparency of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

I can't see any controversial views in that reply. I can't see any madness or reason for EC to be disbanded as other redditors in this thread do.

It is not the EU trying to privatise water. It is local governments, which try to limit budget deficit.

true,killerstorm,UKRA,Ukraine,"&gt; So does anyone in Ukraine still buy from Gazprom, if RWE is cheaper?

1. RWE can offer a limited volume at that price.
2. Transportation capabilities from that direction might be also limited.
3. Gazprom has contract with Ukraine's Naftogaz: Naftogaz must pay for certain volume even if it doesn't use it.
4. Individual companies don't often have an option to shop around. However, some can. For example, Dmitry Firtash is able to buy cheap gas from eastern countries for his companies because he has ties with Russian and Ukrainian governments.

&gt; I don't know so much about Ukrainian politics, but I heard (just heard is all) that Tymoshenko was locked away on the pretence of giving Gazprom too good a deal.

This is true, but Yanukovich's government wasn't able to get a better deal either. They tried really hard, for years.

I don't think anybody can get a better deal without agreeing on Russia's demands, which basically means getting under Russia's influence.

* Rimprovera uno del pubblico che lo stava incitando: ""non devi fidarti neanche di me, ma di quello che vedi"". [NB: d'ora in poi sono citazioni approssimative]
* Perugia ai primi posti nel consumo di cocaina, 60 anni di governo sempre uguale.
* Stanno devastando con le centrali a biomasse.
* Città pulita, 70% di riciclaggio ma pagano tasse sui rifiuti più alte d'Italia.
* Il problema simboli farlocchi, lo Stato non c'è più, troppa burocrazia, niente data sulla Gazzetta Ufficiale, 3 giorni di fila e sgomitate, moduli diversi da regione a regione.
* Abbiamo raccolto 200.000 firme e lo Stato cosa fa? Le decurta del 75%.
* I politici hanno paura della piazza, dopo la disperazione la paura è un toccasana.
* Ha 2 studi legali per star dietro alle scartoffie.
* Hanno cercato di tenerci fuori. Mai successe elezioni a Febbraio. I Consolati hanno messo i bastoni fra le ruote.
* Le regole per le elezioni le fanno durante le elezioni.
* Non c'è un candidato premier perché non c'è il premierato in Italia.
* Piove, governo tecnico.
* Tutte le TV del mondo si interessano perché stiamo facendo qualcosa di strano.
* Ci andiamo poco in TV, ci andrò anch'io, ma non i talk show.
* Sono i media che tengono in vita questi fantasmi (i politici).
* Il Patto di Stabilità non si capisce (legge l'incipit).
* Non è solo questa piazza piena, ci sono 5.000 persone in streaming (web TV 24h).
* Ci accusano di non avere esperienza politica, sì, l'esperienza di prendere 3,5 miliardi di euro alle nostre spalle e premere bottoni per votare leggi che non capiscono, poi arriva una con le tettone e lasciano la famiglia.
* Quali partiti vi fanno conoscere i candidati 1 mese prima delle elezioni? Prima volta nella storia elezioni online, abbiamo il 55% di donne, sono tutti incensurati. 
* Quando il voto è libero, la gente vota le donne, ecco perché ce ne sono pochissime in Parlamento.
* In TV non si parla più di antipolitica perché sono diventati loro l'antipolitica, con partiti col 60% di condannati.


Uff... Questi sono i primi 18 minuti. Scusa ma non ce la posso fare a continuare il resoconto fino alla fine. Aggiungo solo alcuni punti importanti:

* Abolizione del precariato.
* Reddito di cittadinanza per 3 anni a tutti i maggiorenni italiani senza lavoro (a patto che non rifiutino le offerte dei centri per l'impiego), abolendo le altre forme di sostegno al reddito e finanziandolo con un taglio radicale di superstipendi e pensioni d'oro dei dirigenti statali.
* Rinazionalizzazione di beni e servizi strategici come energia, petrolchimico, telecomunicazioni e autostrade. Internet gratuito.
* Introduzione del Referendum Propositivo senza Quorum.
* Rinegoziazione della permanenza nell'Euro o, se i cittadini sceglieranno in tal senso, ritorno alla Lira (il M5S è per dare la scelta, non per l'uscire per forza).",0,1358508161,null,0,false,0,c7z4h7g,t3_16pbrk,t1_c7z4h7g,t1_c7z22bf,null,1431001618,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

true,silence_hr,CROA,Croatia,"""Marš na Drinu"" is Serbian nationalistic poem that sings about blood in river Drina.

To understand why it might be a problem you have to see where is Drina - border between Serbia and Bosnia and the word ""marš"" (march) is used for military formations.

The biggest problem is that is calls for blood in river Drina and Serbian chetniks used to kill Muslims on bridges over the Drina river and dump bodies in the river.

They did that in WW2 and during Bosnians war 1992-1995.

Srebrenica, place of worst massacre in Europe since the end of WW2 in which Serbs killed over 8000 men is also located by Drina.

Here is what was going in Foča, another town on Drina.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fo%C4%8Da_massacres

&gt;The Foča massacres, also known as the Foča genocide, were a series of killings committed by Serb military, police and paramilitary forces on Bosniak civilians in the Foča region of Bosnia and Herzegovina (including the towns of Gacko and Kalinovik) from April 7, 1992 to January 1994. In a 1997 judgement against Novislav Đajić, the Bavarian Appeals Chamber ruled that the killings in which he was involved in June 1992 were acts of genocide.[1]

-

&gt;Some 2,704 people from Foča are missing or were killed during the massacres period.[2] Additionally, Serb authorities set up locations - commonly described as rape camps - in which hundreds of women were raped.[3][4]

true,Deusdies,EART,Earth,"""Marš na Drinu"", for one, is not a song, it's just music. There are no lyrics. Lyrics were made up later. It was the song the Serbs came up with while fighting the occupying forces of Austria-Hungary (who were mostly Croats, now that we're insulting each other on a national level) and trying to kick them out of the Serbian territory. 

It most definitely does NOT call for muslim killing etc. Really low shot by you trying to blame the Serbs for everything, as usual, silence_hr. 

The ""Marš na Drinu"" was composed 100 years before Srebrenica massacre - and the civil wars, so I'm not sure what the hell you're talking about.

In fact, here are the complete lyrics of the Marš na Drinu (most popular version). We'll leave the Court of the Public to judge on it:

To battle, go forth you heroes,

Go on and don't regret your lives

Let the Cer see the front, let the Cer hear the guns

and the river Drina's glory, courage!

And the heroic hand of the father and sons!


Sing, sing, cold water of the Drina,

Remember, and tell of the ones whom fell,

Remember the brave front, full of fire and mighty force

Whom expelled the invaders from our dear river!


Sing, sing, Drina, tell the generations,

How we bravely fought,

The front sang, the battle was fought

Near cold water

Blood was flowing,

Blood was streaming by the Drina... for Freedom!

---------

Therefore, just because some idiots were singing it because they were killing people in Bosnia, it does NOT make it a nationalistic song. What if someone had been going around singing the Croatian anthem while murdering kids - would that make the ""Lijepa Naša"" a nationalistic song?

true,arnoooooo,null,null,"Thanks for a detailed answer.

I think this speech by Elisabeth Guigoux boils down to this extract : ""Pourquoi l’adoption par un couple homosexuel serait-elle une mauvaise solution ? Parce que le droit, lorsqu’il crée des filiations artificielles, ne peut ni ignorer, ni abolir, la différence entre les sexes. Cette différence est constitutive de l’identité de l’enfant.""

This argument is at the very least ignorant.

First because it completely ignores reality. She might not like it, it might even be bad for the children (I'll get to that later), but these families with same-sex parents exist even though they can't marry (and by the way, so do single parent families, which don't provide a difference between sexes either). Such families will exist as long as people have the freedom to form the romantic associations they wish. In this context, the state is not asked to sanction one form of union or another : adoption and marriage are ways to protect these children and these families. Of course you have to acknowledge that the feelings in a same-sex couple are the same as in an heterosexual one, which she seems to do, or at least pretends to.

Second, the argument is ignorant because studies have proved that children do very well with same-sex parents : a little extract from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_parenting
&gt; Scientific research has been generally consistent in showing that gay and lesbian parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents.[3][4][5] Major associations of mental health professionals in the U.S., Canada, and Australia have not identified credible empirical research that suggests otherwise.[5][6][7][8][9] Based on the robust nature of the evidence available in the field, the Third District Court of Appeal of the State of Florida was satisfied in 2010 that the issue is so far beyond dispute that it would be irrational to hold otherwise, and concluded that the best interests of children are not preserved by prohibiting homosexual adoption

Third, this is as you say an argument about adoption, not marriage. Marriage does not imply adoption. The only link between both is that if married people adopt, they both do. Single people can adopt. Adoption for same-sex couples is therefore a clear matter of equality, no matter your views on marriage. Furthermore, people who systematically bring up the topic of children in relation to marriage are just reacting viscerally : none of them would oppose the union of a man and woman who can't have children or don't want to. Think about a couple of 80 year olds who wouldn't even be granted an adoption. Everybody would think it's cute that they're getting married. The only difference is actually that in this case, they recognize the feelings. I find it surprising that it's so difficult to recognize those feelings in a same-sex couple.

To conclude, the argument is homophobic (if that's what matters here), in that it ignores the reality of homosexual parents and is based on an irrational fear (phobia) that they are not adequate parents. You'll also notice that it's an argument that's much more easily conceived with religious notions of a ""natural order"" than without them.

Regarding the opportunity of doing this now versus waiting for the debate about family, I think this makes sense for a few reasons :

First, this is an important issue that would have been likely to eclipse the other issues in a debate about family.

Second, the opposition knows it can leverage this specific issue because of a vocal opposition. It would be silly of the current government to bring this up too close to elections. 2014 will see both municipal and European elections.

Finally, I understand there is a clear majority of French people who support this, so we might as well not make families with same-sex parents suffer any longer.

Many immigrants who come to, for instance Sweden where I live, don't neccessarily want to become Swedish at ALL. Indeed, why would they want to adapt a whole new set of rules and social values? If your life has revolved around a certain religion for all of your life, why would Swedish atheism appeal in even the least to you?

No, what most immigrants naturaly wish for is to live here the way they did back home, only with our standards and to live in peace. Indeed I would not adopt Saudi values even if I moved to Medina, nor would I adopt Mongolian values if I moved to Ulanbator. I'd remain a secular socialist Swede nomatter where I would go.

As for an immigrant committing a crime, here in Sweden, people from Thailand, New Zeeland, the Philippines, Vietnam, and India just to mention a few, actually commit slightly FEWER crimes than Swedes. On the other hand,  over 20% of the Somalis and the Iraqis have been arrested for crime which is over 500% more than the Swedish average.

Now, this means that 80% have NEVER been arrested for a crime, but sadly 20% can ruin a lot for the group as a whole.

In Sweden, we do have real problems that can't be ignored with the standard go to comments in defense of multiculturalism due to the simple fact that it is so visible by this point, the result is there for everyone to se and many immigrants are actually voting for the Swedish Democrats who want to make immigrationlaws more strict.

I mean, things like this video depicts doesn't go by unnoticed no matter what people say in defense of it.

It's a problem. However to claim that it is a new problem you have to look at statistics from 1992 or a similar to year to observe how much it has increased. These statistics are difficult to interpret because there are different definitions of sexual violence or rape for every EU country. Especially like you said the definition has been widened.

That bogey man, as far as I'm concerned, does not exist*. Everyone agrees that all must be subject to civil law. Everyone agrees with integration in the long run. The differences are in the best ways to achieve that. The actual policy differences which are reasonably available, while maintaining the basic principles of Western democracies, are pretty small, and a matter for technical debate. Otherwise, it's a matter of tone, one side doesn't want to tar all immigrants (or in this case Muslims) with the same brush, the other wants more of a combative approach. Well, that's fine, and subject to debate. For instance, we can debate the different approaches towards FGM in France and Britain. But instead of debate, these threads are just filled with vague but nevertheless strongly worded clash of civilizations rhetoric. Most of the articles posted are about isolated events, to pander to preconceptions without any wider evidence provided. The theology discussion operates on the level of 'Leviticus says that eating shellfish is forbidden, therefore Christians will never reconcile themselves to eating mussels'. A lot of the policy proposals are out of far right manifestos. To disagree with this is not to be in favour of some straw man multiculturalism.

If he has the passage and the landlord agreed to your stay this contract is valid as well. In this case he should have something written down and signed by the landlord or at least one other withness to confirm this.

Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*[Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.
*[Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 
*[Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing
*In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!
*Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.
* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)
* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above
* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;hl=de&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=18)  as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.bamberg-guide.de/bamberg/bierundbierkultur/kellerbilder/titelfoto-bearbeitet.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.
* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;num=30&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;t=h&amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;radius=15000&amp;t=h&amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.
*Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recomment ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**
*[Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here
*[Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)
*Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see
*Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live, and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car.
*[Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremburg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle there and live there.
*[Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.
*The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.
*At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"To a certain extent I agree. It's clear that there are many different permutations of identity which are available to people living together as a group, whether they associate with a village, aristocratic family, religion, territory, language, or whatever. 

But equally, when people talk about nationalism being a post Victorian blip or the problems of defining what it means to be British, they are referring to the particularly strong or neat form of nationalist ideology, separate from what a nation state actually implies. You might say the same about British architecture, landscape, or weather- it is difficult to define, but nevertheless it is different. What this means is that it cannot be described solely as a set of rules, in the way that fascists attempted to define all elements of life in terms of national identity. Nor should it attempt to eliminate all competing and/or complementary identities.

The wider concept of nationalism, as a  group identity, partly self-defined, partly indefinable, and associated with real or desired political power, is something which has always existed, at least after the formation of modern civilization, albeit with varying levels of complexity and geographical reach.

And it seems to me that democracy places a further requirement, because it is fundamentally a system based on majority decision making, and also places great emphasis on ruling by consent. You don't have despot who puts all groups under his thumb. And it is not enough to simply have tolerant and open rules without common agreement on those rules, because tolerance and openness are themselves political ideas which people may disagree with. You must have relatively shared political values, or else common rules cannot be agreed upon, even if the agreement is not to have rules.",0,1358524469,null,0,false,0,c7z7mp8,t3_16sanw,t1_c7z7mp8,t1_c7z6l0i,null,1431003098,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The lack of skillset comes in combination with vast cultural differences.

Of course there's the ""everything goes with informed consent"" approach, but this is flawed in several ways. ""Informed"" implies that users understand [what is possible](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=all) with data (tl;dr: supermarkets can tell when customers are pregnant and even predict when they're expected to deliver by observing changes in purchase patterns), especially once you combine several databases. The ""consent"" part is even more interesting. Take Facebook, for example. You don't have to join, but when most of your friends use it to plan events and share the chatter and social knowledge that binds groups together, the price for not ""consenting"" is that you lose touch with your real-life social environment.  
Then, there are developments that go beyond individual consent, and affect society as a whole. Take Klout, for example. You don't even have to know what a ""[Klout score](http://www.wired.com/business/2012/04/ff_klout/)"" is (tl;dr: it measures influence in social media, like Twitter followers and number of Facebook friends) to get preferred treatment by companies hoping you'll tell everybody of their great service because you happen to have a high one. So, good for you if you do. But if some get the VIP treatment, then the others become second class.

On the other hand, who doesn't want the benefits? The more Google knows about you, the better it can find relevant information for you. That they show you local pizza delivery services when you share your location is only the beginning. Google Now can prompt you when it's time to leave for the airport if you have received the booking confirmation over Gmail, based on current or predicted traffic conditions on your route to get there.  
Now imagine what it will be like once the Semantic Web has properly taken off. Combine ""this is a concert venue"" and ""this is its location"" with ""this is a band"", ""it plays this style"", ""which is a sub-genre of that"" and cross reference it with Google+, Google Maps, Google Music and Google Calendar, and you'll be able to do searches like ""which concerts of bands at least three of my friends who have time that day might like are next week and can be reached by public transport for €30 or less?""

&gt;It is in this context, a Russia that is marginally more integrated into the world economy and that is marginally better positioned diplomatically, that it makes sense to look at the country’s increasingly close relationship with Norway. Throughout the Cold War, Russia and Norway had relations that were, at times, downright nasty. The Soviet-Norwegian border was the site of numerous disturbances, “provocations” as the Russians like to say, there were continuous disputes over fisheries and oil and gas exploration, and even the little matter of a high-ranking Norwegian politician being convicted of high treason for spying on behalf of the Soviet Union. In short: the Russians and Norwegians didn’t agree on much, didn’t work together, and generally kept their distance.
&gt;
&gt;However, over the past several years Russia and Norway have made substantial progress. In 2010 they finally resolved their longstanding maritime boundary dispute with a treaty that was roundly hailed by diplomats as a example that should be followed in subsequent negotiations between countries bordering the Arctic.  By all accounts, the Russians performed ably in these negotiations and were able to reach a win-win deal that didn’t leave any bitter feelings or recriminations in its wake. Russia and Norway, countries with a long history of military confrontation and tension, have even started to conduct regular naval exercises.

Right.

&gt;If you keep trading with them at the same rate you're just encouraging their practices.

No, you're just not allowing their living standards to improve and keeping them in their miserable life for longer. You think their political system will bend over to the EU calls for them to step down? Ah!

If you're really concerned about their conditions, you'll continue working with them while telling them how things are here, it won't be with empty threats and no diplomacy that we'll solve things. Furthermore, once their life quality improves, they'll be on a better situation to change their system, if we don't do business with them, their populace will be the ones who'll suffer the most.

&gt;it's also promoting a stagnation in reformation of the country (as things are getting better and no reason to complain for the population) 

They know how the rest of the world is. They know how things are done in the USA and in the EU or even in South Korea, Japan or Taiwan. They know that their system is oppressive and that it could be much better.

Though they won't be able to change it while they're dependent on their government, let them improve their living standards and let them try to reform it from within. It has already changed a lot in the last few decades and it will continue to change during the years, if we were now to act hostile towards them, we'd be going against the reformation process.

&gt;You know how many jobs would be created in US if they stopped trading as much with China?

This is an argument for protectionism and it's irrational. It's quite like the [candlemaker's petition](http://bastiat.org/en/petition.html) - no, worthwhile jobs won't be created by simply making foreign products more competitive.

&gt;It's killing many jobs and harming economies of countries which,unlike China,are competing on a fair and even level.

If China sells cheap, great, we'll buy from them and specialise on something else. It's the principle of comparative advantages at work.

&gt;The lack of ""competition"" you're referring to comes from the fact that China is playing unfair(lack of environment laws,working conditions,wages,etc.)

That harms them far more than it harms us. They're the ones who have all the costs and we're the ones benefiting from their cheap products.

&gt;If we want to compete with them we have to get down on their level or bring them to our level.

Also the immigration rate is over 500% higher in Norway now than it was in 1990.

Like you say I agree with you on many things, however, there is a big deal breaker when it comes for continious and ever increasing immigration. At some point people will just say flat out ""no!"" to more immigrants regardless of where they come from and who they are.

I believe you can only profit from checking it out. At a certain part in the speech he talks about how children profit from getting stories told in foreign languages and how it's about an actual person telling the stories, just listening to the story on tape had no effect. (Was a UK experiment and babies were told japanese). Can't remember much, but i was blown away.

Edit: I forgot to say another thing.
My mum lived in sweden for several years and said she was so good at pronouncing the words that natives couldn't tell she's from germany. Knowing this i am a little mad at her that she didn't try to teach me swedish when i was a little kid. We used to go to sweden for 1 to 2 months every year so i would have had quite some time to actually use it. So i can just encourage you to teach them because even if you wouldn't regret it some day, mayb your kids will.
