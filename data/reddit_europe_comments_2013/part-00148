&gt; Cars that don't give you priority when you have it... And this is probably universal, so when I think of a bike friendly town, I'm thinking on exclusive bike lanes or streets.

There are lots and lots of separate bike paths, but even when you ride on roads without bike lanes, people are *usually* good about giving you enough room to not feel in danger. There are exceptions, of course.

&gt; How much time do you spend to find where to tie you bike when you actually get to your destination?

A minute or two.

&gt; Do you feel sure you'll find it again 8 hours after?

Yes.  There are only an average of 7 bike thefts reported to the police per day, so I feel fairly confident that mine will not be one of them.

&gt; Can you easily find a shop where to repair/maintain your bike without paying once more its value for tweaking it? Do you have a ""do it yourself"" repair shop nearby?

I have my own ""workshop"" and fix everything myself, but if I needed someone else to do something, there are plenty of good places.  I don't know of a DIY place, though. That would be really nice to have.

&gt; Could everybody at your workplace come by bike (and public transportation), excepting those that physically can't?

Yes, and in summer, many do. My personal route to work is 8km long, with 6 of those being on cycle paths on the sidewalk like [this](http://www.nuernberg.de/imperia/md/nuernberg_steigt_auf/bilder/radwege-bauen_p_wal.jpg).  I much prefer that to cycle paths on the street, although pedestrians can be just as inattentive and nearly as dangerous as auto drivers.

&gt; Can you easily rent a bike for the day/week and at a reasonable price (unlike all rentals in Paris)?

I think when I've rented bikes for visitors, it was €15 per day or so from both places I've rented from.  I don't know if you think that's a reasonable price or not, but I find it perfectly in order.

&gt; Do you have a bike sharing program (like Velib) that covers a lot of ground (unlike Velib)?

Yes, and they have [fairly good coverage](https://www.norisbike.de/de/nuernberg/standorte/). I've never ridden one, but they seem well maintained.",0,1374388175,null,0,false,0,cb72j6x,t3_1imrqj,t1_cb72j6x,t3_1imrqj,null,1430391682,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Now there is a lot to say about banlieues in France, and about the current unrest in Trappes, which are very different from the 2005 riots. In Trappes there is indeed a religious undertone, Trappes is one of the most muslims city of France. But in 2005 there was no religious undertone, yet all the international coverage was about ""muslims riots"". RG, Renseignements Généraux, one of our spy agency (and I must say ruthlessly efficent, they got files on almost every of our public characters) said that, if there were bady guys behind the movement, they were the dealers and criminal leaders (but truth be told, the riots were spontaneous, the dealers were just putting a little more oil on the fire), while radical imams were opposing it, not wanting to call attention on themselves. Most of the rioters caught also had 0 priors. I say that as an introductory warning, you must be cautious of what you read. Especially in that racist cesspoll that is /r/worldnews.

Let me give you a single example of how we approach muslims so wrong in Europe and France in particular. For instance, you will often read that there are 5 millions muslims in France. This figure is obtained by saying that any migrants from a muslim country is muslim, and any child of muslims parents is muslim (no polling done, it's just how the Ministry of Interior does its statistics). You might think that this is not unreasonable, given how religious those countries are.

But when we poll people, we find out that rougly between 1,5 and 2 millions of people say they have a religious islamic practise, and a little over 3 millions practise Ramadan.

So there's two conflicting definition here : a ethnic one, and a religious one, like the jews. In the media however, the evil muslim is someone who wants to impose sharia on Europe and make his wive wear the niqab (which is a very small but alarming minority of the muslims) and yet when numbers are given, it's always the 5 million figure.

It is even more complicated because generally the population we call ""muslims"" in France is mainly from the Maghreb : Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco. And they put their national identity before their religious identity when asked about it. Did I mention that those are ancient colonies, and that we did not always leave on amicable terms ?

The Trappes current events however seem to have a religious undertone. Sadly, we kept bashing muslims in France and after crying wolf for a time, the crisis we wanted to happen happened. The left will probably minimize it, with the exception of Valls, our ministre de l'intérieur who is thinking since two or three years about becoming President in 2017.

What people don't get is that it's the youth that is slowly radicalized, and that there is a bastard culture emerging in the banlieue. In 1990, only 60% of muslims were doing Ramadan, now it's more than 85%. The old guard of Maghreb immigrants that came in 50, 60, 70 wasn't that religious. They wanted to escape poverty, and sometimes the violent islamism in their country (Algeria). They were moderate, or more precisely, as conservative as were the catholic of the times (and French catholics are quite conservative, see the gay rights history in France).

Hughes Lagrange, a french sociologist, found out that :

- Youths are more religious than their elders (which is atypic, when you think about church, you think old people). It's a wide gap : more than 40% of the young muslims go to the Mosque, while less than 20% of the 40 years old do.

- If a muslim came to France while adult, he is more likely to be less religious than a muslim under 16 either immigrating to France, or born here !

([source](http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2012/11/01/des-jeunes-fideles-a-l-islam_1784520_3246.html))

But the thing with those young muslims is that they are mostly French citizens, they're not immigrants. They live here and they aren't leaving.

The true reason behind the rise of Islam in the banlieues is the failure of the State to ""be there"" since more than 40 years now ( and I suppose the post 11 septembre world isn't helping). There is almost no public institutions in those districts, for instance, Clichy-sous-bois, where the 2005 riots started, has no unemployement agency. Despite a +40% unemployemnt in certain districts. I say that because we know from studying cities that crime is a disease, not a weakness of character. If you live in a district that has public services, including transportation, then crime will go down. So when those people feel abandoned, when they feel the public hate, they turn to Islam. And soon there is a sort of islamic pressure installing itself in those banlieues where you got to follow the ""rules"" or else. **Thus ironically, there is no islamic invasion, they're mostly homemade.**

As always, the root of our urban problems is poverty and abandonment.

true,Z3h1rm4hnn,Corse,Corse,"Oula. Bon, je vais vulgariser au minimum alors, histoire que tu comprennes bien le concept, parce que là on parle pas de la même chose.

La ""gender theory"" vient des USA. Ses bases scientifiques datent des années 50 (je pense aux études de John Money) mais, comme souvent, il a fallu attendre une vingtaine d'années pour que ce travail soit exhumé par un courant idéologique (en l'occurrence, les féministes). D'études en études, la littérature scientifique a progressivement intégré la distinction entre sexe (physiologique) et genre (ressenti/social), jusqu'à aboutir à la situation d'aujourd'hui où, que la politique ou la religion le veuillent ou non, l'OMS opère textuellement cette distinction. Quote du site officiel de l'OMS:

""""Sex"" refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women.

""Gender"" refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women.

To put it another way:

""Male"" and ""female"" are sex categories, while ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" are gender categories.""

Fin de citation. Je signale au passage que la Food and Drug Administration opère également cette distinction depuis les années 90.

Bien. En France maintenant. Depuis les années 90, on parle ici de ""théorie du genre,"" avec toute l'ambiguïté qu'offre la traduction grossière de la sémantique anglaise, étant donné que ""theory"" se réfère à la théorie opposée à la pratique et non à la ""théorie"" en tant qu'hypothèse incertaine. Une différence majeure, vois-tu, qui illustre à la perfection toute cette politisation du débat: les gens pensent, par le pouvoir de l'idéologie, être en mesure de contester des faits. Ils extrapolent, appliquent ""théorie du genre,"" une petite expression faite maison, à tout et n'importe quoi. Recherche ça sur Google: les premiers résultats? Des sites militants. C'est symptomatique: on baigne dans le vague, la généralisation, au grand dam des véritables concepts scientifiques.

Pour résumer: la ""théorie du genre"" n'est rien d'autre qu'une mauvaise traduction de la ""gender theory"" américaine, qui ne fait que stipuler que sexe et genre sont deux choses bien différentes, ce qui est aujourd'hui considéré comme un fait par les plus hautes institutions scientifiques mondiales.

Voilà. Je veux pas m'engager dans un débat politique ou idéologique avec toi. J'ai juste essayé de t'expliquer ce qu'il faut vraiment entendre par ""théorie du genre,"" mais si tu veux entendre plus, libre à toi. Simplement, on ne parlera pas de la même chose.

Problematic kids are raised as if they are still living 200 maybe 300 years ago with values and views of a world back then. In their native country they will be corrected on the streets by other parents and maybe an imam telling them to have respect not only for their [grand]parents but also for other peoples stuff. In a western society children learn these values at home. We don't have a correctional society any more.   
Then there's the language barrier, being raised in a family where dad brings home a tiny salary because he's working a job that doesn't involve language that much. A dad that treats his wife in a way the Western world frowns upon.

I can fucking tell you this much: when I was their age I would have fucking killed to go to this school instead of the 100% pure white hellhole of a school that I went to. This ""immigrant"" school I work at is so much more peaceful and so much better than my school ever was.

So serious in fact that several kids (victims, mind you, not perpetrators!) had to change schools or risk bodily harm during the break periods. There was statistics that I got to see a few years after the fact, and my school had the highest percentage of kids that were drinking, smoking and having sex of any school in the country my graduating year. About 90% of the kids were habitually drinking during the weekends (and the *oldest* of those kids would have been 14 or 15). The turnover rate for teachers was of course unreal and staggering. At least once a week there'd be cops around looking for some kid (though why they bothered I'm not sure: most students didn't show up for most classes anyway). I'm not even sure how we got any education at all given the circumstances.

Anyway, there were *no* immigrants in my school. None whatsoever. It was a white pride paradise, and it was hell on earth. By comparison my 90% immigrants work place is like Harvard.

Europe needed a millennium to free itself from the last religious craze and lost tens of millions in a conflict provoked by an extremist ideology less than a century ago. So it's not surprising that today, when finally  these ideas seemed to belong in the past, Europe is circumspect in welcoming another extreme religious ideology.

Of course, Islam is not singular. All monotheistic religions, by their fundamental idea that ""only *my* God is real"", are intolerant. But Islam refined this and brought it to a new level. It's no coincidence that the very first act of the converted Arabs was to start a ""holy"" war, a Jihad, and put to the sword half of the then-known world.

Also, in Europe at least, the other major monotheism, Christianity, has lost much of its influence. So, is it so surprising that the argument goes like this: ""Have we struggled against Christian fanatism only to be overwhelmed by Muslim fanatism?""

On the other hand, what Europe dislikes it's the reaction brought by the introduction of this ferment in the mixture. Dormant ideologies, like fascism or racism, caught on the opportunity to reclaim anew their relevance.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;Are you talking about America and the effect European settlers had on the native population? It's not even about immigration really, it's about vast culture differences.

What is perceived as ""vast cultural differences"". one hundred years ago the Anglo-Saxon Protestants were scared of Catholic immigration (Irish, German, Italian), seing it as incompatible with local democratic culture.

&gt;What about the Roman Empire? Multiculturalism and vast expansion was the death of it. 

Vast expansion, yes. ""Multiculturalism"" I highly doubt it. This is a really simplistic way of looking at things.

&gt;People self segregate for a reason. They like being with **people like them**.

„Like them” does not necessarily mean „the same culture as them” or „the same race as them”. Culture varies a lot vertically as well in a society. 

How one defines the „us” and the „them” can be on numerous arbitrary things. To an outsider, there are little differences between a Serb and a Croat. To a Croat, it's not unlikely to not view Serbs as „people like them”. Or „Muslim Indians” vs „Pakistanis”. I'm sure a lot of Brits consider Black Londoners closer to themselves culturally than a White Romanian villager.

&gt;The reasons their country is a third world toilet are brought with them, and you're making a huge mistake if you think they won't do that to the host country.

Crime is rampant, people treat this place like a dump, setting fires, vandalize, throw garbage. Bored boys are everywhere, girls are only seen carrying groceries or taking care of children.

Plenty are muslim all the way, but a lot others are only when it fits their agenda. They can smoke and drink, but cant accept a job where alcohol, pork or servicing women is part of it, or let their women/girls out the house. The big crime clans running the place are Palestinian ""muslims"", all members on welfare or disability.

Some say its the media giving this place a bad name, but I live here, a lot of issues goes unreported. The media is effectively giving this place a pass, so is the police.

We are told we need all the immigrants we can get to make up for lack of native births, but the MENA groups tops every chart of unemployment, disability pay, welfare, crime, illiteracy... Good luck getting them into the workforce in a country where education is key and government checks will equal or beat minimum wage.

When I read posts in r/Europe, I cant help but wonder if they are written by people like young me, who thinks culture means very little, all people are the same deep down, and if they aren't interested in joining our society, why would they come here? Now I see a very different picture.

When North Americans try to compare their muslims/MENA to ours, what they don't get is that we take the ones they don't let in. We take the ones unfit for our society and then pay their ways. In the US, they would live on the street, if they even got past customs.

I could write more, but frankly I'm getting depressed.

Also I don't agree when you talk about the ""failure of the state to be here"". Do you have specific informations to backup that, or do you rely on the cliches the medias are often promoting? From my experience, I found that the state is actually present in the poor suburbs. A city like Trappes does have a lot of state-run infrastructures. My impression is that many cities of the poor suburbs get a lot of equipment (social centers, ""priority education areas"", unemployment agencies, etc...) and that the myth of the failed state in some banlieues... is a myth. 

The problem is elsewhere, in the perception the rest of the population have of them, and that is promoted by a terrible tradition of lazy journalism we have in France. And a terribly unprofessional police, who rely on intimidation : french police is fond of identity checks and doesn't have to justify them. This leed to a massive trend to control people of arab/african descent. There is no way to investigate on this because the statistic of identity checks are kept secrets by law. 


Another sign of the un-professionality of our police: the fact that its procedure of investigation rely heavily on the ""garde à vue"" (keeping in custody) and on the intimidations they generate. By law, the person kept in custody can keep silent. After some political debates, the police has no obligation to notify the person that it can remain silent, because it would fuck the core of their job.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;Is Communist-bashing different from Muslim-bashing?

In the context of the current discussion, it is different. Unlike Muslims, Communists are not disproportionately found in an immigrant population of different race. Muslim-bashing has been used as a proxy for different-race-bashing. 

That notwithstanding, religious identities and political options are most of the time treated differently by individuals who hold them. Political identities are something that people only start thinking about in their teens, while religious identities are usually formed in the family from an early age. It's more central to the core identity of an individual. That's why we view them as not quite the same. I don't know of many people who were ""raised Communist"" or ""raised Liberal"", but do know of lots of ""raised [Religion X]"".

Also a thing I should note, if we're making parallels, is that Muslim bashing is simmilar to Leftis-Bashing or Rightist-Bashing. Calling all Muslims ""fundametalist"", which a lot of people seem to equate, is like calling all leftists ""Communists"" or all rightists ""Fascists"".

&gt;So if I'm allowed to go out and insult Communists publicly, I don't see why I shouldn't be able to do so with Muslims.

In theory, I agree.

L'état actuel pitoyable dans lequel se trouve ce domaine est uniquement le fruit de ce qu'il recèle profondément : Un projet qui a l'apparence du scientifique mais dont le but n'est pas la science, c'est à dire l'explication du monde. Ce n'est qu'une redite moderne des projets du début du 20e, qui tentaient de démontrer le bien-fondé de l'eugénisme ou que les Allemands étaient des vicieux par nature comme le prouve leur amour de la choucroute.. 

Bref, en plus d'être des suiveurs de toutes les études et recherches sur le déterminisme social, leur travail est méticuleusement anéanti par l'idéologie qui en suinte. Les êtres humains ne sont pas que le genre qu'ils ont. 

De plus, si tu avais une once d'impartialité, tu aurais toi-même l'explication des raisons qui font que cette tradition ""scientifique"" n'existe qu'aux Etats-Unis, malgré les auteurs prolifiques sur le sujet qu'on peut avoir ailleurs, en France par exemple. La raison en est simple et elle est identique à celle qui explique les querelles stériles sur le scepticisme climatique. Les US sont une nation de religion et ils ont besoin d'une nouvelle religion moderne pour permettre aux politiciens d'agir. Le gender studies est un des exemples d'instrumentalisation de la science.

Si le gender studies ne peut même pas vivre cette distinction, c'est bien qu'il n'a que peu de cohérence. C'est encore un moyen pour les adeptes de cette idéologie de se dédouaner des lacunes intellectuelles, scientifiques et philosophiques de leur ""dada"", voire mieux de se transformer en victime du système, position qui convient très bien à des féministes chevronnées.

You have to make an argument before it's anything other than pure pointless insults. Many people here would think insults are just as legitimate as insults or claiming various evil things but it's absolutely not. 

The second distinction is between the type of people who believe in both sets of ideas. The problem with a lot of the 'criticism' of Islam is that it's often (but not always) people using the reasonable idea of criticising religion, which they are entitled to do, and using it as a way to hide the fact that they just want to get away with saying racist things. People will often have more of a problem with people criticising Islam because there is a large minority of people (including Marie Le Pen or the EDL here) who think of Islam etc not in terms of religion but in national terms - Marie Le Pen claiming seeing someone pray on the streets was the same as nazi occupation. That's at political, national, quite secular thing to say but comparing it to an occupation. She's not saying we need to work very hard to stop radicalisation like the top commenter ATM is saying she's saying their presence is itself the problem. The EDL equally say things like they opposed 'the islamification of Europe' and yet nothing they do is aimed at opposing islam's influence but only at anti-immigration stuff. Again it's not the subtle influence of religion they are worried about it's the very presence of foreign people that they oppose. That's racist but they try to hide behind criticism of Islam. That in tern discredits anyone who wishes to criticise Islam properly. That's why people get a bit more anxious about it - it's normally a lie that even the racist can't see through.

What is now the European Union was founded as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 whose members were France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. It was created to tie the heavy industry of those countries together so that it would be economically infeasible for them to declare war on each other as coal and steel were two of the primary raw materials needed to build weapons of war - As the French foreign minister Robert Schuman said at the time: to ""make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible"".

You also shouldn't forget that Greece, Spain and Portugal were dictatorships until the mid 70s, they joined the then European Communities (the ECSC, the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Economic Community) in 1981 (Greece) and 1986 (Spain and Portugal).

Then there's the Eastern enlargement; after the end of the Cold War and the fall of the iron curtain, there was a lot of political instability and the accession process has lead to a significant stabilisation of Eastern Europe, with reforms to the rule of law, human rights, and market economies.

Lastly, there was war in Europe following the collapse of Yugoslavia until as recently as 1995 - less than 20 years ago. Just this month, one of the countries involved (Croatia) acceded to the EU and became the 28th member state.

So although the EU is probably not stopping the UK and other European nations from descending into war, it is stabilising our neighbourhood - and the UK was (and AFAIK, still is) one of the countries pushing for enlargement to the East. That's good for our safety, the safety of our allies and our economic well-being.

&gt;What a do hear that does impact us are the silly rules they make us follow which can't be the same for every country as every country is different, green taxes and other stuff, energy costs

There are different types of EU secondary legislation (e.g. directives and regulations, to name two). Directives are *much* more flexible than other forms of EU legislation as they have to be transposed into national law (i.e. for a directive to have affect the UK must pass an Act of Parliament) - this allows for European law to be implemented in a way that's broadly compatible with local legal and societal customs. Regulations, on the other hand, apply directly to every member state without having to be transposed into national law. A good example is the current proposed General Data Protection Regulation which is being developed at the moment to replace the older Data protection Directive. This is the law that gives you many of your privacy rights. Having exactly the same law across all of the EU means that it doesn't matter which company processes your data (as *any* European company can do business in *any* EU member state without discrimination) you'll have the same level of protection.

&gt;also dumb shit like bananas must be x long and x curved or they're binned, same for potato sizes and other produce which costs our farmers millions (They're super market standards not market ofc).

And that's all complete nonsense. For a start, there's no regulation banning bananas that aren't long enough or curved enough. What there is is a grading system. Next tie you're in a supermarket, look at the labels on produce and you'll see ""Class I"" or ""Class II"" etc. These rules are about what can be classified in which class to give consumers guarantees about quality, but there's *absolutely nothing* stopping anybody from selling any shape fruit or veg.

Secondly, these are rules that pre-date the European rules you're talking about, and are more about harmonising the *existing* rules across all of the EU's member states so that instead of classifying produce to 28 different sets of rules you only have to do it *once*, and that allows you to sell your produce *anywhere* within the EU without any additional regulatory burden.

People who complain about things like that are, quite frankly, stupid. They're ostensibly complaining about red tape but don't realise that the regulations *remove* red tape.

&gt;Also we don't even use the Euro and the Pound is and always has been strong, I've never really felt part of the EU, other than geographically.

Btw - I have never said that  I refuse to spend money on the EU. I am saying that I want to know where the EU is going, and what they are planning when they take in more and more members. Furthermore, I'd like to know there plans for finances and projects. Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland has been receiving money since 1986 (not to mentions some areas in Italy and France that has been receiving mony since the 70's). Isn't it perfectly reasonable to have a plan for when Spain for example should be a net donor? I mean, we do have a plan for all those money they have been given over the years - don't we? 

Furthermore, if we have projects like ""rural development"" for example, I'd like for that project (like any projects) to have a start, goal, end - and evaulation. So, what do they want/goal, for how long- and did we reach it. 

Obviously we haven't reached it in some areas, since Italy and France have areas that has been on the receiving end of that since the 70's. 4 decades of receiving money - and no evaluation of why they haven't developed?

Atheists will criticise the religion and it's influence on society while people on here or in /r/worldnews criticise the people who believe it often simple because of their foreignness. Your right in that it's fine for people to exercise their free speech to insult someone though it's perhaps not the most helpful thing to do but there is a line between insults and things like inciting racial hatred or like being anti-immigration for no other reason than dislike of foreign people. It's a fine line but what annoys me is people who cross that line and are openly racist but claim they are just criticising or just encouraging a discussion.

true,spinasatapom,GERM,"Alas, Europe... (FRG)","Look, with muslims the problem is that they are mostly migrants. In German Politics, when you want to make a racist comment about the Turkish, you rather talk about muslims. It's easier. On another level, there is the narrative that we live in a christian-jewish culture, which is, of course, bullshit, since many countries only exist because they went *against* religion and a lot of the cultural canon we only knew due to the arabic tradition (e.g. large parts of Aristotle). So this fuels anti-muslim hatred and seems to allow for a rational discrimination against them. 

And while all this prejudices exist, migrants often live in really shitty condition. There are studies that show that if you have a typical German surname you are prefered to someone who has a Arabic or Turkish surname, even if their grades are better. Combined with the heavily selective school system, this leads often to a certain segregation of migrants, who are often muslim. There is a saying: ""Class matters more than culture"", which means that the economic status of a person is much more important than their cultural background. If you are cut off of even the silly live capitalism allows, e.g. a job with a salary which allows a decent living, what do you want to do? 

So, yeah. There might be a problem with muslims. But to a large degree it's been made by the majority of society. ""Religion"" is often a wrapper, that is used to veil the real problems and which allow an easy media narrative. On another level there is also a certain problematic element in some muslim traditions (e.g. the sharia) -- but I really don't see it a) being supported by the majority of muslims (quite the contrary) b) any real problem that is a political topic in any proper sense, so I think that c) the perspective I described above is much more accurate to the situation. And it's anyway something you need to think about before raising the other questions, as it shows that oneself is often deeply involved in producing the muslim stereotype, one later criticises.

How would you suggest the police deal with a peaceful protest with a small number of thugs who use the opportunity to loot and vandalism? They would be crucified by the press if they did nothing, but as soon as they try to stop the trouble, they are accused of violence. It is a no win situation. 

You cannot send officers to police a large crowd without some sort of protection. PC Keith Blakelock was hacked to death with a machete after getting separated in the Broadwater farm riots. While a riot is obviously different to a protest, the idea of defenseless police officers is not a good one. Generally, if you look at most protests, you will see regular officers in uniform escorting the crowd. It is after the situation escalates that the shields and helmets come out.

2011 was a shambles partly because the police were scared after the backlash they received from 2010 (where they *were* in the wrong). They are dammed if they do and dammed if they don't.

As for the idea that the police start violence, I don't think ketteling helps. But it is probably more tit for tat. ie, a protester gets too close to the police line, the officer is threatened and pushes then back into the crowd. The crowd push back at the police who attempt to keep the line together by using batons to drive the crowd back. The crowd sees this as violence and starts throwing things in retaliation. That is how these riots start. A misunderstanding on both sides. When the relationship between the protesters and the police is amicable, you never see violence on either side. The anti gay marriage protests and the counter protests were kept apart by a line of police, and despite the strong feelings on each side, there was no violence from the crowd or the police.",0,1374412695,null,0,false,0,cb75yvt,t3_1iovr1,t1_cb75yvt,t1_cb75nux,null,1430390063,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

* We imported £87.7bn worth of goods from the EU, compared to £80.3bn from non EU states. This means we import more than half our goods within the EU.

So, let's say we left the EU. We cannot guarantee we would get free trade on the same levels, meaning we would have to pay more for the goods we import and export. This would discourage companies from opening factories here, as they would have to pay more for EU trade (for example, these Japanese car companies like Nissan and Honda export a lot of cars from British factories to the EU, due to free trade, which would be more expensive if we left the EU), losing jobs within Britain, as these companies would move their factories to within the bigger free market, the EU. It would also mean that we would have to pay more for our goods, making us less well off.

This process was already beginning to occur during the Cold War as a response to the pressures of globalization and sociopolitical pressures placed on Middle Eastern states during the time. However, I would say that the major turning point for Islamic fundamentalism was the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and later the Soviet war in Afghanistan. In both cases, Islamist factions achieved victory over what was perceived as ""western"" (or at the very least non-Muslim) powers.

Islamic fundamentalism is not incredibly different from any other religious fundamentalism. It tends to take root among individuals who feel cut-off from society at large and occur when there is a perceived threat to the integrity or survival of the religion or its followers. In the case of Islamic fundamentalism, these pressures have been building since American and Soviet interference in the Middle East and Central Asia during the Cold War and have only escalated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

And even naming The Pope as some kind of all-ruling judicial entity is above absurd. Contrary to the muslim leaders and Ayatollahs, who repeatedly issued death warrants for various controversial figures [Salman Rushdie] (http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-khomeini.html), [Lars Vilks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Vilks_Muhammad_drawings_controversy) etc. and the death of jews worldwide, The Pope has never in modern times condoned violence against any societal group of people or personas. On the contrary, ever since John Paul II every papal figure has promoted peace and brotherhood with all religions.  I can't remember any influential muslim leader who has done the same, maybe you can remind me and call me an imbecille again.

The Crusades were a natural reaction to the threat that was Islam throughout the early 7th century until the middle ages. And keep in mind, where did the crusade take place? It was centered around present-day Israel/Palestine since the origin of the Christian faith is places in that region, while the Muslim conquest which lasted near a thousand years was a deliberate plan to claim previously unknown territory in order to grow as a religion. The Reconquista was also a reaction to the Islamic conquest of Spain centuries before.

So, even though we've come to understand that the Islamic empires were the aggressors against Europe, you're fine by saying ""the Europeans were busy fighting a pointless wars and petty conflicts"". They didn't declare wars, they were defending their territory and defending their faith.

And this wonderful and golden age of science which flourished due to the genious of the muslim caliphates - where is that knowledge today? By some mysterious reason, this knowledge and wisdow is seldom seen as a trademark of the muslim community, whereas the the western civilization was always in the forefront in every aspect of the term.

true,potpan0,null,null,"&gt;That's not true, I don't think many people want to leave the EU purely for economic reasons but trying to suggest that it's not a consideration is simply disingenuous.

Perhaps I should have been clearer. People do bring up economic reasons, like the £50m per day and that, but I think it is mainly due to social and political ones. If I went up to someone and asked for the main reason why they wanted to leave the EU, it would likely be because 'Brussels are imposing their laws on us', or 'foreigners are taking our jobs', or something along those lines.

&gt;I think the larger point is that he wants more trade with the world, capitalising on emerging markets and he views the EU trade restrictions as stifling.

Why can't we have both? What a lot of EU regulations stop is either tax breaks on businesses we compete with within the EU (like on video games, although I agree that was stupid), or removing workers rights. We will never be able to compete with countries like China or India on unskilled labour, which means we have to go into more specialised labour (like high level engineering and stuff), which tax breaks wouldn't really help.

&gt;I mean that's a very pointed and weighted paragraph. It's much wider than you suggest though, many people in the UK do have a problem with so many of our laws being made elsewhere, the ECHR interfering in a lot of domestic issues and the resulting eroding of our sovereignty.

Here are the cases of ECHR cases involving the UK in 2013:

* **Eweida v British Airways** : Nadia Eweida wanted to wear a cross necklace openly at work to show her Christianity as a BA baggage handler, but BA wouldn't allow it. She believed it was religious discrimination, but BA/Court of Appeal did not accept that. She went to the ECHR, who said her rights had been violated under Article 9 of the ECHR, and she got her awarded damages. I remember at the time the media, especially papers like the Daily Mail (who normally hate the EU), got in a tizzy over the law being anti-Christian. I bet they rarely mention that the ECHR actually upheld her rights.

* **Betteridge v United Kingdom**: Betteridge, a convicted rapist, had his parole meeting unlawfully held back. The media spun this as 'Rapist allowed freedom by ECHR' or something, but if a certain date for parole is agreed, it shouldn't be kept back.

There are many more, but I've literally spent the last half an hour reading through law speak on the ECHR website, so I'm a bit blown out. Sorry about that.

&gt;We're not having a referendum though, the Tories getting an absolute majority at the next election is the least likely potential outcome by a long chalk.

The thing is, the way the Tories have talked it up, they have spread the idea that the people deserve a vote on the EU now. Any party who does not offer this will get a slaughtering from the papers and the public, and everyone who wants out of the EU will be pissed off, and some who want to have the choice anyway will also be annoyed. 

&gt;So whilst you're right that UKIP is the catalyst, the real reason we need a referendum is because the public deserve a choice on something that is so much in their consciousness, and that affects their every day lives. And quite frankly you should advocate for one whichever side of the debate you're on, if you believe in democracy.

You have already been given links by a few people in this thread, to documents that would be a good starting point to finding out where your money is going and what they're planning to do with it. The EU is very transparent with regards to how it spends the taxpayer's money so you can always find this out by your own research. And there are other NGOs that specifically look at the money being spent and highlight those that are wasteful. I can remember, for example, that one such organisation discovered 500 euros being spent on drinks for no apparent reason. Yes there are billions being wasted for example on Sicilian railroads, but even small amounts are noted. My point is, the information is there, you just have to look for it.

But I don't think you really want to look for the information and instead you just want to argue with people here. Unless someone on this forum is a professional EU budget controller, I don't think you will get a good answer to your question ie. you're wasting your time.

I personally think that the EU's budget is too complicated for you to get single-sentence answers or even single-page answers. Why is it good that Greece is getting more money that it gives to the common budget? Perhaps because the fact that the EU won't let one of its members fail gives reassurance to investors who won't take their money someplace else. The improved infrastructure in Spain allows Spanish fruit to be delivered to your Swedish supermarket at a much reduced cost compared to 30 years ago. If you ask your parents or grandparents they will probably think of a few fruits and vegetables that didn't exist (in Sweden) when they were young. Now you have that, and you get a more diverse diet = healthier = you live longer.

There are many other reasons I could think of, like being poor increases the chance of being a failed state which increases the change of war which negatively affects the whole continent in more ways than just economically, so it pays off to keep everyone happy. Since Spanish, Greek people have a relatively similar standard of living and education to Swedes, they are free to move to Sweden and work on some highly profitable ventures (like the spallation source in Lund funded by the EU), while had they been living a 3rd world lifestyle they probably would've struggled to learn how to use escalators let alone learn nuclear physics. The question you're really asking is when will there be a date when all of this will end.

Because lets face it, the reason why we don't have fiscal or banking union is because politicians want to have freedom to do what ever they want, taking this freedom out of there hands is very hard, and if we now set up a system that lifts responsibility but not freedom to act from politicians, they won't give this up until they have created a systematic crisis than can break up the whole European/global economy.

Concerning poverty in the banlieues, while I don't know the details about Trappes (it's one of the poorest cities of France, but the departement Yvelines have invested some money in Z.A.I. which probably makes its city finances healthier), I would advise to look at Seine-Saint-Denis.

While in theory ZEP should have more money, in practise they have less experienced teachers (sometimes uncertified ones !), they quit more easily, and there are some substitutes teachers positions that aren't filled. So even if the department of Education [brags](http://www.dsden93.ac-creteil.fr/spip/spip.php?article99) about how there are more hours per student in Seine Saint Denis than the national average (slighty more), because there are comparatively less available people to teach them, because they are also less experimented, the truth is [the opposite](http://www.lemonde.fr/ecole-primaire-et-secondaire/article/2013/04/17/exasperes-des-classes-sans-maitres-les-parents-occupent-des-ecoles-de-seine-saint-denis_3161064_1473688.html). See also [this article](http://www.rue89.com/2012/09/22/penurie-de-profs-dans-le-93-une-situation-bientot-explosive-235544). The problem is mostly in primary schools, which is stupidly criminal, because it's the most important public schools of our mandatory system.

After all, pardon my french, the departement of Seine Saint Denis is a shithole, and teachers aren't interested to work there. The same phenomenon happen to doctors, it has long been said that countryside was a medical desert, but it's now the banlieues which has the worst generalist,nurses,specialists per capita rate. The banlieues are deserted by the doctors. (Source : [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2012/06/04/sante-les-maires-des-quartiers-populaires-sonnent-alarme_n_1567467.html), [2](http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/en-seine-saint-denis-le-desert-medical-avance-27-03-2011-1311821_23.php).

As you can understand now, there is a vicious circle. It's a shithole, thus the very people who would be able to change it don't come, thus it stays a shithole or even worsen. Worst, any effort will be met with hostility : a new bus line in a poor district with high crime rate might be met with violence against the bus drivers.

Another example, it is well known that in certain areas, firemen and ambulance don't go in alone, because they are going to be targetted by stones. Which de facto creates a situation of abandonment. And even if it's 1,5,10% of the population that is responsible for this, what about the 90% other ? They deserve the help of the State, and the State failed them, even going as low as making promises and not holding them (last time it happened : 2007 presidential elections). Since more than 40 years.

Now, I've only covered Education and Health (and Money a bit too with Gatignan), there is also the iconic case of Clichy-sous-bois where the 2005 riots started, which do not have [any unemployment agency](http://www.senat.fr/questions/base/2012/qSEQ12110220S.html), but you can easily find out how Public Transportations are a problem too.

In general, because the various state institutions thate have money are concerned with wealth creations, they make investement in the wealthiest areas, the ones where there is no risk (only exception in France : Corse, where the State pay so much for so little).",0,1374417254,null,0,false,0,cb76tmf,t3_1iqo6v,t1_cb76tmf,t1_cb75e3n,null,1430389590,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

What this means, and what hasn't happened yet, but will happen, is that for example a Latvian bank could expand and open up branches all around Europe, take new customers, make new loans, etc.. And it still would be Latvian bank with Latvian bank authorities and regulators taking care of it, paying its money to Latvian state. During expansion, during good times, this bank could easily become one of the biggest banks in Europe having trillions after trillions of assets. There is nothing currently that could stop this, nothing...

Well, you of course would say that local regulators wouldn't allow this, but...

* Have you asked where were the Cypriot regulators when Greek state made their debt restructuring? Because the Cypriot banks went bust, because they had invested into Greek bonds, but it took a whole year, before they went bust. Essentially meaning that the Cypriot regulators and politicians closed their eyes, and pretended that their banks weren't bankrupt even when they were. So essentially this means that whole states and collide to commit a fraud to benefit their own interests, because they are all in bed with one and another.
* Another thing to note is that when a bank is a smaller than the country it operates, the country can handle its risks. But when a bank is larger than its home country, when for example its Europe wide, then the risks that it creates are systematic: if European tax payers won't bailout the bank, then it will crash the whole European economy, thus the whole crisis created by one member states is not anymore its responsibility.

The only way you can circumnavigate all these problems that arise from local politicians and local banks being in bed with another, is to lift up financial benefits from member states. If member states don't anymore benefit from windfall tax revenue caused by their banks, then they don't any impetus to close their eyes or allow riskier operation procedures.

Yes, but no one has been able to tell me for example what I want to know. I have looked - honest- You tell me then. For starters

**For how long are we going to give rural development aid to individual areas? 

** Have we evaluated the rural development aid? For many more years are Italy going to receive it?

**When are Spain, Greece, Portugal, Ireland etc going to be net donors, not recipients.

You honestly seem to be baffled over the fact that I want to know the *plans* for the money, and the evaluation, and the goals. How is that weird? I don't think it is a good policy not to tell me that. If the EU is so transparent- why can't I found that one out. It is all very reasonable questions. Do you honestly support a government that can't answer that? I don't - if my government can answer that, why can't the EU? 


&gt;But I don't think you really want to look for the information and instead you just want to argue with people here. Unless someone on this forum is a professional EU budget controller, I don't think you will get a good answer to your question ie. you're wasting your time.

Fun fact - I have spoken to professional EU budget controller (several times actually for different reasons) , at their office in Sweden. All they can tell me is that ""we gave money X to project Y, and they spent it on Y"". No one can tell me whether Y was a good project, and no one is evaluating it.

Give me a link then.  Give me one reason why the EU can't tell me + why they haven't evaluated. Shouldn't they evaluate not just where the money has gone *but if it is effective too*. 

Personally, the Spanish oranges might be to expensive now anyway + the Spanish climate will be fucked up because of climate change so I think it very well could have been smarter to invest in infrastructure (at least they go under infrastucture in Sweden) with regards to Internet, etc. I think it might have helped in the downturn the Spanish economy has taken too.

If you or I are right, I will never now- *because the EU haven't set a goal, nor have they evaluated*. And you are perfectly fine with having sent away billions with no goal. I am not. That you are scares me.

**May I ask, and I really like for you to answer this - what do you have against goal, planning and evaluation?** Give me several good reason why the EU should not have plans, set goals and the evaluate the result. Why do you dislike it? I think it would be a lot better if we had it.** 


&gt;The question you're really asking is when will there be a date when all of this will end. In my opinion it should never end, poor countries should always receive money from rich countries in order to balance the world out and make everyone more equal. There is direct and indirect benefit for all parties, this is not a zero-sum game.

But you are accepting a status quo - Spain is always poor, and should always be on the receiving end, so Igelkotten, stop complaining you are rich"". 

This is wrong on so many levels, First - I do not, unlike you accept this status quo. I think Spain could become rich, and I do not, unlike you, accept that Italian rural development should be given to the same areas for 40 + years since I happen to think they could develop. 

In the same time south Korea has gone from poor to rich, southern Italy hasn't developed. I think that is wrong, and that we should change that. I think we should set goals, ask what went wrong (evaluate) and have a time frame. 

Same for Spain/Greece/Portugal. I do not think it is a given that  they should be poor forever, but we need to look at what they have been given, perhaps the amounts should stay the same, but the aid should be given completely differently, to help growth etc. 

However, we will never know, because the EU refuse to say any goal, set any goal, plan and evaluate. And people like you support that  (really, *why*) and complain when I want to change it. 

Furthermore, another complain I have at your point of view is that it make areas victims + make them passive. Really, if rural Italy know that they will be given development money, no matter what, why should they develop? They might even loose the money. So, instead they make sure that they don't. That is why one should have a time frame, and evaluation - something the EU hasn't and you apparently do not want either. Tell me then - for how many decades should rural areas in Italy receive development money? They have for 40 years - another 40? 100? Btw - this is a common phenomenon in aid to thirld world. 

What is more is that for example Greece know that the EU will pay for their roads, they will not bother to budget for it  - who cares, the roads will be built anyway.

I think all of the situations outlined are wrong - I think we can change that. But to do that we need goals, planning, evaluation and a willingness to say ""This isn't working, stop it"". 

I think it is frighetning that you are against all that but I am really looking forward to read your answers as to why.

&gt;On the contrary, ever since John Paul II every papal figure has promoted peace and brotherhood with all religions. I can't remember any influential muslim leader who has done the same, maybe you can remind me and call me an imbecille again. 

The Ottomans were renowed for their religious tolerance at a time when Europe was busy devastating itself because of religion.

As for modern times:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Islam

&gt;The Crusades were a natural reaction to the threat that was Islam throughout the early 7th century until the middle ages. And keep in mind, where did the crusade take place? It was centered around present-day Israel/Palestine since the origin of the Christian faith is places in that region, while the Muslim conquest which lasted near a thousand years was a deliberate plan to claim previously unknown territory in order to grow as a religion. 

Oh you mean like the Livonian Crusades? The Reconquista? The numerous attempts to convert the Native Americans? The absolutely brutal way heresy was stamped out?

&gt;The Reconquista was also a reaction to the Islamic conquest of Spain centuries before.

Did Iberia rightfully belong to the Visigoth's? What about the Romans? The fact of the matter is, both the Romans and the Visigoth's imposed their will through conquest, same as the Muslims. Incidentally, Muslim society was much more cosmopolitan and tolerant as opposed to the subsequent Spanish and Aragonese kingdom which imposed Christianity on the general populace by force and killed/expelled those who did not convert. 

&gt;So, even though we've come to understand that the Islamic empires were the aggressors against Europe, you're fine by saying ""the Europeans were busy fighting a pointless wars and petty conflicts"". 

Bullshit. The Islamic Empires were doing what every single Empire before them had done. If you want to claim that Europe was simply defending its territory and faith when it fought against the Muslims well then, the same argument can be made about the Muslims fighting against the Franks during the Crusades. The Levant was not originally Christian and neither did it belong to the Rome until it took it by force. So, using this logic, the Muslim conquest was actually a reconquest. 

&gt;And this wonderful and golden age of science which flourished due to the genious of the muslim caliphates - where is that knowledge today? By some mysterious reason, this knowledge and wisdow is seldom seen as a trademark of the muslim community, whereas the the western civilization was always in the forefront in every aspect of the term.

Oh definitely, like when a bunch of Europeans decided the Jews were annoying and tried to kill them all. Or when France was plunged into a forty year civil war between different religious factions where massacres were as common as taking a piss in the morning. Nevermind the crusades against the heathens or the numerous other bullshit things Europeans did because of religion. 

The fact of the matter is, up until Europeans started to colonise the Americas they were irrelevant. Europe was a speck on the map of the world that didn't contribute anything meaningful to it and spent most of its time warring with itself. Even then, up until the Industrial Revolution most of the advances in philosophy and science was done either in the Muslim World or in China. The Industrial Revolution itself was only made possible because of the discovery of the Steam Engine by the Chinese. 

&gt;And as a last note, please elaborate what you mean with your last sentence, the one about how the Muslim world was above Europe for a thousand years? You don't need to explain what imbecille means, but feel free to insult me again when your arguments weaken.

I would warn against the simplicity of seeing 9/11 as the sole reason, worldwide islamism is older than 9/11 (after all, 9/11 happened *because* of it), by a few decades at least (France suffered a series of Islamists bomb attacks in 1995 for instance). It's just that 2001 marks a shift in the way we perceive Islam and view muslims. (I think [the answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1iqo6v/are_muslims_in_europe_really_this_problematic_or/cb76ird) given by c_freuen is spot on.)

And while the fire that seems to be burning worldwide seem the same everywhere, the accelerants that were used to start them are quite different locally : you won't deny that the history of Islam in Kosovo is relevant to what is happening in your country. In the same way, France history with Islam is complicated (involving notably the colonial War with Algeria) and can't be dismissed.

My personal opinion is that it's a bit like [1968](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_of_1968) : a lot of revolutions happened at the same time but for various reasons and with various outcomes, though with a sort of common motivation. It's both a global phenomenon and many local specific events whose root causes are barely related.
I guess the same is true about Islamism today. 

In the same fashion, muslims of France, muslims of Kosovo, muslims of Indonesia, muslims of Canada, etc. have not that much to do with each other. In fact, in the first place, putting them under the same label, treating them with hostility, might be one of the main reason they feel threatened and rejected, thus clinging to radicalization. This a classic story of the youth, told too many times : when you're rejected, you are more easily seduced by extremism (drugs, politics, religion, etc.).

There used to be a time where the muslim living in the US, in India or even Iran, etc., wasn't all that concerned with what his arab brethen, often of another sect, was doing in the Middle East.

I'm not saying we shouldn't work to improve our police, or that we shouldn't try harder to find those doing wrong, I'm just saying that no force is perfect and never will be.

No matter where you are, nearly every protest will have a police presence. This doers not necessarily mean hundreds of officers in riot gear. It might just be a few bobbies keeping an eye on things from a distance. This does not mean they expect trouble or law breaking, however the police would be very naive not to keep an eye on things, even if just from a public safety point of view.

The fact is that unless they are ketteling or being abusive, the mere presence of police should not be an escalator for trouble. Many protesters seem to forget that the police are not the government, and are simply enforcing the law. The also forget that the officer in front of them could actually agree with their cause and would rather be marching with them. The fact is, if you treat the police like the enemy, they will become the enemy even if they were being respectful before.

As for the riots, the officers did what they could. We all saw the pictures of two or three riot trained officers trying to protect a street from around 100 rioters... The fact is that numbers were a limiting factor, and the abuse and criticism they would have received had they tried to make up for this by using NI style tactics of teargas and water cannon would have been huge.

In the Spanish-speaking world however, the difference is more clear, I think.

In **Spain**, people from Hispanic America (i.e. all countries in the Americas that have Spanish as their main language) are called normally (and correctly) *hispanoamericanos* (Hispanic Americans). *Sudamericanos* (South Americans) is also used as a generalisation to all Hispanic Americans, using your words, by some uneducated circles (calling Mexicans or Dominicans South Americans, when they're not). 

""*Latinos*"" (an abbreviation of *latinoamericanos*, which means ""Latin Americans"") has a specal situation. Normally, Spaniards will not call them 'latinos', because as it has been said by others here, the Latins are considered to be the ancient Latin-speakers. As a result, ""hispanoamericanos"" is always prefered. However, the Hispanic Americans almost always call themselves *latinos*.

""*Hispanos*"" (Hispanic) should not be confused with ""hispanoamericanos"" (Hispanic Americans), because the latter one is used to refer people from Spanish America and the first one is Spain-inclusive, what means that can be used as well to refer to Spain and the Spaniards or the Hispanic Americans, it all depends on the context. 

As far as I know, Latin American people of African descent are called as well ""hispanoamericanos"" if they come from a Spanish-speaking country. Again, as far as I know, they only Hispanic American country with a significant amount of African-descent people is the Dominican Republic, so they would be called ""hispanoamericanos"" with no special distinction. 

Finally, *sudaca* and *panchito* are pejorative terms used against Hispanic Americans by some (ignorant) people.

Employment, living-wage employment that allows them to support themselves and their families with their labor, without dependence upon various institutions.

All over the Islamic world, in Europe, the US, and elsewhere, when the economy fails to provide marginalized groups with purpose (with a living-wage job), and then state fails to provide them with purpose (with the tools to gain a living-wage job or just providing such a job directly), churches/mosques step in to fill the purpose void, often with ulterior motives. The recipients of religious support become religiously radicalized in the process. It's happening in the Islamic world, it's happening in the US (with rural white christians), and how it's happening in Europe. 

The unemployment rate among young European muslims is catastrophic. Around 40% unemployment (and around 40% happen to be highly devout muslims... think about it). 

A welfare safety net is great, but people need purpose in life. Having people living long-term in borderline poverty on welfare benefits is a recipe for cultural disaster; whether it's ghetto culture, religious radicalization, turning to drugs or escapism, good outcomes don't flow from long-term unemployment.

 Reduce young French muslim unemployment to 3% (with real living wage jobs, not part-time poverty level junk), and these problems will dry up within a generation. And the same goes for other populations with long-term high unemployment around the world, rural and urban, christian and muslim, white/arab/black etc. If there's a simple answer, it's that living wage jobs are the silver bullet answer to so many social and cultural problems.

true,SoyBeanExplosion,UKGB,United Kingdom,"No, not every single officer is a corrupt bastard, but there's enough of a majority of them that they can shut down attempts to expose their in-club. The police are very much a group of people who will defend each other even if they've broken the law. And I do agree we need to change the way we police demonstrations: there needs to be much less of it. I maintain that the presence of the police and their interaction with the people at these events is the single largest contributor to protests getting out of hand.

I was talking about the 2010 student protests against the increased cap on uni fees. As for the violence there, I'm afraid I'm very much neutral on it. Peaceful protest does nothing. There was a *fantastic* video which I can't find but if I find it I'll show you when we get back next term, and it was an interview in the US at (I think) Occupy Oakland. There was some acts of property damage and the press swooped on it and they were interviewing a protester and they asked him something like ""Do you feel these sorts of acts are drawing the right kind of attention to your movement?"" and he responded with ""It got me on your news channel didn't it?"" If you 'peacefully protest' the news ignores you, if you write a letter or sign a petition the government ignores you, but as soon as you smash a window suddenly the entire press establishment wants you on their TV to talk about your cause.

&gt;but the idea that the average officer enjoys causing pain to people is unsubstantiated.

Nah you're right but I'd say over a third of them. They get off on the power trip. They have no accountability to the public, because they can just beat the shit out of them, plant some drugs on them and arrest them, and they have no accountability to Parliament either. Great example from recently: Theresa May, the bitch, rejected a public inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case, and instead asked that *the police investigate the inquiry themselves.*

&gt;They do not make the laws that you are protesting against.

I agree with the rest of your paragraph, but I have to be honest, this defence of them sounds very much like a rewording of ""I was only following orders.""

I think this positive culture is more widespread than you think. You do not go into a profession like that without some moral integrity.

* We can agree to disagree on whether the police cause riots. But I maintain that unless you are campaigning for something *extremely* serious (such as the right to vote) violence just to get noticed is unacceptable. We all rush to condemn the EDL when their protests get violent, I see no different from anyone else. The fact that no one pays attention to protests is a problem that lies with our political system, not our police.

* No accountability whatsoever? Yes we need *more* accountability, but there are quite a few checks and balances on their power. ""Plant some drugs"" [citation needed], we are not America. Also, we all know Theresa May is an authoritarian scumbag, but she is actually very unpopular with the police as well, being boo'd at the Police Federation conference.

Political Islam is going to grow until it collapses because it cannot deliver on its promises. As with every extreme ideology, but sadely I think it may take decades and those will be lost decades for alot of countries inside the Saudi Arabian sphere of influence.

It spreads like facism did in the 1930s. Facism was more than a form of goverment in the Western nations of Germany, Italy and Spain. It was an idea that took hold of the western world. In the US, in the UK, in South America, in Scandinavia, everywhere there was facist movements with varying degree of success.  Facism was able to take over Germany because of poverty, but the idea of allure of facism itself was a part of the zeitgeist of the era.

It has little to do with poor economy or outlook, because it has been a lot worse without religion turning extreme before.  Forms of Islam that are alot more moderate, like Sufism, developed in times when people had it far far worse off than today.

Maybe just political Islam is resonating very much with the Islamic zeitgeist and Saudi Arabia is using this to spread it's ideas.

If there were 'quite a few' checks and balances then I find it hard to believe that they allowed the continued festering of the disease that is institutional racism in the Met. Maybe they're there but unless we see real concrete acts that demonstrate that they are both willing and able to get a handle on the police service and keep them in line then for all intents and purposes they are not.

Just go in the 12th and the 13th (especially the 13th) arrondissement of Paris+the city of the south-east of Paris like Vitry, Ivry etc. and you'll find nearly a majority of...chinese people.
In fact there's so much chinese people that a huge part of the sign of private owned shop, compagny, etc. in these area are written in french and... chinese. Not the one owned by the State, or the road sign of course.

The only country in the world which can compete with France in terms of accepting immigration for the last 200 years is the U.S.A..
And it's immigration from litteraly everywhere in the world (except UK, Scandinavia and North-America)

But I assume you're not european. Or if you are, you're only getting your news through the small window of your TV or on site like, well, reddit.

For instance, I'm myself french, and trying to count all the bullshit I read about my country and reddit every week make me literally vomit. Especially this week with the happenings in Trappe. There's another thread right now about this subject right now on the frontpage, with something like 300+ comments, and probably 95%+ are garbage.

So I could go and write a wall of text on 5 differents comments about the subject of immigration and social integration since I'm well versed on that matter, and explain you the real reasons of the 2005 events and the ones that just happened in Trappes, in all their complexity, but I really feel like I'd be losing my time., and I am overall really tired.

BUT, just, please, just TRY to think about it a few seconds by comparing with other countries, like the U.S.A. for instance.

There's huge criminality rates in U.S.A., rates that make fool of the french ones, especially among black people and latino. Racially motivated riots are way more common in U.S. history than in the french one, even after the complete end of the segregation, even in the last twenty years.

But are black people and latino muslims ? Nope. They're christians. They're not only christians, they speak european languages and culturally belong to the western world (at least for black people in the U.S.A.). There's far more violences and riots in U.S.A., a country counting very few muslims.

So. Should we considers that black people and latinos are violent just because they're... christians ? OH MY GOD WTF THAT GUY IS SAYING ON REDDIT OMGGGGGGG I AM CHRISTIAN MYSELF WE'RE NOT LIKE THOSE FUCKING MUSLIMS SAND NIGGERS

BUT if we can't make that association for black and latinos, why should we for the muslims in Europe ? Do you believe that these riot are motivated by religion ? That there's nothing else ? That religion even matters in fact ?

Or that the problem is way more complex ?

Seriously. Reddit right now is not really far from the state of mind of a militant of the european Front National of Vlaams Belang.

The people have a responsibility to elect the government, the government has a responsibility to make the law, the police have a responsibility to enforce the law made by the people. I would agree with you if the UK was a dictatorship or the was doing something horrifically bad. But at the same time, a police force that interferes in politics is a dangerous one. I want the police to be impartial when they enforce the law. They can change the law in their own time with the ballot box like everyone else, but when on duty I would never want the police to exercise their political beliefs. It is all very well saying that the police should represent the citizens and not defend the status quo, but surely in a democracy, it is not up to the people to make the status quo in the first place? Should we let the police cater to mob rule and allow lynchings of criminals because it is the people that want to do this?

There is a difference between allowing the police discretion in individual incidents, and letting them chose who has the right to protest and who does not.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; So whats the benefit of being part of the EU?

That things like the classification system for bananas have been harmonized is one of the benefits. It's not just that there are no duties on bananas you import from France (bananas could stand for anything, but for the record the UK does indeed import bananas from French overseas territories that are part of the EU), but that when Tesco wants to buy some, they can easily compare French class I bananas to those from elsewhere and know exactly what they will get and that they will conform to the UK's standard of what ""class I"" means.  
And with bananas, that's still simple. With other products, it would get very complicated rather quickly. Take ingredients for cosmetics, for example. Are they all legal in the UK? If they're from another EU country, or have been tested and cleared for sale in another EU country, they are. If a Danish importer had that new toy from China tested and CE certified already, you don't have to do that again if you want to import it to the UK, because the product safety regulations are the same and EU members recognize each others' certifications. Not only that, but it's such a giant market that manufacturers will take EU regulations into account from the beginning of the design process. We can even push things like the recycling directive or the mandatory two year warranty on manufacturers, and they just have to accept it or they can't sell anywhere in the EU.  
Try that on your own and see how important the UK market is to manufacturers by itself -- for high volume products, they'd probably still jump through the hoops to be able to sell their product in the UK, but some smaller brands or specific models just aren't worth the effort.

In the other direction, it makes doing business with UK companies easy for companies elsewhere in the EU. A Spanish online shop can easily use the services of a payment processor in the UK, because they can be sure that it will handle their customers' data in a manner that conforms with EU privacy regulations.

Every royal house is different and each has its own up and downsides.

In the UK for instance Royals bring in cash for the government, directly through land that they own and give the profits from to the UK government, and indirectly I guess by being a source of tourism/media spectacle. If the UK would get rid of the royals then the royals could take those profits back, and then the UK would be at a net loss compared to before. In the Netherlands and Belgium it is custom for royals to go on trade missions to other countries. A person like the king of Saudi Arabia might be more inclined to open trade routes provided he is treated respectfully by a fellow prince/princess/king/queen. In the UK the monarch is the head of the church so getting rid of the royals will mean reforming the church. Nowadays you can't do that without their consent (since summary execution for heretics is no longer a thing). In the Netherlands the royals are well loved mainly because they are synonymous with patriotism and because they are symbols of Dutch independence from Habsburg Spain and Nazi Germany.

true,Imxset21,GERM,Germany,"&gt;I'm just wondering how anyone living in this world would be surprised that the huge city that is Paris has very busy air traffic.

If city size correlated with air traffic, then that would be a reasonable assumption. [However, a look at the world's busiest city airports shows that this is not the case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_busiest_city_airport_systems_by_passenger_traffic); Denver, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami are all relatively small cities when compared to Paris or Beijing, but are still much higher on the list than much larger cities such as Toronto or Berlin or Beijing. There is a lot of complexity and nuance in this.

Paris is, and has been, largely the exception to most European capitals in the world. If I recall correctly (and as I'm sure are well aware of) France has always been extremely centralized around Paris since the 16th century. But outside of Paris, London and Rome, European national capitals have not always been hubs of power, political or otherwise.

Your explanation does account for how Paris' airport is busy, but it is neither immediate or obvious given the history of development of aeronautical infrastructure. This is not an attempt to discredit Paris' paramount importance to French or Western European commerce and business (and but a cursory glance at La Defense would do away with such a notion altogether).

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; If you look at uncensored crime records, Yes Muslims are disproportionately represented in them, 

I do not know what you refer to as ""uncensored crime records"", perhaps the raw numbers?

When reading any crime statistics one has to tread very carefully, because they can easily be very very misleading. Instead of eyeballing the raw numbers, I'd recommend to carefully listen to criminologists with *relevant experteese* to actually interpret the statistics.

For example, it is an old criminologist adage that the most effective crime prevention method is to celebrate your 30th birthday.

It means that a young person is much more prone to commit crime than a middle-aged or old person. And the steepest drop happens somewhere around 30 years of age.

By far most immigrants are young. That is one significant reason that immigrants are overrepresented in crime statistics when compared to the whole population. And when one is to interpret the numbers one has to account for the demographics. The same goes for socio-economic background etc.

It's also important to note that while those factors are very significant, they do not always explain the whole difference. Yet they are there, and not accounting for them is a misleading way to read and interpret statistics.

I don't know the statistics in your home country, so I'll use Finland as an example.

Members of our local ""we're not racists, but...""-party sometimes trot crime statistics as an example of how horrible immigrants must be. They commonly use cherry picked raw numbers, wich they refer to as ""uncensored"" numbers - as if there was some kind of Government censor changing those numbers in the first place. Then they make colorful claims how ""immigrants"" or ""muslims"" or [pick your minority] commit manyfold more crime than the decent native Finns.

The problem with their claims is that they do not account for the other significant factors at play. And when actual expert criminologists publishes their results which are different, the ""we're not racists, but...""-guys go apes how the numbers have been ""censored"" and how it's all just leftist lies.

Non ho detto che ci sono cose che non quadrano SOLO perché fa l'artista. Ho solo detto di stare in guardia. Un'artista parla con le opere, siccome questa non l'ho mai sentita magari si tratta più di una pseudo-artista che sente un forte bisogno di essere al centro dell'attenzione. Se poi magari è una di quelle persone che fa quelle installazioni con immagini scioccanti per far parlare di se sarebbe un elemento in più per decifrare il suo carattere. Anche nei processi valutano questi dettagli.

&gt;Purtroppo non è inusuale che mogli e fidanzate di uomini violenti si rifiutino di denunciare il compagno

Hanno paura di denunciare quelle che ancora stanno con l'uomo, loro non erano più una coppia. Oppure non denunciano perché lo amano ancora. Non mi sembra questo il caso visto quello che gli sta combinando. Comunque potrebbe anche darsi che non l'avesse denunciato per ragioni affettive e che poi abbia cambiato idea. Non mi convince molto, ma potrebbe essere.

Nelle foto io non vedo lividi, ma solo un po' di sangue (sempre che sia sangue). Metti per esempio che ha i capillari fragili, le sanguina il naso e le viene l'idea della foto. 

Quante poi mettono le foto vecchie di un mese su facebook dicendo d'averlo fatto ""perché i genitori non le credevano""? Ai genitori le poteva far vedere privatamente, mica c'è bisogno di Facebook. Ma metterle su Facebook e al tempo stesso dire che non voleva la gogna mediatica è un controsenso. 

&gt;Ma se anche la donna avesse semplicemente denunciato il cantante senza pubblicare nulla su Facebook, credi che i giornalisti non se ne sarebbero accorti prima o poi?

People who are employed by others don't take jobs, they depend upon employers to give them a job. The common immigrant success story (as with the eastern European nationalities you referenced) is built upon a foundation of hard work. But when hiring discrimination and a shortage of entry level jobs prevent that first step in the immigrant success story, it's not going to turn out well. 

The linked article above takes a look at hiring discrimination in France, comparing employer responses to CVs with a French Christian name to those with a Senegalese Christian name and to others with a Senegalese Muslim name, all of whom with identical credentials and experience. It found that French employers slightly preferred the French Christian over the Senegalese Christian, but they significantly preferred the French Christian over the Senegalese Muslim. In short, the Christian immigrant faces a small hurdle to finding employment, while the Muslim immigrant faces a significant hurdle to finding employment. 

For the low wage jobs that typically are given to immigrants, the employer clearly prefers Christian immigrants (Poles, Romanians, etc) over Muslim immigrants when given a choice, meaning that Muslim immigrants are last in line for jobs. In an economy with high unemployment, the groups that face the most hiring discrimination are going to be the hardest hit, which in Europe are Muslims, and in the US it's urban blacks and rural whites; the culture of all three groups has gone off the rails, and what all three groups have in common is their being last in line for jobs in the last several decades when there haven't been enough jobs for everyone. 

I just think that if various governments focused on ensuring that high-unemployment groups get jobs (whether through fixing hiring discrimination, some sort of incentive program for private employers or providing jobs directly), people like the stereotypical unemployed Muslim immigrant would be working all day instead of sitting around reading the Quran and listening to radical preachers all day, and with a job he'd be able to define success through accumulation of wealth and increasing the material security and comfort of his family like the rest of us, and would no longer have to seek success through non-materialistic alternatives like religious culture-shaping junk.

Danach soll die Anwendbarkeit des EFA auf Personen, die Staatsangehörige der anderen Vertragschließenden sind und die in Deutschland Leistungen zur Grundsicherung für Arbeitsuchende nachsuchen, nicht mehr möglich sein. Der Vorbehalt ist am 19. Dezember 2011 in Kraft getreten. Zweck des Vorbehalts ist es, die Zuwanderung von EU-Bürgern aus südeuropäischen Ländern, in denen es im Zuge der Finanzkrise ab 2007 – insbesondere der Staatsschuldenkrise im Euroraum – eine sehr hohe Arbeitslosenquote gibt, und damit eine „Einwanderung in die Sozialsysteme“ zu unterbinden.~~

Forever.

&gt; ** Have we evaluated the rural development aid? For many more years are Italy going to receive it?

They are going to receive rural development aid as long as they need it, or as long as the EU exists, whichever ends first.

&gt; **When are Spain, Greece, Portugal, Ireland etc going to be net donors, not recipients.

When they start contributing more than they receive.

&gt; May I ask, and I really like for you to answer this - what do you have against goal, planning and evaluation? Give me several good reason why the EU should not have plans, set goals and the evaluate the result. Why do you dislike it? I think it would be a lot better if we had it.**

I have nothing against goals, planning and evaluations. The EU does have plans, goals and it does evaluate the results. You should note that it's a huge organisation so it sometimes takes time for all the evaluations to come in, but they do. If they didn't, then we would have a [list of wasteful projects](http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Content/documents/Pdfs/top50euwaste2010.pdf). Someone evaluated those projects too...

To turn back to what I've already said but I probably should've emphasised cause you didn't read it or didn't notice it's importance. **Sweden is benefitting immensely from other EU countries**, not only financially but also through other means. Spanish oranges may be expensive but your grandparents didn't even know what oranges were. Not to mention the high-tech project in Lund which employs hundreds of physicists (= educated and paid for by other countries) from all over Europe and is financed by the EU (= Greece among others).

As I said, this is a positive-sum game. Everyone benefits. Spain gets money to build roads. Sweden gets smart people to build an accelerator. **This great thing should never end** and the plan is that it **never will**.

In the end, it had reached a scale so massive that some investments are bound to fail and to create a catastrophic domino of indebtedness. 

Now, to see why this is unavoidable, imagine the following scenario. Let's assume that the United States and the United Kingdom do not allow their crazy financial sectors to invent crazy financing instruments. Imagine that Greece placed strict limits on its borrowing. Imagine Spain and Ireland prevented their own banks from investing so heavily in real estate. Imagine that every economic actor that needed money decided not to borrow unless they were extremely sure they were able to service those loans. Then what? The profits would stop getting recycled and the whole system would grind to a halt, leading to deflation, which is the exact situation we have now: everyone is super careful not to take any loans they are not absolutely sure they can't repay and no one is making any investments they are not absolutely sure will pay off.

Another issue in here is that ESM is funded/guaranteed by European governments, essentially European tax payers.

Lets say that banks in France and Germany would go crazy, fuel the biggest investment bubble in the history of Europe, as both France and Germany would be too broke to rescue them, where would the money come?

No. The only solution to solve the problem of member states and banks is that they are all Europeanised from the get go.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I don't really see any way to prevent this problem from reoccurring without disbanding the capitalist system completely. If you want to describe the problem in an abstract way, here's what happened: the financial system, in its effort to turn surpluses into bigger and bigger profits started making bigger and bigger bets, on increasingly risky ventures. In the end, it had reached a scale so massive that some investments are bound to fail and to create a catastrophic domino of indebtedness.

No, no and no. You are not really paying attention. Lets make an example of both Spain and Cyprus. In both of these countries, local politicians were very closely in bed with the banks and because of this, both of these countries are toast. What happened in these countries is that people in power positions took advantage for their own benefits and corrupted the whole local financial system to benefit their own short term goals.

&gt; Now, to see why this is unavoidable, imagine the following scenario. Let's assume that the United States and the United Kingdom do not allow their crazy financial sectors to invent crazy financing instruments. Imagine that Greece placed strict limits on its borrowing. Imagine Spain and Ireland prevented their own banks from investing so heavily in real estate. Imagine that every economic actor that needed money decided not to borrow unless they were extremely sure they were able to service those loans. Then what? The profits would stop getting recycled and the whole system would grind to a halt, leading to deflation, which is the exact situation we have now: everyone is super careful not to take any loans they are not absolutely sure they can't repay and no one is making any investments they are not absolutely sure will pay off. And thus, all our economies are experiencing a slow death whereby all economic activity ceases and we feel that by doing nothing we purify ourselves.

Countries such as Finland and Sweden for example have smoothly sailed out of this crisis because banks in here have been well regulated and they haven't engaged to financial gambling.

And by targetting one very specific crime (and the minority of events in that crime) you are ignoring other violent crimes and other crime statistics in order to suit certain agendas, and there is a definite problem there.

Plus pay attention to all the article that even we on /r/europe have quite often. Police station besieged. Some Norwegian woman arrested for being raped. It's full of source but you wouldn't be interested in reading them since they don't fill in with your butterfly and roses world in which multiculturalism is heaven on Earth, higher crime rates among immigrants don't exist, and we're all just the same. A beautiful rainbow of people living all together in peace, we're all tolerant of each other. And where we give home to these people, tormented by war and gruesome laws. Well now it is us who is tormented by them and it's our women who are afraid to walk the streets more than ever and it is us who are about to be ruled by such laws. It's Europeans that don't have a job. It's Europeans who won't have a home.

Also would you people ***please*** learn what bigot means. A bigot is someone who is intolerant of those who are different in anything including opinions. You're just as bigoted to my opinion, if not more, as I am to Islam. We're all bigots. You're against pedophiles? So am I. We're bigots. This word is so commonly misused and misinterpreted it is starting to give me headaches. Stop throwing the word bigot around as if that's your huge discussion winning secret card that destroys all opposition. Also, you're calling me offensive words. How dare you than preach to me about offending others?

Je crois que la science n'a jamais été aussi impartiale, et globale, et je crois que c'est un bien. J'ai aussi du mal à saisir ce que tu reproches, concrètement, à la science en général, même s'il fait complètement sens de ne pas voir en celle-ci en une unique entité.

Bref, sans plus digresser, d'abord, la sociologie est une science. À fort facteur humain, certes, mais une science tout de même, qui a vocation de répertorier des faits et d'en tirer les lois qui s'imposent. Deuxièmement, la ""théorie du genre"" se réfère également à des arguments médicaux (psychiatriques) et biologiques (génétiques) autrement plus quantifiables que les ""faits sociaux"" que tu rechignes à définir. Donc, une théorie pluridisciplinaire en règle, et validée par la communauté mondiale (l'OMS hein, c'est pas rien). Si tu invalides ladite communauté au nom de... Je sais pas au nom de quoi d'ailleurs, si ce n'est de convictions toutes personnelles, eh bah, forcément, ça aide pas à faire avancer le débat.

""Les êtres humains ne sont pas le genre qu'ils ont."" Exactement! Je sais pas ce que t'appelle genre mais que ce soit le sexe biologique ou le genre social c'est tout à fait dans la logique de la ""théorie du genre"" d'affirmer ça. On est pas cantonné à ce qu'il y a entre nos cuisses. Le genre social est un concept complexe qui regroupe des influences de l'inné et de l'acquis, sujet donc, partiellement au moins, à notre volonté. La science ne décrit pas ici une enceinte dont on ne peut s'affranchir, mais l'étendue infinie de notre choix, de notre liberté, en ce qui concerne une partie seulement de ce qui fait de nous ce que nous sommes.

La religion ""moderne"" dont tu parles s'appelle le scientisme, et date des Lumières. Rien de nouveau, honnêtement, je vois pas ce que l'instrumentalisation de la science aux US vient foutre là. Elle a toujours été un outil, on s'en sert plus ou moins bien, c'est tout. Ça ne décrédibilise pas ses découvertes. L'atome, tu peux tuer des gens avec, ça reste une vérité. La gender theory, tu peux l'utiliser comme tu veux, ça reste un fait, contrairement à ce que tu veux prétendre sans autre argument que ""y'a que des faits sociaux dedans,"" ce qui témoigne de ton ignorance à ce sujet (sorry si je suis un peu abrupt).

Si je t'ai donné l'impression de me proclamer victime du système, je le regrette, et ne le pense pas une seconde.

1. Cars pretty much respect you, unless it's on the city center, in the busiest avenues where there is some serious traffic and speeding and you'll get honked and cursed. The coastal areas are quite nice and improving. The city, however is like granite rollercoaster, with huge steep streets. Makes for good muscle build but also a deterrent for any starter biker. I heard the northern europeans had some sort of lifts to help in these mountainous cityscapes? Anyway, the city is very unfriendly to bikes. No lanes, except the coastal areas. Tight streets and heavy traffic. Do not recommend. The people are friendly though.

2. I take less than 20 minutes anywhere within the city and even the suburbs, while I would take an hour or certainly more by car, with dozens of stop lights. I don't leave the bike outside as it would get stolen. I take it everywhere with me and plan with that in mind. I don't take my bike if I'll be entering office buildings for eight hours.

3. I'd never find the bike after 30 minutes, let alone 8 hours. Seriously.

4. I ride bikes since forever and do all maintenance myself. There are many spots to fix bikes though. Sport Zone for example. Expensive, I heard.

5. No. The city is not friendly to bikes. You wouldn't be taken seriously. Besides, bike parks, lockers and showers are rare in the business centres (old city/old buildings/the idea never caught on). Unless you're a student but still, not all campuses have bike parks. Mine didn't. No one takes responsability for guarding your bike.

6. Never saw a bike rental in the centre of Porto.

7. Not that I'm aware of. There are a few electric bikes coming out of the engineering campuses. These could be a game changer. The gas costs are very high and bikes are fun, clean and escape traffic.

I treat my bike as a physical extension of me. Biking in the city center is still seen as a UFO. Something to be dismissed and laughed at.

However, and this is important, you don't want to risk going past your legal time to be in the country.  As an American, you get 90 days in the EU without a visa.  You can apply for a travel visa or student visa and stay longer if it is granted.  But if you stay past your 90 days, the States can give you a real hard time.  It is within their rights to put you on the no fly list (black list) for going past your visa dates.  That means no leaving the country again without some serious effort.

Et ces principes sont bien sur totalement inapplicables en réalité, je t'ai donné un exemple plus haut qui montre bien qu'on a pas de liberté de s'habiller comme on veut en France. Tu devrais d'ailleurs essayer de faire une liste de tous les pays ou tu as le droit de t'habiller comme tu veux, il doit n'y en avoir *aucun* et je pense que la France doit être parmis les pays les plus cool.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"Look at it this way. German banks who invested in Greek debt, did so to collect on the near 20% interest rates it was going right around the bailout.

That later loan of dwindling interest rates was used to stay afloat but also honor those loans towards other European banks, particularly German, that were more exposed.

Makes sense that those interest rates go down to 0.5 %. That's the ""beauty"" of the system. Bankers pressure governments to relax on the bailout terms and interest rates, so as they can still honor the previous loans. 

Even despite the haircut, the wins of these banks are tremendous. But it is still not enough. It's not enough because they're stupid to buy Wall Street ""junk investments"" in the first place. It's not enough because the debt system is exhausted. Keep in mind that currently, it is the ECB and other EU related mechanisms that hold the larger piece of debt that once belonged to the banks and to the markets.

The right of residence for more than three months remains subject to certain conditions. Applicants must:

    either be engaged in economic activity (on an employed or self-employed basis);
    or have sufficient resources and sickness insurance to ensure that they do not become a burden on the social services of the host Member State during their stay. The Member States may not specify a minimum amount which they deem sufficient, but they must take account of personal circumstances;

    or be a family member of a Union citizen who falls into one of the above categories.

Residence permits are abolished for Union citizens. However, Member States may require them to register with the competent authorities within a period of not less than three months as from the date of arrival. Proof of registration will be issued immediately on presentation of:

    an identity card or valid passport;
    proof that the above conditions are complied with (see Article 9 of the Directive on the proof required for each category of citizen). Union citizens engaged in training must show, by means of a statement or any other means, that they have sufficient resources for themselves and for the members of their families to ensure that they do not become a burden on the social services of the host Member State.

Also, if you continue up the steps on the right side of the garden, you'll end up at Piazzale Michelangelo, which boasts a view of the whole city! Walking is definitely the easiest way to get around, and you can use things like the Duomo and the bridges as points of reference.

true,sydney__carton,null,null,"Hola, I have done exhaustive research on jobs abroad in general and Spain as well.  Have you considered a one year degree program to further yourself?  I got into an MBA program in Barcelona with a cost of 6 grand.  Student Visas allow you to work on the side as long as you are not doing it to support yourself.  Not sure about Spain, but a lot of EU countries allow you a year stay after you get a masters to try and find a job.  Plus after you graduate you could apply for a work visa on the grounds of you having special and needed skills.  You could enroll in a community college in the u.s, sign up for a class and apply for internships in Spain, they usually run around six months.  

Research teaching english through a program, many, many Americans teach English in Barcelona for a year or two.  The work is easy and not extremely time consuming.  A lot of my friends have done it.  It gives you a visa and you can support yourself even more by having a side job.

You have a geoscience degree...?  Could you apply that towards clean energy?  Spain has a large stake in wind energy...

Basically I would suggest the year teaching english or figure out some sort of student visa that will buy you a year.  

And it never really hurts to just apply to every job you find.  You never know what company might need your skills.  Granted it is hard, and the company needs to prove to the Government that you have skills that they cant currently find, but never say never my man.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;Is it right for someone to be in support of the European Union and European unity but then also be in support of independence movements that actively try to break apart from European countries?

Actually, I think one stems from the other. As Europe becomes more and more united and more and more power is handed over to Brussels, the unity of the constituent countries becomes less and less relevant. If borders become less like actual border fences and more like [lines separating provinces](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Baarle-Nassau_fronti%C3%A8re_caf%C3%A9.jpg/640px-Baarle-Nassau_fronti%C3%A8re_caf%C3%A9.jpg), while a lot of decisions happen at EU level, you can have way more flexible interstate borders because there is less reason to keep the state together. 

If Catalonia becomes independent, with Schengen and all you won't feel the border any more than you do today. So secession means less separation than it did in the past.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I apologies my initial comment was excessively shape in tone. I still respectfully disagree. the protester cannot protest anywhere near the actual sight of the event. I understand the concern with vitriolic and so forth, however the point of democracy is that everyone as a right to peacefully protest their views. By pushing the protesters out of the city centre, they will feel marginalised, this will most likely create a future sense of alienation. This pushes people towards the extremes.

In terms of austerity, I said 'whether you agree its the right course or not', I wasn't making an policy argument. The point I was making was that the actual effect of the austerity are brutal on the lives of the people. They have a right to protest if they disagree with the policies being persued and those who implement them. 

There is also the assumption that the protests are based in blind outrage. We saw this with the Spanish protests, they were widely reported as protests against cuts, but they were also against corruption and the protection of special interests which was largely underplayed by the media. In Greece, there are extremists yes, but the majority of protesters are ordinary middle class people. To assume they are politically clueless is an error.

This is part of a wider failure to listen to descenting voices both before and after the start of the crisis, which has contributed to the maelstrom were in. A well intentioned group think among the EU leaders has led to disastrous policies. The mantra of solidarity created a TINA (there is no alternative) mentality which as worsened the situation considerable. A sort of 'your with us or against' which causes unnecessary division. The need for QE and monetary transfers was obvious 4 years ago, but it was ignored. We need more diverse voices in the debate, and in EU politics in general. 

On economics
Obviously, Germany are caught with elections coming up this year, in terms of providing investment so we'll see after the elections. I would still be concerned with the sheer level of investment, haircuts, and monetary transfers, and QE needed to all non core countries may still be politically infeesible.

 I'm unsure if Germany can afford them either. Also these transfers will be massive, and need to be permanent, and recovery will be slow, as it will take 30-40 year for productivity to catch up in the peripheries (given perfect conditions). Also, if reports are to be believed, Deutche bank is in serious trouble (3% reserves) and the China slowdown will also cause problems.

To correct the balance of payments Germany wages need to rise significantly, which Germany industry will resist aggressively. Jobs investment will be useless if there isn't a healthy consumer base to sell to.

The lack of a common language is a massive problem in elevating skilled unemployment friction. Also human capital loses to un/underemployment are already massive. Automation of labour is going to have cause unemployment/social friction.

Netherlands are at the beginning of a property crash (equivalent to Ireland's). Italy is in danger of needing bailouts, and political change is close to impossible there. Slovenia is tethering also. France is in stagnation and in danger of contraction. 

To rescue the euro need massive changes which I am unsure are politically possible. Some countries may have to leave, or the currency may split into a Euro North and Euro South. I hope that if saving it is possible that action will be decisive, and that if countries cannot survive in the Euro they will be assisted to leave amicably and not kept straggling. Failure to do either will be disastrous for the EU as a whole

**TL;DR: Right to protest is essential in democracy. Large exclusion zone creates sense of alienation. No Alternative mentality has worsened situation and narrowed debate. Solving crisis much more expensive and will take longer than we are told. May not be politically/economically feesible. Failure to be decisive and pragmatic could seriously damage EU unity.**

On est sur reddit hein. Et au-delà de ça je crois qu'il y avait tout de même des idées là dedans.

&gt;Peut-être que tu renies le fait que des femmes ne portent pas le niqab par choix?? J'ai cru que tu admettais que toutes les femmes ne choisissaient pas? Peut-être que je me suis trompé

&gt;si tu admets qu'il y a bien des femmes qui en souffre, alors tu proposes quoi pour les aider? L'état n'a pas beaucoup d'arme a part mettre des amendes, interdire des groupes communautaires etc...

Elles souffrent de quoi? C'est ça la question. On a des lois contre les violences conjugales, physiques ou psychologiques. On a des lois pour lutter contre l'intégrisme. Mais le port du voile *en soi* n'est pas automatiquement lié à tout cela. Si des femmes se pensent heureuses sous leur niqab c'est peut être en effet de l'aliénation mais c'est subjectif. Donc ça me semble extrêmement dangereux quand l'Etat veut décider de protéger les gens contre eux-mêmes: qui a le droit de décider quels types de vêtements sont néfastes à l'équilibre des gens? Dans ce cas là on pourrait imaginer proscrire, selon l'époque et la tendance politique, les tenues anarchistes, hippies, skin heads etc... On ne peut pas empêcher les gens d'être cons et on est tous le con d'un autre. Tant que la femme en question n'est pas victime de quelqu'un et qu'elle ne fait pas de prosélytisme je ne vois pas de raison de l'empêcher de porter ce qu'elle veut. Le meilleur moyen pour les aider à mon sens c'est, comme bien souvent, l'éducation. Cette loi aurait plutôt tendance à les ostraciser davantage.

Autre parallèle: la prostitution. Bien sûr que la grande majorité des prostituées sont des victimes, forcées à exercer et soumises à toutes sortes de violences. On a des lois pour lutter contre les réseaux (ça n'a pas l'air d'être très efficace). Mais est-ce qu'on doit interdire à la minorité de femmes qui choisissent de se prostituer de le faire parce qu'on pense que c'est un asservissement? A mon avis non, pour les mêmes raisons.

Je suis d'accord. Je suis athée et je trouve que la baisse du nombre de pratiquants est une bonne chose.

&gt;la pratique religieuse est discriminatoire comme avec le voile et le niqab (y a jamais eu de problème avec les mains de fatmas que je sache).

Une femme qui porte un voile/niqab est forcément plus discriminée (par qui?

The castilian (and from later on spanish) empire had a lot of ""more"", as many europeans empires (I'm looking at you, Portugal and France). Were they better *because* of that amount of people and territory? Absolutely no, and at medium and long term not even the metropolis.

Someone would say that a process of fragmentation is the exact opposite of the modern tendency in the world, which is aggregation as in the EU. But the EU is not so much about aggregation than coordination. Access to any unit from within any other unit is what truly defines globalization and the modern processes of aggregation, and not just being all under a common system (I. Wallerstein, anyone?)

So, if Scotland keeps ""coordinated"", that is, within the EU and the pound, the transition costs are very low, and the same goes for England. What if they have to adopt the euro, or, call me crazy, are left out of the EU*? Transition costs will be higher, but nowadays countries do not cease to exist just because of that. From Iceland to Zimbabwe, from North Korea to Mexico, countries do exist.

Concerning Strasbourg, I guess it depends on you budget but since you are planning quite far in advance I think you'll be on the safe side. The nicest places to stay at would be in the city center (Petite France neighborhood would be the cutest but most expensive) or perhaps Orangerie. Try to avoid staying around the train station (Gare) or too far away from the center. Anything close to Gutemberg, Cathédrale, Kléber, Marché au Vin, Ponts couverts, Broglie, ... should be fine!

Colmar is a beautiful little city with a great Christmas vibe, It is an excellent choice and just about 30-45min away by train. However to me, the most beautiful Christmas market in the area is the one from Kaysersberg which is just a few km away from Colmar (I think you can also go there by train, must be something like a 10-15 min ride).

As such some questions are only going to be answerable within the period between a yes vote and secession from the union.

For example, Trident. The Scottish government are committed to removing it but to do so obviously requires the participation of the UK government. Other than the very odd idea of [unilaterally annexing Faslane](http://news.sky.com/story/1114283/scottish-trident-base-claims-preposterous), that process could not begin without both governments deciding how to do it.

Similarly with the EU - the Scottish government wish to remain in the EU, and the most sensible approach would be for secession from the UK to happen on the same date as joining the EU. But there is no process for a country within an EU member state to become an EU member in its own right, so how exactly that would unfold is unclear (other than there is nothing to gain for Scotland, rUK, or the EU if part of the EU was to be temporarily ejected - so it's reasonable to assume that a way would be found).

The referendum is also a referendum on if Scotland should become independent, not what an independent Scotland should look like. Decisions on currency, defence, etc, are all really matters for the post-independence government.

The referendum is in 2014 and the next election is 2016, so while the current government can propose a policy on something like currency (a ""[sterling-zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_area)"" arrangement with the UK, as used by Ireland for 50+ years) other parties are going to compete for your vote based on their plans.

true,xaxisycross,null,null,"So here's the story:

My wife, my 18 month old son and I were travelling with another couple who have a child roughly the same age as my son. We had a [mini-bus/people mover](http://i.imgur.com/www3M0j.jpg) and for this part of our journey we were driving from Barcelona to a place called [Collioure](https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=Collioure,+France&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sll=42.267909,2.96133&amp;sspn=0.058561,0.11776&amp;oq=colliou&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Collioure,+Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales,+Languedoc-Roussillon,+France&amp;z=12) in South-East France. It's not a massive trip but with two toddlers, it's hard to keep them distracted and errrm... not screaming. So we stopped in [Figueres](https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=Figueres,+Spain&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=42.267909,2.96133&amp;spn=0.058561,0.11776&amp;sll=-32.830735,147.451465&amp;sspn=8.508416,15.073242&amp;oq=figueres&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Figueres,+Girona,+Catalonia,+Spain&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=A) and then decided to take a detour through [Cadaques](https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=Cadaqu%C3%A9s,+Spain&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sll=42.526752,3.084631&amp;sspn=0.11664,0.235519&amp;oq=Cada&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Cadaqu%C3%A9s,+Girona,+Catalonia,+Spain&amp;z=12) as it was somewhere we had thought of staying in our planning phase.
So we head over the mountain road, through some spectacular regions and descend on this amazing port town. The road along Cadaques waterside is pretty much all one way and it's hard to find a place to park with that much car/bus/personnel carrier so we end up right at the end of the road but [right by a beach](https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=42.28475,3.287999&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=19) which [looks stunning](http://i.imgur.com/wB3tIQj.jpg). We all need a break, it's hot and the kids need to actually do something physical so we park the beast in [this public, occupied, not particularly noteworthy carpark right nearby](https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=42.284338,3.289032&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=19) and go and have a [look at the beach](http://i.imgur.com/eR6olpt.jpg). We were gone for about 15 minutes before my wife thought we should leave because the guy was waiting for us at our next accommodation. So we reluctantly dragged ourselves and the kids back to the car and found the front passenger window smashed and the car cleaned out.

This was no mean feat. We were two couples with kids travelling heavy. Probably over 200kg of luggage, baby cots, backpacks with tablets, GPS, even the sweet rig of charging/audio leads I'd set up for the car stereo. All gone. Astonishing. 

Needless to say, it meant a massive disruption to our travels and meant getting new passports and well, everything really. It really put a downer on the whole trip.
So that's the really short story of what happened and I really doubt you'll find yourself in the same situation where that would happen to you. Of course, the obvious thing to say is don't leave any of your luggage/valuables unattended, ever. But we were gone for 15 minutes, y'know. You just wouldn't ever think that would happen.

[Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/vpigwsC.jpg) taken about a week after the event of the car in a carpark next to a sign we found irresistible.

Thanks for listening.

TL;DR: If you have 200kg of belongings, take it out of the car if you stop to look at a beach.

Prima c'e' il rifiuto. Prendi consapevolezza di valere piu' di 1200 euri al mese con contratto cococo. Gli amici gia' all'estero raccontano di terre dove scorre la birra e le patatine (Belgio) e alla fine parti pure tu.

Quando in macchina abbiamo superato la scritta ~~PISA~~ la mia ragazza e' scoppiata a piangere e pure a me una lacrimuccia scese. MA siccome sono un vero uomo ho soffocato i miei sentimenti fino al giorno che saliro' su un campanile con un fucile di precisione. Ma sto divagando.

L'arrivo nella citta' straniera e' traumatico. Tutto ti sembra grigio, scuro, piovoso e brutto. Vedi in giro un sacco di gente di paesi diversi. Addirittura persone di colore che, invece di vendere accendini, lavorano in giacca e cravatta.

Poi trovi un lavoro. Ed e' sempre migliore di quello in Italia. Stipendio quasi doppio, metro/treno rimborsati, 13esima, 14esima. A lavoro non ti senti ""grato"" di averlo. Te lo meriti. Sono loro che ringraziano i dipendenti alle occasioni di gala.

Passano i mesi e ripensi a quando la citta' ti sembrava grigia, scura, piovosa e brutta. Avevi ragione. Poi guardi i prezzi delel case e vedi che un appartamento da 93m^2 lo mettono a 140.000 euri. La banca ti concede il 100% del mutuo, senza dover fare l'ipoteca sulla casa dei tuoi, dei suoi, dei nonni e sulla cuccia del cane. E senza anticipo. A Pisa con quella cifra ci prendevo un bilocale. In periferia.

Also note that /u/mojojo42 says that 'many' feel more Scottish than British. He is right that there are many, but they do not constitute anywhere near a majority. The independence buzz is popular amongst 30-40 % of the population depending on the poll being taken on a good day or not.

The problem with this referendum is its questionable setup.
Alex Salmond (the Scottish First Minister and key figure behind the independence movement) is a very good politician and knows what he needs to get his referendum passed. This involves allowing 16-17 year old people vote at the referendum, denying the 800 000 Scots living in the rest of the UK to vote, yet allowing anyone living in Scotland for the past 5 years (including non nationals from abroad) to vote. 
There are plenty of English in Scotland, most of whom will probably vote 'no', but they are far fewer than the Scots living in the rest of the UK who would probably vote 'no' as well. 

It doesn't help Salmond's image that he casually promotes images of crappy films like Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' and other bogus symbols of nationalism.

The big fear is that many Scots won't show up at the referendum. It is probably that all those who wish for independence will show up, but many of those who don't may not bother (thinking their vote doesn't matter and that independence won't happen anyway). Should all these votes be neglected? Should they be set at 'yes' or 'no' by default?
Surely a non-vote indicates that you do not support the 'yes' motion?

What is only 50 % of voters show up, and 51 % of them vote yes? That means Scotland can get independent with 25 % of the vote! 
There should be a threshold of at least 60-70% participation for the referendum to be valid, and then surely it should be quite a large majority wishing for independence? Something like over 60% at least! 
Over 50 % is just not quite enough to resolve such a divisive case.

Well, a newly independent Scotland (or Catalonia etc.) wouldn't be signatory to any international agreements yet, including all of the contracts the EU is based on. So, it would have to join on its own.

I don't see any barriers to this, though, and ideally it could be handled within a transition period between the decision to secede and actual independence that would be sensible to ensure a smooth transition, anyway.  
Normally, when a new country joins the EU, it has to be made sure that all its laws conform with EU directives and regulations. But Scotland would start out with keeping the same laws that are in force now, and they already conform. There still would be a few points, like fishing quotas, but there would also be a strong incentive to quickly come to an agreement on those -- especially for Scotland and the rUK, because businesses on both sides would need the security that their existing ties would be unaffected, and being within the EU framework would ensure that.",0,1374485743,null,0,false,0,cb7ptv1,t3_1ise7x,t1_cb7ptv1,t1_cb7oou3,null,1430380491,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,Tuttle_not_Buttle,SCOT,Scotland,"I was thinking of the reasons people might have for or against independence, so I jotted some down - I think they fall broadly into ""positive"" and ""negative"" reasons for each. Although it's my subjective categorisation so you may disagree.

**For**:

*Positive*:

* Cultural reasons - could allow a blossoming of the Scottish culture in its own environment. May allow for a greater pride in ""Scottishness"" and the Scottish culture, and stop the ""Scottish cringe""

* We are already seen as separate (see also *negative*) - we have a separate government, legal system, education system, healthcare system, and recognisable culture. Could see independence as the logical step from this. Being Scottish is recognised within the UK as a distinct idea

* We are already seen as separate *abroad* (see also *negative*) - if you go abroad, almost everyone is aware of Scotland and Scottish people (even if this is only by virtue of whisky, Braveheart, Sean Connery). This can't be said about other parts of the UK (Yorkshire, Cornwall, even Wales sometimes)

* We identify primarily as Scottish - the [majority of Scots](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/oct/06/survey-uk-identity) label themselves as Scottish before British

* Politics (see also *negative*) - Scotland has a clearly different political leaning to England (if you take England as a whole). Independence could allow this to be better reflected. (I'm not necessarily convinced of politics as a reason, as politics can change, but it is persuasive for many. It could also allow a proper conservative party to emerge in Scotland)

* Influence (see also **against**) - we would be able to represent our own interests in international fora, rather than being a part of the UK's consideration. While the UK has a responsibility to represent all its people. even if these interests are conflicting, Scotland could focus on its interests alone

* Cultural reasons, the flourishing of ""Britishness"" - as suggested by Irvine Welsh, if we were free from the forced proximity and tensions of the UK state, a real sense of cultural Britishness could emerge

* Governance - as with influence, a more local governance would be more attuned to the needs of the people, rather than having to balance the interests of 60m

* Financial reasons (see also **against**) - suggestions that Scotland could be more prosperous on its own. Figures suggest that Scotland more than pays its way. Would at least not be a financial catastrophe

* Less likely to become involved in conflicts, tolerate nuclear weapons

* Aspire to the Nordics - would be able to set the course of the nation more freely, and aspire to the Nordic countries, with whom we share a similar sized population

* Idea of the nation state - nation states developed to protect the cultures of their peoples, but not all cultures gained their own state. Scotland could gain such a protection for its culture

*Negative*:

* Already seen as separate (see above) - there is blame and sniping between the constituent members of the UK, with accusations over financial contributions, and resentment over treatment in the media (I'm looking at you, BBC 6 nations coverage...)

* Spite - have been repeatedly told by the rest of the UK, and Scots, that Scotland can't do it alone

* Not recognised as different abroad (see above) - the frustration of Edinburgh, England, and ""Scotland, that's in England, right?""

* Politics (see above) - voting yes because you don't like the Conservatives (they needn't be in power for ever)

* Don't like associations of being British - want to escape the baggage of imperialism, involvement in wars

* Fear that if vote no, may face some revenge, or never get the chance again


I don't necessarily agree with all of these reasons, they are just ones that I have heard, or ideas I have considered. You may disagree with the categorisations, as I said. Reasons against below...

edit - I'll also add ""Interest in seeing what happens"" as a reason. Don't know which category I'd stick that in though...

Whether independence is a good idea depends on the region, and the way it's currently set up I believe further internal fragmentation would make it more difficult to agree on common policies within the EU, but I don't think it's necessarily a contradiction to support independent regions on the one hand and an integrated Europe on the other.

It could be argued that the EU makes regional independence viable that would otherwise be difficult, because it takes care of many of the problems small countries would otherwise face if they were on their own. Their businesses would still operate within a large economic area that minimizes the kind of friction and bureaucratic overhead that normally comes with transnational business deals. They'd also be a part of a large block to negotiate on their behalf on the global stage, while gaining the freedom to make their own decisions based on their local situation, and, in the case of rich regions, spending their taxes locally.

So, it depends on the region in question whether it would be beneficial for them, I don't think there's a universal answer.

* Feel British, don't want to separate - similar to above. People will feel a connection to the state or have familial connections to the rest of the UK. While most people feel Scottish before British (see above) there are still a lot of people that feel British to some degree

* Influence (see above) - may perceive the UK as having a stronger voice in the world. While it is not dedicated to Scotland alone, it is undoubtedly a bigger presence in the world - Security Council, etc

* Stability (financial) - people may want to stay attached to a larger state as they see this as giving a greater stability in economic terms

*Negative*:

* Too much effort - some people may simply see it as too much effort to separate, and can't be bothered. ""We are too connected to sort it all out"", etc

* Fear - many fear that we are not in a position to survive financially, and are scared of the practicalities of border controls, etc, whatever the tiny probability that they may occur

* Lack of clarity - there are many unanswered questions so far by the Yes campaign, and many do not want to vote yes without these answered

* Politics (see above) - people may vote against as they don't like the SNP (see above for the Tories). Or because they ""don't want to leave England with the Tories"" (although this seems not to be grounded in fact)

* Don't want to drive a wedge - people see the rest of the UK as our closest allies, and don't want to do anything which may jeopardise that close relationship or drive us apart

Strongest opposition comes from Scandinavian countries Denmark (76%), Sweden and Finland (71%), then UK (54%).

Strongest support comes from Poland (63%), Czech Republic (55%) and France (55%).

The demographic group with the strongest support for the idea is Male, 25-39, the highest educated (end of education +20y category), white collar, upper class, with a strong political interest.

The countries which currently want it with an absolute majority are Poland, Czech Republic, France, Cyprus, Austria and Slovakia.

Countries where a relative majority want it are Luxembourg, Belgium, Spain, Latvia, Germany, Hungary, Portugal, Slovenia, Estonia, Italy, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Malta and Romania (in descending order of approval).

Avessi detto che sia ""ottimale vivere così"" ti avrei dato ragione. Ok, beh, mettendo le cose in prospettiva, forse sì. 

Io ho 25 anni, sono italiano per nascita, sin da quando sono nato ho usufruito di uno dei sistema sanitari migliori del mondo (perchè questo è/era) in maniera pressoché del tutto gratuita, ho ricevuto vaccini, anni di medicinali, visite mediche di base e specialistiche, esami di laboratorio e diagnostici ad un prezzo quasi inferiore a quello di costo o in maniera del tutto gratuita. 

Poi sono andato a scuola. Ho passato buona parte della mia vita usufruendo di migliaia di ore di lezioni in maniera praticamente del tutto gratuita, elementari, medie e poi superiori. 

Poi sono andato all'università, e mi è stata offerta la possibilità di seguire corsi introduttivi a materie avanzate prima e poi, durante la specialistica, i mezzi e le nozioni appartenenti al bleeding edge del mio ambito di studi, da parte di persone che si occupano effettivamente di quello che mi hanno insegnato, e sono apprezzate a livello internazionale per quello che fanno. Il tutto, per una cifra di due/tre mila euro in tasse universitarie. 

Io oggi ho una preparazione avanzata, sono sano come un pesce e seguito, e ho avuto negli anni la possibilità di esprirmi come preferivo e seguire le mie passioni. E non devo, letteralmente, un euro a nessuno. 

Però, forse, un debito di riconoscenza nei confronti di qualcuno o di qualcosa che mi ha permesso di avere questa fortuna, ce lo ho, e alla fine, direi, che si, mi è andata abbastanza *ok*, fin'ora.

1) Renewable energy would be best spent domestically. There would be no economic incentive to build infrastrucutre to take that power to Norway. 2) The infrastrucure for such power transmission without loss does not exist at present and would be hugely expensive and pollutive (thus cutting the 'green' incentive). 3) Norway recieves so much rain that our hydro capacity is almost always at present and there is no infrastructure to pump water into the resevoirs (another added cost and pollutive action) like there is in Germany, which is far more energy intensive than Norway.

true,robespierring,null,null,"**Criticare l'Italia è un comportamento da Italiano medio.**

Potrei farci una guida, un bestiario se vogliamo, per riconoscere le mille sfumature del ""criticone italiano"".

Sì, perchè non si tratta del semplice ""*essere cattivi con l'Italia*"". Se si trattasse semplicemente di questo dovremmo trattare il ""criticone italiano"" come una persona particolaramente intollerante nei confronti del malcostume vario, ma non è così. Non si tratta semplicemente di dove mettiamo l'asticella, perchè il bestiario del ""criticone italiano"" è molto più articolato.

Alcuni tratti del ""criticone italiano"":

* **Generalizzazione di comportamenti rari**. è il caso dell'articolo del blog che citi. Vede un singolo italiano il cui bagaglio pesa oltre il massimo consentito, ma ignora gli altri 300 individui che invece il bagaglio ce l'hanno regolarissimo, quindi scrive una bella filippica su quanto gli ""*italiani non siano in grado di prendere un aereo*"". D'altronde quel singolo individuo è più vicino ai suoi preconcetti, quindi nella sua testa è ""più italiano"", nonostante ce ne siano 300 che potrebbero farlo ricredere. E' il [Selection bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) e il [Confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) che diventa opera d'arte.

* **Italianizzazione di comportamenti universali**. Se vedo un italiano avere dei problemi in aereoporto, non penso di essere testimone del tipico idiota italiano, ma penso di essere testimone di una tipica situazione in un aeroporto, come capita a tutti e ovunque in tutto il mondo. Tanto che in Australia ci hanno fatto un [reality show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S74PcWn7cNw). Ma ancora: quale migliore occasione di pensare che quella è l'ennesima conferma dell'idiozia italiana? Troppe volte ho visto comportamenti e malcostumi additati come  caratteristiche tipicamente e unicamente italiane, quando invece erano comportamenti riscontrabili in ogni paese. 

* **Da zero a politica in 20 secondi**. Se con il ""criticone italiano"" parli di cibo, vita notturna, trasporti, infrastrutture e meteo, dopo poco tempo la critica omnia diventa una critica alla politica e al sistema, anche quando la politica non c'entra nulla. 

* **Lui è fuori dal ""perimetro criticabile""**. Per qualche ragione esiste un perimetro dentro la quale c'è il marcio e fuori dalla quale ci sono le vittime del marcio. Un confine netto che separa i buoni dai cattivi, i pensatori dai pecoroni, i retti dai corrotti. Mai una volta che io abbia sentito una sana riflessioni su sè stessi come individui. Perchè il criticone è nella parte esterna del confine, quella dove si è autorizzati a criticare tutto e tutti perchè si è delle innocenti vittime delle circostanze.


Il bestiario potrebbe continuare...

&gt;Je pense que t'as raison d'évoquer les réminiscences de l'eugénisme allemand dans la pensée contemporaine, mais je pense aussi que tu les places au mauvais endroit. Je crois que la science n'a jamais été aussi impartiale, et globale, et je crois que c'est un bien. J'ai aussi du mal à saisir ce que tu reproches, concrètement, à la science en général, même s'il fait complètement sens de ne pas voir en celle-ci en une unique entité.

Question : Es-tu scientifique ? Dans les sciences dures, il est difficile de publier sur certains sujets. Dans les sciences humaines, il est impossible de publier si tu vas contre la doxa. La science n'a jamais été impartiale, elle est faite par des hommes avec tout ce que cela implique. 

&gt;Bref, sans plus digresser, d'abord, la sociologie est une science. À fort facteur humain, certes, mais une science tout de même, qui a vocation de répertorier des faits et d'en tirer les lois qui s'imposent.

Personne n'a nié que la sociologie était une science. Mais c'est une science humaine. J'aimerais que tu m'énonces une seule loi sociologique. Mais tu serais bien en peine de le faire. 

&gt;Deuxièmement, la ""théorie du genre"" se réfère également à des arguments médicaux (psychiatriques) et biologiques (génétiques) autrement plus quantifiables que les ""faits sociaux"" que tu rechignes à définir.

Oui, la théorie du genre prend des faits pour construire une histoire. C'est bien comme ça que cela fonctionne. 

&gt;et validée par la communauté mondiale (l'OMS hein, c'est pas rien). 

Que vient foutre l'OMS dans de la sociologie ? L'OMS ne fait même pas de peer review. C'est une administration politique qui n'a pas valeur de validation scientifique. C'est la réalité. Ce que j'en pense c'est que c'est encore la preuve d'un lobbying acharné et forcené. Après, je ne dis pas que ce n'est pas une bonne chose, si cela va dans le sens d'une meilleure protection de certaines minorités ou populations opprimées. Il y a certainement un gros enjeu politique. Mais cela n'en fait pas vérité. 

&gt; Le genre social est un concept complexe qui regroupe des influences de l'inné et de l'acquis

Sauf qu'il s'agit de dire : l'inné, c'est le bien, les acquis notamment éducatif et sociaux, c'est le mal. Idéologie. On revient presque à l'état de nature de Rousseau. 

&gt;La religion ""moderne"" dont tu parles s'appelle le scientisme, et date des Lumières.

On en était pas mal revenu. Et ça date plutôt du 19e. M'enfin. 

&gt;Rien de nouveau, honnêtement, je vois pas ce que l'instrumentalisation de la science aux US vient foutre là.

Le gender studies n'existe qu'aux US. 

&gt;Elle a toujours été un outil, on s'en sert plus ou moins bien, c'est tout. 

Un outil, oui, le second livre des révélations, non. C'est ce que les politiciens US travaillent à faire. 

&gt;La gender theory, tu peux l'utiliser comme tu veux, ça reste un fait, contrairement à ce que tu veux prétendre sans autre argument que ""y'a que des faits sociaux dedans,"" ce qui témoigne de ton ignorance à ce sujet (sorry si je suis un peu abrupt).

La sociologie derrière le gender studies recouvre une certaine réalité. Mais le domaine du gender studies est celui de l'idéologie politique. De plus, comme je l'ai déjà dit, ce n'est pas UN FAIT. Une théorie ce n'est pas un fait. Tu parles de science mais tu ne sais même pas ce que c'est. On peut parler de modèle corroboré par des faits. Mais l'atome, ce n'est pas un fait. C'est un modèle qu'on développe plus ou moins bien, qui explique certaines choses, qui laisse certaines zones d'ombre. Enfin bref, tu me traites d'ignorant mais tu ne peux même pas parler de science correctement. C'est très irritant. 

&gt;Quant aux ""lacunes intellectuelles"" que tu évoques sentencieusement, j'aimerais en connaître l'exacte nature.

cf supra. C'est peut-être prétentieux mais ayant fait de la recherche, je sais à quel point il est facile d'avoir des faits et de les interpréter à sa sauce pour avoir un article ""vendeur"". Quand il s'agit de bio, on fleure l'escroquerie à tripatouiller des modèles statistiques. Je ne connais pas bien le gender studies, mais connaissant son usage extrême des statistiques, il m'est facile d'extrapoler ses conséquences sur l'intégrité des résultats produits. 

&gt;Ma digression sémantique n'avait nullement vocation à fustiger la langue française en général, et ne visait précisément que cette traduction qui, tu l'admettras (et c'est aussi le cas de la théorie de la relativité), peut prêter à confusion. 

Il n'y a aucune confusion. La science prend des faits, de manière rationnelle, et produit de la théorie, pas de la vérité. Si tu me disais que tu penses que la théorie de la relativité est un fait et devrait s'appeler le fait de la relativité ou l'étude de la relativité, je te dirais que tu n'es pas un scientifique.

Nel 2009 sono stato in vacanza in Messico, con un volo charter, per due settimane. Pochi giorni dopo il mio arrivo, scoppiò [l'epidemia di influenza suina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic). Io mi trovavo nello Yucatan, molto lontano dall'epicentro che era a Città del Messico, quindi, una volta raccolte le necessarie informazioni, decisi con la mia famiglia di non interrompere le mie vacanze. Nel frattempo in Italia la situazione in Messico veniva descritta dai media come la Morte Nera del 1348, solo un po' più rapida a diffondersi.
Nella seconda settimana di vacanza le disdette svuotarono gli alberghi (io ci guadagnai un upgrade gratuito) e molti turisti che avevano prenotato le vacanze in Messico furono dirottati dalle agenzie di viaggio a Cuba o a Santo Domingo. Al momento di prendere il volo di ritorno all'aeroporto di Cancun, apprendemmo che il nostro aereo, prima di atterrare in Messico, aveva fatto scalo a l'Havana per raccogliere gli italiani in vacanza lì. Il risultato fu che l'aereo atterrò in Messico già mezzo pieno di italiani che erano andati in vacanza a Cuba per sfuggire all'epidemia di influenza, e che ora si trovavano a dovere condividere il viaggio con noi italiani che tornavamo dal Messico. Infuriati per il raggiro, molti passeggeri cominciarono a protestare, rifiutandosi di accettare vicino ai loro sedili i viaggiatori imbarcati in Messico. Si aspettavano anche di vederci moribondi, quindi non capivano come mai fossimo tutti allegri e abbronzati (""Ma questa epidemia c'è o non c'è?"", si chiedevano). Dopo una mezzora di urla e proteste (""Non sono andato in vacanza a Cuba per farmi 12 ore di aereo con chi è appena stato in Messico!"", ""Ho pagato il biglietto come lei e ho diritto a al mio posto!"") si fece vivo il capitano, che minacciò di lasciare in custodia alla polizia messicana i più facinorosi. Gli animi si placarono e partimmo. Tuttavia, invece di atterrare a Malpensa, ci fecero fare scalo a Fiumicino, dove dovemmo sbarcare tutti. Degli operatori del Ministero della Sanità ci diedero un volantino con un numero di telefono da chiamare in caso di sintomi sospetti, ci rimbarcarono tutti e ci fecero ripartire alla volta di Malpensa. La sosta a Fiumicino durò circa tre ore.

Representative democracy limits it, because politicians have to have advisers, have to go to committees, where there are actual economists and scientists and ask them questions, which option is the best, etc. So, it kind of is that politicians learn something, and then vote for the best option.

Bringing the voting age in line with legal adulthood will increase the electorate by about 100,000 people: given that there are 4 million people who can currently vote, that's only a 2.5% increase.

Polls suggest that this group are actually [more likely to vote no](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-22745855), yet it is happening regardless.

&gt; denying the 800 000 Scots living in the rest of the UK to vote, yet allowing anyone living in Scotland for the past 5 years (including non nationals from abroad) to vote.

Since there is no definition of ""Scottish citizenship"" yet, the franchise is pretty simple - if you're registered to vote in Scotland (e.g., you can vote for the Scottish parliament) then you're allowed to vote. There are about 800K people born in Scotland who now live elsewhere in the UK, however around 400K people born outside of Scotland now live in Scotland.

There are always going to be edge cases, but if someone lived 5 years of their life in Scotland and 35 in England why should they have a vote purely based on their place of birth?

&gt; What is only 50 % of voters show up, and 51 % of them vote yes? That means Scotland can get independent with 25 % of the vote! There should be a threshold of at least 60-70% participation for the referendum to be valid, and then surely it should be quite a large majority wishing for independence? Something like over 60% at least!

This is essentially the ""[40% rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_devolution_referendum,_1979#.2240.25.22_rule)"" that was introduced at the last-minute for the 1979 referendum.

You also make it sound like England has no natural resources which is false, and this is a fairly unique situation. The oil and gasses found in the North Sea are currently owned by the United Kingdom.
One small segment breaking off and taking an entire countries oil supply is hardly going to go down well. There will be heavy debate over what happens to it.

Lets say we where neighbours and we decided to join up. The separating walls knocked down and we became one big happy house.

Then we found a gold vein running across both gardens, the biggest portion of which was on yours. You both work together to start extracting, selling and make a fortune. 

You then decide to leave, claim back your old house and the bulk of the gold, leaving the other side high and dry after they helped extract it in the first place. 
It won't go down well, in the same way in a marriage you share things, a union does the same thing.

I am not saying it's a direct comparison but there is nothing to suggest a clear cut, 'I take all this' scenario. Breaking up a union of this calibre will take a LONG time and a huge amount of recourses, there will be arguments and debates for years over who gets what.

What if the vote brings up several constituents along the boarder who want to remain in the UK? Are they forced to join Scotland against their will? What if the Shetlands or Orkneys want to remain in the UK?

Scotland leaving wouldn't really damage the UK, Scotland does have a fair few natural reserves, but the UK has discovered a much bigger pool if we are to use fracking. The reserves in the North Sea will be unlikely to be fully Scotland's in the first place. So there's to me no benefit of resources for Scotland going independent.

Secondly, the notion of economics and trade. Scotland relies heavily on funding from the UK to have things like free universities and pharmaceuticals, with only 5 million people living there, and even less in the higher tax brackets, how would Scotland afford these measures? Simply put, it couldn't. Talking of universities, it could severely limit the amount of students who go to, when it comes to the higher end at any rate. Scotland only really has St Andrews (pretty tiny) and Edinburgh anywhere close to the top of the tables.Whilst SNP leaders mainly went to Scottish universities, a fair few of them such as Blair went to Oxford.

You need a big population to be properly heard, because you actually have something to bargin with. Once Scotland breaks off they lose that power, why do you think the UK, France and Germany have the most influence in Europe? Population and stability.

Saying 'all say' was hyperbole, it's just a style of writing used frequently in the UK and is not supposed to be taken literally, I apologise if that is what caused the confusion.

I was merely trying to say Scotland will lose a lot of influence, in the EU, NATO, UN and generally across the globe.

L'incazzatura mi e' venuta in una seconda fase, quando ho visto che qua, negli Stati Uniti, e' possibile avere la patente, lo stesso giorno del test, senza prendere appuntamento; le instituzioni rispondono alle emails; il tuo medico risponde alle emails; la giustizia (senza andare nei particolari) funziona meglio che da noi; i muri delle citta', specialmente nei centri turistici non sono ricoperti di graffiti; esiste una meritocrazia... e altre cosucce.

Passata l'euforia della novita' ho iniziato ad incazzarmi con il Paese dove vivo adesso...specialmente per la sanita', tutti sanno com'e' la sanita' negli Stati Uniti e per il fatto che tutto e' un business.

Non esiste Paese perfetto, anche io come molti hanno scritto amo l'Italia ma odio la mentalita' dell'italiano. La mentalita' del furbo, del parcheggiatore in doppia fila o negli spazi riservati ai disabili, di chi salta la fila ecc..., ma soprattutto odio la burocrazia e la politica italiana.

L'ho scritto molte volte su altri post, ho viaggiato in tanti Paesi europei, nei Caraibi ed indirettamente conosco la situazione in America Latina; sono fermamente convinto che l'Italia potrebbe essere il Paese piu' bello al mondo.

Saro' scontato ma l'arte, il cibo, i paesaggi che abbiamo non ci sono in altri posti al mondo. Ma la nostra Italia e' stata distrutta, depredata dall'interno per decenni, al punto che stiamo andando a fondo, abbiamo l'acqua al mento e respiriamo con una cannuccia.

&gt; questo è però un falso argomento. Anche gli omicidi o i furti ""avvengono comunque"".

Trovo che la tua associazione tra prostituzione e omicidi\furti sia forzatissima e scorretta. Omicidi e furti sono reati con vittime, qualcuno viene danneggiato. La prostituzione non danneggia nessuno, tranne se la donna non è consenziente ed è forzata a farlo: cosa che deriva spesso dal fatto che la prostituzione è illegale, e viene quindi effettuata in maniere ancora più illegali, violente e brutali, portando soldi alle mafie e ai criminali.

Secondo me la prostituzione *forzata* è degradante per la donna. Se una donna vuole prostituirsi per denaro, o perché le piace il sesso, chi siamo noi per giudicarla e dirle che non può farlo? Certo, se va a danneggiare qualcuno o rompere le palle in mezzo alla strada, sono d'accordo che sia illegale. Ma se non danneggia nessuno, che male c'è?

La prostituzione avviene comunque. Può avvenire in due modi: o dando soldi alla mafia e picchiando le donne costringendole a prostituirsi, o dando soldi allo Stato attraverso le tasse e riducendo il numero di donne forzate a prostituirsi (certo, non mi illudo che la prostituzione illegale scompaia legalizzandola)

The idea that independence can be achieved by a 40 % of all eligible voters is rediculous. If people really want independence they will vote for it, otherwise the blanks should be considered a 'no' vote. It should be mentioned that they are considering bringing the vote to those would not otherwise vote such as the elderly by allowing certain groups of people to vote from their homes. This is a good thing since I firmly believe that people have the right to vote for such an issue. I hope people are informed about it.

Then there are the post-independence issues. If there is another 'no' how long until the next one? Should we be doing this every 20 years or so? Eventually there might be a 'yes', such as now. What do we do then? Can we have another referendum to get back into the union in 20 years if we don't like it? Will England allow for that?

If I voted 'no' this time and the referendum is won by the 'yes' block, don't I have the right to vote at a later date to get back into the union? Why should all these 'yes' voters get several attempts, yet those referendums end when I am suddenly in the 'minority' for the first time? Declining my wish to vote to get back into the UK is undemocratic.

IMO all thise nonsense has mostly to do with people getting sucked into nationalism and scottish exceptionalism (this phrase is a sad joke). Scotland is filled with fat people. It is a relatively poor country. I live in Norway atm and the difference between here and Scotland is huge. Scotland, like Ireland, should realise they don't have endless money. The Irish found that out the hard way, I guess Scotland must too.

Almeno qui hanno l'abitudine di dare la colpa agli altri e l'Ansaldo è un easy target. Ma ci sono altri lati della storia come il fatto che Belgio e Olanda entrambi in fase di tagli di budget si sono ritrovati con un progetto costato uno sproposito del quale non erano completamente (Belgio) convinti. Appena hanno potuto si sono tirati indietro usando l'episodio accaduto con la neve.

Ce qui est sur, c'est que **cette loi à été créée pour de mauvaises raisons**. Mais voilà on s'en fout parceque ce qui importe comme je l'ai ecrit plus haut c'est **est-ce qu'elle est juste?**. Il rappelle aussi à quel point la loi est inappliquée, ça c'est très grave, en particulier le ""stage citoyenneté"" qui n'est jamais exigé...

L'auteur du blog des le debut s'empresse de dire à peu près la même chose que mon premier post en déclarant qu'il faut s'attaquer au cœur du problème et pas aux symptômes quand on voit se qui se passe a Trappes et les femmes en Nicab aggressées en... supprimant la loi! Bim c'est l'inverse! Supprimer la loi c'est caresser tout le monde dans le sens du poil en attendant le prochain problème lié à la religion, à la police et/ou aux banlieues. Supprimer la loi, c'est un cache misère, c'est tout, c'est quand même evident ça ne résoud aucun problème.

C'est festival sur de nombreux points:

* la population musulmane se sent stigmatisée. C'est très bien, faut surtout pas empecher ça, je souhaite que toute personne et tout groupe qui pratique la discrimination soit stigmatisé par des lois. Quiconque propage des idées discriminatoires doit être stigmatisé et montré du doigt.

* la France a été condamné par le comité des droits de l'homme, pour imposer les photos d'identité sans rien sur la tête et les expulsions de personnes portant un foulard au lycée. La France fait preuve de fermeté sur une pratique discriminatoire et se fait épingler par les droits de l'homme...c'est n'importe quoi. Et le premier commentaire du blog est vraiment bien à se sujet, il fait la démonstration que les institutions des droits de l'homme international sont très loin d'être laïc, et ne vont pas accordé les mêmes droits aux nudistes ou à un groupe religieux (pour reprendre mon exemple!), c'est lamentable.

* la loi a été appliquée à 423 personnes seulement donc c'est inutile. Le nombre de personne pour qui s'applique une loi n'a rien a voir avec si elle est juste ou pas.

Je ne nierai pas que cette loi a été faite pour de mauvaise raisons dans un climat politique raciste du gouvernement Sarko. Mais est-elle juste? Oui absolument.

The problem with the progressives and liberals is that they support ideas of freedom, rights and expression. They are also strongly in favor of fair treatment of minorities. Muslims are a minority. Many liberals support Islam as a means to empower the Muslim minority. They forego the realization that the ideology carried by the vast majority of Muslims here, is strongly conservative, and opposes the views of the liberals themselves. We liberals should speak out against Islam, and say that it's not OK to force your wives and daughters to cover their face and bodies, that it's not OK to harass and hurt homo's and that it's not OK to resort to violence if things don't go your way.

e non devi conoscerla, la mia situazione, perché si tratta di una preferenza personale, e in quanto tale è soggettiva. Non devo stare a spiegarti che quello che per me è un lavoro di merda per qualcun'altro è un lavoro da sogno. Rimane il fatto che per me lo è un lavoro di merda  e nella vita reale preferirei fare altro. Quindi lo Stato dovrebbe renderlo illegale.

Tecnicamente è un fallimento dello stato **Italiano** l'avermi fatto emigrare all'estero. Perché? Perché lo Stato Italiano ha fatto per decenni esattamente quello che tu ritieni sia la soluzione ai problemi di tutti. Più Stato, più Stato per aiutare te, per aiutare me, per aiutare noi, per aiutare voi e per prendercela in quel posto perché nel farlo si è indebitato oltre le propria possibilità di ripagare i debiti. 

Siamo tutti più poveri perché qualcuno ha avuto la presunzione di conoscere la ricetta per farci diventare tutti ricchi.

&gt; Di certo non garantirebbe ai magnaccia un introito maggiore.

Ma sono proprio i magnaccia che verrebbero tolti dai piedi perché non potrebbero più costringere nessuno a lavorare contro voglia. Se si agisce nella legalità non c'è più il timore di denunciare chi ti costringe a fare qualcosa. Con questo non voglio dire che scomparirebbero completamente perché è impossibile ma certo ce ne sarebbero meno. 

Puoi usare come parallelo gli spacciatori nei paesi dove le droghe leggere sono state legalizzate. Tolti gli introiti dalla marijuana si sono dovuti spostare su quelle pesanti con un aumento del rischio. Il risultato è stata una diminuzione del numero degli spacciatori e un aumento di prezzo (e accessibilità) delle droghe pesanti. Nella prostituzione non c'è quella pesante o quella leggera, e i magnaccia non avrebbero più tanto ragion d'essere, se non come società che pagherebbero regolarmente tasse ma la coercizione verrebbe drasticamente ridotta.

The real concern is that poorly thought out policy like this often leads to bad law with all sorts of unintended consequences. Very little modern material is as demeaning to women as the bible, and yet the education secretary recently sent a copy of that to every school.

A huge amount of the pornography industry is violent and exploitative and very few people would deny this point.

As a counter viewpoint, how can you invest in a part of the country that is currently (and has been for a while) arguing for independence. You'll lose that investment if they gain independence. 

Also, in regards to them contributing greatly to the economy.

That's a relatively new occurrence. Past 10 years or so, with the rise in oil prices. 

Before that, they've been a net loss. 

I think it's kinda cheeky that after a few years of prosperity they start ranting about how much of a drain the rest of the UK is and how much we're taking from them. 

Sure, in the past few years maybe. But what about the few hundred before that?!

Ipotizziamo che il guadagno è correlato allo sforzo. la prostituta guadagna più di uno spazzino. Molto di più. Ma allora uno spazzino\operaio non può permettersela. Allora ci sarà un giro illegale per permettere anche ai camionisti di scopare in santa pace a prezzi ridotti. Sfruttando le ragazze.

Ma è ovvio che non puoi debellare completamente dei comportamenti del genere, ci sono tanti esempio che posso usare per supportare 'sta tesi. La lotta alle droghe e al download illegale sono due esempi, ci sono delle leggi per fermarli ma non ovviamente non possono farlo del tutto.

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt; that '40% rule' seems very arbitrary. Why is it at 40%, and not for example 45, 50, or even 60%?

It was set as 40% because that was felt most likely to thwart the result without appearing too obvious.

The actual percentage of the electorate that voted yes turned out to be 33%, which is pretty typical for UK elections (Margaret Thatcher won the subsequent UK election, which was triggered by protests against the 40% rule, on 33% of the UK electorate).

&gt; Then there are the post-independence issues. If there is another 'no' how long until the next one? Should we be doing this every 20 years or so? Eventually there might be a 'yes', such as now. What do we do then? Can we have another referendum to get back into the union in 20 years if we don't like it? Will England allow for that?

Those are questions every country faces - even if you vote for something today, future generations may decide to do things differently. That's OK.

&gt; If I voted 'no' this time and the referendum is won by the 'yes' block, don't I have the right to vote at a later date to get back into the union? Why should all these 'yes' voters get several attempts, yet those referendums end when I am suddenly in the 'minority' for the first time? Declining my wish to vote to get back into the UK is undemocratic.

If you want to provide a party campaigning on those grounds then, sure, why not? If you can convince enough people to vote for you then you'll get your wish.

Personally I feel that Scotland would benefit more from a union with the rest of Europe than it would from the current union with the UK. No union is required to last forever.

It's worth noting that the structure of the devolved Scottish government was specifically designed to encourage coalitions, and to make a majority government hard to achieve. One of the architects of devolving power to Scotland did so because he believed it would ""kill independence stone dead"", and yet here we are - a centre-left party dedicated to independence has won the last two Scottish government elections, and won a majority in 2011.

&gt; IMO all thise nonsense has mostly to do with people getting sucked into nationalism and scottish exceptionalism (this phrase is a sad joke). Scotland is filled with fat people. It is a relatively poor country.

I disagree about the nationalism (IMO modern Scottish politics is simply driven by a wish for more progressive policies than the rest of the UK), but it is true that we have serious public health issues.

Both with diet, and with alcohol (we spend £3.6bn a year, in Scotland, on alcohol abuse alone). Those have been with us for quite some time, and the UK's current political structure has not made much headway in addressing them.

&gt; I live in Norway atm and the difference between here and Scotland is huge. Scotland, like Ireland, should realise they don't have endless money. The Irish found that out the hard way, I guess Scotland must too.
&gt;
&gt; Regardless, if Scotland does vote for independence, good luck. I shall not shed a tear should it all go to shit and Scotland becomes another toothless celtic tiger.

It's worth pointing out that for the last 25 years Scottish North Sea oil revenue has matched almost exactly the transfer payments Scotland has received from the rest of the UK. To put it another way, over that period Scotland's non-oil deficit, which was covered by the UK treasury, matched almost exactly with its oil revenue, which went to the UK treasury. If Scotland had been independent over that period, the only way it could have built up an oil fund would have been to cut taxes or otherwise improve how well the economy was run, which is of course a separate issue. Here are the figures:

true,Hilfe_kommt,BELG,Belgium,"Ha! I’ve been waiting for this day to come so I’ve prepared a little ELI5 on the political situation in Belgium. It’s actually more a ELI15 but anyone who has ever browsed that sub will know that almost no answer there can actually be used to explain the matter to a 5-year old. 


Here we go. So, probably everyone knows Belgium is divided in a dutch-speaking part in the north, called Flanders, and a French-speaking part in the South called Wallonia. This is illustrated on the following map: http://i.imgur.com/hb6QEMw.gif. Like you see: there is an area that doesn’t belong to one of the aforementioned regions, that’s Brussels. Brussels is officially bilingual French and Dutch. But it gets more complicated! A lot more obscure is the fact that Belgium also has an official German-speaking community, located in the east of the country: http://i.imgur.com/SN1iVoe.png.


That makes for some interesting political structures in Belgium. First of all, there is the federal government, that speaks for the country as a whole, but has received less and less responsibilities in some consecutive constitutional reforms since the seventies. Second there is the Flemish region. This is the level of government that decides about all the stuff related to the territory of Flanders, as seen in the first map. These responsibilities cover economy, employment, agriculture, water, housing, civil engineering, transport, environment, spatial planning,   nature conservation, foreign trade and control over the provinces and municipalities. Third: the region of Wallonia, exact same responsibilities like the Flemish one, but different geographical location. Warning, none of both regions have something to say about Brussels! Fourth, the Brussels capital region. This has more or less the same responsibilities as the other regions (there are some minor difference, but this is a ELI15). We learned that there are three official languages in Belgium so we’ve created different governments to protect them too. There we go, fifth: The Dutch-speaking community. You might argue that this is practically the same as the Flemish region, but this is not true. The responsibilities of this government center around the Dutch language: culture, education and all other language related questions. Note that this community also has sayings about Dutch-speaking people in Brussels. Sixth, the French-speaking community, which has the same powers. It covers Wallonia (except for the German-speaking part) and the French-speaking people of the capital? Seventh, the little German-speaking community.  


Conclusion. This is a very handy map that makes it entirely clear what all these regions and communities are about: http://i.imgur.com/t3ndHEb.png. Little sidenote: you might think that Belgium has seven governments, but that’s not true either. The Flemish region and community have merged their institutions and no act as one.  
  
There are more nifty things I can discuss, and I will on popular request. There was for example the fight about the electoral district surrounding Brussels, or communities in the middle of Belgium, where both Dutch and French are spoken. I could also elaborate on the biggest current party in Flanders, which is a separatist one. You ask, I deliver.

However this is my opinion on Naples:
1) Napoli is a hard city for Newbies. 
2) It can be considered beautiful, but it is also dangerous (end of story).
3) You are better served spending your time elsewhere. 

Doxep has a good point that you can go to Capri and the other islands, to the Cilento or to the costiera Amalfitana. Those are beautiful places, I strongly suggest to anybody visiting Italy, but I also always suggest to avoid Naples. 

To add to this, you might want to see TripAdvisor's opinion on Naples (find it [here](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g187785-s206/Naples:Italy:Health.And.Safety.html))

For those offended that I tell foreigners to avoid Naples, please be realistic. Naples is not friendly to tourists, its not safe and its ""the essence of chaos.""

FYI there is not ONE newspaper or major newsoutlet which is not controlled by a state or media conglomerate one way or the other.

Des accusations que le ministre a vivement rejetées, prenant la défense des forces de l'ordre et des élus locaux.*

In order to get a visa in Spain you have to go to the consulate office in your home country and apply for a student visa after you have already been accepted to the program. I'm writing a post about my student visa experience in an hour after I finish my lunch ( I'm currently in Spain and you don't eat lunch until 2 or 4) I just finished all of the paperwork for it since its a big process. If you dont want to wait then there is countless information online on the MAEC website. Anyways, in order to be in Spain for longer than 90 days legally you need a student visa. 

If you are looking for a spanish program in Barcelona and you don't want to spend a lot of money on it then look at the official language school of Barcelona. http://www.eoibd.cat/en/ most cities have these and they are cheaper than a private school but they also don't include much more than the course. The private schools will offer more assistance. 

I'm not sure what the cost of living is there but I would assume its the same or more than Madrid. A small tiny studio in Madrid costs 580€ minimum a month. I wouldn't be comfortable on 830€/month it would be really low for just one person in Barcelona. 

For the CELTA you wouldn't be able to get a student visa since most, if not all, CELTA programs are less than 90 days. 

Sorry for the rant if some of this seems confusing. There are a lot of paperwork and deadlines to meet.

Yes, because we really managed to stop the Iraq war with a million people protesting. And, now, it's even more of a PITA to organise legal protests.

Protesting doesn't do a damn thing and never has. Almost all social change is wrought through violence and illegal activity, from women getting the right to vote (suffragettes with bombs and firebombs) to gay rights (rioting, public 'lewdness' and having gay sex itself was a crime). 

There are always two aspects to a movement for social change - the 'extremists' who push the Overton Window further to their side through extreme rhetoric and illegality, and the 'moderates' who, once the 'extremists' have created awareness, perform the function of providing an acceptable compromise between the status quo and the 'extreme' desired outcome.",0,1374503276,null,0,false,0,cb7t3zi,t3_1iswg3,t1_cb7t3zi,t1_cb7raea,null,1430378933,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

It is no different to judge someone because of their color of their skin and their religion. Not everyone following a religion follows the same set of ideas. There may be a vague similarity in certain terms, but as you can see with all religions, there are vast differences in interpretation of these sets of ideas.

Just because I know someone is Jewish does not mean I know if he is strict orthodox or only culturally Jewish without really living his religion. Same goes for Islam. You cannot judge someone because of his religion, as religions are too broad sets of ideas. Therefore, members of religions are too heterogenous groups to make sweeping statements about them. Like people with different skin colors are too broad groups to make sweeping statements about them.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; It's worth pointing that the payments from ""the rest of the UK"" also includes Scotland… we do have to pay tax here too. :) Oil currently makes up about 18% of public sector revenue in Scotland (about £10bn per year), with comparable amounts coming from Income Tax, VAT, and NI payments.

The figures take that into account, it's a historical comparison between Scotland's non-oil deficit relative to the rest of the UK, and Scotland's geographical share of North Sea oil revenues. The deficit is exactly UK government taxation in Scotland measured against UK government expenditure in Scotland.

&gt; The problem with looking back at the past for what-ifs is that you can pick the data to suit your case

I thought I was responding to a historical what-if, to be honest! On re-reading, you don't actually say that, but it was surely your implication, i.e. that under other circumstances Scotland would now have a Norwegian-style oil fund.

&gt; if Scotland had been independent for the last 25 years, how likely is it that they would have purchased Trident? Or participated in Afghanistan/Iraq? Both of those have been extremely expensive projects (£2bn annual maintenance for Trident, £40bn for Afghanistan alone), but neither sound like the kind of thing a nation of 5 million would (or could) do.

Well, Scotland's share of £40bn in Afghanistan was £4bn, or £200m a year for Trident, that's not outrageous for a nation of 5 million to spend. I suspect if you look at the cost of, say, Denmark's deployment to Afghanistan, you'll find similar figures. But, yeah, under different circumstances that money might have been unspent, hence what I was saying about economic management. The question is about whether the country could be better run if it was independent, and not really about a guarantee of increased revenue, or indeed a moral question about Scotland being shafted by the rest of the country.

Il y a 3 médias de téléchargement ""illégaux"" très satisfaisants (et considérés sûrs - en tous cas tu ne recevras pas de courrier d'Hadopi) :

* les trackers privés : il s'agit toujours de torrent, mais pas de tracket public (comme TPB). http://what.cd pour la musique, http://passthepopcorn.me pour les films et http://tvtorrents.com pour les séries. Il faut beaucoup seeder pour conserver son compte (conserver un bon ratio), une seedbox peut donc être une bonne idée. C'est bien 100% P2P.

* [les newsgroups](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet). Il s'agit d'un protocole de forums antérieur au web, et qui connaît depuis 10 ans un regain d'intérêt pour le téléchargement. Je crois qu'il faut également payer pour accéder aux serveurs proposant ces téléchargements. Il y a du P2P dans la réplication et la mise à jour des serveurs de news (synchronisation des messages etc.), mais pas pour le consommateur. Tu as peut-être déjà entendu parler de [NZB](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/NZB) : il s'agit de l'en-tête d'un message sur usenet, et sert à ne pas télécharger le dit message (car il contient le fichier, volumineux).

* [XDCC](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDCC), un système reposant sur IRC qui permet de faire des requêtes de téléchargement. Ce n'est pas du P2P. C'est simple et ça marche bien.

Si tu veux avoir vraiment une belle chaîne, au bout tu peux utiliser des logiciels comme [CouchPotato](https://couchpota.to/) pour automatiser le téléchargement des films, [Sickbeard](http://sickbeard.com/) pour les séries et [Headphones](https://github.com/rembo10/headphones) pour la musique. Ils fonctionnent aussi bien avec des trackers (torrent, premier point) que des groupes de discussion (usenet, second point) que je sache. Tu peux suivre des artistes/séries/faire des wish list/choisir le format/la qualité/etc.

Pour configurer ces trois derniers logiciels, il te faudra soit renseigner ton compte sur un tracker torrent, soit un client newsgroup qui sera en mesure de chercher ce que tu veux dans les messages. Le plus connu pour cela est [SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/) je crois.

Tous les derniers logiciels évoqués sont de grande qualité. Cela vaut la peine de passer 1 ou 2 jours à tout configurer pour ensuite avec une belle chaîne d'accès aux contenus de ton choix.

When criticism of an idea is not racism, then it is indeed fine.  
No matter how stupid such criticism is.

***

Now, let me explain why I said ""partially"":

&gt; You cannot judge someone because of his religion, as religions are too broad sets of ideas. Therefore, members of religions are too heterogenous groups to make sweeping statements about them.

This is not entirely true.

No label is ""too broad"" as to lack a common denominator.

No. If this continent wants to stay prosperous and fare well against competition coming from the US, China and other developing economies, then we need to integrate the economy more.

Alcune cose su cui riflettere.

Dice che in Germania (popolazione 81.8 milioni) ci sono circa 200.000 prostitute (quindi una ogni 409 abitanti), mentre in Svezia (pop. 9.45 milioni) solo 1.000 / 1.500 (una ogni 6300). Una tale discrepanza mi suona un po' strana, ma potrei sbagliarmi io.

Poi ci sono un paio di passi chiave che andrebbero evidenziati, dove si parla dell'esperienza tedesca:

""To operate a mobile snack bar in Germany, one has to be in compliance with the DIN 10500/1 standard for ""Vending Vehicles for Perishable Food,"" which states, for example, that soap dispensers and disposable towels are required. A brothel operator is not subject to any such restrictions. All he or she has to do is report to authorities when the brothel is opened.""

""German law enforcement officers working in red-light districts complain that they are hardly able to gain access to brothels anymore.""

Siamo abituati a parlare e pensare male (e a ragione) dei politici e degli amministratori italiani, ma se e' vero quanto scritto sopra i loro omologhi tedeschi non sono da meno !

Come accidenti e' stato possibile che la liberalizzazione dei bordelli non sia stata accompagnata da alcuna normativa sulle condizioni minime che devono essere garantite dai gestori ?!

Per quale motivo per la polizia / gli ispettori sanitari / gli ispettori del lavoro / gli assistenti sociali adesso e' **piu'** difficile accedere ai bordelli di prima ?!

Vero, in alcune realtà la legalizzazione/regolamentazione è stata fatta male e ha permesso un incremento dello sfruttamento ma, citando il commento più votato, che esprime il mio pensiero

&gt;Credo che il problema non sia nella legalizzazione in sé, ma nel modo in cui si è deciso di regolarla. La prostituzione dovrebbe poter essere esercitata solo come attività autonoma e indipendente e non da subordinati/e. Strutture come i bordelli dovrebbero essere cooperative di chi vi esercita la professione, e non dovrebbe poterci essere qualcuno che assume le prostitute e dispone della loro attività.
Eventualmente le prostitute potrebbero avvalersi dei servizi di sicurezza o altro, ma sarebbe chi li offre a dipendere dalle prostitute e non viceversa.

&gt;Con una regolamentazione di questo tipo credo che sarebbe molto difficile per un pappone riuscire a scampare le accuse.

The same always happens when there's similar article about [Nordic country] even here in reddit. /u/biotech9 put it well and concisely in his top comment when this same article was posted in TrueReddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/1i37hg/finland_has_cheaper_medical_care_smarter_children/ 

That comment could be pretty much copypasted to any similar post about [Nordic country] and it would be a relevant summary of the discussion.

France has a long history of revolts and revolutions, and at the moment, our executive power is really weak, our police forces are weak, our army is weak, and there are lots of weapons in the wild.
