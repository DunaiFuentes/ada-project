But I went there some times for shopping and did find to be quite nice there. You are relativly close to Wesel which is the district town and the 2nd largest town around(60k citizens) before Duisburg (490 K) (Moers has about 105k btw)). The area itself is a mixture of industrialized and agricultural areas. The further you go south (Duisburg) the more you enter the Ruhrgebiet, the furter you go north it's more the Niederrhein, so the lower regions of the [Rhein](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niederrhein_%28Region%29). Depending on what you like I would chose the location for the apartment. I was doing Civilian Alternative Service in Xanten in a youth care station since there were no baracks nearby. Xanten is a very lovely town and I liked it very much there. It is big enough to have some bars and pups, supermakets and everything. But the town itself is very old. Very nice. I only went to Kalkar 3-4 times since I have no real reason to go there. Its very rural and I can't tell you much about it. I don't know how much spare time you will have or where you like to spent it. Duisburg as some dance clubs, a lot of pups (e.g. Duisburg [Innenhafen](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innenhafen_Duisburg) and bars but you won't find much else around the smaller towns. Maybe some bars or diners. So thats it, if you have some more specific questions feel free to ask. I'll try my very best to answer those. Excuse me for bad english ;-)

The English are right in exactly one way: A warm breakfast is perfectly acceptable. And by that I don't mean burning your hands on hot rolls (though that's fine, too), but preparing the whole thing in a pan or on a grill. You of course need to replace English emulsified offal tubes with actual sausages, but in general, a full English breakfast is just right... though that may not be immediately apparent to the Kellog's-masses.

Bauernfrühstück has nearly the same essential ingredients as full English. Basically, replace tomato with pickles (but there's actually no need to), beans with more potato or anything you put in squeak, I'm partial to mushrooms in general so you can leave them out, and last, but not least, scramble the eggs in the same pan as the rest.

Well, I *do* consider a proper baguette that doesn't last more than half a day a piece of art. Our bread rolls aren't any more durable, either... with the difference that the baguette usually becomes inedible after that time, whereas bread rolls are still fit for consumption.

I personally prefer more precise criticisms — any ""-archy"" has the connotation of a *deliberate* structure of oppression, that people elect to be part of, but I suspect that the reality is much more nuanced. Most people do not *want* to oppress women, or gays, or racial minorities, or men, for that matter — but they inadvertently end up doing so out of ignorance, namely lack of reflection upon some basic tendencies (for instance, why is it always worse to be feminine than to be masculine? Sure, tomboy girls may not have an easy time, but they're still kind of cool, whereas girly boys never are).

Similarly, it's really easy to inadvertently reproduce marginalising effects when one hasn't felt those effects on one's own self — for example, make-me-a-sandwich jokes may be innocuous, but too many of them, and a general atmosphere of having to prove yourself as a woman, can demotivate women from pursuing certain careers.

All the social pressure, and most of the spoils that comes with it, is still discriminatory is society. There is still an expectation that men are the ones with big careers while women have the option of a career. That is still arguably a patriarchy though goodness knows what you do about it.

The real key to understanding it though is both genders enforce this system. It isn't an ""evil men and oppressed women"" situation. It is a strange society where both genders are culpable for the situation.

I'm not saying I necessarily agree this is a problem but I can understand the argument. It isn't technically wrong and is worth discussion.

No, it's in the interest of the fishermen to catch as much as possible. In addition, why would there be a difference between management on state size or continent size? If anything, a continent size framework would reduce the fear of competition from other countries.

&gt;The problem comes when there are cross interests from multiple countries.

Which can only be solved by coordinating between those countries, for which we have the EU.

&gt;Of course the UK will implement its own regulations.

But you've got no clue whether those will be better or more effective. You're just arguing from the sentiment that your country must be better than others.

&gt;Potential poachers are easy, because they're poachers and they're now illegal.

As they are now. I was using poachers metaphorically: when the fishing policy is fractured again, the pressure on fishermen to catch all the can will only rise, because apart from competition between firms you also get competition between laws. Every country will be pressured to allow lax laws, out of fear that someone might beat them to it. This dynamic is particularly intense in fishing because while ships might respect territorial waters, fish don't.

&gt;Fuck off, you 'lazy-argument' idiot. Of course its perfectly rational

Cursing and invoking rationality in the next sentence? Ha.

&gt;Of course its perfectly rational to say that the Spanish fleet which more than doubled the scale of fishing in the UK being removed would help the fishes grow.

No, that is if you *only* think of a Tobin tax as a tax, with no implications and no purpose.  However, it isn't. As I am sure you know, one of the many purposes with the Tobin tax is not just to raise money but to (for example) curb the robot trading (that is what we call it in Swedish, sorry do not know the English name). Another reason is to try to tax undertaxed business, banks and financial institutes. 

Thus, if those countries *do* want to start getting more money from banks and financial institutes, why don't they start with doing a proper bank save. If you compare it to the Swedish bank save in the 90's who is generally seen as a very good save, you should know that while Sweden paid 3-4 % of their GDP to save their banks, they also demanded collateral, and changed the rules for the banks. Ergo - Swedish banks know that while they might survive, they will loose ownership. Also, in the end, selling all those shares back, + being owner of Nordea actually paid all the money from the bank save back, + then some. Why, if the Euro countries are truly interested in getting money back, and actually ""domsticating"" their banks, for real, haven't they done that? Nothing is stopping them. Why?

1. As much as I am generally in favour of the EU, it is crucial that we maintain constant scrutiny of its budgets as well as a high level of transparency. In other words, good job on the report.

2. Some of the criticisms are rather unwarranted. For instance, ""Europarl TV"" — it's an expense, and it has few viewers, but its purpose is precisely transparency and information of the public. The fact that the public doesn't seem to want to be informed is irrelevant — it's still a good thing, democratically, to have access to this information. Travel costs are also rather necessary when you're managing an empi… a union this size.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;No, it's in the interest of the fishermen to catch as much as possible.

I've already provided a link with the fishermen in question saying the EXACT opposite, saying it's in the interest to nurture the stock and to return living fish back into the waters.  There's even a video with a fishermen saying that it used to be a matter of pride throwing young fish back because they knew they were looking out for next year and generations to come.

You're doing it again.  You're not thinking things through.

&gt;In addition, why would there be a difference between management on state size or continent size? If anything, a continent size framework would reduce the fear of competition from other countries.

Because it would be British waters.  There would be no other people coming into their own waters.  They can compete in the single market, fine.  The CFP is managing its stocks terribly and the rest of the EU fleet would have less to fish in.  Being an island the UK walks away with a much bigger share.

Again, it's WIN-WIN for the UK to walk from the CFP!

&gt;Which can only be solved by coordinating between those countries, for which we have the EU.

AGAIN you didn't think through what you just said.  

You just said the only way to stop a breakdown in opinion between countries on how British waters are fished is if the UK goes through the EU.  Clearly it's wrong.  There's another option.   Do what Iceland and Norway manages to do, protect their own waters by not being in the CFP.

&gt;But you've got no clue whether those will be better or more effective. You're just arguing from the sentiment that your country must be better than others.

AGAIN you don't think it through.

No clue?  I just linked to ecologists, economists, conservationists, professional fishermen all calling for the same thing.  Even the CFP say that what they're doing isn't working but they can't get the changes through that the UK is calling for.

&gt;As they are now. I was using poachers metaphorically

Quota hopping is easy to deal with now?  I wish you'd tell the CFP that because even they say it is currently a problem.

&gt;when the fishing policy is fractured again, the pressure on fishermen to catch all the can will only rise,

You just made that bit up again as well.  It's becoming clear you've not actually read up on this particular subject matter.  Nobody is arguing for zero regulation and zero quotas, in some cases the fishermen themselves are actually asking for more but the CFP is blocking it!

&gt;This dynamic is particularly intense in fishing because while ships might respect territorial waters, fish don't.

Oh lordy, but I'm sure of having tens of thousands of square miles out at sea being managed not by the failing CFP, is going to give the failing fish stocks and damn better chance, for both fish and industry!

&gt;Cursing and invoking rationality in the next sentence? Ha.

Cursing is not irrational.  Grow up.

&gt;As if English firms wouldn't have big boats. As if the big boats of Spain wouldn't catch fish tagged as English.

true,HansAdler,null,null,"Very real problem. I have lived both in England and in Germany with my daughter, and I can confirm that the attitude is totally different.

The OFSTED reports for English nurseries complain about things like power sockets without an additional protection. Given how safe English power sockets are out of the box, this is insane. My daughter's nursery theoretically had a security process for visitors as if they were handling gold bars or bird flu viruses. (Of course in practice they didn't actually store the passport of everyone they didn't know as a parent, and *did* let my daughter go with my mother even though they didn't have her signature. It didn't occur to them to check.) I have never seen anything like that in Germany.

German children are 1-2 years older than English children when they start going to school. For the first 3 months or so they are supposed to be accompanied. After that, they are supposed to go alone. In many places the parents get a copy of the relevant part of the city map with the proposed path to school clearly marked. The city is supposed to make sure that there are zebra crossings at all dangerous points on these paths, and that they don't get obstructed by construction work. At the appropriate times you can observe how the groups of schoolchildren get larger and larger as they approach their school.

Of course drivers know about this and unless they are insane they are a bit more careful. The time when young children go to school is after workers go to work and before people with an office job are driving madly around looking for space for their cars.

My daughter goes to elementary school in a big German city. I am not the least bit worried about her so long as she doesn't use a scooter, as some of the 7- and 8-year-olds do. That's dangerous because simultaneously rolling fast, joking with friends and taking care of the traffic on the street they are going to cross is too much for them at this age.

Once my daughter met an exhibitionist on her way to school (first form, age 6). That wasn't the end of the world, either. She was walking alone at that point, he came on a bicycle and showed his private parts to her before cycling off. She was not the least bit concerned and only mentioned it at school when the teacher asked about it specifically after some other girls reported similar experiences on the same day.

What she was concerned about, however, was the paranoid woman who regularly talks to the groups of children who are walking unaccompanied every day after noon from the school to the after-school care club. The woman accuses them of being part of a plot against her, and swears at them because they are evil. My daughter is slightly scared by that (I guess the woman also intrudes into the children's physical sphere), so she tries not to walk alone at that time.

Now my daughter has a relatively long school path in a really big city. I never had any experiences like that as a child, and neither did my brother. And I have never personally heard of any serious accident on the school path.

However, I disagree with the blogger's interpretation that the traffic situation in the UK is to blame. In my experience that's fine. The difference is in the general attitude to children, responsibility and risk, and in the different kinds of housing. Germans live much denser on average, so school paths are shorter and less lonely. (And of course once children stop walking to school, you get into a vicious circle regarding loneliness.)",0,1358938014,null,0,false,0,c821dwb,t3_1732xu,t1_c821dwb,t3_1732xu,null,1435639586,18,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,18

I agree. I have already been referred to as a ""free rider"" in this thread.......We don't even have the Euro, and we have being net payers to the EU since we joined. 

The biggest problem to me is, that it seems to be the same people who don't want to deal with the root of the problem or the democratic deficit that is currently plaguing Europe. 

The Euro is incorrectly constructed from the beginning. Having a one currency is certainly not wrong in itself, but if you want that, you need to change the way it is constructed, have proper permanent transfers etc. However, no one wants to fix that, because then the stupid people would have to vote for it, and the same stupid people would probably vote no.

The hotnews article states clearly that while this was in the initial proposal for the new law, it was modified in the final form:

Biroul permanent al Camerei respective transmite sesizarea deputatului sau senatorului aflat in aceasta situatie si comisiei care are in competenta analizarea situatiilor de incompatibilitate in vederea elaborarii unui raport, in termen de 15 zile. In cazul in care din raportul comisiei reiese existenta unei stari de incompatibilitate, Biroul permanent al Camerei sau Senatului, informeaza deputatul sau senatorul, care are obligatia ca in termen de 30 de zile sa opteze intre calitatea de deputat sau de senator si functia sau functiile incompatibile"".

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;I've already provided a link with the fishermen in question saying the EXACT opposite, saying it's in the interest to nurture the stock and to return living fish back into the waters.

Of course it's no more than sensible to manage the catch in a sustainable way. The thing is that fisheries are commercial firms and only want to catch more to sell more to profit more. Fishers in general have been opposed to catch restrictions of any kind, and the fear of being saddled with restrictions in their country while other countries didn't have those would only intensify their opposition. 

Luckily they are coming to terms with the fact that no fish means no fishermen, but it's a process that takes time.

&gt;Because it would be British waters.

... and the fish turn back at the border?

&gt;You just said the only way to stop a breakdown in opinion between countries on how British waters are fished is if the UK goes through the EU. Clearly it's wrong. There's another option. Do what Iceland and Norway manages to do, protect their own waters by not being in the CFP.

No, you said that the problems come when their are cross interests of different countries. That means you have to balance those. Splitting the waters up will only make the country differences more important... not to mention you're still have cross interests of different companies. Or are you going to sell pieces of sea to different companies for their exclusive use?

And why would the fishing policy of known whale hunters be more responsible?

&gt;No clue? I just linked to ecologists, economists, conservationists, professional fishermen all calling for the same thing. Even the CFP say that what they're doing isn't working but they can't get the changes through that the UK is calling for.

The UK mostly cares to pander to the anti-EU sentiment, but is always the first to hinder European initiatives that might address problems. For example, the CFP is not seriously enforced by the UK: 90% of infringements are not pursued but come off with a warning.

&gt;Quota hopping is easy to deal with now? I wish you'd tell the CFP that because even they say it is currently a problem.

Don't put words in my mouth.

&gt;You just made that bit up again as well. It's becoming clear you've not actually read up on this particular subject matter. Nobody is arguing for zero regulation and zero quotas, in some cases the fishermen themselves are actually asking for more but the CFP is blocking it!

No, the other fishing companies and the politicians of their country they can pressure by threatening with unemployment are blocking it. The CFP is just the current compromise, and as opposed to your conspiracy theory is not a malevolent entity that exists to wreck fishing and the UK in particular.

&gt;Oh lordy, but I'm sure of having tens of thousands of square miles out at sea being managed not by the failing CFP, is going to give the failing fish stocks and damn better chance, for both fish and industry!

We can agree that the current CFP and its enforcement is inadequate. The difference is that you believe that it can't improve and that a separate UK policy is automatically better; I don't. For example, UK fishing stocks have been declining consistently during the last century, long before the CFP.

&gt;Cursing is not irrational. Grow up.

It just indicates how emotionally committed you are to the subject.",0,1358940433,null,0,false,0,c821mve,t3_16zhik,t1_c821mve,t1_c82183n,null,1431052370,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You complain that the EU is not democratic, but at the same time complain that your country can't dictate EU policy because they happen to be a net contributor. Try to be consistent.

&gt;What it means for those leaving is that they can afford to provide everything the Union did before and still have more money.

Only if you think the benefits of the union are limited to money transfers.

&gt;I demand to be treated, or rather the UK is treated, with the very best deal it can achieve. If that's better than everyone else like the French are better with the CAP, or like the German exports have done better out of the single currency, then yes - I want better.

You really can't stand that other people benefit from something, do you? At least the French and the Germans are committed to make the union work. Maybe you should adopt their strategy then, if it's so advantageous.

&gt;It's actually competition, not homogeneity, that allows the bar for the whole to be raised. Damn right I argue for competitive edge.

Except in the case of fisheries, then you'd rather stop competition by pulling up borders again.

&gt;Nah, not so much. I simply said the UK had moved faster and manoeuvred itself into a place where it can legally and morally block any ratcheting of powers written into the Lisbon Treaty, effectively giving it leverage.

There are plenty of provisions in the Treaty that ensure that things can't be enforced without discussion... on demand and with agreement of everyone, not just the UK. No, you're not the lone white knight. You're just one of the gray peasants, like everyone else.

Also, stop arguing from general morality. It's childish. I'm good! You're evil!

If you are not German, try to see it this way: Germany is a modern, developed nation just like any other in the west, quite comparable with the USA. So, imagine you are in your twenties (maybe you are). You listen to the same music we do. Eminem, Rihanna, Bruno Mars...and you watch the same movies we do (or rather vice-versa). You could be very well a German right now.

Now the key point: Do you feel responsible for WW2 right now? Probably not. The people back then...their clothing, their look even the way they spoke is VERY foreign to a normal young German. And was foreign to his parents too.

Yet we still didn't invade Poland again nor ever plan to. The common opinion here is that EVERY war regardless where is wrong. Period. Not because we feel ashamed or guilty for WW2 and Hitler, but because this is what every educated westerner should think about war.

Such authorization shall not be required in the case of a serious crime or other major offence committed flagrante delicto or when a conviction has become final.

German basic law:

punishable offence without permission of the Bundestag,
unless he is apprehended while committing the offence or
in the course of the following day.

any other restriction of a Member’s freedom of the person

Article 18.

There's a trend in the Conservative party; a world view that they are becoming fixated on; and that is that there's a race between China and the West.

Having 50 (counting some governments not speaking with a single voice) different opinions does not result in nice debates, but hard, **painful** compromises for everyone. Just remember the debate around the *constitution* a few years back. The catholics wanted a reference to good, the French had a need to export Laïcité to everyone. And a hundred further cultural conflicts, plus the question about money and power. The out coming result was rejected by several referendums and I cannot blame those voters.

Every European compromise was and is an outcome where everyone *can live with*, but nothing suitable to win the hearts of the masses. For a campaign you need an idealistic view - a **promise** rather then the final result. I do not see any lying in this: If you are a candidate for any official position (anywhere in the world) you are allowed to make those promises (e.g. Obama's change). No one expects you to write letter by letter every law in advance, and then the people decide, if they  like it or not. Most candidates keep their visions from the campaigns, and still need to find a compromise with certain constrains such as reality. 

Therefore: If Britain true-fully wants to stay in a Union. Ask your people in a referendum. Do you want to stay in the Union and do you want to authorise the government to do everything in their power to change certain aspects of the Union. Not the other way round. A british government that is waiting for an approval afterwards lacks every legimitation to negotiate anything.

&gt;The IMF confirmed its involvement – which is significantly less that the one-third it has contributed to previous eurozone bail-outs – at a board meeting on Thursday night

&gt;The rest of the money will come from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which is made up of contributions from the eurozone's national governments.

&gt;Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, said that the emergency loans, which will be disbursed in stages from now until 2014, would help the country meet its austerity promises “while remaining in the eurozone”.

&gt;“Risks to the programme remain exceptionally high, and there is no room for slippages,” Lagarde warned.

&gt;The IMF approval is the last step in the tortuous negotiations to secure a rescue for Greece, which is necessary for the country to avoid default when it makes a scheduled debt repayment on Tuesday (20 March).

&gt;Despite preliminary approval by leaders of eurozone member states at their summit on 26 October, national governments gave their formal green light only on Wednesday (14 March) after receiving guarantees that Greece was implementing austerity measures which are a condition of the financial support.

I think that's pretty clear, it's because a single currency can apparently only work with a higher level of fiscal integration than Britain wants to concede. Many serious economists only believe that it will work with major fiscal transfers from rich to poor areas, which would be completely unacceptable to many countries. Britain wouldn't even want to sign up to the fiscal pact, and give away control over its domestic budget. And that may not be enough to keep the system stable.

From my perspective, the Euro has been accepted on the basis of its benefits, and then the drawbacks have only come into focus after the decision was already made. Europe seems to have signed up to a permanent recession, or integration at a pace far beyond what at least Britain, and I think many other countries would consider acceptable.

It's also a disaster for Britain, because the Eurozone makes a natural power bloc, and people will want to leverage it for full benefit, which unfortunately means a collision course with the British economy, and with British influence. Why not shift the single market into the Eurozone, or engage in further service integration only within the Eurozone? You would not expect Britain to be in favour of a dynamic which sets up these possibilities.

I am an individual with a brain, I know that if I work 70 hour weeks then my health will suffer.

With a fall in wage do you not think labour would move else where? Just as they did in the first place, moving to France to make more money?

As for your other point, sure any European can move to/live in/set up a business in any other country, but I think the concern is two fold:

1) The symbolism of a former head of state moving (maybe moving actually, this isn't clear) to another country to start a new business.

2) The timing of the move makes it appear to be of the same motive that Gerard Depardieu invoked by theatrically moving to Russia in response to the proposed 75% income tax.

South: Dialect - old fashion - More countryside then huge cities - very nice landscape - a lot to do outside - high living standards - high income - high costs

East: IMO Worse dialect - the young scene is growing a lot over there - a couple of crusted cities, many things to see (old things) - regular costs of living

North: Dialect - but also the region of the ""hochdeutsch"" which states the clearest German (origin in Hannover) - The Sea is close - living standards are good - it is colder than in the south east or west (about 2- 5°) - good party scene even if the north faces are more ""cold"" to new people they have a warm heart. 

West: Many cities - very good party scene, Cost of living are above the north but under the south - really friendly people (IMO - moved to west Germany from North Germany 6 month ago) ----

Berlin
Bremen
Hamburg
Stuttgart
Köln

*Perché voto PD?* 1) Perché è l'unico partito italiano strutturato, ""scalabile"", democratico, e non-personalistico. 2) Con tutti i difetti che ha al suo interno (vedi Bindi e altri personaggi...) è l'unico grande partito di centro-sinistra italiano 3) Apprezzo l'idea primarie. Ho partecipato a quelle per la scelta del candidato Pres. del Cons., votando Renzi sia al 1° che al 2° turno. Non ho fatto mancare il mio voto nemmeno alle primarie lombarde, votando Ambrosoli, il candidato più spendibile fra i 3 in lizza, contro un avversario come Maroni. Ho votato addirittura alle primarie parlamentari nel bel mezzo delle feste natalizie. 

Ammiro il fatto che - tra le macerie - il PD abbia risposto a questa domanda di partecipazione, forse è vero in ritardo rispetto ad altri paesi, ma unico in Italia.
Nonostante alla fine abbia vinto Bersani, avrà comunque il mio voto. Certo, ho in mente un PD diverso da quello attuale, più in stile Partito Democratico americano, o Labour inglese. Un PD che accetti serenamente il fallimento di alcune idee e ne porti avanti altre, più adatte alla società odierna. Un PD attento all'equità, alla giustizia sociale, ma allo stesso tempo aperto all'idea di libero mercato, abbandonando alcuni personaggi della sinistra conservatrice che ancora trovano posto tra le fila di questo partito (su tutti, il responsabile economico PD, Fassina). Un partito di sinistra moderno che non scenda a compromessi con la libertà dell'individuo, e che non disprezzi ricchezza e successo personale. Questo è essere di sinistra oggi, e credo che nel PD ancora non l'abbiano capito. 
Nonostante queste critiche avranno il mio voto, non vedo altre alternative e preferisco trovare rifugio in questo grande partito (l'unico), in attesa di tempi migliori.

Ho apprezzato l'esperienza di Monti al governo. Chiamato in una situazione di emergenza a risolvere problemi creati da altri, è riuscito in pochi mesi a sistemare il caos finanziario, e ha posto le basi ""tecniche"" perché un buon governo ""politico"" possa poi far ripartire il paese. Scusate se è poco. 

Altro motivo per il quale non possiamo che apprezzare l'operato di Monti, è quello di aver fatto capire all'Europa che ora ci siamo, abbiamo avuto qualche problemino, ma siamo pronti a ripartire. Credo nel progetto europeo e condizione necessaria perché un partito abbia il mio voto è che sia fortemente europeista (e il PD lo è).
Su queste basi e visti i numeri dei sondaggi, non mi sembra così improbabile una futura coalizione di governo PD+Monti, con riforme ed Europa al centro. Non sarebbe così male e non potrebbe che portare un po' di stabilità al Paese. Unico punto incerto? Diritti civili. Un asse PD e Monti non porterà nessun avanzamento su questi temi, che considero fondamentali. Motivo per il quale Monti non avrà mai il mio voto. Almeno il PD parla di un generico progetto di unioni civili in stile tedesco (sigh!). 

Da un PD al governo chiedo riforme per la crescita, rigore nei conti - continuare quindi con il percorso tracciato da Monti, per dimostrare agli altri paesi UE e agli investitori che siamo responsabili e non c'è nulla di cui temere - equità e giustizia sociale. Diritti civili estesi a TUTTI (ma come ho spiegato poco sopra, la vedo dura) e una nuova legge elettorale (favorevole a collegi uninominali doppio turno).

Questi i motivi. Non abbiamo molta scelta in Italia di questi tempi, a meno che non troviate piacere a ""farvi infinocchiare"" dai soliti personaggi con partiti-movimenti-aziende. Capi-popolo incapaci, senza alcuna idea di come risolvere i problemi sul tavolo e p-e-r-i-c-o-l-o-s-i.

true,apple_kicks,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Sounds more like a poltical move for the next election (after hearing more experts talk about it). Tories have lost some hard liners voters in polls to UKIP (very anti EU), and number of back benchers have been chasing for an exit. They both are putting pressure of the PM as party leader (esp with likes of Boris Johnson who's always suspected of trying to get back to main line politics). So Cameron has promised referendum if his party wins the next election, which i'm guessing is a hope it'll get them enough votes to escape a coalition gov. 

Also sounds like he'll only put forward a referendum if reforms are not made. I think these will go down to how some EU laws are more powerful than uk legislation (correct me if wrong). Which is why he talks about British Independence. Which sounds little bit like moaning we don't have more controlling power within a collective group because 'we're special'.

This is what I know why some Tories want to leave EU, excluding immigration laws. Recall hearing tories don't like it when someone loses a case of human rights in UK but then win it in under EU laws and therefore wins overall (which is why they want to replace the humans right act with bill of rights, to prevent this and trigger way to leave the EU). So say UK reforms lobbying laws and EU doesn't, the lobbyist will find way to get what they want by going to the EU instead (or the other way round). Also heard anger at agriculture/fishing regulation in EU works against UK farmers rather than help (not sure if right or wrong, needs fact check). So they see some policies from EU as one size fits all, when in fact it benefits other countires more than others. So maybe they want more powers to abstain from EU laws.

This could be fixed if we had better represenatives in the EU and bigger public interest in what's being debated, but it seems at election time there is a poor turn out and a large number of protest votes. The only news you can get from EU is usually from those who dislike it alot. This is why i fear smaller parties like UKIP and tabloid papers will use the referendum as chance to print fear stories about immigration and destroy chance for real debate in how the EU should work good and bad. 

Labour people for EU are arguing this is wrong way to go about it. Say announcing this now will cause too much uncertainty and might affect business investment from Europe in next few years. They seem nervous so maybe worrying about losing votes, since some want a referendum but maybe not one which can cause an exit.

Se non hanno la soluzione ai problemi reali (e io non credo che l'abbiano) quantomeno fanno delle proposte, e non cercano di nascondere i problemi con frizzi e lazzi.

Despite some of the tremendous compromises that are made within the framework of the ESA to ensure the satisfaction of all partners (at the price of cost inefficiency and risk-aversion) I am extremely proud of Europe's independent launch capability and record of space exploration.  

While the EU and ESA will probably gravitate towards each other over the next decade, there seem to be some extreme barriers for a complete fusion.  The interests of the various groups involved are too divergent and as of this moment it seems unlikely that the ESA will be absorbed into the EU (where it would enjoy a spectacular increase in funding).

Finally, Europe's lack of independent manned spaceflight capability is another black eye for what very well could be the most capable space program on the planet.  If it ever does come, it will probably be in the form of Soyuz craft licensed for use by ESA.  While this would prove reliable and a ""safe"" option, it fails to capitalize on the potential of competitive commercial enterprise to really bring European space costs down.

No investment. No credit. Banks don't loan money, investors gtfo because of nasty economical conditions.

\*Hard to explain, the original ""recibos verdes"" were intended for independent workers (1-man business) to make it easier for them to pay taxes and whatnot.

Before I say anything else, the UK will not be leaving the EU in this decade.  The referendum, if it does come, will be carefully crafted to give the average Brit the greatest possible sense of decisive independence but will give no option when it comes to an actual departure from the Union.  Certainly there will be an opt-out from another mechanism to regulate financial trouble within the Union and especially the Eurozone but the people of the UK will not be given the option to flush their own benefits of membership down the toilet.  

This isn't really what interests me though.  More so I am fascinated by yet another threat from the UK which has been so characteristically twisted to have been called (in this thread of all places) a peace offering in the most generous sense.  It is not and should never be regular practice within EU politics to use the threat of flipping the table and spilling all the crayons about to get your own way at the expense of all others.  Believe it or not, I was naively optimistic enough regarding this speech to speculate on a UK offer to allow a tighter fiscal union if given a powerful oversight and control in its implementation.   No such chance.

As far as I know, no other nation within the EU uses the possibility of leaving the Union so regularly (or at all) as the UK does.  This has been a source, quite obviously, of much friction and a very powerful us vs. them mentality which has been fostered since even before the UK joined.  Had the UK been unwilling to allow for the relinquishment of sovereignty in many areas of government (workers rights, anyone?) I am honestly curious as to why the decision was made in the first place given the creeping integration of member states and the clear potential for expansion and consolidation.

&gt;He's not even ruling it the UK against the EU. He's invited effectively every country that has problems with certain issues with the EU to write their own shopping list based around the central core of the common market.

Mr.Cameron knows what's up.  This is a UK vs EU situation, no doubt about it.  What he needs to do is his absolute best to make it look like the EU is the ""big bad guy"" unwilling to compromise with the underdog when it is in fact overwhelmingly clear that a functional union requires individual nation states to subjugate their own national interests to the ""greater good"" and that a single state within this group throwing a hissy fit at every possible opportunity does not accurately represent the concept of ""compromise"" when it is a case of 1 vs 26.  26 compromising for 1 is a backwards world.  This I found particularly amusing about your diatribe, that from the other side of the channel it appears that the federalists are throwing a ""temper tantrum"" when it is in fact much more like a parent disappointed in what is looking more and more like a spoiled child.

Before today I was singularly dedicated to a rapprochement between these conflicting interests that would lead to a political maturing within the UK (so oddly uncomfortable with the idea of ceding sovereignty after having spent the last two centuries unilaterally corraling disparate territories under a centralized control mechanism) but today that opinion has changed.  The UK has shown it is incapable of approaching the table while leaving the emotion at home.  Observing UK TV covering the debate I notice a recurring trend, that the local man trying to keep his business afloat seems keenly aware that losing the benefits of the EU would be detrimental to *everyone* and he uses level-headed practical arguments in this regard, then there is the air-headed no-neck that can only conjure images of nationalism and ""pride"" to demonstrate why exactly the UK needs this privileged position within a Union of equals.  

An argument this important will and should not be decided by emotion and aged nationalistic fervor.  If only romantic, selfish notions can be called upon to justify this sort of movement then I firmly condemn it.  As mentioned before, today I changed my stance.  I am now comfortable with the idea of the UK leaving the Union cold-turkey.  I find that now the only way for the UK to learn the importance of working together to be forced to work alone, and suffer the consequences.  It is an illogical, emotional standpoint.  I have become so dreadfully tired of the eurosceptic crowd attacking the EU for all the wrong reasons (and pretending their form of ""negotiation"" is giving some sort of generous concession) that I finally think it should be time for them to actually experience their wet dream.  The EU will move towards further integration without the UK if necessary, and we will be stronger for it, and the UK will not.

&gt;People have been demanding that the UK steps up and takes a lead in forming the EU.
&gt;They asked for it.
&gt;This is it.

As a final reminder, having the UK threaten leaving (again!) is the exact opposite of ""taking a lead in forming the EU"", more like ""taking the lead in setting your country back a good 5-10 years minimum"".

No, there is *nothing* extra in IMF funding for **you**. Everything was part of the *regular* IMF procedure, which you were *obliged* to follow (**more on IMF membership later**).

First of all, you've got your [exchange rates mixed up](http://www.exchangerates.org.uk/GBP-EUR-exchange-rate-history.html). The amount is higher, more like £23bn. That's how high my ""anti-UK sentiment"" is, correcting you with a higher amount.

Second, the [£3.2bn bilateral loan to Ireland](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/int_loan_to_ireland.htm) is larger that what you paid for Greece through IMF.

IMF approved two loans for Greece, €58bn (£48bn) in total.

As you see, the UK paid *far less* for Greece through IMF (obligatory), than the amount paid for Ireland bilaterally (non-obligatory). Now add the €22.5bn IMF loan to Ireland. Even after taking into account the €26bn IMF loan to Portugal, the total amount you paid for Greece and Portugal, two countries with a combined population 5 TIMES larger than Ireland's, is LOWER.

And now we come to our conclusion. Why is the UK an IMF member?

Because THE UK NEEDED IMF and might need it again.

http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/sterling-devalued-imf-loan.htm

&gt; As pressure on the pound continued, the government approached the IMF for a loan of $3.9 billion in September 1976. This was **the largest amount ever requested of the Fund, which needed to seek additional funds from the US and Germany.**

I'd be very, very surprised if the EU did more than throw the UK a symbolic bone. The UK is seen as having more than its fair share of exceptions already, most from a time when the EEC was still small, but with such a large union as we have it today being more equal than others is not an option. Add to this the sense of blackmail, and that 26 governments would have to agree on something none of them really wants. It won't happen.

This puts Cameron into an awkward position. He essentially has made a promise he can't keep. I agree that he didn't have much of a choice, and for the next election the promise to have a referendum might work for the Tories, but the EU will play the ball right back into Cameron's court. He'll find himself in a position where he'll have nothing real to show for in terms of the more favorable conditions people now expect him to negotiate, and that's how the UK will go into that referendum.

On the plus side, this might put some pressure onto the EU to get its act together and outline a proper vision for the future. I'm not too optimistic about that, though, because as Thecaptchaisggreru has pointed out, finding a compromise is difficult.  
The debate the UK will be going through will hopefully have the positive effect of teaching people about how the EU works and which benefits it brings.

Privatising the water supply is like privatising the street in front of your driveway. There's no way around the monopole, because network competition doesn't make a single bit of sense, due to market constraints caused by material, physical, fact.

Increasing maximum working limits and lowering minimum wage together leads to effective slavery because subjectively the worker's quality of life is reduced to work, eat, sleep. There is evidence of this throughout contemporary Africa and China.

Yes. The loan to Ireland was *optional*. Your contribution to the IMF was *not*. You are member of this organization.

Νο, you did not paid *additionally* towards the Eurozone and it's not a semantics issue.

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"Well, ordoliberalism would be called, by contemporary neo-liberals (ordoliberalism was also ""neo-liberalism"", back in the days), socialism. But that's combat rhetoric.

The key thing is that ordoliberalism sees the free market as a theoretical model of goods exchange between perfectly rational actors having a perfectly transparent flow of information. Such a kind of market is, in theory, an optimal provider of human welfare. In theory, that is. In reality,  the model is unattainable, and to approximate it real-world markets need regulations so that private, intransparent, self-interest doesn't eat the approximation, leading to monopolies and all other kinds of fuckups.

That is, to ordoliberals ""free market"" is a thing approximated through regulation, and what contemporary neo-liberals call ""free market"" is, to us, an *unregulated market* guaranteed to become anything but free in no time.

Introducing yet another metaphor, Ordoliberals want a market police, so that different parties can compete in a market of free exchange, without anyone of them fielding their SA troops and disenfranchising all the others. Democracy, just in economical terms.

[Max Weber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber) and Karl Marx aren't actually that far apart in their analysis of the problems of markets and societies, they just approached the solution from diametrically opposite directions.

&gt;Portugal returns to long-term debt market
&gt;
&gt;Portugal has returned to the long-term debt market for the first time since being bailed out in 2011 in a landmark deal for the rehabilitation of the eurozone’s struggling peripheral economies.
&gt;
&gt;Bankers said demand for Portugal’s “syndicated tap”, increasing the size of an existing €6bn bond maturing in 2017, was in excess of €12bn.
&gt;
&gt;The stronger than expected demand came mainly from overseas investors, according to people familiar with the deal, and led the government to increase the offer size by a quarter to €2.5bn and lower the cost of borrowing to less than 5 per cent.
&gt;
&gt;Álvaro Santos Pereira, economy minister, said the bond sale was an “important step” towards re-establishing Portugal’s international credibility and a full return to debt markets.
&gt;
&gt;“By focusing on fiscal consolidation, important economic reforms and a social pact, we have shown that Portugal is at a clear distance from other [eurozone] countries facing difficulties,” he said.
&gt;
&gt;Jorge Moreira da Silva, vice-president of the centre-right Social Democrats, the senior government coalition partner, said the deal marked a “turning point” in Portugal’s attempts to wean itself off eurozone support and return to the government bond market.
&gt;
&gt;Lisbon’s bond deal follows a successful Spanish bond sale on Tuesday and comes as EU officials moved to ease the return of Portugal and Ireland to the long-term government debt market.
&gt;
&gt;Portugal’s 10-year bond yield on Wednesday fell to the lowest level since September 2010.
&gt;
&gt;“It is a sign of how markets are re-opening up that not just Spain and Italy have been able to get bonds away,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments.
&gt;
&gt;Olli Rehn, the EU’s monetary affairs commissioner, said on Tuesday that Portugal and Ireland could draw on a European Central Bank bond-buying programme to help them regain market access. Under its €78bn bailout agreement, Lisbon is scheduled to resume issuing long-term government debt by September, ahead of a €5.8bn bond repayment that falls due in the same month.
&gt;
&gt;Mr Moreira da Silva said the government’s confidence that it would comply with its budget deficit target for 2012 was among several factors that had made this “the right moment” to take a step towards regaining full market access.
&gt;
&gt;However, Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, Wednesday published less welcome news for the Portuguese government.
&gt;
&gt;It reported that the country’s public debt had risen to 120.3 per cent of national output in September, up 2.9 per cent from three months earlier and the third-highest debt-to-output ratio in the EU.
&gt;
&gt;“Most European countries are turning, but they are turning slowly,” Mr Milligan cautioned. “I don’t think we should get ahead of ourselves on the difficulties facing the eurozone.”

Private investors care less or not at all about the water, but about monetary return on investment. That return has to come from somewhere, that is, out of the populace' pockets, and can't be used for investing... not for investment the water works have to do, at least, but those of the private investors.

When you don't have a monopoly, private investors have to restrain themselves with their siphoning of the residue because they have competition, which can undercut them. When there's no competition, that incentive is gone: They can extract as much residue as they bloody well please.

Point 2. One of the downsides of being the first nation to create infrastructure for your people is that once you have it up and running it is harder to revise in the future, also learning from other people is impossible. Couple of examples, very narrow roads ( meaning introducing cycle lanes later is nearly impossible) and very low bridges ( meaning Double Decker rail travel is impossible) unless of-course you want to spend hundreds of billions of pounds doing a proper job.

That hasn't really happened in the UK - at least except for natural causes (drought).

Basically you can't use it to wash your car or water the plants or fill the swimming pool, or other somewhat secondary uses of a scarce commodity.

One genuine problem is that some water companies have underinvested in their infrastructure and suffer from massive leaks across the network among other issues, so the water we do have is being lost. But this was a problem in the nationalised days too and not every water company is like that.

Overall privatisation might be pointless but it is not as scary as some people like to put it. In the UK the water still comes out of the tap and it's still pretty cheap for what it is. We're not worrying about turning the taps on like we are for energy use.

We're talking about doctors here, they take years to train not everybody is up for the job.

&gt;By increasing working hours the quality of care will decrease.

Sure, we can't overextend them, and the hospitals and the governments know this.

The issue is why should the EU decide over these matters when it's just not their competence? If people get worse due to lack of care, who will be accountable? The doctors? But they would just be following EU law!

&gt;Mind you, I am not saying the quality will decrease for every single doctor,some people are vastly better at dealing with sleep deprivation than others... And some are vastly worse at it.

I have one in the family, he does these huge shifts were he works for example from 16h on a Monday till 8h on Wednesday and yes, he sleeps before going and sleeps when he arrives, but has to be there at all times because there must be someone on the premises 24/7 capable of dealing with everything, they're trained just for that, he does have shifts which are more light and were he gets to sleep for hours but there are others where there's just no room for a break as there are people who need to be taken care of immediately.

My point is that this ought to be regulated by those who're in charge of the thing, in this case, the people who work at the hospital in according to the national law.

Not the EU, if someone suffers from lack of care nobody in Brussels will take the blame, it will always be the doctor or the hospital the ones who take the fall. Let the practitioners and the institutions run things, they've been doing it for years and so far there have been no problems, adding useless EU regulation on top of this is incredibly short-sighted, it's basically asking for trouble as there's nothing to be fix and a lot that can go wrong.

&gt;And I don't see why the EU should not have laws for it, if your country already has those laws- great. Nothing needs to be done. That is, assuming those laws are adequate (and assuming the EU regulations are reasonable).

[Principle of subsidiarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity#General_principle_of_European_Union_law) - a matter ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized authority capable of addressing that matter effectively - not the role of the EU to regulate.

&gt;Beyond that, I feel that it's definitely EU's business to ensure the quality of medical care. With that said, I can definitely imagine people having differing opinions on what the EU should and should not regulate- and I don't think either opinion is more ""correct"" than the other.

Again, principle of subsidiarity. It's not that it's more correct this or that fashion, it's simply that we shouldn't be complicated what should be simple. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.",0,1358979302,null,0,false,0,c82cuw6,t3_1745qa,t1_c82cuw6,t1_c82azm0,null,1435639372,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Dans le même temps, ces réformes a minima visent à acheter la paix des marchés financiers et des agences de notation dans l'attente d'une hypothétique reprise, en leur offrant des symboles politiques à défaut d'une véritable conversion du modèle français. Cette schizophrénie qui met en scène la réforme pour mieux acter le statu quo, qui en appelle à la convergence européenne pour masquer une stratégie non coopérative hexagonale aux économies compétitives de l'Europe du Nord comme aux réformes structurelles de l'Europe du Sud, peut tromper un temps les marchés comme nos partenaires.

Pro: The only significant pro is that it leaves Britain to govern itself in nearly all aspects. Whether or not one sees this as a pro generally correlates to nationalism and patriotism. To nationalists, it is an important issue. To non-nationalists, it is not.

Cons: Nearly all aspects of Britain's political power, reputation and economy would suffer.

**Pros and Cons for the EU**

Pro: An EU without Britain removes the most significant obstacle to further integration.

Cons: The EU loses relevance and power in foreign, security, defense, and economic matters, but only slightly. It also creates the potential for a race to the bottom between the EU and Britain, as Britain could undermine EU integration efforts in order to siphon capital and investment.


I truly understand why many Brits are up in arms about the EU and how they think it doesn't work for them. The problem is that the only coherent argument that comes from the anti-EU camp is nationalist rhetoric over the concept of sovereignty. I am not a nationalist in any sense of the word. To me, that argument carries absolutely no weight. Britain should be governed by the British means nothing to me, because I think that Europe governed by Europeans is a much more potent force in domestic and international affairs. I don't see nationalism as a product of rationality. It is an artificial construct that serves only to impede human interaction at all levels. It is unnecessary and cumbersome in the modern age. I don't know for sure if Britain will end up leaving the EU, but I do know that if it does leave, the British public will come to see it as a massive mistake.

Look, the winner determines who is right and who is wrong.

In the end, the monument was not removed because it was a provocation. It was removed because it was built there illegally, without any permissions. There is a procedure that needs to be followed to obtain a permission to build something - including monuments.

Anyway, I think the change this year with the household fee is a step in the right direction. 

To get back to your question.. Yes, I could do without wetten dass (even though I really enjoyed that when I was a child), Volksmusik stuff, soaps, oftentimes talk shows, Leute heute, etc. But you know, taste changes over time. There is stuff like kulturzeit, which does not appeal to me, but where i think its great that it exists. (and there is tracks on arte, which maybe is kulturzeit for our Generation - and that is a show i thoroughly enjoy). 

How about zapp, weltspiegel, weltbilder, tagesschau, heute, 3sat nano, zdf. Reportage, report mainz/münchen, local news from your regional public tv station, I could go on. Then you have a good selection of public radio stations, some of which should appeal to most people in our society, useful while driving in your car. 

And then sometimes there are some pretty cool and sometimes experimental shows and documentaries on zdf neo. 

Overall I think really most people can get something out of the public offerings. And as I said, I believe it's good to have independent news. the infrastructure needs to be there anyway, so why not use it to broadcast some ""entertainment"" as well. And even though taste is very different for everybody, i think they are doing a pretty good job to cater to the taste of most people (hell, they are even broadcasting computer game shows now, so its not only Volksmusik and such). 

Only thing that is MAJORLY fucked up right now is the depublication. I think that the content we as citizens paid for, should be available freely on the Internet. 

And when broadcasting movies, I'd like them to deliver the English audio track as well. 

Other than that, I think they are doing mostly alright.

&gt;No. It's not. It's invaluable and good to have high quality news shows and magazines. 'Not relying on advertising money' is worthless in and of itself. The Rundfunkräte are filled with politicians and programs like Frontal21 show that you can do deliberate one-sided lying propaganda pieces just as well without any advertising. 

Not all is going well at the moment. Just saying, it would be worse, when only relying on advertising money, if you have to fear that they won't book any slots on your station, if you publish that one critical piece. As it was recently demonstrated, when politicians try to influence the stations directly, it triggers quite a bit of uproar.

Private operators need to earn their revenues somehow. 

Claiming, that privatisations will rise standards is pure nonsense. There are no cases, in which privatisations have made things better, its quite the opposite. British Rail was one of the most effective railways in the world and operated a dense net. After its privatisation, many lines were vlosed, the railway system needed more subventions than before. Another case of a failed privatisation is the case of the rstonian railways. Within 5 years, the new owners rendered the infrastruture inoperable, the state had to pay it back for twice the price it earned by selling it. Another case is that of the austrian postal service, that was partially privatised and is unable to deliver ore than 50% of my mail.

I am tired of the neoconservative ""Private owners will make everything better"" fairytale. There is no evidence to support this claim.

That's a complex problem and government has plenty of blame to shoulder for it too.

&gt; Could you imagine if water was as badly mismanaged? 

After 25 years of privatisation things haven't turned out that way. You appear to be posing a lot of ""what if?"" but there's very real proof south of the border that things haven't gone to hell in a handbasket.

&gt; For the record, by the way, Scotland's water is not privatised, but still privately owned. 

Great.

&gt; The average Scottish water bill is also lower than the average water bill in England and Wales (but, of course, there are other contributing factors there).

I live in the part of England with the highest water bills. Apparently a lot of the cause is due to a dire need for investment post-privatisation, as well as the fact that so much of England's bathing waters lie within the region and we're subsidising it for the tourists to come down and use it. (hence the government is giving money to the water company who in turn is passing it on to us by way of bill discounts).

It's very easy to say ""bills are higher after privatisation"" but how do you know it is because of privatisation?

&gt;  I would not appreciate any movement to privatise our water, and nor would the Scottish Government: our Finance Secretary, John Swinney, reiterated the SNP's commitment to keeping Scottish Water privatised just a few days ago.

It will be very interesting to see what happens to all of those grand schemes if/when Scotland gains independence.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"Difficult question, though the question assumes too much in itself. Perhaps Europe will never become majority Muslim. Here are things to consider for countries like France and the UK :

* When the baby boom generation dies, in say, two to four decades, there will suddenly be a massive shift in demographics, considering most babyboomers, who account for most of the population, are native white European Christians or atheists. In their generation, there are very few non-Europeans. Most immigrants, or people of immigrant origin, belong to the younger generations, so say if the UK is 85% white, it's like 95% white Christian for those over 60, and much, much lower for those under 30.

* If the UK and France become majority Muslim, the world would have strong Muslim-majority countries with sophisticated nuclear weaponry. However, even if the UK or France have 51% of the population claiming to be Muslim, there would still be a very sizable ""minority"" of non-Muslims whom politicians will have to account for, no matter how the ""transition"" occurs. It may be peaceful and the Muslim majority may be ""westernized"" and moderate, and they may adopt Western values of freedom and tolerance, or it may cause extreme social and political strife. Other factors may come into play. It's anyone's guess. The UK and France have strong things going for themselves. The UK has a very ingrained Royal family, France has a very strong culture of secularism and human rights. These things can't be ignored and would logically have influence in the future turn of events.

I personally think there will be many social troubles, more talks about anti-blasphemy laws (because of the growing Muslim population), and politicians will gradually need to cave in more and more to satisfy the Muslim minority, until they become a majority. Many things can change until then, like Muslims being more vocal in preferring a free society and embracing Western ideals rather than extremist views, or people of immigrant origins moving back to their country of origins as their economy develops and Europe's stagnates. Or Europe deciding itself that considering their stagnation they don't want uneducated immigrants anymore. Many things can happen.

&gt;  but it isn't discrimination, either; all of the money spent by the Scottish Government, including on the complete subsidisation of tuition fees, comes from Scotland. Want free university? You can fucking pay for it. 

Of course it's discrimination. Come from an EU country? Free tuition. Come from the union? You can pay £9k/year. Maybe it wouldn't be as big a deal if it wasn't for a lot of Scottish MPs voting for increased tuition when it doesn't affect them.

In other words, it seems that likelihood to kill depends directly on the means available as much as some natural aggression or antipathy towards other people which will emerge regardless, and that regulation can under certain circumstances effectively remove those means, and thus the crime.

It's completely irrelevant that Gordon Brown was Scottish; I'm not saying ""Scottish people can do no wrong"", but that the voting tendencies of people in Scotland is more left-leaning than the people of the UK as a whole, as evidenced by the balance of power in Holyrood compared to Westminster. Scotland didn't single-handedly elect Tony Blair. Besides, the electoral system for Westminster is unfairly bipartisan as a result of the first-past-the-post system. Holyrood uses the Additional Member System which strikes me as much fairer. In Westminster elections, the choice is ""Labour or Tories""; in Holyrood elections, there are many more viable options.

It's also ridiculous to call it discrimination on the basis of the EU front. We're legally obliged to provide free tuition to citizens from other EU countries; it wasn't a choice on our behalf, intended to snub the other home nations. We're using taxpayers' money to give free tuition to all the people who pay tax here. It doesn't matter if you're Scottish, English, Welsh, or Northern Irish: it is not an *ethnic* requirement, it is a *residency* requirement. Imagine if Birmingham's city council announced it would give residents free parking all year round, and then somebody from Manchester inexplicably complained that they should have the right to free parking in Birmingham too.

&gt;Maybe it wouldn't be as big a deal if it wasn't for a lot of Scottish MPs voting for increased tuition when it doesn't affect them. [...] What else would you suggest? That Labour (*spit*) get in because they're more popular in Scotland? England gets the most say because it has 50 million people.

I agree that the West Lothian question is pertinent. I'm all in favour of English devolution. Fortunately for you, Scottish independence solves the West Lothian question, another example of how independence is mutually beneficial. I should also point out that while MPs from Labour, the Conservatives, etc. elected in Scotland are encouraged by their party to vote on issues outwith Scotland, the SNP, leading the argument for Scottish independence, have policy to never vote on issues that don't affect Scotland.

I also agree, it makes sense that England has the largest say in Westminster as a result of its huge population. I'm not expecting Westminster to suddenly introduce degressive proportionality, especially when it can't even reform the electoral system or the House of Lords. I think this is still an excellent reason for independence, though. How can the people of Scotland prosper when they do not have a loud voice in domestic policy? There are many key issues on which Scottish Parliament cannot legislate, and parties such as the SNP have made clear they would legislate on these issues in a different way than Westminster has. Independence is the one chance the people of Scotland have to say ""okay, then: let's see if politicians in Scotland can serve Scotland better than politicians outwith Scotland"".

&gt;That 2.5% is contributing at least 8.7% of the births in the UK, you do the math.(sic)

The Pew Research Center published a study in 2011, forecasting an increase of Muslims in the European population from 6% in 2010 to just 8% in 2030. They also found that Muslim fertility rate in Europe would drop from 2.2 in 2010 to 2.0 in 2030 whilst the non-Muslim fertility rate in Europe would increase from 1.5 in 2010 to 1.6 in 2030.

Separately, Philip Jenkins of Penn State University estimates that Muslims won't comprise 25% of Europe's population untill 2100, and that doesn't take into account the drop over that time in religiosity.

These are figures for the geographical area of Europe, not for the EU, so they include parts of Turkey and Russia.

And where, exactly, did you come to this conclusion? The vast majority of Muslims do not go out in gangs and try to enforce their own version of Sharia on people, nor do they blow things up or take hostages. They are rightfully embarrassed of that behavior and worried about how it will affect public perception of them in a society which is only too eager to paint them all with the same brush. The guy in the video gave a theological explanation, with citations, about why this behavior is wrong. If fundamentalist Christians went around trying to enforce their views on everybody, nobody would assert that the fault lies in Christianity, but in the people who feel they have a right to control others. The difference is, when Christians in western countries try and impose their beliefs on people, it is usually through the legal process, and they have the force of the government behind them to interfere in people's freedoms. The problem is still the attitudes of fundamentalists, not the religion itself. Jeez, people beat each other up for wearing the wrong football jersey, nobody blames football for that either, or assumes that the non-hooligans are a ""minority.""

*Fino al 1883, il 75-90% della carta di tutto il mondo era prodotta dalla fibra della pianta di cannabis* [1]

I vantaggi della canapa da fibra, rispetto a cotone e legno, principalmente sono:

* La canapa è cresce molto velocemente, un albero impiega anni per raggiungere un metro di altezza

* Quando viene tagliata la canapa si tiene solo l'arbusto, il 50% della pianta rimane nel suolo sotto forma di radici che consolidano il terreno (la canapa ha delle radici veramente toste) e lo nutrono.

* La canapa ha fibre molto lunghe e resistenti

* La canapa ha bisogno di poca/nulla cura, è una pianta infestante, il cotone invece ha bisogno di molti pesticidi perchè è molto delicata

* La qualità della carta derivata dalla canapa è nettamente superiore e necessita di pochi solventi per lo sbiancamento (la fibra di canapa è molto chiara)

Je n'approuve pas la politique du gouvernement actuel, mais j'approuve encore moins la critique qu'en fait le Point, et cet édito en particulier.

Par exemple, il n'y a pas de mise en place d'une fiscalité confiscatoire sur la capital, il y a une mise en place d'une fiscalité sur les *revenus* du capital (dividendes). Ces revenus ont explosé depuis 30 ans. Pour créer de l'emploi, il faut que l'argent des bénéfices soit réinvesti. L'imposition sur les revenus du capital est notamment une façon d'encourager au réinvestissement d'une partie des bénéfices plutôt qu'au versement de dividendes.

Réduire les dépenses de l'état, réduire les impôts et les cotisations sociales, c'est faire des économies sur la santé, sur l'éducation, sur les infrastructures... bref, sur le long-terme. Tout ça alors qu'une énorme partie des dépenses engagées par l'état l'est pour le remboursement des intérêts de la dette, et malheureusement pas pour cet investissement sur le futur, qui pourrait par ailleurs faire fonctionner l'économie.

Enfin, ça n'a pas de sens de vouloir faire de la croissance à tout prix. Produire n'importe quoi, dans n'importe quelles conditions écologiques et sociales est idiot et nous mène à la catastrophe.

Don't you think that's a little extreme?

Not too long ago I (an American) started chatting (text with Skype) with a German girl to help her improve her English in exchange for her helping me with German. In the very beginning, she went right into talking about problems with her boyfriend cheating on her. Something like that is considered quite inappropriate here and it made me feel really uncomfortable having her tell me all of this stuff when I didn't even know small things like what her hobbies are. The thing is, I've been made well aware of the fact that Germans don't particularly like small talk and they tend to not be shy about talking about such personal things to people they don't know well.

Her behavior was very different from what's considered acceptable in my culture, but it's acceptable in hers. I don't agree with it, but I'm not going to say there is something wrong with her.

That's the only incentive of any business, actually, and that's the problem. The most financially efficient way to run a monopoly is to increase prices and decrease all costs (service, maintenance, etc) as much as possible. This is how free markets work, not monopolies. From what I've heard, prices have skyrocketed for cities that sold their water pipes.

And why do you suggest that publicly supplied water is free? That's complete poppycock! The question is *how* we pay for it, if we get a yearly bill or if everything is payed for by income taxes or what have you. But we *have* to pay for our water, obviously. The difference is that, if we employ private businesses to deliver our water, we have to finance their profit margins on top of the actual service. The government isn't interested in profits.

You seem to think that the government is just another private business with special powers. But it's not, the government is just an organisational abstraction layer of the people. Everything it does, it does for everyone's well-being. (At least that's how it should be; if it isn't that's a much bigger problem than privatisation.)

You cannot paint the entire Muslim population with one brush. The majority, just like any other religion, just want to be left alone to practice. Saudi Arabia has to deal with protests all the time, Egypt is incapable of protecting its people from the fundamentalist gangs that prey on their own people, and Iran is a dictatorship. None of that implies that the Muslim majority wants to impose their will on non-Muslims.
