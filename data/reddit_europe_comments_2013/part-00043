true,archibald_tuttle,flag-de,(?|?),"I noticed some things in general: 

- you should *really* have articles with the words, e.g. ""**der** Stuhl"", ""**das** Sofa"". Learners of German have a hard time getting these correctly, so it helps to memorize them with the vocabulary.
- the kind of phonetic translation is simple, but this leads to some situations where I'm not satisfied. Especially the umlauts (ä, ö, ü) are transcribed in such a way that I doubt that the reader will get how they sound. I don't know how to handle this, maybe just write e.g. ""glü-lahmpe"" and explain umlauts on the first few pages.
- similar situation with [ich-Laut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_phonology#Ich-Laut_and_ach-Laut) and sch-sound (as in the beginning of the word ""sheep""). Sometimes ""sch"" is translated into ""sj"" sounds, which makes no sense IMO (example: ""Schlauch [sjlauch]"" should be [shlauch]).

here some details I also noticed:

- spelling error: ""magazine"" translates to ""das Magazin"" (""Magazine"" is the plural form)
- the phonetic spelling of ""die Zeitschrift"" as ""tsight-sgrift"" seems odd. Maybe there is a better way to express the ""sch""-sound. I noticed how in other places the ""sch""-sound was just written as ""sch"" (example: ""der Tisch"").
- the phonetic spelling of ""der PC"" would be ""peh-tseh""
- the phonetic spelling of ""laptop"" is given as ""lap-top"". This is a bit ambiguous, since a native German speaker would write ""läp-top"" for the pronunciation. 
- the phonetic translation of ""das Aquarium"" should be ""a-kwa-rioom"" IMO.
- another popular translation for light bulb is ""die Glühbirne"", especially among laypersons (i.e. not electricians or engineers)
- the phonetic translation of ""der Teppich"" is *not* ""tepp-i**sch**"" but rather an [ich-Laut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_phonology#Ich-Laut_and_ach-Laut). IDK how to write this in this simplified phonetic language.
- typo: ""die **U**hr"" has to be upper case (since it's a noun)
- the word ""der Lichtschalter"" again has an ich-Laut (not an ""sch""-Laut).
- the word ""sheet"" is called ""das Betttuch"" or ""das Bettlaken"" in German (if we talk about sheet as the thing on beds. A sheet of paper would be ""das Blatt Papier"").
- light/das Licht. Again an ich-Laut
- kitchen sink translates more typical to ""das Spülbecken"". A ""Waschbecken"" is usually a sink found in bathrooms. The translation is not exactly *wrong*, but a little bit odd.
- ""Der Schrank"" has to be upper case.
- pan vs. frying pan. In German, I would refer to the things labeled ""pans"" as ""der Topf""/""die Töpfe"" and to the frying pan as ""die Pfanne"". Especially those pans in the image have a very high wall, so this would not called ""Pfanne"" any more.
- typo: its calle ""der Bese**n**"".
- nobody calls toilet paper ""WC-Papier"". We all say ""das Toilettenpapier"" or ""das Klopapier"" (""Klo"" is another word for toilet).
- sink/Waschbecken. You got it right! This is what I meant by ""Waschbecken is found in bathrooms, Spülbecken is kitchen sink"".
- scissors are calle ""Schere"". The spelling error ""Schäre"" made me chuckle a little bit :3
- the phonetic translation for ""der ""Bücherschrank"" &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; Okay, this was a mean one since it has all things in it that are hard: ü-Umlaut, then ich-Laut, then sch-sound. I would write [bü-cher-schrank] (and hope that the reader gets ü, ch, sch correctly).
- ""die Puppe"" needs an uppercase P.
- ""das Schloss"" would be pronounced [shloss]
- the translation ""breakfast cereal""/""Cornflakes"" does not make much sense. We don't call all cereal ""Cornflakes"", but only - surprise - corn flakes. As far as I know there is not a popular word for generic breakfast cereal. There is a word called ""Frühstücksflocken"", but nobody ever uses it. In short: corn flakes are called ""Cornflakes"", granola is called ""Müsli"", the rest us usually called by its brand name.
- ""die Milch"" has an ""ich-Laut"" at its end. No ""sch""/""sh"" sound here!
- Der Apfel needs an uppercase A.
- fun fact: Engineers usually get anal about how to correctly name screwdrivers. The word ""Schraubenzieher"" is the more popular, but technically speaking wrong term (which would be ""der Schraubendreher"").
- grass translates to ""das Gras""
- ""der Baum"" needs an upper case B
- ""die Harke"" needs an upper case H. I would also give the alternate translation ""der Rechen"" which is pretty much the same thing (I had to look up the difference: its mainly the length of the handle and the application of the tool).

You are right, though, tips around five percent are common and hardly anyone goes far beyond that. Also, working with percentages is not common. People will just round up to something that feels right to them. I know that, for example, my parents and myself (and I would guess also other people) think of tips in Euros, not so much percentages. So, rounding up to the next Euro and adding three or four Euro is the common procedure.

I also know many people who give (even by five percent standards) horrid tips. I think it’s a pretty common thing, but I’m not sure. So, rounding up to the next Euro, for example, is very common (for regular middle class people). It’s definitely socially acceptable – much more so than in the US – to tip very low.

Also, waiters are not necessarily getting paid fairly. There is no minimum wage in Germany, certainly not for waiters. They can expect to be paid about 7 Euro or so per hour, sometimes substantially less. That’s not a lot.

- you are being tracked, listened to, data mined like the secret police never could... 

- you have the freedom to be ignored by the other mindless consumers, because they don't care about what you have to say... internet and the 24 hour news cycle drowns down everything in a amorphous cacophony (I don't know what I'm trying to express there, but I liked the way it sounds)

And yes, you won't be jailed... communists never understood this, but if you jail somebody, he/she/it becomes important. Except Mike Tyson...

* Forfait smartphone, en low-cost (Free ou Sosh, par exemple), c'est environ 20 €.
* Internet, 30 €.
* Transport, un Navigo zone 1 et 2, c'est 60 €.

Soit déjà 110 € uniquement pour ça.

Il reste donc 90 € pour les repas (et les extras). C'est très juste, mais pas insurmontable en se limitant au strict nécessaire. Des pâtes, du riz, quelques légumes, peu de viande, pas de sodas… Ça se tient. Mais ça ne fait quand même que 3 € par jour.

Du coup, pour économiser, c'est assez facile de se passer de connexion Internet à Paris. Si avec un peu de chance tu captes un réseau FreeWifi, SFR ou Bouygues d'un voisin, tu devrais rapidement pouvoir en profiter en trouvant des codes d'accès sur Internet, si jamais tu n'en as pas déjà. Ce n'est pas le plus agréable, mais c'est toujours 30 € d'économisés. Et là, ça permet de passer à 4 € par jour de nourriture.

As always, you can tip as much as you want, but when you get your hair cut, I would always tip something, at least one Euro, probably more for more involved stuff (though if you are male you are probably not as much affected by that).

My hairdresser also used to charge around 18 Euro for a standard male haircut (including washing, drying). Now that I’m rapidly losing my hair she can (or has to) use her machine all the way and I’m paying less than a third of the original price. (Hey, there are advantages after all!) I still tip one Euro, though.

In general, no one will complain if you tip. If you are from the US, you can just tip as you would have back home and everyone you tip will be generally delighted and sometimes surprised, certainly not complaining.

It is, however, uncommon to tip anyone besides waiters in restaurants, hairdressers (or people in similar service jobs in the service industry, e.g. doing manicure or something like that), delivery people and (maybe) taxi drivers.

People in general do not tip doctors and their staff, anyone in take-away or self-service restaurants (though I have seen people rounding up to the next Euro and commonly do that myself).

What is somewhat (but no super) common is giving your postman/woman (or other delivery people) a little present for Christmas, maybe a bottle of wine and ten Euro or something like that, the same is true for garbage collectors.

Update: See Ana Pauker, her life and her contribution to imposing a communist regime in Romania.  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Pauker

A couple of quotes relevant to this discussion:

&gt;In Moscow, she became the leader of the Romanian Communist exiles who would later become known as the Muscovite faction. She returned to Romania in 1944 when the Red Army entered the country, becoming a member of the postwar government, which came to be dominated by the Communists.

and

&gt;Gheorghiu-Dej profited from the mounting anti-Semitism in Soviet policy and actively lobbied Joseph Stalin to take action against the Pauker faction. Dej traveled to Moscow in August 1951 to seek Stalin's approval for purging Pauker and her allies in the Secretariat (Vasile Luca and Teohari Georgescu).

&gt;but who and how can decide just how many art history students are enough without a market for it?

Why would you have to decide that? Let the people choose what they want to study.

&gt;Treating the university as a something serving personal interest or hobby (which could be done in a public library or online) instead of a preparation for a realistic career is in a way parasitic on society

Nonsense. People whose specialization is their hobby tend to be much better in it than those who pursue it just because the jobs pay well.

&gt;People should be responsible for their hobbies and interests themselves, education should be geared towards what people will actually do.  

Why would you want to dictate what should people study?

&gt;Healthcare is more complex. The best way to exploit is to get disability for every minor thing. We in Hungary managed to put 8% of the population on disability at one point. 800K disabled out of 10M. It was basically seen as a way to retire. Opps, cannot find a job and 10 years to pension? This good friend doctor will just put you on disability. For a price of course.

The actual implementation by Lenine never went past the phase of revolution. When Staline picked it up he thwarted it into another dictatorship.


Communism != fascism and communism != dictatorship. Communism doesn't promote terror, indocrination, discrimination, theft, oppression or any of those pejoratives you mentioned.


If you think it does, please tell me where in Marx's essays you find evidence of such actions. I'd be happy to know.

Par contre je penses qu'il y a peut être une petite faute dans le raisonnement de Mr. Jancovici.

La croissance due aux spéculations financière, comme celle des années 2000 aux US avant le crash de 2007, ou en Asie Orientale dans les années 80, précédant le crash de 1990, sont possible sans augmentation énergétique, car elles ne se basent pas sur l'économie réelle, sur la production.

Pour résumer, il a raison de dire que la croissance réelle, celle d'une expansion de l'économie sur le terrain, ne peut pas arriver sans augmentation de la production énergétique, mais cela n'exclue pas une croissance nocive et virtuelle (dans le cas d'une production énergétique stagnante), prédestinée à crasher après l'explosion de la bulle, pas tip top....

Un tale sistema inoltre dovrebbe essere tassativamente sotto il controllo dello stato che dovrebbe controllarne tutti gli aspetti e tutte le fasi.

Per realizzarlo sono necessarie considerevoli infrastrutture e, soprattutto, una adeguata *educazione* dei cittadini. Già oggi per alcune procedure e atti sono previsti sistemi informatici (ad es. la presentazione di certi documenti fiscali) mediante l'uso di smart card + pin. Ebbene, nel 90% dei casi i titolari delle aziende non hanno voglia di imparare ad usarli, per cui mollano sia la smart card che il pin al commercialista così fa tutto lui. Quello che doveva essere un modo per semplificare l'autenticazione e la verifica dell'identità di fatto le ha annullate entrambe, e ci son già stati casi di commercialisti che hanno fatto casini e falsi per intascarsi i soldi.

Basta questo esempio per pensare a cosa succederebbe col voto, specie nei casi di voto di scambio: gente che si fa dare smartcard a mazzi e poi vota per tutti. Il fatto di doversi recare in un posto preciso, con un buon numero di testimoni e una cabina chiusa è una fondamentale garanzia della libertà del voto.

Yes, companies quite often look for junior programmers who 'know' multiple languages. It looks scary, but it really isn't, 99% of the time companies understand that they can't get a junior programmer who knows all that stuff good. So you should try to apply even if you don't have working experience in all of the specified languages, just some basic ideas and syntax behind the language.

And the idea behind programming is the same, just some syntax differences, once you get the hang of it you can learn pretty much anything if you are willing to put effort into it :)",0,1362511911,null,0,false,0,c8qa5ru,t3_19plj4,t1_c8qa5ru,t1_c8q6lok,null,1431491907,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

&gt;It at least shows some Europeans are honest enough to admit their countries involvement in slavery

Back then slavery was widespread all over the world, we did nothing different than everyone else.

&gt;Unfortunately the rest still have the delusion that ""we helped them"" by enslaving millions and subjecting their countries for centuries

We bought our slaves from other black tribes, we took them to our nations where they now enjoy a far better life than their African counterparts who live in AIDS infested nations with people starving left and right. And there's also that part where we invested countless resources developing sub-Saharan Africa from mud huts to where it was at decolonization.

&gt;(the ramifications of which are still being felt).

No. Il Pdl è Berlusconi, e se Berlusconi vuole fare il presidente del Senato (e lo vuole per due motivi: riconoscimento istituzionale e salvacondotto giudiziario) non è che uno salta su e dice vedi caro Silvio, certo che la Meloni sarebbe più presentabile. L'ipotesi di un presidente del Senato del Pdl che non sia Berlusconi esiste solo se i magistrati lo fottono sul tempo e riescono a smerdarlo per bene prima della proclamazione degli eletti. Altrimenti si fa un presidente del Senato che non è del Pdl, ma a quel punto significa che l'accordo generale è già andato per fratte da prima
 
&gt; Uno scenario alternativo

Lo scenario che hai in testa è suggestivo, ma ha un problema strutturale. Quand'anche Napolitano si calasse un acido e telefonasse a Beppe Grillo per dargli l'incarico (venendo prontamente mandato in culo), a votare non si tornerebbe comunque. Primo perché ormai è chiaro che la legge elettorale va cambiata in quanto non più rispondente all'assetto politico del Paese e secondo perché rivotare subito equivarrebbe a dire al mondo che la Grecia siamo noi. Posto che un governo almeno di sei mesi che faccia legge elettorale, manovra e un paio di altre riforme per ammansire i mercati tocca metterlo in piedi, tanto vale saltare il passaggio di dare l'incarico a Grillo e mettersi da subito a lavorare sul governo tecnicissimo (che è quello che in questo momento ha in testa Napolitano)

The most difficult part is getting to Germany because learning the language here is easy. The full exposure really helps.

Here's how I did it. I took German for my last year of high school and learned pretty intensively on the side, then I traveled to Germany and took in all 4 months of language courses. I was able to move from A2 to B2.1 in that time. I took the [TestDaF](http://www.testdaf.de/index.php), didn't do well enough to apply for Uni, but well enough to get into a course offered by Studienkolleg at TU Berlin. After one semester of that (enrolled as a student which makes studnet housing and cheap metro tickets a possibility) I took another exam for free offered by TU Berlin [(DSH)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Sprachpr%C3%BCfung_f%C3%BCr_den_Hochschulzugang), applied to TU and got in.

If you give 1-2 years to learn the language (depends on your language skills but 2 years max for sure), you can do it. I did it and plenty of other students did it.

First semester is difficult because of the language barrier, but as you use it more and pass/fail your first few exams, you are pretty much straightened out and in line with the program by the next semester.

I'm pretty sure Australia has affirmative action and welfare for Aboriginals, they may live a bad life but it is without no doubt better than the one their ancestors led before Europeans arrived.

Menschen sind gleichgültiger, zynischer und desinteressierter geworden, weil die Politik dermaßen undurchsichtig und korrput geworden ist. Außerdem ist das leben der Politiker in der Regel weiter vom Leben ""normaler"" Menschen entfernt, als die Sonne und der Mond.

Mappus-Affäre: Ein einziger riesiger Betrug, der kaum offensichtlicher sein könnte. Bekommt Herr Mappus dafür eine Strafe? Nein. 
Der durchschnittliche Bürger denkt sich dann so etwas wie ""Jeder andere Bürger wäre längst im Knast"".
Bei den ganzen Dissertationsbetrügereien genauso. Da denkt man als Bürger doch auch ""Warum muss ich als ""Normalo"" richtig und ordentlich arbeiten, aber Politiker dürfen sich so einen Titel einfach erschwindeln?""

Macht es nicht besser, aber die sind daher natürlich eben nicht im Fokus der Berichterstattung) 

Politiker müssen (wieder?) als Vorbilder agieren, dann interessieren sich auch wieder mehr Menschen für Politik und werden die deutsche Politik mehr befürworten.

Dass Bundesverfassungsgericht hat meiner Meinung nach auch deshalb einen so guten Ruf, weil seine Entscheidungen für den Otto-Normal-Bürger (in der Regel) einfach nachzuvollziehen sind. 

Und wenn es das BVerfG nicht gäbe, kämen die deutschen Bürger vielleicht gar nicht mehr dazu, die Verantwortlichen abzuwählen.

I think, to explain today's instability from a historical point of view you have to keep in mind at least three basic factors:

1. The Italian constitution and the procedures therein indicated to form a government, which, as far as I know, are pretty different from most other countries and makes government instability quite frequent.

2. The Mani Pulite corruption scandal, which swept away all traditional parties in a few years.

3. The divisive figure of Berlusconi, which makes a grosse koalition type of scenario (almost) unthinkable in Italy, unlike Germany and the UK.

But fast entry to Schengen and the EU cause a brain drain from these more or less developing countries, and an economic pressure to Western Europe, which levels down the economic credibility of Europe as a whole.

Basically, we should take it slow and sure. Europe is just too impatient. 

I honestly think that if the EU (I know, it's not the same as Schengen, but it's a similar ideology) stayed with the first original founders, and a few later members, it would already be very close to a federation by now, and thus presumably, the economic superpower considering its own economy, and its economic zone of influence in the rest of Europe.

And what do you expect me to do? I don't deny that slavery was wrong but I'm not going to apologize for it nor pretend that the life of Africans wasn't improved by colonization.

&gt;Good, they're trying to amend historical wrongs.

What wrong? Might is right, Aboriginals weren't using their land as well as we can so we went there and colonized it and now Australia is a far more productive place than it ever was back then.

&gt;Indeed, keeping the population relatively ignorant was one of the chief policies of colonial countries. Thus the decline after decolonization is their fault. 

Yes, everything bad that happened in Africa after blacks demanded freedom is the fault of evil whitey. We are always keeping a brother down. It's not like they're, on average, less intelligent than us and that's why black societies are always shit compared to ours.

I never said we were just doing it to help them, of course we did it for ourselves but that does not change the fact that everyone's life was improved in the long run thanks to colonization.

In pratica: se hai la mailbox da prima del 2012 e non hai mai fatto un'espansione dello spazio allora hai 1GB per Picasa e Drive e la mailbox di dimensione variabile (dipende da quanto tempo sei utente). Se hai fatto un'espansione dello spazio prima del 2012 (come me) la mailbox ti rimane a 30GB e lo spazio per Drive e Picasa lo paghi 5 dollari l'anno. Chi fa adesso l'espansione si vede la mailbox portata a 10GB (sia che prima avesse di più, sia che avesse di meno) e paga 30 dollari l'anno per lo spazio aggiuntivo su Picasa e Drive.

There's no way Spanish will stop being spoken. It's has the same level of use as Catalan and is even more used than Catalan in Barcelona (or in other places with many immigrants).

Admiting it is a start, now you just need to stop justifying it.

&gt;What wrong? 

I was referring to the descrimination after colonisation.

&gt;Might is right, Aboriginals weren't using their land as well as we can so we went there and colonized it and now Australia is a far more productive place than it ever was back then.

Again you're justifying it after-the-fact. Every country is more productive then it was in the 17th century, the question is how would they have developed if they weren't colonised. 

&gt;Yes, everything bad that happened in Africa after blacks demanded freedom is the fault of evil whitey.

I didn't claim that nor do I believe it. What I did claim is that centuries of explotation and the current state of Africa is not unrelated.

Feel free to ask any French if the translation is correct or not

I don't know French and I wouldn't trust your translation. What I will say is that ""a candidate for the Togan presidency"" (which the imigur you linked claimed) is pushing it. He was rejected as a candidate because he didn't have valid documments. A better description would be 'a French politician.' The point is, why should we give his views any weight?

&gt;I never said we were just doing it to help them, of course we did it for ourselves

Good, you at least recognise this much. There is hope for you yet.

&gt; but that does not change the fact that everyone's life was improved in the long run thanks to colonization.

That's a pretty bold claim. ""Thanks to colonization""? 1) you don't know this 2) it doesn't then justify it. 

&gt;Slavery was wrong but back then standards were different.

Indeed, we should be wary of apllying modern standards to past socities. But those now living in those socities should admit that they were built on the back of an explotioted people (both racially and in terms of class).

&gt;We should not be ashamed of it and much less should we parade around apologizing like we were the only ones to enslave others.

I think being ashamed of it would help rid Europeans of their current sense of superiority. Slavery developed into colonisation and this then developed into the current form which is a belief in the cultural, social, intellectual, etc superiority of Europe; not only against those they traditionally exploited but also against Americans (in what I can only describe as the most pathetic inferiority complex I have ever witnesed).

L'ho trovato in OsmAnd.

Ho cominciato a metterlo alla prova su alcuni percorsi che faccio abitualmente, e benché i risultati non siano perfetti sono rimasto decisamente soddisfatto: ho anche notato che alcuni degli errori di routing e/o di annuncio della strada da fare erano legati ad imperfezioni delle mappe (es. rotatorie non marcate come tali). Risultato? Ho cominciato (da poche ore!) a fare le prime modifiche ‘serie’ ai dati OSM.

Hypo Real Estate cost the Germans over €100B alone. Britain's bailout has cost them over £100B. Our bailout has cost us a lot and as a proportion of GDP it is probably higher than other EU countries but it isn't any where near as bad as Taft makes it out to be and it certainly isn't 40% of the total cost of EU bailouts. As the old saying goes, there are lies, damned lies and statistics. Taft is just taking the figures from the Eurostat reports that make our bailout look significantly worse than other EU countries when it is not the case.

There is shame, however, in overstating your abilities, which reflect negatively upon your character namely in that you either had the intent to deceive or lacked the effort to properly state how good you can do something.

So why not play it safe and only state your abilities to a modest degree and let your abilities speak for themselves? What's even more mind-boggling are people who know the other person can easily judge their abilities but proceed to overstate their abilities anyway. Like language learners. You'll get people who are learning German who run into native or fluent speakers who claim they ""can speak"" or ""can speak German well"" but then immediately humiliate themselves with embarrassingly bad German, which is only embarrassing, by the way, because they think or appear to think their German is good. Did you not think that the native/fluent speaker can tell that your German is actually piss poor? Why not let your abilities speak for yourself instead of trying too look good for the few moments until people actually judge your abilities for themselves?

If someone asks me if I'm any good at something, the most I'll say is ""I'm okay at it"" and if I can't simply demonstrate my abilities, I might try to back it up with a description of my experience or something else quantifiable, never empty praise of my own abilities.",0,1362546559,null,0,false,0,c8qlxnv,t3_19n1w8,t1_c8qlxnv,t3_19n1w8,null,1431497505,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

It's like trying to tack on a new section to the boat, but the new section has holes in the side. Sure, you can keep bailing out the water but unless you patch the holes the whole ship will sink.

Part of the problem Europe faces is an economic union which necessarily ties together these nations and makes them dependent on each other, but also leaves them politically and bureaucratically independent enough to hang themselves - which would be fine if they weren't now integral facets of the overall European community, making their failure a threat to the success of all the other nations.",0,1362559203,null,0,false,0,c8qom3y,t3_19oi59,t1_c8qom3y,t1_c8qet1x,null,1431498724,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Du glaubst doch nicht an das Ammenmärchen, dass die Politik die Wirtschaft lenken kann, oder? Für mich ist das eine simple Lüge, die Politiker gerne verbreiten, damit sie weiterhin schwarze Koffer von der Industrie bekommen können, ohne dass das jemand hinterfragt.

&gt; Warum müssen Politiker mehr Vorbild sein als Du und ich?

Weil Sie unser Land steuern und Regeln setzen, die für alle verbindlich sind (oder sein sollten). Neben der Legitimität durch den Wähler benötigen sie meiner Meinung nach daher auch eine moralische Legitimität. Warum soll ich mich an Regeln halten, die jemand aufstellt, der sich selbst gar nicht an (andere) Regeln hält?
Für mich muss ein Poltiker gar nichts sein, außer integer.

Man muss es nämlich gerade *nicht* jedem Recht machen, sondern man muss zu seinen Überzeugungen stehen. 

Bei Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger stimme ich dir zu. Lammert finde ich ganz okay, De Maiziere ist für mich ein Idiot. 


&gt;Und was ist das überhaupt für ein Argument?: ""Die Politiker sind korrupt, deswegen will ich mich mit der Scheiße nicht auseinander setzen!"" Gerade dann sollte man es erst Recht tun!

Natürlich ist es doof von Leuten, dann nicht die ""Jetzt erst recht!""-Einstellung zu haben. Aber so etwas erzeugt eben ein Ohnmachtsgefühl. In der Politikwissenschaft spricht man da von fehlender politischen Wirksamkeit (oder *political efficacy*). Menschen haben nicht das Gefühl, dass ihre Stimme etwas zählt und/oder dass sie etwas politisch bewegen können.
Die ist übrigens bei schlechter Gebildeten niedriger als bei gut gebildeten Menschen. Und ein Aufgabenfeld, dass die Politik steuern kann, ist die Bildungspolitik. 
Was mich wieder dazu führt, dass die Politik (großteils) selbst dafür verantwortlich ist, wie es läuft.

Ich finde es übrigens interessant, dass du es wichtig findest, dass Menschen ihren Kindern ein Vorbild sein sollen, aber dass du nicht findest, dass Politikern Vorbilder für die Bürger sein sollten. Ist natürlich ein anderes Verhältnis, aber Poltiker sind schließlich den Bürgern verantwortlich.

Du vergisst übrigens noch einige andere Funktionen des BVerfG. Es urteilt ja nicht nur darüber, ob ein bestimmtes Gesetz verfassungskonform ist. Beispielsweise gibt es noch die Verfassungsbeschwerde, die von jedem Bürger eingereicht werden kann.

Generell gilt: Wo kein Kläger, da kein Richter. 

und

Wo kein verfassungswidriges Gesetz, da kein Kläger, da kein Verfassungsrichter.

Wenn die Politiker also einfach verfassungskonforme Gesetze erlassen, muss das Gericht weniger urteilen.

Wäre unsere Demokratie eine direkte(re) Demokratie, würde ich dir zustimmen, dass Bürger politisch aktiver sein müssten und ""ihr eigener Herr"" sind.

true,elafoc,null,null,"Hi !

Just saying, here in france the average milking farm is like 100 cows. In the US its more like 1000 cows :)
Definetly more welfare here imo.

The organic label is mostly about the use of antibiotics (there's a limit), the food (no genetically modified soja or whatever).

For cheese, as you know we have many varieties. They all have some AOC (appellation d'origine controlée). That means the milk used and the way the cheese is made conforms to some protocol. Like for an example, some cheese will need the cows to be feed only grass and derivates, to avoid holes or fermentation. And the other way round.
Basically, if you are buying cheese ""à la coupe"" (cut in front of you), or ""fermier"" it's often AOC.

here are the labels : http://www.fromages-aop-auvergne.com/IMG/jpg/aoc=aop.jpg

You'll have to be more explicit, I don't really understand your expectations about a certified humane.
But it is always ""humane"", there's no deliberate bad treatment or suffering as far as I know, and i'm in the veterinarian field. 

Edit : I looked up the US label :

The use of growth hormones and antibiotics is prohibited &gt; Growth hormones are STRICLY forbidden in Europe. Antibiotics are used, but you have a waiting time (when a cow gets antibiotics, you can't sell the milk for days or slaughter for human consuption the cow for days to months (depends on the drug) and the milk collected is systematically checked. if they find antibiotics in it, it just goes trash, the farmer isn't payed and sometimes even get penalties. so basically they are very careful about it)

Animals must be free to move and not be confined – Cages, crates and tie stalls are prohibited. This means that chickens are able to flap their wings and dust bathe, and pigs have the space to move around and root &gt; In France most cows spend half of the year outside in the grass fields and the otherhalf inside.

Livestock have access to sufficient, clean, and nutritious feed and water &gt; Well, i think this is a duty here, it's considered bad treatment otherwise

They must have sufficient protection from weather elements and an environment that promotes well being &gt; this is also legally needded

Managers and caretakers must be thoroughly trained, skilled and competent in animal husbandry and welfare, and have good working knowledge of their system and the livestock in their care. &gt; Farms are often inherited, but young generations tend to make real studies before taking up the farm.

That is a funny insult, considering that you advocate **economic intervention** to encourage savings.

&gt;If everybody would be making consumer goods, who would make the better tools?

What are you talking about? Where did I say that everybody should be making consumer goods? Consumers demand consumer goods, those who produce consumer goods demand tools they need for producing those goods, so lower demand for consumer goods also means lower demand for tools.

&gt;This means those people must be paid from savings. 

What people? People who produce better tools are paid by those who need better tools.



Who will produce goods if there is nobody to sell them to? Who will produce tools if there is nobody to sell them to?

While you will probably outperform a Uni MSc. in actually building something, you are very unlikely to get employment in areas such as R&amp;D, unless you have some major credentials in that area (relevant internships, worked in R&amp;D at the FH or the like).

The feeling of not having learned anything relevant is normal. It often helps to start listing in your head how ""few"" things you've learnt and you arrive at quite a lot.

If you do not have any internships, the praxissemester and thesis at the FH might be a bigger problem as you lack ""outside"" experience.

Also, be aware that jumping from a FH BSc. to a Uni MSc. might be quite a change as (afaik) the style of learning differ rather heavily.

Overall, I'd say it depends on what kind of job you are looking for. Being an engineer educated in Germany already gives you good job perspective. However, not having any internships/experiences outside of the Uni will lower your market value and not having a MSc. is likely to keep you out of higher ranking positions or interesting fields such as R&amp;D.

true,eddarval,PORT,Portugal,"&gt; Yes, but how ? Why would the government stop it ?

The how is the reason why I don't participate in these kind of things. They just make a lot of noise but add nothing to the conversation except saying ""I don't like this, so fix it"".

Regarding the ""Why,"" because the government is cutting pensions on people who worked their whole lives but now only recieve 300€ because before the revolution taxation was poorly documented if done at all. So now you have people who worked 50+ years (starting to work at the age of 12 was rather common at the time) and now only get enough money to buy their medicine, at best. But at the same time, because a few years back the government bough the banking pension fund, the state is paying thousands (between 20k and 75k) of euros in pensions to a few fellas who build absolutely nothing and just gambled with other people money. (Not  trying to pass make a point just explaining something).

Meanwhile we see the unemployment rising every month, and at least once a week there's a minister or someone connected to the government saying something stupid like ""if the beggars on the street can make it, so can the rest."" 

Adding to this, we don't really have an opposition in Portugal. Since the revolution there were 4 kinds of government. Either PS (Social Party), PSD (Social Democratic Party), or any combination of one of these in coalition. The CDS (""Christian"" Party/Popular) has in multiple occasions sided with the PSD (both, right wing on the portuguese spectrum) and it's seen just as a more of the same. On the other side we have the PCP (Portuguese Communist Party) and the BE (Left Block) which aren't real options because of how radical they are (the BE even more than the PCP). So we get what we have now, and for the last 15ish years (since Durão Barroso). The party in government says that cuts have to be done on education, health and social security, the oposition says no more cuts nor tax increses. Then the government party loses the election and the oposition gets to form government but now they say, oh wait, we need to cut on education, health and social security meanwhile the party that's now on the opposition says, ""no no no no, no more of that"". And while these things that are needed to the every day living of the population are getting cutted, we see Public/Pricate partnerships that never worked being done, old ministers getting high paying jobs on companies that got a good deal while that guy was minister, higher taxes, more cuts on education, health and social security and no real opposition. The pathetic thing is that it's LITERALLY like this.

Last election was won because of people were completely tired of our former prime minister and the current promised what we wanted to hear, but I'll give you an example of the political conversation in a typical Portuguese election:

When Durão Barroso left the Government and went to the European Commission, there was no need for elections so he was replaced by the number 2 of the party. Not exactly ok with this but this is not where I want to get to. Eventually he was fired. The next election the primary topic of discussion was what was the sexuality of one of the candidates, who to be honest, won because he was running against the guy who got fired (and was also rumoured to be gay, like anyone gives a crap).

And this is why people in Portugal complain. In 1974 our military got tired of the war and retired the regime, now there's no war but there's a huge mess and a lot of something that *can*, but will never be, called corruption.

Scherzi a parte: il mio **E' ASSOLUTAMENTE snobbismo al contrario**.

Il 90% della gente a cui ho fatto comprare un Mac poteva tranquillamente fare le stesse cose con un portatile o un fisso da 300-500 euro. Probabilmente anche con un Windows 7 mantenuto bene e sicuramente con un Ubuntu configurato da me e spiegato in un paio d'ore. Il fatto e' che spendere 1100 euro e passare a Mac era piu' facile per tutti.

Poi OSX e' BSD come mia nonna e' un cingolato. E' vero, il kernel e' derivato da BSD, ma a parte Webkit e CUPS cos'altro c'e' di open source? La politica di Apple e' la stessa di Google, di ecosistema chiuso, fatta di App Store, DRM ed Itunes. (Ed io Google lo uso con goduria).

Sul Mac della mia morosa non posso neanche installare Mountain Lion perche' secondo loro e' troppo vecchio e non me lo permettono. Magari hanno ragione, ma se voglio schienare una macchina sono cazzi miei.

Poi **la mia critica era legata all'individuo in questione**. Quello che ha scoperto internet e questo gli ha aperto la mente, condividiamo tutto, 1 vale 1, capitalismo merda, e poi si piscia addosso dentro ad un Apple Store.

E lo sai anche tu che almeno il 50% di chi compra Apple lo fa con le mutande bagnate.

Io lo ammetto senza problemi che il 90% di chi usa Linux e' un nerd fottuto, spesso dalla personalita' ""particolare"".

A short-termism which although popular, will do nothing to achieve any of their actual goals.

It is, after all, not the people receiving the bonuses fault they manipulated their operating environment in a manner which was both possible and legal (if it wasn't, it was a matter of enforcement, not pay).

If a business wishes to remunerate an employee for doing their job well, then good for them. If they wish to remunerate an employee for slacking off.... their choice.

Of course, where the government owns a percentage of the business then they should use their pull however they see fit.

But usually, it should be the people which enact change through their wallets, not through the EU. If you don't want a banks board to receive such a bonus, then don't bank with them.

Why not? Do you think the only alternative to demand-side intervention is laissez faire and never heard of supply-side interventions? That would be strange given that throughout history they were more frequent.

&gt;What are you talking about? Where did I say that everybody should be making consumer goods? Consumers demand consumer goods, those who produce consumer goods demand tools they need for producing those goods, so lower demand for consumer goods also means lower demand for tools.

You have 100 people on an island. Each can produce consumer goods or tools. Assuming a model of no unemployment, 10% savings means 90 people making consumer goods and 10 making tools (they are paid from the income of the 90 consumer good makers, they save 10% of it, got that?) and so on. The less demand for consumer goods means the more people employed in tools i.e. making the consumer good makers more efficient because we assumed full employment so savings automatically mean moving workers from consumer goods to tools. So in our model there literally cannot be such a thing as low demand for both, or in other words demand does not matter, people will just make consumer goods, make tools, and will just barter or drop their price or whatever until all is used. Understood so far? Clear? So we have a logical model although not realistic. This is what I meant think harder. Forget money, demand, focus on real stuff, work, and goods. Assuming no unemployment demand does not matter, stuff will be made and then distributed anyhow because why stockpile them.

Now we can introduce unemployment in the model. It is clear to see demand matters only so far as unemployment matters. In a model with unemployment it could happen that there is a lower demand for goods, also a lower demand for tools, and people sit around doing nothing. And earning nothing, which creates even lower demand.

Thus, this can warrant demand-side intervention if and when high unemployment exists, this is normal, nonvulgar Keynesianism. (Note that even demand-side intervention can be supply-increasing and that is a clever thing: infrastructure public works reduce transaction costs for businesses making supply higher etc. ) But there is no such thing as a general systematic lack of demand or a general systematic damage caused by savings. Savings can be damaging only so far that it causes unemployment. In near full employment is not damaging, it causes progress. In near full employment, no savings would mean no progress, because it would mean every worker makes consumer goods and no tools because the toolmakers are paid from savings. So the tools just crumble without maintenance. So it is even dangerous. So if you see 5% unemployment and 15% savings... then 2/3 of those savings are perfectly OK. 

Consider near full employment and no savings. It means you work, earn €100, and then buy €100 consumer goods. If everybody does this, it means everybody works on making consumer goods and the machines go without maintenance. Because if you want to pay 1 person to maintain the machine or pay a better one, it means 10 consumer goods making workers must earn €100 but spend only €90 on consumption and save and invest €10 to pay the other dude. (Or that can be done by a capitalist from profits or by the state from taxes. Anyway, same aggregate picture).

The whole lack of demand thing only makes sense with relation to unemployment.

So this is how a logical model seems like.

**[DIE ZEIT](http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2013-02/wasser-stadtwerke-privatisierung-eu-kommission/komplettansicht)** states:
&gt;Wenn Bürgermeister in Zukunft auf die Idee kommen, ihr Wasserwerk zu verkaufen, dann müssen sie ihr Vorhaben in ganz Europa ausschreiben. Darum geht es in Barniers Richtlinie.

&gt;**Das bedeutet aber nicht, dass die Kommunen gezwungen sind, ihre Wasserwerke zu privatisieren**, betont Barnier immer wieder.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Auch Barnier betont, die geplante Richtlinie beeinträchtige die Autonomie der Städte und Gemeinden bei der Organisation der Wasserversorgung nicht im Geringsten. ""In Wirklichkeit tut die Richtlinie genau das Gegenteil. Sie verpflichtet Gebietskörperschaften, ein faires und transparentes Verfahren durchzuführen, **wenn sie im Rahmen ihrer Autonomie die Entscheidung getroffen haben, die Wasserversorgung am Markt zu vergeben oder zu privatisieren.**""

So this change doesn't *force* any municipality to privatize their water supply, it only states that **if they decide to privatize it** (which has already been done for years in some places) they have to advertise it in all of Europe instead of just giving it to a local company.

**Potential benefits of this:**

* More competition (higher quality and lower prices, theoretically at least)
* More transparency

**Potential disadvantages of this:**

* Business tax doesn't go back to the municipality if the water supplier isn't a local company

* A non-local water supplier's board of director's most likely won't consist of local politicians anymore who could influence the company in the municipality's interests

Il sandboxing isola le singole applicazioni dal contesto in modo che non possano fare danni, volontariamente o involontariamente.

I have. Did you know that ""supply side economics"" was invented in the US during Reagan? It's an ideology, it was never based on a solid economic theory.

&gt; Assuming a model of no unemployment, 10% savings means 90 people making consumer goods and 10 making tools

Why? I don't see any reason why it should be the case.

&gt;(they are paid from the income of the 90 consumer good makers, they save 10% of it, got that?)

What? I have no idea what you are trying to say here.

&gt; The less demand for consumer goods means the more people employed in tools i.e. making the consumer good makers more efficient because we assumed full employment so savings automatically mean moving workers from consumer goods to tools.

Why do you think so? You keep asserting things without giving any justification for your beliefs.

&gt;So in our model there literally cannot be such a thing as low demand for both, or in other words demand does not matter, people will just make consumer goods, make tools, and will just barter or drop their price or whatever until all is used.

Why should people keep producing goods if they can't sell them profitably?

&gt;no tools because the toolmakers are paid from savings


You still haven't explained why you think so.

&gt;Consider near full employment and no savings. It means you work, earn €100, and then buy €100 consumer goods. If everybody does this, it means everybody works on making consumer goods and the machines go without maintenance. Because if you want to pay 1 person to maintain the machine or pay a better one, it means 10 consumer goods making workers must earn €100 but spend only €90 on consumption and save and invest €10 to pay the other dude.

I can't even comprehend how you could get to such an absurd condition. Why should producers of consumer goods let their machines go without maintenance? What you write makes absolutely no sense.

I'll repeat that in a different way: The fundamental premise of Capitalism is full and correct information about the market. Regular citizens (known as ""consumers"") don't have that, and never will, which is why they will *always* get the short end of the stick. Essentially, the self-regulating aspect of capitalism is defunct in any complex market, and this will inevitably lead to its structural failure unless kept in check by regulation.

*Spaniards are obsessed with olive oil. One of my professors told me that she fills a water bottle with olive oil and takes swigs throughout the day. When I had a sore throat, someone recommended that I drink spoonfuls of olive oil. It's on all of the food, too. 

*Spaniards are very particular about cold weather. I study in Oviedo where it is around 40-60 degrees (the weather changes often), and if I don't wear a scarf around my neck (even when it's 60+ degrees), the Spaniards freak out and tell me that I'm going to get sick. Apparently, the belief here is that your neck is the most important part of your body to keep warm. Beyond that, they pretty much cover every part of there body below their head when it's less than like, 65 degrees out. I'm talking turtleneck shirts under vests, gloves, shoes with high socks so that your feet are covered, etc.

*My host-mom keeps the house freezing. Even when it's 50 degrees outside, the heat is off and the expectation is just to wear more clothes inside. Also, you can never ever walk around the house barefoot, and usually not in just socks either. You must wear shoes or slippers.

*In the grocery stores, there is pretty much no frozen meals or microwave meals. There are bags of chips and some cookies, but other than that, pretty much everything is fresh. The stores are pretty small because it's mostly just fresh ingredients that you buy to cook a meal yourself. The only time I've seen frozen pizzas or microwave processed foods were in Salamanca which is a college town. 


*Coffee all the time. In the morning, in the middle of the day, at night. A whole packet of sugar in each cafe con leche. 

*Siesta. From 2-4ish everyone goes home for lunch and relaxes/naps.

*When I went to the doctor when I had a sore throat, he did not weigh me, take my temperature, or do any sort of test for strep throat. He just looked in my throat for a few seconds, felt my neck, and then gave me antibiotics. I was pretty unsure about taking them since he didn't spend very long examining me, but the sore throat went away so I'm going to assume he's just an awesome doctor that knows exactly what he's doing.

*there are so many more things...

We have a simplified model where there is no unemployment and no profits and no taxes and no inflation and everybody is just self-employed. We have 100 people making consumer goods, selling to each other, and circulating 10000 coins amongst each other. Everybody makes consumer goods, sells them for 100 coins, spends the 100 coins on other consumer goods, savings rate is 0%. Suddenly someone realizes that a machine needs to be maintained or repaired or maybe a newer one built. Who will do it? Someone will have to stop producting consumer goods and start doing this. This means we have the same demand for consumer goods, but less quantity of them, temporarily I mean, OK? Because this dude now does something else.  But we still want this dude to eat, to generally consume, so that means everybody else has to consume a bit less, OK? So that they leave some food, clothes, beer for him. OK? If everybody keeps spending their 100 coins on the consumer goods they make there is nothing left for him. It means now everybody will just spend 99 coins on consumer goods. And they will consume a bit less. And they will pay 1 coins each to this dude. So he has money now, and he can spend it on the consumer goods while he is working on that machine. The consumer goods he buys come from other people consuming less. They consume less by spending less coins on consumer goods. They spend less on consumer goods by paying that coin to this guy. So the two sides of the economy, money and goods, comes nicely together. On one hand, coins are saved by everybody else, and given to this dude. On the other hand, consumer goods are saved, in the sense of other people not buying all of them, but leaving some to this dude. They made this leaving by not spending all their income but giving some to this dude. And this dude gets the leftover goods by spending the money the others gave. This money saved and given to this guy is called savings and investments. They as a society invested this money, or these consumer goods, into getting a machine repair or a better one made. Without such savings that work will not be done, partially because there is no money to pay that guy and there is nothing he can spend it on, because the other folks consumed everything.

Cereals is also a popular breakfast item, usually alongside the sandwich(es). Sometimes it's eaten with milk, but sometimes we eat it with a type of fermented milk called *filmjölk*.

2. L'idea che qualunque decisione ""popolare"" sia giusta. Abbiamo un sistema rappresentativo proprio per questo: per evitare che sia il semplice numero a decidere, perché altrimenti le azioni impopolari o che tutelano una minoranza non se le fila nessuno.

3. Che tutto debba essere una scelta sottoposta all'approvazione di tutti. Nessuno si segnerebbe di far votare se una certa operazione cardiaca andrebbe fatta nel modo A o nel modo B. Allo stesso modo credo che alcune scelte tecniche andrebbero lasciate ai tecnici.

You either don't, whereby you pay for everything using your PP balance, or you get a PayPal credit card (I will assume). Bare in mind there are currency services which accept PP.

BTC can be exchanged for cash provided you can find someone locally to buy your BTC. There are plenty of people doing this near London, for example.

The Commission is concerned that through the tying, Microsoft shields Internet Explorer from head to head competition with other browsers which is detrimental to the pace of product innovation and to the quality of products which consumers ultimately obtain.

* Employment (which will give whether public/private)
* Home ownership
* Do you have kids
* Post code
* Party voted for in last Holyrood election (constituency vote)
* Do you support independence
* National identity
* Country of birth

Then the survey questions;

* Do you think there should be a referendum on EU membership?
* If there was a referendum now how would you vote?
* If Scotland was independent should it be a member?

Wouldn't take long - the only bits that would take some time is the employment question as you may have to do a bit of probing and the identity one where you would probably have to read out the choices. Some people um and ah and that can add a minute or two. 7-8 minutes tops.

I'm not interested in living in an all white area. Seriously, we're miserable bastards. More than that, we're miserable Yorkshire bastards. We are dour and do not talk to each other much.

Until I moved in to my current house, which I bought because my very good friends live in the house next door, the only neighbours I ever received Christmas cards from were muslims. To this day the only neighbours to come to my door, introduce themselves and make gifts of food have been muslims. On the all-white council estates I grew up on, and first lived in when I had a place of my own, I rarely interacted with any neighbours at all except to explain that I had no interest in fighting them.

No. Budget heading ""Smart and Inclusive Growth"" is the biggest with about 47% share of EU budget, please see the links I provided. Indeed CAP is not what EU ""does the most"" and arguing that would be disingenuous.

&gt; And how much money does France receive compared to other countries?

2010 in millions € and share of CAP: [Statistical factsheets - Agriculture in the European Union and the Member States](http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/analysis/perspec/background/index_en.htm#SMT)

1. France - 9 963 (17%)
2. Spain - 7 175 (12%)
3. Germany - 6 896 (12%)
4. Italy - 6 200 (11%)
5. Poland - 4 355 (7%)
6. UK - 4 052 (7%)

EDIT: 2010 total CAP expenditure was 58 146.

&gt; Is it still the biggest CAP beneficiary?

Depends on how one calculates. In absolute numbers yes. Then again France has by far the biggest agricultular output in EU: [see this graph](http://i.imgur.com/fcp2DzH)

In other words France received about 17% of CAP and at the same time it's output was over 18%. By those numbers your notion of ""inefficient French farmers"" seems to apply better to UK farmers - but I guess that would be splitting the hairs.

People adore napkins.  I've never seen so much napkin usage as here.  In between most every bite, people wipe their face.  They may have a point, because my glass is always disgusting (and my beer flat) and theirs aren't.

I've never noticed this neck-thing. It's interesting.
Most people prefer muted colors.  When I wear super bright red pants, I get a lot of stares on the street and negative comments from my friends/colleagues.

My friends and their families keep their houses *boiling hot*  - I've not seen the thermostat go below 25C, and that's the 'cool' setting for sleepytime.  I've gotten used to it and will likely have no subcutaneous layer of fat any more.  When I go back home to Amsterdam, I am forever freezing.

And yes, most people wear shoes inside, but then again, I'm used to that myself.  I've never understood all that barefootedness in the US.

The grocery stores have terrible shit and lots of it.  Tons of frozen, microwaveable meals of sinister origins.  You certainly don't *have* to buy this as the same shops (or right around the corner) have amazing quality, fresh, healthy food.  But boy, there is a ton of crap, too.

Coffee: yeah, but people shouldn't think that a river of Starbucks water is the same stuff people drink here.  Coffee here is tasty and the cups tiny.  Tea seems to be getting more popular - slowly.

Never seen much sugar usage in coffee.  In very acidic fresh orange-juice though, I have seen people dump avalanches of sugar.  This shocked me the first time I witnessed this.

Siesta - even though most shops and many offices will be closed for a few hours, this practice has clearly been declining over the years.  There are big big lunches, but rarely napping and certainly not the amounts of wine there used to be.

true,Omnilatent,null,null," &gt; Weil es das Gesetz ist, und weil es eine Selbstverständlichkeit ist, dass man sich an Gesetze, zumal legitime, bedingungslos zu halten hat. Wer Zusatzbedingungen wie ""Die Politiker müssen auch alle gesetzestreu sein"" fordert, erzeugt damit einen Dammbruch, denn andere können für sich ebenso die Erfüllung beliebiger Zusatzbedingungen fordern. So kann man nicht argumentieren, ohne das Tor zur Hölle zu öffnen.

Wie bereits oben erwähnt gibt es aber genug Politiker, die sich **nicht** an Gesetze halten. Und ich wähle doch nicht für Menschen, die sich wie absolutistische Herrscher über dem Gesetz sehen.

&gt; Wenn Du also von den Politikern Integrität forderst, dann musst Du sie umso mehr von anderen Wählern fordern.

Was hat die Integrität der Bürger nun mit niedrigem politischen Interesse zu tun? Ich habe das ja in die Diskussion eingebracht, weil Menschen das Gefühl haben, dass viele Politiker A sagen und B machen und das negativen Einfluss auf die Zufriedenheit der Bürger hat und Bürger auch dadurch weniger Interesse haben bzw. weniger gewillt sind, sich mit Politik zu beschäftigen.

&gt; Aus dem Mangel an diesem Gefühl ergibt sich für mich aber nicht eine Entbindung von der Pflicht, mich politisch zu informieren.

Wir reden hier ein bisschen aneinander vorbei. Aus meiner Sicht verdrehst du die Ursache und Wirkung. Für mich kam erst schlechte Politik die dann zu weniger politischem Interesse etc geführt hat und für dich ist es umgekehrt.
Es geht uns ja hier um die Qualität der Demokratie. Und die ist eben besonders groß bzw. größer, wenn Menschen diese *political efficacy* besitzen. Der Wählerrückgang der letzten Dekaden wird übrigens in der Fachliteratur oft (auch) über die politische Wirksamkeit erklärt.

Und meiner Meinung nach enthält das Recht, wählen zu gehen (und sich darüber zu informieren) auch implizit das Recht nicht wählen zu gehen (und sich nicht zu informieren). Von einer Pflicht kann man also meiner Meinung nach nicht sprechen. 

&gt; Moralität ist für mich genau wie Bildung unabhängig vom Handeln anderer Leute, weil sie beide für mich durch den Anspruch, ein besserer Mensch zu werden, konstitutiert sind.

Man muss aber erst einmal zu dem Punkt kommen, diesen Anspruch zu entwickeln. Und das hat damit zu tun, in was für ein Umfeld man geboren wird und das kann man sich eben nicht aussuchen. Beispielsweise wird Kindern in bildungsnahen Familien stets mitgeteilt, wie wichtig Bildung ist - die von bildungsfernen Familien werden so etwas kaum hören. Es ist nicht alleinig die Schuld der Menschen, dass sie nicht diesen Anspruch haben. 

Gäbe es eine ordentliche Bildungspolitik würden mehr Menschen erkennen, dass Bildung gut ist und beispielsweise studieren nicht nur für ""Streber"" oder so etwas. Aber stattdessen wird Schülern in der Hauptschule beigebracht, wie man einen Hartz IV-Antrag ausfüllt, weil sie es ja ""sowieso zu nichts bringen"".
Vielleicht kennst du die Fabel mit dem Fuchs und den Trauben. Da passiert hier das gleiche. Weil man als Schüler eingebläut bekommt, dass man sowieso für alles ""zu dumm"" ist, denkt man sich dann, dass Bildung Humbug ist (Stichwort kognitive Dissonanz).

Dein Artikel über einen Vorfall in Afrika passt nicht so ganz in unsere Diskussion über das politische System Deutschlands.

Politiker sind insofern dem Volk verpflichtet, als dass sie in der nächsten Wahl wieder abgewählt werden können. Der Sinn ihrer Existenz ist ja eigentlich, dass Leben aller Bürger zu verbessern. Natürlich sind sie nur ihrem Gewissen verpflichtet. Aber das Problem, dass sich hierbei ergeben kann und dass sich regelmäßig ergibt ist, dass Entscheidungen getroffen werden, für die Politiker nicht zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden können.
Beispiel Flughafen Berlin, S21 oder die Elbphilharmonie: Da beschließen Politiker etwas und wenn die Kosten explodieren ist der Steuerzahler der Blöde, nicht aber der Politiker. Ich will nicht sagen, dass man jetzt ein Gesetz ändern soll, aber die Einstellung der Politiker muss sich ändern. Die müssen sich wieder verantwortlich für etwas fühlen und nicht nur permament vor sich hin brabbeln, dass ""Gremium XY"" oder ""Brüssel"" für irgendeine schlechte Entwicklung zuständig seien.

Da kommt dann aber natürlich das Problem mit dem Parteienlisten wieder ins Spiel. Weil die Parteien diese Listen machen wird auch ein Politiker wieder in das Parlament kommen, obwohl er ""nur scheiße"" fabriziert hat.

&gt; Die Frage, die Du Dir stellen solltest, ist, warum Politiker glauben, dass es akzeptabel ist, solche Gesetze zu erlassen. Es ist ja nicht so, dass die Wähler Regierungsparteien, die verfassungswidrige Gesetze erlassen haben, abstrafen.

Tja, das wüsst ich auch gern. Menschen haben anscheinend ein mieses Gedächtnis...

&gt; Wie sollen Wähler in einer direkt(er)en Demokratie besser performen, wenn sie es noch nicht einmal schaffen, das bestehende politische Dickicht zu durchdringen? Es ist ja nicht so, dass die Informationslast dann sinken würde.

Die Informationslast sinkt natürlich nicht. Aber das Gefühl, etwas zu bewirken steigt. Weil man die Leute nach ihrer Meinung fragt. Und das steigert dann die Qualität der Demokratie.

Das kann natürlich auch zu einer Überlastung des politischen Systems führen und das ist ein wichtiger Punkt.
Ist es überhaupt wünschenswert, dass **(fast) alle** Bürger permanent ins politische System eingreifen wollen oder ist es vielleicht klüger, wenn sie das zum Großteil bei Wahlen machen?

Eigentlich ging die Diskussion ja darüber, ob man sich als Bürger zu sehr auf das BVerfG verlässt. Ich denke ja - aber auch zurecht.
Dafür wurde das BVerfG geschaffen, damit so eine Scheiße wie in der Weimarer Republik nie wieder passieren kann.
Die Verfassung ist unser höchstes Gut in Deutschland und es ist gut und wichtig, dass es eine Institution gibt, die (relativ) schnell verfassungswidrige Gesetze für nichtig erklären kann.

I agree there are some problems with the EU, but the freedom of travel and erosion of borders (which we see less, as we aren't in the Schengen area, stupidly) are incredibly important for helping to erode nationalism.

I'm also an Esperantist, and if you look at the history of Esperanto and Europe, the EU really is an incredible step forward.

I never claimed to. All I did was put into words the actual results from actual elections in Scotland - where Scotland spoke for itself.

As to comparisons; as I tried to explain you need a representative Scottish sample to be able to make the comparison. That is why the Scottish Public Attitudes &amp; Opinion Monitor is so important as it is one of the few regular surveys that has a large enough Scottish sample (100% of 1,003) for it to be safely used. If you make the comparison between two surveys carried out by the same company, you at least know the methodology was the same. You are also aware in any difference between the timing of the fieldwork - for which you can make allowances in interpretation.

If you make a comparison between two different companies - you have two different methodologies - you just can't do it. As I explained to guernican, Ipsos Mori uses random digit dialing. YouGov use panels (subsets of the same people, survey after survey) or they are done online (self-selecting sample). You cannot make a valid comparison.

In the industry YouGov are referred to as ""Anything You Want Gov"" - not exactly highly regarded.

And just in case you are wondering, I am no Ipsos Mori shill. I got fired for telling the boss, who I hadn't previously met, that if he didn't want to be mistaken for one of the interviewers (as I had just done) he should probably dress in a more professional manner.

Here's one I googled - it says agriculture is the second largest share (and it's been the largest historically), of which France in turn takes the largest share of that.

It certainly is... which is why when you say France has the biggest output I can say that probably isn't the entire picture thanks to wine and butter over-production. You're right it's being phased out, then we'll be able to see the real picture.

Usually it's two hours a week until university (unless the school is a sports school). 

It usually doesn't count for college. Universities are most often asking for the main subjects (languages, maths, physics etc.)

Theoretical component? Usually not, but it really depends on who is teaching it and how. In my primary and secondary school we learned game rules and some theory about healthy lifestyle.

In university-level education PhysEd is optional but schools often offer wide variety of classes. Among them are self-defense (which I would not call not-so-sporty!

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; on Ubuntu I am forced to use APT package manager to perform a system upgrade/update

This bit of EU competition law focuses on *abuse* of a *dominant position*. Ubuntu isn't really in a *dominant position* in any market (and if it were, presumably MS wouldn't be), and bundling (i.e. the APT package manager with Ubuntu) isn't always *abuse* - it usually has to go further by causing detriment to another party (usually consumers).

&gt; Should Canonical be fined for not promoting RPM?

MS didn't have to promote other browsers because EU competition law says it must, but because it was being investigating for unfairly-bundling/promoting IE with Windows, and came to an agreement with the Commission by which it could keep doing so provided it also promoted other browsers. MS wasn't forced to promote them.

&gt; Users might be unaware of many things. This is why advertisement was invented.

Which is where we get to the *abuse* point. The argument (as I understand it) was that MS was abusing its monopoly over the *desktop OS market* (see below) to promote IE. It wasn't that MS was advertising it better, or had produced a better product, but this unfair abuse of position that was causing IE to do so well.

&gt; IE holds a minority share in the browser market anyway

Firstly, it wasn't the browser market, but the desktop OS market that was the relevant *dominant position* MS was abusing. And I'm pretty certain MS is still has an effective monopoly there.

Secondly, this investigation/settlement was in 2009; according to that page in 2008-09 IE had a 60-70% share. Looking at the map (showing IE still in a majority in North America) I wonder how much of the subsequent decrease is due to MS having to promote other browsers?

This is essentially what happened to iTunes with Spotify.

You're not paying close attention, though — you can't compare all business areas with all other business areas. As I've said a couple of times, some industries benefit from competition, because competition is a real possibility. Others don't. The music selling and distribution market is one that *does* benefit from competition. Entrepreneurship is one that might (which is why such public investments are made by open tender). Ownership of infrastructure is not necessarily.

&gt; Government is a business

No, it really isn't. There are some parallels, and some very important differences — the primary being influence. Governments are run by democracies and for the people. Businesses are run by the board and for the shareholders. Citizens are not shareholders — if they were, the weight of your vote would depend on your tax bracket.

Come back to reality, please. How do you distribute water without pipes, say? How do you maintain a controlled purification process to eliminate contamination? How do you switch water providers if the only company that has pipes in your neighborhood is exploiting its customers/not purifying properly/not doing its job to your expectation?

There are a hell of a lot areas that are not bound to see significant innovation anytime soon, and meanwhile you are *perfectly free* to start a company that innovates with the aim of selling your innovations to the public provider of said service.

You can only use websites that are compatible with your browser. Standards for html and related technologies (in which people code websites) improve all the time, but old versions of browsers don't implement new features, and don't fix bugs after a certain point. For decade ie6 had so huge marketshare, that all websites had to write websites with ie6 in mind (and that meant - writing the website 2 times or not using new features, dumbing down the website, making it easier to bypass security, and many other drawbacks - that was not because ie6 was so bad, but because ie6 was OLD browser). Then firefox happened, was free and so much faster that people eventually switched, and the situation slowly changed. Websites all over the world finally could start to use imporvements from the previous 10 years. Now we have similar situation with webkit engine - more and more browsers use the same browser engine, and many websites start to assume you use webkit-based browser. That is a BAD THING, no matter if it's Microsoft that makes the only browser, or anybody else. Monoculture is bad for customers and for the whole market in the long run.

Whether Microsoft should pay or not - I don't know, that's more about law and contracts. But we should remember how monopoly of one browser freezed the development of modern internet for decade, and never allow it to happen again (the most probably new monopolist - Apple).

I used to study Computer Science. Almost entirely guys in my year. They would mostly talk about women in terms of how many sandwiches they'd make them, or how one was a ""5"" while another was an ""8"". The assumption about girls entering the field was always that she did it for the attention, and certainly that she didn't actually really know what she was doing. I don't know if you've ever worked in male-dominated field, but this stuff is detrimental to the well-being of the females that do want to pursue those careers, so again it's not really that surprising that they just avoid it.

The *Education Physique et Sportive* (Sport and physical education, commonly called EPS) is obligatory throughout primary school, college and lycée (high school), so roughly from age 6 to 18.  
In primary school there are various sports, swimming, tennis, gymnastics, running. If the school or the town has the facilities for specific sports, they can be taught (I did fencing in prim school). It's usually 3 hours a week with the regular teacher or a dedicated one. Usually grades are assigned according to defined objectives (for example, running 100m in less than 20s: 1pt - in less than 17s: 2pts - in less than 15s: 3 pts, etc) Usually the final grade is either out of 10 or a letter for young kids so that a bad grade doesn't penalise them.  
  
  
  
College: mostly the same sports, usually there is more track &amp; field stuff (long jump, endurance running, disc throwing...) and collective sports (handball, badminton...). The year is cut in 3 parts (trimesters), so for example you'll do 2 sports for the 1st trimester, 2 others for the 2nd, etc. Once again, if there are facilities for it, schools can offer stuff like kayaking or climbing. I remember doing dancing or circus arts too (and I hated it :/). 3/4 hours a week always with a dedicated teacher that holds a diploma for it. Again, it's scored according to levels and you get a grade out of 20 that counts towards your global grade.  
  

Lycée: mostly the same as college. A wide variety of sports. Trimesters system with a rotation in activities chosen (not all classes do the same things during the year). Mostly the same system for grades. 2 hours a week for 3 years. At the end of lycee (3rd year, age 18) you must pass the baccalauréat diploma, where you get grades on all classes, so sports is part of it, but it is the only class where you are graded throughout the year (no special thing at the end of the year), and students get to chose a 3 sport set from a pre-determined list, so kinda like cable channels, for example if you want badminton, you also have to do running and gymnastics. You can also chose an extra sport as an option, and it is counted as a separate grade (out of 20, only points above 10 are counted), and once again, weird sports are allowed in some places, lucky bastards in the South of France can pick surfing as an option :(  
  
Regarding the theoretical component, not so much, sometimes you may get a written test about the sports rules, or safety practices/good sportsmanship, but it's only a very small part of the grade.

Thanks for conceding a point in a civilised manner, although I have to point out that it's sad how often man-related examples are needed before most male redditors will even consider the possibility that something similar might be affecting women…

&gt; The feeling of possibly being harrassed != being harrassed. We have employment tribunals to deal with this shit.

That's completely true — however, the fear of harassment still impacts the choices made by those people. For instance, if a gay man doesn't go to certain neighbourhoods with his boyfriend, for fear of violence, that man is not free, and that is a problem.

The truth is that sexual harassment still isn't at all inconceivable even in the most highly educated strata of our society. It's very hard to legislate about, but it's easy to take a stand and be inclusive as an individual, as a school, or as a business.

&gt; So you're claiming there's a systemic bias towards males which is undetectable enough that it can't be fought by discrimation laws and tribunals yet obvious enough that women are systemically being turned down for jobs on the basis of their gender?

It isn't at all undetectable — but that doesn't mean it's possible to legislate on it, without severely infringing on basic rights.

I hosted a Latvian couch-surfer and he told me that in some ways at least, it was wonderfully nostalgic to visit Minsk because it reminded him of his childhood.

true,Bear4188,UNSA,United States,"Firstly, almost all educational standards in the United States vary from state to state, with only relatively low national standards introduced fairly recently.

That said here's what I remember for California:

It's taught from grades 3-10 (ages 9-16ish). In elementary school (K-5) it was once a week for 45-60 minutes, in middle school (6-8) it was daily for about 50 minutes, and in high school (9-12) it was 2-3 times a week for 90 minutes for half the year (basically a full period in a [block schedule] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_scheduling) ). 

The required curriculum covers a wide range of activities. From what I remember there's a standardized test of sorts for things like running a mile, flexed arm hangs, stretches which are not pass-fail but participation is required and results are recorded. More generally it's required to touch on a number of different types of activities: team sports, dancing type stuff, both indoor and outdoor sports. Basically a really quick survey of a wide variety of sports.

I do remember a few theory things. Some of it general health, some of it super basic kinesiology, some of it learning the rules of whatever sport we're doing at the time.

In middle school and high school it's a full class which counts towards your GPA. Getting a poor grade will get you in trouble, barred from student activities, etc. High school graduation requires passing two years of PE. That said, the grade is pretty much solely based on participation on effort, you're not required to actually be physically fit or a great athlete in any way. It goes somewhat without saying, however, that people who aren't physically fit will sometimes refuse to do things and then get a crappy grade. I can't imagine any college cares about it in regards to admissions, except maybe, *maybe* that Fs would be a sign of poor self discipline. There is the matter of the US's rather unique collegiate and high school sports systems, but that's another topic and for that PE would be such a hilariously low standard anyway.

edit: as an aside I recall that in some countries there's a pretty large portion of the population with little to no swimming ability. Young kids are usually taught to swim here as toddlers or young kids. There is an additional aquatics segment in high school.

The European Parliament forms a government which proposes the legislation (and the Parliament votes on it), and the European Commission (your appointed representatives for each state) is the upper house who votes for or against the legislation.

It's very unclear how they're defining important. They might be using it in terms of how many transactions are done in it, or they might not. There are a variety of ways to make Euro rank highly as a currency and many more to make it look bad. Same is true of most currencies. To me, measuring the ""importance"" of a currency is like debating the colour of the grass or sky. 90% of the time, it'll be a nice shade of blue/grey and there'll be no determining which is a nicer shade due to every ones idea of the ideal being different.
