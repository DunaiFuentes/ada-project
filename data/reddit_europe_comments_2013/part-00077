The difference is that UK stamp duty is old, doesn't have much impact and the markets have learnt to live with it.

The new FTT will be huge, applying globally as it will to the instruments of France, Germany, Italy and Spain plus seven other European economies.   

It will be another deep cut to an already bleeding european financial landscape and its benefits will be out of all proportion to the damage done.

As such it is likely to be in breach of international commitments to free trade, proportionality, and limitations on the interference in other peoples' jurisdictions.

- Methane synthesized from CO2 (of the air) and water using electricity. You can feed that stuff into the ""natural"" gas grid which acts like a storage of its own. You can use high temperature fuel cells to turn the chemical energy in the gas back into electricity.

- Batteries

Of course you'd also use pumped hydro.

Southern Europe has lots and lots of sun. What we desperately need here would be some high capacity, long haul north-south transmission lines. Technologically feasible, but they cost money and it's politics.

...I'll leave calculating purchasing power parity to the reader.

As comparison: Social security payments, which are the socio-cultural existence minimum, are 380 Euros *plus* rent *plus* heating. Usually, that's more.

The only stop-gap is that you may not be paid less than 1/3rd of the mean of what's paid for the same job in the same region, which, in principle, means that if the mean is 10 cents per hour you have the right to be paid at least 3.3.

Exactly, which means that, if personal net wealth were identical, it's expected for countries with smaller households to have less net wealth per household.  
Therefore household net wealth is not representative of ""how rich the average (mean or median)"" person is.

Not the ""way"" I handled it, just ""that"" I handled it. Working with radioactive samples is all safety first, because this shit can really crap you up.

&gt; I just maintain that for the geologically short time span that we need to advance our technology enough

The nuclear waste will be still around then. Heck here in Germany we currently have problems retrieving all the waste from a experimental explorative nuclear waste disposal site called the Asse, which was never intended to be a real nuclear waste disposal site. It should be tested how the explored geological formation would react on the construction methods used to move nuclear waste in, and what effect the high radiation levels themself would have. The whole thing has become leaky after less than 30 years. And turns out to be really, really hard to get all the waste out of there to prevent it to get into the environment. After only a mere 30 years.

The amount of nuclear waste we already have (about 200kT worldwide) around is scary on its own. We don't need some extra hundreds of kT in addition.

&gt; it might be wiser to rely on nuclear power a bit more than fossil fuels.

No, it would not be. Instead of building new nuclear power plants, we should focus on not produce more of this shit. And please don't throw that molten metal thorium breeder reactor thing of MIT at me, that circled the Internet a few weeks ago and the supposedly could by burn nuclear waste. Newsflash: That thing has been proposed for well over 20 years and construction of an older design sodium cooled breeder reactor was never finished in Germany, because it was realized that these things operating are a ticking time bombs.

Also by dissolving nuclear fuel into the coolant you got the problem that your coolant itself becomes highly radioactive. Basically the fuel (which is heavy metal) and the coolant (which is a alkali metal) will form a liquid alloy. How would you even start to separate this? Chemical separation? Throwing the sodium into water to produce a solution of radioactive metal compounds in a NaOH lye that's highly corrosive? WTF?

The more ""advanced"" nuclear technology becomes, the scarier it gets.

Heck even neutronic fusion power produces quite an amount of radioactive waste: The neutron catcher blankets (which are used to extract the head by neutron absorption, i.e. catching neutrons into cores, thereby making them radioactive by design, not as a byproduct, to not only collect the direct kinetic heat, but also the heat from the short half-life decays), which must be replaced every few years after operation. So shall it be aneutronic fusion? Where do you get the ³He from? The Moon?

Frankly the whole concept of nuclear power production is lunatic. The sun gives us something between 1 kW/m² to 1.4 kW/m² of power for free. All we have to do is collecting it.

If you put this into proportion the sun casts more power onto the area a typical nuclear power plant occupies, than the nuclear power plant itself produces from nuclear fission.",0,1366462351,null,0,false,0,c9j1jrg,t3_1cnmul,t1_c9j1jrg,t1_c9j19s2,null,1431491130,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

The whole idea of collateral is to be able to reclaim the money should the debt not be paid. So if the people default and the bank forecloses, the legal obligation to pay should stop. The people were irresponsible, but the banks are at the very least equally irresponsible and faced the exact same risk of default.

Da una vita sopporto con fatica di vivere in un Paese, in un tempo, tra gente le cui regole mi erano all'inizio incomprensibili; e quando ho iniziato a comprenderle, mi sono diventate intollerabili. Da una vita vedo nella forma ipocrisia, e nella sostanza il saccheggio avido e senza vergogna di tutto quello che è pubblico, ed il pugno di ferro quando anche non la morte, per mano di sbirro in piazza o di sicario anonimo, di tanti che cercavano di mantenere un principio di legalità o di giustizia sociale.

Poi ho visto il crollo di una classe dirigente modellata sulle esigenze della guerra fredda, e l'emergere di nuovi potenti, peggiori dei precedenti se possibile. Ho visto vent'anni di strafottenza berlusconiana e di pietosa complicità di quelli che sembravano essere gli eredi del PCI - che non ho mai sostenuto, ma che era comunque tanto migliore di questa banda raccogliticcia di mendicanti mediocri anche nel male.

Ora vedo questa terribile classe dirigente disfarsi, senza che nessuno paghi per un Paese stuprato, per un'Italia povera ed ignorante che poteva essere ben altro. Ed in questo panorama deprimente vedo tante persone, a tutti i livelli, che nonostante tutto cercano di dare alla vita pubblica e privata il senso dell'impegno onesto, con tanta fatica e contro ogni pronostico.

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"Love of your country is a healthy phenomenon, that is when ""the country"" is in fact an amalgamation of its people's accomplishments, inventions, positive behavioral characteristics and culture.  

Many however are nationalists in the sense that they love the country as if it were an entity in itself, a team, a 'side', which is not only admired but seen as potentially superior to other countries.  In doing so, other nations are automatically relegated to a lower rank by the nationalist.  It is by definition the case that one country would then be seen as exceptional in comparison.  Suddenly there exists a problem.

This perceived difference in merit, ranking, righteousness (you name it), is why nationalism so frequently grows in unhealthy ways.  It is a springboard from which populist political movements can easily take off from.  The 20th century was an experiment in taking nationalism to its natural conclusions; among others ethnocentrism and ""purity"",

&gt;Some nationalists exclude certain groups. Some nationalists, defining the national community in ethnic, linguistic, cultural, historic, or religious terms (or a combination of these), may then seek to deem certain minorities as not truly being a part of the 'national community' as they define it. 

Territorial nationalism and ultra-nationalism were also quickly embraced.  It was nationalist sentiment which allowed for ethnocentric policies in the early to mid 20th century to enable pogroms, deportations, executions, harassment, genocide, discrimination, territorial expansion, mass rape, and indiscriminate murder of various national or ethnic groups.  It took about a hundred years from writers eliciting a romantic portrayel of their homeland to the systematic removal of entire socio-ethnic groups.

In the 21st century nationalism is used as a political tool to campaign for increased crackdowns on illegal immigrants (scapegoating is a hallmark of the ideology), increased police power, a growth of centralized authority, and violent conflict.  Used as a rallying banner, it is as meaningless as football team rivalries are.

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_distribution_of_wealth) is a statistic about distribution of wealth. If you sort by Gini coefficient, it should give you a good idea about the equality of wealth in these countries.

Spain (which was mentioned in the article) seems to have the most equal distribution in Europe. Italy is almost as good as Spain. So this seems to confirm your hypothesis.

But Germany has a much more equal distribution than France. So I don't know.

Another reason for low amount of house ownership in Germany could be the fact that there are relatively few young adults in Germany that live with their parents. Those are of course renting. But maybe this was considered in the statistic. Also the numbers are actually not that different between Germany and Spain for young adults living with their parents (see [this PDF](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-10-050/EN/KS-SF-10-050-EN.PDF)).

Also lots of the commenters really sound like shills lol, that's the first article I've found such people on the pro memorandum side.

The mistake you are making is that some people have more freedom of expression than others because they own the media. So, if you naively just sum up the number of accusations you listen for each group, you end up with a skewed impression about who is more at fault. 

&gt; I already gave an example of how the greek state is easily exploited, usually with a nationalist/""proletarian"" excuse, by both the rich and corrupt and the low to middle class ""armies of voters"" after the easy job with the high salary. And also how them not being severed by at least 10% and starting with the most corrupt, isn't egalitarian in any way. And it also leaves too many doors open. They should at least give up on the ""public sector employees can't get fired"" right, what the hell?

This whole paragraph is a rant. What point are you trying to make here? I guess I agree that the provision to never fire public employees is a  problem, although you do have to consider its historical context. In the past, governments could just fire everyone that belonged to a different party. This is the reason why the provision was included in the first place. 

&gt; Greece needs to think in terms of activity/production/innovation instead of fighting the EU for a bigger budget. If all those efforts are met with ""we'll work for Bulgarian salaries"", or if say it's tied to the universities or sth, then the people hiring their cousins to do phd's and steal the educational subsidies going on about how ""the markets will poison the freedom of research"", and at the same time the status quo of the public sector and the parfyades of it is untouchable, then we are going anywhere. Also army men / police / beaurocrats / teachers / priests / afisokolites / apofoitoi iek syndikaliston deko, are starting to get undesirable.

true,datenwolf,null,null,"&gt; Wouldn''t large scale coverage with solar panels lead to cooling of local temperature?

That depends. Say you built the modules in an area that formerly had a very high albedo – I'm thinking about something with similar albedo as the White Sands National Monument – you'd actually increase the local temperatures.

It boils down to this: The ideal solar cell has an albedo of 0, i.e. it absorbs all incoming radiation. At an efficiency θ this would mean that the locally dissipated heat would be 1 - θ. But if we look at natural surfaces their albedo is just their efficiency at not absorbing radiation. So for an ideal solar cell of efficiency θ it's thermal effects are equivalent to a natural surface with an albedo of θ.

Now according to Wikipedia green grass has an albedo of 0.25 = 25%). Hence if we assume a ideal solar cell with an efficiency θ = 0.25 = 25% its thermal effects are almost identical to that of green grass. Now add a sprinkler system to wash off the dust of the cells and the water vaporization would cancel out as well (most of the heat absorbed by vegetation is used for water vaporization).",0,1366467508,null,0,false,0,c9j2hiy,t3_1cnmul,t1_c9j2hiy,t1_c9j211h,null,1431490687,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Why would you release them as soon as your appointed party leader, only to have the opposition party steal your ideas? That's why parties usually wait until very close the election and reveal all their carefully planned policies and campaigns all at once. 

Additionally Ed Miliband is in a very difficult situation because he has to deal with being in New Labour, ie Post Blair Labour. So he has to make a lot of difficult decisions about where the party is going and what it stands for. 

I don't really blame him for waiting to reveal all his policies. He's not simply playing the ""Oh we hate what they're doing card"" He's simply doing what all opposition parties do when they have a new leader, they wait until close to the election to reveal their policies. I have no doubt that come the election Labour will have a very full manifesto to choose from. I'll stave off being highly critical of them until that point.

The people next door in my lab are researching the physics of photosynthesis so I pass by their posters every day. It's been long known that photosynthesis is a horribly inefficient process. Net efficiency something between 1% to 3%. You can easily estimate this by looking at the energy density of plants, their growth rates and the amount of light energy they absorb. Well, its often proposed to bioengineer algae that produce large quantities of oils and run those in suspension through biosolar collectors to produce fuel. Well, at only 2% mean efficiency this would mean a very low yield.

Modern solar cells have some 25% and if you used concentrated solar power (CSP) you can collect at even 60% efficiency. Electrical methanol synthesis from CO2 and water has an efficiency of about 40% (IIRC). Well I went Googling for numbers on the efficiency of methanol synthesis and found a paper delivering even the answer to my following question: What yield would a CSP-&gt;methanol fuel manufacturing plant have?

Merkel was honest. You shouldn't brush it off as ""yeah, we all meddle with statistics"".

I accept that there is a big difference in productivity, but not what you say above.

The data for Greece come from OECD's National Accounts questionnaire replies, which is the same method in the case of Austria and other countries. The data for Germany come from IAB, an institute of the Federal Employment Agency.

That would be a perpetual motion machine of the 1st kind. Doesn't violate the laws of physics, but is impossible to build. But okay, I'll go of it.

That energy collected will be put to work eventually. Eventually that energy will be released and turn into heat eventually. So the global net heat balance remains unchanged. So yes, such a kind of solar cell would cause a local cool down effect. *But* somewhere the heat of the radiation would be released.

Now imagine you place the solar cells in proximity to where the energy is processed, i.e. rooftops in the cities and such. By putting the collected energy into work locally, the local effects of cool down and heat release exactly cancel out.

Even a Solar cell of 100% efficiency will heat up if less power is drawn from it as it could collect.

true,myekename,ESPA,Spain,"I've taught and lived in both Spain and the US....and have traveled quite a bit through both.  From my experience, the ""Americans are lazy, stupid and uninterested"" stereotype is really overplayed and inaccurate.  We as Americans definitely have our faults, but I guess from an education perspective I really don't see it.

Are there people living in the US that don't have a clue as to what's going on in the world?  Yeah, of course.  You'll find them in every country. 

I think part of the reasoning behind this sense that Americans don't care about anything but American is partly related to just how much news Americans need to absorb.  You have to consider how large the United States is.  There are states that are larger than European countries ([just look at Texas alone](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hIB-M-_-3FA/T96N0IzFhfI/AAAAAAAAsDY/E05xW4AI6Og/s640/TEXAS+EUROPE+SIZE+COMPARISON+MAP.jpg)).  To be able to stay up with the news of your own country (which naturally most people regardless of background are going to be most interested in) is a time consuming affair when your country is larger than all of Europe.  A lot of energy is invested in US news for us....because there is A LOT of US news to stay up on.  

But that aside, I still find that Americans....and **especially** younger Americans take quite a bit of interest in the world they live in.  A really interesting comparison between the two countries came up between my own education and while teaching abroad in Spain.

When I was in high school, we were assigned a semester long project in which we were to pick a country that we were interested in (other than our own) and do a research project on it.  While a few people opted to talk about the romantic Italian countryside or the food in France....the vast majority of the class picked very abstract countries.  I did mine on Cambodia.  Others picked small countries on the west coast of Africa.  A few went for the middle east.

Jump forward a few years, and I decide to assign this same project while teaching in Spain.  About 40% of the class picks the US.  About 25% pick countries that speak Spanish.  25% pick a country in Europe.

I know this is very anecdotal ""evidence"", but that's all I have.  I'm just sharing my own experience, and you can draw whatever conclusions you want.  From my own experience, Americans want to know about the world around them just as much as any European does.  We have a lot of material to get through in order to master our own history/news...and maybe that puts us a little behind.  Regardless, I can tell you that the zest for knowledge and understanding about the world we live in is not lacking in the United States.  It's very much alive.",1,1366474908,null,0,false,0,c9j4g96,t3_1cqky1,t1_c9j4g96,t1_c9j3x11,null,1431489762,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

true,Andaru,ITAL,Italy,"Quick summary: the parliament is divided in 3 blocks of similar size (PD - left, PDL - Berlusconi's right, M5S - Grillo's protest party), plus some stragglers. The PD has a forced majority in one house, but so far any attempts at forming a government have failed.

In the meantime the time has come to elect a new President of the Republic, which happens every 7 years. This preempts any new elections, as only a president with over 6 months of office left can dissolve the parliament and call new elections. 

Not only the 3 blocks failed to agree on a president, but the PD itself couldn't find an internal agreement until a 'surefire' proposal was put forward and agreed upon - Prodi. Only that it failed due to 'traitors' that secretly voted another candidate. This basically caused the PD to self-destruct. As a last resort before exploding they asked the incumbent president Napolitano (88 years old) to step forward for another round. He accepted and was voted in.

Now: the PD will probably split and/or go through major pains. The PDL is flying in the polls as the only remaining party (?) with any cohesion. The M5S, remote controlled by Grillo, is now starting a rabid protest claiming this is a coup because they were utterly ignored.

Whatever government will be cobbled together will likely not last long, and Napolitano will probably resign as soon as possible after a new electoral law is voted for. All in all it's a major mess, also because the PD, for all its flaws, was the only internally democratic party.

We skipped over the world wars because they were covered in American history.  I remember studying world war I and II and we definitely learned about the events leading up to it.

Um mich da ein bißchen auszuheulen ziehe ich mal das Beispiel Fahrzeuge ran. Meiner Meinung nach hat ein großer Teil dieser Gruppe einen furchtbaren Geschmack und legt keinen Wert auf Details, stört sich dafür auch nicht an offensichtlichen Augenbeleidigungen.

 Wenn ich eine Reihe geparkter Motorräder sehe, weiß ich sofort welches einen meist spät eingestiegen Babyboomer-Besitzer hat. Es sind die, auf denen ein furchtbar großes Topcase montiert ist. [Sowas](http://www.tempo-zweirad.de/assets/images/CB1100-Topcase.jpg). Es scheint ein regelrechter Wettbewerb zu bestehen wer sich das größte hässlichste Ding auf seine neue (man hat ja Kohle) Maschine klatscht. Klar ist das praktisch, wenn man aber schon einen Haufen Asche z.B. Für ein Retrobike wegen der Optik ausgibt, braucht man das doch nicht gleich wieder verschandeln.

 Oder diese furchtbaren SUVs. ""Da sitzt man so schön hoch, und Platz hat man auch drin."" Höre ich oft von Bewunderern dieser Autogattung aus der hier angesprochenen Genaration. Wenn man einen fetten Arsch und einen kaputten Rücken hat ist das natürlich die Wahl Nummer eins. Ein Bus würde das auch tun, hätte noch mehr Platz, aber da wird man ja gleich vom Nachbarn als armer Schlucker abgestempelt. Und dann das hier: [Der X6](http://www.ubergrun.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/bmw-x6-hybrid.jpg)  soll ja an [den hier](http://sportscarforums.com/attachments/1052d1118979001-1984bmwe24m6635csi.jpg.w560h250.jpg) errinnern. Was zur Hölle haben an einem Auto, das an ein Coupe erinnern soll diese beschissenen hinteren Türen verloren? Macht euch nichts vor, ihr braucht die eh nicht, eure Enkel kommen euch nicht besuchen. Diese Türen sehen aus, wie ein verkümmertes Kleeblatt. Und wo wir schon beim Thema sind,  ein echtes Coupe hat einen [Luxusvorteil](http://www.e211.de/Geschichte/Ahnentafel_E-Klasse/BR124_-_Foto_Coupe_Mopf0_2.jpg). Wer sieht es? Richtig, die schönen langen Türen und damit auch große Fenster, aus denen man sehr chillig seinen Ellbogen lehnen kann (wenn einen die Zugluft nicht stört). Speziell dieser Hersteller hat bis zu diesem Modell sogar die B Säule weggelassen, noch geiler, man hat die komplette Seite offen. Für sowas wäre ich bereit Kohle hinzulegen wenn ich protzen will, und eben nicht für "" da sitz man so schön hoch"". 

Und was blubbert unter der Haube? 6 Zylinder befeuert mit wohlriechendem Superbenzin, und eben kein verschissener TDi, der ja ach so toll abzieht und dabei auch noch so super sparsam ist. Wer Autos in dieser Preisklasse fährt, wird sich den Brennstoff ja wohl gerade noch so leisten können, zudem dem ehrlichen Rechner auffällt, das der Treibstoff einen gerade zu lächerlichen Teil der Kosten des Autofahrens ausmacht, im Verhältniss dazu, was für ein Geschiss gemacht wird, wenn es mal wieder teuerer wird (wovor ich seit dem Kindergarten gewarnt wurde, mich wundert es nicht). Wenn schon protzen, dann richtig. Hubraum, ausreichend Zylinder im Ottomotor und dann kann ich mir den Selbstzünder im Rückspiegel betrachten, und sauberer Verbrennen tuts auch, während ich mir die Ellbogen auf meinen langen Coupetüren sonne.

Und zu guter letzt komme ich nochmal auf die Motorräder zurück. Man kann einen Motorradladen nicht mehr an einem sonnigen Tag betreten, ohne dass die Babyboomer überall rumlungern und das Personal ewig an sich binden. Sie müssen ja schließlich das Funkgerät auch erstmal auf dem Parklplatz ausprobieren, dass sie ja später auch ihre fette Alte auf dem Soziusitz zuschmarren könne. ""Roswitha, Roswitha, kannst du mich hören?"" (hab ich wirklich auf einem Parkplatz von einem Motorradladen gehört). Da will man sich eben mal schnell einen Ersatz für den gerissenen Kupplungszug holen, da muss man in seiner alten, ölbefleckten, abgwetzten Lederkluft  ewig warten bis ihn jemand aus dem Lager holen kann, weil in der riesigen Bekleidungsabteilung die Babyboomer von der Belegschaft wissen wollen, ob ihr fetter Arsch in die 500€ Lederhose passt.

 Wenn die Alte übrigens selbst dann noch den Moppedschein macht, fährt die bei einer Tour in das lokale dumm-durch-die Gegend-fahr-Gehege zu 99% ihrem Macker hinterher. Das ist auch gut so, denn die meisten die ich sehe hocken dermaßen verkrampft auf ihren Topcase verzierten Böcken, dass mir Angst und Bange wird wenn ich die sehe. Das ist kein Alleinstellungsmerkmal der weiblichen Späteinsteiger, es sticht mir nur immer wieder ins Auge. Oft hat der Gatte halt doch mal was motorisertes Zweirädriges in Jungen Jahren, und hat somit einen Vorteil. 

Ich unterstelle dieser Generation nicht, dass sie faul waren. Die haben hart für diesen Wohlstand gearbeitet, und haben ihn meiner Meinung nach auch verdient. Ich finde aber, dass sie ruhig was davon abgeben könnten, und eben nicht auf dem großen Teil des Geldes, der Immobilien, der politischen Macht, der Schlüsselpositionen in Firmen, Parteien und Gewerkschaften und den Motorräder hocken bleiben sollen. In meinem Freundeskreis fahren hautptsächlich die Ingenieure, die Juristen und die Lehrer Motorrad, der Rest kann sich das nicht leisten.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"I think Taenk is actually raising a good point, though I don't think the Switzerland example is helping. 

The point being ""should Europe really be trying to intervene with other people's affairs?"" Personally I think we should be as militarily isolationist as possible and try and do everything through diplomacy and economics, with the army only existing if we, ourselves, are attacked first. Under NATO the West has developed a policy of active military participation in foreign conflicts (Iraq, Libya, Mali, and to a lesser extent the Balkans and Cold War theatres). A lot of people, like myself, I displeased with such a strategy and believe the rest of the World is the rest of the World's business and that they should sort out their own problems. 

You raised the issue about  ""interests and responsiblities"" are normally the counter arguments to my point of view, but I really don't think that it's our job to make the rest of the world a better place and I certainly don't think a good way of doing that is through military might, not even when they're committing atrocities. And as for our ""interests"" well, is it right to use an army which kills people to protect our ""interests"". 

The EU (but not so much its member states) has adopted a foreign policy of diplomacy rather than military intervention. I'm proud of that and hope it continues. ",0,1366484584,null,0,false,0,c9j7bhz,t3_1cqkyc,t1_c9j7bhz,t1_c9j6xse,null,1431488208,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The surviving suspect hasn't been even indicted yet and already people are treating this as an open-and-shut case. I don't think they're celebrating revenge at this point but more about the relief that they were caught so quickly. After all these two guys turned Boston upside down for a couple days with their (it's rather likely) terror attack. 

The scary thing about American justice system is that it has changed a lot in the past 40 years and for the past 25 years it most certainly hasn't been about reintegration, if it ever was. This whole ""tough on crime"" stance started forming out in the 70's and 80's and the jail sentences started getting very long even for relatively minor crimes. These days no politician dares to stray from the ""tough on crime"" narrative and that's why you end up with people serving for years for minor weed related offences and some states going the extra mile with their three strikes laws. 

The people in the US by and large don't see criminals as victims of their circumstances and who need support, reintegration and penance after a   fashion. They want bad people locked up for good and preferably in austere conditions so they're properly punished. I've met many Americans who think that prison rape is a part of the deal. ""If you can't do the time don't do the crime."" In many US states prisoners cannot vote during their sentences and in quite a few you lose your voting rights for multiple years or for good after you get out. Rehabilitation of inmates? Not likely to happen.

I feel that this attitude originally stems from frontier life (and romanticism) and this conservative rhetoric about good vs bad that has been filling up the US public debate for the past 40-60 years.",0,1366486798,null,0,false,0,c9j7ylb,t3_1cr56l,t1_c9j7ylb,t1_c9j76iy,null,1431487905,57,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,57

What irritates me is not that Europeans are less aware of American geography than I am, but of the hypocritical attitude they adopt about the average American's geographical knowledge while the average European's geographical knowledge is frankly not substantially better (and where it is better, it's because of an unequal flow of cultural material from America to Europe and not the other way).",0,1366489102,null,0,false,0,c9j8lc8,t3_1con2p,t1_c9j8lc8,t1_c9j8df3,null,1431487608,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

Königswinter itself hasn’t much to offer to a young person IMO, but Bonn is only 10 minutes away by train and has anything from bars and clubs to cafes and cinemas. The university is right downtown (at least parts of it) so there are lots of young people. Since you’ll be there next week, you should check out [“Rhein in Flammen”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhein_in_Flammen) on the Mai 4th. There is kind of a festival in the “Rheinaue” Park with music and beer. Probably a good place to meet people (it’s free).

As for the daytrips: that depends on your interests. If you are into cathedrals or other historic stuff: Cologne is not far away and is a good start. If you want to see some castles you should head in the other direction for example in the Moseltal. Bonn used to be the German capital until 1990, so if you’re politically interested there are some things, too. What do you want to see? 

Depending on your work schedule and need for adventure you could even check out other bigger cities in Germany (Berlin or Munich are about 1h by plane) or the rest of Europe (Paris ~1h, Barcelona ~2h). The airport Cologne/ Bonn is really close by and there are lots of cheap flights available from there.

No matter what you decide to do, I hope you have fun and a great experience!

Countries are not religious constructs, they are not cultural constructs, they are not linguistic constructs: religion, culture and language can be handled at the regional level.

true,bunburya,IREL,Hibernia,"&gt; At present the democratic deficit in Europe is massive. If we're going to integrate further then we need to see how this is going to be resolved.

I doubt we will agree on just how serious a problem the democratic deficit is, I bet you think it's much larger than I do, but I agree that there are ways in which the EU could be made more democratic and I support that process.  I don't think wanting the European Parliament to have the power to initiate legislation, for example, is at all inconsistent with wanting a federal Europe.

&gt; The EU is driven by fluffy political grandstanding and very little in the way of detailed implementation. This needs to change

This is nonsense, many EU laws, regulations and Commission publications are extremely detailed.

&gt; The EU is corrupt as hell. Many Northern countries should not be looking to move to a more corrupt form of government than the one they have. It's insane.

I don't really see how the EU is any more corrupt than most national governments.  It's a claim I always see made but never substantiated.

&gt; For a lot of people to stomach the fiscal transfers needed to sort out the problems in the ""South"" is a bit much and as a result they'd probably want the South to cede more control over spending. 

Again, I don't see how this is contrary to federalism.  Wealth transfers from rich to poor regions combined with increased pooling of sovereignty sounds like a pretty solid path to federalism to me.

&gt; The EU is far too inward looking and worrying over idiotic things such as CAP which should be left to nation states. Where we could benefit from a federal government e.g. defence it whimps out to keep the pacafist/neutral countries happy. 

This kind of begs the question.  Why is CAP something that would be better left to nation states?  It seems to me that if you have a common market, and you want to have any sort of agricultural policy at all, it is necessary to have a common agricultural policy.

&gt; The EZ crisis highlights just how immature the processes and functions of the EU are and how much still goes on behind closed doors. If it wants to be a government it needs to stop behaving like a spoilt child (e.g. the 6 monthly migration) 

What the EZ crisis highlights is the danger of doing integration half-assedly.  If you want a common currency you need common rules which affect that currency.  I also don't see how a 6 month rotating presidency equates to acting like a ""spoilt child"", nor how it significantly impedes the running of the EU (not that I particularly support the six month rotation, either).",0,1366495349,null,0,false,0,c9jab4h,t3_1co7dd,t1_c9jab4h,t1_c9ifooc,null,1431486799,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,zedvaint,null,null,"&gt;Germany is smaller and not considered to be a leader in military or security matters by the general populace. Expectations of American forces by Americans are much higher than of German forces.

I don't expect anything of a populace that doesn't even understand the difference between the Czech Republic and Chechnya. I also don't really understand why an incident that happened over 40 years ago is in any way relevant. The GSG9 was formed as a reaction to Munich, the first public mission they did was Mogadishu and they handled that rather excellent. They stand up to any counter terrorism unit anywhere. The fact that the US populace doesn't know that has more to do with Hollywood than anything else. 

&gt;The shame of Germany inviting a foreign team  to deal with a terrorist problem would have paled in comparison to the actual shame they now deal with because they screwed up the operation.

Again: hindsight. And again: Waco, Texas. In comparison to Munich this situation was very different, there was a stand-off that lasted over a month. US forces could have brought any unit up there, including Santa Claus and his elves. They did nothing and screwed up royally. 76 people, men, women and children burned up while the cops didn't even have a fire truck ready.

Every time there is a story in the Nordic Countries about some guy being arrested for sending money to terrorist cells or for having planned/done something godawful (for religious reasons or otherwise), the dialogue is mostly about how we as a society have failed them as individuals. 

You can't really celebrate failure, can you? Even if you aren't interested in the motives of the killer (how we as an environment urged him toward this course of action), you can perhaps think of the failure of the security guards or the grief of the families. 

There is nothing to celebrate. Only to mourn.

In the case of Boston, I read that one of the suspects publicly said several times that he didn't connect with his environment, didn't feel American. That's awful! It means a total failure of the system to integrate immigrants (or population), to make them welcome, to make them belong. That this particular person resorted into terrorism is unfortunate, but Boston probably has hundreds of people who feel the same and who AREN'T investing in pressure cookers.

Or perhaps should investigate why nobody started to have chats with him when he started talking about terrorism being the right course of action in certain situations.

In case someone doesn't see the ""police"" sign on the back, it would be beneficial being able to identify them as police, not military.

&gt;2. The American ones all had ""Police"" on them in multiple locations, frequently on the back in big letters just like you're talking about.

I might have missed those labels on some images, possibly due to perspective. Also black on camouflage pattern isn't as easily readable as white on black.

&gt;I really don't see how going from assault rifle to machine pistol is a big improvement.

The bullet has a lower energy and therefore a lower potential to do unintended damage.

&gt;GSG9 (the only German police SWAT unit that actually has its weapons listed publicly, that I could find anyway) does use assault rifles, the G36 specifically.

The GSG9 is a special case (they're a federal unit, specifically intended for high risk counter-terrorism/hostage operations), the regular SEKs  are a part of the state's police force and use the weapons the police of that state uses.

&gt;I just google image searched ""german swat""

A lot of the results aren't German, at least what google gives me in my filter bubble.

&gt;I also tried ""polizei sek"" and got roughly the same result

My filter bubble might be a little different than yours, I got a few assault rifles, too, but the most common ""heavy"" (heavier than a pistol) weapon appears to be the MP5. (which looks like a small assault rifle) This fits with the images in the media when they report on a police operation involving an SEK. They rarely use anything heavier than the machine pistol. Possibly most SEKs have bigger guns, but they don't regularly use them, especially not in an urban setting. (at least not where they're seen with them)

Where do you think the Euro comes from exactly, how do you believe it enters circulation? Because to me it seems debt is **essential** long-term. It underpins the whole monetary system.

Now once you've considered money for a bit, perhaps you can ponder the question: is it possible that this system is non-optimal? That perhaps, like the UK/USA/Japan/Singapore etc it may be beneficial to have an entity in the EMU that is capable of spending *without* the market questioning its ability to pay that spending back at a later date?

Per la verità è stato aver provato a fare questo fino all'ultimo che ha rovinato Bersani. 

Per fottere seriamente Berlusconi dovevi avere l'accordo blindato coi cinque stelle prima ancora di partire. Ci facevi il governo, ti mettevi d'accordo sul presidente della Repubblica e fra Camera e Senato si andava lisci come nemmeno il 2008. Se però questo accordo non ce l'hai, e decidi di partire come se ce l'avessi e di costruirtelo per strada tra un vaffanculo a Berlusconi e l'altro sei due volte miope: 1) perché poi arrivi alla fine che l'accordo non c'è; 2) perché a quel punto ti tocca andare col piattino da Berlusconi che non vede l'ora di prenderti un po' per il culo. Risultato: muori te, muore il partito e la sola persona che trae vantaggio dal fatto che per la prima e unica volta nella storia dell'umanità un comunista viene rieletto a furor di popolo presidente della Repubblica si chiama Silvio stracazzo Berlusconi. E questo stracciaculo di Bersani si era permesso di fare il figo e dire a uno come Casini (che alle elezioni ha fatto persino più schifo di lui, ma che oggi è dieci volte più vivo) che ""di tattica si può morire"". Pippa.

Attenzione: con questo non voglio dire che fosse giusto finire lingua in bocca con Berlusconi. Al contrario: se di mestiere fai il capo della sinistra ammazzarlo deve essere la tua ragione di vita.

true,slapchopsuey,UNSA,United States of America,"It's weird from the inside too, at least to some of us. Reminds me of the month following Sept. 11 2001. Now, like then, there's a sort of pack mentality that seems to spring to life out of nowhere, driven by the worst impulses. Fear, bloodlust, paranoia. No idea why, but I seemed to be immune to it. Maybe it was because I had a few arab and pakistani friends? I don't know. 

It's a very isolating and unnerving feeling, being literally surrounded by people scared out of their minds and calling for blood, people frightened by random objects, who seem to have lost all sense of perspective and sense of self. Blink and it's like peoples' mindsets went back to another century, only with a modern skin. I always figured this was just something in human nature, that a switch is flipped that triggers something like a defensive herd mentality, so it's interesting to read here that it doesn't seem to occur in Europe. 

Thinking back to my experiences in Septmber of 2001 and looking at the footage from Boston now, it appears that this is a 'white people' phenomenon, in that the crowds of people taken in by this mentality are more white than the population around them. 

It's also something that people who aren't really aware of what's going on in the world seem to fall into, like the shock of their personal life bubble being forcefully burst. 

Another possible variable is religiosity; I'm not religious at all, and in 2001 the handful of friends/acquaintances around me who didn't fall into the mob mentality were all also not religious. Given the odds of that, and that Europe is not religious, I suspect having a critical mass of religious people attacked by people of a different religion might set something off.

While it's generally accepted as a conservative/liberal paper, it has a penchant for populism, so it's not entirely surprising to find an article like that there.

Now Germany has a bunch of right-wingers that have repeatedly tried to establish themselves in the mainstream in recent years. They've founded parties like [Pro Deutschland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Germany_Citizens'_Movement) and [Die Freiheit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Freedom_Party), both of which were debunked pretty fast, and they've tried to hijack others, like the Pirates in their early days. AfD seems to be their most recent attempt.

For 33 years Pacman has been eating himself through his maze, being pursued by ghosts and fed with power pills. And then comes Mike Berkin and tells this story of eating and being eaten on YouTube, in his very own way. From New York City, Susanne Lingemann is reporting.

Miss Pacman is eating herself through a New York City office. A video game, posted to the wall with post-it notes. More than 5,700 images, photographed one at a time, then animated.

Mike Berkin worked for more than 11 months on this, everytime his colleagues called it a day, and took down the images before they came back to work.

""I like working alone and in silence. I just happen to be a very private person and have no social life at all. I don't even own a cell phone, there's nobody I can talk to or whom I have to meet.""

'Code guy' is working as a software developer at his company. A super nerd, who never missed a day at work in 12 years and who doesn't even take time off for vacation. So the 34 year-old doesn't even really know NYC because all he does is going from his apartment to work at the historical Woolworth building. His boss ari, himself a game enthusiast, didn't have any clue that the office turned into a movie set during weekends.

""Mike is a genius, a true eccentric and also a fantastic software developer.""

Many bloggers on YouTube raise doubts that Mark did indeed animate his Jumpman from thousands of images. The reason for this: The outer part of the images seems very static, and also the lightning is the same in every image.

""Every single picture of the animation is a digital composition. This means, every configuration of post-its was physically attached to the wall in this office and has been photographed individually. I then cut them out and put them into a photframe.""

From now on, Mike will use his post-its just for their original purpose. Supernerd's newest project: A sphere, 12 ft in diameter, made of pencils. More on this to come on YouTube.

Seit 33 Jahren frisst sich Pacman nun schon so durch sein Labyrinth, verfolgt von Gespenstern und gefüttert mit Kraftpillen. Und dann kommt Mike Berkin und erzählt auf YouTube diese Geschichte von Fressen und Gefressenwerden auf seine Art. Aus New York dazu Susanne Lingemann.

Miss Pacman frisst sich durch ein New Yorker Büro. Ein Videogame mit Post-It-Zetteln an die Wand geklebt. Über 5700 Bilder, einzeln fotografiert, dann animiert. 

Über 11 Monate hat Mike Berkin daran getüftelt, immer dann, wenn alle Kollegen Feierabend hatten, und die Bilder wieder abgenommen, bevor die Kollegen zurückkamen. 

""Ich mag es, allein und im Stillen zu arbeiten. Ich bin eben ein sehr privater Mensch, hab absolut kein Sozialleben. Ich hab nicht mal ein Handy, ich hab eben niemanden, mit dem ich sprechen kann oder den ich treffen muss.""

'Code guy' ist Softwareentwickler seiner Firma. Ein Supernerd, der in den 12 Jahren nicht einen Tag gefehlt hat, nie krank war und sogar auf seinen Urlaub verzichtet. So kennt der 34-jährige New York eigentlich gar nicht, denn er geht immer nur von seiner Wohnung zur Arbeit im historischen Woolworth-Gebäude. Sein Boss Ari, selbst fanatischer Gamer, hatte keine Ahnung, dass das Büro am Wochenende zum Filmstudio wurde.

""Mike ist ein Genie, ein richtiger Exzentriker und auch ein wirklich fantastischer Softwareentwickler.""

Viele Blogger auf YouTube bezweifeln, dass Mark tatsächlich sein Jumpman mit tausenden von Fotos animiert hat. Grund: Der Rahmen der Bilder sei einfach zu statisch, und auch das Licht immer gleich.

""Jedes einzelne Bild der Animation ist eine digitale Komposition. Das heißt, jede Konfiguration der Post-It-Zettel war wirklich hier im Büro an der Wand und wurde einzeln fotografiert. Das habe ich dann in ein Foto gestanzt.""

As less and less people get married and you guys also plan to do get married in France, one of Europe's most 'non religious' countries, there would be nothing weird about not doing a second marriage in a church. This applies even more if you guys aren't actually religious. 

Don't forget something: you're not getting married for other people. You're getting married because you love each other (hey, at least I hope so). If you're worried about getting accepted in his family, don't forget that you want them to accept you as who you really are and not as who you aren't. If you doubt that some wouldn't accept you because of this, they're maybe not worth that you put too much effort into this either. It's one thing to do a favor to a religious partner, but it's a whole different story to do this because of each other's family. 

Either way, I wish you guys a happy marriage!

You don't need an army of them. Only one's enough and she can be whoever you want. In French marriages, they're only called ""witnesses"" and don't have a major role apart signing a paper at the city hall as she was there at your wedding and that you indeed got married. It can even be a man.

This is the real flaw with the EMU model - there's not one entity that can run continual deficits providing the rest of the economy with savings.

It's a debt based monetary system that depends on everyone always being content with a low level of savings, as for people to be holding savings you need *someone* to be holding the corresponding debt, but in the EMU there's no one that can do it. When a united savings drive takes place across the EMU due to global financial crisis, the whole system grinds to a halt - households try to save, putting governments into debt, the market questions whether those governments can sustain those debts and the whole system collapses. Those governments then impose austerity measures trying to stop households from saving, often the households win out and the deficits continue anyway but it doesn't matter the damage is done, expectations have been destroyed furthering people's intent to save. Paradox of thrift sets in and everyone's out of the job as a result.

It's a real mess. Yet if the market never questioned government's abilities to pay back their debt, ie if the ECB unconditionally backed all government debt, bond yields would never rise and these savings could have been easily provided by the government. This is the luxury that Japan gets with the BoJ, the UK with the BoE, the USA with the Fed, Singapore with the MAS, etc. It is safe to say that these nations would sooner print than default, and accordingly their ability to pay their debt is never questioned by bond markets - they all have the lowest interest lending attainable in their respective currencies, an interest rate set by the central bank itself. The only problem with this is the huge moral hazard it'd present when you have a monetary union without a fiscal union.. which is why the Euro, in its current form, was a mistake. Its design has real flaws and that these aren't being addressed is most concerning.. there really isn't any efficient way out without major changes, and even the slow way out does nothing to ensure a similar crisis won't happen again.",0,1366523725,null,0,false,0,c9ji1ag,t3_1cqfe0,t1_c9ji1ag,t1_c9jftn4,null,1431483086,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Relative to its small size, the metro area of Boston is massively culturally influential in the U.S. of A., arguably equal to New York or L.A., because of its age and the pattern of settlement which moved from east to west. This influence continues today because of the top area schools and technology hubs, as well as being a bastion of the revolution and liberal politics. For example, the Kennedys are Bostonian.

Addressing those 7 threads (actually, there were even more) new threads kept being made because the activity in the thread was so high it would cause the thread to go read-only in less than an hour, so new ones had to be made to continue the police scanner translation and news debriefing. Remember that reddit was also suffering a [malicious bot attack at the same time](https://plus.google.com/+Mashable/posts/4tACYwCrv56), and so was particularly laggy. 

I have two additional theories, not sure how to back them up. I suspect that reddit is disproportionately represented in the Boston area and/or among those who once called Boston home. Large areas of the city were in lock-down, which means that a lot of redditors were trapped at work, but could not work, or where trapped at home, and anxious for news, not just for news sake, but to be assured of the safety of loved ones and themselves.  Those reddit threads had much cleaner and faster news than any T.V. or radio. 

A controversial side note that has been large in my mind since Monday, is that the city of Boston is likely to have done more to fund terrorism then any city in the U.S. [The support for the Irish resistance was public and monied](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ira/reports/america.html), at least 1960's - 1980's. I knew of ""retired"" Irish freedom fighters who came to Boston much as retired N.Y. mafia would go to West Haven CT. 

I cannot find a reference on the web right now, but I remember seeing the Sinn Fein billboards, and my father being angry about them, when I was a child in the area. There has been rapid recent gentrification, but I remember being nervous of my very British name while walking the shamrock studded streets of [Southie.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Boston)

I'll admit that this side note is irreverent to the current tragedy, but I also think karma is a bitch who does not always protect the innocent.

As others says, in France, religious marriage have no purpose, it's not ""converted"" as a civil marriage certificate. If you're both atheist or agnostics, it might be better to skipped the religious steps, as for catholic marriage, you should attempt class prior to the wedding (about 4 to 5 cours), as well as attempt metting with the preist. It might sound easy to go through, but it's time consuming and pretty full of bigotry.

For administrativ purpose anyway, your fiancee will have to get a kind of ""bachelor certificate"" meaning his authorised to get married to you, it was pretty humiliating for me as I felt that french administration granted me the right to get married, by getting questioned and to proof that I known the family of my futur-wife.

Wedding tradition in france can be difficult somehow. It depend how you both see your wedding happend: venue, outfit, attendees. Traditional wedding venues as display in french media are actually not the most common way people getting married. I mostly attempt friends' wedding at the cityhall, with mayor (or deputy), and the venue is a dinner / outdoor-BBQ at home with close friends &amp; family only, about 20-30 peoples. I'm sure there are huge wedding venue with fancy dress and all, but it's costly and pretty boring for the groom/bride (uncomfortable outfit, lot of smille to unknown peoples...). You rather manage to invite (pay the flight ticket) for your sister/mother (as you seems to care for them), rather than creating a big wedding venue for the big family of your futur-husband (peoples you don't know, and mostly, you might meet them 2 or 3 times in your all life)

To answer fully your question, we (wife&amp;I) eloped for our wedding, as it was way to difficult to manage family/friends/costs/time/motivation to plan a full venue. Family &amp; friends were informed afterward (about 2-3 months after). Out of one or two of them who thought they are so important that they have right to sound there opinion about it, all friends/family are happy for us (you might want to get rid of those pretentious vocal people, but I recommend you do not).
For us may be, within the next 4-5 years, we'll make a 'redo', 'cause it's out of social pressure, it's fun, it can be a good occasion to have an outdoor-BBQ-party at home, and we'll be able at that time to gather the important 7 friends (from 7 different countries) &amp; 3 family members (from 2 different country) we want to invites.

&gt; Studierende
&gt; Wenn Studierende familienversichert sind, brauchen sie keine eigenen Beiträge zu zahlen. Sind sie nicht mehr familienversichert, sondern als Studierender versicherungspflichtig, zahlen sie ab 01.01.2013 für die Krankenversicherung 64,77 Euro und 12,24 Euro für die Pflegeversicherung (ohne Kinder: 13,73 Euro

Das mit dem ""wenn man keine Leistungen in Anspruch nimmt"" wird offensichtlich bei denen per Prämienrückzahlung geregelt d.h. du bezahlst den normalen Tarif und falls du tatsächlich nie zum Arzt gegangen bist kriegst du dass am Ende des Jahres *zurück*. Von ""nicht bezahlen"" kann also in keinem Fall die Rede sein.

&gt; Als Mitglied der SECURVITA Krankenkasse können Sie einen Tarif wählen, mit dem
Ihnen Beiträge zurückgezahlt werden, sofern Sie ein Kalenderjahr keine kurativen Leistungen in Anspruch genommen haben. 

Fünfzehn Euro sind also so oder so Schwachsinn. Du bist nunmal in Deutschland gut krankenversichert deshalb kostet das halt auch Geld.

Vorschlag zur Güte: Such dir einen Job bei dem du deutlich mehr verdienst. Dann bleibt nach Abzug der Sachen wie Krankenkasse und Steuer trotzdem noch mehr übrig als du jetzt hast. Ist kein Witz oder Troll, es ist einfach teuer zu Leben und zu studieren und da muss man sich reinhängen. Mit nem Mini-Job kannst du das nicht auf Dauer finanzieren. Mach dir mal realistisch Gedanken ob studieren ne gute Idee ist wenn du dich nicht über Wasser halten kannst. Von jemandem der selbst in so ner Situation studiert hat.

- Les congés maladies ne sont pas payés au delà de 5 jours par an (cumulables, pfiou). Il y a 20 jours de congés (vacances) et 5 jours de congés (maladie/absence pour prendre soin de son compagnon/compagne et uniquement ça). Ca m'est déjà arrivé d'être malade 4 jours au début d'un nouveau poste et de me retrouver avec 3 jours sans solde. Ca pique un peu.

- Ta retraite est une espèce d'épargne versée par l'employeur et tu dois l'investir toi même. Quand la bourse se casse la gueule, tu perds 20% de ta retraite. Moyen bof quand tu as 64 ans et que tu compter partir bientôt.

- y'a zero remboursement pour les frais dentaires. Meme avec la meilleure mutuelle, y'a quand meme pas mal de procedures qui en sont de ta poche.

- les ambulances ne sont pas gratuites dans la plupart des etats.

- L'université est plus chère et tourne autour d'une espece d'emprunt que tu rembourses via tes impots quand tu passes un certain cap salarial.

Ensuite y'a les trucs qui ne sont pas forcement la faute du gouvernement:

- La vie est super chere. Le logement et les factures d'electricité font mal. Une voiture pas chere c'est 20 000 dollars. 

- Les transports publics sont...médiocres au mieux. Si t'as pas de voiture t'as intéret à vivre en plein centre ville.

- la construction laisse à faire. Avoir de l'isolation dans les murs ou du double vitrage est considéré un luxe. Le chauffage central à eau pareil. 

- leur pain est vraiment pas bon :( Le café est différent donc c'est une question de gout mais perso je préfère le café en France.

- Y'a pas vraiment de bonne bouffe abordable à toute heure. En France je sais que je peux aller à la boulangerie du coin pour acheter un sandwich frais et ptet une petite patisserie. Ici y'a un mcdo/kfc/burger king tous les coins de rue, quand c'est pas les trois à la fois. Les casse croute à la boulangerie, c'est des pizza sauce barbeque.

Perché non Rodotà.

La cosa peggiore è che mentre il Partito Democratico ha cercato un incontro col Movimento 5 Stelle per decidere un candidato comune (prima della prima votazione) il Movimento 5 Stelle ha rifiutato l’incontro, preferendo l’annuncio urbi et orbi “questo è il nostro candidato, votatecelo”.

Rodotà è stato rifiutato dal Partito Democratico perché è stato imposto forzatamente dal Movimento 5 Stelle… non c’è stato neanche un incontro, non c’è stato modo di discutere la cosa, semplicemente Rodotà è stato lanciato da Grillo sul web.

A quel punto se il Partito Democratico avesse accettato un diktat di quel genere sarebbe stata una caporetto perché sarebbe passata l’idea che il partito di maggioranza relativa è costretto non tanto a dialogare ma a sottomettersi alla volontà di un tizio che sta fuori e sbraita comandi.

Quello che meno gente ha notato è che dopo la quarta votazione il Partito Democratico ha cercato nuovamente d’incontrare il Movimento 5 Stelle per, con tutta probabilità, cercare una via d’uscita… ed ovviamente cos’hanno risposto i portavoce ? “Veniamo tutti e 163″, un modo come un altro per dire “no, il nostro ultimatum ce l’avete e dovete obbedire o andare a quel paese”.

A quel punto meglio Napolitano, no ?

E poi, molto semplicemente, visti gli infiniti tatticismi di Grillo non sarebbe stato impossibile che nel caso di una convergenza su Rodotà sarebbe stato il Movimento stesso a far “deragliare” l’elezione, giusto per dare la colpa al Partito Democratico… anche perché alla dirigenza del Movimento 5 Stelle di Rodotà non frega nulla, volevano solo la testa del Partito Democratico.",0,1366531957,null,0,false,0,c9jjhae,t3_1cshi5,t1_c9jjhae,t3_1cshi5,null,1431482334,7,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,7

It was the first single most imporaten constitutional law of the holy roman empire and the effects can still be seen today (germany with its federal states). 

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*[Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!
*In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.
*[Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.
*[Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 
*[Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing
*In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!
*Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

**Bamberg:**
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.
* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)
* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above
* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.bamberg-guide.de/bamberg/bierundbierkultur/kellerbilder/titelfoto-bearbeitet.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.
* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.
*Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recomment ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**
*[Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here
*[Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)
*Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see
*Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live, and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car.
*[Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremburg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle there and live there.
*[Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.
*The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.
*At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.


Traditional Food you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

true,yogavidya,earth,,"Buongiorno e scusatemi, provo a riallacciare i fili. 

Credo che siamo tutti sconvolti: l'esito appare, incredibilmente, come il peggiore immaginabile. Io lo vedo come una sorta di sigillo notarile che certifica in maniera definitiva che questa classe dirigente non è in grado, né ne ha la volontà, di fare altro che fotografare lo status quo, come se, non riuscendo a governare, la loro permanenza al potere fosse in sé un valore da tutelare.

Quindi possiamo partire da questo dato: da ieri è visibile per tutti che

1) la credibilità dello Stato è scesa ad un minimo storico, cosa che darà sempre più vigore a spinte di tipo anarchico o autoritario;

2) la priorità di questa classe dirigente è mantenere il proprio ruolo anche dopo aver dimostrato di essere incapaci di svolgerlo.

(Inciso: uso l'espressione ""classe dirigente"" perché penso alla classe politica, a tutta quella parte della macchina amministrativa che è di nomina politica o che con la politica scambia favori, ed alla dirigenza delle banche e dei servizi pubblici, sanità etc. similmente connessa alla politica).

Perché incapaci di svolgere il proprio ruolo? Perché, di fronte ad una colossale montante marea di merda, nel momento in cui il Paese lotta per la salvezza, la decisione dei nostri bagnini è, più o meno: ""io rimango sulla mia torre, ché non è il momento di fare cambiamenti pericolosi, e voi trattenete il respiro!""


Mi rendo conto che noi elettori di sinistra abbiamo continuato a sostenere quelli che pensavamo essere i nostri, pur inadeguati, rappresentanti politici in una lotta contro il male assoluto: ed invece, sotto le spoglie di un sistema bipolare, confermavamo un sistema di potere che è, nella natura predatoria e nei rituali, l'erede diretto della peggiore DC.


Traduco in meno parole: l'opposizione di sinistra è morta, ed il sistema di potere democristiano si è evoluto trasformandosi in una caricatura di sistema bipolare.

Il problema è che non abbiamo una classe dirigente di ricambio, se non a pezzi ed in embrione. Quindi, posto che non sarà facile ottenere la resa di una classe dirigente così determinata a non rinunciare al potere, chi governerà il Paese? Siamo, noi italiani, in grado di esprimere altro?

When they told me I was going to the prairies I thought WTF. My idea of Canada when I signed up was the east coast mainly. I went through a period of horrible homesickness at first, feeling so out of place in this tiny town in the middle of nowhere (but admittedly, 16year old me would probably have had a hard time anywhere. I was an insecure spoiled brat full of teenage certainties). It weren't for the family and especially for the mother I wouldn't have lasted  more than 2 months. They made me give it a try, take it one day at a time and loosen up. Things weren't the same as at home. So what.

So I stayed and got over myself. Those people were really wonderful, and I started to appreciate their country. The rolling hills. The starry nights. The one or two really picturesque streets downtown. The recency of history. Driving down a gravel road in the country one morning, turn a corner and there is a deer standing in front of us. Grain elevators at sunset. The badlands, so impressive. The huge coal mines. I loved the prairie cities when we visited, if only for the contrast, Regina, Saskatoon, Prince Albert, Calgary. But mostly the people. Such a welcoming, enterprising, positive and relaxed atmosphere, people back home suddenly felt so stuffed up and set in their ways.

In the end I hardly ever had felt so myself, so accepted and at so at home as in Saskatchewan, I couldn't imagine going back to Germany. It probably was my single best decision in my life to stay on. Whew, seemed I needed to say this. It always makes me sad when people make fun of the Middle West, my time there meant such a lot to me.

Breaking news, the same process to grant citizenship is almost the same to any country in the world. There is only very few country that does not accept right to apply for citizenship. BUT, some country ask for more criteria.

IO spero ancora in una soluzione che ci porti a risolvere la crisi (su vari fronti) in cui siamo ora.. e avere le istituzioni che funzionano e lavorano per farlo e' l'unico modo perche' questo processo sia democratico.

1.

2. NATO and/or EU-CSDP? The Petersburg tasks: humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks &amp; disarmament operations, tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking, and support to third countries in combating terrorism. In short the softer security elements separable, not separate from NATO’s obligation to manage territorial defence. 

Too many EU nations value the military alliance with the US and Canada via NATO, threaten that via tieing our defence and foreign policy into a supranational EU talking shop and we will cripple the evolution of EU defence rather than divorce the US. We know which is more effective!

About the language, you might miss a few jokes and have trouble understanding a few speaches, but I think a certain someone might be able to translate the general idea for you if you missed the meaning. Don't worry too much about your french, we know it is a hell of a language to learn, and that's why people here can often appreciate the effort. The elders might not speak english, but the younger generation will more likely be able and happy to talk to you (the children now learn english earlier in school, and with the internet a lot of people watch tv shows in english, read a lot more english,...)       
The only thing that often creates a problem is the accent. Many people here don't want to speak english in front of other french because they are a bit ashamed of their accents, which is sad, and I hope you won't worry about that and speak french as much as you can.            
For the wedding, the official stuff is done in the ""mairie"" and is very quick. If his family is religous, there is no way to avoid the wedding in a church without hurting his grand-ma's/mothers feelings. Religious people often ask for a full ceremony (mass), but I think you can choose exactly what will happen, how much religious stuff you want in there, letting you the choice to almost cut it down to the ""do you want to take .... for husband.""         
Since many people now feel obligated to marry in church as well to please religious family members, i don't think its a big deal that you are not yourself religious. If you have the right clergy person in front of you, he wont be a dick about it. (Or its because you are paying him..). And even as a non religous person, i can appreciate a wedding in a church, since it makes it feel more ""real"" and also makes it longer than just signing thr paper in front of the mayor/his staff.            
Usually in a wedding in church, one side of the room is to sit his side of the family, the other one to sit your side. I guess its not really a problem either, all of that stuff will be talked with the clergy man and you will use both sides for everybody.           
About the father walking down the isle,  you are not alone in this situation, it can be replaced by someone else. Same goes for the bridesmaids, i would advise you to try to make some friends, but you can even find a lady in his side of the family that you get along with well :)             
Other than that, the part I remember the most about wedding is usually after those ceremonies. The reception, dinner, dance, ... I can only speak for what I know and have seen, but the champagne usualy flows like crazy, and everybody is happy since its a happy reunions and some may be a bit tipsy ;)              
Tl;dr don't worry too much, everyone is different and there are no laws, you can replace one thing with another. Don't let the stress get to you , just be sure that is what You want, and enjoy and use the occasion to enjoy yourself and meet/get closer to his family.

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"One of the main differences between her and other politicians was that she was very ideological - she had an agenda, and she was willing to push that through without much (apparent) care for the side effects.

Some examples:

* There was [large-scale unemployment](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/26/newsid_2506000/2506335.stm). 13% on average, although in some areas it was much higher (20% in Northern Ireland and 15% through most of Scotland and the north of England).
* Scotland was treated ""[as a laboratory for experimentation](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/sep/16/conservatives.politics)"" for a deeply unpopular new form of tax (it was applied in Scotland a year before the other three countries in the UK).
* [Section 28](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28) was (essentially) based on the idea that being gay was immoral. There were similarly policies that could be considered ""racist"", such as widely expanded use of [stop-and-search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sus_law) powers for the police in London. With a great many of these there was, strictly speaking, no explicit bias. However in practice they were seen as reinforcing fairly standard right-wing agendas, and politicians of the time encouraged this in their speeches (e.g., Thatcher's criticism of ""[anti-racist mathematics](http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/106941)"", which was not previously known as a widespread problem in UK schools).
* An explicit policy of privatisation of public services, largely based on ideas from Milton Friedman. These were very new ideas in the UK at the time - previously the cultural feeling was typically ""public service X might be rubbish, but it's our rubbish"" (the newly privatised servies often required state subsidies, made those in charge extremely wealthy, and have a mixed record of actually providing a better service).
* Vociferously opposed to German unification. Despite proclaiming the right of self-determination, particularly for the citizens of the USSR, it had its limits.
* Introduced legislation to reduce the influence of trade unions. Not in itself a problem, however the timing (1980, 1982, 1984, 1988, 1989, 1990) makes it clear it was very much an arms race approach to reducing influence - every few years, what was legal became illegal. Some of these sound quite sensible (requiring secret ballots to prevent peer pressure), some seem quite obvious spoiler tactics (allowing individual citizens to sue against 'unlawful' industrial action that deprives them of goods and services - making a strike much riskier to participate in).

Aside from the issues with the unions, the other attribute people associate with her time in power is the growth of inequality.

Right now it's a container for a wide range of anti-euro/conspiracy/populist ideas, fueled by the present rampant income inequality and general distrust towards the political parties.

In some respects it is similar to what Lega Nord was at the beginning, just without the open regionalist/xenophobe connotations. Their slogan was ""Roma ladrona"" (robber Rome), meaning that Lega Nord would have cleansed all political corruption in the parliament. Eventually they did not, and they soon benefited extensively from the very same system - that's also why they have survived as a party throughout the years. It is unlikely that Grillo's party is going to have this chance.

Taken as a party, it moved a few steps forward on B.'s footprints towards quite a dangerous path: all in all, B.'s party is still composed of established politicians, and whatever display of hostility towards judges or other institutions has been a limited role-play to protect the personal interests of the Boss.

If you're going to eat fast food more like 250€.

true,magda13,null,null,"I grew up in a small town next to Radolfzell, so I know the place;) The lake Bodensee is great, really beautiful in summer and you even can see the Alps on nice days. Radolfzell is rather small compared to Singen (which is quite close, but not so interesting) and Konstanz. 

Konstanz has a nice old town and a good night life (cause there's a big university). The nightclubs ""Kantine"", ""Blechnerei"" and ""Berry's"" are good, as far as  I know. In Radolfzell I only know one nightclub, which is called ""s'Bokle"" and it's very Indie/Alternative/Rock. In Singen are some good nightclubs too, like ""Top10"" and ""Erdbeermund"", but I'd say Konstanz is the best;).

There are lot of things to see at the lake, but most of the tourists stuff is mainly for familys or elder people... There's a nice island close to Konstanz, ""Mainau"", there's a castle and a lot of flowers on it, but the entrance is really expensive. You could also check out some other cities at the lake if you have time, like Lindau, Meersburg (take the ferry or ship from Konstanz!) or Überlingen.

I recommend you to go to Switzerland, cause it's a different country and it looks different, too. Go see Schaffhausen (the waterfall and the city center), Stein am Rhein is a small old town next to the rhine which is really worth a visit. But Switzerland is expensive too, so you might not want to stay for coffee...

At the other side of the lake is Bregenz, which is in Austria. There's a mountain with a cable car to the top, from which you have a nice view over the whole lake and all the way to the alps, if the weather is fine ;)

If you want to get around in Germany you can go to Freiburg, which I personally really like, or to some swabian towns like Tübingen or Rottenburg, they have this old german town style.

In my personal opinion, Radolfzell has a normal prize level, but in Konstanz or other ""more touristical"" areas you pay more. Mainly because a lot of Swiss people with money come to Germany to shop or eat cause it's still cheap compared to Switzerland.

I don't live at the Bodensee anymore, so I hope you and your friends have a nice stay in my home country and if you have more question feel free to ask ;)

&gt;By Peter Spiegel in Brussels and Peter Ehrlich in Berlin

&gt;Flaws found last week in an academic treatise on the effect of high public debt on economic growth have heaped pressure on governments to relax austerity, above all in crisis-stricken Europe, long seen as an incubator for austerity-driven policies.

&gt;But even before the arguments among economists over the merits of expansionary fiscal contraction reached a new pitch, policy makers in the eurozone had begun to ease up – with the tacit approval of disciplinarian Germany.

&gt;As many as six eurozone countries have received or are seeking waivers on tough EU-mandated deficit targets when they come up for review next month, a move that has thus far met little objection from Berlin – an unexpected acquiescence that has led many to believe the anti-austerity camp is suddenly in ascendance in Brussels, at least for now.

&gt;“The speed of consolidation is certainly going to be lower now,” said Guntram Wolff, an economist at the influential Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. “The European Commission has agreed on that already.”

&gt;Olli Rehn, the commission’s top economic official, has frequently cited the central finding of the now-disputed study – co-authored by Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff – that economic growth falls drastically in countries when sovereign debt rises above 90 per cent of gross domestic product.

&gt;In an interview, Mr Rehn – who is responsible for deciding whether eurozone countries will be allowed to miss their deficit targets – said that while he has “cited this study in the past as illustrative”, he insisted that his office does not set its policy on “any single piece of research”.

&gt;“We design our policies on the basis of a holistic assessment drawing on a wealth of studies – but also of course on our own analyses,” Mr Rehn said.
Indeed, Mr Rehn himself has frequently been in the vanguard of EU officials insisting that blindly sticking to headline deficit targets is counterproductive, arguing instead that countries should be judged more on reform programmes to liberalise their economies.

&gt;Mr Rehn’s push, which has backing of the International Monetary Fund, has already gained traction in bailout countries, where Greece has been given two more years to reduce its deficit below the EU-mandated 3 per cent of GDP and Portugal last month was granted a second year’s leniency.

&gt;Elsewhere in the eurozone periphery, Spain was given a pass this year and is expected to get a further waiver in May. And Italy, where nervous markets are watching the political turmoil closely, was given the green light to spend an extra €40bn in unpaid government bills despite the risk of breaching its 3 per cent barrier.

&gt;But the weakening economic picture is also wreaking havoc on “core” eurozone countries, with both France and the Netherlands publicly acknowledging they, too, will miss their 3 per cent targets this year.

&gt;Such leniency has been resisted by senior German central bankers, but it has been met with resignation by the German government, which instead has signalled it will mount more resistance in 2014, after this year’s national election. Chancellor Angela Merkel last week sought to play down the issue, saying France’s impending breach was “not new” to her, telling reporters she would leave it up to Mr Rehn to decide.

&gt;Instead, she insisted Paris had to present measures to keep its deficit in line with EU rules next year – a clear sign Berlin would accept a 3.7 per cent French deficit this year but would put pressure on Paris to deepen economic reforms.

&gt;“It would be good for France to start structural reforms immediately because the positive impacts of reforms take time”, Michael Meister, the financial affairs spokesman for Ms Merkel’s Christian Democrats in the Bundestag, told the FT.

&gt;Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, backed last year’s easing in Spain, Portugal and Greece, and government officials said he would not risk a big fight with France as long as the eurozone remained economically fragile.

&gt;In a further sign of growing acceptance in Berlin, during Thursday’s Bundestag debate over the €10bn Cypriot bailout – which the German parliament passed overwhelmingly – Mr Schäuble took the unusual step of expressing concern for the economic upheaval in the eurozone’s periphery.

&gt;“The people in Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal and now Cyprus are living in hard times,” he said, before adding: “They have to suffer during the reforms to have the chance of a better future.” Ms Merkel has struck a similar position in recent interviews, telling Bild newspaper that southern Europe “more or less have started the reforms they need”.

&gt;It could be a difficult balance for Ms Merkel to strike in an election year. Even as she shows empathy with the economic difficulties of southern eurozone countries, she cannot be seen to ally herself with French President François Hollande’s increasingly vocal crusade against austerity.

&gt;“There is nowadays much talk about austerity”, Ms Merkel told reporters last week. While the Reinhart-Rogoff findings may be in doubt, Ms Merkel said she felt debt in the eurozone was still too high. “That is of course not good in the long run”.

&gt;Pierluigi Bersani è un povero disgraziato… probabilmente uno dei migliori politici

Non sono tanto d'accordo. È stato un bravo ministro in passato, è sicuramente una persona ""paternale"" nella politica, ma come politico e leader è un disastro. Non sa parlare ai suoi elettori in maniera chiara e concisa, carisma zero e soprattutto negli ultimi tempi, più dedito alla fuga dai giornalisti che altro. Un partito non può permettersi un leader simile quando hai comunicatori esperti come Berlusconi e Grillo che ti stanno mangiando vivo e con ogni morso ti strappano elettori su elettori. Non ti puoi mettere a cazzeggiare con cose tipo smacchiamo il giaguaro, l'unico a trovare lo slogan decente è Crozza che sa su cosa spendere 15 minuti del suo show. 

&gt;ad oggi questa linea non sembra essere quella di “mandare a casa” la casta, sembra piuttosto quella di uccidere il Partito Democratico senza toccare il Popolo delle Libertà che, grazie all’attacco continuo e costante al solo Bersani [su Grillo]

No. Grillo sono ANNI che se la prende con tutto il cerchio magico del PD dal suo blog. La Bindi, Letta, Franceschini, D'Alema, ce n'è per tutti. E il PDL? Idem, solo che ormai sparare sul PDL è come sparare sulla croce rossa.

The guys in S and SF knew this as well.

People got used to not seeing military being used for anything civilian, and many people aren't exactly great fans of the military (Compulsory military service that was only abolished a few years ago played a part in that). Military is mostly just seen as unfit for doing anything civilian. We Germans even have a word for that: ""Zivilversager"" which is an insult describing someone who is serving in the military for a long time just because of failing at leading a civilian life.

Using the military as a source of equipment and manpower in case of a disaster has for a long time been the only exception from the rule never to use military for anything but defense, but it's still seen as the first step down a slippery slope by some. That's mostly the reason for the politicians sending military to help with that flood got some shit.

I have some experience with an American relative who has multiple sclerosis (MS), and has been receiving ""permanent disability"" benefits for a long time. At an earlier stage of the disease, it was somewhat cyclic: he would have major flare-ups for 3-24 months at a time, when he was completely unable to work, sometimes unable to get out of bed. But then he would be okay for months or years at a time. But he was advised *not* to work in the intermediate period, because the fact that he could work would be taken as proof that he wasn't really ""permanently disabled"", so he would lose his benefits and not be able to get them back again if his MS flared up again. This situation of course wasn't good for either him or the state, since it would've been better for him to work in the periods when he was able to.

In the last few years the disease has been much worse, and he can barely take care of himself, even not working. But the disability benefit is only $1000/mo, which he mostly uses to pay his rent and buy food, so he can't afford to hire someone to help him out, or to move into an assisted-living apartment which has a nurse and assistants on staff. Instead he tries to live alone, which he can't really do. So periodically he will end up injuring himself or getting an infection, in which case he has to go to the hospital. Then the government *will* pay for that: he stays in the hospital for sometimes a month or two at a time, because they can't legally release him until he can safely leave the hospital. This is worse for both him and the state, compared to if they had just paid enough benefits for him to live in an assisted-living facility. But the reasoning is that people might abuse that, but nobody would abuse going to the hospital periodically, since it's much less pleasant.",0,1366555449,null,0,false,0,c9jmpua,t3_1csny2,t1_c9jmpua,t1_c9jmekt,null,1431480808,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Of course they don't, but it's better not to push for everything at once, and do it rationally.

So, they just made a monetary union, without any fiscal union, and transfers union.

&gt;So either let the ECB do a proper central bank job to buy us the time

Banking union will expand ECB's powers greatly. However, it still won't be able to do QE. Instead, it'll be able to go in and take bad assets out of the economy, and flood the economy with money.

[Separating law and politics in Romania](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/guest-post-separating-law-and-politics-in-romania/)

Since last july politics here was all ""Jos Basescu"" and *nothing else*. In december we had general elections, with PDL (former ruling party, EPP member) basically disintegrating and the USL coalition (socialists + liberals) getting a huge 70% majority in the parliament, as expected. Very recently we saw it toned down a bit as some agreement was seemingly reached between the president and PM on judicial issues - which pissed off both sides.

Traian Basescu lost popular support due to the austerity measures he supported and pushed for, while also being a total dick about it (as well as most other issues). PDL support also vanished due to gross incompetence and corruption.

So we're now left with a disgustingly populist USL government whose people are remarkably inept and/or corrupt. Worst is they're undoing some of the good reform prev. gov. did, under pressure from various interest groups.

Note that the ""issue"" with the president is so polarized that one can only be a ""stinkin' băsist"" or a ""stinkin' commie"", a balanced view in media or public opinion may be hard to find.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As everything, it's far from perfect but I am generally very happy with it. Recent reforms have pushed it even more in the right direction and given news about recent data regarding the financial situation of the health funds, it's currently fairly efficient and stable.

I'm 22 and given that I have not yet finished my higher education after school (i.e. apprenticeship or Master's/equivalent degree), I have never paid even a single cent into the system and won't have to do so until I am 25 or finish my aforementioned education as everyone not fulfilling these criteria is insured through one of their parent's (family) insurance for free. If you're 25 or older and still a student, you only have to pay around 70€ a month for your insurance. Until recently for the last few years they introduced a copay of 10€ for your first doctor's visit in a quarter year (except for your yearly dentist check-up which was free). This fee has been waived as of 2013. There also are small copays for prescription medication (with exceptions for chronic patients) and hospital visit, both capped on a per-item and yearly basis. People on the dole of course are exempt from copays. Not sure how it works for the 11% of the population that is privately insured but it seems similar. I'm generally against this split of public and private insurance as this is a reason why the public system can't function at 99%+ of its efficiency.

I've never had a reason to complain. Basically anything that would qualify as a sickness or disease is covered. The same applies to basic prophylactic needs and some cosmetic problems if they impede with your daily life or psyche. I can go to the dentist for a yearly check-up with some basic prophylactic cleaning and if keep that up for several years, I am eligible for a relative reimbursement depending on the years I kept up with my prophylaxis should I ever need some fancy fake teeth made.

Getting a quick doctor's appointment usually works very well but it depends more on the region you are living in than on the system as a whole; though they recently introduced incentives for doctors to move into more rural areas.

Many doctor's also allow walk-ins without an appointment but then you have to wait little to quite a lot longer depending on how many people with appointments are there and when you can be shoe-horned in. Generally I get normal appointments within 2-3 days with a waiting time of maybe 5-10 minutes. I had the odd one out once with a waiting time of an hour despite the appointment because there were some older patients in front of me requiring some more extensive tests that were done right there and then. Then again the doctor also gave me a good amount of attention, so I'm fine with that. If you're flexible and won't mind an appointment in the early morning, even in my small non-rich city you can get an appointment on the next day without waiting times.

If you're some form of emergency (expecting yourself to be one is enough of a reason), you can get to the doctor immediately. Generally I feel it's a fair way of doing things. Obviously, seeing a specialist might take a while longer, depending on your urgency. My grandpa with freshly found cancer had all his preparations, check-ups and operations done within a week and a half maybe while my physiotherapy began like 3 weeks after they found out that my foot was slightly crooked.

Sometimes you meet the limits of the system which can be a tad frustrating but it never is anything major that would significantly affect your life. I for example started to get bad eyesight and had to pay for the glasses myself (the check-up was free of course). I at least had expected to be eligible for a reimbursement for the cheapest glasses available (~40€) and everything fancy above that would have to be paid by me. But apparently my sight wasn't bad enough and I had to pay it completely (which ended up being 200€ for a stable frame and scratch-proof thin glasses).

All in all people seem to be content with the system apart from a few black marks which includes:

* doctors (especially in hospital) could use a pay rise here and there
* being a nurse is very stressful and not paid enough for for what they have to go through
* hospital hygiene is not as good as e.g. in the Netherlands
* apparently some operations are not entirely necessary but chosen over non-invasive treatment methods because the health funds pay more for them

So generally the hospital part of health needs a few more reforms before we can call it more than adequate to good.

1) I believe that it depends on the year but on average around 80k people dealing with the public sector where in the medium range corruption mode (40k-100k with an average at like 50k, in 2009 money, what they'd make outside the public sector would be at 25k max). Most of them promoted beaurocarts, the deko+ote+olympiaki, ngo's, small scale hidden procurements contracts subsidies deals bribes and that shit.

2) There are also 100k+ at the 15k scale, those in the completely useless jobs or stealing benefits by calling up someone etc

3) There are also the big fishes (100-1000 entities?) who could charge the greek state for more

4) and then  the oligarchs




So the examples I gave where in the direction that




a) they all depend on the existence of the public sector in its current state 

b) No proposed ""political voulisi"" change will really change the system, the only thing that will work is it getting less funds, you are in the country of oti diloseis eisai

c) No plan to change Europe or sth will ever work in the next 30 years

d) The outside the public sector part of the population is almost economically discriminated against, meanwhile that discrimination being in a large part still in favor of those who abused the dimosio!

e) the public sector getting bailed out hurts ""the economoical climate"" (also all the corruption that stops businesses in greece is part of it, the guys that demand extra money or else you won't get the liscence in 12 months etc. and they expect you to join a cartel and stories like that)

They represent the slowly dying part of the population who still thinks our country gives a shit about religious morals. There aren't much of them left but they can be loud sometimes. In this case, their feeling of religious righteousness + the fact that it's France ended up in a pretty large demonstration. Given that we demonstrate for anything, it would have surprised me if nothing had happened for such a topic. They came up with the silliest arguments, just like the american christians who feel ""persecuted"" ; they said the government was forcing the bill on us, denying our values and democracy, that it was a tyranny..

Το πρόβλημα που έχω με την επιχειρηματολογία σου είναι ότι είσαι της λογικής ""πονάει κεφάλι, κόψει κεφάλι"". Αν διαλυθεί το δημόσιο τελείως μετά θα έχεις άλλα προβλήματα. Επίσης, ο τρόπος με τον οποίο υπολογίζεις τους κηφίνες του δημοσίου είναι υπερβολικός και δεν έχεις αρκετά στοιχεία για να το υποστηρίξεις.

So when we get onto the question of how we enforce the payment of these taxes, I say, the same way we enforce taxes already: Through the European Court which imposes fines on member states. What happens if the EU state does not pay its fine? Well, then we'll have a constitutional crisis. Perhaps the EU state would be forced to leave, or at the very least, withdraw from that chapter. 

Basically, the European Union is a much stricter organisation than NATO. If a country does not do what it's supposed to in the EU, then the EU does have real and immediate power to punish. NATO has no such power. 

So I don't think countries not paying their way would be an issue, assuming a common European army was set up properly, which is a big ask. I'm speaking of an ideal world.

While they constantly talk about banning the NPD and already have attempted it once, they're basically funding much of the NPD's and other right wing groups' activities by hiring a lot their members as confidential informants. (The first attempt to ban the NPD failed in court because it was impossible to tell how much of the evidence against them was genuine and not produced by the informants themselves)

Also right wing extremist involvement in crime is downplayed on a regular basis, with the most prominent cause being three Neo-Nazis going around and murdering immigrant business owners for 10 years until they got caught. The series of fuck-ups in the investigation of this case is ridiculous.

* At least one of their murders happened right under the eyes of an undercover observer (He ""accidentally"" ""happened to have just stepped outside for a moment"" while they shot the owner of the Internet Cafe where he was sitting in).
* The series of murders wasn't even recognized as connected for years despite all the victims being small business owners of either Turkish or Greek origin.
* Political motives were dismissed in very early stages of investigations in favor of some fictional Turkish Mafia. (In one city, the police even opened an undercover Döner shop in order to catch the ""Turkish Mafia"")
* When the three Neo-Nazis shot a police officer, the police were hunting a ""phantom"" based on DNA ""evidence"" resulting from contaminated swabs. It took months to realize that the DNA was from a worker in the factory that made the swabs.
* They were actually being under observation before they went underground and had been supplied with fake IDs by their observers.

That's only the few facts I remember without having to look them up.

&gt;off-shore asylum facilities

Australia is VERY different to Europe in terms of geography and how immigration and asylum seeking works. We're an island with no connections (tunnels or bridges) to our neighbours, the only way to gain access is by sea or air. To our north is a string of much poorer countries. They hire people smugglers to get on a boat, and ship them to Australian waters where, when they get spotted by an Australian vessel, put holes in their boat to sink it so the Australian vessel is forced to take them all aboard, and hence Australia is responsible for them. This has three problems. First, many of these asylum seekers were in 'safe countries' that they were supposed to be able to claim asylum in before they got to Australia. Second, a lot of these boats are old and shitty (after all they intend to sink them), and so a good number of people drown. Third, this means that refugees waiting in the huge aid camps in Africa lose their place to asylum seekers that already found safe countries to stay in. The off short processing policy was aimed at mitigating those three factors. I don't agree with it, but that's what it is.

&gt;Most Australians will give a similar response to questions about the Abbos that Europeans does to Gypsies. But I bet it's the blue-collar workers fault, right?

&gt;yet once you hit a workplace that doesn't require very rare skills outside of the multinationals people start looking very similar to each other.

This is patently false, given that if you walk around in the Melbourne Central Business District 30-50% of the people walking in business suits look Asian, South Asian or Black.

Making certain assumptions based on one's race or appearance is inevitable and I don't think most of these assumptions are harmful to society. 

What is a severe problem (especially in Europe) is xenophobia, this is fear/hatred of *foreignness* and the desire to cleanse the nation/continent of foreign characteristics is one of Europe's biggest cancers and I think one of the most harmful things society tolerates. What's concerning is that the social/political response to rampant xenophobia in European countries seems to be in favour of restricting foreignness rather than being on reducing xenophobia through education for example. The euphemism used here is ensuring those with foreign traits 'integrate' and 'assimilate', i.e. stop speaking foreign languages, get rid of their foreign name and choose one that is not foreign, and generally get rid of any traits that may be viewed as foreign. This is pandering to xenophobia, meaning the xenophobia is still there (and untreated) but has fewer things to complain about. Examples of this include the ban on veils in France/Belgium, minarets in Switzerland and the crackdown on foreign restaurants in Italy. 

Some people will counter this by saying 'some cultures are worse than others so why should we allow these cultures in Europe?' but this is a clumsy argument and if taken literally advocates fascism (banning culture or laws against culture). In reality, actions which are harmful to individuals' civil liberties and human rights and are generally seen within immigrant populations, e.g. honour killings, FGM, forced marriage are already banned and the best/well-equipped institutions fighting against such acts originate themselves from those immigrant communities (Karma Nirvana in the UK for example in relation to forced marriage).

A severe problem in Europe is immigrant crime.

&gt;one of Europe's biggest cancers and I think one of the most harmful things society tolerates. 

The biggest cancer we tolerate is the foreign culture fetishism of people like yourself that erode our western values in extremely regressive ways. 

&gt;to be in favour of restricting foreignness rather than being on reducing xenophobia through education for example. 

Education leads to taking a hard look at foreign cultures and treating them more objectively thus the xenophobia. Multicultists like yourself operate entirely on your feelings.

&gt;The euphemism used here is ensuring those with foreign traits 'integrate' and 'assimilate'

That's just the basis of a proper immigration policy. That's not even a xenophobic argument like the deportation debates.

&gt;(and untreated) 

The notion that it's something to cure is silly in the extreme and paints a much worse picture of yourself than you think.

&gt;but this is a clumsy argument and if taken literally advocates fascism (banning culture or laws against culture)

It's neither a clumsy argument nor is that the definition of fascism.

Ensuite, l'Europe n'a aucune politique économique voire même aucune politique tout court vis-à-vis de la Chine. Certains parlent de naïveté, d'autres d'impuissance mais la réalité c'est que l'Europe n'est pas suffisamment ""altruiste"" pour voire émerger une politique face au géant chinois ou même américain.

In my opinion people don't go to markets as much as before for a few different reasons:
- On one hand convenience (markets have worse times/schedules) is an important factor. Supermarkets open longer etc.
- Competition: In a lot of neighbourhoods there's shops (not supermarkets nor general grocery stores) where you can buy meat/vegetables at very competitive prices (particularly with fruit, I'm always impressed by the prices in a fruit shop right by my house).

Finally, I think a lot of people just don't know what to buy and rather go to more processed/easier to prepare/ready-made meals.

&gt;Election fever in Berlin obscures need for banking union

&gt;Germany’s parliament voted by an overwhelming majority last week in favour of a €10bn international rescue programme for Cyprus and a seven-year extension of crisis loans to Ireland and Portugal. The vote served as a useful reminder to Germany’s critics that the eurozone’s dominant economic power is not shirking its responsibility to protect the 17-nation area’s unity by providing assistance for its weaker members.

&gt;The vote also showed the importance attached by the ruling Christian Democrats, the opposition Social Democrats and Germany’s other mainstream parties to acting in the eurozone crisis with, as far as possible, a political consensus at national level. This strengthens Germany’s hand in international negotiations, but it also blunts the suspicions of domestic voters that Germany is making a foolish mistake by rescuing eurozone nations viewed as reckless overspenders.

&gt;Such considerations are important now that the campaign for Germany’s September 22 federal election is warming up. Understandably, Angela Merkel, the CDU chancellor, wants to marry her strategy for overcoming the eurozone crisis with a strategy for winning re-election. There will be no electoral prizes for making commitments to deeper, faster European integration that voters might take as a sign that Germany will be landed with most of the bill.

&gt;Uncertainty over the composition of the next government, even if it is CDU-led, will also be a factor in Ms Merkel’s calculations. The emergence of Alternative für Deutschland, a group that aims to dissolve the eurozone in its present form, means that the continuation of the coalition between the CDU and its liberal Free Democrat partners cannot be taken for granted. The new group may not cross the 5 per cent threshold of the national vote needed to enter parliament, but it may take enough votes from both parties to require Ms Merkel to turn to the Social Democrats or even the Greens to form a new coalition.

&gt;In such circumstances it is easy to see why the cautious, step-by-step approach that has characterised Germany’s handling of the eurozone crisis will not change before September, and probably not thereafter. Yet if Germany’s commitment to holding the eurozone together is not in doubt, and a certain slowness in decision-making reflects German political conditions, other countries – beyond the eurozone as well as within it – are justified in asking for more clarity about how Berlin sees Europe’s future and proposes to build it.

&gt;Here the central issue is eurozone banking union. A single bank supervisory mechanism is on course to be established by next March. But Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister, has cast doubt on how soon the eurozone will acquire a resolution authority to deal with failing banks by suggesting that such an innovation needs changes to the EU’s basic treaty. As he well knows, such changes may take years to agree, and time is not a luxury at Europe’s disposal.

&gt;Mr Schäuble was perhaps merely looking for a way to keep the question out of the election campaign. But on the third pillar of banking union – a common deposit guarantee scheme – there are doubts about Germany’s willingness to move ahead even after the election. A comprehensive banking union in the modern world needs a deposit guarantee scheme. The eurozone will not fully emerge from crisis until it has one. Germany is right to demand credible economic reform and fiscal self-discipline from its partners, but in return it must take the lead on banking union. In this context it would be helpful for the politicians running in the election to remind voters that the German economy has benefited greatly from the euro’s introduction and no effort should be spared to secure the currency’s future.

&gt;The interesting part is ""estimé que la différence de situation entre les couples de même sexe et les couples composés d'un homme et d'une femme peut justifier une différence de traitement quant aux règles du droit de la famille ; qu'il n'appartient pas au Conseil constitutionnel de substituer son appréciation à celle du législateur sur la prise en compte, en cette matière, de cette différence de situation ;""

&gt;""[has concluded] that the difference in situation between same sex couples and couples made of a man and a woman can justify different treatments by family ; that it is not for the Constitutional Council to substitute its will to the one of the lawmaker, in this matter, about the difference in situation"". 

&gt;If the law passes, they will not censor it : they said it was up to the lawmaker ie the people or the Parliament, not to them.

&gt;You have to remember that the Constitutionnal Council was designed with the idea not to have judicial activism [which is why it is a council, not a court and the members are not judges, unlike the Supreme Court] by De Gaulle, and since most of its members are Gaullist, they stick to this idea.

On peut noter l'ironie que les opposants auraient pu obtenir un référendum via le référendum d'initative populaire (qui est très différent de la Suisse, notamment parce qu'il faut un certain nombre de parlementaires, IIRC 60, pour que l'initiative aboutisse), mais la droite au pouvoir a oublié, entre la réforme de 2008 et le départ de Sarkozy en 2012 de rédiger et promulguer les décrets d'application.

Il y à une part de vrai dans tes observations, en France on essaye d'enlever la responsabilité de la retraite aux gens, afin qu'ils ne s'en soucient pas (jusqu'à dernièrement avec les problèmes de caisses qui sont en quasi faillite en tout cas), aux USA, on estime que la responsabilité est partagée entre la personne et la communauté.

Je suis pas forcément fan du système américain, beaucoup plus complexe, normé et illisible qu'on ne pourrait le penser. Mais à titre personnel je ne pense pas qu'il soit mauvais que l’individu, surtout plus aisé contribue à sa propre épargne plutôt que récupérer de l'argent de la communauté.

A mon avis, le juste milieu serait qu'on verse un minimum correct à ceux qui ont cotisés pour leur retraite, identique pour tous, et le reste doit être capitalisé.
Les taxes sur les dividendes et intérêts des uns sont utilisés pour permettre à ceux qui n'ont pas pu cotiser, typiquement les vieux dans les payage comme tu le dis :)
Je sais que la capitalisation n'est pas forcément quelque chose d'apprécié en France, mais je pense qu'il serait plus saint pour tous le monde que ceux qui gagne assez ne touche pas à l'argent que la société met en commun pour les nécessiteux, et ils devraient trouver leurs propres moyens de combler leur rente.
Typiquement un ouvrier non qualifié va jamais pouvoir cotiser de quoi toucher une retraite complète, il se retrouve avec moins que son salaire, alors qu'un cadre, même s'il touche pas le pension complète touchera quand même plus que l'ouvrier. Serait honnête que les deux cotisent pareils et que l'on taxe le cadre sur ses gains d'épargne pour payer la caisse commune.

Après il y à le phénomène des américains qui n'arrêtent jamais de travailler, certains n'ont pas besoin de le faire mais n'ont pas envie d’arrêter de travailler et d'être utile à la communauté, ils ne veulent pas être un poids pour la société. J'imagine que ça doit en concerner un petit nombre.

Bref je me suis un peu éparpillé, en tout cas rien de personnel, c'est juste que la phrase m'a paru étrange sur le moment.

I've been watching German language programs recently, over the internet, and it was food for thought to see how the word ""Gerecht"" or ""Gerechtigkeit"" is used. It equally means ""justice,"" ""fairness,"" and ""equity."" I realized that this word would never work as a translation for ""justice"" as defined in the American sense. People who are arguing that folks should get the electric chair aren't asking for ""fairness"" or ""equity""  - they are asking for vengeance to be taken.

I grew up in the Pacific Northwest USA, and certainly that's a regional bubble (which perhaps can be said to extend along the West Coast more generally) where people are more familiar with the meanings of justice and patriotism which might coincide with a foreign English speaker's sense of that word. However, I believe that if one's honest, one cannot deny that in the USA generally, the words are really colored by the meanings I have described above.

Admission is free and they have guided tours and self guided audio tours in several languages.

Cologne has a lot to offer, too. Apart from the obvious – the cathedral – there are a lot of museums, especially targeted on the roman history of the city. When you’re there, you should consider taking a guided tour, because you won’t find all the interesting stuff by yourself (for example: parts of the roman city gate are still there, but since the roman Cologne is buried under the modern city, you will find it inside the parking garage next to the cathedral :-)).

If you want to visit a castle and don’t have that much time to travel, you can visit [Schloss Augustusburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustusburg_and_Falkenlust_Palaces,_Br%C3%BChl) in Brühl – right in the middle between Cologne and Bonn.

Furthermore, selectively presented data often leads to incorrect conclusions; in the previous example, increased criminality can very likely be better linked with citizens' economic status, thus the correlation with immigration from poorer countries.

Και η απάντηση που δίνουνε μπορεί να είναι ότι θα τα παίρνεις λέει από σούπερ μάρκετ και δεν θα έχεις προσωπική σχέση με τον φαρμακοποιό της γειτονιάς. Η λες για τον στρατό που σε ποσοστό πήγαινε παραπάνω χρήμα από ότι σε όλο ΝΑΤΟ και θα αρχίσουν να σε λένε για τον βατραχάνθρωπο που τσαλαβουτάει λέει στα σύνορα και μας φυλάει από τον Τούρκο για 800 ευρώ.

Φυσικά τώρα ΑΝΕΛ αλλά πήγε και στην συγκέντρωση ΣΥΡΙΖΑ θεωδοράκη κτλ ώστε να πολεμήσει την Μέρκελ καλύτερα
