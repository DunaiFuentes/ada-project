I looked at a few recipes, and they all start by a sourdough. This is something that they all assume that you have already, so you need to make one first. It appears to be very easy:

Equal parts of rye flour and butter milk. Mix it and put it in a bag or a sealed container and leave it in the fridge for a week. There are other recipes, but this appears to be the easiest.

When you have to bake the actual bread, you take 3 deciliter of your sourdough, mix it with 0.5 liter of rye kernels, 0.5 liter of rye flour. Then remove one deciliter of the mix and add to the removed part one deciliter of water and one deciliter of wheat flour. This goes back into your sourdough. 

Take the original mix, add 0.5 liter of wheat flour and a table spoon of salt. At this point you can also add sunflower seeds, linseed, etc. About 1 deciliter of each. Mix it all very well, so that there are no pockets of flour. Put the dough in a form that has been greased up with butter. Let it rise for 12 hours, covered with a damp cloth. Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes at 200 degrees C. Take it out and let it cool for about 4 hours before cutting. If you want a less crusty crust, you can let it cool inside a plastic bag. 

Good luck and have fun.

I wonder if crowd sourcing offers any good ideas for a modern participatory government.

Today we have so much potential untapped in the extreme speed in the spread of information, and I would say so much that we can even do away with most of the power that our representatives hold today.

I'm going to start explaining the system like you are five, because I think it could easily get confusing. Here is a list of key ideas:

- All votes are digital, thus internet access would have to be a human right.
- Voting can be changed on the fly.
- A representative is worth exactly as many votes as they got.
- A voter can be their own representative.
- A representative votes on issues with all the votes that he/she is a representative for. 
- A voter can change the direction of her/his vote regardless of how the representative votes. If they do not, their vote follows what their representative votes automatically.
- If neither representative or voter takes a stance on an issue they abstain.
- A voter can change their representative at any time.
- You have no parliament. The political debate is a public forum.
- The government is a group of voters approved as government by the voters/representatives.

Something like that would severely weaken the establishment, but also require a very good media or it could easily fall prey to demagogues and propaganda.

true,QWieke,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; I personally see the ""jury of peers"" as a democratization of the justice system.

The idea of democratic justice system makes me a bit uneasy. I think justice should be about objective truth (or as objective as it can get) and democracy definitely isn't. Democracy already has a say in justice via the legislative process, they get to define what is and isn't illegal. Someone's guilt shouldn't be up for popular vote, it should be determined as objectively and rationally as possible.

----

&gt; The sourcing of legislation would still remain the same, the voting would be crowed sourced.

I didn't make this clear in my previous post but I wouldn't want the actual voting on legislation to be done by the crowd. The representatives should still be the ones to vote and the ones responsible for the whole thing. I just would like to make the process as transparent as possible (with strictly time limited exceptions for secret matters) and give the representatives access to crowd sourcing as a tool to use as they see fit. Transparency shouldn't be optional. Of course they're going to get feedback from the crowd whether they like it or not and the loudest ones will be best heard, but that's a feature of any democracy.

(edit:) Part of the issue with a participatory democracy is that there ought to be a good balance between the influence of the general elections and the influence of the participatory system. We shouldn't penalize those little interest in politics.

&gt; Think about this scenario, 1000 representatives annually selected anonymously from all of our countries voting for legislation. Legislators that actually would need convincing to vote for something. Lobby groups and law proponents that actually had to explain their opinions A faceless agora of voters made of apolitical commoners, the royalty of Europe would weep for weeks.

Though neither aspect is all good or all bad, people with an internal locus of control generally feel more efficacious and in control of their lives which leads to a better sense of well-being.

You should really pick someone who you think shares your values and trust them to make an informed choices. The problem is none of us like it when our representative looks into the issue carefully and then decides that our opinions are wrong. Although perhaps it's not unreasonable that we don’t like it given how much our politicians are influenced by big business.

I would prefer some sortition in the political system. That way you could have full-time politicians who are genuinely representative of the population and not dependent on big business to get elected, but I can’t see Europe ever going for it.

Non sto difendendo la RAI, che ha millemila problemi e dovrebbe essere sì essere rivoltata come un calzino. Ma da qui a dire che il concetto di servizio pubblico radiotelevisivo sia inutile, superato e da cancellare **ne passa di strada!!**
Prova ne è il fatto che in Paesi più civili del nostro e con leggi e pratiche aziendali migliori, il servizio pubblico sia un gioiello per qualità e imparzialità.

Poi, per favore, non venirmi a fare la paternale col concetto di Internet perché sbiello proprio. Mi sono fatto le migliori litigate della mia vita con gente che non guarda la TV perché crede che siano tutte cazzate i e poi prende per messia Tankerenemy e Rosario Marcianò, che ti demoliscono i neuroni a forza di ""Vieni qui, la verità è solo qui, vedi, è tutto un complotto..."" oppure si ferma al blog di Beppe Grillo/inserisci qui una webstar che usa i *vaffanculo* a iosa.

Il web e pieno zeppo di merda, e per ogni sito di merda ci sono centinaia di gonzi che gravitano intorno. Se vuoi risolvere il problema dell'informazione azzerando il concetto di *servizio pubblico radiotelevisivo* e affidandoti solo al web e al dilettantismo, *prego*, accomodati.

To give you an example of a TV show that was intended for all audiences in all its versions, the popular TV show called The Office was originally a British-made series featuring Ricky Gervais.
The humor was dry and the outlook on the characters' lives rather cynical, even depressing at times.
The French made their own version of the show. In one of the first episodes, the Manager, played by our very own François Berléand, stumbles drunkenly out of a nightclub and pukes his heart off because he can't hold his liquor.

That's something you could have seen in Gervais' version, but definitely not in the American one, which is always light-hearted.

Ok, onto your statement about Spain becoming a post-socialist Eastern European country. It will not happen in our lifetime. The result of what's going on in Europe is going to be a tighter federation in the EU that more closely resembles the structure of the US, with the wealthier states like NY and California (or Germany in the EU) subsidize states like Alabama and Mississippi (or Greece in the EU). Many people don't get this because they are used to political unions coming before monetary ones and in this case it's the other way around. There are too many radical elements in Spanish society in particular that would prevent it from looking much like one of your post-socialist countries for very long. We have a long tradition of anarchism, syndicalism, and that's separate from the regional independence movements that would surely gain much steam if Spain as a whole were to decline. All of this adds up to civil unrest, riots even civil war-- which the EU would never allow on European soil. Germany will go broke trying to save all of Europe before the EU project is allowed to fail.

Once in power the reasonable thing (for a politician) to do is to further enhance this power. In this process, the restriction of the rights of the individual is a logical step. The occasional politician who wishes otherwise and manages to get in the necessary position is in dire disadvantage. If he restricts the power of his regime, he lessens his grip on the position.

There's no escaping it - the debt will have to be paid one way or the other and the solution is not to prolong the agony of the treatment or to avoid it but to push through the reforms, to liberalise the economy and to finally lift the massive tax burden so that it can flourish once and for all.",0,1371078250,null,0,false,0,cahoy46,t3_1g6y9p,t1_cahoy46,t1_cahon3h,null,1430830735,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The upside is that Gmail can't semantically analyze your mail to give you relevant ads, and just can't read your email at all, plain and simple. However, it will still be able to read messages sent to you, so like OP suggests, convincing your contacts to encrypt mail is ideal... but difficult.

Instant messaging is even more difficult, but there is a silver lining on the horizon!

&gt; EDIT: Out of curiosity, where do you stand on the leadership of GL?

Halsema was awesome. 

Sap seemed to lack charisma/passion which is quite important for a lijsttrekker since people react better to an emotional message than a rational one. The whole Kunduz debacle was unwinnable, tough politically it probably would have been wiser to err on the side of the pacifists. (Especially in hindsight.) The spring-deal seemed to have been handled well. After she left some rumors surfaced about her leadership style being quite authoritarian if this is true I say good riddance, authoritarianism is quite contrary to the spirit of GreenLeft.

The way the whole lijsttrekkers elections thing was managed by the party leadership (different from the lijsttrekkers who are solely political leaders) was shameful. Regardless of ones view of Tofik Dibi he is an accomplished and competent politician. Heck in 2010 he was nr 3 on the list, just behind Sap (Halsema on 1). Apparently a couple of other candidates were also rejected. The whole thing was idiotic, even CDA was handling their lijsttrekker elections more democratically. Anyway those responsible have stepped down and a lot of the outdated party mechanisms have been reformed. It probably won't happen again.

Don't know much about Bram van Oijk which shows he is doing his job well. He's simply supposed to mind the shop (he already said he probably won't be participating in the next lijsttrekker election) and have the party keep low profile for a while. During and after the lijsttrekker election debacle it seemed like the media was simply trying to kill off the party. So the plan is to lay low until the EU elections next year.

The current non-political party leader is Rik Grashof. I actually met the guy at the only local GreenLeft meeting I've attended so far, he's a nice guy I think the party is in good hands with him.

I'm hoping Jesse Klaver will be the next lijsttrekker, he seems to have plenty of the charisma and passion Sap lacked (and non of the nervous demeanor Dibi has).

I had a polish friend who arrived in italy at the same age as your cousin, and he got to my class. He knew shit about the language, but tried hard and passed through all the next 6 years (he joined me at the 3rd grade of middle a school, and we followed the next 5 in the same highschool). No bullying, no anything, nor from the teachers nor other students. He had a really shitty family situation, but he was smart and succeded.


My brother, born in Poland, on the other hand was smart, but failed school 3 times because of behaviour problems and not wanting to study etc. He was smart indeed, but as many kids he didn't want to apply in what he was doing. He dropped school and did a course on web design and he is actually working in that field. 

My hypotesis is: he's 15, and is telling you bullshit. It's a difficult age, in which is really easy to lie and blame all your problems on the world.
Try to check if he can join a professional school (cooking, tourism, mechanics), not everyone is supposed to succed in a good high school and then go to college (and I don't mean this as bad thing, I have few friend who have a succesful life after having done professional schools)",0,1371081274,null,0,false,0,cahq25f,t3_1g75w8,t1_cahq25f,t3_1g75w8,null,1430830139,13,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,13

What the heck, do you actually believe in this? That anyone could possibly more than double the amount of currency in circulation and not experience massive hyperinflation.

The Japanese have a very elderly population and as such have refrained from inflating their currency and have never engaged in anything that might resemble the expansionary monetary policy you're arguing for.

Not only would intelligence agencies be able to find out who you vote for, but that information would be open to hacks or leaks. This may not be a problem for you today, but it could be one in the future, and at that point it's too late to change it back. While the government itself may not use that information, the supporters of less democratically inclined groups could still harass you to change your vote.

True. I would suggest using a system like the one we use in Denmark today for state-to-person related stuff. It's fairly secure, but has of course proven to not be idiot proof.

&gt;90% of voters won't really care to vote on individual issues, though. A more fluid voting system would also make elections less important, possibly leading to a scenario where the majority of voters simply vote for someone and then never really reevaluate that choice. Forcing people to actively make a choice has a point. The fact that you can't change that choice for several years lends weight to that decision.

That is a valid point, and I think it would have to be confirmed. The very reason I think the idea of keeping representatives is so that people can let their vote go on passively until an issue they care about comes up. I do however think that voter engagement could be kept with a more fluid system, as you give a degree of power to the populace.

I would say the vote of the representative shows publicly to all the people he/she votes for. The good thing about online voting is that it can take days.

High life expectancy ≠ ""healthiest"".  Hunter-gatherers used to have great health but their life expectancy was low.  

But that's beside the point.  A country with such staggering poverty and privatized social services will soon see its life expectancy descend **due to declining health conditions.** 

Also, does your political crystal ball account for actual ground conditions?  Southern American states are not ""subsidized"".  They're rich in raw materials even if their general population are poor and ignorant as fuck.  That's not the case with the EU.  German banking has enjoyed very much speculating on Greek public and Spanish private debt, but when things get tough, Spain and Greece have nil, nothing, zero, zit to offer other than a migrating work force.  This is not a relationship like the one Louisiana has with New York, but more like Mexico with the U.S.

Last time I checked, Europe was very happy to permit the Nationalcatholic genocide in Spain.  Europe has a great tradition in turning the blind eye to carnage.

There are a lot of helpful post that I have read, and wanted to provide some useful info.  I have traveled a LOT throughout Europe and lived 3 years in eastern Europe as well.  
       First it is easy to travel cheaply in ways you may not have though of.  Airfare and trains are cheap!!!  Low as 30 euro round trip.  Unfortunately this is ""high"" season so everything is a lot more expensive.  I might recommend you see the rest of Europe by hopping to different regions by train/air and rent a car when you land.  Use www.skyscanner.com best site to source flight options.  Skyscanner allows you to search for flight for an entire month/year for the best price and Country wide!!!   I'm sure its the same in Spain but German rail has special cheap fares as low as 39 euros inter-country travel.  http://www.bahn.de/i/view/USA/en/prices/europe/europaspezial.shtml  Once you secure your large hops use http://www.autoeurope.com/ for discount Car rental.  Just like the Renault web site but cheaper.  Unlimited miles/Liability insurance and much cheaper.  Check it out.  This allows you too see more in less time and maybe you will not have to extend past your tourist Visa.  
      Secondly, though not recommended I have travel multiple times in western Europe without my passport.  There are no border stops in EU countries.  Even driving through Switzerland they only checked that I had the highway tariff and let me past TWICE.  NOT RECOMMENDED BUT...   no need to fear.  They are extremely friendly.  Be RESPECTFUL, NICE and accommodating and you should be fine.  
      I have visited about 2/3rd's of the European countries.  My recommendation.  
Music Festivals 
- Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands
Castles
- France, Germany, UK, Portugal
Panoramic Scenic Views

&gt;The idea of democratic justice system makes me a bit uneasy. I think justice should be about objective truth (or as objective as it can get) and democracy definitely isn't. Democracy already has a say in justice via the legislative process, they get to define what is and isn't illegal. Someone's guilt shouldn't be up for popular vote, it should be determined as objectively and rationally as possible.

Part of the reason for the jury system is that if you control the appointment of judges you can more easily appoint people willing to impose unjust convictions. Traditionally, also, most jurors couldn't vote in elections, so the only control over the law the people had was that they could refuse to convict (so the number of convictions for poaching, for example, used to be very low).",0,1371101259,null,0,false,0,cahx8tn,t3_1g75yh,t1_cahx8tn,t1_cahie1k,null,1430826681,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt; Gaining the interest of the jury would become a step in the judicial process in this case, I personally see the ""jury of peers"" as a democratization of the justice system.

I don't think it is. The whole reason we do not have jury of peers in German civil law is because human beings tend to a particular kind of emotional feeling of justice. 

We needed millenia to get to the point where our rule of law is strong enough to allow fair trial even for murderers, rapists, child-molesters and traitors. For most normal people, even an accusation of the above is a verdict - that's why juries are so dangerous, and that's why we require institutions to separate the emotional from the legal.

People who are trained in law are trained in doing exactly this. The psychological pitfalls and peer-pressure you get in the jury are far too dangerous, because they're far too easy influenced. I also do not believe that small group decisions are democratic. They can be, of course! But it only needs one person who seems to be more adamant about something, and the whole thing can swing to his or her side because everyone else is far too apathetic or not sufficiently loud to counter them.

If you doubt it, you've said it yourself: look what ""converging to the common demoniator"" does for mainstream media, then think of a jury packed with the people you usually deem stupid. 

That's not going to happen here in Germany, and I'm very thankful for it. And of course our system has its faults, but I feel safer in the hands of somebody who's job description is to find any illegal activity in what I did, due to purely professional reasons rather than emotional ones, and somebody who defends me in a similar manner.

Edit: Never forget where ""jury of his peers"" came from. It came from high-born (read: for their time well-educated) men being judging other (for their time educated) men.

Darüber hinaus war ERT (worum es hier geht) schon VOR der Krise die Sendeanstalt mit den GERINGSTEN Werbeeinnahmen im griechischen Werbemarkt.

Reali motivi per farne parte comprendono il ben noto art.5 dal punto di vista della difesa nazionale, il peso politico derivante dall'avere un ruolo e una voce in un contesto internazionale, la spinta economica legata all'industria bellica e non con tutte le sue sussidiarie.

Also, you say ""nach Düsseldorf"" when you want to say ""to (a place)"" if that place doesn't have an article (save phrases like ""nach Hause"" which are special). Here, I'll just correct what you wrote.

Ich werde **im** Sommer **nach** D **fliegen/reisen**. (word order for sentences is generally 'time' first, with the least specific time first, 'manner,' and then 'place' last. You also wrote ""I will"" and forgot the verb that describes what 'you will' actually do). Was **soll** ich tun, um mein Deutsch zu verbessern? (You don't really need 'sollte' here. Also, you should learn the phrase 'um, zu.' It means 'in order to' and you essentially write the first part of your sentence, for example: ""Ich schwimme jeden Tag"" and then add a comma to it followed by the 'um' (in order). Then, German sentence word order says we need to kick the infinitive version of the verb to the end of the sentence and then fill the space in between with whatever else is necessary for the sentence. For example, ""Ich schwimme jeden Tag, um fit zu bleiben."" (I swim every day to stay fit.)

**Mein** Deutsch ist nicht gut und **deswegen** werde ich **im** Sommer von 27. Juni bis 27. August **nach** D **fliegen/reisen**  (Adding 'deswegen' (because of this/thus) makes it sound more natural. It also forces you to switch the subject (ich) and the verb (werde) around). Was kann ein 17-jähriger am Nachmittag/Abend tun, **um** **sein** Deutsch **zu** üben? (the article for the language ""German"" is das, thus 'sein' and not 'seine.')

Ich glaube, ich werde **im** Düsseldorf-Stadtbezirk 04 **wohnen** (in der Nähe des Rheins). (I think 'wohnen' sounds better but 'bleiben' should work here as well. Also, I'm not totally sure if how you said the name of your city area is correct. If so then I think it still needs the 'im' instead of the 'in' because 'Bezirk' is what you're referring to and that word's article is 'der.' Because of the dative case, it becomes 'dem' and 'in + dem' = 'im.')

I may be wrong on a couple things but I'm sure a native could correct me.

If you want to see nice old architecture, Lübeck, which is about 80 km away from Kiel would be the best option. Don't miss the ""Holsten Tor""!
Speaking of Lübeck: Try the marzipan by Niederegger!

In Laboe, which is a lot closer to Kiel, you can visit the WW2 U Boot U995.

As mentioned by others here, Schleswig Holstein features nice beaches, lakes and landscapes. Interesting if you haven't seen a beach with strong tides before: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadden_Sea

If you can manage a trip to Hamburg, take a look at the Miniatur Wunderland: http://www.miniatur-wunderland.com/

Good places to eat in Kiel:
Tantamar (Thai &amp; Chinese Food)
Soho (Thai, Japanese &amp; Chinese Food)
Traum Gmbh (restaurant with great food, cinema and disco all in one)
Eisparadies (Kiel's best icecream, expect a 30 meter line in front of it on sunny days)

Per quello che ho imparato sullo human trafficiking, e per la mia idea di Stato, é un'ottima idea. Il giro d'affari della schiavitú é enorme, e noi, in quanto Italia, siamo fra i paesi sviluppati piú vicini a quel buco nero che sono i Balcani/Bulgaria/est estremo. Consierando la tendenza nazionale all'illegalitá e le nostre storiche mafie che inglobano facilmente questi racket, taglieresti le gambe ad un business, e non é male. D'altro canto, non é detto che le nostre mafie non si inseriscano in quel business nella loro maniera ""legale"". Peró rimane che eviteremmo minorenni, pestaggi, forse anche stupri. Non so quanto eviteremmo la schiavitú per la questione ""fiducia nelle autoritá vs potere"". Se sono sola al mondo, parlo male la lingua, devo denunciare alle autoritá che vengono a fare i controlli che sono stata messa lí contro la mia volontá. Dove mi portano dopo?Riescono a proteggermi davvero?Se non mi fido, non denunceró comunque. E se vengo da un paese dove sono abituata a vedere poliziotti mazzettati che fanno i bodyguards dei boss, non denunceró mai.

Da donna, o meglio, come da persona umana, non saprei. Davvero ritengo ""sano"" che esista questo ""sfogo"" nella mia societá per l'uomo?Cosa intendo quando dico che ""l'uomo ne ha bisogno""? Che é probabile che non trovi un modo normale di ottenere del sesso?Che allora é ok che lo compri?Non saprei. E' come dire che siccome uomini e donne hanno difficoltá a capirsi, e l'uomo sarebbe una specie di ""bestia"" che se non soddisfa i suoi bisogni diventa pericoloso, bisogna per forza trovargli una valvola di sfogo, possibilmente legale. E che questo sarebbe un bisogno sociale. Davvero quello di cui ha bisogno é, scusate la brutalitá, solo un ""buco?

Non ha forse bisogno di contatto umano, di empatia, di calore, come tutti gli esseri umani? Non sono proprio certa che questa zompata a pagamento con una che OVVIAMENTE non ti vuole, non sta sentendo nulla e molto raramente si ""connetterá"" con te ad alcun livello possa essere abbastanza per un uomo. Cioé, a quel punto forse é pure meglio la masturbazione. Poi ovvio, non sono un uomo. Molti hanno provato a farmi credere che il mero atto sessuale sia abbastanza per fargli sentire quel calore, a prescindere dalla circostanza. Peró boh, nessuna delle persone che conosco crede a questa versione della storia. O c'é una ""scintilla"", un desiderio, una connessione anche passeggera fra i due che finiscono a letto, o potrebbe risultare un po' umiliante.

Davvero, non saprei. Non so voi, ma il mio ragazzo, i miei amici, non mi sembrano bestie. Se non ottengono del sesso per un po' diventeranno nervosetti, ma non mi sembrano pericolosi :) Ció che intendo dire é che forse una sana educazione alla sessualitá fa molto di piú delle case chiuse per questo supposto ""bisogno"". Il sesso si fa in due, no? Imparare a dare e a darsi, senza sensi di colpa, senza usare il sesso come aram, etc...

Les logiciels libres sont, souvent, le fruit du travail d'individus ou de groupes d'individus qui vont se regrouper autour d'une mailing liste, d'un forum, d'un site web, d'une association ou même d'une fondation (par taille croissante) ou autre structure à but non-lucratif. Cela est vrai pour une majorité des logiciels libres, je pense.

Certaines sociétés vont, par la suite, développer une activité commerciale de service autour de tels logiciels : support, intégration, aide à la transition, ... C'est ce que fait RedHat, ainsi que de nombreuses sociétés de taille moyenne. Dans cette activité, ils vont parfois être amenés à répondre à des besoins non satisfaits par un logiciel existant, et vont donc y développer une réponse, et ainsi contribuer au logiciel.

C'est comme cela que RedHat s'est mis à contribuer à Linux et a développé de nombreux outils de grande qualité. En fait, la majorité des contributions aux logiciels libres est effectuée par des entreprises (ou plutôt par des personnes travaillant pour le compte d'une entreprise).

Well we know what politician did what en where they live, it's more accountable than someone anonymous. There are things like public corruption scandals (just try to find conflicts of interest of an anonymous parliament), votes of no confidence, politicians/cabinets that step down, constituents to keep satisfied, voters that can walk away, investigative journalism that keeps tabs on what's what, opposition that scrutinizes everything you do, etc. Try to do that when the public can't even know who is in charge.

And the system is really vulnerable, it would just take a little corruption/blackmail of those responsible for the assignment of the anonymous parliament and you've got yourself an anonymous dictator.

On the [2012 Corruption Perceptions Index](http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/results/) Netherland scores 84 (9th least corrupt in the world) and Romania 44 (66th least corrupt in the world). So perhaps your idea of an anonymous parliament would indeed be an improvement in Romania, I however don't think it would be here in the Netherlands.

If you receive accomodation worth $14,500/year as part of your salary, you have to pay tax on it. Basically, everything that's part of your salary is taxable income. Not really different from how fringe benefits are taxed in the US (including company provided housing). They'll go to great lengths to make up a value if it's not obvious. 

The fact that they charge you for housing instead of making you look for accomodations yourself also doesn't sound fishy to me as it can be quite hard to find something when you're not already in Germany. If you're only staying for half a year then I'd say your chances to find something reasonably quickly would be pretty slim almost everywhere.

If they didn't make it clear that this was going to be the way it's going to work, that might be a bit dodgy, but either way your numbers don't really sound like they're ripping you off.

Your taxes depend on a lot of things, but a monthly deduction of $3200 for a $126k/year salary is pretty much what I'd expect for a single person, not married, and so on.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;However, they have recently reversed course and are printing trillions of yens (see abenomics). 

Still nothing when compared to what the US is doing, proof of that is the [JPY/USD exchange rate](http://i.imgur.com/zk4tO74.png), it's now at 94.09 yen to the dollar, it's still much stronger than it was in the past.

Oh, and from what I hear from US news, they do are experiencing quite some inflation, it's just not being picked up by their CPI because, as I mentioned, food and gas aren't included and that's where plenty of people spend most of their money, and these prices are rising some 8% to 10%/year.

&gt;We would be printing Euros not Escudos

Good luck in convincing the rest of Europe to do that. I think that's a lost cause, a lot of the population is elderly and wants no part in losing a substantial amount of their savings because we were out building roads.

&gt;we're not on the gold standard.

Nor could we be if we ever wanted to inflate the currency, that's the whole point of the gold standard, you can't print money unless the central bank as the gold for it in its vaults.

&gt;I don't really expect much inflation since most of the Euros will be used to pay down debt and we have a huge amount of unused productive capacity.

Inflation happens regardless of where you spend the money on. If the amount of money in circulation increases more than the GDP, then you'll experience inflation. 

Even if you paid the debt only till 60% of GDP in the Eurozone (now at 91%), you'd have to pump 2792 billion euros into the economy as the current M2 for the euro is of 9008 billion euros! Going even further, if the debt were to be zeroed through monetary means, you'd have to print 8197 billion euros!

This if the government bonds weren't adjusted for inflation and if the ECB wasn't explicitly forbidden of monetising debt and didn't have the main goal of keeping price stability and if governments were allowed to to ask the ECB to monetise their debts and the central bank wasn't also forbidden to buy and sell directly to governments.

Anyway, this to say that it's simply not an option and that it would be crazy to think it's an alternative.

&gt;Research also seems to indicate that printing alone is not enough to trigger hyperinflation you also need an institutional collapse

No, it does not. It's actually quite the reverse, hyperinflation is what triggers the institutional collapse.

&gt;the level of which is pretty much impossible in Europe. 

Just then you were saying we were going to collapse and the riots would start a bit like Turkey atm.

&gt;We don't have much left to privatize. All that's left to privatize are things that mostly shouldn't be private.

We still have plenty to privatise. Considering the news in Greece, yeah, RTP should go as well.

&gt;Even with that, it will not be enough to pay our debt.

Of course it won't, that's why I'm for simply keeping the debt under control once it goes under the 100% to GDP threshold and then focus on growth as opposed to budget cuts - that is to say, we'll need to continue cutting a lot though taxes should be slashed as well, if we keep the budget balanced even at that level of debt, a liberalised economy with tax reductions would allow us to outgrow the debt.",0,1371120661,null,0,false,0,cai0krs,t3_1g6y9p,t1_cai0krs,t1_cahqqgc,null,1430825111,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Dopo che hai visto questo filmato gratis, sul monitor appare automaticamente il genere di donna che hai visto. Abita vicino a te, nella tua città e se vuoi si collega con te immediatamente. Lei è in casa sua che ti guarda con una webcam e tu guardi lei. Se vuoi parlarle clicchi, fai conoscenza e ti metti d’accordo per una prestazione. In questo modo il rapporto è diretto, non c’è più il magnaccia, lo sfruttatore, e non vai più per strada. La rete toglie tutte le intermediazioni, toglie anche le donne o gli uomini dalla strada. Vuol dire che tu fai pornografia in proprio, tu direttamente, ti metti in rete e ti pagano. Se non vuoi pagare la prestazione ti fai filmare in una scena sessuale con un quadratino nero sul volto così non ti si riconosce. Ti filmano e mettono il filmato sul sito, e tu non paghi niente, è tutto gratis. Insomma sesso a chilometro zero.

Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny.

Do you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them.

&gt;Gheg (or Geg) is one of the two major varieties of Albanian language. The other one is Tosk, on which standard Albanian is based. [...] Gheg is spoken in Northern Albania, Kosovo, northwestern Republic of Macedonia, southern Montenegro and Serbia. [...] Gheg does not have any official status as a written language in any country. Publications in Kosovo and Macedonia are in standard Albanian, which is based on Tosk.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Geg

&gt;Southern Gheg is one of the two dialects of Gheg Albanian, along with Northern Gheg. Southern Gheg is the Gheg dialect with the least differences from Tosk. It can be divided further into Central Gheg, which is the dialect spoken by the majority of the Albanians in Macedonia, and Middle Gheg, which is spoken in the central regions of Albania including the country's capital, Tiranë.

Not really. I am against their practices obviously but their form of governing is as much of a threat to us as any Arab/African regime's governing.

However if we are to embargo them for their anti-democratic governing then good-luck with also boycotting middle eastern oil and soon maybe also Russian fuel.

À un moment, ça ne tient plus et on aboutit à une crise.

Évidemment, les États sont complices, puisqu'ils bénéficient des puissances d'argent (propagande médiatique, soutien militaire, soutien financier).

On maintient ainsi une situation où l'on préserve les inégalités en faveur de quelques oligarques, et au détriment du peuple, qui est censé être souverain.

If the government officials know that the people are too lazy and/or indifferent to do protest, they will continue to make poor decisions and going against public opinion.



Case in point, Romania. We don't give a shit about anything. The state post office is bankrupt because of the politically appointed managers that made faulty contracts with dubious firms and now they decided that they're gonna lay off a couple of thousands of people and try and privative it. 

How did people react? They didn't.

Only the post office workers protested for a few days, they didn't work for a few days and than the mighty syndicate negotiated with the government and the managed to get them to only fire ~2k people instead of ~4k. 

After those few days, things were back to normal. Like nothing happened. 


But some positive actions were taken in the beginning of 2012 when they wanted to do some sort of health reform that practically meant the privatization of health care, and culminated with Raed Arafat being fired from the health ministry position because he opposed that reform.

Translation(my own, im a swede): Today animal-protection laws includes abuse that means/results in the animal suffering physical or psychological damage, which can be hard to prove.

That would mean cases like the dog i mentioned would be included in that law. The new law however would include the horse as well, though (arguably) it would not have suffered. In my opinion this makes the law based on opinion of morals rather than anything concrete and if you can't base a law on something other than ""i don't like this"", then it probably shouldn't be a law.

I could see two arguments for it, animals having rights and animals not liking it. Animals having rights i think is a funny argument to use here, the animal abuse law already being in place, the only harm we could do is no worse than what animals are being exposed to when raised for the purpose of bacon. I mean, there's a disconnection there, we can't say we're respecting animals rights when we're raising them for food and generally treating them as, well, livestock. As for animals not liking it, psychological/mental abuse is included in laws already i place, other than that, i'm sure they don't like being eaten either.

Several Greek Redditors see reality through their ideological prisms, and are *always* sensationalizing and misrepresenting what happens in Greece. Sorry, guys, a society of 11 million people is not the same as a group of a few armchair slacktivists or a few thousands of people demonstrating for whatever valid or invalid cause.

Get out and talk to real people, of all ages, with different upbringings and professions. The majority of them do not give a fuck about ERT. Yes, ERT had some good shows, but that's it. Nothing more. Making it sound like there were Nazis bombing Athens is ridiculous.

Let's take baby steps.

ERT was bloated. That leaves us with one option: to fire people. Firing people leaves us with two options: keep the company open, or start with a new company. If the government kept the company open, then the absurdly paid holy cows known as unionists would start a strike. What the fuck would happen then? Nothing at all. What happened is ugly, but it's necessary. Where the fuck were you when other people said about excess spending in the past? How the hell you suddenly became so obsessed with a broadcaster which *you* said was only good for government propaganda?

Do not think that you're more sensitive than me or other people because you think that you support whatever ideology. What you do is insulting for the people that work with low wages in ERT. The people making a big fuss now are not these working class people. The holy cows use the working class people in order to keep their privileges.

Grow up and don't think in black or white. Stop badmouthing this country. It's not only yours and it will move forward, either you like it or not.

*Before* the crisis, however, Greece used to have Europe's biggest military spending by far, in terms of share of its GDP. And much of that spending went into buying foreign hardware, since Greece doesn't build that many weapons itself.

Why did Greece sink so much money into its military? I can think of two reasons:

1) Turkey. In case you haven't noticed, these two NATO ""allies"" are continously watching each other, with the occasional incident over the Aegean: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_dispute

2) Corruption. Because of military secrecy, corrupt politicians *love* large weapons contracts, which often leave money all over the place.

&gt; I am pretty sure that the close down was legally sound and I am equally sure that the EU would raise the topic, if the Greek government overstepped its constitutional powers or behaved otherwise unlawful. Like the Commission did in Austria, Hungry, and other countries at some point.

So, your only source of what follows proper democratic processes is the EU, an appeal to authority? If the EU says something is okay then it is? Nevertheless, it is very likely that the EU will sooner or later have a say on the matter and it is not at all obvious that it is going to be supportive of the government. 

But let's look at the facts: The major coalition partner of the government issued an emergency decree (the constitution allows issuing these kinds of decrees in case of a national emergency e.g. natural disasters, wars etc) that gave the power to any minister to shut down any public service/company in their jurisdiction.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"Lobbying is simply about telling your view to the politician.. preferably repeatedly and in several ways. There's nothing sinister about it -- the fact is that a politician is not a master of all walks of life and would otherwise do stupid decisions out of ignorance. Yes, they get briefed by people from bureau (see: *Yes, Minister*), but they might also have agendas or ignore certain viewpoints for convenience.  So, for example, some librarian might lobby the city council for a bigger budget by explaining the importance of library to the community (which the alderman might not bring readily up, only telling how much closing library would ease the money problems).

The idea is that all parties will have their say and then the politician can decide without unknowingly trampling any rights. This is the basic level. 

Then when stuff is far from where you actually live, you can't actually go to talk to the politician yourself (like you can on city council level, as the politicians are farther from you and they have more votes to think of - be it national politicians in Stockholm or Bryssels), and instead you start writing letters (thats lobbying too!) or you form an association who hires a lobbyist (which is what EFF is in USA and EDRi is in EU). Still pretty above ground. Some companies hire lobbyists as well, as they have interests as well. As long as all parties get their time, things are well.

It starts to stink of corruption when the lobbyist pays for the politician either to listen to him (like treating him to an expensive dinner while explaining his point of view) or offering cash-backs (or other favours, such as a job after the term ends) in favour of the right vote. 

Another problem is that the politician might not think citizen-organisation lobbyists may not be sen as legitimate when corporate interests' lobbyist is seen as one (for example, the politician accepts Shell's lobbyist but not Greenpeace's). But if the lobbyists deal fairly, the politician understands she must be evenhanded etc., then the arrangement is a great way to keep the politician in his glass tower connected to the people at the ground level.

Disclosure; I'm a member of several citizen associations that lobbies the national government for better legislation and/or money for certain projects. I've also held some very low-level county-positions after getting the minimum number of votes from town population (we're talking about tens of votes). Mostly the ""lobbying"" talks were similar to what you can imagine talking to Jehova's Wittnesses is like.

This is authoritarian. Not liberal, not conservative liberal, not communist, not socialist, simply authoritarian. You either realise that and you choose not to care, or you don't realise it in which case I am truly sorry.

Nobody, **nobody**, *nobody* supports that ERT shouldn't be reformed and shrunk. Not even ERT employees themselves. But shutting it down in one day is simply authoritarian.

Recent ERT strikes about cuts, which were triggered by unionists affiliated with SYRIZA and KKE, are not any indication that ERT is somehow fixed. If you want to be on the lookout for your common fallacies, start with this one. Leftist injections in ERT reduce the influence of the gonerment, therefore everything is better now. No, it's not fucking OK. No party should have any influence in ERT. No dynamic minorities should abuse the public's right to have a public broadcaster that runs 24/7. I'm not going to enter into further debate about things that are so elementary.

ERT is being _replaced_ by another public organization, not being shut down altogether, so it looks like Greece will have to survive without public television for a few months.  
  
As is typical in Greece, most of the people working there will almost certainly be hired by the new organization, while others will find their way to some other public sector job.  Some people will indeed lose their jobs for good, but how is this news in a country with already over 1 million unemployed?  
  
The execution of the whole plan was deliberately flashy, because the prime minister wants it to look to the Troika like he is really in charge of the situation.  
  
ERT was indeed one of the most corrupt public organizations, where politicians (including those in government today) used to give away high-paying sinecure jobs to their most loyal voters at the expense of taxpayers and the people who _really_ kept ERT going all these years.  Every attempt for reform in the past was fiercely opposed by said politicians, trade unions and all people who had a vested interest in the situation.  It was an obviously unsustainable situation, and when it collapsed, the consequences affected honest and dishonest personnel alike (as usual).

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil%E2%80%93United_States_cotton_dispute) is another nice example of such a situation. Brazil and certain African nations get profit out of producing cotton. African/Brazilian cotton is cheaper and the US amongst others can't compete. Following the ""principle of free trade"" your minister mentioned. That would be it. 

Africa can produce cotton cheaper due to low wages and adequate environment then so be it. 

However the American cotton industry lobbies for government subsidies and receives such. The result is the market getting overloaded with cheap severely under-prized American cotton and the African nations and Brazil see their prices drop. Brazil complains at the WTO and yabayabayaba...

Us trying to protect our markets by blocking out under-prized Chinese goods is just as unfair as the Chinese government pumping billions in that industry. 

Our alternatives would be to either let our own solar panel industry die out or to start a race to the bottom in a big tradewar where we pump billions in the steal, solarpanel, whatever industry.

edit: This very similar to many peoples position on banks that have to be saved. Nobody likes the gov dumping taxmoney in banks that made risky high profit gambels. Proper capitalism would be to just let them die out. The problem is that people like the high tarifs that most of those banks can give on their accounts and letting everyone suddenly loose their money isn't exactly good for the economy either

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; Sorry, guys, a society of 11 million people is not the same as a group of a few armchair slacktivists or a few thousands of people demonstrating for whatever valid or invalid cause.

That's not true. In democratic countries, the majority is not allowed to tyrannise the minority. Just because you have a majority you can't tell everyone who disagrees with you to shut up. Besides, you don't even have a majority. The decision was made unilaterally by the major coalition partner without the rest agreeing with it. 

&gt; Get out and talk to real people, of all ages, with different upbringings and professions. The majority of them do not give a fuck about ERT. Yes, ERT had some good shows, but that's it. Nothing more. Making it sound like there were Nazis bombing Athens is ridiculous.

Who appointed you a representative of all people from all walks in life? Bring me data that support this claim. Besides, as I said above, minorities do have rights too. Even if the majority of people don't care about ERT, that doesn't mean that the government can do whatever they want with it. Look at the recent uprising in Turkey. Does the majority of Turkish population care if that park is turned into a mall? 

&gt; ERT was bloated. 

That is debatable. It did have a surplus and it only costs the taxpayer 3 euros per month. 

&gt; That leaves us with one option: to fire people.

That's not true either. They could lower wages (which they have already done, that's why they have a surplus) they could use fewer external contractors etc. 

&gt; If the government kept the company open, then the absurdly paid holy cows known as unionists would start a strike.

Union bashing, of course. All unions are evil bla bla bla. Thatcher would be proud of you but I don't think anyone buys the story that unions are automatically corrupt organisations who say no to everything. 

&gt; What happened is ugly, but it's necessary.

Overriding democratic procedures is ugly, but necessary? Really? You are going down a dangerous path here. 

&gt; Where the fuck were you when other people said about excess spending in the past? How the hell you suddenly became so obsessed with a broadcaster which you said was only good for government propaganda?

I was here and I agreed that the excesses need to stop. But, as you say, not everything is black and white. I can disagree with the excesses and I can also disagree with the authoritarian way the government is handling this. The public broadcaster was indeed used for government propaganda but right now it's the most free broadcaster in Greece. 

If anything, I don't care that much about people getting fired and all that stuff. But I do care and hope that ERT remains as open, free and independent in the future as it is right now.

&gt; What you do is insulting for the people that work with low wages in ERT. The people making a big fuss now are not these working class people.

So, you are saying the ERT broadcast right now is done without the help of these working class people? That the ""holy cows"" are running the station by themselves, without the help of technicians and other low-payed workers? Don't be absurd. These people are also there helping.

&gt; Grow up and don't think in black or white. Stop badmouthing this country. It's not only yours and it will move forward, either you like it or not.

This is especially offensive. You are the one who is seeing this as black and white. You say ""ERT had problems therefore I support any government decision against it"".

The first floor is where your restaurant is, second has a gift shop and cafe, and is also where you can purchase lift tickets to get to the top! They definitely do this because there are a lot of people who take the stairs (which you can only do to get to the 2nd floor) or only buy lift tickets to get to the second floor, like you!) and they can make an extra buck/people don't realize which ticket's they've purchased, and still want to go to the top.

Sounds good to me. The solar panel industry is a race to the bottom anyway. Once they get there, then it becomes interesting to enter.

Although I often agree with them on many aspects, I have three major issues with the Linke:

1 When they are in the minority, they mostly do ""Fundamentalopposition"", meaning they oppose whatever the majority does and make legislation drafts that are impossible for other parties to join in on. I don't like this idea very much because it leads to them never actually doing anything to further their agenda. I can only imagine this is for ideological reasons. This is mostly true for the west though, I think in the east they are more pragmatic.

2 I fear their ideology is terribly outdated.. They see most of the symptoms I see, but I think we differ on both cause and remedy

3 Despite the official position, many of these people still dearly miss their DDR, at least in the east. And I think they know that this perception exist in many people in the west.

The same goes for other products and I already mentioned that. The US has to pay Brazil a yearly fine. They had to drop their import tarrifs against chinese steel in 2004 under EU pressure and so on. It's why organisations like the WTO exist.

&gt;Sounds good to me. The solar panel industry is a race to the bottom anyway. Once they get there, then it becomes interesting to enter

...What? Please tell me how would that go?

They're just as fair, unbiased and accountable as the state-owned ones with one major advantage: they're not an expense for the taxpayers.

Or you think that RTP is great and totally worth all its expense whereas SIC or TVI which are privately-owned are awful and should be nationalised?

&gt;Corrupt and unaccountable governments and laws are not a signal to privatize, it's a signal that the people need to intervene and change the system.

Except corrupt and unaccountability is part of the system, you can't someone all the power like you do with politicians, say ""use it wisely"" and then complain when they use it for their own purpose.

That's precisely why privatisation is necessary - if you want to stay in business, you must provide a good service and you must have costumers. You just can't justify all the spending in RTP when SIC and TVI offer the exact same service at no expense to the taxpayer.

&gt;Most corruption exists because a politician is willing to take dirty money and a private company is willing to pay him.

And because that politician is allowed to exercise his influence in the marketplace. Get the government out of the business of running the economy and there will be no incentives for people to bribe politicians for this or that as the rules will be the same for everybody.

It's no accident that the more the government regulates and tries to run the economy, the more room there is for corruption.

And if we all hold our hands and sing Kumbaya we'll live peacefully ever after.

Tu sais, ici, y a que toi qui prend ce slongan pour un programme politique abouti et exhaustif. Un slogan est un slogan, une phrase choc. C'est pas un argument, c'est un résumé d'une pensée. 

&gt; et puis désolé mais y a environ 12 morts/jour sur les routes et dans 90% des cas c'est la faute des gens concernés; je vois pas le rapport avec le terrorisme et son nombre de morts.

La moitié des morts de la route ne sont pas des conducteurs. Et pas mal de conducteurs sont tués par d'autres. T'as 6 innocents par jour tués sur les routes de France. Combien par de méchants terroristes ? Et combien de terroristes ont été découragés par la video-surveillance et les militaires armés de FAMAS dans les gares ?

&gt; Si je puis me permettre, je préfère voter pour un gouvernement qui au moins essaye de faire quelque chose contre les attaques à la bombe plutôt qu'un mec comme toi dont la conclusion semble être ""osef"".

Je préfère faire quelque chose contre un gouvernement qui fait quelque chose plutôt que contre un gouvernement qui prétend essayer, mais supprime la police aux endroits justement chauds, saque le ministère des affaires étrangères qui a un rôle essentiel là dedans, stigmatise la population musulmane en lui offrant des raisons de résister par la violence.

Et ça, si un slogan ne te suffit pas, je peux le développer sur 12 pages si tu veux. Sarko a créé du terrorisme et a rendu déplorable la sécurité des Français à l'étranger. Il a rompu avec la politique de ne pas verser de rançons aux preneurs d'otages, et maintenant un Français ne peut plus se balader à moins de 1000 kilomètres d'une zone chaude car il y a une étiquette indiquant ""10 millions d'euros"" au dessus de sa tête.",0,1371140722,null,0,false,0,cai5z5i,t3_1g74rt,t1_cai5z5i,t1_cai4a4v,null,1430822495,0,false,france,t5_2qhjz,0

Turkey is another story, since Greece feels a need to be on par with Turkey's military in the Aegean.

BBC begs to differ.

&gt;Or you think that RTP is great and totally worth all its expense whereas SIC or TVI which are privately-owned are awful and should be nationalised?

Fortunately I don't think in black and white, maybe you should too.

&gt;Except corrupt and unaccountability is part of the system, you can't someone all the power like you do with politicians, say ""use it wisely"" and then complain when they use it for their own purpose.

Let's give that power to private companies, I'm sure they all have the society well being at their most higher priority.

&gt;That's precisely why privatisation is necessary - if you want to stay in business, you must provide a good service and you must have costumers. You just can't justify all the spending in RTP when SIC and TVI offer the exact same service at no expense to the taxpayer.

No, the problem is not the owner but the way it is run.

&gt;And because that politician is allowed to exercise his influence in the marketplace. Get the government out of the business of running the economy and there will be no incentives for people to bribe politicians for this or that as the rules will be the same for everybody.

&gt;It's no accident that the more the government regulates and tries to run the economy, the more room there is for corruption.

I will quote myself from the previous post:

Corrupt and unaccountable governments and laws are not a signal to privatize, it's a signal that the people need to intervene and change the system.


&gt;if you deal with the root of the problem that is government being allowed to give special benefits to certain groups then you'll remove the incentives to such corruption.

Je ne suis pas socialiste, je suis nationaliste. Ces exemples ne m'intéressent pas et ne sont pas un argument pour moi.

&gt;inégalités sont une mauvaise chose intrinsèquement

Les droits ne valent que si l'on a la possibilité de les faire valoir. Ainsi, si on est trop pauvre pour se déplacer (avoir une voiture, payer ses titres de transports...), la liberté de déplacement ne sert à rien.

Si l'on a les mêmes droits, mais que le déterminisme social (reproduction des élites et concentration des richesses) empêche leur réalisation pour la majorité, on n'est plus dans une situation de liberté. Ainsi, aux États-Unis, un pauvre n'est pas libre de faire les mêmes études qu'un riche.

&gt;Singapour

6% du PIB pour la défense, 2 ans de service militaire obligatoire, même famille au pouvoir depuis l'indépendance, pas de liberté politique, grèves interdites, censure. 111% de dette/PIB ... Bel exemple.

14,7% de taux de pauvreté... en France, c'est 8%. [Intervention militaire au Timor oriental](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Astute). Intégration des aborigènes. Et cela malgré les immenses ressources minières exploitées au mépris de tout respect de l'environnement.

Et tout comme la Nouvelle Zélande : contrôle de la monnaie et des taxes à la frontière (très basses en ce moment, mais qui ont été très hautes jusqu'en 1991 au moins).

Service militaire ou pénalités et armée de réserve. Contrôle de la monnaie et des taxes à la frontière. **Mais oui, du libéralisme comme ça en France, ça me conviendrait parfaitement.** À part bien sûr le secret bancaire et le blanchiment d'argent. La Suisse est pour moi un modèle à suivre sur bien des points (en particulier, le service militaire, l'armée de réserve, l'absence de droit du sol et les restrictions à l'immigration).

Effectivement, ce sont des pays où la dette est faible (par les US,  le Royaume-Uni, le Canada, l'Irlande, l'Allemagne, l'Autriche, le Japon, et Singapour sont assez endettés et ont une bonne note de liberté économique). Et pour l'intervention militaire, j'aurais dû dire ""importance de l'armée"".

In case a foreigner believes that this is the case, it most definitely isn't. A majority of the employees in ERT were hired by ""knowing a politician"". Or by a ""manager installed by the government"" (read: a unionist). They were more like supportive of them, instead of manipulated by them.

You can see that from the fact that when the government attempted to write down what contractors ert uses, how many hours and ""long hours"" they work (a common trick in the greek public sector was to claim you work extra hours even if you didn't, usually doubling your salary), what equipment/facilities ert really owns (they didn't want people to know that because, extra contracts), then not just the managers and the politicians but the whole ert in unison blocked it. 

If they don't want to be audited at all then there's something wrong. And as you said it seems that many in ert (probably those with technical skills that know they'll be needed) would rather go with a complete restructuring to get rid of the ""managers imposed by the government"". The other option seems to be an excuse for them and their cliques to stay.

They'll obviously need to put back a public television in a few months, keeping some of the old personel, hiring some young people, and getting rid of the corrupt, and the corruption channels that had been esteblished.

So I'm not going to worry about them closing ert yet, it depends on what will happen in October (it is very likely that the government will once again only hire people voting ND/Pasok or upper middle class people they owe favours to).

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;BBC begs to differ.

BBC is funded with taxpayers money and they also have plenty of privately owned stations such as ITV or Channel Four how do the exact same thing. 

While the UK are rich enough to have a state-owned tv station, we'd be much better off without RTP in the hands of the state. It's not the role of the state to run tv stations.

&gt;Fortunately I don't think in black and white, maybe you should too.

Do you or do you not support the debt that RTP imposed on us all. If you think it's worth it, great, let's privatise it so that you can buy its shares and everything, don't foot the bill to the rest of the Portuguese taxpayers.

&gt;Let's give that power to private companies, I'm sure they all have the society well being at their most higher priority.

No, they have profit in mind. Which I'm fine with, governments also don't have our well-being in mind and, again, companies in a free market can only profit if they make a good service and have costumers whereas governments can do all the insane shit and be incredibly corrupted and it's always the taxpayers that have to pay, the state never goes bankrupt, only its citizens.

So yeah, get the state out of the business and let people for profit run things, if they fuck up it will come out of their pocket, it's much better than now where when the government fucks up you have to just deal with it.

&gt;No, the problem is not the owner but the way it is run.

If [this](http://www1.ionline.pt/conteudo/106729-conheca-os-salarios-milionarios-na-rtp) happens in RTP, you pay for it. If it happens in SIC or TVI, they pay for it. Isn't this more than enough reason to privatise? Are you really that deluded and think that there's some D. Sebastião out there that will get into power by being virtuous and not corrupt and that will manage everything perfectly for the good of the people and not take advantage of the powers given to him by his position?

&gt;Guess you never heard of a cartel or the impacts of the banking sector deregulation

Which are only an issue when the state continues to play a role. Cartels wouldn't exist if there were no licensing and registration and tons of bureaucracy, the second the companies started to raise prices, more would enter the market and lower them. As for banks, blame the government for not having a decent judicial system and for bailing them out.

&gt;I'm quite sure that that will happen for many millennia right after the founding of your totally feasible minarchist state.

I can't recall the last time a country such as Switzerland or New Zealand got itself in conflicts. It might just be a coincidence but yeah, their intervention in the economy is minimal.

&gt;Corrupt and unaccountable governments and laws are not a signal to privatize, it's a signal that the people need to intervene and change the system.

And I'll rephrase myself what I said in the other post:

Keep dreaming. That's never going to happen as it's human nature for people to pursue their self-interest, power corrupts and any system like the state which is run not on voluntary exchange but on taxation is doomed to fail as politicians will eventually only care for themselves and use their tools not to further society but to further themselves.

&gt;Once again, your solution is giving a free pass card to corporations and wealthy individuals. It's working great in the US btw.

Yeah, the US, a country with so many arbitrary restrictions in their economy and where big government sides with big business to keep competition out, truly a free market.

lol, you want to know what I'm advocating, look at Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore and stop with the straw man.

&gt;Governments aren't going anywhere, someone is needed to manage a country, write the laws and apply them.

Fully agreed. Which is why they should focus on that and not on running the tv station.

&gt;We just need to elect non corrupt officials.

Back to earth. You could pick the most virtuous person on the planet, put him in power here and he'd be filling his pockets and his friends pockets 4 years in.

&gt;I know it's an almost impossible task in Portugal, but it's what we should do and in case of failure, initiate a Portuguese Spring. Others can do it, why can't we?

And achieve what, exactly? The exact same thing where the faces change and the system remains the same, corrupt as the incentives are the same and people are still naive enough to trust that one day they'll pick the right person even though it has been decades of this?

If you want to change the system, this is what you have to do:

And state-owned stations are also not good, they listen to what the politicians in charge tell them, not to the interests of society. Case in point: this Greek TV station paid its executives some 100.000€/year.

&gt;That's the reason all developed countries have a public broadcaster

That doesn't mean it's a good policy, plenty of developed countries also have trade barriers or don't allow homosexuals to adopt and yet these things are bad and not good for society.

&gt;But it is equally important that the public broadcaster is not stuffed with corrupt management that got their jobs as political favours.

That or private citizens like you and be could buy shares and own part of them and as customers we could only watch the stations we find interesting meaning that it's in the best interest of the privately-owned broadcasting stations to offer a good unbiased service otherwise they'll lose business.

Un dittatorello isterico e' un dittatorello isterico. Fascista o comunista non conta nulla. La faccia del peggior populismo e' sempre quella: 

1- individuare 'il nemico': gli Ebrei, i dissidenti,  le multinazionali delle vaccinazioni, 'i politici', l'Euro; iniziare una campagna di denigrazione e disumanizzazione (zombie, morti, tombe maledeoranti). Se va bene, poi qualcuno ci crede e mette mano alle molotov, o peggio.

2- Proporre 'soluzioni' facili e indolori a tutti i problemi (vedi 'uomo della provvidenza'). L'economia va male? Confischiamo i soldi 'ai politici' (Stalin usava i borghesi). Usciamo dall'euro (Benito sponsorizzava l'Autarchia), buttiamoci sulla decrescita felice per tutti (rivoluzione culturale di Mao) e via. 

3- Schiacciare il dissenso e la discussione, e affermare il culto della personalita': 'uno vale niente'.

Alabama receives more than 2x the federal tax revenues it pays out.

I don't want to pick out every little thing point for point but some of the other things you said are not true either:

&gt;Hunter-gatherers used to have great health but their life expectancy was low.

Life expectancy is an *average*. When you read anthropology textbooks about hunter gatherers and their ~37 year life expectancy, that doesn't mean people are dropping like flies before 40. It's because of the high rate of infant mortality. If you made it past 30 you had a chance of making it to 60 and beyond, even 30,000 years ago. There's fossil records of people that old, and we can guess their age approximately by how worn down their molars are.

Disagree. What a sweeping generalization that is, almost seems a little racist. I'm not gonna touch this one.

Also, vegetarianism is a luxury a lot of people can't actually afford, and sometimes it's disruptive to a person's health when they don't eat meat (I frankly get very, very tired if I go without meat too long.)

Also, technically, no human actually needs sex to survive.

I don't know why you're drawing an analogy between eating and sex.  I'd draw an analogy between bestiality and pedophilia - in such a case, one person is forcing themselves on an entity that does not demonstrably have the capacity to consent, when many zoophiles and pedophiles do in fact also have attractions to adults.

Basta chiedere. Dopo aver tentennato fra Monti e PD, ho votato (pentendomene) PD - per esclusione, non per convinzione - sperando in un governo Monti-PD in alternativa a Berlusconi; un governo che finalmente avrebbe potuto fare una legge seria contro la corruzione, per la lotta all'evasione, per il conflitto di interessi ecc. ecc..

Monti mi e' scaduto quanto ha voluto fare l'equidistante fra Berlusconi (che lo ha pugnalato) e Bersani (che lo ha sostenuto) - il che mi ha schifato; la goccia finale e' stata la foto col cagnolino.

E come molti sono rimasto disgustato da quel che e' successo dopo; ma non avrei saputo chi altro votare - Monti e il suo entourage poi si sono rivelati pure peggio (vedi la storia dell'India).

Per quanto riguarda le convinzioni politiche invece, sono stato sempre un fan di Carlo Azeglio Ciampi (e Biagi, e Montanelli). Che probabilmente mi mette fra i 'liberali conservatori' -  certamente ne' fra i Bersaniani ne' fra i Renziani (ma Renzi mi ricorda Craxi, quindi mi piace ancora meno).

Direi che il mio giudizio su Grillo non viene da nessuna linea di partito, ma dal disprezzo personale che nutro per i guru, i santoni e tutti quelli che pretendono di avere la Verita' in tasca - specie quando so (per motivi professionali) fino a che punto alcune di questa Verita' grilline tascabili siano solo facili menzogne.

Another problem is that the police in many European countries is a prime example of in effective mismanagement and bureaucracy run amok. Just because there are a certain number of police officers does not say anything about how many of them actually do any meaningful work.

Another important aspect are questions of scale. A very small country will likely have higher numbers than larger numbers with the same level of 'service' because they have a certain amount of inescapable overhead.
