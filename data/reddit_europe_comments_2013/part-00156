Well... when you say it like that it must be true, you're so convinced.

&gt;While I completely disagree with Antonescu's treatment of the minorities.

Oh so glad you disagree with genocide, it's quite courageous of you to hold such radical political positions.

&gt;Let's be honest, the King didn't suddenly realize the suffering of the Jewish population and decided to right the wrong. He did what he did because he knew we were losing the war and felt an opportunity to seize power.

Yes, he did it because Romania was losing the war and the Russian army  had already entered Romania. By joining the allies and turning on Germany Michael probably saved millions of Romanians from death from a prolonged war in Romania.

&gt;That's just a shameful way to betray an ally, even an evil one such as Nazi Germany.

That sounds so poetic in theory, but in the real world, the world where people actually die and actions have actual consequences you shouldn't be so cavalier with words such as ""fighting to the last man"". Turning on Germany saved millions of Romanians, that's all I care about and the only thing that matters in the world or realpolitik we live in.

&gt;We behaved like prostitutes, and we were rightfully treated as such after the war.

Maybe... but at least we were alive.

&gt;Antonescu had the courage to stand up and raise the fist at the USSR. David telling Goliath ""we're not gonna take it anymore"". I respect that.

Case in point, some are convinced it is a war crime simply because it is in international law as such. Some aren't and pass (some part of) the responsibility to the partisans for committing the bombing. Some others would put blame on both parties.

So who's right? Again, it depends on how far you want to go with the analysis of responsibility. It can end only in so far as you're convinced, else you can keep the analysis going until you manage to frame an account of responsibility that can't be countered. But only philosophy requires that, not law or common understandings of responsibility.

So it *can* end, but not forever, it can rise again and keep going until it ends once more.

&gt;The UK does immigration and assimilation the best of any country in Europe (see: soccer-playing, English-speaking South Asians), but on the whole, y'all are way more xenophobic--and shamelessly so--than us. Every generation a different nationality constitutes a huge number of immigrants to the US, and every time, without fail, that immigrant group is eventually accepted as ""real Americans"" and we move on to feeling resentful of later immigrant groups.

How is it shamelessly so? Explain this, you're not providing anything to back it up with.

&gt;There isn't a single country in Europe with 10+% of the population being of a different race. Your countries--again, Britain excluded--are hugely racially homogeneous, and in many cases even ethnically homogeneous.

That doesn't equate to racism...

true,[deleted],null,null,"The history behind it is quite complicated, but I will try to tell it. In the middle ages, there was the Kingdom of Hungary. However the ottomans crushed that state,  conquered a large chunk of it, and have held onto it until 1699, when the austrian Habsburgs conquered it back and integrated the former Kingdom of Hungary into the Habsburg Empire, a state which consisted of many different ethnicities. In the 19. century came nationalism, and suddenly hungarians realised that in the former Kingdom of Hungary, the ethnic hungarians made up less than half of the inhabitants. As it was the 19. century, the conclusion was simply that these are all hungarians, only they do not speak hungarian. In 1848-49 a revolution started against the habsburg rule, where the emperor tried succesfully to play the hungarians and other minorities against each other, however two decades after the fall of the revolution, in 1867 the habsdburgs compromised only with the hungarians, forming a dualist monarchy, with the austrian and hungarian nations holding the political power. 

So, the stage was set, hungarians feared of the nationalities, as they thought they pose a threat to hungarian rule, the nationalities felt that they have been tricked, and oppressed by the hungarians. The solution was magyarization, it was quite simple, the ethnics were pressed to use hungarian language, hungarian culture was taught in schools, official matters were conducted in german or in hungarian. So any minorities felt that the hungarian majority simply tried to destroy their culture, which bred resistance. After the first world war, the empire of the habsburgs fell apart, and many new states were created on the ruins. It did not help that Hungary was flirting with communism for a short time, so the victors certainly thought that they must weaken a newly created communist state. Somehow large territorries with clear hungarian majority were given to the new states, creating a large hungarian minority in every neighbor state. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trianon_consequences.png ) On this map you can clearly see, that and the territorries given to Romania and  Czechoslovakia both had 25-30% hungarian inhabitants, which they perceived as a serious threat to their states. After decades of oppression, the slovaks and romanians felt that they are only returning what they got before, when they oppressed the hungarian minority in their states, with a little ethnic cleaning just to be sure. That did not help either, that in Hungary after the war the regime chose simply not to acknowledge the territorrial losses, and communicated to every citizen that we will get these terriotorries back, fueling the fear of the neighboring states. By this time mutual hatred and fear was widespread between hungarians-romanians-slovaks-serbs etc.

Before the second world war, some territorries were given back to Hungary in the Vienna awards ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Awards ), and some were annexed in the war giving the chance to the hungarian administration to oppress minorities in the newly acquired territorries and to conduct a little ethnic cleaning. After the war these were given back to Romania Jugoslavia and Czechoslovakia to generate some more oppression, with a dash of ethnic cleaning fueling the mutual hatred once more. We spent the rest of the 20. century fearing each other and hating each other. Clearly during these years hungarians were oppressed in the neighboring states, who I am sure felt that every action was justified by historical claims and was a wise precaution against hungarian imperialism, necessary for their survival. 

After a hundred years the images of the Kingdom of Hungary are still popular in Hungary, our politicians still use this clusterfuck of problems to try and gain votes. Trianon is still a popular theme in common discourses, so this old clusterfuck of problems is still alive and well, the mutual fear and hatred still stands between these nations. In the neighboring states there are still strange laws, for instance anyone who takes up hungarian citizenship, looses his slovak citizenship. 

With the gypsies it's the same story, hungarians fear that gypsies will populate the country and take away our homeland. ",0,1375252575,null,0,false,0,cbdwj2x,t3_1jbdz9,t1_cbdwj2x,t1_cbdj5dc,null,1429998067,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,Louisbeta,ITAL,Italy,"&gt;You are extremely biased. I guess that's due Italian school system, 

Sorry, also english wikipedia is biased? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_%28Roman_Empire%29

&gt;During the Republic and the first centuries of the empire, Italia (which extended at the beginning from Calabria to Rubicon, starting from Augustus from Calabria to the Alps) was not a province, but rather the **territory of the city of Rome**, thus having a **special status**: for example, military commanders were not allowed to bring their armies within Italia, and Julius Caesar passing the Rubicon with his legions marked the start of the civil war.

So, Italia was the territory of Rome. France, for example, no.

&gt;With the end of the Social War (91–88 BC), **Rome allowed the Italian allies to enter with full rights in the Roman society, giving the Roman citizenship to all the Italic peoples**

So, only Italians were, per ius sanguinis, *Romans*

&gt;Diocletian divided the Empire into four parts and several dioceses, the so-called Tetrarchy. The diocesis Italiae, under the rule of the Augustus of the West, was divided into two zones, each divided into smaller territories held by correctores:Italia suburbicaria (""*under the government of Rome*"") 
&gt;        Tuscia et Umbria
&gt;        Valeria
&gt;        Campania et Samnium
&gt;        Apulia et Calabria
&gt;        Sicilia
&gt;        Sardinia et Corsica
&gt;    Italia annonaria, with capital Mediolanum (Milan)
&gt;        Venetia et Histria

&gt;        Flaminia et Picenum
&gt;        Raetia
&gt;        Alpes Cottiae

So, as you can read, ""Italia"" was the name of current Italy. Moreover, the current inner division (North vs South) in Italy is EQUAL to the Diocletian division.

To be sure, as Milano is in a plain surrounded by mountains, and far from the sea, the climate is certainly less mild than that of some seacost town.

The night life is pretty good, but keep in mind that is very concentrated in some streets. You can be in a place full of open air bars (in spring and summer), cross a couple of streets and be in a residential area with nothing open after 19:00.

true,Golf_Hotel_Mike,MPyrenees,Midi-Pyrénées,"Hello mate, I moved from London to the south of France in 2011. I came here to do a degree at a French Grande Ecole, and stayed on later because I like it very much. I was based in a little town called Albi, about 80 miles from Toulouse. Generally speaking, the French speak English more or less decently, and it should be possible for you to ask for help or get work done even if you don't speak a word of French. I would definitely recommend you learn French though, because it makes life a lot, lot easier and besides, it's much easier to make friends that way.

I'd say Toulouse is a pretty good choice, the weather is great, the people are much, much friendlier than in the north of the country (I think that's where the stereotype of the grumpy Frenchman comes from) and there is a *lot* of excellent cuisine in the region. It's also very pretty. 

Personally, I prefer living in the countryside because it's scenic, peaceful, and also because I love the outdoors. However, if you don't speak French, I'd say it can be a bit of a bother in a small place where people are less likely to speak English. 

I don't know if you've got some work lined up already, but if you don't, English tutors are in demand pretty much everywhere in France! It's not a lot of money, but it'll help you get by. Also, a lot of the 'Irish' or 'Scottish' bars here (and I mean that in the loosest sense of the term) like to hire British or Irish people for a touch of authenticity, so you could always try your luck there.

My personal favourite cities are Toulouse in the southwest and Nice, on the Mediterranean in the southeast. As you can tell, I'm partial to sunlight and warm weather! Bothof them are really nice cities, they're big enough to have fun things like concerts or art exhibitions going on, but not big enough to make commuting a hassle.

La questione principale sembra essere legata alla presenza di cause di certi sintomi che esistono solo in Italia.

Cervicale (o Cervicalite) in Inglese Cervicaglia non viene mai collegata ad eventi meterologici o semplici correnti d'aria, si tratta invece di una condizione seria e permanente che viene diagnosticata da un medico. Credo che l'articolosista prenda un po' in giro coloro i quali dicono di ""avere la cervicale"" dopo esser passati dal sole all'ombra o dopo aver viaggiato con l'aria sul collo in aereo, per esempio.

Per quanto riguarda il raffreddore, questo dice [wikipedia](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffreddore_comune#Agenti_atmosferici) riguardo all'influenza dei agenti atmosferici. Non c'è niente di provato e la ragione principale per cui viene un raffreddore rimane via contagio.

Thus, a war of epic proportions (one that involves loads of nukes and other types of WoMDs) would fuck our shit up so bad that it'd probably knock a good part of the world back a few hundred years. An average (modernized) person does not hold the skills necessary for survival in such a scenario. For example, were you dumped into the fjords without any modern technology this spring, could you guarantee proper nourishment for you and your family to endure the harsh winter? (I know I probably wouldn't.) Although the quote is obviously a bit of an over-exaggeration, it's still pretty good thinking material.

That said, you're obviously right on the entire-world-encompassing war part.

so, because i live in Lyon, during Revolution, there was a federalist movement (the Girondist), who want to follow the american model, and break the tradition of the superpower of Paris over France, by creating something like the United States of France.

In 1793, The Montagnards who want a indivisible Republic and had many others differences with their adversaries, take down the Girondins (june). Lyon, Toulouse and others girondines towns rebel. Earlier (mars), the Vendee and the little Brittany, was rebelling too, but for the monarchy. France is still at war against almost all the rest of Europe. So extreme time, extremes measures, the Convention launch the Terror.

Negotiations between Montagnards from Paris and Girondins from Lyon fail for a pacific solution. So, it's time for the weapons to speak. Lyon is taken down after a siege of 2 months https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Siege_of_Lyon_%281793%29.jpg/800px-Siege_of_Lyon_%281793%29.jpg. The Terror strike Lyon, almost 2000 people are killed. And two years later, it will be the revenge of the monarchists with the White Terror.

Edit, it works, thanks for the double enter

It's more complicated than my resume. By example, a lot a revolutionary conflicts at Lyon between the grande fabrique (bankers and traders) against the Canuts (the silk workers), seems nothing change. They will revolt 3 others times during the 19th century. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canut_revolts

Labara is great for calling home, 

But Pepephone (can be obteined in halcon viajes travel agencies), Symio, Yoigo and Tuenti are the best for in country use. 

Most of them allow calls between 1 and 9 cents a minute (local calls) but take in to account that the first minute will always cost 18 cents due to a connection charge, this is billed automatically when someone picks up your call.

Also most providers will provide a 100, 300, 500, 800 and 1000MB data packages at 7Mbps for use, depending on provider when you exceed that amount you either get charged for excess traffic or they reduce the download speed.

Make sure your phone is compatible with the local providers, the GSM network frequencies here are 900 and 1800, the WCDMA frequencies are 2100 and 900 too, there are 2 functional LTE networks but they are not available for use for prepay or lower end providers, only vodafone and orange contract users get to use those. 

For a prepay Sim you will still need a a valid ID (passport is enough), since the Madrid bombings which were triggered by cellphones all prepay cards have to have a personal ID registered to them, so remember to not give the card to anyone you dont trust when you´re done with it,

true,Fairwolf,SCOT,Scotland,"[**Robert the Bruce**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_I_of_Scotland) - Best king Scotland ever had as far as I'm concerned, a genius tactician and guerrilla warfare fighter. He consistently won battles where he was outnumbered and worse-equipped and reconquered the whole of Scotland from the superior English army, which eventually culminated in the [Battle of Bannockburn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bannockburn) in which the Scots were outnumbered three-to-one, had nothing but Spearmen and a small contingent of lightly-armoured horsemen, vs English infantry, Longbow men and Heavy Cavalry. His most legendary action took place just before the start of the battle. To quote wikipedia's description: 

&gt;There now occurred one of the most memorable episodes in Scottish history. Henry de Bohun, nephew of the Earl of Hereford, was riding ahead of his companions when he caught sight of the Scottish king riding at some distance away from his troops. De Bohun, no doubt hoping to win the day and personal glory by promptly dispatching Bruce, lowered his lance and launched a fatal charge. King Robert, mounted on a small palfrey, was unarmoured and carrying only a battle-axe.[22] As de Bohun's great war-horse thundered towards him, Bruce stood his ground, all the while watched with mounting anxiety by his own army. With the Englishman only feet away, Bruce turned his mount aside, avoided the lance, stood in his stirrups and smote the oncoming knight so hard and accurately with his axe that he split his adversary's helmet and head asunder, killing him instantly. This remarkable encounter became in a real sense a symbol of the imminent battle and of the war itself: the one side larger and heavily armed but lacking agility; the other highly mobile and employing opportunistic tactics. Rebuked by his commanders for the enormous risk he had taken, the king only expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his axe.

Hell, the First War of Independence had a whole raft of Scottish heroes that played a part in that war, almost all of them as equally skilled tacticians as the Bruce: 

[**William Wallace**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wallace) - Not the tartan wearing, woad painted eejit that Gibson portrayed him as; he was the son of a Nobleman and a Knight. Won the Battle of Stirling bridge, utterly crushing the English forces there and winning the Scots their first major victory of the war

[**Andrew de Moray**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_de_Moray) - Led an uprising in Northern Scotland and reclaimed it from the English, subsequently joined his forces with William Wallace and was Wallace's fellow commander during the Battle of Stirling bridge, but was unfortunately mortally wounded and died soon after the battle. 

[**""The Black Douglas"" (Sir James Douglas)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Douglas,_Lord_of_Douglas) - Son of William Douglas, the first noble supporter of William Wallace, who was confined to the Tower of London and his lands seized and granted to an English lord. The Black Douglas was sent to France to be educated during the early years of the War of Independence, and there met William Lamberton, the Bishop of St. Andrews and one of the masterminds behind the Scottish resistance, who took the Douglas to the court of Edward I of England to try and reclaim his lands, but both had to flee when Edward heard who's son he was. After this the Douglas was landless and an outcast, but chose to cast his lot in with Robert the Bruce when he killed his main foe and made a bid for the crown. He and Bruce suffered several losses during this period which forced them into hiding, but contributed heavily towards their tendency to guerrilla tactics. He remained in hiding until Robert the Bruce returned from exile. When the Bruce returned from exile, Douglas focused his efforts on the south, staging several hit and run attacks and constantly avoiding any forces sent out to find them. One of his more famous events was the capture of Roxburgh fortress; the Scots had absolutely no siege equipment capable of taking these castles, so they resorted to other means:

&gt; In dealing with this problem the Scots responded in the manner of foxes; and among the more cunning of their exploits was Douglas' capture of the powerful fortress at Roxburgh. His tactic, though simple, was brilliantly effective. On the night of 19/20 February 1314 – Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday – several dark shapes were seen beneath the battlements and mistakenly assumed to be cattle. Douglas had ordered his men to cover themselves with their cloaks and crawl towards the castle on their hands and knees. With most of the garrison celebrating just prior to the fast of Lent, scaling hooks with rope ladders attached were thrown up the walls. Taken by complete surprise the defenders were overwhelmed in a short space of time. Roxburgh Castle, among the best in the land, was slighted or destroyed in accordance with Bruce's policy of denying strongpoints to the enemy.

They have the chance to buy some time (to make the public office ban effective a parliamentary vote is needed, and it is a matter of months), and they will use it.

* Main left party (Pd) goes full bananas: they are already having a very bad time explaining to their supporters and electors why they are sitting at the government with the big bad wolf himself, and having to add that his definitive sentence is not that big of a deal would be lethal. The pressure put by press and public opinion for them to pull the plug would be unbearable. 

* The president of the Republic, who, (for many a reason that would be too long to list here) is the real human shield for this government. He made clear that he's not willing to call new elections should this cabinet fall. On one hand, it's a blessing for those in the left who want to kill this government, since they see it as a free ride to try and put together a different majority with the other leftist parties currently sitting at the opposition. On the other, it is a big hazard, because everybody knows how difficult delivering this plan B is going to be, and everybody knows that if you fail at that, the subsequent electoral campaign is going to be everybody (led by Berlusconi) against you.

The epic itself is my favourite work of literature. Some of his noteable (obviously mythic) feats include:

* Battled with Death himself.

* While chasing a Saracen (byzantine generic word for Arab raider), he used a mountain as a springboard for a jump. That mountain was then named Pentadaktylos which literally means ""five fingers"". Incidentally, today's giant ""TRNC"" flag in Northern Cyprus is spread across Pentadaktylos. The choice of location was not random.

* While chasing some other raiders aboard a ship in the southern coast, he picked up a huge rock and threw it at them, crushing them instantly.

Internet: you'll spend anywhere from 20 to 40 € a month, depending on the service you subscribe.

Yes, It's pretty common. 

&gt;then get confused nothing grows anymore,

No? This makes no sense. What are you talking about?

&gt;so then they buy a grass carpet 

Uh, no? Again, you might have a misconception of what a leaf blower is and does.

I think the 'standard use' of leaf blowers is to clear paved areas of not only leaves, but dirt, grit, and miscellaneous small debris of any kind. They're also good for clearing regular leaves from grassy areas, but not for the redwood leaves we have  here on the west coast.

There are plusses and minuses to them. The only better way to clean paved areas would be to use a hose with a spray nozzle, which doesn't go over so well here on the west coast. (no or little rain between April and October) Many of them can be configured to suck up the leaves into a bag, instead of blowing. They're handy for a number of other things where air movement is, or could be involved.

A downside is that the gas powered ones are noisy. Your Mexican lawn care guy or parking lot blower typically starts before you want to be awake. Not necessarily ""your guy"", but the close enough to your house that you can hear it. Oh, those guys also tend to just blow the dirt into the street! &lt;----That shit is annoying. 

Anyway, that's what I have on it. I've only had one for about 10 years, and mostly used it to clear leaves and plant debris from a large paved area. There were a lot of leaves, so I would usually finish by raking them into trash cans, then sweeping up the remainder of the piles.

Alexander the Great was born in Pella, Greece, which  is located a few miles away from Thessaloniki. Thessaloniki became the capital of Macedonia after Alexanders death and during the Eastern ROman empire times. Alexander the Great's descendants were basically the royal family/aristocrats of Thessaloniki for many many centuries.

The people who now call themselves ""Macedonian"" appeared around the Ottoman conquests period and have nothing to do with Greek Macedonia. The reason greeks get offended by this country is not because we are hateful . . it is because the people who live in the Thessaloniki region have always called themselves Macedonian.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Right. So why do did you maintain that 98.9% of NI people wanted to remain in the UK?

Because boycotting a poll doesn't make it less valid. If the republicans had had the numbers they needed to make it clear there was any real dissent, they could have voted. They didn't, so they tried to bluff and claim that the people who didn't vote were boycotting.

I think 98.9% of citizens of NI want to be part of NI. 

&gt;Again, a very quick glance at any map should make the answer entirely obvious.

So that would be the indigenous Argentine, yes? Not the occupying spanish people who lay claim to it currently. If not, why do you want to enable fascism and imperialism? The British peacefully took over an uninhabited island, the Argentine pretenders slaughtered the innocent inhabitants of the land they sit on and now want to take other peoples' lands too.

&gt;Just like in the case of Northern Ireland.

The rest of Ireland is close to the far larger (in GPD, military, population, any metric you choose) UK, so clearly it should become part of our empire. I mean, the citizens of the ROI might not like it, but how would that matter to me when I think my opinion is worth more than yours?

&gt;but rather some funny ideas you dream up yourself.

I didn't dream up the idea that you think the Norman occupiers of Ireland should overrule the majority in Northern Ireland, that's something you claimed. From you:

&gt;When you colonize some place, and then hold a referendum among the colonizers about whether the colonization is a good idea, it's not obvious that that's a very good justification of said colonization.

#

&gt;A cursory glance at recent history and geography is enough to tell anyone that a united ireland would have been the reasonable outcome in 1921 if not (much) sooner.

So you think that despite the majority of NI wishing to be part of the UK, you should ignore their opinions and unite the two Irelands into a separate nation. I'm naturally extending that by saying if you think that an invader has no legitimacy, then the rest of the population of Ireland are also illegitimate citizens, because they're Norman occupiers. and the people before them, again, invaded before the last ice age and have no claim.

You then compared the situation to that in the Falkland islands, where the current Argentine government wishes to invade the islands- but, of course, you completely ignored the fact that the current Argentina is comprised of former spanish colonials and the indigenous population do not rule the country. By your earlier logic (that invaders' opinions are not valid) that would mean that the current Argentine government's opinion is invalid and should not be taken into account. You're making it very clear you have no idea what you're talking about when you say Argentina has a claim to the Falklands.

true,Fairwolf,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;The reason Hadrian's Wall was put up was because nobody cared much about Scotland. It had no real value to the Roman Empire, nor did it to any successive invaders.

Not entirely true. The Roman Empire made a few attempts to expand into Scotland, but every time they did they had to retreat before they could secure the land due to political issues back in Rome that required their attention. They put up the walls as a means of control, not necessarily to keep the Highlanders out. It allowed them to control trade between the North and the South and similarly restrict the flow of people. The north wasn't all hostile to the Romans. Aberdeen in particular traded quite extensively with them.

&gt;The Viking invasion in about 800AD almost completely ignored Scotland for the majority of their conquests, content with simply raiding there.

Also not actually true. There was a brief period of time where they held most of mainland Scotland after they killed the current king, but they were fairly swiftly removed by a Pictish Warlord, Kenneth MacAlpin.

true,pedanticnerd,UNSA,United States of America,"At least in my region of the US (North-east) a lawn which is medium or large is maintained as a recreational area for children and dogs. When my peers talk about houses they're considering buying, a lawn which is enclosed and large enough for children and dogs to play in is considered a big selling point. However, a lawn too small for those purposes is more of a decorative obligation and might be considered much worse than no lawn at all.

Gardens are generally enclosed in fences (within the lawn) to prevent their destruction by the aforementioned dogs or children, and the remainder of the lawn is intended to be as clean and safe as possible. Allowing a yard to go wild would require arcane knowlege of which plants harbor pests such as fleas and ticks as well as which ones could hurt a child/dog with thorns, burrs, or poison (whether eaten or touched).

Personally, I strongly prefer public parks for these recreational purposes. Of course if ones' dogs (or children) are hostile and dangerous to other people or animals, taking them to a public park is ill-advised. Sadly, many of my compatriots believe their dogs and children benefit from displaying hostility towards strangers and thus encourage this sort of antisocial behavior.

They apparently need the time to go to the gym (to sweat doing something completely useless) instead. But the real reason they do it is that blowing leaves makes a lot of noise, it consumes toxic, malodorous and polluting petroleum and it's actually an absolutely useless and even harmful activity: To move leaves around, which are then bagged in plastic, only creates unhappiness (noise), pollution and garbage (things that are useless and even harmful) from something useful and even beneficial (natural fertilisers).

Mi ci sono voluti anni per accettare che mia moglie uscisse di casa coi capelli bagnati anche d'inverno senza conseguenze di sorta; o che andasse a letto senza crearsi terribili problemi di cervicale. Proprio di recente un'amica si lamentava di essersi ammalata per via dell'aria condizionata, e mia moglie mi faceva notare che solo gli italiani si ammalano di aria condizionata (touché). 
La storia della maglietta della salute è roba da nonni (almeno dalle mie parti), mentre il bagno dopo mangiato per me è tabù per un due-tre ore, mentre per mia moglie il limite è mezz'ora. Sono entrato in acqua dopo un bombolone dietro ironiche pressioni della consorte una volta, ma qualcosa dentro di me mi ripeteva ""morirai per non avere ascoltato le raccomandazioni del tuo popolo, traditore"".

true,MethaneInvestigation,IREL,Ireland,"&gt;Don't go there if you come to spain guys, go to Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Granada, but Valencia is really boring for a tourist (IMO)

I could not disagree more strongly. There is plenty to do in Valencia. The Ciudad de las Artes y Las Ciencias took a whole day to get around, and has the biggest aquarium in Europe, with an impressive dolphinarium too. The BioParc is also worth a visit if you've got young kids travelling with you (I didn't, but still had a good time there).

The old town has some real gems. The basilica, the cathedral and the views from the cathedral span the entire city, and are to die for. Plus, where else in the world are you going to find two gargoyles, one of each sex, masturbating into a jug?

The nightlife is decent, but other Spanish cities, namely Barcelona, Madrid and Seville have more to offer in that department.

I love parks, too. Valencia has loads of places to just sit down and admire the natural pockets of beauty. The Jardi Botanic, Jardines del Real and of course the Jardin del Turía are beautiful gardens.

If you like your football, then you can always take in a game at Mestalla or the Ciutat de València, tickets are relatively cheap. Valencia CF are one of the top Spanish teams, and Levante UD could do with your money too!

I don't think Bilbao and Granada have nearly as much to offer as Valencia does. I saw all that I probably needed to see in either of those cities within a day.

Interesting quotes:

On growth:

&gt; I think any program which is predicated on reaching the previous trend growth in any short or medium term – or for that matter, reaching it at all – is doomed to disappointment, and it’s not a good idea to hold out a false benchmark as the predicate of an economic program.

On the austerity vs stimulus debate:

&gt;**RS:  You weren’t against stimulus, though, were you?**

&gt; JG:  I am against the use of that word as a description of any viable economic strategy.  Absolutely, I’m against the use of the word “stimulus”.  I think it should be purged from the vocabulary of anybody advocating an effective alternative to austerity, because it is not an effective alternative to austerity.

&gt; **RS:  And the alternative would be?**

&gt; JG:  The first necessity is to stabilize the patient, who is on the verge of collapse.  This is not about stimulus, it’s not about returning to growth, or returning to full employment, this is about preventing a disaster which will lead to the breakup of the Euro Zone and the European Union, and will lead in that direction in my view quite soon if nothing is done.  So that’s what I’ve been talking about over the last month.

On Greece:

&gt; The Greek government failed to sell its gas monopoly to Gazprom for a very modest sum because Gazprom’s analysts believe, accurately, that they could not trust the forecast of income from the gas monopoly.  And did I mention that this is a gas monopoly?  We are talking here about a reasonable projection on the part of a competent firm that the economy underpinning the revenue stream of the gas monopoly is failing.  Right? It doesn’t take much if we ask ourselves, on what basis does a rational government sell a gas monopoly for cash?  The only reasonable answer is:  When it needs cash immediately and does not expect to survive for very long, because a gas monopoly is a revenue stream that goes on forever unless you sell it, in which case it goes away.  It’s just crystal clear what the situation is from the eyes of the government of Greece at the present time.

On bailing-in banks:

&gt;  The problem here is the scale of deposit insurance, and there are two things.  One is the basic level, 100,000 euro, is too low.  And the other is how you treat business entities, cooperatives, and small businesses and so forth, who have payroll, which periodically is a lot more than that.  If you’re rigid about the question of whose deposits are insured, then you’re going to in this kind of a bail-in, you’re going to end up bankrupting your business sector, which is what has happened in Cyprus.

On Germany's leadership role:

&gt; **RS:  Well, Germans do worry about their deposits.  They hear that deposits aren’t necessarily safe, it makes them worry, too.  But they’re absolutely dead set against paying for anybody else’s.**

&gt; JG:  I think that ultimately the decision on the future of Europe will be made in Germany, and Germany has to decide, does it want it or not?  If it wants it, it has to take minimal steps to stabilize it on the same principles on which they stabilized the East, and on which they built the Federal Republic in the first place.  And if they don’t want it, well, it will go away.

&gt; **RS:  I think even if they want it, they’re not going to stabilize it.**

&gt; JG:  In which case they’ll lose it, and then we can see what is left.  But when it’s lost, Germany’s going to have the problem it had before of an appreciating currency, and an industry that quickly loses competitiveness, and there’ll be higher unemployment.  And its markets will have collapsed and its debts won’t get paid.

&gt; Germany is not going to escape the consequences of this.  Again, it’s a choice that Germans can, and I’m sure, will make.  But what is necessary is to state clearly what the choice actually is.

On the consequences of a Grexit:

&gt; JG:  There’s a large political class out in Brussels, well-meaning people with utopian visions.  They’re not getting out as much as they should, to see what is actually happening.  And there’s a tendency to think that, well, Greece is a long way away, and the rest of us will not be affected if Greece goes down.  But I say, show me an example of a political union, of a confederation, that holds together when a piece of it goes away. [...]

&gt; But to bring it into the 20th century, Yugoslavia fell apart following the departure of one Republic, which was Slovenia.  And the Soviet Union fell apart following the departure of the Baltics, which were tiny in relationship to the whole.  Once a piece of an entity like this is kicked out, you have cumulative processes which can operate very quickly, very quickly.",0,1375276541,null,0,false,0,cbe0ign,t3_1jf2aw,t1_cbe0ign,t3_1jf2aw,null,1429996209,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,demostravius,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I nominate Sir Francis Drake.


Picked on the Spanish despite them being the dominant power at the time. Known as El Draque, he specialised in robing everything he could from the Spanish. 

My favourite tale of his, is he trip around the world. He started with a small fleet of 6ish ships, by the time they got around the Tierra del Fuego he was the only captain left (the others gave up). 
This made him the first English man in the Pacific Ocean.

Unfortunatly for Spain, this over confidence that they where the only ones there, meant there where no defences at all along the West coast of America. Drake plundered his way northwards, capturing 2 treasure ships, one of which had 36kg of gold and 26 tons of silver aboard (and other stuff). He than sailed home, making him the first Briton and second man to circumnavigate the globe (and earned himself a knighthood).


Another story I love is when he was under John Hawkins, they needed to fix their ship. Unfortunately the only dock around was a Spanish town. So they sail in, take over the town and fix the ship. Before they can leave however the Spanish flotilla turns up, next thing you know the dock is crammed with loads of ships, so tight you can step from one to another.

After agreeing with the Spanish to leave as soon as the ship is done, the Spaniards betray the agreement and launch an attack. All hell breaks loose, which ends in many sunk ships on both sides, however Hawke and Drake manage to escape, and if memory serves I think they kidnaped the local leaders nephew as well.",0,1375276618,null,0,1375313892,0,cbe0j5p,t3_1jewp4,t1_cbe0j5p,t3_1jewp4,null,1429996200,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Touring Germany, Rommel was appalled at the devastation of the Allied bombing raids and the erosion of the peoples' morale. He also learned for the first time of the death camps, slave labor, the extermination of the Jews and the other atrocities of the Nazi regime. Rommel became convinced that victory for Germany was a lost cause and that prolonging the war would lead only to his homeland's devastation. He came in contact with members of a growing conspiracy dedicated to ousting Hitler and establishing a separate peace with the western allies.

Più nel piccolo a livello di offerta di accoglienza locale sono molto interessanti i concetti di albergo diffuso (nato in Italia tra l'altro). Molto semplicisticamente: 
-Si affittano una serie di appartamenti ad uso ""camera di albergo""
-Per i servizi ci si affida alle varie società locali (riparazioni/pulizie etc)
-Per i pranzi e cena ci si affida ad una turnazione equa dei ristoranti locali, così come per le attività ricreative

I ""costi affondati"" sono relativimente bassi e circoscritti solo ad un locale uso ufficio / customer care. Impatto ambientale quasi nullo in quanto si usano costruzioni esistenti. In presenza di stagionalità il modello si può comprimere/espandere all'occorrenza.

However, you have to bear in mind that in the Spanish language, *americano* means someone from anywhere in the Americas and *América* means the whole Americas, and not only the US. And while *americano* might be used in some situations to refer US citizens, *América* is **never** used to refer solely to the United States (as it is done in English).

*Edit* Okay, either you were being serious, or I'm just not funny.

In case you were being serious, of course the English can claim Beowulf, as you put it. Beowulf is an amazingly important story in Anglo-Saxon history, one of the most significant documents written in Old English. English people see the story - and the characters within it - as a vital part of their heritage. Doesn't mean Sweden can't claim him too. But my guess is that the Beowulf Sweden claims is probably slightly different to the Beowulf England claims. I would be surprised if Beowulf holds the same significance in Swedish folklore. Perhaps I'm wrong?

A good analogy is St George, in that respect, who is the patron saint of England, and the subject of many a battle cry. Did he live in England? No. Did he speak English? No. Did he fight a dragon? No. Did his shield have the flag of England on it? No. But these things don't matter - heroes, especially epic ones, are not factual things. They are constructs of popular imagination; they are personifications of broad ideals and hazy myths that people cling too.

That same ethics also help when in comes to creating new opportunities. Just count the number of associations (nonprofit sport clubs, and others) in northern countries versus the rest of the world. It is only in northern Europe, were people create this large numbers of associations, because there is such a high level of trust that makes it easy for people to work together towards a common goal.

**Surcouf**, a privateer, attacked a ship whose crew was 4x to 5x more numerous than his (initially it could have been a mistake) but through leadership, deception to his crew (he said they were only outnumbered 1 to 2 so ""every one kills his two englishmen and we win"") and by setting a fire on his own ship, and making it clear there was no way back, he got his crew to win.

**Cyrano de Bergerac** was a real person, and surprisingly similar to the novel's character. He fought in the war, and came back a pacifist (he is the inventor of the expression ""citizen of the world""). His ideas were so unconventional and heretical that he attracted many enemies, but he kept them in check as he was a master fencer. In one famous letter he complains about the quality of the assassins that were sent to him and gives advices to the enemy he suspected sent them (""sometimes you have to pay a bit for quality""). There really was a rumor saying he (and a few friends) confronted 100 assassins to defend one of his friends. It is probably a huge exaggeration.

I consider **Charles de Gaulle** and **Napoleon** to be impressive figures, but there are not much epic anecdotes around them. Both apparently were calm after assassination attempts, but this is maybe not what we are looking for. 

EDIT: Ah, yes, about nerves of steel (or downright inconscience), there was this one with De Gaulle and the general Massu, who was the commander of the French Forces in Germany during the cold war. In the 60s, The Berlin Wall starts to exist. At first it was, one night, just a ribbon of barbed wires the east soldiers laid down. French soldiers saw that and reported it immediately. It is not clear if the order is from De Gaulle or Massu, but it was ""Ok, they want to play? Do that: order some tanks to come and roll down on these barbed wires. Let's see how they react to that."" Well, they reacted to that by calling the US forces and telling them to force their fucking allies to stop playing with matches.

For those who don't know I'll try to explain in my broken english. Portugal was formed by a man who is considered one of the greatest Portuguese hero(comes into topic) his name was [D. Afonso Henriques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afonso_I_of_Portugal). D. Afonso was a warrior king that conquered [pretty much what Portugal is today](http://i.imgur.com/v3wKolp.png), he wanted to conquer area that was [Lusitania](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Lusitania.png), even thou it was against the treaties signed. 

In 1169 D. Afonso Henriques moved from the city of Évora against Badajoz successfully sieging the city, however when the Portuguese were already beating up the Moors in the streets the troops of the Kingdom of Leon surrounded the city and captured our wounded king. 

In exchange foor the kings liberty they demanded the renouncing of the claims over those lands, give back the Galician city of Tui, give 20 war horses and pay 3000 Kg of gold.

And that my firends is why the is a bit of Lusitania that isn't in Portugal, including the old Lusitan capital, Merida. I hope I didn't bored you, I get a bit exited with history, and writing isn't my strenght so I'm sorry for the layout.

true,mucco,trentino,,"Buoni popcorn a tutti, per gli altri tl;dr: la sinistra non esiste

Renzi, per sua stessa ammissione, è un seguace di due politici di destra e di buon senso che hanno fatto politica in un partito di ""sinistra"": Clinton e Blair.

La caratteristica fondamentale di questa corrente di pensiero (la cosiddetta ""terza via"") è il tentativo di superare sinistra e destra dando un colpo al cerchio e uno alla botte, ossia accontentando i poveri e non massacrando i ricchi. Questo pensiero camaleontico è ottimo per adattare la propria politica allo status quo: è in sostanza la politica del ""buon governo"" per cercare di migliorare un po' le cose senza toccare ciò che già c'è.

In un paese come l'Italia, caratterizzato da enormi disuguaglianze economiche e da molte minoranze discriminate, mantenere lo status quo vuol dire essere di destra. Molto semplice. Blair in GB ha avuto un effetto molto simile, sostanzialmente cavalcando gli effetti della rivoluzione Thatcher con il suo nuovo partito di centro, e governando senza dare sterzate politiche. Un Renzi in Italia avrebbe lo stesso effetto: governare senza sterzare dal berlusconismo, solo che visto che siamo in Italia non riuscirebbe neanche a governare e gli verrebbero solo le riformine di facciata che stanno uscendo a Letta.

Clinton diede un'impronta molto diversa, perché era persona di altro spessore: lui riuscì nel fare un restyling totale al suo partito e a renderlo credibile e vincente, dando potere durante il governo a tutte le anime del suo partito - perché lui era l'unico veramente schierato a sinistra visto che in america non c'è la DC (o il New Labour). Da Clinton in poi i democratici in america hanno vinto 5 elezioni su 6, voti alla mano. Bush ha fatto due mandati solo perché la loro legge elettorale è peggio del porcellum.

La ""sinistra"" europea non esiste. C'era Zapatero, non c'è più. Ora c'è Hollande, che comunque parla e conclude nulla, e la Linke. Dalla Francia ho sentito poche parole e zero fatti, la Linke è poca cosa. Tutti gli altri partiti che si dichiarano di sinistra, come il PD, il Labour, e la SPD, sono agglomerati di gente che ""non è di destra"" ma generalmente supporta le politiche economiche alla Reagan e Thatcher, con minime variazioni magari. Visto che non hanno alcuna altra caratterizzazione non fanno altro che perdere elezioni ovunque.

Il PD ha avuto la chance di diventare un partito di sinistra con la candidatura di Bersani, che è di sinistra (seppur moderato, avendo firmato leggi su liberalizzazioni...). Bersani si è rivelato incapace di guidare una campagna elettorale, nonché il suo partito - il cui gotha in maggioranza è di centro-centrodestra vedi Renzi-Bindi-Franceschini, e il treno è passato.

Ora, se vogliamo dire che la sinistra europea è allineata con la Thatcher, okay. Perdonatemi se continuo a dire che sono di destra.

I'm sure it seems obtuse at first, but when you think about it, it makes quite a bit of sense. Reverse the situation and imagine you are the one sending the letter. You have a secretary who witnesses you send it, you also entered the sending of the letter into a protocol that you keep. All the other letters on that protocol arrived without any problem. The post office did not report any irregularities.

Now, the guy you sent the letter to comes and says it never arrived.

Would you just go, 'Oh, yeah. That makes sense.'

Probably not. You'd say, 'That's a likely story. Prove it.'

You DO have to prove the letter arrived. But that burden of proof is satisfied if you present the normal evidence that would lead one to assume - correctly in 99.9% of cases - that the letter arrived. If you want to present an atypical chain of events, then the burden of proof is on the person asserting that to his benefit (i.e. Mr. I Didn't Get The Letter).

The fact that OP basically said, 'What if I toss the letter into the trash and lie about the situation, then they're fucked, right?' shows that this is the only sensible way to treat the burden of proof in this context.

Depending on where you want to study, go and check out the admission requirements of the individual university. They will have those requirements listed for international students and in most cases might even provide a calculation of what your GPA is worth as well as what language requirements they have. That might be the best thing to do, since each university has slightly different requirements. Universities with higher reputation will have a higher threshold regarding GPA to get in and vice versa. 

So don't be put off immediately and make up your mind where you'd like to go. Maybe even contact university staff from the admissions office and give them your details. They might be able to tell you immediately whether your grades and language skills are adequate or not.

But no doubt he was involved personally in several massacres. His actions in Britain sometimes weren't that great either, and he ended up a dictator. 

But this sort of thing is true of many heroes, particularly in the distant past, and particularly heroes of war. He is nevertheless credited with the greatest step in the supremacy of parliament over the king.

The best analogy I can think of is Napoleon. A great man who made some good reforms, he also brought warfare, and with warfare comes atrocties. How many deaths is Napoleon responsible for? Millions, I would think? Like Cromwell, Napoleon became an effective dictator. To the English, Napoleon is a monster. In Spain, the French committed many atrocities against the resisting population. But nevertheless I fully accept that to the French he is a hero - how could he not be? - and indeed his reforms command respect in many countries in Europe.

There are other, more modern comparisons too. Stalin, say, who was the worst of tyrants, and yet played such a pivotal role in WW2, will always be at least partially a hero in Russia. Or Mao, who is a tyrant to us, but will probably always be a hero in China, even if communist rule were ended.

History is filled with atrocities. Boudicca is clearly a hero to us, and yet, though she was wronged, was she really justified in such slaughter of roman citizenry?  Washington had slaves.

This included old age pensions, accident insurance, medical care and unemployment insurance, he also brought in the concept of the work exchange and this allowed the development of the skilled workforce.

This model was taken and developed by many other nations and implemented in line with various national policies.

If you have ever encountered any German engineering from the 1800-1850 period it is not outstanding by any means but within 75 years German engineering and manufacturing process behind it was arguably the best in the world.  Even after being destroyed in the Second World War German engineering was within a generation again the power house of Europe.

I lived in West Germany in the 70s and it was a clean modern functioning democracy with a high standard of living and a well educated population, today even after the reunification with East Germany and the economic collapse it is still a clean modern functioning democracy with a high standard of living. 

So that is why Bismarck should be considered as great person as he built the foundations of the modern Germany, a country that right now is doing the most to try and revitalise Europe and is supporting collapsed economies whist many in those counties are being most thankless towards that support and it still gives all its citizens one of the highest standards of living in the world.

To be 100% honest I have not fully made up my mind about gays I have a rather complicated view of them, it's not a stupid OK or not OK. But when and if like like 95% of left-wing intellectuals and that means 90% of intellectuals scream like a crazy that either you totally accept the politically correct view that any kind of sexual relationship between consenting adults is above cricitism or else you are literally a Hitler mixed with a Torquemada if you actually want to have an opinion about it, then frankly I will rather the other side, not theirs. 

Liberal/leftist intellectuals are just so shitty, they make anyone they want to support with hated by people like me. If the left-liberal intellectual bunch would start screaming that the way to support their holy fucking crusade for enforcing the ideology of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity all over the world and defeating the great satan called Oppression is to eat bacon I think I would strongly consider becoming vegan.  Seriously screw this miserable bunch. 

These days if you are anti-gay you get more hate than if you are gay. At least from intellectuals.

I think if the fucking lefties would not intervent in it, normal conservative people and gays could work out some kind of compromise. Usually we conservatives are OK with toleration as long as there is no equality, that we are allowed to have a social value system that says something is preferable to something else. The normal, not leftie gays I know don't give a fuck about equality, they just want to be left alone and get five blow jobs a night in the toilet of the gay club. We could work out a compromise if not for the lefties with their egalitarian ideologies.

1) there were a lot of others who had second jobs and just grabbed the money, or upper middle class kids that were too dumb to finish college but went through the ""auntie writes a letter"" route cause they wanted an easy job that would have some prestige (being unemployed doesn't ""sound right"")

2) if the people that are supposed to be on welfare get normal jobs, and those that could be productive and are often highly qualified get shit, how is this system going to pay itself?

Father Damien's arrival is seen by some as a turning point for the community. Under his leadership, basic laws were enforced, shacks became painted houses, working farms were organized, and schools were established. At his own request, and of the lepers, Father Damien remained on Molokai.


He ended up getting leprosy himself, but that didn't stop him. He kept working for the community and planning to make sure his programs wouldn't end after his death.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I am a Hungarian living in Austria, formerly UK, I saw this, they are somehow ""less masculine"" than ex-Commie nations, and I think I can even explain why.

I think that from 1945 everybody in Western Europe had one political goal: get as far as possible from any kind of idea  that could be defined as Nazi or Fascist. And this is perfectly OK, but they associated Nazism or Fascism with masculinity, dominance, authoritarianism, manly or military virtues or just general toughness. And they wanted the opposite, so they kind of reinvented that general spirit of, how to put it, liberalism is not exactly the best word, let's say ""literature humanism"" or ""humanism of writers"", that actually existed before the war, I mean Thomas Mann, Stefan Zweig, the writers who were all like just be tolerant, be peaceful, be nice, be empathic, be understandig, do abhor violence.

And I guess they just managed to get to the other extreme, right?

Actually it is even biological. If a man has too much testosterone then may be overly dominant or something, but if he has too little, then more and more research shows that he may get depressed.

So anyway it very much seems like for both nations and people, you can be a nice guy and you can be an even nicer guy, but when you get too much of a nice guy then you are going to be depressed.

I mean let me tell you one example. Western Europeans abhor the death penalty even forced us to abolish it. Now, basically it is nothing but a civilized form of revenge. And this why they abhor it. Because it is not about ""curing a social problem"", it is about revenge. But I think on our side quite some people think revenge is not necessarily a bad thing, it's a normal manly thing, someone hurts your little daughter of course you will be after him with a vengeance. I even admire cultures like Icelandic sagas where vengeance was up close and personal. But OK OK let's be more civilized than that. This is why vengeance was institutionalized into neat clean painless executions after a lengthy, fair trial. Why do we have to be so over civilized that we don't even have that? Why do we have to see even that as barbarous? Can't we please at least be 5% or 1% barbarians, animals, can we at least keep a tiny bit of savage bloodlust in our hearts so at least we can see the mass murderers getting hanged or something? No? Do I really have to purify myself from every tiny bit of barbarism? Well, that's how a man and a culture becomes depressed, because it kills the animal in me, and it's the animal in me that is the source of energy and drive.  (And, sidenote, with men like that, women feel sexually bored. You don't have to be an asshole but you need to have a bit of a barbarian in you to be interesting.)

true,Taenk,GERM,"For a democratic, European confederation","&gt; I don’t know the British setup, however I’m rather doubtful that Denmark can consider itself a unified realm if as I said, certain parts are restricted from trade or docking in other parts.

If the British setup is not good enough for you, the French and the Dutch have a couple of entities too that are part of the respective countries but not the EU. Indeed, in case of the Netherlands you have exactly the same situation that some parts are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands but not the Netherlands and are thus not part of the EU and thus are subject to some restrictions.

&gt; What if Bayern started to enact visa restrictions from people of the rest of Germany or Hamburg decided that Berlin based companies could no longer trade in Hamburg – would Germany still be considered a unified nation?

*You are not a unified nation in the usual sense.* Greenland and Faroe are not part of Denmark, but of the Kingdom of Denmark. Some part of the realm are in the EU, some are not. Part of the deal to be in the EU are these restrictions.

&gt; For the Kingdom of Denmark, the integrity of the Kingdom should obviously have higher priority than EU, and if the EU threatens the integrity, then the EU must go. What remains is only to decided if the EU legislation really threatens the integrity.

And again, it is no problem for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Kingdom of Denmark that some, lets face it, minor parts of the respective realms do not have the same rights as the dominating nation *as codified by signature of several treaties.* Why should it be a problem for the Kingdom of Denmark?

So they did what any intelligent empire would have done: make'em pay tribute and let the poor bastards fend for themselves.

However, if that were the case, and Wallachia would have become a Turkish province, (and this is speculation) could it have been the case that it wouldn't have been able to unite with Moldavia?

The euobserver.com is, as you may know, very pro-EU.   
The fact that this piece seems ""pro-Faroese"" is because these sanctions are in fact illegal.   
  
And Denmark should take the EU to court for it.  

&gt;Multilateral management of shared fish stocks should always be based on the best available scientific information on the size and behaviour of the stock.   

You have to wonder why the EU does not want to use scientific data. Especially since EU stocks are heavily over-fished.  

&gt;The herring population seems to increase, but the EU doesn't want to change anything.  

The herring population is increasing in Faroese and Icelandic waters - because the fish has changed its behaviour.   
 
&gt;Norway got an increase in its quota in 2007. *And nobody else got an increase, including the EU*.    

Please remember that neither Norway, Iceland nor the Faroe Islands* are in the EU, so our waters are in fact **our** waters. 


edit:    

I'm not sure why you see the need to down vote this. I was merely pointing out the facts of this dispute, facts that you don't seem to be aware of. This has nothing to do with population size, this is a dispute over fishing rights, fishing regulations and sustainable fishing.

The revolution in Russia had already begun when Lenin arrived. What he achieved, both as a person and with German money, was that the Bolsheviks eventually became the winning faction. They might or might not have won out in the end without him, we'll never know.

The Zionist movement gained a lot of support after WWII that it hadn't had before. The Holocaust affected this in two ways, for one, it served as an example for how antisemitism was an all to real and existential threat, and two, that there was a need for a homeland that would accept Jewish refugees. There also were the surviving Jews who were now willing to move to Israel.

I'm not saying the Middle East would have been peaceful without the creation of Israel, just different. It changes the dynamics, by placing a very powerful military right in the middle, by serving as a propaganda theme, by being a reason for alliances between western governments and moderate (or not so moderate, but useful) Arab governments, and so on.

Antonescu ignorant? Source that claim, and not by referencing it to Hitler(for your information, Antonescu and Hitler are two different persons, the latter was delusional and still believed he could win the war as the Red Army circled Berlin, while the former knew the war was lost since 1942). ""millions of Romanians dying""? **Source that claim**.

But it's easier to throw words that you do not understand, like realpolitk, is it? Well, [let me give you a bit of a reality check](http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/23-august-1944-salvarea-romaniei-tradare-nationala)(to any foreigner reading: sorry, the link's in Romanian). So, basically, what happened is that Antonescu tried to get the country out of the war with ""some"" decency. He had peace talks with the western Allies, that didn't go anywhere. However, and this is the important part, he did manage to secure an **armistice** with the USSR which, apparently, was favorable to Romania. When did the reply arrive? 23rd August. If the coup hadn't taken place, Antonescu would have gotten the country out of the war in the best way possible(at that time) and without needless loss of life.


But that meant that King Michael would have remained what he was until then: a nobody. So, what does country and people-loving king do, in accord with the Communists? Sabotages the peace talks, refuses to notify Antonescu of the positive response of the USSR and later arrests him. His actions meant that we were thrown at war with both the Axis and the Allies for the better part of 2 months, until an official armistice [**which basically amounted to a surrender**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Michael's_Coup#Aftermath)(notice the difference?) was signed. 130.000 Romanian soldiers were sent to the gulags from which many never returned. 160.000 died on the Western Front in a war that was not ours([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Michael's_Coup#Aftermath)). All because King Michael couldn't stand being in the shadow of Antonescu. You want realpolitik? Antonescu **made** realpolitk. It was the King that was delusional enough to think the commies would allow him to rule.


&gt; Yeah, I guess you armchair general do have the right to critic Michael's decision of leaving when the Red Army put a gun to his head and told him resign or be killed. I'm sure you'd have been a much more principled person and agreed to be shot in an empty gesture.

&gt;Another foreign military, the Italian Army, was widely believed to have paid the Taliban not to attack them. The French were furious about that, with good reason. In 2008 French Paratroopers took over an Area of Operations from the Italians. The Italians had suffered only one death during the previous year in that AO, and assessed the area as low-risk. The French accepted that assessment, and sent one of their first patrols into the area with light weapons and only 100 rounds each, their then-standard combat load.
 
&gt;The patrol was ambushed. One group of ten troops was separated, pinned down, surrounded and wiped out to the last man. Despite what the Italians reported, Taliban forces were extremely strong in that area. But they rarely attacked the Italians, just as Iraqi insurgents rarely attacked Italians around Nasiriyah when I was at Tallil in 2005. Gee, I wonder why.

true,avataRJ,FINL,Finland,"Not sure if I'd use the word ""epic"" about our modern war heroes. Though if we do, [Lauri Törni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauri_T%C3%B6rni) (Larry Thorne) probably counts.

If we look at older, less well-known war heroes from the time when Finland was part of other realms, Jacob de la Gardie probably earns a mention ([for taking Moscow 1610](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_la_Gardie_Campaign)), which I guess is a somewhat rare feat (unless you happen to the title ""khan"").

From the Swedish times, the most famous Finnish(-born) soldier is probably [Torsten Stålhandske](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsten_St%C3%A5lhandske). His noble surname means ""steel gauntlet"". What he did in the Thirty Years' War for the Swedes is written in the linked Wikipedia article. What it doesn't mention of Swedish cavalry tactics is that instead of [caracole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracole), the Swedes (including the Finns of that time) held fire until twenty paces, fired again at five paces, and then attempted to trample and hack their way through the enemy. As evident of him capturing enemy flags in person at [Wittstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wittstock), Stålhandske apparently led from the front. (At Wittstock, he was a Major General.)

From the Russian (or as we prefer, autonomous Grand Duchy) times, probably should mention General Erhnrooth. Just not quite sure which one, I've got my books at home and Wikipedia isn't very helpful. (Noblesse obligé, the killing profession kind of runs in the family. I count seven generals in the family between 1744 and present day.)

From the late autonomy and early independence, I am probably obliged to mention [Gustaf Mannerheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustaf_Emil_Mannerheim). He was a general in the Imperial Russian cavalry, including an intelligence trip across Asia. (I understand that he could reach modern-day Uzbekistan by train, and then spent two years on horseback riding to Beijing.) After the Czar fell, he returned to Finland, was made Chief in Command of the loyalist army during the civil war in 1918, acted as a head of state after the said war, again became the CinC in the three wars that Finland fought as parts of the World War II and became the head of state again (as the only person who was thought to be able to get Finland out of the war - he resigned from presidency in 1946).

Last war hero in the list might be General of the Infantry Adolf Erhnrooth, who was pretty much known as *the* war veteran in his late years. In the ""Greatest Finns"" TV show, he was the highest-ranking non-head-of-state. Yes, he is one of the General Erhnrooths I mentioned earlier. (He married a Danish countess relatively late in life; their son is currently an officer, as well.)

Going for mythological heroes, we probably have to mention [Väinämöinen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A4in%C3%A4m%C3%B6inen) from the Kalevala. Talking of Kalevala, a whole lot of the original runes that were edited and published as Kalevala were collected, on foot, by [Elias Lönnrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_L%C3%B6nnrot). Dr. Lönnrot was also responsible of a good part of forming the written Finnish into its current form, as he also wrote the first Finnish dictionary. As many concepts did not have a word in Finnish (which was the language of the ""ordinary folk""), this task kind of required some ""original research"". It might be justified to say that he invented Finnish literature. (Literally. There was no word in Finnish for ""literature"" until he made up one.) Not all of his invented words stuck, but a whole lot did. He is also one of the few Finns with an asteroid named after him ([2243 Lönnrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2243_L%C3%B6nnrot). Not quite sure how many there are. A quick search found at least [9793 Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9793_Torvalds).)

Of modern civic leaders, [Urho Kaleva Kekkonen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urho_Kekkonen) has somewhat of an aura of both respect and dread. He was President of the Republic for 25 years, something no one else probably couldn't even imagine. That said, even when there was no term limit in the law, no one was probably even intended to serve that long. (After UKK died, a term limit was added.)",0,1375305929,null,0,false,0,cbebus0,t3_1jewp4,t1_cbebus0,t1_cbe24xo,null,1429990774,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"The EU quotas are too high, not just about herring, but so are the Faroe's islands.  At least you admit now that they were too high- so yes, i was right. Perhaps then you should get a higher percentage of the lower quota, but you have to understand- if we truly practised sustainable fishing you would fish far, far less. So, really, this is just a warning what is to come if you truly want to fish sustainable.   

The  reason you should, as you suggested, get a higher percentage of the lower quotas is from what I understand historical- it is what you have been living on, so you are understandably perhaps, a bit angry. I don't care however, i think basing quotas on history  is scientifically unsound.  The quotas have to reflect the reality of todays oceans, not who built a fishing village in year 17xx. Sorry, but the Faroe island, just like any other fish based industry,  have to build up another industry.  Do you know how little fish there is in the oceans now? 


Have too look at my notes, but  am sure you are aware of the fact that the herring population fluctuates.  Also, again, I have to look at the notes, but I am pretty sure that the herrings have moved in the last years, which the quotas are not reflecting.  I am pretty sure that Iceland are making use of that btw. That irritates me a bit, I usually like Iceland's fishing policy (or perhaps should I say, hate it far less than other countries)

Use a dictionary.

&gt;The 'exceptions' you're talking about exist solely 
because the arbitrary divisions between regions (which are not borders btw) 

AFA official languages go, they *are* borders.

&gt;were chosen once and for all based on a one time population census which has since been forbidden to happen again (how democratic)

That process will always be arbitrary because the territorial units are arbitrary.

&gt;to allow belgian people to speak one of the official languages of Belgium

Then why not make everything bilingual (or trilingual)? In any case, that rule *is* used for interaction with federal governmental entities. The language exception is just for communication with the municipality. If they're so Belgian, why can't they use the local language? 

But the most grating aspect is the asymmetry: Dutch speakers is Wallonia just speak the local French in 99% of cases, even where there are facilities. Why can't French speakers do the same in Flanders?

Similarly, some people in Flanders can now demand to be judged before a French judge in Brussels. Why is the same in reverse not possible?

This is why he should care. A law is a law, a bylaw may turn into a piece of toilet paper if one knows the right enchantment in the [spellbook](http://www.guardiacostiera.it/).

Are you sure? Usually saying the right sentence at the right moment is enough to save one's ass. And, anyway *""vigili""* are unlikely to patrol the beaches during the night (especially in quiet and boring places like *Pietra Ligure* or *Varigotti*). He has just to:

1. go to the public beach after sunset, and walk along the beach to search a well hidden *ombrellone* and *sdraio* to sleep under, preferably one in the middle lanes and avoid any *concessione balneare* open until late night.

2. bring an alarm clock and set it to 6 o' clock before sleeping, to  wake up in time before the owner of the *concessione balneare* (who also owns the *ombrellone* and the *sdraio*) comes to work.

3. get a free shower in the same *concessione balneare*. It is usually behind the last lane of *ombrelloni* and before the *cabine* (the wc/toilet is also inside a *cabina*, by the way).

4. ???

5. give figuratively the middle finger to the Ligurian-native *braccini corti* e *maleducati* before taking the train back to Milan.

La modifica dell'articolo 138 è una cosa sacrosanta. Attenzione: nessuno mette in dubbio lo spirito della procedura aggravata e nessuno mette in dubbio il fatto che una legge costituzionale non possa non avere un iter più impegnativo di una legge ordinaria. Solo che i paletti messi dal 138 sono troppi e troppo alti. C'è stato un momento in cui mettere in sicurezza la Costituzione (e mediante essa lo Stato) era un'esigenza prioritaria, e per fortuna i padri costituenti questo lo hanno fatto molto bene, tramite l'articolo 138 e non solo. Oggi, che per fortuna le fondamenta della democrazia non corrono rischi, allentare un po' il cordone di sicurezza dovrebbe essere una cosa normale. Due letture parlamentari con tre mesi in mezzo e maggioranza assoluta alla seconda (più referendum che scatta praticamente sempre) sono la garanzia che o non si arriva (2006) o che si arriva ma talmente male che era meglio se non si arrivava (2001).

""Mon"" opinion est plutôt l'opinion des gens qui vivent cette situation au jour le jour.

&gt;Je vais prendre ""assimilation"" parceque ""domination"" c'est super fort et à part pendant les colonisations je vois pas trop quand il s'applique aujourd'hui.

L'assimilation est une domination fondée sur la supériorité de la culture qui assimile. Si j'avais voulu utiliser un terme fort, j'aurais parlé d'aliénation. 

&gt;L'ELI5 de discrimination c'est ""qui séparent"".

Je ne fais pas de l'ELI5. Il y a les définitions et il y a les cas pratiques. Dans la pratique, l'assimilation est une supercherie car notamment pour les traits physiques ( mais on pourrait dire la même chose pour les traits culturels qui ne sont pas anodins pour l'individu et qu'il ne peut pas rejeter sommairement sur l'autel d'un contrat social qu'on n'a certainement pas fait pour lui ou pour sa situation ), il est impossible de se fondre totalement dans le corps national. Donc l'assimilation n'existe pas. Mais (!), prétendre qu'il est possible de le faire, convaincre l'individu qu'en niant de toutes ses forces son identité, ce que j'entends par mécanisme de dissolution, qu'ainsi il va pouvoir bénéficier de l'acceptation qui est une condition essentielle de son bien-être, c'est en réalité le condamner à n'être personne, c'est le désarmer face à l'adversité de la vie et aux discriminations auxquels il sera forcément confronté et qu'il ne pourra éviter. Pour des explications un peu plus développées, tu peux te référer à des écrivains comme Césaire ou Senghor qui développent très bien cette réalité indéniable de la négritude et qui malheureusement semble presque se renforcer entre les peurs de déclassement qui se font ressentir autant au niveau national qu'au niveau personnel, le chômage qui lui se développe aussi ou la vision idéaliste de l'école républicaine qui non contente de perpétuer les catégories sociales, perpétue également les catégories ethniques.

&gt;C'est totalement contradictoire, et je comprends pas ce que tu essaie de dire et le rapport avec la choucroute.

Cela ne l'est pas du tout. La droite et la gauche, chacun de leur côté ont développé des stratégies de dominant social sur la question raciale ( ethnie étant totalement stupide à ce sujet, les antillais, les arabes ou les africains étant dans une situation strictement identique alors qu'ils sont évidemment pas de la même ethnie, le terme ethnique est adapté à l'Afrique pas à la France ). La droite, je te fais pas un dessin, c'est clair, c'est affiché, c'est sécuritaire, parfois ouvertement xénophobe, parfois tout simplement raciste. La gauche, c'est plus pernicieux. Il s'agit pour les CSP++ qui composent leurs instances dirigeantes de justifier leur position ( qu'on pourrait presque dire usurpée ) en prétendant que le système a raison quand bien même il prouve qu'il n'arrive pas à résoudre les problèmes. Comment le système a-t-il raison ? Car il a fonctionné pour eux, car ils fonctionnent pour leurs enfants, pour leurs semblables. Reconnaître un tort de ce système, ce serait en quelque sorte faire droit à des lésés et dégrader les chances des leurs. Donc on est content, le système est aveugle et il nous favorise. Remarque qu'il n'est pas totalement inerte ce système, mais il fonctionne à l'envers comme le montre bien l'exemple de la parité. Ce n'est pas l'introduction de la parité qui amène des femmes au pouvoir, mais des femmes au pouvoir qui imposent la parité. Pour le cas des minorités, étrangement, on a l'impression que les personnes qui sortent du lot ne sont écoutées que tant qu'elles rejettent leur réalité de minorité. Pour continuer la comparaison, il est bien de revendiquer d'être une femme, cela ajoute de l'adversité, mais revendiquer d'être une minorité, c'est être un méchant communautaire. La conséquence, c'est qu'en fait, il n'y a personne pour défendre ces gens comme il pourrait y en avoir pour défendre les femmes ou les homosexuels par exemple. 

On pourrait aussi ajouter que le refus de voir les communautés de la part du PS est, et ce que je disais plus haut n'est d'après moi que l'internalisation du phénomène, l'échec des politiques d'intégration aux plans économique, social, culturel et sécuritaire. L'échec n'est pas du à de mauvaises politiques, non. Il est de toute évidence du à des communautés qui n'y sont pas réceptives. Et voilà où on est aujourd'hui. Avec notamment les déclarations du sieur Valls qui accuse les musulmans de n'être pas suffisamment français dans leur pratique religieuse. 

Donc ici, la gauche décide de supprimer la notion de race. Cela ne correspond pas exactement à ce que je dis ? On fait passer le symbole avant les politiques, on rejette la faute sur les individus ou les communautés en disant que c'est parce qu'ils s'attachent à voir du racisme alors qui n'existe plus ( ben oui, on l'a supprimé, hop, hop, rayée la mention inutile ) qu'ils sont dans la situation dans laquelle ils sont et qu'il sont donc les seuls responsables de leur propre malheur. Plus besoin donc de résoudre les problèmes des banlieues, de l'illettrisme, etc.

* **Árpád, Előd, Ond, Kond, Tas, Huba, Töhötöm** - the 7 chieftains who led the Hungarians into the Karpathian basin in 895-896.
* **István I** (Stephen), first king of Hungary, crowned in 1000 after a civil war with Koppány, his uncle. Interestingly, **Koppány** is highly popular too, probably because he is played customarily by the stronger actor / singer in the rock opera about them and, well, in the same opera he makes some damned good points (even though its historical accuracy is a bit... iffy sometimes).
* **Hunyadi János** (John Hunyadi) the ""turk beater"". National hero of pretty much every nation in the area. Without him Mehmet II would have taken Nándorfehérvár (Belgrade) and then a considerable amount of Eastern and Central Europe.
* **Hunyadi Mátyás** (Matthias Hunyadi) alias Mátyás I and Corvin Mátyás (Matthias Corvinus). Supreme political and military leader. Renaissance king. Utter tyrant. Still, during his rule the country reached its largest territory ever. Died without an heir. Is called ""Mátyás the Just"", with many folk tales being centered around him walking around the country incognito, dispensing justice and rewarding cleverness. He probably didn't do this.
* **István Dobó** and the defenders of Eger. The siege of Eger is one of the best known sieges in Hungarian history because it's the central event of the book *Egri Csillagok* (lit.: Stars of Eger, official English title: Eclipse of the Crescent Moon), one of the few mandatory readings that are actually enjoyable. The women of Eger are considered fierce to this day because they actively took part in the defense.
* **Ferenc Rákóczi** - lead an uprising against the Habsburgs, failed. Lived his life in exile, mentioned at the end of Voltaire's Candide.
* **The heroes of 1848-49** - too numerous to list individually. To sum it up, there was an independence war, after initial successes the uprising was crushed after the Russians intervened. However, certain political achievements have remained.
* **Ferenc Deák**, though lesser-known than the rest. After the revolution was crushed, the revenge of the Habsburgs was brutal. Deák started a passive resistance movement which was enough to make a compromise with the Habsburgs. Thus Austria-Hungary was born.
* **The heroes of 1956** - again, numerous. The revolution had initial successes and was later crushed by the Russians. However, certain political achievements remained. After initial brutal retorsions (see a pattern?), Hungary became the most relaxed communist country.

But to answer your question, most Greek people that do this rationalise it by saying that the system is unfair or they don't want to pay taxes since the money will be wasted. So, it exists up to a point but it's also an issue of a broken social contract.

As for having a sense of entitlement rather than a sense of responsibility, that's too vague for me to make an honest comparison between Greek people and people of other countries I know.
