With Paris, most of those things are so popular for a reason (the Louvre, for instance... the art, and architecture, there is *amazing* though you can probably skip the Mona Lisa... you can get a better view of it on google).

I never had Paris on my top list of places to go, but I got the opportunity to spend 3 weeks there for school last April so I jumped on it.  I thoroughly enjoyed most of the touristy things like the Eiffel tower (didn't go to the top, don't think it's worth the time it takes to wait in line for it especially when other places offer equally spectacular views for less than half the price and no lines), Sacre Coeur, Arc de Triumphe, Notre Dame, Saint Chapelle, Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, etc.

If you are interested in art at all and want to go to multiple museums, they have museum passes which also get you into a lot of other places too like the Arc de Triumphe and Saint Chapelle.  They also allow you to skip the awful ticket lines.

Use the metro.  It's awesome.  It's fast.  It's *super* easy.  We had passes for this as well, but I believe you can buy tickets in bulk packages (like 10-20 at a time or something like that).

Avoid the restaurants right at the touristy areas.  As a general rule, they're more expensive and not always that great.

Set out with a plan to see something, one of the beautiful gardens or something, go see it.  When you leave just pick a direction and wander.  Get a little bit lost and just enjoy the sights, smells, and sounds.  That was really my favorite part of the whole trip.  Just wandering and getting lost.

**EDIT**  I'd also like to add that if you don't already know French, it'd be a good idea to learn some key phrases and try to greet and begin conversations in it with most everyone you try to talk to.

Also, if you need a break and/or a little help along with a nice little snack (and some ice in your drink)... or if you're just in the area and want a snack... stop by Sugarplum cake shop on Rue du Cardinal Lemoine.  It's delicious.  And they're American and super nice and helpful.  Part of the old defensive walls that once enclosed the city of Paris runs through that area of town.

Another thing is that FH Aachen's international programs are taught on the Julich campus. Is that like their ""loser campus"" or something? Also, if I want to learn more about these towns (watch videos, read stuff, documentaries, whatever it is that can help me get a sense of what it is to live there now!), where can I search for info?

&gt;Don't you think all three are possible at the same time?

I am free if the State can tell me what to do ?

I am free if I can't wear certain types of clothes ?

&gt;Regarding secularism: do government officials need to be secular? 

In theory. [For instance, this big secular cross of the Mayor of Aix](http://www.rue89.com/sites/news/files/assets/image/2012/05/joissains-masini-aix-camus.jpg)

&gt;But would it be safe to assume that one would be allowed to wear, lets say, scientific equations or quotes from Charles Darwin's One The Origin of Species, or maybe even a quote criticizing religion (possibly from Christopher Hitchens' God Is Not Great)? 

Yep.

&gt;Personally, do you think this law is good for integration or do you think it will lead to (further?) fragmentation of the French society along religious lines? 

Neutral. People won't integrate more because they can't wear their cross or their veil.

&gt;Do you personally think this law will be a hinderance to foreign investors or entrepreneurs? As a Sikh, I constantly hear about this law by other Sikhs around the world...

It's only in schools, and in public schools. So not really.

&gt;but is this law considered controversial by the French (do you see frequent protests, media coverage, etc)? 

The law was sparkled by media coverage of teen being excepelled because of their veil. Don't see this anymore.

&gt;Could you also help me calibrate by telling me why more kinds of clothings can not be banned in France (sleeveless tops, some kind of shoes, other hats, etc)?

In France of French school ? In France, you cannot cover your face in public unless there is severe weather. In public schools nothing besides ostensible religious symbol and public decency ; private school only the decency thing but they are more strict. I'm pretty sure the US does it too.

&gt; In other words, taking an extreme view, isn't banning clothing items more in the direction of mandating clothes (and hence leading to a form of facism) than being in the direction of liberation? 

What is not facism if banning one type of item from one type of location is facism ?

true,nobb,null,null,"&gt;Do you view the act of wearing a piece of clothing (hijab, turban, yamulke) to be a kind of proselytizing? 

Not personally, but I consider it bring your religion in school in a very insistent manner. School is the place were kids can escape their parents influence and mingle with other kids from other social class, politics wing ,color and, yes, religion. religious symbol break this and favor the creation of clique, in my opinion. 

&gt;How far should this go? Would you be for having a search every morning at school to make sure no one was wearing a religious symbol? Would you enforce the law by having strong punishments for the pupils? Would you be willing to support a ""Secular Police"", akin to the religious police in Saudi Arabia, but for secularism?

Not far, just the teacher asking politely the kids to hide any religious jewellery that can be see, bringing him to the principal if he refuse, and a letter to the parents for repeated offender. the point is not to not let one go one the school ground (there not weapon), but to show the kids that rules are enforced for everyone and where the republic stand.

&gt;But isn't it the case that more and more french muslim students are joining private schools where they can wear their hijab? 

That a good question, I guess you have to have the means and the place for that. I think most of them will simply turn to the less expensive solution of just a private religious lesson after school, as most Catholics does. 

&gt;Don't you think this would cause (further?) fragmentation of the french society based along religious lines? 

not really, you have to remember that there is only a minority of Muslims that are really concerned, most of them, like most Catholics in France, doesn't really care that much about religion. you also have that the French policy for immigration is not multiculturalism, but assimilation. that mean lot of friction at the start to find how we can not only cohabitate but actually live together, but a more united society after. that also mean in practical that society expect you to integrate and that laws and decision are geared toward integration. there was a time were French society was really divided over Catholicism, but we overcome that and installed a true secularism. finding the compromise that will allow muslim to be truly French and truly muslim at the same time is one of the challenge that we will have to overcome if we want to stay a secular democracy.

The Eurozone does offer support as well, defaulting would not protect from having to cut into expenditures.

When the private sector is attempting to save, the amount they manage to put aside is the government's deficit + the trade surplus. If this does not satiate their desire to save, you'll end up with reduced growth (see [paradox of thrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift)).

So with the German government removed from the sectoral balances via its balanced budget, it all comes down to that trade surplus - and that trade surplus is clearly insufficient for growth. Of course it gets worse when you consider the other Euro nations - they cannot *all* run trade surpluses, those with the weakest export sectors must necessarily retract instead (assuming balanced government budgets).

The way I'd look at it is in differences in your desired outcome- mercantilists used to be about accumulating gold as the foremost public policy, which now would mean accumulating foreign currency reserves. Whereas a modern desired outcome would probably be, by contrast, simply to increase economic activity; and the two goals do not necessarily match up. 

I suppose a topical way of thinking about this would be wage levels- if wage levels go down, it tends to increase competitiveness, and increase exports, but at the same time dampens domestic consumption. If a countries wages are too high, you might want to try to decrease them, and you will get to a sweet spot, where you've improved your exports without introducing greater damage to domestic consumption. But if your aim is to first to increase the trade surplus, you'd carry on cutting wages, through the sweet spot, so that total activity was being reduced. 

As you can tell, that's not a serious analysis of what's going on in Germany, but it illustrates the point. Or, at least, this is how British people make themselves feel okay about their enormous trade deficit!

true,nbca,null,null,"&gt;American laws take advantage of this to block greater harmonisation in drug approvals. Europeans do not want to import hormone-treated beef and genetically modified corn from the United States, and in turn, Americans are afraid of bacteria in naturally produced cheese from France or in imported beef.

The member states of the European Union already have different laws pertaining to what is legal and illegal to be sold in that state, regardless of their legal status in other countries. If a product is illegal in one country it will simply not be sold to that country regardless of the Single Market. Why can't this simply be resolved as another of these matters?

&gt;If Europe and the US were to agree a deal among themselves on liberalising trade, all the other states would automatically be discriminated against. The great danger is that, in the end, there would merely be a redirection of trade flows, not the creation of new ones. Moreover, the rest of the world could interpret a transatlantic agreement as an “exclusion, maybe even a blackmailing of third parties,” complains Langhammer.

We already disciminate about third-markets within the European Union, we subsidize our fisheries and agriculture and we have structural funds. A free-trade agreement with the USA won't change that fact, it won't discriminate further against the countries that we already are discriminating against. How is this FTA will redirect trade routes?

&gt;The Doha Round has ground to a halt, and whether it can ever be brought to a conclusion is questionable. The alliance between the EU and the US could send out a signal that the age of bilateral trade agreements has now finally dawned. With each new agreement, however, total world trade becomes not freer, but more complicated.

While it is true that different FTAs with different countries will make international trade more complex, I don't think it's a necessity that it will take this direction, or at least the different FTA will align on major issues -- every country will have an advantage from the FTAs to share traits and procedures.

&gt;That's not because the CAP is so large; it's because the EU budget is so tiny. There's a lot that can be improved about the CAP - but those improvements do happen.

It *is* so large, and it is inefficient, and unfair. 2-3 % of the population, receiving 44 % of the budget, making food more expensive, harming 3rd world farmers, not focusing on being environmental friendly, giving money to the ""huge"" farmer. 0,8 % of the farmers received 24 % of the budget. Plus, the French supported pillar one, which is the most ineffective way of paying out money, plus, unlike the goal of the CAP says, it doesn't support rural development halfway as much as pillar two. 

&gt;Because inefficiency etc. are just easy buzzword excuses. If you don't like the cuts in research, you don't support them. It's that simple.

It isn't. I don't think it makes sense to give 44 % of the budget to something that supports 2-3 % of the EU population, max. I have absolutely no problem telling you about inefficiencies excisting right now in the CAP, or above all, unfairnesses. And no, they are not being ironed out. Do you know, that for the *exact* same cow, brought up in the *exact* same way, the French receives more money, than the Swedes and Finns? That hasn't been changed in the new budget by the way. I can tell you about lots and lots of unfairness - basically it is tailored towards France/Spain/Greece - countries like ours do not stand a chance, just because we are not them. Greece receives so much more money per/ha than for example Poland/Latvia etc, that it is not even funny. And, no, they will still do that. It is because Greece is *so much more of a farming country*. No, becasue the CAP, once again is tailored towards countries like Greece, not like Poland.


And, if France *truly* cared about Europe, they would start changing that. And, working on their own finances. Instead, Hollande have behaved like a perpetulant child, blaming everything on the UK. It has almost been amusing, if it hadn't been about the future, and about lots of money. 

France is just as bad as the UK, if not worse, because just like the UK, they are blaming everything on someone else but added to that, they would never had even attempted to  reformed a CAP *in much need of reform, unless the UK had fought for it. 


My respect for France and Hollande, has been sinking like a stone during these budget negotiations. 

&gt;If you don't like the cuts in research, you don't support them. It's that simple.

We don't like it, but we are nine million. What the fuck do you suggest we do? Stop the budget forever and behave like the childish selfish France/UK. We do not have that power, but we do what we can. 

Second - you said that we only supported it, because we had problem at home. That is not true for us, nor for DK/Finland. We are supporting it because we believe it to be right, and in the end, better for everyone. I truly believe if that can be said about France- they know the CAP benefits some countries so much more than other, yet they wanted to keep it. 

I think it is sad that you think that someone just wants to cut the CAP because we have a problem at home, not because it is the right thing to do. 

That indicated, that the CAP is perfect, and right, and anyone who wants to cut is is just messing with the French for the sake of messing.

5% deficits are *not* normal (and in violation of the EU stability pact). In particular not for countries who like to lecture others for their wasteful spending.

&gt;It is so large, and it is inefficient, and unfair. 2-3 % of the population, receiving 44 % of the budget, making food more expensive, harming 3rd world farmers, not focusing on being environmental friendly, giving money to the ""huge"" farmer. 0,8 % of the farmers received 24 % of the budget. Plus, the French supported pillar one, which is the most ineffective way of paying out money, plus, unlike the goal of the CAP says, it doesn't support rural development halfway as much as pillar two.

I can argue with all those points, and the overall goal of the CAP as well, but it doesn't matter because the CAP was mostly the same a few years ago and they didn't make a point of it then. It's an issue now only because government leaders need a scapegoat at the homefront. 44% of 1,1% of the GDP is 0,48% of European GDP. Taking into account the tax rate, that means that about 1% of the budgetary problems are to be found there. What about the other 99%?

&gt;I don't think it makes sense to give 44 % of the budget to something that supports 2-3 % of the EU population, max.

The EU budget has specific tasks to fulfill. It's not a bag of candy that should be divided evenly over all children. Support of industry and services, social security, education, etc. are national competences. It's like blaming your local municipality because it doesn't have enough tanks to defend itself.

Ich habe gehört in 2012 sah das ungefähr so aus:

38% konfessionslos

4% muslimisch

5% andere (jedi,jehova usw..)

Da kann man nicht von einer Trennlinie zwischen Islam und säkularen sprechen - Muslime sind eine kleine Minderheit.

Vielmehr finde ich kann man von einer Trennlinie zwischen Homo Sapiens und Homo Sapiens Sapiens sprechen, die sich dadurch unterscheiden, dass der weniger entwickelte Homo Sapiens das für wahr hält, was seinen Moralvorstellungen, dem Intellekt und alten Geschichten entspricht, während der HomoSapiensSapiens das für wahr hält, was durch eine Mehrheit an Beweisen am naheliegendsten ist.

Der Homo Sapiens glaubt die Erde ist alt und je nach Religion zwischen 4000 und 40000 Jahren alt.
Der Homo Sapiens Sapiens glaubt die Erde ist 4,x Milliarden Jahre alt,
weil die meisten Beweise darauf hindeuten.

Im idealfall würde Homo Sapiens also den Finger in eine atomstrombetriebene Steckdose stecken, weil Atomkraftwerke ja nur funktionieren weil die Halbwertzeit von Uran mit bis zu 4,6 Milliarden Jahren berechnet wurde und man dementsprechend weiss, wie man da eine Kettenreaktion auslöst.
Also sind die Theisten dieser Welt alle Heuchler, wenn sie Atomstrom nutzen, aber behaupten die Erde wäre nur ein paar tausend Jahre alt.

true,iamlloydlyson,null,null,"Hi! As suggested earlier, you should try Airbnb instead of a hotel. This will be much cheaper and hopefully more pleasant.
You'll be there in april, so the weather should be sunnier. Use the Velibs, bikes you can rent for almost nothing and drop at automated stations around the city. Thats the best way to discover the city! 
If you're looking for nice neighborhoods, try between Belleville and Oberkampf. Thats the more multicultural part of the city, full of cheap bars and restaurant. Its really nice and you will find lots of great things there, 
a bar I go often is les folies on the rue de belleville, its quite messy and really cool... also go the Cannibale Café. 
Belleville is also a great place for the upcoming artist generation, you'll find great art galleries there, try castillo/coralles, jocelyn wolf... theres also a great art place called Le Plateau there. Not far from belleville is also the St Martin canal, which is a really great outdoor place to hang out during the sunnier days. There's also this great bar on the canal that is called Le Comptoir General. It's a huge bar with an interior garden, a second-hand shop, its very DIY and fun. They also serve great african food.

On the fancier side, try le Marais. Its mostly expensive clothes shops but its quite beautiful, there are great stuff to find there. Bookshops, hip bars, some nice restaurants, although it will definitely be much more expensive. 
Le Marais is also an old historic neighborhood so you can go there just to enjoy the architecture ! Also, you'll find the more established art galleries there. 
Le Marais is also near Bastille. I recommend for a nice ballad to take bikes from Bastille and ride all along the Seine to the Ile St Louis. Thats the most touristy thing I can recommend!

Go the The Louvre and Musée d'Orsay for classic art. For contemporary and modern art, go to Centre Pompidou and Palais de Tokyo (also a really great place just to hang out), 
also near the palais de tokyo you'll find le musée guimet (really great eastern arts museum) 
and le musée d'art moderne. Also you can go the Quai Branly if you like primitive art.

Edit: Oh, and some nightlife tips. If you wanna go out and enjoy some good music:

* Udo bar is a Berlin-like bar with great DJs, it's near the parmentier metro station, really cool place
* L'International is a bar/music venue, they have a lot of free concerts although I can't guarantee it will always be good, check their website
* Social Club/Chez Moune/Silencio (interior design was made by David Lynch but I have to say it's a really elitist place) are all in the same area and are some of the main nightclubs in Paris.
* La Java in belleville
* Le Point Ephemere is a great bar/music venue located in a former fire station on the bank of the St Martin canal.

More restaurant/bar recommendations:

* Go around the Charles Michels metro station to find the best korean restaurants,
* La Fée Verte rue de la roquette (near bastille) is one of my favorite french food restaurants, there's also a really weird and amazing vietnamese restaurant very near called Le Grain de Riz, it's Rue Godefroy Cavaignac,
* another one near bastille, try the chinese restaurant rue Castex.
* go have a drink at the centre de dance du marais, rue du temple!!

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;5% deficits are not normal (and in violation of the EU stability pact). In particular not for countries who like to lecture others for their wasteful spending.

Denmark are *not* in the stability pact together with the UK, Finland is the only country, together with Sweden and Estonia who has never ever broken it, so yes, the three of us *can* lecture France actually. Sweden is not in the Euro either. Btw, the stability pact is *not* connected to the *EU* and/or the EU budget, so I don't even know why you are dragging it it, but since you started it: 

France on the other hand *has* broken the stabolity pact, a million times. You did it as early as 2003-2003 or something like that (together with a lot of other countries of course). What more, you never bothered to pay the fines  that you, according to the stability pact *should* have been paying. So, not only did you break it, you never owned up to it either, and behaved like you should have. So, yes, we *do* have a right to lecture you on financial behavior, it has affected the whole of EU, the irresponsibility. That there are other culprits as well, doesn't make you less guilty. If you don't want that lecture, don't join the stability pact and break it, just like Finland and Estonia managed to. You are even breaking the original pact at this very moment (debt no more than 60 % of GDP among other things), but since the Eurozone countries were so extremely bad at following the stability pact, it had to be re-done, and from 2014, one has to start over again. Gee- how  I really like that the countries, like you, care so little, that it has to be re-done. 

However, has nothing to do with the budget, of course, but says a lot about France's, and other countries respect for EU rules, laws and regulations. Above all, it is interesting if one afterwards positions itself as a country that ""cares about the EU"". If everyone behaved like Finland, there would be no problem, they care a lot more about the EU, since they actually make sure that they follow the rules. If you look at how good at countries are at implementing the rules and laws as well, the Nordic and the UK are in top, then Germany, the Netherlands etc. We beat France. 


&gt;The EU budget has specific tasks to fulfill. It's not a bag of candy that should be divided evenly over all children. Support of industry and services, social security, education, etc. are national competences. It's like blaming your local municipality because it doesn't have enough tanks to defend itself.

Yes, and the EU budget should be fair. A farmer in Sweden should receive the same amount for a cow as a farmer in France (perhaps adjusted a bit if the country is really poor etc, but that is not the issue btw Sweden/France, nor are the costs that different). However, it isn't the case. 

Second, I am not asking money for tanks, I am asking that *the specific tasks* that the EU budget is performing are reasonable,  fair, environmental focused, and investing for the future, not holding on to old ideals. The CAP is not managing that. 

&gt;France is a net contributor to the CAP.

So are we, the UK, Finland, Germany Denmark, the Netherlands. The countries, that according to Hollande and you, that apperently are just whining.  And, we pay more per person btw, at least Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Finland do. 

Also, poor countries can have valid criscism too.  One should listen to them as well, but  I think we can at least agree upon that. 

&gt;This is an interesting article that sheds some light on why Swedish politicians would be critical of the CAP as it is: http://www.voxeu.org/article/winners-and-losers-next-cap-reform

You do realise that the article agrees with me that the CAP was unfair? Of course, we gain from it, because the old system was unfair. It was geared towards the sort of agriculture one has in warmer countries. Think about it, Greece has about 2 million people more, is a much smaller country, but still gets three times as much CAP as Sweden? Or compare Portugal /Finland. A few years back, 10 % of the CAP went towards wine. Oddly enough, some of the biggest wine houses in France got support. That is not what the CAP should go to. And, don't get me started on the tobacco or cotton. Thankfully, tobacco/cotton is removed, and wine is lessened. And, as I have happily informed you before, a Swedish farmer still gets less for the exact same cow as the French farmer. Not because the cow is worse off, we treat it differently etc, but becaue the landscape looks different. The cow is the same - the landscape different. That is discrimination, and I am happy the EU is starting to remove *some* of it, if not all. 

So, what France was defending was an unfair system, unjust. Let us not forget that. Doesn't matter if you are net contributors, perhaps you, like Germany and Sweden should contribut more to the CAP. 

[Here](http://capreform.eu/what-the-proposed-mff-has-for-agriculture/) is an interesting article about how little the CAP really changes. Since we both agree it is unfair, I don't realise why the CAP doesn't change more. 

&gt;No, that's your caricature.

So, why did you, and your president, Hollande say that? Why didn't he admit to the CAP being unfair? Why did he blame the UK like a perpetulant child? Why are you defending the CAP? 

Why did you claim that Sweden/Finland/Denmark/Germany the Netherlands *only* wanted to change the CAP because we have trouble at home?

Scotland as part of the EU is not an issue. The problem is the time between nationhood and getting membership. My greatest fear about damage to rUK as well as Scotland is what happens during an interregnum. The rUK cannot make bilateral trade agreements, this is something that has to happen via the EC. This would imply the implementation of some border controls in order to apply duties and to ensure that VAT is correctly levied. Once Scotland is integrated, then the duties disappear and VAT collection works as part of the internal tax system as happens in other member nations. This was never an issue with the Republic of Ireland because the countries split before the EU was established and both joined at the same time in 1973. The loose borders could be continued. However, the visa arrangements between the UK and Eire are due to expire in the next years. This is whereby a visitor from outside the EU can obtain one visa to visit both countries.

For instance China has loads of dollars that can only really be spent back in the US anyway (eventually, obviously they can change hands a lot while getting there).

For this reason exports aren't universally good and imports aren't universally bad. If Germany exports a lot it can only spend that money on products denominated in the currency of its partners. If I buy a German car I exchange my pounds for euros and buy the car. At some point the pounds have to come back.

What really matters is the internal picture. There is no strength outside the internal economy. Exports are at best a supplement and at worse not relevant at all.

It basically states that the State has no business telling you what religion to practice, but at the same time as a citizen you have to be ""sign-neutral"" in public places. It was felt that in some places ostentatious religious symbols worn by school children could be seen as trying to push a religion on the school grounds, which are public.

As a whole religious symbols are accepted (or nobody cares, more or less), but the law can be used to limit the possible use of some symbols that could ostracize children.

Und der Spiegel ist natürlich nicht anders. Nach Augstein war der Verlag unkontrolliert und es haben sich mafia-artige Strukturen gebildet, die die Interessen einzelner unterstützt haben.
Z.B. gab es diverse Spiegel-Ausgaben gegen Windkraft in Niedersachsen mit erlogenen Geschichten über das Leiden der lokalen Bevölkerung, tote Zugvögel usw. als die Möglichkeit bestand auf den Ländereien von Stefan Aust eben jene Windräder zu bauen.

true,nlddancer,null,null,"I can't honestly give you much advice about hostels/hotels...since I'm living close to the city, I haven't really stayed overnight much. An interesting idea (depending on your budget) could be a houseboat B&amp;B, since Amsterdam is filled with canals. Just look on trip advisor or hostelworld or hostelbookers to see ratings and reviews and pricepoints for various places to stay. I'd advise against staying in the Dam Square area, since that's the tacky tourist area. 

The biggest advantage to your trip will be a bicycle. You can rent them from any number of locations and they will make getting around so much easier and faster. Plus, its the dutch thing to do! The city is totally flat so biking is simple and I honestly feel much more comfortable on a bicycle than on foot trying to avoid all the bicyles. 

Another great thing could be the Museumkaart. This depends on how many museums you'd like to do, but keep in mind that the 'museums' in Amsterdam are not all stuffy, boring history type museums. There is Anne Frank Huis (AMAZING, but go later in the evening when it isn't busy), a secret Catholic church in an attic from when Catholicism was banned in the city, a van Gogh exhibit which I love, and so many other things. The museumkaart is 50 euros and lasts for a whole year and gets you free entrance (and sometimes line skip) into every museum in the Netherlands. I do believe there are cards (called Iamsterdam cards) that give you the same thing for 3 days which might be a better price point but I have the museumkaart and got my moneys worth out of it twice over in 2 days with a bicycle. 

The Red Light District is way, way overrated. It's dirty, has coffeeshops (what the Dutch call the stores that sell marijuana), and is filled with huge crowds of skeezy looking tourists and bachelor parties. I get very uncomfortable in it and avoid it as much as I can (though sometimes when friends have visited, they've wanted to see it, which I can understand). 

There are also endless canals and beautiful rowhouses lining them so you can simply walk around for hours and look and not be bored. It's such a beautiful city. 

Just remember that there is so so much more to the city than the Red Light District and legal weed. There is so much history and culture and beauty.

If you like fondue, go to Cafe Bern in Nieuwemarkt. It's a very authentic, tiny brown cafe with THE BEST fondue I've ever had. I've been there twice and both times, it's blown my mind. Once with my mother when she visited, and once with a friend my age. Try to get reservations but if you don't speak Dutch it may be easier to just show up at 6pm when they open and attempt to get a spot (probably at the bar) for two. The cheese fondue and the steak fondue are the best...get one each and split between the two of you.

Des graphiques de corrélation, j'en ai plein. [Celui là](http://sciencetrio.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/extinctionandpopulation_1026091.jpg) par exemple, je l'aime bien aussi.

L'austérité en soi ne change rien, elle peut être une bonne solution dans certains cas, [par exemple le cas du Danemark en 1983-1986](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansionary_fiscal_contraction). La relance dans n'importe quel secteur n'est pas non plus une solution. Ce sont des mots qui ne veulent rien dire. Comme d'hab, il faut investir dans les secteurs d'avenir et ne pas soutenir les secteurs du passé à n'importe quel prix. Je ne pensais pas avoir à dire de telles évidences.

true,ichundes,GERM,Germany,"&gt; You are no true German if you don't appreciate your great capital city.

I was born and lived my whole life in Germany. I appreciate Berlin, and I know and like a lot of Berliners, but I really dislike that a lot of you guys perceive everyone that is not from Berlin as some hillbilly idiot that can't speak German properly. Let me tell you that what is spoken in Berlin isn't standard German either. Also a lot of you *seem* very rude, but that can be deceiving if you get to know them better.

&gt; And everything you just linked has nothing to do with the decision making process, but simply shows the wealth distribution

I linked that to show that Berlin *itself* is a minor part of the German economy, which means that your whole argument is based on decision making only. Also, it does not show wealth distribution, it shows that Berlin *creates* very little wealth.

&gt; Of course you are going to have a lot of 'poverty' in the largest city, with loads of immigrants

Hamburg has even more immigrants (30% vs. 27,4% in Berlin) but is not as out of line as Berlin is. Berlin fails *catastrophically* at integrating immigrants.

&gt; but thats irrelevant as the main desision making HQ the 'Reichstag' maybe you never heard of it, is in fact in Berlin.

You conveniently ignored the page I linked that shows [there are only 11 representatives from Berlin in the Bundestag](http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/70044/umfrage/abgeordnete-im-17-bundestag-nach-bundeslaendern/).

Anyway, I don't want to belittle Berlin, there is good and bad, but I can't stand your damn elitism. Sorry for the rant.

Let me come in on this one as I have looked at this. Realistically, any new accession would be expected to adopt the Euro and join Schengen.

For the Euro, it is in a volatile state at the moment. No country would be expected to adopt it now, rather to make a commitment to move to it in the future. This would postpone the problem perhaps for an extended period of time. In any case the real challenge would be the decoupling of the Scottish and the rUK economies that would have to happen first. This would probably start in the same way that the Republic of Ireland did with the UK initially running their currency via the Bank of England.

Schengen would be more of an issue. The rUK has a Schengen opt-out inherited from the UK, Scotland would not get that.

It's in Évora (capital of Alentejo) because there they enter Alentejanos and get out Engineers. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do Alentejanos do at the end of the work day.

They take their hands of their pockets.

----------------------------------------------------------




Why do Alentejanos get up early?

So they can be more time doing nothing.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"There's some economic reasons such as 

* Allowing countries free-movement despite radically different economic situations for the population which leads to immigration overflows in other states.

* Wealth redistribution from the North-West to the South and East again due to economic disparity which Poland is a notable beneficiary of.

Those are the two economic ones I can think of *on the spot*.

The main problems are the changing of the demographic of the European political institutions like Parliament and the Council of Ministers

* Most notably veto powers have become extremely problematic due to the amount of states which wield it. In the US if 75% agree then the 25% have to put up with being told what to do (a negative example is prohibition.)  Vetos sort of worked in a union with 6 or 9 members, but now we have 27, soon 28 and rising which leads to almost no treaty change being possible unless every state gets exactly what it wants which never happens. A good example being the Strasbourg Parliament though that was a problem before the enlargement but it's a good example of why veto powers can be bad and the problem certainly only gets worse with more members

* Economic differences between the new, eastern members and the old western members lead to a radical shifting in demographics irrespective of cultural values (cultural values are probably pretty similar which is why the European Project can work, but economic differences are making us not ""one demos""). So we end up being a mostly eastern based union despite the western members being the ones footing the bill, ect, problems problems 

* Improper criteria for entry: I'm going to try and use Greece as the example here as it was let in without proper scrutiny of its budgets which lead to the Euro crisis. Had we been examining states properly before entry Greece's mismanaged budget might not have got us into this mess. Other states have the same problem

I'm running low on examples of the newer states leading to problems as most of them haven't been in very long compared to the rest so there's a much smaller catalog of examples to choose from. These are only the reasons I can think of an broadly explain off the top of my head, right now. There are other issues I can't fully explain as of right now like newer members not complying so well with ideas of democracy and of civil liberties (I heard about Slovenian police brutality at election protests) but as I said, I can't explain those fully so I wont try

The Strasbourg parliament is an issue of renegotiating EU treaties between its member states, and not in the running of the EU itself. And vetos in the council of ministers require at least 4 countries to declare they're against a bill before it's taken off the table. Economic differences will stay exactly the same between the 'ins' and the 'outs' of the European Union, without first giving them access to the EU trade area which provides enormous economic benefits for both the rich existing EU states and the poor joining ones. The cohesion funds have been doing absolute wonders for helping out the economies on the periphery.

&gt;les doctrines et dogmes religieux ne sont pas possibles sans religion.

Bien sûr que si, les doctrines philosophiques ou les dogmes de n'importe quelle idéologie totalitaire en sont des exemples. Je pense en particulier aux trotskistes, qui sont les hérétiques de la ""religion"" Stalinienne...

&gt;dire qu'il faut respecter un système politique opressant sous pretexte qu'il y a des bons côtés

Tout système social est oppressant. Ou alors pourrais-tu préciser ce que tu entends par [oppression](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression) ? Corollaire : faut-il respecter le communisme ou l'athéisme ?

&gt;le parti aime se taper de temps en temps des enfants ou couper le gland de ses citoyens.

Ça n'a rien à voir avec la religion. La religion n'est pas responsable de meurtres ou de viols. Tu veux que je te rappelle quelques épisodes de l'histoire où les gens étaient tués par des athées à cause de leur religion ? Dans ce cas faut-il respecter l'athéisme ? Peut-être voudrais-tu que les religieux soient parfaits, mais ce sont des humains.

&gt;Déjà rien que le faite que tu dises ""anti-cléricale"" et non ""anti-religieux"" me fait rire.

Le terme [antireligieux](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antireligion) renvoie surtout aux campagnes antireligieuses de Staline dans les années 30, de Khrouchtchev entre 1958 et 1964. C'est de toute façon une opposition à une liberté d'opinion et de rassemblement. Pour rappel, voici l'article 10 de la Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen de 1789 : « Nul ne doit être inquiété pour ses opinions, même religieuses, pourvu que leur manifestation ne trouble pas l'ordre public établi par la loi. »

true,hausgeist,BERL,Berlin,"As a south German who's been living in Berlin for ten years now, I can assure you it runs both ways. I'm fairly unemotional about the topic, but I think a lot of people tend to oversimplify the problem with the economy a bit. 

(inb4, I'm *not* unemployed ;-)

It's absolutely true that Berlin's economic situation is horrible, that there are serious problems with the integration of immigrants and all that. It's also absolutely true that many of these problems are due to the fact that our politics are a mess, and that a lot of bad decisions have been made, and probably will be made in the future. The city could definitely be better off if we got our shit together and found a way to deal with these issues. There's also another dimension to this though.

Berlin tends to attract a very special crowd - mostly young people with little money who come here to study, to party, or simply to get away from where they come from and live in the big city. A lot of them leave again at some point in order to get a job, because there's simply not a lot of jobs here. The thing is, those people wouldn't disappear from the face of the earth if Berlin was different. They'd simply go somewhere else and cost money there. Berlin doesn't create those people, it simply gathers them in one place.

Personally, I think it's wrong to judge this approach to life. Besides the fact that it simply exists and we need to deal with it, society as a whole also profits from it. It results in a great cultural life, it sets free creativity, and it provides young people who feel they ""just don't fit in"" somehow with a chance to find their way after all. The German society can afford this, and I think it should support it. Culture is about more than just the economy, and we're in the lucky situation to be able to uphold it. While it looks like a Berlin issue, it relates to the whole country in the end, and I think we can appreciate it and *not* just think of the city as a shithole full of losers.",0,1360878283,null,0,1360878573,0,c8fbicp,t3_18i6gj,t1_c8fbicp,t1_c8f6r7r,null,1431295836,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt; I don't see most of these things as problems inherent in expansion

I didn't say they were inherent of expansion, I said they were systematic of expanding too quickly. 

&gt;issues with how the EU was designed in the last treaty

Yes, issues with the treaty, however that is half my point. The EU is not ready to accept these members due to the political system being built for a smaller amount of states.

&gt;Economic differences will stay exactly the same between the 'ins' and the 'outs'

Not necessarily true, but more importantly that is not necessarily an EU issue. The EU is here to benefit its member states and in the long run united Europe. Uniting Europe should be done slowly and not be rushed. 

&gt;The cohesion funds have been doing absolute wonders for helping out the economies on the periphery.

That's very good for the periphery countries, but it requires the western countries to foot the bill. You could make the argument that they're creating bigger export markets, but they're still footing the bill in the short term and that bill is a lot bigger due to the amount of countries being added so quickly.

&gt;it's unfair to use Greece

I'll admit it is a slightly different issue, but it is systemic of the same problems. It is a different matter, but not an alien or ""*entirely* different matter"".

&gt;I just don't really see where expansion is the inherent cause of any of these problems.

Expansion in and of itself is not the cause, it is the way expansion has been conducted and the criteria for allowing entry. States have gotten in who aren't ready and the EU in many cases is not ready ether.

If cowording foreign policy is hard now or coming up with a concept for what a federal europe should look like is hard now, just think how much harder it will be when we have even more members who are even more different in so many ways.

It is a multiple faceted issue. The 5 problems I brought up are, as I said, just the ones I alone could think of off the top of my head. I'm not in the best situation to be arguing the case as of right now due to time restrictions, but even if you discount all of the problems I listed, it is still note worthy that I could pull those up and put them all under the banner of expansion problems with such little effort. Sorry for haphazzard writing. I hope my points can be interpreted.

Why do you presume there is an objective choice? I could choose anything, for example,  your crude ""scientific"" distinction descriminates based on phyla, but I could choose to discriminate on  class,  subclass, order, family,  genus,  species etc.  Or I could choose to only include animals that have an extant classification level of ""least concern"". I might also choose based on cost (environmental and monetary) and ease of acquisition.  This is before we even consider what actually tastes nice. I can define any criteria I like really and each can be assigned a moral weighting factor.

Is this what the UK is becoming? The private sector being funded by the government (as long as the profits remain private)?

Seriously.. the only way this would have made sense is this:

- Someone is unemployed
- Government finds them work at.. for example the discount store
- That person is no longer unemployed and getting paid by the company they work for.. **NOT** the government in the form of benefits.

The whole thing is an oxymoron.. but hey, as long as the *beeep*ing eurocrats aren't spending the public's money..

edit: The whole thing would make sense if it was something like making them show up for a couple of hours (at least long enough to see who shows up) to clean public property like roads or help fix stuff etc.. but getting them to work for private companies to get paid public money? wtf?

The final nail in the coffin for me was the action Turkey has been taking for the last few months. It's not highlighted in the news but Turkey has on several occasions allowed Al-Nusra (Al-Qaeda in Iraqs new name) to use their territory to out flank the Syrian Army and Kurds defending their towns. In fact It was Turkey who has been pressuring and planning these attacks. That way the Syrian Kurds won't be in a strong position when the Syrian civil war ends. Thousands of innocent people have died, many more have been made refugees and because these guys are Al-Qaeda they've been terrorising Christian Syrians.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"Yeah.. seems to me though that if a company like Poundland knows they can get lots of ""unemployed"" people to work for them for ""free"" or somehow heavily subsidized, they can just fire their staff, creating more unemployed people.

The scheme perhaps is a good way to check if someone who is on unemployment benefits is actually willing to go to work, which overall is a good *concept* but clearly this is a bad way of doing it. They should just make people have to show up for something trivial at random times during the week (this will weed out people who may be working illegally while claiming benefits), while making sure that they are going for interviews *if jobs are available*.

Seems like Poundland has need of workers, eh? Oh but wait.. they'll actually have to hire more staff and pay them? Nah.. nevermind, don't need any.

Also, not sure exactly how benefits work in the UK nowadays.. how long are people allowed benefits for? Over here it's something along the lines of 6 months of ~60% of your previous sallary paid every 6 weeks starting 3 months after you first sign on and then something like 350 euros per 6 weeks for another 6 months after that and then you've shat out, and to become eligible for it again, you need to work for about another year or so -- lets just say that it's way better to go get a minimum wage job and get paid ~850 euros (gross) per month rather than wait for the benefit to kick in.

true,dislikesthepublic,ENGL,England,"I have very little experience with the benefits system myself. However from what I've been able to find, it is broken down into several sections such as job seekers allowance which for an individual can range from about £50-£70 a week. 

Then there is housing benefit which is dependent upon where you choose to live, for example if you were to live in a 1 bed flat or sharing accommodation you can get up to £250 a week however this is dependent upon area (In my area you can get around £80). It gets complicated quickly but there are people who have it down to an art and milk every penny. I know at least one person who for the past few years would have made more if she didn't work however I think she has since got promoted and this is no longer the case.

I'm not sure how big an issue benefit fraud genuinely is, i think to most common incidents are people claiming to live separately when really they live together as i believe the council tax is cheaper.   

As for the scheme I feel it would have been at least more tolerable had it been restricted to certain industries which actually require a skilled employee and excluded places like Poundland as it it clear these places would abuse the system set in place.

I agree, but I hardly believe it is a popular view on r/europe. I get downvoted just for saying the Euro is an imperfect currency union. 

However, that is unimportant, what really makes me sad though is that most of the Greeks as you say, are opting for a slow death, with 70 + support for it.  

I too believe that Greece (and Portugal, Spain) have to leave the Euro, it is the only way for you to recover. I mean, if one look at East/West Germany that also entered into a currency union, although a complete one, East Germany is still not as competitive, after 20 years. And they have been receiving trillions, permanent tranfers to support the social system, and had no burdensome foreign debt (I am not saying Greece is on the level DDR was, just that the Greek economy and competitiness was different enough from Germany/France). What do the Greeks have to look forward too - 20 more years of what is happening now? I can't even fathom that. I think the sooner you leave the better.

My original plan for semana santa was to spend it on la costa del sol.  Some of my older friends recommended Marbella to me, however these people were all very well off and like ritzy vacations.  

I get that it's your honeymoon and you want something great but you can get SO SO SO much more in nearby towns.  Marbella is overpriced and the same as everything else on the coast.  

**Fuengirola**:  Absolutely gorgeous, cheap and a short drive from Marbella if you want to spend a day there.  I used this as my ""base camp"" for my costa del sol vacation.  It's got a wide variety of everything you might want or need from a honeymoon with very reasonable prices.  It also has a long train rail directly to Malaga so you can easily make a short trip (I did 2 nights in a hostel there during the week) to see that.  It's a great little town.

And go to Gibraltar when you're down there!  I believe my bus trip from Fuengirola to Gibraltar was 12 euros, and worth every bit of it.  I've traveled extensively through Europe and Spain and it remains one of my favorite places.  It's a little pricey so you may want to take the bus from Fuengirola bright and early and leave on the last bus (or only stay one night) but you have to go.  I took the hike up the rock rather than the dumb cable car and it was awesome.  It's like entering a new world, hiking through a jungle surrounded by monkeys.

It is only possible if multiple citizenship laws regarding the birth of a child overlap. For example if one countries citizenship is given out by law of soil with the child having german parents, therefore inheriting the citizenship. (I think the law of soil is applicable in germany again since the 2000 reforms)

Another scenario that would give you a dual citizenship would be if you apply for a german citizenship, but there is no way to revoke your former citizenship officially, or if it is connected with unbearable burdens and costs for you.

You can't seriously complain about others running deficits if you're having them yourself.

&gt;France on the other hand has broken the stabolity pact, a million times. You did it as early as 2003-2003 or something like that (together with a lot of other countries of course).

And so have a lot of other countries, including the ones that are now being grumpy about it, eg. Germany. Which illustrates that there's is no particular moral high ground in this debate.

&gt;However, has nothing to do with the budget, of course, but says a lot about France's, and other countries respect for EU rules, laws and regulations.

Again, many if not most countries have at some point ignored the rules. At that time they justified it by complaining about the silly rules the EU made up, now they complain about the EU because it didn't enforce those rules.

&gt;Yes, and the EU budget should be fair. A farmer in Sweden should receive the same amount for a cow as a farmer in France (perhaps adjusted a bit if the country is really poor etc, but that is not the issue btw Sweden/France, nor are the costs that different). However, it isn't the case. 

Point me to that specific case.

&gt;Second, I am not asking money for tanks, I am asking that the specific tasks that the EU budget is performing are reasonable, fair, environmental focused, and investing for the future, not holding on to old ideals. The CAP is not managing that.

Nobody contradicts that. The point is that that is an issue that completely unrelated with the current budget problems. The CAP has its problems but they are irrelevant to the budgetary problems in the EU and the world. That's a financial issue. Coupling the two is just opportunistic scapegoating, and unproductive to boot because the CAP problems are a matter of quality, while budgets are a matter of quantity.

&gt;&gt;France is a net contributor to the CAP.
&gt;So are we, the UK, Finland, Germany Denmark, the Netherlands. The countries, that according to Hollande and you, that apperently are just whining. And, we pay more per person btw, at least Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Finland do.

The point is that the claim that France is just using the CAP for its own profit is unbased.

&gt;You do realise that the article agrees with me that the CAP was unfair? 

No, the article does not make moralistic statements. It just impartially describes the problems in reforming the CAP, the expected changes and the fact that countries do not just pick whatever position suits their own financial interests. That contradicts your general idea that the CAP is just some racket that some EU countries refuse to change because they use it to suck money from you hardworking people.

&gt;Think about it, Greece has about 2 million people more, is a much smaller country, but still gets three times as much CAP as Sweden?

The agricultural sector in Greece makes up a much bigger part of their GDP. That's not strange at all. In any case, the allotted subsidies are expected to not match the population or land area, otherwise we should just give each country a sum that corresponds to that and couldn't do anything else.

&gt;The cow is the same - the landscape different.

Subsidizing production without regards for the environment it happens in is one of the faults of the past CAP policies. If the CAP continues to be modernized, you will see more divergence from a simple correlation between population, production or land area and subsidies.

&gt;So, what France was defending was an unfair system, unjust.

Irrelevant, we're talking about the budget: how much money should the CAP get? The question never was whether the CAP works well, the question was whether (and where) there should be cuts to reduce the expenses in the EU budget.

&gt;I don't realise why the CAP doesn't change more.

Different people have different interests. It takes time to make them agree. It's called politics.

&gt;So, why did you, and your president, Hollande say that?

Cite it, I can't keep track of everything every president of every other country says.

&gt;Why didn't he admit to the CAP being unfair?

Probably because it isn't relevant.

&gt;Why did he blame the UK like a perpetulant child?

Because they often are.

&gt;Why are you defending the CAP?

I'm not. I'm just saying it's not relevant in the budgetary issue. It's just ridiculous to imply that the very small EU budget is more than a footnote in the current budgetary troubles, and it's hypocritical to complain that the EU doesn't do this or that or makes the wrong cuts if it's you who insist that they have to cut.

&gt;Why did you claim that Sweden/Finland/Denmark/Germany the Netherlands only wanted to change the CAP because we have trouble at home?

They didn't have actual demands that could be met; it's just an excuse.

Sinon OK, Krugman a bien montré que réduire les dépenses pour réduire les dépenses a un effet négatif en général (j'ai la flemme d'aller regarder à quoi correspond [ce point](http://i.imgur.com/EOiANjn.png) ). Mais peut-être que la hausse du chômage a d'autres causes, par exemple la montée de la Chine, un euro trop fort, l'euro tout court, l'absence de droits de douane, l'afflux d'immigrés du printemps arabe, la fuite des cerveaux, le poids du service de la dette, voire même l'absence de souveraineté du peuple, la défiance envers les élites, le manque de liberté de la presse...

Pour avoir les bonnes réponses, il faut déjà avoir les bonnes questions. On sait déjà que Krugman est contre l'austérité. Son raisonnement est biaisé. Par contre, le jour où le FMI arrêtera de faire des préconisations comme [celle là](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2012/car111312a.htm), ce sera une preuve que l'austérité est un concept dépassé.",0,1360922152,null,0,false,0,c8fmm09,t3_18ikqv,t1_c8fmm09,t1_c8ff19o,null,1431301112,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

That's still an unsustainable approach - as populations age, they'll necessarily be less credit-bingey and desire more savings (a 'la Japan today), at that point governments will *have* to run deficits for high employment.

Germany should leave unless it can accommodate itself to transferring up to 5% of GDP (Edward Chancellor says 3.6%), to its poorer 'family' year-on-year, in perpetuity.

Federal US taxation is ~25% of GDP and the variation in spending levels between rich and poor states is ~5% of GDP, so a variation of roughly 20% of federal spending.

How big a budget would the EU need to be able to slosh around 5% of combined GDP into the poor regions (bearing in mind the current budget is only 1% (and heavily constrained by CAP payments)?

The other point is that americans accept this, they are all american, whereas we are rapidly finding out just how german the germans are, and finnish the finns are, when it comes to firehosing cash at nations they consider to be essentially delinquent!

In the UK this 'sloshing' occurs in the form of:

 1.   national pay-bargaining which benefits poorer regions (teachers, nurses, etc)

 2.   national social benefits more generous than poorer regions could afford alone (eg.housing benefit in glasgow)

 3.   targeted regional development grants/discounts to encourage business growth (objective 1 EU/WEFO funds)

 4.   additional infrastructure spending to support the local economy (the mainland-skye bridge)

It doesn't work like that, you can't just propel people to an higher productivity and wages by making it into a law, a minimum wage is in effect discriminating against those who have lower skills by making it unlawful to pay them what their productivity is worth and therefore employers will have to discriminate against these people.

It really is no coincidence that the youth unemployment rate is much higher than the average unemployment specially in those countries with higher minimum wages.

&gt;I think Romania could only stand to benefit from imposing higher minimum wages, sure, inflation might go up, but it's not like we're on the Euro and can't do anything about that. 

Firstly, inflation is only caused by the amount of money there is in an economy, if the ECB prints money, you'll have inflation, that's the only way. If the government of Romania controls wages and prices, you'll have unemployment and shortages but no inflation.

Secondly, people with average skills might benefit from a minimum wage as they'll have less competition from people with low skills for their labour however this is in no way beneficial for the society as a whole - you'll be making it that much more difficult for people with less qualifications to find employment, earn some income and improve their skills on the job.

true,rimo,null,null,"Overtime pay also exists in the Netherlands, but it all depends on where you work. Many of the employment agreements are in a CAO (collective labour agreement), and one of those agreements is payment for overtime. An overtime pay of 200% on Sundays for cashiers is not extra-ordinary, neither are such overtime pays on holidays.

Working overtime is relatively expensive for the employer. Structural overtime work is forbidden by law, to prevent exploitation for workers. These agreements and laws make it so employers rather want more employees to do the work instead of letting less employees work overtime. This is great against unemployment. 

Since it is not mandated by law how overtime is arranged other constructions also exists, where you can save up hours and turn those into a vacation. Or you can even use those in a special construction where your employer will buy something for you and treat your overtime hours as currency. This is attractive for both parties, since the employers can pay you less for that hours, but you can get a computer/bicycle/etc. without paying as much taxes over your income (your income being the new bicycle for instance).

I think 60 hours a week is the limit of work per week, but constantly hitting that limit is not feasible because there is also a limit of 768 hours per 16 weeks, making 48 hours per week the average maximum you can work.

**European parliament member of the Green party: Cohn-Bendit withdraws from politics**


**It's his end in active politics: The Green European parliamentarian Daniel Cohn-Bedint won't stand for vote at the next European election. ""I'm going to listen to my body now"", says the 67 year old**

Straßburg - Leader of the Parisian student riot, member of the Green party since 1984, advisor to Joschka Fischer when he was environment minister in Hessen, member of the EU parliament since 1994: Daniel Cohn-Bendit is a experienced politician, now as he's 67 years old he wants so withdraw slowly. He wont be up for vote at the next European election. Cohn-Bendit made this announcement in a new book which will be published in France next Thursday. He will continue to attend demonstrations and to vote, says Cohn-Bendit who's a member of the European parliament since 1994.

Cohn-Bendit announced years before that he will retire from active politics with 68 years. He will reach that age this April. Main cause for this decision is his health situation, says the politician who was treated for a small cancerous ulcer a few months back.

""I'm going to listen to my body now. I don't feel capable to do another campaign for the EU-parliament, which would demand a 100% physically and mental attendance"", writes the Green politician in his 40 page booklet titled ""Pour supprimer les partis politiques!? Réflexions d'un apatride sans parti"" (Abolishing the political parties? Thoughts of a stateless person without party).

The European Greens want to go into campaign with a common list of candidates in 2014. Cohn-Bendit, one of the best known EU politicians, was in discussion for the top-spot on the list. A few months ago Cohn-Bendit distanced himself from the French Greens whose European line he often criticized. Cohn-Bendit was member of the parliament in behalf of the German Green party.

Foreigners only fund government deficits if it is they, rather than households, that is saving in the government's currency through trade deficits.

Most of the government's deficit goes to the private sector, some of it leaves overseas via the trade deficits that nation runs. Again though, you'll note that it is the government's deficits that make this continual saving of the external sector via trade deficits possible.

EDIT: To add to that last statement a bit: the US has trade deficits *because* foreign nations desire to hold USD. How do they acquire USD?

I've heard Fuengirola is also great, but I drove by it on the highway and unfortunately can't comment on it personally.


In my opinion, the regions are pretty different as far as Catalunya and the Malaga section of Andalucia go. But if your main reason for going is coast and beach, the Costa del Sol is absolutely amazing and worth the visit. It's soo warm and sunny, even more so than up north. If I were you, and having gone to both places, I would probably choose the Costa del Sol.

The main difference I see from a legal minimum wage is that it doesn't apply to some small-scale employment that happens outside the regular labor system. So for example if you hire an individual person to clean your apartment, there isn't a legal requirement for what you must pay them. On the other hand, if you hire a company to clean your apartment, what they pay their cleaning staff is probably covered by the negotiated wage.

Antwort:

The Sonntagsruhe means, nobody should have to work on Sunday, nor should he/she be disturbed by noisy neighbours or stuff like that. In ancient times the sunday was reserved for worhipping god (just like the sabbath) but in recent times the sunday is supposed to be a day for the family and friends.

You've already written off the genus Homo as a source of meat (for absolutely no ""scientific"" reason other than your personal opinion) and so by extension I can write off the genus Equus for equally subjective reasons.

&gt;My answer is nothing and those that are outraged about horse meat being labeled as beef are outraged about horse meat being labeled as cow meat.

The outrage is about the labelling, quality control and the antibiotics.  This is hot story in France as well at the moment and they don't mind a bit of horse.

Offro alcune considerazioni.

Prima considerazione - scegli una facoltà che ti piaccia: intrappolato per anni a seguire corsi tenuti da docenti psicopatici, fra compagni di corso bastardi, se ciò che stai studiando non ti piace, non c'è futuro.
E se non ti piace, l'idea di farlo poi per il resto della vita come lavoro... incubo, eh?

Seconda considerazione - dicono che gli ingegneri trovano sempre abbastanza in fretta un lavoro. Probabilmente più degli economisti (le banche stanno licenziando - ma non creano nuovi posti):

Terza considerazione - se ne esiste la possibilità, cerca un corso breve post-diploma che ti metta in condizione di avere un titolo e di lavorare nel tuo ambito di preferenza **prima** di iscriverti. È vero che il nostro paese penalizza gli studenti lavoratori, ma poter pagare le proprie tasse universitarie, ed avere un piano B è indispensabile.

Spero che serva.

**Food :**

Go to www.lafourchette.com, you'll get some great discount (up to 50%) by booking through the website. Some restaurants I really like : 

* grapillon (rue tiquetonne), 27€ menu at night. Really good, foie gras in almost every dishes.

* Tir bouchon (rue tiquetonne), great lunch menu (15€,starters + main course + glass of wine)

* Le Reminet ( check it out on lafourchette, 40% discount) really fancy, the food is delicious

* Le verre à pied (bottom of rue mouffetard) pretty nice lunch menu, love the neighborhood (latin quarter)

* De Clerq (rue Saint Jacques, near the Pantheon). Not really a restaurant, but a great place to enjoy excellent belgian fries. You can eat at the pub just next door.


**Concerts**

* le petit bain www.petitbain.org (in french) which is a boat near the bibliothèque françois mitterand. Really good ambiance.

* la maroquinerie www.lamaroquinerie.fr (in french too) pretty far from the center, but a really nice place.

* Point Ephemere www.pointephemere.org is another good one

* La miroiterie, 5min from la maroquinerie. I heard really good things about it, but the one time I actually went there it was packed ... I think there are jazz jam sessions every sunday from 7pm to 10pm. If you are in the area just check it out, it's an interesting place

En quoi la notion d'effort structurel est-elle pertinente, ne faudrait-il pas regarder en détail quel secteur a été touché ?

Les épargnants ont trop d'argent, il leur brûle les doigts. Ils sont même prêts à payer les états pour le dépenser (on a ainsi vu des taux d'intérêts négatifs). D'un autre côté, plus personne ne trouve d'idées/de force/de courage pour créer de la valeur... et des emplois. Ainsi il n'y a que très peu de demande d'investissement privé. 

Les pays qui ont vu leur chômage baisser sont peut-être tout simplement ceux où les agents privés comme l'État sont optimistes. Est-ce que c'est l'État, via la dépense publique, qui crée le terrain propice à la création d'emploi ou est-ce que l'état d'esprit optimiste de la population influence l'État dans ses dépenses ?

Quand on parle d'austérité, qu'on s'intéresse à ses effets, regarder la variation de déficit des budgets publics me semble être la mesure la plus directe. La théorie de l'austérité c'est qu'il faut réduire les dépenses, n'importe lesquelles.

&gt; Par exemple, en quoi l'effort structurel Irlandais est-il le même que l'effort structurel Grec et pourquoi aurait-il le même effet ?

Au risque de me répéter, on ne s'intéresse ici qu'à la théorie macroéconomique qui dit qu'une baisse de l'endettement de l'état permet une reprise de l'économie. Ce graphe semble montrer qu'elle est fausse.
Point. Fermez le ban. On ne parle pas de libéralisme, ou du QI des cadres républicains. On ne dit pas que les situations ou les décisions dans deux pays sont strictement identiques. Là, on dit juste que d'une façon générale, les pays qui ont diminuer leurs dépenses publiques ont augmenté leur chômage.

&gt; Il reste cette exception. À quoi correspond-elle ?

Il faudrait chercher dans les chiffres du FMI pour le dire. Il y a également  4 autres pays qui sont sur une droite qui confirmerait la théorie des austéristes.

On est là dans une approche statistique. Comme tu le dis toi même, tous ces pays ne sont pas identiques. Il peut y avoir des pays qui ont un dynamisme énorme et réduisent leur budget, il peut y avoir des pays où l'état dépense plus et mal et creuse ainsi le chômage. L'étude statistique donne une tendance, pas une vérité absolue. Et la tendance qui nous intéresse là est : ""la plupart des pays qui ont diminué leur déficit ont eu une augmentation du chômage"". Tout ce qui nous intéresse c'est que ça contredit la théorie de l'austérité qui annonçait le contraire.

C'EST TOUT! Ça ne dit pas que Krugman est Dieu ou qu'il a raison sur quelque chose que ce soit.

J'avais essayé de récapituler toutes les prestations sociales, afin d'estimer le montant que l'on pourrait donner, ou les impôts supplémentaires qu'il faudrait lever.

Pour l'instant, j'avais les [données suivantes](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000025005833) :

- chômage	35 milliards / an
- APL	15 milliards / an
- familiales	53,5 milliards (moins 8 milliards déjà dans les APL)
- RSA	13,25 milliards

Il y a également les dépenses suivantes, que l'on peut inclure ou non selon sa sensibilité :

- retraites/vieillesse	194,1 milliards 
- maladie	176,5 milliards + 12,6 accidents du travail (dont CMU	6 milliards)

Je n'ai pas réussi à trouver de données sur les coûts de gestion liés aux organismes sociaux (on pourrait tabler sur une réduction de 20% de ces coûts).

Dans tous les cas, on voit qu'il n'y a pas assez d'argent pour maintenir les transferts entre riches et pauvres. Il faudra donc revoir également les systèmes d'imposition et de cotisation (j'ai essayé de faire une liste exhaustive des prélèvements, mais c'est vraiment trop complexe).

Une autre solution consisterait à diminuer la base des personnes éligibles à l'AU. Par exemple en obligeant à un service civil, un lieu de résidence en France, la nationalité française, l'inscription sur les listes électorales, pas de fraude fiscale préalable, un casier judiciaire vide ou pas de condamnation en cours ...

And no you are not, Romania could have afforded to raise the minimum wage more when we had sustained 7~8% economic growth, but all we saw were minuscule increases. It's not discriminating against anyone, having a higher minimum wage is just another form of social justice to an extent.                
I don't understand your youth unemployment comment, it has no basis in reality, and it's a known fact that youth unemployment is high in developing countries or grows significantly when a country has economic issues.                 
                
Inflation has way more causes than just money supply. There are several views on inflation, but in Keynesian economics there is [Demand-pull inflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand-pull_inflation) which happens when demand for products increases (which in the end happens in time if people's wages increase), there's also the [Built-in Inflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built-in_inflation).            
How would Romania control wages? From my knowledge, unions have more control over wages, via negotiating with employers than the country, the only thing the government would control is the minimum wage and government worker wages.           
Your less competition remark I think is wrong, and the end effect will be the opposite, with competitiveness increasing. The minimum wages is what the name states, the lowest common denominator, it's function is to raise the standard of living of the poorest employed. I think wages rising increase competitiveness.              
          
You are greatly exaggerating to make your point seem valid, and you are wrong, no economy can suddenly increase it's minimum wages from 150 euros to 2000 euros / month, it has to be done in time (I said ""accelerated increase of the minimum wage"" in my previoius comment).

true,chiwawa_42,null,null,"Je crois qu'il y a quelques trucs à préciser. Déjà, il y a trois approches différentes et complémentaires :

* Allocation universelle : c'est avant tout une simplification globale du système de protection sociale par répartition. L'application simple et stricte du principe d'équité permet d'abaisser significativement les coûts de gestion de cette répartition.

* Dividende universel : il est basé sur l'accroissement juste de masse monétaire et sa redistribution équitable, sur un principe déjà expérimenté avec certaines monnaies locales complémentaires. Il est très bien expliqué dans l'ouvrage traitant de la théorie relativiste de la monnaie ([disponible gratuitement là](http://wiki.creationmonetaire.info/images/f/f8/TRM_2_718_b.pdf))

* Revenu de base ou revenu d’existence : c'est une extension logique de l'allocation universelle complétée par le dividende universel. Il est justifié par le fait que la richesse d'une société doit être partagée équitablement entre tous les êtres humains composant cette société.

Il y a plusieurs problèmes dans la mise en place d'une telle mesure. Quelques exemples :

* L’extrême simplicité du dispositif de répartition rendrait inutile une bonne partie des administrations chargées de la gestion des trop nombreux dispositifs d'aide sociale existant actuellement. Ce serait donc synonyme de réduction d'effectifs des services publics

* Le principe d'équité absolue entre en opposition avec un système méritoire comme celui de l'allocation chômage. On ne permettrait pas à quelqu'un en période de chômage de maintenir un niveau de vie équivalent à celui dont il jouissait grâce au salariat. D'un coté, on peut estimer que ce serait plus incitatif pour qui tient à un certain niveau de vie.

* La France, comme tous les pays européens, a perdu son pouvoir régalien de création monétaire par la signature du traité de Maastricht. Ce pouvoir est désormais détenu par les banques privées, qui créent la masse monétaire de la zone euro par le crédit. Ce système est fondamentalement voué à sa propre destruction puisque l'intérêt d'une dette contracté devrait être payé par une masse monétaire supérieure à celle déjà émise par crédit : c'est le principe d'asservissement total des états aux banques par le jeu de la dette publique. Ainsi, sans être résolu à ce que l’État reprenne le contrôle de ce pouvoir, il est impossible d'instaurer le dividende universel, et donc de financer un revenu de base à une hauteur suffisante pour qu'il excède le seuil de pauvreté.

* Bien que fondamentalement équitable, ce système mixte (à dividende universel et à répartition) est taxé d'encouragement à l'oisiveté. Il est entendu que tous resteront libres de chercher à travailler pour accroitre leurs revenus, mais alors on aurait à modifier radicalement les règles établies (code du travail), en supprimant la plupart des dispositions protectrices envers les salariés, attendu que l'existence du revenu de base supprimerait toute notion de précarité. On passerait donc par la suppression du CDI et du salaire minimal, ouvrant la voie à un système très libéral ou les entreprises auraient à proposer des salaires suffisamment attractifs pour disposer de la main d’œuvre nécessaire à leur activité.

Deux obstacles majeurs à ça : premièrement nos syndicats sont trop archaïques pour laisser passer ça sans y voir l'intérêt à long terme, et surtout secundo : les politiques publiques étant actuellement tenues par les plus riches, à savoir ceux qui accumulent le capital, autant sous forme inerte que sous forme d'outil productif, ceux-ci souhaitent avant tout disposer de main d’œuvre bon marché et servile, afin de simplifier la gestion des entreprises de production industrielle et maintenir un bon niveau de compétitivité. Le risque étant grand de voir de fortes disparités apparaitre dans les rémunérations des ouvriers de certaines branches, et donc de créer au moins temporairement un gros déficit de main d’œuvre, risquant de fragiliser nos industries, au moins pendant le temps nécessaire à la stabilisation du nouvel équilibre économique ainsi crée, l'hypothèse leur fait peur.

En gros, le préalable nécessaire à la mise en place d'un revenu de base passe par les étapes suivantes :

* Sortie de l'euro

* Effacement de la dette publique (qui n'est en réalité constituée que des intérêts qui n'ont aucune légitimité)

* Sans aller jusqu'à la nationalisation, au moins la redistribution des capitaux productifs aux salariés (transformation des entreprises en coopératives)

* Réformes éducatives visant à réaffirmer certaines valeurs dans l'inconscient collectif (pour laminer le culte de la médiocrité et de l'oisiveté actuellement véhiculé par les médias d’abrutissement des masses).

A bag of chips (crisps), coke, milk and obviously beer are very cheap in Germany. But fresh meat (horse/beef or chicken), fruit/vegetables are about the same price in euros as aussie dollars.

Electronics also differ a lot. Computer components (video cards/hard drives etc) are more expensive due to the sales tax (19%? vs 10% in Aus). Things like TVs can vary a lot in Australia because big stores have to buy a lot of them and if they don't sell soon the new model comes in and they are fucked (this is a problem in Australia because of the small market and isolated location). Rent is also high so at some stores it adds a significant amount to the price.


A lot of price differences are perfectly understandable. I don't expect a mango to be as good or as cheap in Hamburg as in Brisbane.

The other thing is the ""Financial Equalisation Scheme between the German Länder"", or ""Länderfinanzausgleich"".
