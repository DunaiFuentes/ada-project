The Yes Scotland campaign cannot use that fallacy for themselves. Independence would mean change by definition, and that would be unpredictable.

&gt; Most innovation is not done by research institutes and national laboratories. It comes from manufacturing—from companies that want to extend their product reach, improve their costs, **increase their returns**. What’s very important is in-house research. Innovation usually arises from somebody taking a product already in production and making it better: better glass, better aluminum, a better chip. Innovation always starts with a product.

Okay. My highlighting. *Innovate to sell more* is different to innovate to really achieve a breakthrough or, most of all, get rid of some old (but most likely still well selling) things. So I agree that innovation is driven by the industry too, but that very same industry has a focus on beating the competition and reaching a monopole. And we haven't talked about patents yet, have we?

**Simple R&amp;D is not basic research** and if research itself only is focused on increasing returns, some paths will never be used while others may be left out intentionally. I think there was an example on where the folks researching lasers had their budget cut because it didn't seem profitable to continue. Glad they had more scientific ideals. Now an industry currently trying to patent genes and, only because of this, running research, is different to those ideals. I guess we agree on that.

The author on outsourcing. Actually, it should be *risk-sharing*.

&gt; Look at the crown jewel of Boeing now, the 787 Dreamliner. The plane had so many problems—it was like three years late. And why? **Because large parts of it were subcontracted around the world. The 787 is not a plane made in the USA**; it’s a plane assembled in the USA. They subcontracted composite materials to Italians and batteries to the Japanese, and the batteries started to burn in-flight. The quality control is not there.

Pretty rough look at things, especially in regard to the official report, clearing the battery manufacturer ([press article](http://www.usmarketsdaily.com/factories-of-dreamliner-battery-manufacturer-get-clearance-from-japanese-regulators-1516)). I agree again, quality control is important. I don't agree that ""quality control in the USA"" automatically establishes a superior position and I also don't think that the risk-sharing approach is doomed by design. He left out how modern development has to be financed by the way, that sharing therefore has a very clear purpose.

&gt; *Restoring manufacturing would mean training Americans again to build things.*

&gt; Only two countries have done this well: Germany and Switzerland. They’ve both maintained strong manufacturing sectors and they share a key thing: Kids go into apprentice programs at age 14 or 15. **You spend a few years, depending on the skill, and you can make BMWs.** And because you started young and learned from the older people, your products can’t be matched in quality. This is where it all starts.

Seems easy to build BMWs, huh? But taking a rude approach: My guess would be that China has a strong manufacturing sector, or any other country the first world picked for producing masses of products. As for Germany and the BMW example, they actually serve as an example of a strong drive to *automate* manufacturing. A [benchmark in the eyes of e.g. Boeing](http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2013/11/06/boeing-planning-for-more-robots-for.html?page=all). 

Now if people learn how to operate and design robots, that's a skill. But since he denied that any IT skill is valuable (and you need those on the design and maintenance part) and can easily be outsourced, I wonder what he thinks ""manufacturing"" should look like in a world where we have the skills and the knowledge to actually free us from the need to have human workers at assembly-lines. The only thing keeping them there is their low cost in regard to current robots. Even the shipping costs don't add enough. Now that's an issue the capitalistic setup has to solve. If it wants.

By this, preaching that workers have to return to assembly lines and then are able to solve the case for the middle class may not only look rather naive but also very backwards. **Why not improve our look on why and how somebody actually has to work?** We don't need to create hard work for people only being able to work hard, we should actually evolve and the middle class, same as the other classes, can join in.

I agree that there still is a large scope for people enjoying to offer customised and high quality products and services. And I also agree that the human interaction has its place in a modern setup. But why on Earth would I want humans to work in places where the conditions harm their health for the sake of mass producing goods with very limited life span (by design, because they want to sell the next thing soon)?

true,[deleted],null,null,"   You're assuming that if not for the latest crisis global growth would have gone on. It wouldn't have. The boom-bust cycle follows trends in product and technological innovation and the opening of new markets or resource fields. The housing crisis was an attempt by the financial market to maintain acceleration while the global economy stagnated. 

Also, you're assuming supply and demand does not apply to the workforce, when it does and always has. Population growth which outpaces economic growth is common and leads to internal strife, following the same pattern of boom-bust (growth during good times, shrinkage during bad times). The opposite also happens, see the blag plague and its effect on the rights of serfs.Historically, population changes mean a change in wages depending where people are needed most. The attempt to stifle the effect of population on wages has lead to the development  of guilds, unions and even national conscription. 

Automation has had an impact on all of this because it has allowed a consumerist society, where products are cheap enough to allow for mass consumption and mass-production, thus assuring steady careers to workers(work used to be far more piecemeal). It also allowed the development of new products and new markets for them, thus expanding demand for jobs. But it works by constantly destroying old types of work and old markets. 

Where I'm getting at is, ultimately, automation destroys jobs but allows by virtue of its efficiency the creation of new markets, but this relies on selling to people who already have wealth (jobs). Since we have a shrinking percentage of people who need employment for any one type of product, clearly the need is to make increasingly more types products and services. Depending on wealth distribution and human need, this might not always be possible. Thus a good long term solution for the community, is lowering workforce numbers to avoid too fierce a competition, since while the number of jobs might now be fixed, the number of unemployed might be controlled and allow for better negotiation of salaries, which in turn would spur consumer demand.

note: In case you're wondering I would advocate heavier taxation and the creation of large projects to increase workforce demand. But current neoliberal tendencies prevent much ground on that.

edit: I guess citation would be useful. I guess Adams Smith Wealth of Nations and any writing on serfdom after the black death would be a start. The various boom-bust cycles have to be read piecemeal in national history books, but they are difficult to make out because of the intervention of politics and ideology in the narrative.

Except that you are full of crap:

Average visibility range with high beams at 2am: 120 to **max 200m**.

[Overall stopping distance](http://www.fahrschule-123.de/formeln/anhalteweg/) at 300km/h: **540m** with an emergency break maneuver.


Which, not only makes going 300km/h on a Tuesday night insane but also illegal, even on the German Autobahn.

You'd be in direct violation of §3.1 StVO and you'd be disregarding everything you should have learned when acquiring Germany's terribly expensive driver's license.

You obviously don't given your first comment and this comment.

&gt;Now, the campaign for the initiative was vulgarized because NOT everyone understand the concept of shareholders and the redistribution of benefit. That's why I said the boss ""get all of it"".

Even with that redefinition, you're still wrong. The boss doesn't get ""all of it"". The owners of the company get what's left over after paying wages, capital expenses, and interest on loans.

&gt;Most of the great corporations have been running for a long time and their ceo's have changed either through heritage, shareholder right or very often financial corrupt schemes like an ""opa"" if you know what that is.

And? Do you think it shouldn't be possible to will one's equity in a company to one's heirs?

&gt;Now to get to your quote, no one agreed on the salary, its either that or gtfo.

Yes, that's the option: agree to the salary offered or find employment elsewhere. That's a fully consensual process.

&gt;In fact this initiative should have been a reset button for the low salaries. Boss salary keeps rocketing up while ours are almost falling down. 

And why is that necessarily a good thing? How are you harmed when someone makes more money than you?

&gt;The only effect it has, the company doesnt loose money, it redistributes it inside of itself more equally without affecting the financial health of the company.


If you're forcing a company to increase the salaries of its employees you are by definition forcing it to lose money.

&gt;If you dont understand that, you should NOT talk Against the initiative. People like you have been LYING since the begginig and that's why it didnt pass.

Jovanotti, musicalmente parlando, non è un cantante, nel senso che non sa coprire più di 3 note. Mia nonna ha una estensione tonale pari almeno al triplo di Jovanotti. 
A livello di testi ne ha scritti/cantati 500 credo: di questi, il 95% è incolore, il restante 5% merita al massimo una citazione su facebook. I cantautori veri onestamente sono altri. 
La sua storia, inoltre, è assurda: è uno di quelli che si è ritrovato a fare il cantante senza volerlo. Jovanotti è un'opera di Cecchetto, e solo successivamente ha preso una sua ""dimensione"". Se fosse partito con tale dimensione da solo, con le sue gambe, sarebbe miseramente rimasto fermo alle sagre di paese.

Rapidly growing or declining population is detrimental to economic growth. Status qou (birthrate of 2.1) is optimal for prosperity in my opinion.

And you're right, optimum is status quo, but I'm suggesting slight downwards trend to take the impact of what I would believe would be gains in human interaction technology, which might decimate the service industry. (I'm a believer in the eventual fully automated culture)

Problem is those better paid jobs become significantly less well paid if anyone can do them and there's a glut of people waiting for them. 

Ok, here's the simple premise i'm working on: While automation promotes consumer-career structure societies (you work daily for money by making products and services, you use money to pay for products and services needed/desired), it also hold within it the promise that you can make and buy more products with less work given time, tending towards 0 work for infinite products. The fact you can buy more products only holds true if your wage per hour keeps growing to compensate, in the current system. You can only negotiate increases in wage, if you're comfortable with not being outbid. Assuming there are no social safe-guards,high unemployment in your sector and assuming unemployment is undesirable, then you will see a drop or stagnation of wages in that specific role. Assuming there is no social safety-net or unemployment is undesirable, the consumer-career structure makes you dependent on accepting this to get employment and get needed products and services.

Illusion. Almost all Ukrainians understand Russian because of history.

But the most similar (in terms of common vocabulary) to Ukrainian is Belorussian (I never learned it, still understand 90+% of Belorussian texts). The next is Polish (Latin makes it much harder to read for usual Ukrainian), the next is Slovakian, and the next is Russian.

That's true, and that's what usually happens when one person prefers Ukrainian and another - Russian.

You're saying that the very fact that they have a specific social mechanism to deal with non-conformity is the common denominator. More specifically, dealing with dangerous non-conformism. Although again, i defend BNW  (it seems to need it), in that John got taken by official institutions only when he acted violently not when he espoused different views. The problem is as you say, John couldn't do much harm, because society was so stable. That is the point of BNW, non-conformism isn't a danger, it is hardly a thing. It a personal picadelio, at worst, and even the ostracism is light. Bernard mostly tortures himself. You keep judging BNW on how a person such as yourself would fit into it, but you couldn't and a person from BNW couldn't fit into your perfect world, you're two different creatures with different expectations. That's the point of the book, not on the dangers of non-conformity in it, but how alien it is to you. And there are societal norms which you yourself obey and find anyone breaking them absolutely repugnant, which I won't go into because they're taboo nature makes their repugnancy ""obvious"". (here's an example of such culture shock: http://lesswrong.com/lw/y5/)

I would state that the thing they have most in common is that they both repulse your senses. I highly doubt you're a ""de Sade"" level non-conformist, breaking rules as a moral code. You conform, or feel guilty or get punished. In 1984 this topic is underscored and circled, in BNW it's the opposite (conformity/non-conformity isn't even a thing, even the non-conformists have a place, but the plot requires something to happen, so we follow the fish out of water).

Also, your description of the dull life is something most people strive for and are currently attempting to live. A good predictable life which they can enjoy, lifelong careers, a sense that your work adds value to those around you,stable loves (who says you cannot love or hate). This is the American Dream and the Confucian ideal. A life worth living. 

It's not my cup of tea, but I understand it and sympathize with its followers, instead of painting them as souless drones. Not everyone sense of fulfillment has to have hints of misery and doubt.   

edit:Thinking about it, the main distinctive feature is that while in 1984 we see the life of a normal man being punished and assume this is a daily occurence, BNW has to find someone out of the ordinary to get the plot going.

Volo è famoso per scrivere romanzi pieni di citazioni random e storie banalotte, e quello è. Se invece Volo avesse fama di scrittore profondo, lì sarebbe sopravvalutato.

Il fatto che venda, beh, sappiamo che la quantità venduta non è indice di qualità. Magari alla gente piace leggersi una storia cretina per svagarsi, io Moccia lo lessi per svagarmi, così come Dan Brown.

Il problema è gente come De Carlo: io ho letto due suoi libri, ora sto leggendo un terzo, prestatimi dalla mia ragazza che ne è una grande fan. Ora spero non mi legga (ma se sì mi dispiace amore :D) ma il fatto che io non abbia mai sentito parlare male di De Carlo, come se ne dovrebbe parlar male, mi fa capire quanto sia sopravvalutato. Il fatto che lo chiamino come giudice a Masterpiece, mi fa capire quanto sia sopravvalutato (e la qualità del programma). Il fatto che solo su Amazon sono riuscito a trovare una recensione sensata, e questa era pure downvotata, mentre per gli tutti gli altri i personaggi di De Carlo sono profondi e ricchi di sfaccettature, mi fa capire quanto sia sopravvalutato.

Se io ho un certo segnale dall'esterno che non corrisponde alla mia valutazione sulla persona in questione (per eccesso dato che stiamo parlando di sopravvalutazione), è chiaro che c'è qualcosa che non va.

Ammaniti ha seguito una parabola che ora è nella sua fase di discesa a picco. *Io non ho paura* è un capolavoro, *Come Dio comanda* bello ma meno ispirato, *Che la festa cominci* divertente e aggressivo ma già si sente che la barca scricchiola. Già a *Io e te* qualcosa non va: un racconto breve stampato per forza come un romanzo perché è lui. L'ultima sua pubblicazione, *Il momento è delicato*, è un'antologia di suoi racconti precedenti. Niente di nuovo sotto al sole. Per me non sa più che cazzo scrivere ed è disperato.

*Ti prendo e ti porto via* l'ho messo a parte perché a me piacque molto, ma mio fratello, la cui opinione tengo in considerazione, lo ha trovato scialbo e pretestuoso, e a pensarci bene potrebbe avere ragione, tanto più che lo lessi da adolescente, quindi non so dirne nulla.",0,1385506653,null,0,1385507785,0,cdnr1zc,t3_1ri3rd,t1_cdnr1zc,t1_cdnitju,null,1428495380,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

Dei suoi albi solo il primo merita davvero di essere comprato, gli altri due, li avesse pubblicati senza la fama che lo precedeva, avrebbero floppato.

Lui comunque è una persona con un'attitudine molto umile, lo vedi nelle interviste e negli incontri che ha ancora l'aria da pischelletto imbarazzatissimo, quasi si scusa di stare lì al centro dell'attenzione.

true,EvilTwinCat,null,null,"&gt;La tua questione è equiparabile a dire che se una donna fa la prostituta e gli uomini la chiamano zoccola o puttana, questo rivela che la donna ha dei complessi.  

Ma cosa c'entra. Ci sono mille e una ragione per cui una donna (o un uomo) vuole interropere un rapporto sessuale che non sta dando piacere, in una relazione priva di manifestazioni di violenza fisica o psicologica non ha NULLA a che vedere col partner nella stragrande maggioranza dei casi. Quindi che un uomo si senta vittima di violenza esclusivamente perchè una donna vuole interrompere il sesso per ragioni sue e in un contesto di relazione che va bene è assolutamente grottesco. Mai ci si sognerebbe di andare da una donna e giustificarla nel piantare una filippica e disperarsi perchè si sente sminuita se ad un uomo non si rizza una volta ogni tanto. Dai eh. 
Donna ha male alla pancia e ferma il rapporto --&gt; uomo si sente triste e depresso e addirittura violentato. La donna ha agito con violenza? O è l'uomo a reagire in maniera sproporzionata? E chi è che deve esaminare i propri comportamenti, la donna che ha mal di pancia (ch dovrebbe fare, sopportare in silenzio?) o l'uomo che reagisce emotivamente ad una violenza che non c'è? Eccolo qua, il retaggio partiarcale. La donna non ha diritto ad avere mal di pancia o non essere eccitata, perchè il sesso non è un momento di amore/passione/divertimento tra due persone ma la copertina di linus che ristora l'ego maschile. Oh, lei non se la sente? E' perchè è stronza e mi vuole far soffrire. E secondo te questo è un comportamento che deve essere legittimato e considerato violenza sessuale da parte della donna? Ma siamo proprio nella twilight zone se devo fare sti discorsi cazzo.

They don't. The circumcision of infants seems to be pretty modern thing among most muslims.

But under last few decades infant circumcision has become more common for some reason (medicalization? wahhabism?).

&gt; just the Jews and even then it's not very common

I don't know how common the penis-sucking part (metzitzah b’peh) actually is but apparently the Chief Rabbinate of Israel deems it as important part of the ritual circumcision: [Israel’s Chief Rabbinate backs metzitzah b’peh rite for bris](http://www.jta.org/2013/04/24/news-opinion/world/israels-chief-rabbinate-backs-metzitzah-bpeh-rite-for-bris)

There has been controversies over the rite because it's unhygienic and has caused infections. One Israeli study estimated that about a third of neonatal herpes infections were due to the practice, and it has caused even deaths in New York:
*""In New York, at least 11 boys contracted herpes from the practice between 2004 and 2011, according to New York City health officials. Two died from the virus and two others suffered brain damage.""*

 Avec 

-le développement des nouvelles technologies, la multiplication des plateformes d'informations, la rapidité avec laquelle on passe d'un sujet à un autre et dont on les fragmente ou au contraire on les mélange sans que cela n'ait de sens;

-l'agressivité grandissante les uns envers les autres, les attaques sur la forme et non sur le fond, le manque d'écoute, le cynisme, le défaitisme. Et d'autre part le politiquement correct, la démagogie des invités en promo qui n'osent pas dépasser les ""bornes"", se mouiller ou assumer leurs opinions;

-Le bipartisme politique alors que l'écart PS UMP s'atténue et qu'on a bien glissé à droite;

..... etc

Une des dernières figures qui semble avoir fait consensus quel que soit l'âge, les convictions et autres ""clivages"" est par exemple Stéphane Hessel. Or j'ai l'impression que si on l'a vraiment écouté en mettant en sourdine les critiques (peut être bien justifiées, mais qui ne devraient pas je pense occulter le fond de ce qu'il avait avait à dire) c'est qu'il était un vieil homme tout à fait respectable, à l'histoire forte. En bref on n'avait pas grand chose sur quoi l'attaquer sans passer pour un gros con.

Mais bon là c'était une parole très politique, assez fédératrice. Sous Sarkozy on a eu pas mal de gens qui ont redonné un peu de souffle au débat sociétal, qu'on les aime ou pas au moins ça changeait. Par exemple Guillon: depuis je trouve qu'il a tourné un peu con. Autres exemples qui me viennent comme ça: Luchini et ses sorties théâtrales: maintenant c'est du vu et revu, le mec tourne en boucle sur les mêmes sujets à chaque fois, comme un vieux prof de fac monomaniaque qui a fait sa thèse sur Céline et ne parle que de ça, et fait son coming out à droite. Joey Starr venait souvent chez Ardisson et disait cash pas mal de choses: on ne le voit plus et il n'a pas de successeur dans le rap (euphémisme). Les activistes de toutes sortes sont souvent méprisés par les médias...

Je vous donne quand même un exemple de type qui m'épate toujours à chaque fois que je lis ou vois une interview: Taddéi. Même s'il ne se prononce pas sur le fond des sujets, je trouve que sa manière de penser est toujours spot on, j'en sors toujours moins con, et ""apaisé"".

Circumcision is a barbaric practice. Potential health benefits do not outweigh the risks, and nobody has the right to chop off a part of an infant's body. You should not be allowed to permanently damage someone who can't consent. I'm amazed that this sort of thing is legal.

And no, I'm not just talking about African countries that stone gays.  See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision

&gt;The positions of the world's major medical organizations range from considering neonatal circumcision as having a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks to viewing it as having no benefit and significant risks. No major medical organization recommends either universal circumcision for all infant males (aside from the recommendations of the World Health Organization for parts of Africa), or banning the procedure. Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and autonomy have been raised over non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision.

&gt;A 2009 Cochrane meta-analysis of studies done on sexually active men in Africa found that circumcision reduces the infection rate of HIV among heterosexual men by 38–66% over a period of 24 months. The WHO recommends considering circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV program in areas with high endemic rates of HIV, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where studies have concluded it is cost-effective against HIV. Circumcision reduces the incidence of HSV-2 infections by 28%, and is associated with reduced oncogenic HPV prevalence and a reduced risk of both UTIs and penile cancer, but routine circumcision is not justified for the prevention of those conditions. Studies of its protective effects against other sexually transmitted infections have been inconclusive. A 2010 review of literature worldwide found circumcisions performed by medical providers to have a median complication rate of 1.5% for newborns and 6% for older children, with few severe complications. Bleeding, infection and the removal of either too much or too little foreskin are the most common complications cited.

In South Korea virtually no circumcisions were performed before 1945 as it was in fact against their Confucian traditions. The practice was exported over there by American soldiers. After that boys have been circumcised most often in their preteens but now according to study [Decline in male circumcision in South Korea](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/1067) the practice is in steep decline and the according to the study the *""cause for this decline seems to be the increase in information available on the pros and cons of circumcision.""*

So could you please provide recent data regarding the rate of *infant circumcision* in your listed countries, please? Relevant data being the percentage of infant boys that are currently circumcised. I don't think it is common at all in many of them - except in the US.

On that basis, it wouldn't be out of order to be able to make a judgement about the sexuality of those in the pictures. My judgement: not a single 'mo in sight. 

What's also telling is the way they seem reticent to have their pictures taken with the rainbow flags.

Here in Canada we have a really high immigrant population which more or less balances out the low birth rate. And it's been very, very successful.

What's key is that we give preference to educated and skilled people and we provide free English or French lessons.

Academically oriented students went to gymnasium, with the expectation of going on to university after that. Students not choosing that track (the majority, in earlier years) went to a vocationally oriented secondary education.

Manufacturing has nonetheless greatly declined, despite the existence of that educational pipeline, and a general high attention to quality. For example, although it survived longer than most others in the region, Maersk's last shipyard in Denmark was [closed in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odense_Steel_Shipyard), because it is simply no longer cost-effective to build ships in Denmark.

The attempt to go high-end has succeeded to some extent, such as with renewable energy technology. But that has gone *really* high-end, where the manufacturing itself is highly automated, and the jobs are mostly demanding people with a university education (engineering, etc.), only very few employees with a vocational education.

Vaclav Smil presented such a twisted thinking, although typical of people approaching problems from purely a classical economic standpoint: innovating only to increase profits. Companies thrive to reach dominant positions on markets, and after they've succeeded, it is not economical for them to push for disruptive innovation on that market, as it could cannibalize their own business. Instead, they only gradually increase the efficiency of their operation, only to grow the bottom line steadily, meanwhile, they try to hinder any threat to their business: competing products and services, especially those which are significantly better. This is so they can still 'milk the same cow' without having to invest in new ventures. And Smil considers *this* process innovation? After saying that ""Most innovation is not done by research institutes and national laboratories""? I'm now wondering what the word 'innovation' really means to people.

He considers jobs in IT ""totally fungible jobs"", but argues that jobs in manufacturing are not. Common sense tells me that jobs requiring more skills are probably less fungible. I think he exhibits some kind of ignorance towards IT. As a side note, when talking about Moore's law, he says ""There are limits [to the efficency of power plants]. It’s not a microchip."" While in fact chip manufacturers and designers struggle to keep up with Moore's law, and in this instance, much of the innovation is actually on the manufacturing process, to reduce the width of circuits to mere atoms. This is an argument he could've even used previously.

The idea that we should bring back manufacturing to developed countries with the aim of lifting the middle/lower class is absolutely backwards, as you said. It stands to reason that in developed countries people have more opportunities to learn more valuable skills, and through these people's intellectual work we can reduce the need for manual labour; because jobs in factories are replaceable by automation, while the jobs to innovate and implement such automation are not.

With all that said, I agree with the sentiment that the ""answers are not technological but political: better economic policies, better education, better trade policies"", and that we shouldn't ""Just wait for this innovation manna from a little group of people in Silicon Valley"". However, instead of fostering the conditions which produce menial jobs, we should focus on growing and extending that 'little group in Silicon Valley'. With modern democracies that are really just oligarchies, models of classical economics that evidently don't stand, and with the current system of education being a legacy from the Industrial Revolution, I don't think it's far-fetched to say we need an intellectual revolution to prosper.

Only humans in developed countries have a real chance to achieve this, so it would be a waste of intellect and opportunity to go back to the old age ideas of Smil's. We should give opportunities to grow the economies of developing countries by outsourcing jobs which don't require high skills, so these billions of people will eventually also have the chance to innovate with us -- when and if we're already there. Being the capitalist Bill Gates is, I can't blame him for advocating Mr. Smil's views, but I think we can agree that this writer is a dinosaur in our age, supporting ideas that won't hold in the future, as more and more highly skilled people enter the workforce.",0,1385535363,null,0,false,0,cdo191l,t3_1rhz4q,t1_cdo191l,t1_cdnmf41,null,1428490611,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

E' vero sotto molti punti di vista, ma c'è da dire che tutte le trasmissioni di cucina falliscono miseramente su un punto: le cose che presentano sono spesso irrealizzabili tra le mura domestiche in un qualsiasi mercoledì sera di Novembre con ciò che hai in frigo. Le altre trasmissioni fanno ricette per la domenica mezzogiorno dopo una spesa particolareggiata. Ci sono più lunedì, martedì e via di seguito che domeniche mezzogiorno. Ed è più facile avere in casa una carota che non del sedano rapa.

Chi è appassionato di cucina sa benissimo che un soffritto fatto con le verdure già sminuzzate e surgelate non è paragonabile a uno fatto con le verdure fresche, che la besciamella è molto meglio se te la fai tu dato che ci vogliono 3 minuti invece che comprare quella melma confezionata, etc, etc. 

Però ci sono milioni di italiani/e che tornano a casa alle 8 e devono mettere in tavola qualcosa. Io credo che la Parodi abbia centrato il punto: si può cucinare qualcosa di un livello un tantino più elevato dei maccheroni al sugo o della carbonara, in maniera comunque semplice e veloce. Non fa alta cucina ma credo che non abbia mai avuto intenzione di farla. E' l'unica in un settore sovraffollato fatto di gourmet, intenditori, buongustai ad essersi abbassata al livello di quello che c'è davvero dietro le nostre porte tutte le sere.

Tu ne vois que les barrières douanières, mais tu loupes l'essentiel : normes, marchés publics, subventions, propriété intellectuelle et brevets. Bienvenue dans le monde réel.

&gt;Le contournement de barrières douanières par réétiquetage d'origine, par exemple

C'est une fraude. Un pays n'a jamais intérêt à encourager la fraude.

Ta source ne montre rien du tout.

C'est l'exemple typique de réussite de mesures protectionnistes : 

- **On a tout d'abord un protectionnisme japonais bien connu** (vente cher sur le marché intérieur et sacrifice à l'extérieur pour gagner des parts de marché, dumping et unfair trade à leur apogée).

- les industriels locaux se plaignent à juste titre de cette concurrence déloyale et des sanctions sont prises bien légitimement

- les japonais sont obligés d'investir localement, puis leurs sous-traitants (au besoin avec des obligations de ""local content""), puis et savoir faire est exporté

Au passage, le protectionnisme japonais a permis l'émergence de géants dans l'informatique en forçant IBM, le leader de l’époque, à partager le marché et sa technologie avec des firmes locales telles que NEC, Hitachi et Fujitsu.

&gt;un ""retour au protectionnisme national""

[Les hauts-fourneaux sont rentables](http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2012/12/17/florange-la-non-rentabilite-des-hauts-fourneaux-contestee_1807302_3234.html). L'État y gagnerait donc en les reprenant.

Et tu repars à nouveau dans une spéculation. Quelle imagination ! Dommage pour toi. 

Les droits de douanes cibles seront de l'ordre de 6% dans certains secteurs. Et effectivement il s'agit de privilégier uniquement certaines industries et d'en laisser tomber d'autres. C'est exactement ce qu'il se passe aujourd'hui au niveau de l'Europe.

À nouveau : arrête de fantasmer sur des choses qui n'existent pas encore. Commence par argumenter sur ce qui se fait aujourd'hui, car le protectionnisme est tout à fait actuel.

**Quels sont les dégâts du protectionnisme européen ? Combien ça représente ? Pourquoi n'arrête-t-on pas ?**

&gt;accusant d'une part l'UE d'""ultralibéralisme""

Je parle plutôt de libre-échange mondialisé mais c'est effectivement proche : il s'agit de lutter contre la dérégulation et le nivellement par le bas des conditions sociales et fiscales qui ne profitent qu'aux grandes multinationales.

Je suis pour le protectionnisme en l'absence de régulation, pour le libre-échange lorsqu'il y a régulation. En particulier, régulation de la balance commerciale, de la monnaie, des conditions sociales de travail et des politiques fiscales.

Je ne fais que reprendre [le constat de Maurice Allais](http://allais.maurice.free.fr/Cliquer%20pour%20chargement.pdf) (page 13) :

*Une mondialisation généralisée des échanges entre des pays caractérisés par des
niveaux de salaires très différents aux cours des changes ne peut
qu 'entraîner finalement partout dans les pays développés : chômage, réduction de la
croissance, inégalités, misères de toutes sortes. Elle n'est ni inévitable, ni nécessaire,
ni souhaitable.*

Donc *Une libéralisation totale des échanges et des mouvements de capitaux n'est possible,
et elle n'est souhaitable que dans le cadre d'ensembles régionaux groupant des pays
économiquement et politiquement associés et de développement économique et social
comparable*.

Étant donné la concurrence de fait entre pays européens et l'influence américaine, je ne pense pas que l'Europe que tu espères soit possible tant qu'il n'y a pas de peuple européen.

&gt;comment fait la France pour trouver les meilleures taxes pour 101 départements aux intérêts différents aussi?

Elle compense les inégalités des régions par des politiques de redistribution massive en faveur des régions les plus pauvres. 

L'exemple de l'octroi de mer, que je connais bien ayant vécu plusieurs années en Martinique, montre au contraire que ça marche. C'est souligné dans [ce rapport](http://www.senat.fr/rap/l03-357/l03-35712.html) :

*Une suppression du différentiel d'octroi de mer empêcherait le secteur productif de trois des quatre DOM d'atteindre, de façon globale, le seuil de rentabilité économique*. (Le [résumé de J-J Vlody est éloquent](http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/pdf/cr-dom/12-13/c1213012.pdf))

That's all you need to know, this isn't magically not the case on the Autobahn. It's not just common sense, it's the law and one of the most important ones in the StVO.

And you can argue as much as you want about advances in break design - it matters very little:

Even you fanciest sport's car's high beams won't be able to properly light more than 200m of the highway on front of you at night.

At 300km/h you won't even start to break for 90m. You already agree that carbon breaks won't decelerate you from 300 to 0 in 100m, but rather about 300%-400% more than that. Any obstacle would be hit at a speed that would be deadly for everyone involved even under optimal circumstances.

And that's it, that's all there is to it: Going 300km/h at night on a German is both insane (you are risking yours and other people's lives) and illegal. There isn't much more to it.

So when you say:

&gt; Driving 300km/h is not batshit insane, depending on the circumstances. At 10am on a Friday? Yeah, I agree. At 2am on a Tuesday? No problem.

Then you are completely wrong and full of crap, it's really that simple.

I wasn't making any other arguments, I wasn't talking about more sensible speeds at night, like anything under 180km/h, I wasn't talking about daytime driving where I myself frequently and comfortably drive at 180km/h and higher.

Well, luckily we have people like you deciding what others should do with their money!

&gt;If those immigrants had the chance to get well educated and work experience in there home countries, why bother coming here?

So you admit that the majority of immigrants to Germany are poverty immigrants that want to reap the benefits of living in a rich country. It's not really hard to see why people are opposed to that, is it?

An immigrant, who has done nothing for society so far and who will likely incur more costs over the span of his life than he will produce benefits for the country, is probably not needed when you could instead let people immigrate, that have needed skills or certifications or at least a certain level of education.

Are you from Denmark? Danes are culturally quite similar to Germans, have a similar education level and will, for the most part, be model-immigrants.

The vast majority of immigrants from Eastern Europe and Islamic countries, who make up most of Germany immigrants today, will have a much poorer level of education and are culturally often quite different from Germans. Which makes proper integration very hard and very costly.

Other countries like the US, Australia and Canada have a much more rigorous immigration process that weeds out social welfare leeches and economic refugees. I'm very much in favor of similar and even more rigorous requirements for immigration in Germany.

&gt; What, now, do you think is the biggest difference between ""east"" and ""west"" germany?

**Economy:** The east-german economy suffered greatly after reunification. The east is still behind today, but catching up.

**Politics:** There a much greater support for the leftist former east-german state-party ""Die Linke"". This may be related to the fact that some (especially older) people still mourn things they feel were better ""in the old days"" (no unemployment, a greater sense of solidarity and communal spirit, family and job more easy to reconcile due to day care - especially for women, etc.).

**Population:** There was quite an exodus from the east to the west (especially among younger people AFAIK and especially in smaller towns and villages). The saying ""Der Letzte macht das Licht aus"" (~= ""The last one to leave, please switch the lights off"") pretty much sums up this sentiment, I think. Anyway, I heard or read recently that this exodus has pretty much stopped now.

The graphics linked by /u/Isek show some of this quite nicely.

&gt; What was the biggest struggle in the reunification of Germany after the Berlin Wall fell?

The east-german economy. Lots of industry was lost - partially because much of the east german industry was antiquated and therefore not able to compete, but  there was also quite a bit of mismanagement during the privatization AFAIR. Population loss, political differences and also neo-nazism in some parts of east germany can at least partially be attributed to the economic problems IMO.

&gt; Do you feel like Germany is still divided?

[Originally posted on Carnegie](http://carnegie.ru/2013/11/21/new-russia-policy-for-germany/gub8). ""More than any other European state, Germany is responsible for developing and implementing the EU’s policy toward Russia. Berlin needs to accept this responsibility, assume leadership, and develop a Russia policy fit for the twenty-first century."" 

Recommendations below:

&gt; •    Base the new policy on German and EU interests, principles, and practical needs as well as a realistic assessment of Russia rather than mere impressions of what the Russian people need or a desire to influence the country’s domestic politics.
&gt; 
&gt; •    Broaden people-to-people contacts with ordinary Russians to create social compatibility between Russia and the rest of Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; •    Demand, when necessary, that Russia live up to its formal obligations, in particular in the field of human rights, but also be prepared to deal constructively with Russia’s complaints and criticisms.
&gt; 
&gt; •    Expand mutually beneficial business ties with Russia but do not expect that such activities will suffice to modernize the country or make Russia and its Eurasian partners “EU-ropean.”
&gt; 
&gt; •    Lead the effort to deepen and widen the security community that essentially already exists between Germany and Russia so that it covers all of Europe and the Euro-Atlantic area.
&gt; 
&gt; •    Set clear policy goals and develop a long-term strategy toward Eastern Europe—in particular Ukraine—and make that policy fully transparent to Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; •    Treat Moscow’s promotion of Eurasian economic integration and security coordination as legitimate and stabilizing as long as this integration and coordination remain voluntary.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; It's illegal everywhere, 

FGM is not illegal everywhere. But it is illegal for example in Norway and the Nordic countries. AFAIK even a nip without permanent injury on a girl's genitals is illegal.

&gt; and still goes on a lot.

It happens somewhat to girls born in the Nordic countries, but it is getting rarer - although I haven't seen recent stats on it.

&gt;  I am not saying at all that it should be legalized, just that it isn't stopping anyone.

That applies to all laws, because laws are made of words. A law cannot prevent anyone from breaking it. 

The purpose of a law criminalizing an act is to give legal basis to prosecute for such acts, and to give legal protection for the victim who will then have the ability to report a crime and/or file charges.

For example: Criminalizing sexual assault does not prevent such acts from happening. They do happen and often out of sight. But only if the act is defined as a crime in a law can the victim report a crime and the assaulter be arrested, prosecuted and sentenced.

When the act of infant circumcision without medical justification is criminalized then the persons commiting such act can be prosecuted. Law enforcement and justice system can take action upon it. As a victim of a crime the child or someone on behalf of the child can report a crime and file charges against the suspected perpetrators (doc, parents). The victim gets protected. The perpetrator(s) gets prosecuted. That is the point of having such laws.

true,frere_de_la_cote,null,null,"Pour avoir vécu dans plusieurs pays Africains (Madagascar, Maroc et Ghana), je pense pouvoir apporter quelques éléments d'explications. Je ne garantis rien, mais je vais essayer de garder ça le plus objectif possible. Dans le cas présent, je vais me baser sur mon expérience a Madagascar et au Ghana.

Le gouvernement en place en Centrafrique (ou RCA) repose sur un équilibre plus ou moins stable entre les différents ethnies/tribus/clans locales. Celles-ci cohabitent plus ou moins paisiblement grâce à la poigne d'hommes forts, souvent des militaires ou ayant des militaires dans leur famille, qui sont capables d'imposer leur volonté. A l'heure actuelle, ~~le président Bozizé est au pouvoir, c'est le général qui avait mené le coup d'état de 2003.~~ le président Bozizé est plus ou moins en fuite à l'étranger depuis Mars.

La médiation internationale permet régulièrement (en 2003 et en 2013) de rétablir un équilibre à travers des accords entre les différentes factions. Le problème récurrent de ces accords (en RCA ou ailleurs) c'est qu'ils ne mettent pas souvent des hommes forts aux gouvernement ou alors conservent les mêmes en y rajoutant simplement quelques membres de l'opposition, et donc les manoeuvres politiques reprennent de plus belle.

Malheureusement, ces différents clans/factions ont souvent la violence facile. Donc quand une des factions déclare que ceux d'en face ne respectent pas les accords, ils n'hésitent pas à se mettre sur la gueule, pour parler franchement. C'est là que les distinctions qu'il peut y avoir entre clans et ethnies rentrent en jeux. A en croire wikipédia, il y a plus de 80 ethnies qui cohabitent en RCA. Les hommes de pouvoir d'un clan n'hésitent pas à lâcher les chiens sur les membres d'un autre clan, qu'ils soient homme, femme, ou enfant.

A mon sens, c'est là qu'intervient la France. On pourrait penser que c'est de l'interventionnisme, qu'on les empêche de tourner en rond. On pourrait aussi penser que cette intervention permet de protéger des populations innocentes. Faites votre opinion, mais ce n'est pas le lieu de cette tentative d'explication.

Un thème souvent exagéré mais néanmoins tout à fait réel c'est l'implication des compagnies étrangères dans l'économie locale. Possédant des ressources en diamant, uranium, or et bois, voir aussi en pétrole, le pays est intéressant. Le thème du complot qui met en place un homme fort disposé à accorder à une compagnie l'exploitation exclusive d'une ressource quelconque sera surement évoqué. A mon sens, l'influence de ces compagnies est surfaite, mais je ne m'y connais pas assez pour en parler de façon crédible, c'est juste une intuition. Dans la même veine, l'intervention de la France pourrait aussi être une façon de sécuriser l'approvisionnement en uranium, suites au [problèmes qu'a eu Areva au Niger](http://www.courrierinternational.com/article/2007/08/09/l-affaire-areva-ou-la-fin-du-monopole-francais-sur-l-uranium-nigerien). Mais ce n'est que spéculation de ma part.

Finalement, un dernier point sur les sources d'instabilité constante de la région. Je vais probablement pas me faire apprécier en disant ça, mais les pays subsahariens ""subissent"" une islamisation croissante venue du nord. En soi, pourquoi pas, on pourrait y voir une simple évolution de la société. Malheureusement, cette islamisation se fait parfois de façon violente, suite aux mouvements de populations comme la fuite de perdants des différentes zones de guerre (Mali, Soudan, Nigéria etc), ou encore aux différentes sectes islamiques voulant imposer leur vision de la religion. Avant de me tirer dessus, laissez-moi juste dire que j'ai bien conscience que c'est une vision très simpliste de la situation, j'essaye simplement d'expliquer d'où vient cette instabilité perpétuelle. L'intervention étrangère serait hypothétiquement une façon de mettre court aux violences de ces populations, comme au Kosovo.

Bon, je crois que je vais m'arrêter là pour le mur de texte, j'espère avoir pu apporter quelques éléments de réponse sur la situation en Centrafrique, ainsi que qu'une vision simpliste des tenants et aboutissants. Si ça aboutit sur une discussion, essayons de rester civil...

The biggest struggle was to get the eastern economy running again, I guess.

The question wether Germany is still divided is difficult to answer... I guess ""not really"" would be a fitting answer.

We are a very regional people, as Germany as a nation is very very young compared to others. Regional differences in language, culture and mind set seem huge to me. 

My circle of colleagues and friends is full of people from the former east, mainly Brandenburg. Of course I pick on them and make rude jokes, but the overall attitude is positive. 

With people from southern Germany, the picking is more serious and the playful animosity feels considerably more serious. 

So instead of speaking of ""divsion"" I would speak of ""additional diversity""

Although there is a certain important shared aspect of western Germany that the East does not really share and that is,  I think, the formative cultural process during the 68'er student revolts. These people asked several questions about social norms and captialism and stuff, but the point that is important here I think is the questions they asked about the third reich and the responsibility of the war generation and how militarism and nationalism and even patriotism are a bad thing. I think in the eastern part of Germany, people are less reserved about these things.

true,TechnicalSaturn,UNSA,United States of America,"To be blunt, I think you are overstating the contribution of most European states to Western civilization.  Admittedly, there were a lot of contributions made by a few large states (France, UK, Germany, etc.)  Most Americans managed to label these correctly on the map.  The ones they had the most trouble with were the newest and smallest states, particularly in Eastern Europe.  A lot of these countries actually have much shorter histories than most US states because they only formed recently when larger countries broke down for various reasons.  The Balkan states in particular appeared very recently, a lot of them don't have a historical antecedent (like Poland or Lithuania after WWI/ the USSR respectively), and to be honest, I cannot name many contributions to ""Western culture"" originating from that region off top of my head.  

I think you have an unwarranted sense of self importance if you think that people living a quarter of the globe away need to be able to place a country like Slovenia on the map.  It has a trivial population compared to most US states, a trivial GDP compared to most states, and if we were to cherry pick contributions from the last 300 years, I bet the argument could be made that most US states have contributed more to ""Western civilization.""  There are quite a few states in Europe that even a relatively well educated American would have trouble placing simply because they have no real history to have learned about, do not and have never had any political clout on a global scale, have tiny economies, and produce very little scientific research.  Just because they happen to be in Europe near relevant countries doesn't suddenly elevate them to a higher importance than the multitude of similarly small African, Asian, and Latin American countries which I am sure the majority of people in the world would have difficulty locating.",0,1385562488,null,0,false,0,cdo60je,t3_1rk7r2,t1_cdo60je,t1_cdo3twz,null,1428488319,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The 4 people you replied to might be happy that you replied to them but the 40 people that read the thread will be incredibly annoyed if you just spam the same comment.

What you should do as well is keep your comments clean. Don't reply twice. Edit your comment instead. That means that everything important is in one comment.

If you want to make people aware about your edit, you should just write them a short pm with the permanent link to your edited comment.

Though, it's not really that important most of the time. 

Let's say you've got a comment in a big thread about something interesting and you say ""I'll look it up when I come home since I'm at work right now"" and then 20 people tell you ""oh damn I'd love to read what you found out"".

Instead of replying with the same comment to 20 people, you edit your initial comment and then tell the people (either per PM or reply. In big threads, you can just reply. In smaller threads, I'd write a PM just to keep the thread clean) that you edited your comment.

Though, in general, just an edit without notice is fine. 

So what you should have done in this situation is putting your statistics in your initial post. Then, **if** you notice that somebody is actually confused or misinformed, you can tell him or her ""hey, I edited my initial post. Take a look at it"". If you see that everyone is confused, I'd write a PM just to make sure you don't have ""hey, I edited my initial post. Take a look at it"" multiple times as a comment in the thread.

Also, it makes sense to click the formatting help button next to the text box. For example, you could easily highlight the statistic as a quote if you put a &gt; in front of it.

&gt; it looks like this then

You should also know that one new line is ignored. So if you want to start a new paragraph or want to write below the quote, you should hit enter twice

&gt; that looks weird
because I hit enter once

But this doesn't look weird

&gt; because I hit

Enter twice.

You also have to put some other text between two quotes because they're otherwise merged together.

If you want to make a simple new line, just put two spaces at the end of a line

First Line!
Only pressed enter once without extra spaces so it looks weird and it not a proper new line

First line!  
That doesn't look weird because I put two spaces at the end of the last line

Also, lists are quite nice.

\* first point  
\* second point  
\* third point

Looks like this

* first point
* second point
* third point

Now, what do you do if you want to put a * somewhere without it becoming a list? You put a \ in front of it. \ is the escape character which means that the character after that is treated as the actual character and not as an indicator for a list or something.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; **If** the idea of the EU emerged as a way to ensure peace between the traditional enemies of France and Germany with the European Coal and Steel Community (and you could even go further back for ideas related to a broader European community) in the 1950s, I'm curious as to whether the application of an idea meant for such a specific region can continue growing unabated?

I bolded the operative word. The ECSC between Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was the first supranational organ, one practical implementation of an idea, one aspect of it. That does not mean it's all there was to it. For example already in 1946 Churchill in [his speech](http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/astonish.html) called for 'a kind of United States of Europe'.

Certainly tying the economies together, especially between traditional rival countries, was and still is (e.g. €) an important part of ensuring peace. But it is not all there is to European integration, and treating it as such can lead to an incomplete analysis.

&gt; In this way, I'm quite interested in the idea that distributing wealth can be satisfactorily done **at a national level** without consideration of rural-urban dynamics, disparate economy types (dominantly fishing versus industry), etc. Incidentally, this was one of the controversies over the accession of Croatia in the summer--most benefits would be experienced by those in the coastal regions and not in places like Vukovar in the east.

The operative part bolded. National level policies are the most important part of distributing benefits and wealth between regions in a member state, and it is mostly up to Croatia how its different regions will benefit of the EU membership. The EU will provide funding for regional development through mechanisms such as Cohesion funding and CAP.

true,Bob_Fucking_Ross,UNSA,United States,"I obviously can't speak for the European side of the argument here.

My personal experience on World History in school was very limited in terms of time length.  My high school world history class essentially played on the parts of world history which impacted the formation and current state of the USA.  Aside from that, there was not a whole lot of delving into the intricacies of European history.  Hell, I didn't even know what Bavaria actually was until I went there this summer (I'm 26).

The average USAmerican can, of course, pick out where European countries like England, Germany, France, Italy are, but it's essentially the same as how the average European could (I believe) place New York, Florida, California, Texas.

I understand how people are arguing the history, significance, and sovereignty of European countries over what our individual states have, but that means ~~nothing~~ *less* to a lot of us here in the USA.  There's only so much history you have time to learn in a classroom here (and our classrooms generally have a lot of improvement they could do), so learning our own ~237 years of history and knowing our own states is quite a higher priority than learning the ~~countries~~ *thousands of years of history* of Europe and the many countries which comprise the continent.

You'd know you're in Ireland by the accent and the fair amount of catholicism and you'd know you're in England by the accent.

I see what you're trying to say - culturally the british isles aren't that different in a lot of aspects. But they are infinitely more diverse than the United States where you could drive for 500 miles and not hear a different accent. In the british isles you could drvie for 30 minutes and hear a different accent. 

I'd totally respect you're opinion but the world reknown for Scotland, Ireland or England is largely as big as America. If you were in the depths of South East Asia and you said one of those 4 countries (Leprechauns/guiness, kilts and bagpipes, the monarcchy and tea, cowboys and indians) they'd likely have one equally strong image attached to those 4 so sorry the comparison is not as worthy as comparing states in America who are frankly only reknowned for the produce they farm

That isn't entirely true though. Certainly not for Europe. 

For example Greece many years ago democratically voted in the communist party. This lead to a CIA backed Junta to overthrow the government. 

Or the UK British Leyland that was shipping buses to Cuba against the wishes of America. There is documentation that the CIA orchestrated the \*accident\* of the transport ship. 

&gt; Also, American blood has been spilled fighting the Chinese,

Well in the case of the example of Greece above, a lot of American civilians were killed due to fallout from the student protest in Greece (troops killed the students, students set up terrorist group to kill Americans). 

Let's not forget many Russians died helping to end WWII. Plus the cold war kicked off, not because of Russian expansionism, but because the Russians were finally able to shoot down a US spy plane which had been flying over Russia for some time without permission. 

Even the Cuba mess could have been averted if the US president hadn't told Castro on live TV that Golf was more important then meeting him to discuss resolving the friction.

And he does the same in the other blogpost you just linked. He creates subsets favourable to his point. He composes and then compares subsets ""Western Europe"" and ""Eastern Europe"" to the *whole* Russian Federation. And totally forgets that the EU population is actually growing. That is flawed analysis.

Simple rule of thumb in statistics: 
It is always possible to cherrypick such a subset that when compared to another whole, the comparison may appear favourable to your point or agenda. The reader should always be cautious when someone presents subsets.

In reality the population growth rate in the EU is positive, and bigger than in Russia where it's negative.

true,Futski,DENK,Kongeriget Danmark,"1864*, 1870 was the Franco-Prussian war.

Not to be a buzzkill, but I don't think we could have claimed any kind of territory by winning that war, as it was about cracking down a rebellion in Holstein and Southern Schleswig. 

And well, beating them and the Austrians would be a hard task, especially since the breech-loaded Dreyse Needle rifle had been adopted in the Prussian Army between the First and the Second Schleswig War, while the Danish Army still relied on muzzle-loaders.

We had equipment and manpower against us, the Germans outnumbered the Danish forces 2:1. The Danish Army consisted of about 40000 men, 50000 would have been needed to defend Dannevirke properly. Dannevirke itself had been neglected, and therefore wasn't the impregnable fortress it was made up to be in the Danish minds. 

Dannevirke held somekind of almost mythical powers in the minds of the Danish people in the era, and General de Meza, who was the Commander of the Danish forces in the war, was sacked for abandoning Dannevirke and retreating to Dybbøl. In retrospect, this act has been deemed an act of brilliance from de Meza's side, since the army was almost unscathed when it reached Dybbøl, and because Dannevirke would have been overrun, which would have resulted in huge losses for the Danish side.

**But to go on with your what if scenario.**

If I were to be sent back to 1850 or so, as military advisor to the Danish government, and breech-loaders had been adopted in the army, Dannevirke had received the necessary maintanence along with upgrades, and Sweden had sent that expeditionary force, the Swedish king had promised, the Danish forces might have held off the Austro-Prussian invasion. 

I still don't think we would have had the capability to take the war to the other German territories. And even if we could, I don't think the Danish government would have wanted to annex more German lands, Schleswig-Holstein and Lauenburg made more than enough trouble(2 large-scale rebellions within 16 years). More nationalist Germans wouldn't make that situation easier. 

What I do think could have happened though, is that Denmark, Norway and Sweden could have formed a closer political union back then. Scandinavism had its heyday between 1840 or so and then until 1864, where the Swedish government refused to support the Danish army with that expeditionary force mentioned earlier. Had those soldiers been sent, the Pan-Scandinavian movement wouldn't have suffered such a terrible blow, and would possibly had continued to gain more and more influence.

[This is a painting shows Danish soldiers returning to Copenhagen in 1849](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Tropper_1849.jpg) during the First Schleswig War, where you can see Danish flags, Swedish union flags and Norwegian union flags.

So we might not have gained any German territory, but maybe Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Iceland would have been united as a single country.",0,1385569646,null,0,false,0,cdo8gza,t3_1rk7r2,t1_cdo8gza,t1_cdo4gm2,null,1428487172,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,TechnicalSaturn,UNSA,United States of America,"I would argue that Virginia is at least as important as Portugal.  For one, it had an incredibly important role in the American Revolution.  Without such visionaries as Jefferson and Washington, the colonies may not have been able to break away at all.  As far as world influence, I literally cannot even imagine what the world would now look like if Great Britain had retained its American colonies.  Similarly, another Virginian, Woodrow Wilson, was the US president during WWI.  Though unsuccessful at the time, his efforts at creating the League of Nations can still be felt today through the eventual creation of the UN.

Second, early Virginians are often credited with having advanced Western political thought.  While democracy is a quintessential characteristic of Western civilization today, it is easy to forget that most of Europe was under some form of despotism until the 20th century and most of the continent slide back into it in the middle of the century as well.  The Virginia Declaration of Rights was a groundbreaking document that influenced the US Bill of Rights through its guarantee of basic rights for all men regardless of class.  Similarly, the Constitution and Declaration of Independence were both strongly influenced by Virginian delegates. Actually, quite a few of the cornerstones of Western political thought such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, equality under the law, and a government representative of and working for the common man were espoused by Virginian writers such as Jefferson and Adams.

I am not attempting to glaze over the obvious negative parts of Virginia's past nor denigrate the obvious importance of Portugal in world events.  My point was that Virginia has very significantly contributed to Western philosophy, and its influence in world events is definitely still felt today.  As I consider democracy and liberalism the most important tenets of Western thought, I think the influence of Virginia on Western culture has been quite profound, certainly comparable to all but the biggest European states.

Furthermore, the GDP of Virginia is more than 1.5 times larger than Portugal, and Virginia has almost as many people.  Virginia is also home to the headquarters of the CIA and US Marine Corps.  So frankly, while I find it embarrassing that some Americans cannot locate Portugal on a map, I find it equally embarrassing that some Europeans hold the view that Europeans alone have been the driving force for world history and that no other people have contributed anything worthwhile at all.",0,1385570385,null,0,1385571557,0,cdo8rsw,t3_1rk7r2,t1_cdo8rsw,t1_cdo4hto,null,1428487032,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Lithuania has crazy emigration rates, and the party in power is the party of a guy who *hid out in Russia* for several years because he was wanted in Lithuania on fraud charges.

Latvia will never be able to really distance or cut itself off from Russia, since we share a border and Russia is one of Latvia's most important trading partners. That won't change anytime soon.

But the things that have been done in the last 20 years seem like quite the achievements to me - and I don't mean bad ones. Joining the EU and NATO, the restoration of the republic that was disrupted and occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, political enfranchisement of ethnic Latvians and support for the Latvian language and culture. It's not bad. The people who point to the massive emigration should also consider that emigration was also quite the urgent topic during the time of the first republic and Ulmanis' reign. A lot of young people can go where they want, learn what and wherever they want - in the UK, the Netherlands, South America, Spain. Some of them will stay there. Some of them will come back. We've got some of the best and cheapest internet access in the world. I very much doubt that the ethnic Russians who are living in Latvia would prefer to live in modern-day Russia, no matter what they say about being oppressed or discriminated against in Latvia.

I'm not in Latvia right now, but that's because I get depressed and my health takes a turn for the worse during the dark northern winter.

Apologies for the long-winded response, but I love my country and don't think ""stagnation"" is the right word to describe what's going on there. It's a turbulent time, with lots of uncertainties and changes going on, but Latvians have perservered through hundreds of years of occupation and subjugation - we're not going to fizzle out and die because of some challenges and new possibilities.",0,1385570803,null,0,false,0,cdo8y2o,t3_1rkfk0,t1_cdo8y2o,t1_cdo8ee5,null,1428486951,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

There are several clear failings in the UK's immigration system, and yet they keep focussing all of their attention on the wrong things. Too many people coming over as sponsored family members? Let's stick an arbitrary cap on the number of skilled migrants. Sure, it doesn't make economic sense, but it makes the numbers look better!

No, just freaking no.

Portugal held one of the largest empires, and has spread it's language far and wide from South America, over Africa and to China and India.

Following that logic, you should know as much about Corsica as you know about Virginia, since Napoleón was born there, and he played a crucial role in the aftermath of the French revolution, and went on to conquer huge parts of Europe.

&gt; There is the lesson on transitional controls. In 2004, the Labour government made the decision that the UK should opt out completely of transitional controls on the new EU member states. They had the right to impose a seven-year ban before new citizens could come and work here, but – almost alone in Europe – Labour refused it.

The UK *did* impose a transitional ban, which other countries, such as Denmark, did *not* impose. Citizens of Bulgaria and Romania have been able to freely work in Denmark since 2009, but the UK exercised its right to impose a 5-year transitional ban, hence the delayed 2014 date.

The SPD, Linke, and Grüne or (rot rot grün) have already experienced too much bickering and taken too many shots at each to form that coalition. Mostly because the SPD accuses the Linke of being a bunch of crackpots with unrealistic goals and zero international policy. Although Rot Rot Grün could form a coalition and take the majority, they won't until at least 2017 as was stated as a ""possibility"" by the SPD.  
  
The CDU/CSU will not form a minority government because they won't be able to get anything done.  
  
If the SPD members reject the contract the most likely outcome would be another round of voting. It's hard to say what might happen in that situation but the results would more than likely leave no particular party with a clear majority. Then it's back to the coalition dog and pony show all over again.  
  
The biggest problem is the CDU/CSU who continually gain voter base, why I have no idea, and continue to promise everything but never actually deliver anything substantial. They are popular among the older voters comically referred to as the ""voting dead"" in some circles who continue to rise in population as the country grows older.  
  
For most, Angela Merkel projects a sense of motherly security and she is crazy popular. Again, why? I'm not sure. She rarely, if ever, answers a question with a concrete answer always leaving room to wiggle out later. She never takes a concrete position on anything but rather delegates party position to the talking heads of the party.

To quote myself from a previous post, which you also replied to:

There are almost no countries in the world that have not been occupied by a European country.

Sure, sometimes governments fail, everywhere. But more often they work out, and my guess it that a functioning minority government in Germany or Sweden might be better than a majority government in Greece, or Spain, simply due to the trust one has in the government, the level of corruption etc.


I don't like majority governments of a single party.  A government  with absolute  majority can do whatever it want without public debate  like an emergency royal decree to take over the public tv that is ratified by the Congress after a two hours debate, energy sector reforms to favour the cronies, labour market reform, allow to public companies to be more secretive, tax hikes... I think that the only one normal  was  the one for approving an emergency program due to an earthquake in Lorca.

I actually prefer that a Parliament where there are multiple groups and every law has to be debated in public. Giving all the powers to a single party is risky.

&gt; However, everywher, one need a good and working opposition. According to my Spanish friend it was far to long since Spain had that. 

Yes at least the big parties, the previous Socialist PM did OK in opposition between 2001 and 2004,  I think it was the last one(it's a sad thing that he was a bad PM). The current PM(conservative) went to the sure path of only criticize without doing proposal and wait for an economic crisis. And going to elections promising  [more employment and lower taxes](http://i.imgur.com/7Li2fRZ.jpg).

I am not sure what are doing the Socialists now I don't hear them criticize the  government. Each other a lot of course.

Pour avoir vécu au Nigéria pendant 7 ans, j'ai eu une expérience directe de ces problèmes (et dans une certaine mesure, de l'islamisation, mais c'est le moment ou on est parti.  C'est un autre exemple d'ingérence internationale au passage, juste d'une autre nature)  Les populations (au sens ""réel"") existent aux frontières, à cheval sur différent pays.  Et dans certains cas deviennent donc des minorités dans tous les pays concernés.  Et beaucoup de ces pays ne subsistent que par la force. 

La meilleure solution sur le long terme serait probablement d'exploser l'afrique (pas avec des bombes hein ?) et de reformer les frontières et nations.  Le problème c'est que sur le court/moyen terme, ça serait le chaos total.  Il a fallu un millier d'années pour que les européens arrivent à une distribution de frontières et populations stable de façon semi autonome et c'est un millier d'années assez sanglantes.  Et vu nos intérêts dans la région et les risques que les violences ne débordent ou que l'afflux de réfugiés de guerre d'innonde no joli pelouses, on va tout faire pour éviter ça.

&gt; The last ""big"" coalition between CDU and SPD put some heavy injuries to SPD.

Yeah, and of course that hasn't to do with anything the SPD has done. Or hasn't done.

&gt; Merkel will kick out every minister who falls from grace of the massmedia and cash in every good deed their minions somehow manage to accomplish.

I'm pretty sure Merkel willl not kick out any of the SPD ministers. What you described happened more often in the coalition between CDU/FDP.

&gt; in a coalition you have to make trade-offs

What's wrong with that? They already agreed on a Mindestlohn that would come in the future and several other points.

&gt; Why does the CDU not try a minority government?

One word: Stability. CDU always wants stability, especially during a European crisis. You don't have stability if you can't even plan two steps ahead. Look at the US.

&gt;CDU wants to spy on its people?

CDU/CSU/SPD/Grüne/FDP/Linke want to spy on their people? FTFY

&gt;CSU wants a Autobahn-Charge for foreigners?

I agree that the charge for the Autobahn is a pretty stupid idea, but it isn't even stated that this is coming. CDU and SPD will wait for the EU decide wether that's ok or not. Merkel said multiple times that she is against it. It's just Seehofer's thing.

&gt;CDU wants to lower taxes for big industries?

CDU doesn't want to raise taxes. That's different from lowering them. And even if I'm wrong here (can't read everything) I don't necessarily see something un-democratic here.

&gt;Maybe the governing is slower and not so ""efficient""...

Again: See the US. In a dream world it could work, but in reality votes would get denied not because someone is really against something, but because they want to hinder another parties politics.

He didn't single out Jews, which is why I said ""anti-clerical or..."" In his case, he seems to just dislike religion. Some people really do hate Jews, though, and they present themselves as anti-circumcision activists to express that antisemitism in a ""legitimate"" way.

 &gt; ""Totalitarian:"" Of, relating to, being, or imposing a form of government in which the political authority exercises absolute and centralized control over all aspects of life, the individual is subordinated to the state, and opposing political and cultural expression is suppressed: ""A totalitarian regime crushes all autonomous institutions in its drive to seize the human soul"" (Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.)

Quas4r suggested preventing parents from imparting any religion to their child until the child is old enough to decide for himself. Such a law could only be enforced by personal surveillance on a massive scale and government control of access to religious institutions. Such a law would forbid people from bringing their kids to church; from reading the Bible to their kids at bedtime, etc.. How do you think that would look? This could only be enforced by a totalitarian police state that controls every minute aspect of your life.

&gt; If I come to the US and explain how cutting of the left little toe is an aspect of my religion and that it should be allowed due to the little importance for stability and the like do you think there will be anyone around that takes that shit when I plan to do it on a kid? And how the fuck would part of people's dick fit in their controlling the masses masterplan.

Do you have thousands of years of history backing up that ""cutting off the left little toe"" plan? Because if not, then you're just making stuff up. Religious *tradition* is called *tradition* for a reason. And this isn't really about the circumcision: it's about arbitrary government control over people's personal lives.

Est-ce qu'un politique a encore le pouvoir de changer les choses ? Quel monde veut-on promouvoir? ..."". Bref, on trouve des moments où ils osent sortir des trucs beaucoup plus osés qu'à la télé vu qu'il y a moins la pression médiatique.

Sur les sites du Sénat ou de l'assemblée tu as parfois de super présentations de gens du métier qui disent froidement leur point de vue sur ce qu'il faut changer. Le problème c'est que 90% du contenu est du baratin, il y a peu d'intervenants vraiment sympa. J'avais vu les 2 confs de Jancovici, un conf d'un conseiller en exil fiscal qui racontait le contexte de l'affaire Cahusac, des gens du ministère de la défence ou des renseignements. Ce genre de trucs.

The bans on female circumcision comes to mind. The practices comes from the same mix of Abrahamic religions and cultural tradition that oppresses women, just like the burqa.

I'd cite a few lines of the Convention on the Rights of the Child but the USA didn't ratify it. It seems the conservatives are against, along with the Southern Baptist Convention.

I can't have a conversation with someone from North America about politics because they always bring up pre-defined ideologies to the conversation and somehow expect that to be a good argument.

Their presidential candidate got 18% of the vote at the last election, and their centre-right rivals have dropped the alliance with the socialists against them. There is little coverage, certainly in comparison to the severity of the issue, because most people outside France cannot read French media.

Cameron's actual proposals are not especially extreme - for instance, he thinks that new migrants should have to be resident in the country for three months before they're entitled to benefits (the policy of the current Dutch government), or work for a year, or prove they have a prospect of employment, before they're entitled to indefinite benefits (many European countries do not provide indefinite benefits in any case), and that EU migrants found begging on the streets will be deported back to their home country, unless they can prove a good prospect of employment, and not allowed to return for 12 months.

Neo-nazis can be elected in the US,the tea-party itself is rather extremist,not neo-nazis, but an extreme has been voted in nonetheless. I would say that you the only way to make a comparison is between extremist parties, and not neo-nazis, as there is such a different political history between the two places. 

Golden Dawn in Greece is not voted in for their nazi agenda but because they promote other values. That's why people vote for them. A sheep in wolf's clothing. It's a flaw of democracy that people can be easily misled in times of crisis and europe has a long history from which to learn from. That's why the 5% mark has been introduced in many countries, and I personally find that very reasonable and a proper way of addressing some faults democracy has.

The headscarf ban. I don't know. France argues that it's based on secularism.Maybe a bit too extreme,but you cannot view it without actually knowing a lot about France's legal culture , culture and history, and I think it may be necessary to actually have lived in France for a while. The US legal culture is very different than the European one. Secularism is applied and interpreted differently in Europe than in the US, and more so than anywhere in France.

However, I do have a problem with the political correctness US has, and the constant reference to Europe as being racist. Europe is far more direct and impersonal. In some cases I definitely agree that there is an element of racism involved, but in many cases it's americans unable to adapt to a new method of communicating, and cultural norms. The same way I find insincere ""how are you"" salutes offensive, a lot of americans see certain direct remarks from europeans as borderline racist, and it's not always the case.",0,1385582776,null,0,1385583304,0,cdoebfm,t3_1rkjjh,t1_cdoebfm,t1_cdoe0xh,null,1428484374,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

I would agree that your story is a sign of discrimination, but again, that's not always the case.

There is a cultural difference between the two continents that causes a miscommunication in what's racist and what's not and what would be an acceptable thing to say.

We're all familiar with the US political correctness, but you can't claim to have taken an interest in european norms of what is acceptable and what is not. The ""How are you?"" was an example of the differences in communication.

Romania had better wake up to the problems it faces, and stop blaming others for at least pointing out an unsustainable trend. The solution to low wages in Romania is not for the whole country to move elsewhere.
