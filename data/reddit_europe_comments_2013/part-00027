What is staring everybody in the face is that it is not a good idea for the euro interest rate to be three times the US interest rate.

The austerity programmes should be eased and structural reforms, which will be quite painful enough, should be undertaken.

Germany should be willing to entertain an inflation rate of c. 4.5% instead of c. 2.5% to help create a benign environment for Europe to begin to heal.

It would also be a good thing if the Germans could get their vision beyond exploiting the mistakes of others to cement their dominance in Europe.   A dominance they use to pursue a rather narrow and misplaced interpretation of what is in the German interest. 

If the Germans were to countenance this, they'd make even more money and there is no reason to believe inflation would get out of control.

US QE has not resulted in runaway inflation.

Why are the U.S. agreeing to this, while some arguments for the creation of the common currency unit were that it will allow to fight the U.S. dollar ?

Food for thought:

Here's a report from a certain Isaac D. Andrews, U.S. secret agent operating in New Brunswick (Canada), report transferred to the State Department on May 13th 1854:

**""In order to help the partisan movements  to the annexation and of free trade in Canada, I have given 5000 dollars to the editor of a journal, 5000 dollars to a general prosecutor, 5000 dollars to a general inspector, and 15 000 dollars to a deputy of the Assembly of the New Brunswick. I have thus taken the necessary measures in order to moderate the opposition and calm the public opinion. I managed to travel to Fredericton before the end of session of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick and thus prevented any debate about the the treaty for free-trade or any other harmful legislative measure. I have spent more than 100 000 dollars to convince distinguished persons to support the annexation of Canada by the United States, or, in the absence, free-trade with the United States. But this amount is nothing compared to the privileges, power and influence that this shall  for ever grant to our Confederation.**""[source](http://www.davidorchard.com/online/fight/fightfor.html)

Six years after the Andrews report, it's the American Consul in Montreal's turn to write to his minister, the U.S. State Secretary Lewis Cass in 1860: ""**The [free-trade]treaty between the United States and Canada is slowly but surely transforming the five [Canadian] provinces into states of the Union**""(page 73 of David Orchard's work)

In September 18th 1888, Republican Senator of Ohio John Sherman (who is the President of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as well) makes [this spectacular speech from his platform](http://archive.org/details/cihm_13568):

“**I want Canada to be part of the United States. The way to union with Canada is not by hostile legislation; not by act of retaliation, but by friendly overtures. This union is one of the events that must inevitably come in the future: it will come by the logic of the situation, and no politician or combination of politicians can prevent it. The true policy of this Government is to tender freedom in trade and intercourse, and to make this tender in such a fraternal way that it shall be an overture to the Canadian people to become a part of this Republic**.""

In 1911, declarations in the same vein can be heard in the debates held in the Washington Congress on a new free-trade treaty between the U.S. and Canada:

+ Porter James McCumber, Republican Senator of North Dakota:""**The annexation of Canada is the logical conclusion of the free-trade agreement that we are signing with this country**""(page 152 of David Orchard's work) 
+ Charles Russell Davis, Republican representative of Minnesota dots the i's explaining that ""**the divine Providence will know to make use of this so-called treaty to merge even more so the two countries into one, under a same flag, the star-spangled banner**"".(page 152 of David Orchard's work)

One last example among many others, coming not from an American political official, but from a Canadian, John Deutsch, negotiator-in-chief of the project of an ultimate free-trade treaty proposed by Washington in 1948 (the project will be rejected by Canadian Prime Minister King):""**The price to pay for the liberalization of the customs with the United States it the loss of our political independence in the way that we will no longer have effective control of our national policies.

A hell of a lot of farmers went out if business and it took a huge amount of effort to stamp it out and also prove that to everyone's satisfaction. 

The measures put in place after that were meant to make it impossible for people to play silly buggers with the food supply. If these clowns could get horse eat all the way through processing and onto supermarket shelves then that means the measures and controls certainly are not working ... and we could have been eating *anything* ... and for all we know that's been the state of play for years.

Since both have been discarded, almost certainly nor very.

There can still be some immigration, but it would be something very hard to obtain because of the criteria which would ensure successful integration (for example, a skilled francophone Quebecer should obtain a visa easily to France if he wants it - or even a skilled francophone (Christian or secular) Lebanese).

I reject multiculturalism as I believe Europe, and individual European countries, are multicultural enough with each region having their things, but at least these native European cultures tend to be highly compatible with eachother.

It is a legitimate concern, and population replacement is irreversible, so there will be a moment when individual countries will reach a point of no return, and that to me is a catastrophic prospect. 

There is a demographic crisis however and we need to find a way to encourage Europeans to have children, notably through more clear and advantageous tax cuts for families, the development of nursing homes, advantages for women (in salary or something) if they have a child (because many women understand having children affects their job opportunities), and effective communication (propaganda?) on that subject.

If a dual citizen is say, French and British, and he lives in the UK, and goes around committing crimes in the UK, or suggesting seriously that France should invade the UK, or burning UK flags in Britain and all (realistically, that doesn't happen, but let's imagine), he should have his UK citizenship revoked, yes. However, indeed, for countries in the Schengen area, one would have difficulties expelling such a person, but taking the citizenship away remains a normal thing to do IMO.. that person doesn't deserve it.

&gt; Also for now that isn't a concern but what should we do when the European population get too identical genetically

That's not a concern in any near future. This is only a concern for populations of a few thousands living in remote villages. But 500 million Europeans wouldn't have inbreeding problems. There wouldn't be inbreeding problems in each individual countries either, since the populations are big enough.

&gt; So having all these problems why don't our governments do anything about it? 

It's a mixture of white guilt, rich white leaders living in a dream world, and wanting to get those precious votes from people of immigrant origin and from natives who have white guilt or live in their dream world where everything is for the better in the best of worlds, and there's nothing to do about it.

&gt; ([Summary here.](http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_08/02/2013_482508))

&gt; There was an investigation following the media reports. These are the findings.

&gt; * 4 people were arrested. 3 of them in [Veria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veria), where the [armed robbery](http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;lang='..'&amp;perform=view&amp;id=24664&amp;Itemid=1058&amp;lang=) took place, 1 in [Ptolemaida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaida).

&gt; * The 3 arrested in Veria were injured. The person arrested in Ptolemaida was not.

&gt; * The person arrested in Ptolemaida did not resist.

&gt; * According to testimonies, reports, and other circumstancial evidence, there was a scuffle when policemen tried to release the hostage and arrest them.

&gt; * Citizen eyewitnesses located in different positions around the place of arrest, testified that they saw the perpetrators resisting, falling and rolling into the ground.

&gt; * Administrative personnel in the police station the 3 were brought in following their arrest, saw them injured.

&gt; * The arrest of the 3 took place at around 12:50 in the center of the city of Veria.

&gt; * There is an amateur video taken immediately after their arrest, where it clearly shows one of them injured in the face. For the video click [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjUciH4_ljI). Still image [here](http://www.astynomia.gr/images/stories//2013/photos13/08022013_dey8.JPG).

&gt; * The 3 were brought into the police station at around 13:00-13:05.

&gt; * There are informal photographs taken with a mobile showing them sitting in an office at around 13:11-13:14. There are also photographs taken with a digital camera at around 13:30. Police released the photos and the metadata in both circumstances.

&gt; Questions:

&gt; 1) Why did the police doctor the photos?

&gt; Personally, I think it was a stupid decision. I can understand their line of thought though. These guys are linked to terrorism activities and they wanted to publish information to the public as soon as possible. They cleaned most of the blood from their faces but bruises wouldn't vanish. One of them wouldn't stand up, they doctored the hand holding him up. Another photo was too dark, they brightened it. Same with bruises, they tried to make them disappear (albeit with comical results) in order to make their faces more recognizable.

&gt; 2) What about Greek Police's history with violence/torture claims?

Some of them are true, and the same is unfortunately true for other police forces in Europe and around the world.

Absolutely not. Multiculturalism might be the nail in the coffin for already dying European culture.

I'd like to see tighter restrictions in terms of language proficiency and useful skills but overall I think it's a positive. Furthermore, in my country (the UK) it's not only migration *to* Europe but migration *within* Europe that's seen as a problem, and I would apply the same restrictions.

&gt; Are you happy that there is ""multiculturalism""?

Not really. I don't have any particular objections to immigrants preserving their native cultures as long as they still engage with the host country's culture.

&gt; What do you think about the fact that the native European population is melting down while the immigrant families are having more children?

It's based more on economic status than any intrinsic qualities of the immigrants. By the time you get to 3rd generation immigrants it will probably level out - if they have proper economic mobility.

&gt;  Is it a legitimate concern?

It's a legitimate concern but one out of all proportion to the actual 'threat.'

&gt;This is just pure unadulterated condescension from a know-nothing who likes to lecture people about how much he knows about society when he's probably never even had a real job or experience of the world outside of university.

That's quite a leap of logic. He's saying something you don't agree with and something you think has illogical jumps, and now you've made the assumptions he doesn't have a job. That's quite an illogical jump in itself.

&gt;the europhiles constantly stink up the place

This is /r/europe so you'd expect to see people who really buy into europhile ideas.

&gt;don't lecture me on reddiquette when it's been totally abandoned here

It's not been abandoned apart from the downvote system which is extremely regrettable and I would advise people to get back to using the proper method of only downvoting when a comment adds nothing to a conversation. However most other reddiquette is perfectly in order.

&gt;This isn't a genteel discussion this is an intellectual battle. 

You're really romanticising arguing/yelling at people over their believes. You're not going to convince any one here. You can prove yourself right as much as you want through individuals failure to accurately articulate way the European project is decent and through individuals own failures to explain things clearly. It's a conversation. It's not a battle. Yelling seldom solves anything. Calm discussion does and bringing up people's passed is more of a battle than a discussion.

&gt;There people are seeking to willfully destroy democracy and they will be opposed to the very end

It's good that you have strong believes, but arguing on the internet is a very poor way to opposed. Perhaps join a political party like UKIP or hand out fliers or something. Going to the European subbreddit and arguing with any one who thinks differently to you for what ever reason seems like a waist of efforts on your part and irritating to others who're simply enjoying a community and enjoying the discussions of idea how ever flawed you might see those ideas and communities to be.

&gt; So you can stop trying to be a little reddit cop with your comments to me, either debate as well, just vote or ignore because I am not going to change my opposition to these fascists.

A) You appear to be advocating what has become of /r/europe 's up/down vote system

B) You seem to be heavily generalising europhiles here. Not only are you saying they're fascists which isn't directly true but is quite a jump, what ever base that quite large jump might have it's still hyperbole. But most of all you're generalising all /r/europe 's members as if they all hold the same view which is woefully untrue. 

Anyway. There are countless flaws in every single even slightly long reddit post as your post proves. You've stated a clear narrative, a clear set of goals and a clear point of view however I've still managed to poke various holes in your point of view despite its apparent comprehensiveness. I very much doubt you'll change me in my views of you and I very much doubt I will change you in your views of you. So we both end up thinking each other are wrong irrespective of what the truth is. It's very easy to be misled about what people truley think, especially when you put them on the spot and especially when they're on the internet where (I'm going to generalise too here) are properly still young or are probably uninformed of the full idea.

**TL;DR**

* Please don't generalise Europhiles. Generalising Europe is hard enough.

* Don't see debate **here** as some sort of noble, romantic endeavour. It isn't. You're arguing with a whole host of people who've considered the European Dream to varying degrees, some of them in depth and some of them shallow. 

* I don't see what you see in going around here and trying to argue with random europhiles.

* again, please stop generalising. This is a very small community of people who like Europe, who use the internet, who use reddit who happen to want to use reddit for joining in with a community of Europe lovers. It's by no means a comprehensive community and in many ways is exceptionally, extremely limited in its scope of europhiles.

**PSS**

The highlights: 

* The report was done internally by the police and not by an independent third party. 
* There was no medical examination of the injuries to see if they were a result of a struggle or torture. 
* The metadata of the newly released photos are very confusing. There is a clock on the wall that has the wrong time, the camera's time is also all wrong. The file creation and modification times are all a mess. 
* Even if taken at face value, the newly released photos only prove that injuries were sustained during the arrest. They prove nothing regarding the nature of these injuries (normal struggle or abuse) and they do nothing to prove that there was no torturing done afterwards.
* There is a police officer from the municipality having gone on record who claims that there was little struggle during the arrest. 

Not to mention, the Greek police does have a worrying record of torturing or abusing people and then lying about it. The article mentioned two such examples: 

* One a few months ago that was featured in Guardian and the minister said he would sue. Later, a medical report came out suggesting that the injuries were a result of torture. 
- Another case was a few years ago. The police claimed that the injuries were sustained after tripping at a flower pot. Later a video came out clearly showing the police beating him.

true,e1821e,GREE,Greece,"&gt; Here's an article explaining why the investigation made by the Greek police does little in the way of proving there was no abuse.

The article is written by a person reproducing SYRIZA's (Leftists) press release, adding a few points which I'll examine below.

This is SYRIZA's press release.

http://www.syn.gr/gr/keimeno.php?id=30781

SYRIZA asks 4 questions. In brief:

* Is the investigation reliable?
* Why is it that only the perpetrators were injured?
* Are the testimonies corroborated by forensic doctors' findings?
* Should we consider the report reliable, since ""Amnesia International"" (that's what they wrote instead of Amnesty International) talks about a culture of impunity inside the Greek Police forces?

As you see, Baboulias' article is merely translating SYRIZA's press release.

Let discuss all points now.

The Ministry responded immediately. For the record, SYRIZA did not pursue this matter after the Ministry's response.

http://www.mopocp.gov.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;perform=view&amp;id=4499&amp;Itemid=564&amp;lang=

* The investigations for cases concerning the public sector are carried out by the competent authorities. You don't appoint judges or investigators some random people from the street. Police forces worldwide have separate branches carrying out these tasks. This investigation was carried out by the Office of Internal Affairs. These are the same people carrying out investigations about rogue cops associated with drug dealers etc.

* A policeman was also injured, and this is added to their long list of charges.

* The perpetrators refused to collect the forensic order forms, in order to be examined by a forensics doctor! But with the criminal investigation underway, one way or another they will have to be examined.

* There is nothing wrong with the metadata. The metadata are only confusing for those that can't read them. FFS, you of all people are qualified to read them. Pay attention to the file names. Baboulias plays dumb or purposedly mixes the different timestamps and file write/modification times. I'll give you one example. They were arrested at 12:50. They were inside the police station 20 minutes later. The timestamps from the mobile photos are in the file names (20130201_131151.jpg, 20130201_131301.jpg, 20130201_131411.jpg). That's how many mobile phones work.

* They were arrested at 12:50. There are citizen eyewitnesses reporting the struggle. There is even a video showing the bloody face of one of them. They were in the middle of the city, held for a few minutes and then taken to the police station. Minutes later, we have photos showing clearly that they were hit in their faces. In case that is difficult to understand how bruising works, when you get hit your face doesn't turn black instantly.

* The new conspiracy theory with the clock is absolutely ridiculous. The sun is shining, the clock shows 8:25. They were brought in 5 hours later. Obviously the clock run out of battery.

Regarding past actions by some members of the police forces, I think that I covered that in my previous comment. ",0,1360512658,null,0,1360523624,0,c8coiai,t3_188c6o,t1_c8coiai,t1_c8cnwit,null,1431249687,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

&gt; Your opinion on migration to Europe.

As long as they can adapt to our values and can contribute to our society they ought to be welcome. With priority/leniency to highly educated folks. 

&gt; Are you happy that there is ""multiculturalism""?

Depends on your definition. As long as they adapt to our core cultural values (freedom of speech, religious freedom, freedom from discrimination, egalitarianism, right to property, secrecy of communication, unacceptability of violence, you know the basics) everything should be fine. The added variety to our cuisine, music, art, literature, etc is an enrichment to our society.

&gt; Would you like it better if all immigration ceased?

Doubt it. Last year, in the Netherlands, we had a net-gain of ~38k people from non-western countries. It would probably be a gross injustice to assume that the majority of these people will be a detriment to our society. Though I don't know how the Dutch figures are compared to the rest of Europe.

&gt; What do you think about the fact that the native European population is melting down while the immigrant families are having more children? Is it a legitimate concern?

Nah not really. It's blown way out of proportion.

Not quite sure why the UK is the most popular destination for new members of the EU when others are closer. Is it because English is their second language?

&gt; In 2010, the latest year for which the data is available, 591,000 people moved to Britain - more than double the number who migrated to France, which received 251,200.

&gt;Spain reported the second highest influx, at 465,200, followed by Italy with 458,900 and Germany with 404,100.

&gt;The UK also had the highest number of people acquiring citizenship in 2010, at 194,800. 

There is going to be an estimated 50,000 a year in the first five years from Bulgaria and Romania, but the government's estimates were lower than what actually transpired the last time, so i'd expect more than 50k per year.

I don't for a second support the Tories or their policies but as someone from a decidedly working class background myself I don't see immigration and foreigners ""stealing"" jobs as the problem, since it means there are jobs to be had, so much as areas of *generational* unemployment. 


Both my parents earn a pittance but my sister and I were both raised well, never lacking things we *needed*, and I've had a job of some sort or another pretty much continuously from my first paper round in my early teens. I know I invite criticism when I say this but there are, irrefutably, areas of Britain where the Brits themselves don't have any interest in getting a job. I have lived in such areas.

**ΝΟ.** This is a lie.

This guy is talking about **Kozani**, his jurisdiction. They were called after the robbery took place (3:51 of video). The robber arrested in Kozani (Ptolemaida) was not injured, because he did not resist. The *other* guy from Imathia later talks about a dynamic intervention.

Regarding your other point now.

You have to assume that the clock was malfunctioning, you have to assume that the camera was in DST, you have to assume that they give a file first created in a different computer that the one they show.

This is what the article is claiming. Not that the pictures were not taken at that point. But rather, that the way the data are presented they are *not* showing what it is claimed. Further assumptions have to be made. 

So of course *given* the premise that these photos were taken at 13.15 we can assume that the camera is in DST, that the clock in the background is broken, or that they show us the files in a different computer than the one it was first created. But what *is* under question here is whether the pictures were actually taken at that point, and the metadata presented need to back that claim.

Why should I believe that these pictures were taken at 13.15 and not at 14.15? Then police could have altered the files but missed the ones from the camera. The data as given cannot support that this claim is false. 

Do you understand this point? When you present data to back your claims your data has to be sound. If the police hasn't fixed their camera's clock, this is not my problem. It is theirs. This is what the article implies, that the  data as given mean nothing.

For much of my childhood my parents would have done better financially if one of them was out of work, but they very much were committed to an honest day's work. As such I always have done my best to support myself without looking for aid from family or from the government so I confess I come into such things very biased because I can't help but feel that if I can drag myself through life under my own power, others should be able to. 


As for non-working immigrants, well, I feel the same about them as I do about non-working Brits. A minimum acceptable standard of living safety net, no bells and whistles. Support for finding work and support for getting into training and apprenticeships.

true,anarchisto,ROMA,Romania,"&gt; So I was wondering what you guys think about the demographic crisis Europe is suffering right now.

In Romania, we face an overwhelming outward migration. Millions of (mostly young) Romanians left already for better-paid positions in Western Europe. In Italy alone, there are over a million Romanian citizens.

I'm not complaining about this: they have better perspectives there and I don't see a point in our nationalists' cries about how they'll be assimilated and cease to be Romanians.

Nevertheless, I see a worrying trend: if millions of people from Eastern Europe in their 20s and 30s leave (the same is valid for Poland, Bulgaria, etc), there's an even more serious demographic crisis here than in Western Europe. If most young people leave and the older people stay behind, how is our social-security system going to work? We already have more pensioneers than employed people.

The only solution for this would be to have a common EU-wide social security pool, but I know that this will not be accepted easily by the Western countries.

Greece and Bulgaria also ask them to stop being ridiculous, claiming heritage from Alexander the Great and Czar Samuel. How they manage to do something so outrageous is beyond my comprehension.

Spending time walking around the Eternal city is amazing. Depending on what religion you are (or not) or your love for history, there is everything for everyone. from churches that don't look like churches, to fountains, to grand obelisks that were stolen from the egyptians. 

The art is amazing, the churches are that as well. I would do some research on things that you want to see. Trevi fountain is a great place to visit. As is piazza Navona. The sculptures there are just fantastic. When I took some friends out in 2008, we did an ""Angels and Demons tour run' Basically, we went from church to church that are in the Dan Brown Novel and traversed the city. It was a lot of fun, we got to see a lot of the city and enjoyed following along with the story of the book/movie if you are more inclined. Not sure what else to say. But, enjoy the city as much as you can, you are taking a trip that most want to do, but never experience.

The Eternal city is truly that. There is so much to see, and even if you had an eternity, I am not sure you would be able to see and experience it all.

As for visiting, I can recommend a trip to Leipzig Zoo. I know it sounds like a kiddie thing to do, but the Zoo in Leipzig is really good. 

You might also want to check out whether there are any rock concerts, for example Depeche Mode and Eric Clapton will give concerts in Leipzig in June 2013.

It would not be better if all immigration stopped. We should stop asylum seekers. If you are a specialist you are welcome.

We should make policies that severely limit the amount of children people get. For example only 2 children a family will get financial support, maternity leave etc. Not prohibiting people to have 3 or more children but you need to pay for that yourself, no state subsidies for that.

Fill out your form (use your friend's address), they will give you a number, you wait for a while, they call your number, and you go to the desk and they walk you through the paperwork, you sign a few times, they give you a form to go to any bank and pay 10 EUR. Go to Barclays next door, pay the 10 EUR, receive proof of payment go back in, present proof of payment and they will have your NIE ready for you.

**NO. THIS IS KOZANI""S POLICE DIRECTOR. KOZANI IS NOT IN IMATHIA. GEOGRAPHY, HOW DOES IT WORK?**

Did you watch the whole video? Please, don't just reproduce what people with limited language skills wrote. I see several Greek blogs ""reporting"" the same ""fact"". Nonsense.

Let me help you out.

There are three guys in this press conference.

http://i.imgur.com/ucrlhWF.jpg

The guy in the centre is Vaios Chondros. He is police chief for West Macedonia and talks about the operation in general. Then he lets the other two guys talk about the part of the operation in their jurisdictions.

The second guy (your guy) is Yorgos Karaitsis. He is Kozani's police director. The robber arrested in Kozani did not resist. He says all went well, no harm done, that's that.

The third guy is Nikos Batouvakis. He is Imathia's police director. He talks about the part of the operation that took place in Veria. ""Dynamic intervention"" was his exact phrase. This means ""we warned them, no response, we went all in"".

&gt; I don't see how the ""4 arrested but only 3 tortured"" is an argument for anything. 

No resistance = no harm done

Resistance = things will get ugly

They had to arrest armed people holding a hostage. Those armed people resisted. They had to force them to drop their guns and arrest them. I'm not sure what makes it *that* difficult to understand. Eyewitnesses saw everything. Policemen did not go there in order to invite them to a party. They went there to take these guns:

Downtown Detroit is a really cool place to be, it has come a long way. There's a very large farmers market on the weekends, as well as museums, and a lot of historic buildings. There's lots of great architecture to be seen in Detroit, and a lot of great neighborhoods to drive through. There's almost always something going on at the waterfront in the summer, as well as Tigers baseball games. 

I would never really be worried about driving around in Detroit. It's not necessarily the crime that's bad...it's how decrepit some parts of the city have gotten.

Let's assume that Norway and Switzerland (and the various microstates) remain outside the EU for the time being. Beyond these countries are Belarus and Ukraine, both of which are too heavily under Russian influence to be a palatable expansion target, and there is no way Russia itself will join the EU any time soon. Azerbaijan has made no desire to join the EU as well. That leaves two countries: Georgia and Armenia. Both of these countries have made joining the EU explicit goals. Georgia is influenced by Russia slightly more than Armenia, but given its recent history with Russia, it is more firmly in the pro-EU camp. Armenia is also a likely candidate, given that there is a substantial EU presence in the country, and the large, and more importantly, rich, Armenian diasporas in the United States and France, would welcome its accession to the EU. Ultimately, it seems Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia are the least likely to join the EU without some sort of massive reform and fundamental change in their political cultures. Beyond the current focus of expansion, Armenia and Georgia are the most likely to join.

It would be really weird to have Turkey and Armenia in the EU without their relationship improving significantly, however. It will likely be one or the other for some time.

The EU will not expand beyond Europe, even if some former colonies can be argued to be culturally and politically similar. It's simply too difficult and unnecessary.

&gt;Wrong.

From your link:
""The extent to which different markets are free, as well as the rules defining private property, is a matter of politics and policy.""
""State capitalism consists of state ownership of the means of production within a state""
""There is general agreement that capitalism became dominant in the Western world following the demise of feudalism."" Not quite free enterprise at that point. Not to mention that starting capital for a pauper can be as hard to come by as a noble title for a pauper.

&gt;Again, not true, if there isn't the freedom to pursue one's own achievements, you are not in a capitalist society. Slaves and serfs were treated like cattle and not like people in their own rights, these were feudal societies and not capitalist societies.

So that means that 19th century USA was not capitalistic, nor are most economies then today: the number of slaves today remains as high as 12 million to 27 million.

&gt;Capital can be privately owned, people can't be owned at all.

But they have no rights if they don't have property.

&gt;Right, and that's a distortion of capitalism and free trade, the more restrictions there are, the farther you are from any such system.

Then consider that whilst many of the politicians might not want to return to something like under Communism of old, that it was under such a system many of them first worked in politics and formulated their ideals.

Now, when considering all that, listen to an activist that actually spent over a decade in prison and confinement for being a dissident [who's seen it all before](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM2Ql3wOGcU#t=0m06s) and listen to his comparisons.

true,CreepyOctopus,LATV,Latvia | Sweden,"We Europeans are mostly exposed to American culture in terms of movies, games, TV and music. Hollywood movies are the majority of what's shown in theaters, far more than local or other European movies. American TV series are shown here, this includes older series that keep getting reruns (think Friends) and current series from networks like HBO or CBS. Usually they're a year or two behind the original broadcast schedule, but many people just watch that online.

Video games should be self-explanatory, the majority of them are either made in America or at least published and marketed primarily for the American market.

Music also, from MTV to other things. I don't really follow modern music but can tell you that major American artists and hits - Beyone, Lady Gaga or others - are just as popular here.

Other pop culture phenomena also tend to be strongly represented. Everything Game of Thrones, books and series, seems quite popular here now (I'm in Sweden).

I would actually say that the only major area of culture where the US has little influence in Europe is sports. Football is by far the primary sport here, with religious following in several countries. American football and baseball have a miniscule following here, basketball is more popular but the NBA still definitely has less following than in the US.

*Il cardinale Bagnasco e don Georg tifano per Monti. Il segretario di Stato Tarcisio Bertone spera invece nel colpo di coda di Berlusconi. Insomma, i vescovi vanno al voto in ordine sparso. Ma non smettono di dettare condizioni*




A due settimane dal voto il Vaticano è spaccato in due partiti. Contrapposti e l'un contro l'altro armati. Capeggiati dai due soliti arcinemici: Tarcisio Bertone, il segretario di Stato che spera in un nuovo miracoloso recupero di Silvio Berlusconi, e dal capo della Conferenza episcopale italiana Angelo Bagnasco, che da settimane - coadiuvato dal segretario di papa Benedetto XVI Georg Gänswein - sta provando a tirare la volata a Mario Monti. Con un triplice obiettivo: ricostruire una casa per i conservatori meno populista e antieuropea, mettere il cappello sul nuovo partito e fare piazza pulita dei suoi avversari interni.
Se all'inizio della campagna elettorale gli osservatori più attenti consideravano il partito pro Monti in netto vantaggio, e molti cantavano la fine del regno di Bertone, nell'ultimo mese il mood è cambiato. Complici i sondaggi che danno Silvio Berlusconi in netta ripresa e alcuni errori tattici del Professore nei rapporti con le alte gerarchie, l'esercito di Bagnasco sta perdendo vigore, con prelati che suonano la ritirata e cardinali impegnati a disegnare strategie in ordine sparso.

Oggi, per mappare gli schieramenti in campo, bisogna comunque partire da due dati di fatto: se i cattolici italiani non seguono come una volta i dettami delle gerarchie ecclesiastiche, è certo che quasi tutti in Vaticano temono una larga vittoria del Partito democratico e di Nichi Vendola. E stanno facendo di tutto per evitarla.

TIFOSI DELLA PRIM'ORA

Bagnasco e don Georg sono stati i primi a mollare Berlusconi e a puntare sul Professore. Il tentativo finale, e assai ambizioso, è quello di trasformare ""Scelta civica"" in una nuova Balena bianca. Bagnasco non ha avuto difficoltà a scegliere Monti: ne apprezza il rigore, la competenza, e vede nel premier affinità caratteriali. Entrambi elitari, freddi e distaccati, nonostante si conoscano bene amano darsi ancora del ""lei"", e quando chiacchierano gareggiano in dotte citazioni.
Nel 2011 è Bagnasco il primo a rompere con il Pdl, benedicendo l'incontro organizzato a Todi dalle associazioni cattoliche avverse al governo Berlusconi. Un appuntamento messo in piedi dal consigliere spirituale della Comunità di Sant'Egidio monsignor Vincenzo Paglia (ottimi i suoi rapporti con il capo della Cei) e da Andrea Riccardi, il leader dell'associazione di Trastevere che pochi mesi dopo entrerà nel nuovo esecutivo montiano, diventando di fatto braccio destro del premier.

Non è un caso che a dicembre scorso sia proprio il numero uno della Cei insieme al giornale dei vescovi ""Avvenire"" a lanciarsi in un clamoroso endorsement a favore del presidente del Consiglio, confidando su sondaggi che segnalavano un Monti-boom vicino al 18 per cento. Un appoggio che spiazza Bertone e Camillo Ruini, ma concordato nei dettagli con don Georg. Che, da mesi, si sta dando da fare con l'ambasciatore di Monti in Vaticano Federico Toniato, vicesegretario della presidenza del Consiglio e da anni amico personale del segretario di Ratzinger: i due organizzano diversi incontri bilaterali (potesse votare, in molti scommettono che Ratzinger nel segreto dell'urna sceglierebbe ""Scelta civica"") e spingono affinché il governo si impegni a finanziare scuole e ospedali cattolici. Risultato: a fine 2012 al Bambin Gesù arrivano 12,5 milioni, altri 5 vengono destinati al Gaslini di Genova. La legge di stabilità regala anche 223 milioni alle scuole paritarie, mentre la vicenda dell'Imu si chiude con una vittoria schiacciante della Chiesa: grazie ai buoni uffici del premier a Bruxelles gli enti religiosi che producono utili dovranno pagare la tassa sugli immobili solo a partire da quest'anno. Gli arretrati evasi (secondo i radicali la cifra supererebbe i 2,5 miliardi di euro) vengono invece abbonati. Per sempre.

LISTE INDIGESTE

Dopo Natale, però, il patto di ferro tra Bagnasco e Monti comincia a mostrare le prime crepe. A inizio gennaio il cardinale manda al presidente del Consiglio, attraverso Paglia, la lista dei ""valori non negoziabili"" da inserire nell'agenda, ma il Professore nicchia. Non una parola, nel programma, su questioni cruciali come aborto, centralità della famiglia, eutanasia. Non solo. Nelle liste di ""Scelta civica"" entra soltanto l'ex presidente delle Acli Andrea Oliviero e qualche esponente di Sant'Egidio, mentre l'Udc di Pier Ferdinando Casini - che è in rapporti pessimi con Bertone - blinda le sue liste, infilando decine di notabili del partito. Anche l'alleanza con il laico Gianfranco Fini, fautore del referendum per l'abrogazione della legge 40 sulla fecondazione assistita, non viene digerita bene.

La  candidatura al Senato di Alessio De Giorgi, direttore di Gay.it (che ha deciso di ritirarsi dopo che ""Libero"" lo ha accusato di gestire siti in cui escort gay si prostituirebbero), è dirompente. Bagnasco vacilla e si chiede se ha puntato sul cavallo giusto. I rapporti peggiorano con lo scoppio dell'ennesima battaglia tra Vaticano e Banca d'Italia: i primi di gennaio Via Nazionale nega a tutte le banche del Paese l'autorizzazione a lavorare nella Santa Sede. La Deutsche Bank Italia, che gestisce da anni il servizio per tutti i pagamenti elettronici in Vaticano, è così costretta a bloccare pos, bancomat e carte di credito. Motivo: lo Ior e la Santa Sede, paese extracomunitario, non avrebbero una normativa adeguata in materia di anti-riciclaggio. «Il Vaticano è andato in tilt», racconta un monsignore, «ancora oggi per entrare ai Musei bisogna pagare in contanti. Il governo è stato passivo, il governatore di Bankitalia Ignazio Visco e il suo amico Monti non ci hanno aiutato. Al contrario».

Dopo l'Epifania i nemici di Bagnasco approfittano dell'impasse e vanno all'attacco. Camillo Ruini, che tra i politici ha ancora Gianni Letta come punto di riferimento privilegiato, dice ai suoi che bisogna riavvicinarsi al Pdl. Mentre Riccardi decide di non candidarsi, lo strappo tra Monti e quella parte del mondo cattolico che lo aveva appoggiato apertamente viene certificato con l'annullamento del nuovo incontro previsto a Todi: Bagnasco sonda la base e capisce che l'appuntamento rischia di trasformarsi in una contestazione al premier. «Monti va ancora appoggiato, ma nell'ombra».

true,strozzapreti,null,null,"BERLUSCONI FOR EVER

La corrente dei bertoniani, nonostante tutto, considera invece il Cavaliere l'unico interlocutore ancora affidabile. «Bertone ha una simpatia innata per Berlusconi. Ogni volta che si incontrano scherzano sulle comuni radici salesiane. Sono alla mano, parlano di calcio, fanno battute. La verità? Sua eminenza preferisce avere a che fare con un peccatore spudorato che con un saccente moralista», chiosa una fonte vicina al segretario di Stato, ancora potentissimo nonostante molti vaticanisti ne profetizzino un giorno sì e l'altro pure il declino e il pensionamento anticipato.

Non è solo una questione di pelle, naturalmente. Bertone e Ruini non dimenticano che l'unico che ha avuto il coraggio di firmare provvedimenti oltranzisti (come l'incredibile decreto per ""salvare"" Eluana Englaro) è stato proprio Berlusconi. Sanno che su di lui possono contare, sempre e comunque. Anche il cardinale Mauro Piacenza, che spera un giorno di prendere il posto di Bertone, punta su Berlusconi. Che ha ottimi amici, ancora, anche in Lombardia, regione chiave per gli equilibri del Senato. Se parte di Comunione e Liberazione stanca degli scandali giudiziari che hanno investito il loro storico riferimento Roberto Formigoni voterà Monti alle politiche e Gabriele Albertini alle regionali, i berluscones Maurizio Lupi e Renato Farina hanno ancora presa su una parte consistente del movimento. Il partito di riferimento della curia milanese, con in testa l'arcivescovo Angelo Scola, resta ancora il Pdl.

I bertoniani hanno chiesto e ottenuto la riconfermare dei teocon Maurizio Sacconi, Gaetano Quagliariello e Eugenia Roccella, ma sanno bene che la vittoria del duo Bersani-Monti è più che probabile. E così, dicono i bene informati, il segretario di Stato ha dato il suo appoggio alla candidatura di Renato Balduzzi nelle liste di Monti. La vicenda dell'ex ministro della Sanità è significativa: da sempre vicino al Pd, bindiano della prima ora, dopo l'esperienza al governo (come ministro della Salute) ha provato a candidarsi nelle file dei democratici. Che, però, hanno fatto muro. Balduzzi ha chiesto consiglio all'amico cardinale Giuseppe Versaldi, che gli ha suggerito di accettare un posto da capolista con ""Lista civica"". Versaldi è uno che conta parecchio: bertoniano di ferro, è il presidente della Prefettura degli Affari economici, il super-ministero dell'economia della Santa Sede. «In caso di ticket Monti-Bersani, Balduzzi potrebbe tornare a fare il ministro. La Chiesa apprezzerebbe», chiosano sotto il cupolone.

PERICOLO ROSSO

Se Beppe Grillo e Antonio Ingroia sono visti come inguaribili mangiapreti e considerati inavvicinabili, il rapporto tra Vaticano e il Pd resta ancora difficile. «Ho visto le immagini di Bersani che esulta con il suo staff per la vittoria. Quei giovani che erano con lui alzavano il pugno!» chiosò sgomento monsignor Rino Fisichella commentando le immagini delle primarie del Pd. «E' davvero questo il futuro che abbiamo innanzi? Non credo sia giusto far finta di nulla». Al di là delle affermazioni dei prelati più conservatori (Fisichella è considerato un fan accanito del Pdl: leggendaria la sua dichiarazione dove spiegava che una bestemmia scappata a Berlusconi andava «contestualizzata»), per il clero la presenza di Vendola nell'alleanza è considerata un ostacolo quasi insormontabile a un dialogo proficuo con la sinistra: il governatore pugliese continua a ipotizzare tagli ai finanziamenti delle scuole private, leggi per legalizzare i matrimoni omosessuali e adozioni per le coppie gay.

Persino i cattolici Rosy Bindi e Franco Marini non sono mai stati ben visti. Epperò, paradossalmente, nelle liste dei democrat la presenza di esponenti cattolici è più consistente che altrove: tra loro Edo Patriarca, ex coordinatore del Family Day, Ernesto Preziosi dell'Istituto Toniolo (l'ente che controlla la Cattolica e il Gemelli), la figlia di Flaminio Piccoli Flavia Nardelli, personaggi come Giorgio Santini della Cisl e la storica contemporanea Emma Fattorini.

Tra le enclave che spostano più consenso, se l'Opus Dei come da tradizione non si schiera con nessuno (l'Opera appoggia sempre e solo chi vince), le associazioni no-profit impegnate nel terzo settore sembrano invece preferire il Pd, fautore di una politica economica meno rigorista rispetto a Monti. Bersani promette risorse al volontariato, e s'è guadagnato l'appoggio del mensile ""Vita"", dei progressisti di ""Famiglia cristiana"" e di una parte di Azione cattolica, mentre l'anima conservatrice di Ac, quella che fa capo a Dino Boffo, vota ancora Pdl. Nella confusione della guerra tra fazioni, una cosa è sicura: se dovesse vincere il centrosinistra con una maggioranza forte e coesa, gli equilibri vaticani cambieranno profondamente. E il fronte dei berlusconiani, inevitabilmente, perderebbe il suo decennale predominio.

There's a large number of you which just act like a hive-mind and it's bloody stupid. If you disagree, say why and don't up-vote. Don't down-vote unless they contribute nothing to the conversation. You're making all Europhiles look bad and by-enlarge the entire European project.

You have no idea how many times I've had to step in and say that not all Europhiles are as short sited as some of you. How many times I've had to state that not all Europhiles are idiots. You're making the European project look like it's stupid. **Stop it**. **now**.

* Which is pointless and only serves to aggravate people pointlessly. If you're going to be irksome due to an amount of people using the voting system in this incorrect way, then we might as well use the system properly and avoid your side-step your unpleasantness. 

 I understand why you see it pointless to be polite, I would like you to remain polite anyway, but understand that that is not going to happen if the way this reddit works remains how it is. So we should change the way we use this reddit for a whole flurry of reasons, not least of which it inspires people to be rude and pointlessly irritating. Sub-reddits can be extremely nice communities so it'd be good if people being pointlessly irksome were kept to a minimum.

What kind of reply is that? So, whatever the government says the ""competent authority"" is on a subject we must just accept it? First, your so-called ""competent authority"" has a conflict of interest. Second, the article I linked to spends two paragraphs talking about how inappropriate it is for that ""authority"" to conduct the investigation. Allow me to quote:

&gt; So can anyone really rely on the police to investigate itself? Especially in cases like this one, the Greek police is infamous for its tendency to cover up incidents or stall cases to the point of scandal. For the period 2005-09, 281 cases of police brutality were investigated. From those, only thirteen reached any conclusion. And no one is yet ready to forget how this specific agency (North Greece Internal Affairs charter) handled the case of the severe beating of Augoustinos Dimitriou, a Cypriot student, by 8 police officers in Thessaloniki in 2006, before a video that proved his abuse was published. Then, as now, ministers and police officials had gone on record saying they saw no signs of police brutality but “sheer professionalism” and blamed a flower pot for his injuries.

&gt; The situation with Internal Affairs is so bad that a new agency had to be founded. The new division for dealing with police arbitration therefore came into being, unfortunately only on paper, as the agency is still inactive. Even if activated, it will still be under police management, and not an independent body that would secure some impartiality. This comes after a number of convictions in European courts and officials from Amnesty International publicly condemning the police for co-operating with the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn.

&gt; A policeman was also injured, and this is added to their long list of charges.

Only he was not injured badly and his injuries are just his leg. This is a far cry from these guys. 

&gt; The perpetrators refused to collect the forensic order forms, in order to be examined by a forensics doctor! 

This is indeed a good point. We will see how it will play out. 

&gt; There is nothing wrong with the metadata.

IvanTheNth explained this pretty well. If you bring data, it better be accurate. You can't bring data and say ""oh, of course this data is a bit wrong, but if it were correct it would corroborate with my story"". 

As an example, imagine what would happen if these guys brought out a photo claiming that they were not at the crime scene during the time the crime was committed, but the EXIF data was an hour too early or too late to support their alibi. Would you buy their ""we forgot to set up the camera's clock correctly"" story?
