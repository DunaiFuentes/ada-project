Anyway, I am in no way ashamed of the bonds my country has for other Balkan states, we are south Slavs, and we speak almost the same language as most other south Slavs. 

On the other hand it is erroneous to say we weren't influenced by Austria as much as Serbia. We have been in the same country as Hungary since 1022 to 1918. That's almost a thousand years. And for most of that time Austria was also an important, maybe even the most important and influential part of that. 

On the other hand, If you take Dalmatia and Istria, they were under strong influence of Italians, most notably Venice, both political and cultural. 


Also, to be taken into account is the fact that we share the same religion with Austria and Italy, while not with Serbia. It was a very important factor in history, and to some people it stays so even today, unfortunately.

We have been in the same country as Serbia for only 45 years, only a fraction of the time, compared to our other neighbors. 

Nothing to be ashamed of, either way.

&gt;Le Conseil constitutionnel contrôle la mise en œuvre du referendum (art. 11 al. 4) et la proposition de loi référendaire qui peut en résulter (art. 61 al. 1)

Je cite :

&gt; L'article 61 ne faisant aucune distinction entre les lois selon leur mode d'élaboration, on aurait pu penser que le Conseil était également compétent pour connaître de la régularité de celles qui ont été adoptées par référendum. Tel n'a cependant pas été son avis. Saisi par le président du Sénat d'une demande de déclarer non conforme à la Constitution la loi relative à l'élection du Président de la République adoptée par le référendum du 28 octobre 1962, il s'est déclaré incompétent au motif que la loi n'émanait pas des représentants du peuple mais du peuple lui même et qu'il ne pouvait exercer son contrôle sur le souverain (déc. 62-20 DC du 6 novembre 1962). [passage expliquant que ce raisonnement est assez étrange, et pourquoi]

&gt; Cette jurisprudence a été confirmée par la décision du 20 septembre 1992, dite Maastricht III, relative à une loi autorisant la ratification d'un traité. Seules les lois parlementaires peuvent donc faire l'objet d'un contrôle de conformité à la Constitution. Mais une évolution jurisrudentielle paraît aujourd'hui [aujourd'hui = 2011] possible, car en 2005, le Conseil n'a pas écarté la possibilité d'examiner non pas la loi référendaire elle-même, mais le décret soumettant la loi au référendum.

A clever insight I learned from the lady at the shelter where we got our dog from: She prefers to give high-energy dogs to people with apartments (we have a Parson-Russell) because apartment-owners don't have the choice to become lazy with their dogs as yard-owners do. They are forced to go outside with their dogs and engage their dogs instead of just opening the door to the yard (as dogs tend to become quite bored if often only being let out into their own yard - no new things to smell or new buddies to meet).

I only speak English and my spouse speaks both English and French fluently. We had no trouble in Germany whatsoever. The Germans are fantastic and I found them to be very willing to lend a hand whenever possible and nearly all of them seem to speak enough English to at least point you in the right direction. Many of them speak excellent English.

The Flemish part of Belgium was similar, and although I've never been to Netherlands, I can imagine it might be more of the same as they share a border. I know several people who have traveled throughout Netherlands and have had no trouble with language barriers.

Europeans are generally far beyond North Americans in terms of languages, save for the countryside of France, nearly everybody we encountered spoke at least a little bit of English, and most of them seemed to have a command of at least one language other than their own.

All said, I don't think you have much to worry about, particularly because much of this route plows straight through Germany. You're unlikely to have any trouble. If you do encounter somebody who can't make sense of what you're asking, just thank them and go on to the next person.

If you can, take the time even to learn a little bit of German before you go. It's a language similar in many regards to English, so it's not hard to pick up. I knew just a small collection of words from a university course that I took long ago when I went and I was surprised how much it helped when there wasn't a person to help me read a sign or operate a ticket kiosk, etc.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Since you're for massively lowering taxes, where does the money come from?

From the money we'll no longer spend in state companies and in subsidies.

&gt; If they have to pay taxes, they're going to pay for it one way or the other. But I mostly agree that the state should be the ones to educate them and so on, the problem is that then people from your side are still going to call them bums and cut the programs.

You'll never hear me saying to cut in the quality of our education system. Heck, the only reason why I'm in university is because of the state spending in this sector.

&gt;Happened nowhere, ever. That would be a prime reason for unemployment not to go down, BTW.

What? The less people there are unemployed and the easier it is to find employment, the easier it is to get an higher wage. There's the bargaining power behind it, if unemployment is high you sometimes either accept the conditions or they won't take you in, if unemployment is low you'll have more choice for employers and they'll have less choice for employees, so yeah, wages/benefits would go up if unemployment went down.

&gt;Which hasn't happened anywhere either without social protection or on a market with very few qualified people.

Wrong, it's just supply and demand of labour.

&gt;I hope you're not talking about private funds, otherwise I'll point to you how it works in practice in the US: their money gets taken out because businesses need the money elsewhere.

No, I'm talking about the laws being different to teachers and policemen and pilot and mayors and sometimes only applying to the last years on the job as opposed to the whole career.

&gt;But I think the issue is solved here with the increase in retirement age, huge decreases in health care quality and much higher costs.

While the retirement age does need to be increased to make it more sustainable, healthcare can remain similar to what it is today. Perhaps the costs less covered by society and more for the user but it won't change much. I don't know exactly how it will go down to be honest, this can be quite controversial as we have an ageing population and they have a very strong vote.

&gt;Sure they can. Just cut whatever offers there are to the profitable ones. You'll get Intercity trains from Porto to Lisbon, most of the metropolitan routes in Porto and Lisbon, but with much less availability, and there you go. So much for mobility and only two cities will grow, but it's profitable. 

Yeah, there needs to be a balance between the money we spend there and the benefit we take from it.

&gt;I'm extremely unconvinced that transportation should be profitable by itself, there's too much people left out. And privatization usually ends very badly, like the train privatization in the UK.

That's an awful example of privatisation, to be honest, that's a natural monopoly and it's hardly regulated. Look at TAP and Ryanair or EasyJet and STCP and Valpi or Gondomarense for a better comparison.

&gt;Yeah, we built some stupid highways that barely look like highways, but that's how big business works.

Some of those only have a handful of cars per hour. Though I wouldn't blame big business for that, they'd only built it because it was profitable for them and the reason it was profitable for them was because Socrates paid them with our money for them to do just that. If people didn't vote for Socrates and his highways, that massive waste wouldn't be a burden in all of us now.

&gt;We may not be talking about the same measures, I don't know. But in the UK and the US, they also say they're too privileged, so I maintain the the end goal for them, not you, is to turn us into China.

Gosh, why can't we be more like Switzerland? They're just fine and dandy, they don't have to cut any spending because they never had much spending to begin with.

&gt;No politician ever wanted that, so never? It doesn't work, anyway. Pharmaceuticals need huge investments from the state. There's no market incentive to stop global warming. In fact, there's not even a market incentive for people not to go hungry, so Monsanto happens.

We're not talking about the same thing, I was talking about companies like RTP and TAP. As for the pharmaceuticals, I don't now about that. As for pollution and other externalities, you just need to regulate them to prevent that from happening (now there's something that can be taxed without a considerable deadweight loss!). As for the hunger bit, there is an huge incentive, Europe for example overproduces every year from 30% to 50% and that goes to waste (fault of CAP and our protectionism, not because of the demand and supply of food not being in an equilibrium).

&gt;He's gone far beyond the deal and plans to go much further. This is a default by another name, the contract is impossible to fulfill. No country has ever tried to pay it like this without a war, and there's a reason for that. 

This whole thing is just sad. I really don't want to emigrate but if I can't find a job or create my own I won't have much choice. :\

&gt;I can believe that. But go watch the TVI report on the GPS group about how it's working these days. Public schools are empty because the students are being sent to the private school next door that rejects the students they don't want. Honestly, the fact that they don't do much better then public schools is pretty damning.

In mine, they couldn't refuse students, probably because it was the state paying for the education of the students in high school, but still, it was the best school I've ever been to and I owe them a lot.

&gt;Sadly, I can't comment. Aren't they in recession too?

Recessions are part of the economic cycle just like expansions are as well. But their recession is a joke when compared to ours.

&gt;They leave because they don't pay taxes elsewhere. Paychecks are so minimal that I seriously doubt how a couple of unfirable bad workers, by your view, would even hit the bottom line of major companies.

It's not just that, it's everything, the labour laws, the mandatory benefits, the tax burden, the bureaucracy, the regulation, the education, the justice system.. all of this needs to change if we are to be committed in reducing unemployment and generating growth.

&gt;Simplifying much? AFAIK, they're growing pretty well after throwing off foreign intervention, even if Venezuela's inflation is mental. 

Still another bad case for socialism.

&gt;Yeah, we're an anomaly, I meant after the Industrial Revolution, the Soviet Revolution and during the cold war. Unsurprisingly, they happened due to fear, because power never cares about the lower classes otherwise.

You're right, that's why we need a stronger and more transparent democracy, to prevent the unbalance of power and to preserve any chance for prosperity for all.

&gt;Right, the Banks, Brisa, Martins dos Santos and so on have all bled profusely since 2008 and haven't improved in profits every year. 

Here I am talking about the benefits of removing barriers to competition to the market and you argue with monopolies. That's not a free market, not even close, that's also the product of government policies preventing competition. You're only giving me reason, precisely because we have those companies that take advantage of their position we have to liberalise the market, so that the ones that succeed are not those who have the strongest voice in government but instead those that are more successful in the market and most benefit society. While there's the restrictions we have to entry in the market, you'll have those distortions and the harm that comes alongside them.

&gt;And it's not like the Troika business is just a way of funneling German taxpayers money into their own banks so they don't get responsibility for the risky deals they made. Oh, that's right, they deal with trillions but had no idea that they were being fooled by Greece and just gambled, sorry, invested unwisely. 

As for the Troika, we can't really complain much as it was Socrates that called them in. If we had kept our budget balanced, they would never be here in the first place.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;As in ~~all liberating ideologies~~ **everything** there are people who aim for personal gain.

There, FTFY. So it's not only in communism and socialism, though in these cases it tends to be worse as the leaders then get to seize all of the power and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

&gt;To see communism as a ploy though is silly.

While it might start with real concerns, genuine frustration and legitimate grievances, it always escalates that, you know how it is, once someone is in charge it's only natural for them to do what they can to benefit themselves. And if you don't think the dear leader is the perfect representative of the people you're a counter-revolutionary, enjoy summary execution for being a traitor.

&gt;And no, economic progress under socialism wasn't negative. The greatest catch up movements were done by socialist regimes wether you like it or not. 

So people starved and there was economic progress? Seems to me you have a very twisted view of progress.

No, there was never any great leap forward in any socialist regime. Not with regards to life quality, I'll tell you that for sure.

&gt;What they want to destroy was the oppressive economic relationships and poverty resulting from it, which they did. Life expectancy increased tremendously in China, just like it plumetted in Russia in the 90s. Before socialism, the future soviet states, China and Cuba were ruled by either absolute monarchs, fascist leaders or foreign sponsored dictators. But yes, democratically speaking few progress was made. But as long as you can't prove that totalitarian governments necessarily follow socialist economies this really doesn't prove anything.

So you moved from a turd sandwich to a giant douche and you're happy with change? How about asking for a stable democracy, fundamental civil rights and freedom of trade? Is this asking for too much?

&gt;I'm not the kind of socialist that denies human nature. But, apparently, a society is possible that seek to ban poverty by force of law, versus societies that accept it. Maybe you prefer the latter, I don't. 

I'm also interested in minimising poverty. I just don't go the easy and inefficient way of outlawing it, of going Robin Hood or of being charitable with other people's money - I know that for you to actually have a chance of minimising poverty, you have to do the utmost to helping the poor getting out of their situation on their own and into one where they can sustain themselves without help.

It's very easy (and inefficient) to take away from those who have a lot and give it to those with little, it actually takes work and commitment to give qualifications to the poor and allow them rise in life for themselves - and this is also the most sustainable way. It's like the old saying, give a man fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

&gt;And what about racism and apartheid? Is that part of human nature, because it certainly looked like it 50 years ago. But then there were states, with the USSR as the avant garde, that proved it wasn't.

Switzerland and a lot of other countries also didn't have apartheid. And they also hadn't massive poverty and lack of civil rights, so it's not like all were shit and the USSR didn't smell as bad, no, the USSR was a massive turd and all the good things you can point out about it also existed in much better places.

&gt;The West used anything except nuclear force in it's fight against communism.

And the East used anything except nuclear force in its fight against capitalism.

&gt;That doesn't mean inherent aspects of socialism didn't made it weak in the 80s, but then you can't also deny that inherent aspects of it made the USSR strong after the revolution till during and after the second world war.

The USSR couldn't fail harder its main goal of building a stable prosperous society.

&gt;You're understanding rest on a simple dychotomy ""socialism bad, free market good"". And while this might be supported by some theorists, while there are also a dozen others, it wont help you understand history.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;If seen in a globalized context (which is always much slower progress as people might think; workers don't simply go work abroad and businesses don't simply move) you could see minimum wages as somehow ""competing"". Though I would still be careful with that because a productive worker in Germany that works for €10/hour will still be more valuable than an €6/hour European who doesn't have the same tools and equipment as Germany. Minimum wage affects overall wage cost, just like many regulations do, but is just a part of the determining factor. The main reason for example why Germany managed to drop unemployment after the Hartz reforms was not because of the absence of minimum wage but because of simply, a drop in wages. Which makes more sense. Compared with Germany's historically high productivity this was pretty effective. Greece on the other hand is one of the most unproductive countries in Europa but kept wages high with debt. Which became a road to disaster.

For someone with Lenin in the username and who is so critical of my views, I don't understand, you're not some blinded ideologue, you actually still have your feet on the ground and think clearly - why do you have your views?

I say this because you're absolutely right.

&gt;And I don't deny social mobility, but it's irrelevant. There's always only one group of people that take economic decisions, and I don't see why capitalist class should be a dirty word, as capital is the basis of their power.

Why do we need to be talking about socialists and capitalists? Why not talk about the people in a democracy? Switzerland can do it with a very direct democracy that leaves very little room for corporatists or communists to take advantage.

&gt;Btw, it's not because we agree on this that I support dropping wages to solve unemployment. Because as a result of economic globalism this means an infinite downward spiral that will only lead to the proletarisation of the middle class.

No, it's about supply and demand. There's no infinite downward spiral, there's only readjustments in the market.

&gt;Is TE's doublespeak really better ? Let's see.

&gt;""bloated public sector"" : bunch of parasites sponging off France's few entrepreneurs (see ""enfants gâtés"", ""France's soul"", Sophie Pedder's book)

&gt;""unpalatable reforms"" : long-term spending cuts aimed at crushing the lower middle-class and the poor, shredding the social safety net(s) in the name of competitiveness (see ""economic efficiency"", ""power of the financial markets"", ""CAC 40 unleashed"")

&gt;Pictures of French people lying on the grass : typical stereotype TE loves to resort to during French election campaigns to remind its readers that the French are still the lazy bums they've always been (see ""Frenchness"", ""the 35-hour week"", ""France is a coutry of Scargills"")

&gt;""Enfants gâtés"" (or spoilt children/brats) : French society - an entiltlementoholic, risk- and work-averse society. Have no clue about the wonders of free markets and untrammeled competition.

&gt;They are a few good apples though. Depardieu for example, who fled to Belgium, then to Russia (""a great democracy"", according to him) to escape Hollande's tyranny. An act of pure bravery if there ever was one. (see ""Bloated public sector"", ""Entrepreneur is not a French word"", ""A sickness of the soul"", ""Social darwinism for the win"")

&gt;French employers : demi-gods in a nation of unbelievers, freedom fighters in a country of self-indulgent slaves.

&gt;""communist-backed CGT"" : one of TE's favorite catchphrase when it comes to French unions. A little journalistic work would show of course that most CGT members, especially in the private sector, are no communists by a long shot, but that would be facts and sometimes TE likes to be just as facts-averse as Fox News. Some would call it fearmongering, but who knows, maybe TE journalists still have an orgasm when they scream ""The coooooooooooooommunists are coooooooooooooooooomin'"".

&gt;""toxic talk"" : racist talk. Generally applies to Sarkozy, whom TE supported twice ""faute de mieux"" (even the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal called Sarkozy ""Nicolas Le Pen"" because of his hateful 2012 campaign). A gross euphemism meant to deflect criticism that the ""prestigious"" TE endorses a racist candidate (see Sophie Pedder's artciles, ""Eurabia"", ""Anyone but an Enarque"").

true,MuffinRat84,null,null,"I studied with ISA in Santander in the summer of 2011. Based on what you want i would suggest Santander. I studied at Universidad Internacional Menendez Pelayo they specialize in summer courses, so they understand that you are there to learn and as well to have fun. Santander is not loaded with tourists, most English speakers are found around the University of Cantabria and UIMP. The city has beautiful not super crowded beaches(Playa Sardinero), and the beach crowd seemed local. Also its located on a ocean natural bay and its surrounded by mountains great natural scenery (northern Spain is very green). 

 The bar and club scene while not dirt cheep is more affordable than Madrid or larger cities. There are a few plazas and down town streets that have people out every night of the week. And if your running low on cash you can always buy your beer at a store and botellón (drink on the street) before you go into the bar, this is illegal but very loosely enforced. Also if your into marihuana, it's legal to posses, but illegal to buy or sell.

I really learned alot about Spanish culture in my summer in Santander, the locals generally seemed friendly to students, prob because they are not bombarded with tourists like many other destinations. Not to mention our ISA program only had like 14 ppl so while I made new American friends I made many Spanish and other international friends.

The downside to the City was that it is a peninsula and the middle is a steep hill. So walking east to west in town involves some intense uphill walks. I lived at the top of the hill so walking home from the bars at night meant walking up 250-300 steps while drunk. (They have a lift that operates during the day) It rains more then the rest of Spain, it rained on average 3 days a week sometimes all day. And the climate can change rapidly usually was between 55-85 , its colder than the majority of the country but still great beach weather when its not raining. 


also i visited madrid, san sebastian, and salamanca all of these places are loaded with americans, especially Salamanca and Madrid, most bars in salamanca the only language being spoken was english

true,mfball,null,null,"My program was actually at a small private school through my home university, not at the Universidad de Salamanca, so I can't really speak about that, though it does have a good reputation and I would have preferred to take classes there. I think they were afraid that we as American students wouldn't be able to keep up in classes with native Spanish speakers, which was annoying.

As far as things to do, hanging out in the Plaza Mayor is usually how people start the night. It's lined with places for tapas or ice cream, then after a while most people head out to the bars, of which there are many. I mostly stuck with the people in my program and a lot of them didn't speak much Spanish, so we didn't venture as much as we probably should have. 

I liked Submarino a couple blocks away from the Plaza because the music was better than most places and one of the bartenders was cute, haha. Irish Rover was also fun because it was usually crowded and had theme nights to draw crowds, but it was mostly full of Americans, so might not be quite what you're looking for if you actually want to practice speaking (bars are mostly too loud for this anyway, but I did meet a local at Irish Rover who I hung out with and spoke Spanish with for most of my trip). 

Some of the bars will have a cover, but if you don't feel like paying it, there's usually somewhere close by that doesn't have one, and you can find super cheap drinks all over the place (like, twelve shots for five Euro) so don't waste money on copas in the fancy bars unless that's really your thing. A lot of the locals don't go out until two or three in the morning, so if you go out earlier it'll often be just international people (read: Americans). You really can party from eleven at night until six or seven in the morning if you want, but it will get old fast if you do it every night, so take a few days to do chill things with friends instead of always hitting the bars or you'll burn out the first week. (That advice makes me sound old and boring, but it's totally true. You'll have more fun if you change things up.) Talk to as many locals as you can and ask them where to go, what to see, what to eat, all of that. 

If you have an opportunity to travel around outside the city (there are usually a lot of side trips as part of study abroad programs), definitely do it. We had a weekend in Lisbon, Portugal, which was great. Got to go to the beach and explore the city a little. We also did a weekend in Granada, saw the Alhambra, and had another beach day. The Alhambra was impressive but Granada in general wasn't really my thing. I've heard great things about it though, so I have a feeling I just didn't look in the right places.

It's also pretty close to France, and some of the beach towns in French Basque Country (Biarritz, St. Jean de Luz) are really cool. 

Santander has a RyanAir hub at its airport, which can take you lots of places around Spain and Europe for cheap. It's also cheaper than SanSe. Santander isn't as walkable as the other choices, but it has a pretty good party scene.

It's very big and overwhelming, and the people will speak English with you no matter how much you insist or speak back to them in Spanish. I loved Madrid to visit, but my experience living in Galicia is much more authentic. I've heard that Barcelona can be similar, but I haven't been yet.

As I mentioned, I live in Galicia, which is a region with its own language besides Spanish. Some people may disagree, but I would recommend crossing Catalunya and Pais Vasco off your list (I've never been) but they also have their own languages. Galicia is known of the three to speak Spanish more than their other language, whereas Catalunya and PV are a bit more hardcore about insisting that you speak the local language. For me in Galicia this has been an issue and it hinders how much Spanish I learn and hear. (I'm learning and hearing a lot, but I'm also hearing a lot of Galician which I have no interest in learning). With a short time like 4 weeks, I would recommend somewhere where the Spanish is authentic and the only language and take day trips to those other places. Again, this is just my personal opinion and it depends on how much Spanish you want to learn/practice.

Of all the places in Andalucia, I've heard the best things about Sevilla and Granada. I've heard Malaga is good for a day trip or a weekend. Granada is MAGICAL. I would recommend that or Sevilla if you're considering the south. Only downside is there is no beach... but Cadiz and Malaga/Marbella aren't so far away if you need to hit the coast up for a weekend.


However, I was in Valencia for a weekend in October and I absolutely loved it. There are some great cheap tapas restaurants-- and in case you get sick of tapas (I did) there are some great cheap restaurants in Valencia. I didn't find that it was expensive at all and they have some great beaches in the area. I really loved it there and would love to go back.


All that said, I don't think you could go wrong with Sevilla, Granada, Valencia, or Santander-- I've heard a lot of great things about Santander, and the north is really beautiful and usually has less tourists than down south (especially in the summer)! However, it's Spain, so whatever you decide you really can't go wrong... it's gorgeous and the people are wonderful. You'll have a great time no matter where you end up!

I didn't actually participate for various reasons -- I just wasn't in the right headspace, as much as seeing everybody else just made me want to jump in. The man I was with and I were there together solely as to allow the other entry to somewhere we'd both been curious about, although of course we acted suitably together-y and would have been more than happy getting close and personal with each other if I had have really felt like it.

I left feeling euphoric, it was quite literally the stuff of fantasies. Walking around in nothing but heels and lingerie, watching and hearing so many others.. wow.

I debunked it with facts and yet you try to lecture me about the EU States and switching to the infamous ""common goals/ideals"" card. Turkey is not part of ""christian religion"" organization in Europe, the only major category that  was missing from my brief list of links. Are you suggesting that a country that is part of any major body in Europe, is not in Europe as it does not have a predominantly christian population? What kind to inseparable links the Irish share with the Greek? You need to decide first: Which one ? Common goals or religion?  

Let me also briefly address your third argument that ""EU seeks a peaceful, war free Europe"" or in other words ""Turkey is the war starting aggressor and thus should not be part of the EU"". Was it Turkey or GB and US started a war in Iraq; invaded, killed +1 million civilians? Whose member states bombed Afghanistan, Serbia, Bosnia, Libya, and only last week Mali? Military intervention, thousands of miles away in Falkland?  Who promised but did not protect the Bosnians in Srebrenica? So much for peace loving EU, as long as the bloodshed is away from them it is OK.
My point is, you come with any argument you want, (Is human rights issue next? Bring it on), if Europe and its people do not start to be honest about the real reason this issue will never be resolved for both sides. To EU: Stop the hypocrisy, admit and declare why Turkey will never be a full member and both sides move on.

* Ils ont un vrai problème de rejet en ce qui concerne le sexe
* On commet l'erreur de leur inculquer la nécessité d'un environnement protecteur au lieu de leur apprendre à encaisser les coups et à aller de l'avant.

Well, there is a particular extremist school of thought in Greece that finds even the reference Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia objectionable (I'm guessin' because it contains those hallowed Greek syllables Macedonia), so they refer to Macedonia by the synecdoche Skopje. The author of this website obviously subscribes to that particular school of thought leading to 86Mitso getting confused as to where the carnival took place. The irony is particularly palpable when you take into account that one of the Greek objections to Macedonia's use of the name Macedonia is because it would cause confusion between the Republic, the Greek region and the wider geographic-historic region.

the right to ""marry,"" is it not equally unfair to deny
living individuals the right to attend their own ""funerals""?

She tried to be as neutral as possible on the subject, assigning books like the pro-imperialist Niall Ferguson's Empire, while also assigning books that took a decidedly colder take on colonization such as Philippa Levine's The British Empire: Sunrise to Sunset.

Regardless of her official neutrality, upon speaking with her personally I found that she had very strong feelings against the British in Ireland and openly referred to Ireland as Britain's first (or test) colony.  Historians with a positive bias toward the UK tend to deny that Ireland was really a colony at all and instead paint it as just another part of greater Britain, while historians on the Irish side unabashedly claim that the Britons were colonizing Ireland.  As far as I can tell, both sides have a good case, but being of Irish extraction myself and being much more exposed to the Irish point of view, I can't help but side with them.

If you are born in Northern Ireland, you have a right to choose British citizenship, Irish citizenship, or both.

&gt; I doubt that EU membership could ultimately protect the UK from an inevitable eurozone power grab.

This doesn't stack up with the desire to leave the EU. Leaving the EU would make us even less likely to be able to protect London.

This argument is a giant non-sequitur. It argues that EU membership doesn't make us strong on point A then fails to mention that non-membership makes us even weaker on point A.

If protection of the financial markets is the be all and end all it is much easier to do that inside the EU than outside.

The article also dances around the white elephant that most sceptics are ignoring. The EU and EEA are an imperfect trade zone. Theoretically there is free trade. In reality there are subtle biases in favour of EU members.

&gt; Member states are part of a customs union and, of course, an unfinished single-market project, one that has stalled long before it has been completed.

The article almost hits it on the head there. The EU is not a natural free trade zone. It is one that says it is and realistically discriminates against the EEA and even more so against people outside. The WTO has spent decades trying to make the EU follow free trade agreements.

true,MySuperLove,UNSA,United States,"I guess I feel like I'd owe her an apology because I laughed at the mischaracterization of the relationship between England and Ireland.  After reading about the anti-Catholic Anglicans proselytizing, the laws preventing the catholics from owning land, the horrible stereotypes (including the Irish as drunks, when they drink less than the English!), 
the famine, Cromwell's brutal conquest, etc, I feel like the English have horribly abused the Irish.  The Irish rebelled against the English, understandably, and the English punished them by sending them to America, Australia, etc.

The English calling the Irish ""rascals"" horribly misrepresents the reality of the history between the two nations.  It stereotypes England's historical view to an almost comic level, which is funny.  At the same time, I feel bad for laughing at the British dismissal of their acts against the Irish.

But I am an Irish-American, not an Irishman.  The American conception of Irish-ness is stereotyped into drinking green beer, dancing jigs, and showing up at St Paddy's day parades.  The Irish conception of what it is to be Irish is incredibly more complex and includes regional differences (like how California is culturally different from Texas, I imagine Cork is culturally different from Limerick, etc), political affiliations, regional sports affiliations, and any number of other factors that help to create a person's sense of identity.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;**It does not really matter if Britain leaves**
&gt;
&gt;*The idea of the UK at the heart of the EU is bizarre*
&gt;
&gt;Should the UK remain at the heart of Europe?
&gt;
&gt;If you believe that this is where the UK is actually located, then the answer may well be yes. But then you would either look at it from a very long distance – the US state department for example – or suffer from perspective distortion.
&gt;
&gt;Looking at this from inside the EU, the UK left the heart of Europe 20 years ago when John Major negotiated the opt-out from the euro. Tony Blair confirmed that position when his government took the opt-out in the later 1990s. It is completely unsurprising that there is now a debate inside the UK about membership. People are asking themselves a perfectly logical question: since we are not in the eurozone, nor likely ever to become a member, what is the point?
&gt;
&gt;In macroeconomic terms, EU membership is virtually irrelevant for a member state that is simultaneously large and not in the eurozone. The EU budget is tiny, and free trade and free capital movement would continue under any conceivable scenario. There may be reasons to stay in the EU, but whatever they are, they are not macroeconomic.
&gt;
&gt;If you go one level down – to the level of individual industries, including finance – the impact of EU membership is more subtle. But here it is important to take a realistic look at how the EU itself will develop in the next 10 years, and not romanticise the liberal, free-trade EU of the past, when Mario Monti or Lord Brittan were still European commissioners.
&gt;
&gt;Over the next 10 years, the EU will mostly deal with the institutional consequences of the eurozone crisis, deepen eurozone integration, and change European treaties to make that possible.
&gt;
&gt;In the agreement on banking union, the UK has secured a protection from being outvoted on matters relating to bank supervision. But the eurozone will find a way to usurp this and other single-market powers. A hint of that recently came from Christian Noyer, governor of the Bank of France, when he said the eurozone would not allow the City of London to dominate euro-related securities trading forever.
&gt;
&gt;I doubt that EU membership could ultimately protect the UK from an inevitable eurozone power grab. A single market in a single-currency regime is a very different beast than a single market in a customs union. In the first category the purpose is adjustment of wages and prices; in the second it is free trade. Italy needs a single European labour market. The UK does not.
&gt;
&gt;What, then, would the UK leave behind by leaving the EU? Membership confers a series of fundamental freedoms – of movement of labour, goods and services and capital. Member states are part of a customs union and, of course, an unfinished single-market project, one that has stalled long before it has been completed. Britain may be able to maintain several of these benefits: not the customs union, but most of the rest.
&gt;
&gt;The common foreign and security policy has not lived up to the exaggerated expectations of the past decade. Even here, it may be possible, and in everybody’s best interest, to maintain some form of engagement and co-operation. But is it important enough to make a compelling case for continued membership?
&gt;
&gt;What about the UK beneficiaries of EU funds – universities, for example? As a net contributor to the EU’s budget, the UK would be able to compensate any institution, and still have some money left.
&gt;
&gt;A genuine complication would be a prior decision by Scotland to leave the UK in a referendum that will most likely take place next year. Any hypothetical UK referendum would happen afterwards. If Scotland were to vote for independence, the situation would get messy. The legal services of all the three main EU institutions believe that by formally leaving an existing member state, a region would also formally exit the EU. Like any European country, Scotland would have the right to reapply, but any one member state could veto a Scottish application. I cannot currently see the required unanimity for admitting an independent Scottish state, not when other countries, such as Spain, are also fighting regional nationalism.
&gt;
&gt;The two straightforward solutions would be: Scotland leaving the UK, and both the rump-UK and Scotland also leaving the EU. Or Scotland staying inside the UK, and the UK staying inside the EU. But we could end up with England inside and Scotland outside, or vice versa. In the last two cases, England and Scotland would have to re-erect a customs border between them – which would be absurd.
&gt;
&gt;The best reason to stay in the EU is not a pretence to be in the heart of Europe, but to keep things simple, and maybe to have the flexibility to change one’s mind about the euro later on – if the political or economic situation were to change. But in that case, the UK could always be readmitted, so even that is not a compelling argument.
&gt;

It is within the purview of the EU, as demonstrated in 2007 when the Commission gave a notice to France to allow remote gambling as they were doing what Belgium is currently doing.  It's pretty clear that the EU is being remiss in actually enforcing its own rules, when countries are repeatedly engaging in behaviour that they're already issued notices about.  In other words, a failure of the EU to combat protectionist tendencies amongst its members.  Even the situation in France is still not fully resolved, with the law there favouring state-owned gambling companies at the expense of operators from elsewhere within the EU.  Another failure to regulate the market and stamp out protectionism on the part of the EU again.

But let me ask you this: even without a concrete example to hand where the Commission has already given notices in the past to EU members for exactly the same behaviour, how could this possibly *not* fall under the purview of the EU, given it directly affects the single market?

You're right, I didn't think of this when I made the previous post; there has indeed been plenty of struggle between the (Somewhat) Normanized Irish and the (Somewhat) Normanized English.

This is the real problem with the whole concept of free markets with retaliation based enforcement. Small economies like Switzerland can make use of them because they only have to play nice in the one zone that forms their market advantage. The WTO doesn't allow cross market retaliation. Large economies like the EU, US or China can absorb retaliatory measures because those regions are approaching autarky. Provided there isn't a total shut out they can handle the draw backs of occasional spats. The EU doesn't care about retaliation against CAP.

Well, the Agreement on Agriculture still allows for a great deal of protectionist policies, there aren't really any rules being broken there. The Airbus Boeing spat is a good deal more complicated than that, it involves a series of challenges and counter challenges that governments as the EU and the US try and shift things around so they conform to the rules without actually changing anything. Nevertheless, the WTO, for example, forced a gift of land to EADS to be changed to a sale so that EADS had to pay for it following the ruling.

No one can ignore the WTO. What happens instead is that a country will knowingly enact a law which has a bit of wiggleroom for debate about whether its illegal or not, and then they ultimately get struck down and the winning party is allowed to put in place countervailing duties (the retaliatory measure you spoke of). This doesn't happen with the CAP, because the CAP isn't breaking WTO rules.

Ce n'est pas exactement le cas : ils ne comprennent pas dans quelle mesure les arguments visant à accepter l'un ne permettent pas d'accepter l'autre.

&gt;Dois-je expliquer en quoi c'est intellectuellement malhonnête et stupide ?

Absolument ! Il existe de nombreuses sociétés dans lesquelles ces comportements ont été acceptés (même s'il existe des règles contre l'inceste dans toutes les sociétés, ces règles ne comprennent pas forcément la prohibition de l'acte sexuel ou du mariage entre parents). 

Si notre culture tolère l'un et pas les autres c'est uniquement une différence de degré et pas de nature. Sans vouloir rentrer dans les détails la question de l'attirance et des interdits sexuels est une chose extrêmement complexe et le procédé de ""tabou"" intimement lié à la représentation de la famille dans le groupe. Tu peux trouver des illustrations de ces propos tant dans l'analyse de Freud (complexe d'Oedipe) que dans l'anthropologie (je pense à Levy-Strauss).

&gt;Plusieurs civilisations ont admis l'homosexualité comme naturelle et tout à fait acceptable et pour certaines il y a plusieurs millénaires.

Pareil pour la pédophilie et l'inceste (pédophilie dans la Grèce antique, inceste dans l'Égypte ancienne).

3. For some life in a box may be preferable to death.

From there you can easily go on mini trips to Seville, Cordoba, Malaga and Almeria (go to the Cabo de Gata national park)

The other places in my opinion:

Seville: just too dam hot, but it will also be a great place to stay, maybe a lot of tourists. Lots of historic places to see, the river is beautiful, good food, and you can easily travel to Madrid or Cadiz.

Salamanca: never been there, but it's got a huge college population that for what I understand is replaced in the summer with abroad students, so you might find yourself in an international crowd more than a Spanish one. But you should check with someone from Salamanca. 

 Santander: small, it has a ton of Spanish people that go there for the summer, in my experience is a more family friendly location than others in the list.

 San Sebastian: never been there.

 Madrid: My city! maybe too big, but the real great places are almost all in the center, maybe a 3km radios from puerta del sol. In summer people tend to go away, so some nights (thinking of a Wednesday) you have to know where to go to find a place that is full. It's really hot but dry. It's a great place, lots of nightlife, even in weekdays. If you go and want to avoid tourists avoid Huertas at night (or just simply avoid it, it sucks) There is a ton of things to do and places to visit, I think it would be one of the places where you can pack your timeline more and have things to do non-stop. There are a few places where you can get both the big city atmosphere and the ""barrio"" one, I'm thinking malasaña, chueca, barrio de las letras...

 Barcelona: Only been there once but the things I've said about Madrid are applicable, it's a great city with a ton of options.

Nonsense post, nonsense response.

&gt;I've spent a lot of time in Northern Ireland and a lot of my family live there. I was merely attempting to politely explain why your assumption that automatically calling people from Northern Ireland British was incorrect. 

Never assumed this, in fact I stated the exact opposite. (Which is what started this) when you stated that the people in Northern Ireland were not British. Specifically this statement:

&gt;Watch how you word things though as saying for instance that you lean more towards British than Scottish would annoy people in the UK from Northern Ireland as although they are part of the UK they aren't British.

See? And that's why I said you shouldn't label the entirety of the population of Northern Ireland as either Unionist or Republican because there's a divided community.

&gt;My suggestion though would be to go and read some books and make sure you actually know what you are talking about in future before you correct someone else.

If anyone here needs to work on their reading comprehension it's you. It seems like we basically agree here but instead of turning around and saying you could have worded something better you just blurted out a stream of nonsense.

The decision explains the joining of applications.

&gt; 3 - The applicants complained that domestic law failed adequately to protect their right to manifest their religion. Ms Eweida and Ms Chaplin complain specifically about restrictions placed by their employers on their wearing of a cross visibly around their necks. Ms Ladele and Mr McFarlane complained specifically about sanctions taken against them by their employers as a result of their concerns about performing services which they considered to condone homosexual union. Ms Eweida, Ms Chaplin and Mr McFarlane invoked Article 9 of the Convention, taken alone and in conjunction with Article 14, while Ms Ladele complained only under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 9.

&gt; 4 - On 12 April 2011 the application of Ms Chaplin was joined to that of Ms Eweida and the application of Mr McFarlane was joined to that of Ms Ladele.

I've actually heard the quote ""Why should I pay the tax, so we can buy another sunken submarine?"". Even before the crisis people used to take the moral high ground to justify the tax evasion. Or as the saying goes ""I'd rather buy peanuts and feed the pigeons, than pay that"". It is very difficult to turn such a society into tax payers.

War is fought to win, you don't fight for the sake of it. If you are going to lose you don't start a fight. We have huge alliances the size of which is unprecedented. NATO and the EU, not to mention the Commonwealth make up half the planet, the only two other nations capable of starting or ending a war are Russia and China. Russia despite putin is pushing forward in a non aggresive manor (which cannot be said for the US or even the UK). China is becoming more and more liberal, slowly admittadly but it's getting there, starting a war would be the dumbest thing any large nation could possibly do.

Finally the US defence system is built for defence gainst the middle east not Russia or China. Both countries have long range missles easily capable of bypassing the Patriot system. If Russia where to randomly invade tommorow they would flatten half of Europe regardless of the US troops stationed there. Until the Middle East or Africa seriously united in an Islamic republic there is no serious threat to Europe (You can be damn sure that's not going to happen anytime soon).

China doesn't want to and cannot invade Europe, Russia could but it would result in everyone on the planet dying, the UK and probably France have submarines permanantly patrolling the worlds seas. In the event of a nuclear attack they would nuke whoever launched it.

We start paying 30 % tax on around €2000/year- it is impossible to live on that in Sweden, just the food costs much more. (we are the most expensive country in the EU, or the second most, after Denmark). So, we pay taxes when we can't afford it, as well. 

&gt;There are many households now that their only option is to evade or starve. 

Well, yes, I can understand that, but frankly, from what I understand, the Greeks have been evading taxes since, well, I guess since you became free, as you very correctly point out.

But don't you see - not paying taxes is corrupt too - by you (as in you the person who don't pay the taxes, not sokolobo). That is cheating, lying and contributing to corruption as well. One has to start somewhere, why not start with being honest and paying taxes?

Yes, the Greek have a corrupt system, but all  are a part of that system, and being a tax cheat is aiding to corruption. I do wish you deal with your corrupt system (as I am sure the Greeks wants it much more than I do)but cheating isn't the way. The thing is also, I wonder why you have built such a system, and not tried to change it before, the crises. It is not news really, not to any Greek I have ever met. 

Also, the only one who can change the system is the Greeks, not anyone else. Is it always like that, one has to make the changes oneself (but then they become better). I think I am just having a hard time feel sorry for the Greeks, tax wise (other things I can emphathise with) when we always pay much more, no matter how one calculate.

A mon humble avis, dans l'affaire Depardieu comme dans celle du mariage gay, la droite essaye de regagner en crédibilité et de descendre Hollande par la même occasion. Depuis les élections à l'UMP, il leur fallait un cheval de bataille pour détourner le regard de leur petites affaires. 
Depardieu est populaire, il quitte la France à cause de la politique fiscale de Hollande, donc c'était couru d'avance que l'opposition allait s'engouffrer là dedans.

true,StevieTV,SCOT,Scotland,"I'm being very polite in my responses and I'm merely trying to educate you a little. However you're becoming increasingly rude with each subsequent post. So I'll attempt to explain this one more time.

What I originally said was worded correctly. People living in Northern Ireland are not British. To be British you need to live in Great Britain. Northern Ireland is not in Great Britain.

Great Britain is an island made up of Scotland, England and Wales.

The full name of the United Kingdom is actually the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

As you can see from the name the United Kingdom is made up of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 

The people of Northern Ireland live on a different island to Great Britain.

That island is called Ireland which is made up of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

So although Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom it is certainly not British. The entire island of Ireland is made up of different counties. Some of these counties are in Northern Ireland and some are in the Republic of Ireland. There is also a county called Ulster which is part Northern Ireland and part Republic of Ireland.

There are people in Northern Ireland (Loyalists) who call themselves British. There are also people who wouldn't be offended at being called British.

Do you even know how it came to them to use our name? Here's some brief history lesson. 

The Skopjans (I shall henceforth call them South Swedes so as to not be inflamatory) were really Serbs that came to speak Bulgarian in the crazy ass mess of the Ottoman Empire. 

The Ottomans let people move around the European part of the empire, and politically divided them based on religious denomination rather than nationality.

So you could be a Greek speaking Bulgarian and being commanded by a Serb priest, or a South Swede speaking Bulgarian and commanded by a Greek priest. The term Macedonian didn't really mean much other than the ancient Greek tribe in that kind of environment

The problem with the South Swedish was that they were Serbs but Serbs didn't like them cause they spoke Bulgarian. At the same time Bulgarians didn't like them either cause they were not really the same nation. After the Balkan Wars and as the situation was beginning to clear they were to be integrated either to Bulgaria or Serbia. Tito the dctator tried to coax them by making some bullshit story about them being a different nation related to the ancient greek tribe. South Swedes all bought it cause they were a bunch of pussies with no culture of their own. Greeks didn't get mad cause Tito - Greece and Murca made some kind of deal that the name was for internal use only.

Then after the disolution of Yugoslavia Skopjan South Swedes started busting our Macedonian balls with their inane historically unfounded cold war propaganda. They went abroad and spent money on political campaigns of presidential candidates in the US and the UK. And took advantage of the general ignorance about the Balkan area and the anti-greek sentiment. So instead of being called South Sweden as they should they steal our name and they can fuck right off.

&gt;Russia despite putin is pushing forward in a non aggresive manor

Right now. This year. I mean to ignore the whole invading Georgia and stealing their land thing, why do you think your (or anyones) understanding of geopolitics is sufficient to account for events a decade from now? Following WW1 we disarmed, we started rearming properly in about 1938, after years of people saying that war was an impossibility, and that we had no need of an army. Well did, didn't we?

What's happening *now* is not hugely important, what happens in 5, 10, 20 years - that's what's important. And a military can not be built in 36 months, but a war can be lost in that time.

&gt;Finally the US defence system is built for defence gainst the middle east not Russia or China. Both countries have long range missles easily capable of bypassing the Patriot system.

Actually, not bypassing it, saturating it. That's not really relevant to conventional warfare though.

&gt;If Russia where to randomly invade tommorow they would flatten half of Europe regardless of the US troops stationed there.

Probably not actually, their military right now is in pieces, it's not now you need to worry about with them, it's 25 years from now.

&gt;there is no serious threat to Europe

There is no serious threat *today*. That doesn't mean there won't be one tomorrow. Who would have predicted WW1 in 1900? Who would have predicted WW2 in 1930? Who predicted the Falklands War? No-one. Not a soul. Yet it went from peacetime with no soul predicting anything, to serious wars, in very little time at all.

Britain must be prepared. Europe must be prepared. All of this semi-informed geopolitical prediction you do is completely pointless, we have the best generals and stategic minds working on stuff like this, and they all say the same thing: you can't predict the future, prepare for as much as possible.

I'm open to the possibility that there will never be a full-scale war, but I think people who claim it are being laughably naive indeed. You have no idea what the future holds. Neither do I. People assume that because Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Brazil aren't major threats today, that they won't be in 10 or 20 years. This *is* naive.

They had another room with all the weight stuff- my roomie's bf liked to lift and stuff and he was always in there - but honestly I didn't really go in there so I can't remember what machines they specifically had (sorry) but from what I remember they seemed well equipt. They also had a pool (way over chlorinated), a little playground for kids, a bar with smoothies.

The trainers were nice and helpful and I'm sure if you contact them they'll be able to tell you about their machines or at least when you get here you can go on a tour.

To be honest, I live outside of the city now and I've never lived in the nicer parts of the city (I've moved around a lot) and the more working class gyms have the more normal equipment you'd be looking for.

The *pijo* type  gyms would probably exist in the nicer areas and when you go to shops to buy exercise equipment you do see those ridiculous vibrating machines but the trend has really died down - I personally have never seen those machines in the 3 gyms I've been to.

First, don't assume I'm against a universal right for civil union, I'd gladly support suche a measure if it's really universal and with no hazardous consequences such as hat I mentionned earlier.

Another thesis, still not related in any way to what you may call fanatics, is the impact on society, and how does one benefit from destructing traditions inherited from cultural foundations.

Creating too much uncontrolled changes (like binding this falsely named ""mariage pour tous"" to adoption and MAP) will lead to some people loosing their grounds. Social evolution is slow, and my point is that a forced-evolution has an adverse effect like resistence to change and enpowering either political or violent opposition.

While the civil union (PACS) is now well established and accepted, I think it would have been much more acceptable to enhance it progressively than to alter a cultural symbol in the name of an unwanted equality (I still believe most concerned persons realy don't give a shit about this form of civil union, so does most of my gay entourage).

Here's what I'd do in a 5 to 10 years period (time needed to pass, enact and for the society to accept such reforms) :

* Assemble the laws defining both mariage and PACS under the same civil-union definition, but keeping them separate at first.

* Adopt fiscal reforms to raise the PACS to the same benfits than mariage

* Establish a mean for consented adoption and transfer of administrative parenthood between consenting designated people, in respect of the children's will and interests

* Rewrite most bills enacting positive discrimination and penalizing negative discrimination to stronly penalize any form of discrimination, including any discrimination regarding children of gay parents, with aggravated circumstances when such discrimination would be endured in a public service and/or scholar environment

* Create a clear distinction between biologial parents and tutors / adoptive parents (this confusion having a strong history of medical errors due to inadapted treatments based on unknown filliation)

* Re-enact the right to abandon a child at birth anonymously, and considering the previous, keep only an anonymous link to the biological mother's medical data.

* Criminalize any form of human traficking including private intermediation in foreign children adoption, thus creating a state-run entity to permit such adoptions while protecting children from any abuse

* Establish laws to prevent any form of commerce of the human body (mostly tagetting outsourced pregnancy)

Then, and only then, would there be a real equality in rights, and could the formal mergure of traditional mariage and civil union be acceptable by a divided society.

No, see:

&gt;My suggestion though would be to go and read some books and make sure you actually know what you are talking about in future before you correct someone else.

That's not polite, that pretentious bullshit especially coming from someone who is incorrect.

&gt;What I originally said was worded correctly. People living in Northern Ireland are not British. To be British you need to live in Great Britain. Northern Ireland is not in Great Britain.

Well sure, unless you want to discount law and international agreements concerning border control. As someone has already said, check your passport. It doesnt say Scottish it says British. Citizens of the UK are called British. You don't need to be from Great Britain to be British that's an arbitrary label you yourself have applied.

On your line of argument I could label Irish people as British just because they live in the British Isles.

Honestly, all you have here is your own arbitrary labelling and it doesn't make any sense. 

&gt;But to use that term is incorrect and you would be very stupid to do so if you ever went over there and didn't know who you were talking to.

We partly agree on this, the term isn't incorrect (as stated above and in a seperate reply where someone else has already explained this to you) but you wouldn't label someone as British or Irish in a situation where it's unknown if you will cause offense.


If you don't want rude replies to you comments please refrain from posting things that are incorrect and quite frankly stupid. You're mixing personal preference with reality and doing it in a pompous manner which is even more infuriating due to the content of your comments.

&gt; Yeah, basically, outside of adoption/PMA of course, this is what is at stake. People do not want a ""separate but equal"" system. Yes it's a symbol, and people want it to change.

Well, it will change at some point, but you can't change everything in just one bill : it's too violent and wrekless to be accepted.

&gt; Why ? Not only there are already lots of gay couples with children (but legally, nly one of the couple is the parent), and experiences from abroad who legalized adoption for gay couples do not show any harm for the children.

I guess I didn't explain the problem fully, but the problem isn't about adoption by gay parents in itself, it's about how adoption currently (doesn't) work in France, how it's moving to an internationnal traffic, and how such children must first be protected against any form of discrimination, mostly by changing educators and teachers habbits, prior to allowing these adoptions. The last part is the main reason why the reform must be splitted in several bills passed along the years as the educational system takes a very long time to evolve.

Plus, marriage and PACS have already been separate for much longer than the 5 to 10 years period you propose. Not slow enough for you?

There is no ""traditional marriage"" in the eyes of the law. There's just civil marriage and it doesn't bear that weight of cultural symbol and tradition you are so touchy about.

true,chiwawa_42,null,null,"There are two diferent points in your answer.

First, the timing issue. The law assumes homoparentality is decent, normal, and should not be subject to critics in any case. Let's assume that's legitimate and consider the state of mind of most person a child will be confronted to. Let's say teachers, nannies, other parents... The time delay is necessary to ensure that mentalities evolves and the child won't have to endure homophoby or any other special treatment caused by others's perception of its parents. I think that a few years time between a reform of anti-discrimination laws and wide acceptance of homoparentality is necessary. And even with a respectable amount of time, it may probably never be accepted by all.

Next, the consideration for traditional views and words used to define social interactions. I think that for most people, mariage is still a synonym for the project to build a familly by procreation. Seriously, would you wed if your a convinced /r/childless/ reader ? The main reason why not only traditionalists and religious people, but also normal parents are shocked by the idea of allowing gay people to marry is the simple fact that gays can't procreate together naturally, therefore their mariage would be unnaturall and even disrespectful for those straights who ar still attached to the founding values of our nation. MPA wouldn't change that as the resulting children will not carry both of their parent's DNA in any case, therefore never have a relation with both their biological parents.

(note that by nation, I mean France as it was born as a kingdom in the 6th century, not by the 18th century hipsters. France today is still attached to the values that made it a united nation centuries ago, and not just the fake democracy designed by the 18th century's elite. Those values are inherited from christianity and cannot (should not ?) all be thrown away without risking the loss of a nation's unity an strength)

But let's say we d'ont care of any consequences and ar as short-sighted as our politicians seems to be. Let's pass this bill and be done with it. What will it mean for a normal citizen ? Well, (almost) **anyone can now marry and buy a child** (remember, there's no more way to legally adopt a child for free). I don't know about you, but it sounds abject to me, like whipping our asses with the human rights declaration and children rights declaration all at once. So does many feels.

As for children of separated straight couples, living with a gay parent and its concubine, well, the child still have two separated parents and another adult taking part in its education. No need for adoption here, a simple transitivity in parenthood rights through a formal declaration, combined or not with a civil union, would be sufficient.

Even if it's the right thing to do, considering we can't fight evolution and progress, it makes one wonders if it's really going the right way, doesn't it ?

So, the best way to decently keep roots in the founding values, i.e. not to jeopardize the nation's stability for one more bad reason, is to keep both unions possible but separated in meaning to those who still wish to keep them distinct. Then, in a few decades, we may consider the distinction has become hypocritical and meaningless, and then decide to merge both status.",0,1358269120,null,0,false,0,c7xd0jm,t3_16hs2o,t1_c7xd0jm,t1_c7xbgd5,null,1435643576,0,false,france,t5_2qhjz,0

That's because it is.

Change has to come from somewhere. Homosexuals may never be totally accepted. In fact, I'm pretty sure they'll never be. Is this an excuse for stagnation? Denying homoparental children legal acceptance just feeds into the cycle of social unacceptance. It's circular reasoning: ""we don't want to accept them because they would suffer from us not accepting them"".

We're not making an experiment here; children *are already* being raised to healthy adults by same-sex parents, and [those who give their testimony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7INyZLJyjw) make it clear that they just want the legal recognition.

&gt;the simple fact that gays can't procreate together naturally, [...] resulting children will not carry both of their parent's DNA [...]

This has been shown time and time and time again to not be a valid point in defining what a family is. I am honestly tired of responding to this argument.

&gt;buy a child

Now you're not being reasonable. Such blatant propaganda really has no place in a healthy debate.

&gt;No need for adoption here, a simple transitivity in parenthood rights through a formal declaration, combined or not with a civil union, would be sufficient.

This I would agree with if it makes the process easier for gay couples who raise children together. It shouldn't be used to argue that it's useless to let gays marry however.

Un autre truc qui me fait hurler, c'est la perception d'une homosexualité choisie.

Powers *are* tooling up, and have been for several years. The far east is also all developing rapidly militarily, India is developing various bits and bobs, the technological gaps are closing.  I can actually accept the notion of only tooling up when other nations are doing so too, so long as you stay on the ball (which we're not, but if we did) then that works as a solution.

However we don't do that, and the UK is very acutely awful at this part, we frequently grind down our armed forces more and more and more and more until eventually we're thrown into a war, scrape through it (WW1/WW2/Falklands) and only then accept that hey, maybe it might be a good idea to have a powerful standing military - of course this is forgotten within a few years and we start hacking away at defence left right and centre in order to have more money for bread and circuses.",0,1358285576,null,0,false,0,c7xin43,t3_16kh1t,t1_c7xin43,t1_c7xidqx,null,1430971823,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I'm from Málaga and my GF is from Granada, so I know pretty well both places. User ax0ne has explained Málaga pretty well, so almost nothing to add there.

I might be wrong, though, but I will suggest going to Atica or ZZ Pub anyway, they're mainly rock, but cool places nonetheless.

One important thing: if you don't drive, you're gonna have a bad time. Transport is not very good down here. If you only plan to visit big cities such as Granada or Málaga you shouldn't have a lot of trouble, but forget about visiting small, charming villages (and it's a pity, we have plenty).

And last, if it is a honeymoon, I'd suggest Granada instead of Málaga, it's way more romantic. Anyway, in a week you have plenty of time to visit both.

true,erkurita,null,null,"Here's one you can try, my personal way:

* Dice up real small the potatoes. Something around 1.5 cm but not too small
* Deep fry them BUT only for a bit, not all the way to crispy! They must not get anywhere near brown. When you see they start to get white after soaking up a bit of oil, that's the spot.
* Break some eggs in a bowl, stir them to break the white but not too much otherwise the soft, fluffy texture will be gone. How many eggs depends on how many potatoes you are preparing. A good mixture would be when the potatoes, once fried, are soaked but not completely engulfed by the eggs.
* If you're vegan, skip this part. This a personal touch: I like to add 1 chorizo, diced up slightly bigger than the potatoes, the skin removed beforehand. Add it when the time to remove the potatoes off the oil is getting close. The potatoes will be coloured by the chorizo and if you do it early enough, they will soak up the color as well. The problem is that, if you add the chorizo with the potatoes they will be way too cooked and crispy and you don't want that.
* Ready a pan and get it as hot as possible. Have a small amount of oil at hand and towel paper. Doesn't matter if it's a non-sticky pan but it's preferred. Otherwise you need to get it *really hot*.
* Take out the potatoes and drop them right way inside the eggs and quickly mix. Coat the pan with the oil and drop the mixture inside.
* Even it out and move the pan around so the eggs at the top cook properly.
* Shake the pan a bit and when you feel it's loose, ready a plate large enough to flip it. Do so and put it back in the fire for the same amount of time.

This will give you a tortilla that is a bit raw in the inside. The hotter the pan is when you put it, the rawer it'll be since the outside is cooked enough it won't break when you flip it.

Du übertreibst maßlos. **Wer** sind denn **die**, die sich den Süden schön reden? Die gelben Engel? Hast du das von einer repräsentativen Umfrage? Was sind denn Drecksstädte? 

&gt;Aber die Wahrheit ist, dass der Süden von Nazis zersetzt ist in jeder Ebene der Gesellschaft.

Zersetzt? Wenn du damit meinst, dass es auch im Süden welche gibt, ist das schon richtig, aber zersetzt ist dann eindeutig nicht das richtige Wort dafür. Ich sehe hier weder Nazis, noch offenen Ausländerhass, von gelegentlichen Demos und Gegendemos mal abgesehen.

Ins Naziland? Was ist das für eine Bezeichnung? Wo liegt das Naziland? Und wer hat es dazu erklärt?

&gt;In München müssen Schwule in einem ehemaligen KZ heiraten.

Na wenn das keine Diskriminierung von...ich weiß auch nicht wem, ist...Der Faschismus in Deutschland ist überwunden, und das ist gut so. Das ist ein Stück Geschichte vor dem man die Augen nicht verschließen braucht. Wie du also darauf kommst, dass man Schwule ""abschiebt""/diskriminiert, ist mir nicht ersichtlich. In der Kirche können sie ja scheinbar nicht heiraten, ist es also nicht vielmehr gut dass sie endlich einen Ort bekommen ihren Lebensbund offiziell zu machen?

Da gibt es nun zwei Interpretationsmöglichkeiten: Du beziehst dich auf gesamt Deutschland, und darauf dass eben nicht nur im Osten/Mitte/Norden Nazis vertreten sind, sonder auch im Süden, also im kompletten Staat. Möglichkeit Zwei wäre, dass du einfach nur sagen willst dass der Süden von Deutschland einfach scheiße ist. Wieso das so sein soll, hast du dabei allerdings vergessen zu belegen.

So, vielleicht ist das verständlicher als mein erster Post, der dazu anregen sollte darüber nachzudenken: Was meint der denn damit, dass ich übertreibe?

Brown, however, was solely worn by the Nazis, and none of the notable parties following them claimed it as their own color. Mainly - and I say this from a position of knowing a lot of right-wing folk - because even nationalists perceive the Nazis as either lunatics, idiots or traitors to the German idea. It's just not right to name all of them 'brown', because to many right-wingers, it's an insult to their beliefs. (Just take famous revolutionary Stauffenberg, for instance - to call him a Nazi during the final phase of his revelation would be ridiculous, but he certainly was a nationalist, militarist, elitarist radical.) And while I do not agree with many of the opinions of the Right, a neutral point of view is **the** essential condition for anyone to build a thought-through opinion of their own, which such a simplification makes very hard to do. It's contrary to each and every basic thought of democracy and Enlightened Europe to employ tired battle rhetoric like the one above, because it purposefully obfuscates whichever actual belief those parties hold. Thus, they are giving way to ""PI"" opinions that are able to claim ""truth"" by pointing out the obvious shortcomings of such naive and / or deliberately misleading statements. One of the main claims of the NPD since their existence has been that their opinions are being oppressed by ""the man"" - do you actually think that people will dismiss that argument when their opinions are _actually_ being repressed, which is happening right now? If Germany were to enter actual neutral democratic discourse with the NPD, they would soon be laughed at like the small-minded fools many of them are, but denying them the right to said discourse - ESPECIALLY leaving the Landtags during their democratically mandated speeches like our officials do! - just proves to their voters that what they preach is actually the truth. It is shameful that there is a consensus in our country that a party which has gained nation-wide attention is to be denied any rights to converse with anyone simply because their opinions is not fashionable, although a significant percentage of our population voted for them.

That is true in quite a lot of the countries that seem to have long stay at home periods according to the map, including the UK and to a lesser extent in Germany (Largely due to the length of education, but even then the upper bands of 25-34 seem excessive).

I don't know many people from my generation (and that should include people in the 25-34 bracket..) in the UK who are still voluntarily living at home at 25, so it seems odd and somewhat counter to what I would see as the norm or even socially acceptable.  Although whilst some proportion of people seem to move back home after University, many also stay wherever it is they went to university.  Those that do complete university education also then seem to move out when they get work (so maybe youth unemployment is playing a part in driving that statistic up). Conversely those who don't do higher education also seem to manage to leave home fairly early and start working early... As a personal example, I left home at 16 and everyone I went to school with and kept in touch with was out before they were 19.

I (apparently incorrectly) would have assumed that anyone living home in their early or late twenties as and not in education as being a bit of a burden to their parents, after all, at that age if you are working there is no good reason to be living at home.
