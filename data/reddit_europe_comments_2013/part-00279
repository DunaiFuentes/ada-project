true,slytherinspy1960,UNSA,United States of America,"First of all, let's dispel some myths. The first myth is that all Latino Americans are catholic. In fact 23 percent of Hispanic Americans are protestant. Another myth is that minorities are more socially conservative. On some issues (gay marriage and abortion) that is true but on others such as immigration, the death penalty, and the legalization of drugs that is not true, not to mention economic issues. So it definitely is not a clear cut thing. Now, White catholics are more likely to vote Democrat, the more liberal party, than white protestants (they are also more likely to be in favor of gay marriage, legalization of abortion, legalization of drugs, abolition of the death penalty, lenient immigration policy, and pretty much every social and economic issue out there). Latino catholics are more likely to be liberal than Latino protestant on all the issues mentioned above as well. I would posit that the reason that Latinos are more conservative on issues such as gay marriage and abortion is not because of their Catholicism but rather on a larger reliance on religion in general and a more traditional family outlook. I will assure you though that catholics within each ethnic group are more liberal than the protestants as a whole. Though I will also make note of the liberal protestant groups, though small in number, such as the quakers and the Universal Unitarians. Lutherans are pretty middle of the road. The largest protestant denomination are southern Baptists however, not exactly the most liberal of denominations, followed by Methodists, Church of God, and National Baptist convention.",0,1387782491,null,0,false,0,ce8c5xc,t3_1thrnd,t1_ce8c5xc,t1_ce8b9up,null,1428018765,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  On some issues (gay marriage and abortion) that is true but on others such as immigration, the death penalty, and the legalization of drugs that is not true, not to mention economic issues. So it definitely is not a clear cut thing.

I think there are (at least) two factors at play here. The general level of religiousity as TheApatheist said (compare, say, Southern Italy to the also Catholic North, there's a big difference), but also the various flavours of Protestantism you mention are composed very differently than in the US. Protestants in Europe are predominantly Lutherans, in some regions various Calvinists and of course there's the Anglican church. Evangelicals, Baptists, Methodists etc. are rare. For Catholicism, there are Roman Catholics of course, but there's also the Eastern Orthodox church in some regions.  

The big difference here is the centralised teaching. I'm not sure about all of them, but at least Catholic and Lutheran priests should have theology university degrees, and they tend to really know their stuff, about other religions as well. Even as an Atheist I find it interesting to talk to them, and I learned a lot about how Judaism basically was a best-of of other religions in that region, or about Feuerbach et al. in Catholic religion class in school.  
Those structures are capable of adapting to scientific knowledge. The Vatican doesn't have a problem with Evolution, and if you've seen their Chief Astronomer on the Daily Show you know they've already got an explanation up their sleeve in case we ever find intelligent life out there. It keeps them somewhat pragmatic and moderate, and more aware of the core teachings like compassion or forgiveness that appear to play a much lesser role in some of the more radical Protestant denominations that are more common in the US.

The separation of church and state is another issue. I think it was a global Pew poll, but I can't find it right now (sorry). Anyway, what was striking was how even the most religious countries in Europe (like Ireland, Poland and Italy) didn't at all think it was important that political candidates were religious, while responders in the US predominantly thought it was. So, while the US is big on keeping church and state separate on an institutional level, society likes their religion and politics mixed up.",0,1387786291,null,0,false,0,ce8d1wg,t3_1thrnd,t1_ce8d1wg,t1_ce8c5xc,null,1428018351,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

To me is exactly the contrary. How the legalized exploitation of women can be a progressive policy? And why are you surprised about regulated prostitution in Turkey? In Muslim countries is fairly common: you'll find [many brothels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Tunisia) in north Africa.

In Italy we had regulated brothels, but in 1949 the proto-femminist and socialist [Lina Merlin](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legge_Merlin) (in Italian) decided to ban brothels and abrogated all the laws that regulated prostitution. She followed the example of France's [Marthe Richard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marthe_Richard): an ex prostitute then a politician, that worked towards the closing of brothels in France in 1946.

In that map - imho - pink countries are progressive countries. In Germany, Switzerland and Austria I found a conservative policy in act, not a progressive one.

you mean exploit your obsession with punishing yourselves for it? I agree that anyone could be like Rwanda, however, that is somewhat besides my point. I'm not arguing for you to pretend that the past never never existed(though it seems to work for Japan).

When you spend so much time saying ""oh the Europeans did this and that"" it implies that there are others who did not, which is incredibly incorrect. Do you know how many people scream about whites/Europeans being the cause of all wars, problems, etc. etc.? All of your nonstop talk about your own ""sins of the past"", while others get much less attention and/or don't care to feel guilty about anything, is akin to dropping your gun while no one else goes along with it. You're attracting the criticism of hypocrites, and accepting the nonsensical idea that there was something you did that gives them the right to attack you personally today.

People bitching all the time about how much Africa was colonized, when almost every nation was colonizing something. Plenty of the Africans were killing each other, selling each other into slavery, etc. and yet no massive guilt circlejerk seems to appear for that sort of thing. It only comes up in context of the ""white mans burden"", and then we're back on the ""evil Europeans"" track, that or you're racist for even bringing it up. Apparently those who were more successful back then deserve more of the blame or something.

Not to mention the whole it wasn't anyone alive now thing, yet the guilt trip still seems to apply, beyond just a simple history lesson. There's not much to be said there, as it's completely illogical, or at least inconsistent if you can't also take credit for every good thing ever been done(which no one ever seems to think enough about to have a consensus on).

What? We... don't... do that.

&gt; shouting

I can partially confirm this. It's really common to hear people speaking loud, but only usually people that are selling stuff - like people who sell fish or vegetables in a market (not in the supermarket or anything like that). Other than that I can only think of Italy, for example, where people are known to speak quite loud - I've never really experienced this and think it's a false (and uncommon tbh) stereotype.

&gt; suddenly stopping in the narrowest paths to talk to somebody

Umm... Maybe, I don't know. Old people are usually chatty and tend to talk with their neighbours a lot - maybe that's it.

&gt; never hesitate to ask

To ask what?

&gt; sticks their nose in random stranger business

I don't think so. This happens everywhere - I think it has more to do with the persons themselves rather than with the country you're in.

&gt; touch without warning

I can't really relate to this. Only if you're referring to our habit of kissing as a form of greeting - only between two women or a man and a woman, though; never between two men (unless they're like father/son).

&gt; people actually spend hours on-end sitting at cafes and just casually relaxing, whereas the cafe-culture in Denmark is sort of not so relaxed, easily shown by me finishing off my drinks, and meals etc before everybody else at the table, like not even just a little before, but a lot before.

Also true here. The Spaniards take it to a whole new lever with their *siesta* after lunch. Here in Portugal it's also common - especially in the South (in Alentejo).

&gt; the nonstop folk-music and folk-dancing everywhere and at all times, and between all age-groups

We do have folk music but no one ever dances it. It's basically just a tradition in villages.

&gt; Also people living with their parents until they get married, which is also usually at somewhat old age (around 30 from what i've observed), and the family-bond also seem to be tighter than in Denmark in general. This is also probably more just a general southern-european thing aswell, more than specific to Macedonia.

Completely true. This happens in pretty much all Southern Europe - I'm actually an exception to this but yeah, it's pretty common to see people in their mid/late twenties living with their parents.

&gt; Also religion seems to be a bigger part of life, and most people are more spiritual than is the case in Denmark. Taxi-drivers doing the sign of the cross when driving past graveyards always struck me as odd.

Religion is a HUGE thing to the elder. When considering young people, though, this is not case whatsoever - at least here in Portugal teenagers and young adults are either atheists or non-practising catholics (is this even a word?).

&gt; Everything being super cheap

Not so much in Southwestern Europe (Portugal, Spain and Italy) but it's definitely true.

&gt; People not caring much about people smoking, or kids/young people drinking alcohol (well not getting drunk obviously).

Definitely not true. Smoking is banned indoors and in public places. About young people smoking/drinking it's basically the same as in Northern/Central Europe.

&gt; Crazy traffic, people driving like madmen even in curvy mountain-roads. Coming from a very flat country with people driving somewhat more reasonable i feel very fragile in most foreign countries traffic.. :P

Somewhat true. Completely true for Italy. Anyone who's ever been there knows that drivers don't care about crosswalks.

&gt; People being way more open, friendly and welcoming. In Denmark people just live in their own sphere while outside, minding their own business. In Macedonia its not hard getting involved with other people.

Completely true. One of the things I hate the most about Northern/Central Europe is the fact that they're generally not as friendly, welcoming and open.",0,1387794420,null,0,1387839233,0,ce8efa0,t3_1thaji,t1_ce8efa0,t1_ce832ca,null,1428017711,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

C'est pas la criminalité qui est un problème inexistant (et encore, les homicides et crimes violents sont en constante baisse depuis pas mal d'années, c'était une récente étude des nations unies si je ne m'abuse), mais le fait de répondre à la criminalité par des armes à feu!

Le coup du protecteur de la veuve et de l'orphelin tout plein de bonnes intentions qui ne veut que défendre son bout de fromage contre des hordes de barbares sanguinaires je suis désolé mais ça n'existe que dans l'imaginaire des candides manipulables.

Tu dis que t'as changé 3 ou 4 fois de bord politique en l'espace d'une paire d'années, ce qui prouve encore que t'as pas tout à fait atteint ta maturité.

For instance recently in the UK weve had the fallout from the Lee Rigby guilty verdicts. It was the Muslim community organisations who condemned Adrian Choudhury (a radical fringe element in the muslim community), most importantly they condemned the BBC for giving him unchallenged airtime and allowing him to appear to be speaking on behalf of muslims. This happens again and again with the Oxford paedophile rings and other incidents, criminal behaviour is criminal behaviour.

My main point and disagreement I suppose is that allowing the discussion to get dominated by ""Muslims never integrate"" or similar blanket statements is both wrong and pretty dangerous in the same way as saying ""Homosexuals dont integrate"" or ""Jews dont integrate"".

We have the [BKR](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_Krediet_Registratie) wich means Bureau of Credit Registration. They keep a file on every Dutch person. Banks, lenders and other companies have to do a credit-check at the BKR before they are allowed to lend out money to people. Every Dutch person has a 'credit profile' there. This bureau's goal is to make sure people don't take out too much loans and financially drown themselves. 

&gt; ""Cashback"" are bonuses given to you for spending. For example, on my AmEx card (the only card I could transfer over to the UK for various reasons), I get 1.25% of every purchase immediately refunded to my account. If you do the math, that means I only have to spend ~£2000 annually on the card to match the annual fee. Anything over that is a refund. They're given to incentivise spending, but as long as you keep your spending habits unchanged, you can definitely use it to your advantage. When you pay with debit cards, on the other hand, you're not building up any credit or getting any sort of rewards for your spend.

Because our debit cards are issued by banks and not by payment-services companies they build in incentives to save money in stead of spending it. And individual shops have loyalty programs like Airmiles etc.

true,CaisLaochach,IREL,Ireland,"As a lawyer who knows a fair bit about common law (what with being Irish and all) I can offer one or two suggestions. 

At a basic level there is a dislike in England (Britain is a complicated subject) of Europeans 'meddling' in their affairs. It's an ingrained thing, probably a hang up from going from being numero uno in the world to now being tied for 7th place with the Italians. (I jest, but it's worth comparing the two states in terms of size, influence, etc.)

The more fundamental reason, however, is politics. In Northern Ireland, the authorities famously allowed people be interned without trial, the government likely operated death squads (SAS shoot to kill policy, for example) and they also essentially allowed a state be organised along the lines of an apartheid state in the North. THe ECHR doesn't allow things like that. From a Tory perspective, up until John Major or so, most Tories wanted Northern Ireland in the UK no matter what. Do what it takes. Similar methods as used in Malaya, Kenya, etc, were all hunky dory. Now you try and send a lad like Abu Hamza back to a country where he'll likely be tortured and killed and you're not allowed. You aren't allowed torture brown people until they confess to being suicide bombers, etc.

Now, none of this is a reflection upon normal English people, but the retards reading the Daily Mail et al lap this sort of shit up. It's a very jingoistic subset of the population, and they hate the EU more than normal people like the EU.

The rich were separate from the poor, there was no economic competition. The few rich were regarded as a different kind altogether, and everyone else was ""narod"" (""the people""), poor and leading a difficult life, but it was ""like everyone else"" -- and that's much more important than being able to buy a car or whatever, people managed to be happy in the jungle, the soviet union was nothing compared to that, it's all about how you feel about your life. This WAS a good thing, equality among *almost* everyone. Obviously, it had huge downsides as well, don't take me for a communist ha hah.

I know there was a huge difference between Nomenklatura and the people, but it's exactly why it worked psychologically, ""the people"" were all together, they were the normal contingent, those other ones were of a different kind, just like clergy and peasants in the past. Nowadays it's all about how well you do personally, not about how difficult life is for everyone. 

For someone that got out of that era, the modern world would obviously not feel good, especially since they're in no way prepared for a world where personal initiative and education are the greatest perks -- that's exactly what they had the least.

Doch was die Medien nicht berichten: Der »politische Häftling« ist mitnichten ein unbescholtener Geschäftsmann. In den Zeiten des wilden Kapitalismus in den 1990er-Jahren hatte er großen Einfluss auf die Regierung Jelzin und kam mit äußerst fragwürdigen Methoden zu unfassbarem Reichtum. Auf der Suche nach den tieferen Beweggründen für Chodorkowskijs Verhaftung im Jahr 2003 setzt Viktor Timtschenko das Leben des Oligarchen wie ein Puzzle neu zusammen. Er nimmt dessen Geschäftsgebaren unter die Lupe und zeigt dabei die genialen Schachzüge des Senkrechtstarters auf: Von Steuerhinterziehung über Scheinverkäufe bis hin zu Morden, die nachweislich mit Chodorkowskijs Konzern Jukos in Verbindung stehen, ist alles zu finden, was einen aufstrebenden jungen Mann auf dem Weg zu Geld und Macht voranbringen kann.

&gt;  So please keep your bad history to yourself. 

[Allow me to quote Wikipedia on the matter:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system#Readjustment)

&gt; Postwar world capitalism suffered from a huge dollar shortage. The United States was running huge balance of trade surpluses, and the U.S. reserves were immense and growing. **It was necessary to reverse this flow. Dollars had to leave the United States and become available for international use. In other words, the United States would have to reverse the natural economic processes and run a balance of payments deficit.**

&gt; The United States set up the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan) to provide large-scale financial and economic aid for rebuilding Europe **largely through grants rather than loans.**

&gt; From 1947 until 1958, the U.S. deliberately encouraged an outflow of dollars, and, from 1950 on, the United States ran a balance of payments deficit with the intent of providing liquidity for the international economy. Dollars flowed out through various U.S. aid programs: the Truman Doctrine entailing aid to the pro-U.S. Greek and Turkish regimes, which were struggling to suppress communist revolution, aid to various pro-U.S. regimes in the Third World, and most important, the Marshall Plan. From 1948 to 1954 the United States provided 16 Western European countries $17 billion in grants.

&gt; Bretton Woods, then, created a system of triangular trade: the United States would use the convertible financial system to trade at a tremendous profit with developing nations, expanding industry and acquiring raw materials. **It would use this surplus to send dollars to Europe, which would then be used to rebuild their economies, and make the United States the market for their products.** This would allow the other industrialized nations to purchase products from the Third World, which reinforced the American role as the guarantor of stability. **When this triangle became destabilized, Bretton Woods entered a period of crisis that ultimately led to its collapse.**

(emphasis mine)

To sum up, every single point you made is wrong. The amount of loans you quoted is wrong. Your claim that everything was in repayable loans is wrong. Your insistence that this reversed flow of capital ended in the 1950s is grossly inaccurate. My claim that the US kept sending their surpluses to Europe until the end of the Bretton Woods era was correct.

For a while you could watch stores and restaurants close on a daily basis. Which isn't surprising, as they were practically empty of any customers. Many people have returned to the countryside, as life there is cheaper and at least offers something more than hopelessness. Tourism is the only thing that keeps this country alive. Though due to the global recession tourists have become rarer as well.

I never experienced any hostility towards Germans. In fact, the Greeks believe that Germans look down on them and condemn them for the crimes of the fat cat bankers. The Troika is in control and ordinary people feel that their democratic rights are being ignored. A general hostility is very present, though. Weimarer Verhältnisse, quite literally. Extremists are murdering each other in the streets of Athens. Riots are even more frequent and much more violent than they used to be. 

Frankly, I don't recommend going there right now, at least not in a non-tourist fashion. Not because of safety concerns but just because urban Greece (at least Athens) just isn't a nice place to live at the moment. The country is incredibly poor, think 90ies Eastern Europe.

Im Kern wollen Banken weiterhin Geschäfte machen dürfen, deren Risiken sie der Gesellschaft aufhalsen. Denn sie weigern sich, den zentralen Sicherheitspuffer ihrer Bilanz – das Eigenkapital – auf eine sozialverträgliche Höhe zu bringen.

Warum weigern sich die Banken so hartnäckig? Ganz einfach: Wegen des „Hebels“. Dieser Zauberstab des Fremdkapitals vervielfacht bei geringem Eigenkapital die Renditechance gewaltig. So etwas mögen die Banker. Denn dann können sie sich hohe Gehälter zahlen und saftige Boni gönnen. Aber der Hebel wirkt leider auch in die andere Richtung; er vervielfältigt die Verlustmöglichkeiten. „Ist nicht schlimm“, sagen die Banken – und reichen die Verlustrechnung einfach an die Allgemeinheit weiter. 

Die Banken heucheln Demut. Doch wahre Demut bestünde darin, für mehr Eigenkapital zu sorgen. Das aber scheuen sie wie der Teufel das Weihwasser. Hartnäckig wehren sie sich gegen die Forderungen der Ökonomen nach höheren Sicherheitspuffern. 

Bei der Deutschen Bank betrug noch im Frühjahr 2013 das Eigenkapital gerade mal 2,1 Prozent der Bilanzsumme; das ist weniger, als Lehman vor der Pleite 2008 hatte
Im 19. Jahrhundert waren Eigenkapitalquoten zwischen 25 und 40 Prozent (!) durchaus üblich. Und die Wirtschaft blühte. 

Aber wie viel Eigenkapital wäre angemessen? Normale Unternehmen im Dax haben im Schnitt eine Eigenkapitalquote von 25 Prozent. Die Industrie hat das übrigens, weil die Banken selbst es verlangen als Sicherheitspuffer für etwaige Kreditausfälle. 25 Prozent Eigenkapital wären auch für Banken das Minimum, findet Ökonom Fama.

Was also tun, wenn die Banken nicht freiwillig ihr Kapital erhöhen? Dann muss man sie zwingen. Kann eine liberale Zeitung das wirklich fordern? Ja. Gewiss, Zwang ist ein schmutziges Wort, um noch einmal den Nobelpreisträger Fama zu zitieren. „Rauspauken (Bail-out) ist aber noch viel, viel schmutziger.“

We have developed a complex communication system to deal with this. It's based on the liberal honking of your car horn to warn anybody that might potentially be getting in your way that it is, in fact, *your* way. It also produces a beautiful cacophony of sounds that turns your brain into pudding in about 5 seconds when you hit a major road.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Pardon me for being fuck-all drunk, but the problem with this view point is that it assumes that the people you're dealing with (on the civilized side of things) are mature and good enough to roll with it. That is, they're mature enough to NOT attribute things to your physical appearance. The truth of the matter is, our world is still very divided on ethnic lines, and thus, visual lines. Thus, there are a lot of people who are too stupid to realize that just because someone looks one way, that doesn't mean that they have the culture of that group. 

In this lies the root of racism: a particular culture can be attributed to one's visual appearance, and vice-versa. Or so many people think subconsciously. As I've stated, ethnic lines still fall on visual lines, which corresponds to cultural lines falling on visual lines, to a certain point, by the definition of an ethnicity. Thus, on a subconscious level, many people will automatically ascribe a foreign and often negative culture on people who look a certain way, such as ""arabic."" To finish this thought segment, this leads to racism against certain visual appearances.

The problem with the reality I've outlined is, many people are too intellectually lazy to discern between those who do and do not follow that ethnic culture. There are plenty of people who are totally westernized, even if their physical appearance betrays that fact.

No, not all cultures are equal. But most people are too damn stupid to realize that eventhough because a person looks different, they might just be apart of the same culture you are.

As you can see, from this interpretation of the situation, the only real fix to this source of racism is time. With time, more people will see that those who integrate into society can be of a certain visual appearance, and thus, they become a part of the ""norm."" This is how integration in the US works, btw: slowly over time, the non-English became synonymous with mainstream culture, and so racism was lowered against those visual profiles. Man, it is complex to describe... Too much wine. Great wine, but too much wine.

Anyways, racism bad, homogenous culture not bad, acceptance of those who look different optimal but considering humans not to be expected, ignorance bad, etc etc.

Now if you don't mind, I need to go pass out now from too much wine.

Genau, und deswegen fände ich es gut wenn in Artikeln über Chodorkowski neben anderern Dingen auch deutlich auf seine Vergehen hingewiesen wird. Ansonsten besteht die Tendenz, daß Chodorkowski beim Verfassen solcher Artikel zu positiv dargestellt wird. Nach dem Motto: Chodorkowski  kritisiert den Kremel (das System), also ist er ein ""Guter"", dann lassen wir mal die negativen Aspekte seiner Vita (Taten, die auch nach westlichem Maßstab Straftaten sind) im Artikel unerwähnt.

Durch Weglassung von solchen Dingen wird IMHO ein zu positives Bild von Chodorkowski zum Leser transportiert.

I believe women are self determined enough to decide for themselves if they want to become prostitutes or not. Banning something just to achieve some arbitrary moral goal is the opposite of progressive.

I think curtailing someone's right to do something has never worked to improve their quality of life.

&gt; And why are you surprised about regulated prostitution in Turkey? In Muslim countries is fairly common: you'll find many brothels in north Africa.

&gt; In Italy we had regulated brothels, but in 1949 the proto-femminist and socialist Lina Merlin (in Italian) decided to ban brothels and abrogated all the laws that regulated prostitution. She followed the example of France's Marthe Richard: an ex prostitute then a politician, that worked towards the closing of brothels in France in 1946.

Wait, are you saying that outlawing prostitution is the correct thing to do, because some feminists managed to get it banned in their respective countries in a fit of outrage? The Feminists being involved does not automatically make this the right course of action.

""However, **the idea that “ordinary people” commit murder just because they happen to have a gun handy is a myth; in fact, “murderers are highly aberrant. They tend to have lifelong histories of felony, extreme violence, and other hazardous behaviors (toward themselves as well as those around them), including car and gun accidents, substance abuse, and psychopathology.”** [Randy E. Barnett &amp; Don B. Kates, Under Fire: The New Consensus on the Second Amendment] Women who live with violent intimate partners should not introduce a gun into the home, but could leave one with a trusted neighbor or in a safe-deposit box at their bank in case they need it in an emergency. A household comprised of law-abiding, mentally healthy, reasonably prudent people is not at any great risk for a “heat-of-the-moment” murder simply because there is a readily accessible firearm. “ **There are no homicide studies finding that most murderers—or many murderers, or even a few murderers—are ordinary sane people who killed in a moment of passion.** The dozens of homicide studies dating back to the Nineteenth Century invariably show the overwhelming majority of murderers are long-time criminals with long prior records—and the rest are mentally deranged.” [Kates, supra note 47, at 89.]""

true,TheGodBen,IREL,Ireland,"&gt;I am very aware why it's a different country. However I am just not entirely sure it should be nor that it is worth it.

A brief list of reasons off the top of my head:

1) The most obvious positive of independence is that we get to write our own laws to suit our interests. Ireland strikes me as a more socially conscious society than the UK, especially whenever you have a Tory government.

2) We get to negotiate for ourselves at the EU and other international bodies. We obviously don't have the same sort of influence that the UK has, but having our own seat at the table has been beneficial on many occasions.

3) Our small military allows us to redirect funds to more important things, such as education. It also means we don't get involved in quagmires in the Middle East.

4) We don't have a monarch. I know most people in Britain like having one, but we don't. It also appears to me that, somewhat ironically, our media tend to be more respectful towards our President and his family than yours are towards the royals.

There are things in the UK that I wish we had, such as the NHS, the transportation network, and the BBC. And there are things in Ireland that I dislike, such as some of our socially conservative laws. But on the whole, I feel the advantages of independence significantly outweigh the disadvantages. Besides, our two countries have a pretty good thing going right now, the relationship between our peoples has never been as positive as it currently is, so there's no point in messing with the status quo.",0,1387805005,null,0,false,0,ce8g0aj,t3_1thaji,t1_ce8g0aj,t1_ce8e4ao,null,1428016900,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Killings by other means than firearms is a ""rare occurence"" ?..

&gt;Adding guns on the mix to fix something that rarely happens

No. Arms in the hands of law-abiding citizens creates too much a risk for most violent agressors, they will refrain from taking it. And for those who do, the chance of a successful defense by an armed victim is much greater.

&gt;I don't even see why else you should arm yourself.

**Read my book**, you'll get plenty of reasons.
But to give you an a quick answer :
- because owning a gun is non-violent endeavour in itself, therefore you should have a right to own one. The very fact that I own a gun doesn't agress against anybody.
- because most thugs are younger, faster, more violent that most people. Guns enable the physically weak to have a chance to defend themselves. **Guns are the great equalizer.** Gun are not only useful to defend yourself against an armed attacker.
- because all genocides in the 20th century were made on peoples that were disarmed

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; China is still far down the list of emissions per capita.

But not in absolute terms. Why should they get free emission passes because they have a large impoverished population? That only incentivizes to keep poor people poor, so the wealthy regions of the country can use up their allotment.

We're not going to argue that China shouldn't be allowed to develop, so it's a moot point anyway: they'll be raising these emissions as soon as they can.

&gt;Why should they have to spend considerably more on green technologies to cut carbon emissions

Because it's they who emit.

&gt;when Western countries are already rich and could afford to do it for their own emissions.

One could argue as well that Western countries are also democratic and are therefore more constrained in their policy options. Or that putting that burden on them would simply shift the economic activity to countries that don't have that restriction, so that you simply move the economic dominance without affecting total emissions.

&gt;They should slow down the development of their living standards because the West has already polluted so much and got us into this place?

They also use Western technology, don't they? That argument cuts bot ways.

Look at these:
http://www.davekimble.org.au/peakoil/news/emissions.htm
http://www.efchina.org/FNewsroom.do?act=detail&amp;newsTypeId=1&amp;id=107

China will overtake the USA in cumulative emissions within decades. And that's just counting CO2, rice paddies emit quite a bit of methane too, a greenhouse gas that's much stronger.

Naturally, everyone's going to argue for the accounting method that benefits themselves (a few masochists aside). I have a way to solve that conundrum:

- All countries, without exception, reduce their *current* emissions. If they need to develop, they have to do so greenhouse-neutral; if they already are, they need to replace their infrastructure and organization as necessary.

- All countries, without exception, will do sequestration in proportion to their *historical* emissions. This effectively makes them clean up the mess they made in the past. Obviously there will need to be a kind of discount, because people didn't know the harm at first, and most benefits from past emissions are long gone.

This allows to account for both the past, the present and the future without giving anyone free passes.

Tu ne me connais pas, merci de ne pas balancer des critiques non respectueuses sur ma personne.

&gt;pour toi elle sauve ses enfants, pour moi elle les met en danger

Elle les met en danger en les protégeant ?.. J'ai du mal à comprendre.

&gt;Le but du braqueur n'est pas de leur faire du mal, mais de lui piquer son pognon

Qu'est-ce que tu en sais des intentions de l'agresseur ? Déjà, qui te dit que c'est un braqueur qui l'attaque, et pas quelqu'un qui veut la violer, qui veut faire du mal à ces enfants, un fou qui veut le tuer ? Ensuite, même si ce n'est ""qu'un"" braqueur, qui te dit qu'il ne va pas la violenter, la blesser au passage, elle et ses enfants ? Enfin, même si il ne compte que voler sans causer de dégâts physiques (et ça, tu ne peux pas le savoir à l'avance, tu n'es pas dans la tête du braqueur), est-ce que cela veut dire que la femme doit juste se laisser faire, lui tendre l'argent et repartir tranquillement sur son chemin ? 

**Ce que tu sembles croire c'est que les armes ne sont un outil de défense que quand on les utilise, que quand on met une balle dans l'agresseur. C'est faux. Aux US, dans 80 à 98% des cas selon les études d'usages défensifs d'une arme, aucune balle n'est tirée. Le seul fait de brandir l'arme fait arrêter ou fuir l'agresseur. Quand une balle est tirée, elle n'atteint pas forcément l'agresseur. Et quand c'est le cas, elle ne tue pas forcément : une balle d'arme de poing qui tue automatiquement, c'est que dans les films ça.**

&gt;Si un 1er braqueur se fait descendre, tu penses vraiment que les suivants vont abandonner l'idée

Oui. Les braqueurs sont des humains comme les autres et ont peur pour leur vie. Ils font des calculs coûts-avantages. Quand les coûts potentiels sont trop élevés, ils s'abstiennent.

&gt;plutôt que d'acheter un flingue et de tirer dans le tas au moindre mouvement suspect de la part ?

C'est un fantasme ça. Regarde la réalité, intéresse toi aux Etats-Unis, tu découvriras que ça ne devient pas juste le far-west où tout le monde tire sur tout le monde quand les citoyens honnêtes peuvent porter des armes.

Sulla libertà di stampa e di opinione facemmo un'interessante comparazione con l'America.

Noi e gli Americani abbiamo un a diversa idea di ""slippery slope"", con una radice storica. Per loro, la slippery slope ha come protagonista il Governo: dagli un potere e se lo prenderà tutto, diventando dittatoriale.

Per noi, la ""slippery slope"" ha come protagonista il popolo stesso, ignorante o meno. Lascia che idee come razzismo, negazionismo o omofobia corrano libere per la società, e non sarà più possibile fermarle, fino ad arrivare a dittatura aggressiva.

Gli americani non hanno questa concezione in quanto la loro società dimostra ogni giorno di avere gli anticorpi contro queste idee. Quando un presentatore radiofonico recentemente fece dichiarazioni razziste, furono privati cittadini e associazioni a picchettare per MESI la radio,e a chiamare incessantemente gli sponsor della radio stessa per protesta. La radio licenziò il presentatore per pura pressione di privati cittadini. Se ci fossero buuuh razzisti negli stadi americani, succederebbe la stessa cosa.

In Europa, e in Italia soprattutto, avete forse visto privati cittadini marciare contro il razzismo, negli stadi o in altri luoghi?Contro i maltrattamenti a Lampedusa?Se è accaduto, certo non ha avuto la stessa intensità e insistenza che avrebbe potuto avere in America. In America esiste una dialettica accesa e proattiva delle diverse parti sociali. Da noi, molto meno.

Noi confidiamo la salvaguardia dei valori allo Stato per due ragioni:

It's how the law is, you are limited because the legislator thinks it's what is the best for the society, maybe it's not perfect, maybe we could change it. Because you can use this argument with everything. Owning a nuclear bomb doesn't mean I want to use it, but you don't have the right to own a nuclear bomb. 

&gt; - because most thugs are younger, faster, more violent that most people. Guns enable the physically weak to have a chance to defend themselves. Guns are the great equalizer.

Are you sure a physically weak can safely use a gun when under attack/stress ? Assess the situation and act in the best way? Does this mean you need to have a permit system, with mandatory practice? A Medical/psychological evaluation? How do you decide who is fit to carry a gun?
What about other the other self defense weapons that you can legally buy? Is a pepper spray not better for a weak person?

&gt;Gun are not only useful to defend yourself against an armed attacker. - because all genocides in the 20th century were made on peoples that were disarmed etc etc etc.

Yes you are right but I think we don't have to worry about genocides in France right now. Because if we have to fear for genocide, we should also fear a nuclear holocaust or something nasty and star building bunkers and stock food.

&gt;Owning a nuclear bomb doesn't mean I want to use it, but you don't have the right to own a nuclear bomb.

Oh god, the nuclear bomb argument. I was expecting it, I'm surprised it didn't appear earlier. There will be a part about that in my book, please read it. Short answer : nuclear bombs don't have any legitimate self-defense purpose.

&gt;Are you sure a physically weak can safely use a gun when under attack/stress ? Assess the situation and act in the best way?

""Sure"" ? No. Are **you** sure that they can't ? You can't make such a big statement in advance.
But I do think that most physically weaker people would be able to do both, yes. Thinking otherwise is very arrogant : ""they're helpless"" : no they're not. They just lack the strength to defend against an attacker, and guns provide them that.

&gt;Does this mean you need to have a permit system, with mandatory practice?

That's up for debate. I do think that it would be necessary, at least in the beginning.

&gt;A Medical/psychological evaluation?

Same, that's up for debate. You do have to find a way to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally-ill. How do you figure that out ? I don't have a clear-cut answer, I think nobody does.

&gt;How do you decide who is fit to carry a gun?

Nobody. As long as :
- You're more than 18
- You have a clean record (no violent endeavours)
- You received a training to safely handle firearms
- You're not mentally ill
You should be granted a permit.

&gt;What about other the other self defense weapons that you can legally buy? Is a pepper spray not better for a weak person?

No it's not. Pepper sprays are far from being as efficient a tool for self-defense as a firearm, it has a lot of shortcomings.
And anyway, that's not for you to judge. Weak persons are still adults, they should make their own choices.

No, that's 2 very different matters. Nuclear holocaust is much more unlikely, I think.

That is why people go to court, to get the kind of fair, evidence-based hearing she would apparently never get in /r/europe merely because she is an American, and we all know how crafty and litigious those Americans can be!

Now I don't know how you folks do things over there, but no one in this thread seems to be willing to acknowledge that this woman has a right to a fair hearing. It's all, ""Oh, she's so stupid, you should know better than to fall into a gap wide enough to fit a human being, it's all her fault and this is a stupid frivolous lawsuit."" The prevailing attitude here seems to be that she shouldn't even bring a case.

This woman lost her legs, and she believes it was due in part to an unsafe train platform design. If any of you were willing to acknowledge even the slightest benefit of the doubt to her claim then you must also acknowledge that at the very least, a train that has started moving when a human being is on the tracks has not performed its duty of care for the safety of its passengers.

Is it not possible for two parties to be at fault for an accident in Europe? Is that the European attitude towards fairness? ""LOL should have minded the gap, you stupid American!""

A lot of the time the complaint says the amount of damages are not known at this point, but are no less than X.  After more is learned, the plaintiff will fill a document with the amount they actually believe is due.  This case is the very very early stages.

Now lets say this woman found a very gullible jury, and they award her a ton of money, the train company could make motion to the judge after, saying the jury made a mistake.  This happens all the time, and the judge reduces the amount.  They vould even make a motion to say the jury totally effed up, and they owe the woman nothing.  These aren't granted all the time, but it does happen.

Another thing people in Europe may not realize is that a lot of the time it is the insurance company suing to get the money they paid out back.  So lets say you visit my house and burn it down by accident.  I put in a claim, insurance companies pays me, I rebuild my house.  As far as I concerned, you and I are even.  But my insurance company is not happy with you, and they sue you to get their money back.  The case would actually be in my name, but the insurance company is the one pursuing it, I would have almost no involvement.  Even if you were my best pal on earth, the insurance company has the right to sue you over my objections.  And this is where a huge amount of litigation comes from. 

Things are much more complicated than people realize, and sometimes people in /r/europe who are not familiar with our system think they are experts.  Hell, I would never pretend to know what is going on in a Civil Law jurisdiction.

Die Alternative war ein Konjunkturprogramm in ähnlicher Höhe wie die Bankenrettung. Und die Banken wären pleite gegangen. Das hätte natürlich viel Vermögen verschoben. Aber diese Verschiebung hat auch so stattgefunden. Nämlich durch die Banken. Davon wäre viel wieder zurück gekommen. Aber so eine große Vermögensumverteilung bringt halt viel Instabilität mit sich. Und große politische Systeme mögen solche Verschiebungen und Instabilitäten nicht. Man stelle sich vor, dass die meisten Banken nach und nach (Domino-Prinzip) alle pleite gegangen wären.

Then you need to define a category of weapon that can be used for ""self defense"" or can be carry around!
Shotgun? revolver? fully automatic? sniper rifle? Can you buy a silencer? a scope? How many bullets can the clip have?

I used the nuclear bomb argument because you can of used [it yourself](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1tgamk/as_an_american_im_curious_as_to_what_other_french/ce88h3m), but it was just to say that you need to define what can be used as self defense, and if you add a profile check and other question it makes the ""**Who** have the right to have **what**"" question a big big thing.

&gt;""Sure"" ? No. Are you sure that they can't ? You can't make such a big statement in advance

I'm not sure either, that's why I was asking, not making a statement.

Exactly we know nothing about the future. What if we have a law *port d'armes pour tous*, what can you do if people decide to create armed militia and attack other people? Should we all fight each other with our guns?  Should we let the police handle the situation? Then why not let the police handle the situation right now ? 


You said in one of your message that crime has many variables in place, and I think everybody agree with that BUT they also think (and I do too) that adding armed civilian to the mix is just adding an another variable and not solving the problem. 
I mean do you think it will make the violence stop? Don't you think we can change other things before? (like I said before: police/education/immigration and so on)

Wenn du hier schon hochtrabend rumsülzen willst, dann unterscheiden wir doch erst mal fein zwischen gewählter Legislative und Judikative und Exekutive. 

Die Polizei / Executive hat Gesetze auszuführen und hat zu diesem Zweck das, durch Bürger- und Freiheitsrechte stark eingeschränkte Gewaltmonopol. 

Das erste Problem hier ist die Tatsache, dass Verstöße gegen diese Einschränkungen oft gar nicht geahndet werden (Mobilnetzwerkvollüberwachung), oder auf Grund einer Kombination von Vermummung der Polizei-Beamten vor Ort und nicht-Kennzeichnung der Personen ein de-facto rechtsfreier Raum entsteht.

Ein zweites Problem ist die ""Law and Order""-Mentalität. Scheiß auf die Verletzten auf beiden Seiten, wir müssen uns profilieren.

1)We do not yet know all the facts in this case

 2)The US does not have jurisdiction in Austria just the business operations Austrian companies run in the U.S. (if the court was implying further jurisdiction there is no way they could possible enforce it)

3) If this case makes it way to the Supreme Court and is as ridiculous as it sounds then it will most likely be thrown out 

4)Circuit courts of appeal neither make law nor run foreign policy, and while they may effect how law is practiced, they have, by no means, the final say

5)This is the decision of only one district court (remember the first court said it had no jurisdiction) and a district court that is notoriously left of the the country as a whole. Thus, this decision is a poor representation of both the average American's ideology, as well the jurisprudence of the rest of the country

6) Most importantly, the U.S. is a massive county with 315 million individuals. While generalizations can be helpful to discuss and understand cultural differences, the ones I have read on this thread are juvenile and unhelpful. There is a large population of the United States that believe these sort of lawsuits are insane. That said, no verdict has been reached, if one results in favor of the plaintiff there is an appeal.  Let's hold back on the hate, ask questions questions about the U.S. court system (from the looks of it many people here have no idea what they're talking about) and wait to see how this case develops.

Sweden has 9.5 Million people and a total rape count of 5960. Russia has 140 Million people and a total count of 4907. When you beat the Russian Federation in crime statistics I think you have a big problem.

And this is Sweden's problem. Even in this thread there is a Swedish guy complaining that Sweden is bad at ""integrating"" immigrants. He is acting like a typical Swede: that it is SWEDEN'S fault that the immigrants are behaving this way. NO! When is Sweden going to wake up and see that Islamic immigration to that country is why they have a problem. Do you see the U.S.A having huge issues with Mexican immigration? Do you see the U.S population jumping head over heels to help immigrants ""integrate"" ? The answer is no.

Sweden needs to realize that the very fabric of who they are letting into their country is the problem - not some failure of the Swedish state to ""integrate"" immigrants.

Je n'ai pas prétendu que tu fais l'apologie du criminel. Je suis juste attéré par le fait que tu sembles prétendre que puisque les crimes sont commis par des personnes qu'on connaît, il n'est pas légitime de tenter de s'en défendre.

&gt;Oui, nous avons statistiquement peu d'homicides.

""S'armer jusqu'aux dents"" ça ne veut rien dire. Soit on est armé soit on ne l'est pas.

Explique moi [ce graphique](http://i.imgur.com/eTApLmL.jpg). (les sources des chiffres sont en bas à gauche)
Que les US aient à la fois un taux de crime plus élevé et plus d'armes ne veut pas dire que l'un et l'autre sont liés. Le taux de criminalité dépend d'innombrables facteurs. [Dans le monde tu ne peux trouver aucune corrélation armes &lt;=&gt; crime plus élevé](http://i.imgur.com/d1O7ddC.png).

&gt;Porter une arme, c'est considérer son usage comme règlement valide du conflit [...]

Non. **Tu confonds justice et légitime défense**, comme beaucoup de gens. Je n'ai jamais dit que les armes étaient un outil de justice. Je n'ai jamais dit que les individus devaient se faire justice eux même en tuant n'importe qui avec qui ils ont un conflit.
La légitime défense c'est très différent, ne confonds pas. **La légitime défense c'est tenter de se défendre pour empêcher une agression. Rien à voir avec la résolution à posteriori du conflit, que tu peux confier à l'Etat**. La légitime défense armée ne vient pas remettre en cause la nécessité d'une institution tierce qui vient juger des conflits.

I'm not a fan of discerning that things are wrong on such 'prima facie' grounds. 

What the position I outlined in previous comments is part of a much larger view of human nature. It's somewhere in between 'soft' and 'hard determinism'. Whereby the notion of human freewill is quite intensely questioned.

Your body is something intensely personal as are certain parts of your emotions. You have a right to a private life just as you have a right not to have your body violated just as you have a right to eat, to a family, to clean water, and all the other things laid down in the EU and UN declarations on human rights.

true,skrylius,LITH,Lithuania,"I see. Sounds interesting, I should definitely read about the 1920s more, I feel like my knowledge of that decade is lacking compared to most other eras. 

Anyway, if we talk about reasons why Lithuania declined, I think it's safe to say that one of the reasons were that Lithuanians never were actually satisfied with how Commonwealth turned out, besides the obvious agressive Polish claims on Vilnius. The ideals of equality, if there were any, were forgotten and crushed, Lithuanian nobility polonised, the only ones who felt no shame speaking Lithuanian were those in Prussia and Samogitia, and the first ones were soon assimilated into Germans, while Samogitians were regarded as savages for way longer than they deserved. If at first the state seemed a success, especially under Bathory's rule, but eventually it screwed up.

Finally, the Commonwealth fell to Russia, and I believe that Russian threat was one of the main reasons why the state came to be in the first place, with all the fuss in Livonia and so on, as Lithuania was pretty much landlocked while Russia expanded into the resource-rich Siberia and using the momentum in its western front. 

Besides, I think the fact that the Commonwealth was partitioned was a crucial point in the history of its nations and ethnic groups - had they been annexed by only one of the three partitioners, I believe some sort of national unity would've been preserved. 

However, lets say Commonwealth was rebuilt and lasted until 1940s. What then? Probably something like Yugoslavia, but in the north. Four different nations, many ethnic groups, at least three or four widely spread religions. We can see the result of Yugoslavia today - war crimes, most of the region isn't even in EU. All in all, I'd say it's better to have separate countries and some old grudges that take time to heal rather than murder each other for a decade and still not be in EU by now.

The EFTA countries are third parties, because the EFTA isn't an EU organ. Where are you getting this otherwise?

&gt; EU

If it leaves.

&gt; There'd be a veto if it were a state negotiating AA status from outside. Unitary competence is not applicable under Lisbon in this regard to the UK. It's QMV...or it will be.

Huh? This is some weird legalese that will really not stand. An AA treaty needs unanimity, but you propose that the UK can get an AA from *within* the EU (which has never been done because you only sign AA with external states), and have it apply to the UK after it leaves?

What? Even if it was up to QMV, the only country voting for it would be the UK, because this is such a brazen attempt to skirt around the rules that the 27 members will vote against you.

Moreover, again, I'm not sure you understand what the AA means. It's just a general agreement between the EU and an external country, but that can mean anything. Usually it means extensive social and economic reforms, which I'm assuming you don't want?

I can guarantee that anything the EU negotiates with UK will not include freedom of movement of goods, services and capital *without* freedom of movement of labour. You'd get the Swiss deal (bilateral treaties), become an EFTA member and join the EEA (nothing changes, except you no longer can affect legislation) or join the EFTA without joining the EEA (you have a free trade agreement with 4 other countries).

If your plan relies on 55% of the countries with 65% of the population (which is QMV) voting with the UK to give them even more special treatment before they *leave*, you might want to look at the attitude people have towards the UK in the Continent these days.

Yes. Look up the concealed carry laws in the US, there's pretty much what I would advocate for.

&gt;I used the nuclear bomb argument because you can of used it yourself

I used to prove a point, to explain the principle : ""by raising dramatically the cost of a potential agression, you make that agression much less likely to happen"", I didn't advocate civilian gun ownership...

&gt;it was just to say that you need to define what can be used as self defense

Yes.

&gt;if you add a profile check and other question it makes the ""Who have the right to have what"" question a big big thing.

It should be simple. As long as :
- You're over 18
- You have a clean record (no violent past)
- You're mentally healthy
- You have had training
You should be allowed to own firearms and carry concealed handguns in public.

&gt;I'm not sure either, that's why I was asking, not making a statement.

It should be up to the individuals to decide what best suits them.

&gt;port d'armes pour tous

I never advocated such a thing.

&gt;what can you do if people decide to create armed militia and attack other people?

That's a complete fantasy, it's just not grounded in reality at all. Look at the US and tell me if you see such militias. I don't think we should base public policy of fantasies of crazy martians invading earth.

&gt;dding armed civilian to the mix is just adding an another variable and not solving the problem

You cannot ""solve"" crime. But you can make it less likely to happen, and you can make victims more able to defend themselves.

&gt;I mean do you think it will make the violence stop?

No I don't. Nothing can make it ""stop"". But I do think that if law-abiding citizens have the possibility to arm themselves for defense, it will make criminals much more reluctant to assault, since the cost of that agression is way too high. And for those who do get assaulted, firearms make them much more likely to be able to successfully defend themselves.

&gt;Don't you think we can change other things before? (like I said before: police/education/immigration and so on)

Those solutions very costly, very long to put in place, and we don't even know if they'll have good results. In one word, they're utopian. Civilian ownership of firearms, on the other hand, is a public policy that's quite easy to put in place for a minimal cost, and very efficient. In no time you would see the crime rate go down.

&gt;But do you really think that if we allow guns in the street bad guys will just say ""oh he has a gun, well I think my career in crime is over""

Most of street thugs will, yes. They're humans like us, they care about their lives. They make cost-benefit calculations. If you make assault very very risky and costly, they will stop and try to find another occupation. Or they'll continue their crime activities, but ones that don't involve contact with people.

&gt; or will he think ""damn this guy has a pistol, I better have something bigger to protect my back ?

Once again, that's fantasy, not grounded in reality. Even if you have a gun, attacking an armed victim is very, very, very dangerous. Think about it : any law-abiding citizen can be armed. Even if the thug magically manages to prevent the victim from using his gun, there can very well be another citizen nearby that can put an end to his endeavour.",0,1387817664,null,0,false,0,ce8jr8w,t3_1tgamk,t1_ce8jr8w,t1_ce8i3p9,null,1428015148,0,false,france,t5_2qhjz,0

This is often a problem when the conductor is standing at his last open door and can't let late passengers on the train because at that point he gave the message to the train driver that he can move his train, which he will do from the moment the signal opens. Regularly some passengers will try to get on the train anyway even if it's very dangerous to do so, and some have lost their legs in the past because of that.

As you say, the rules in Netherlands are such that all doors have to be closed before the train can move, which is the signal for the train driver to start moving.

&gt;This is a myth. All licensed dealers, including in gun fairs, have to use the same tools of NCIS backgroung checks.

The thing is : **you don't need a federal gun license** to sell at gun shows. In many states, it's completely legal for a private seller -- you or me -- to sell a gun to someone without running a background check. Garen Wintemute, who heads the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis, explains: ""No identification. No waiting period. No record. Cash on the table, and you're gone with the gun.""

That kind of transaction does happen at gun shows, but it also happens outside them. It is easy to find buyers and sellers online, for instance.

What is so terrible about giving prisoners a vote? It does nothing in terms of rehabilitation, and it is considered to be a 'punishment' despite it being in no way linked to the actual crime committed. There's so little logical basis for not allowing them the vote, and I find it ridiculous that it has become such a contentious issue. It's as if the government is going out of its way to avoid ECHR obligations.

As a side note the only obligation is to give *some* prisoners the vote. The ECHR has no problem with the disenfranchisement of prisoners in general, it merely found that the reasons given by the UK government for the blanket disenfranchisement were not logical. 

Would it really be so abhorrent to give people in prison the right to vote if they were due for release within the election cycle for example, or if their sentence was less than twelve months?

Personnellement je soutiens à 100% la décision du Conseil d'Etat. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi une mère accompagnatrice devrait être soumise aux mêmes contraintes d'un enseignant quant à la tenue ! On refuserait la possibilité à une mère d'aider et d'encadrer le scolaire parce que sa tenue, qui signifie son appartenance religieuse, sortirait du cadre républicain ? Plus cela va et plus j'ai l'impression de vivre dans une dictature de la laïcité - ce qui n'est aucunement une solution à des problèmes d'intégration qui sont le fruit de 40 ans de non-gestion. Est-ce que ce ne serait pas continuer à ostraciser une couche de la population qui a le plus besoin d'intégration ? 

Pour peut-être contextualiser, je suis issu de la bourgeoisie parisienne, catholique pratiquante et impliquée dans son siècle. Donc le voile ne me touche pas directement, mais la chasse à la religion, si. Et ce même si j'ai pris des distances avec la foi de mes parents. J'ai par ailleurs vécu en Asie, et à mon retour je crois que mon regard sur le port d'insignes religieux avait évolué. J'ai pu prendre du recul sur les conflits sociaux actuels en France.

Un article du Monde Diplomatique de février 2013 s'applique, je pense, à ce sujet : [Pour une analyse profane des conflits](http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2013/02/CORM/48760). Ce sont les conflits ""à grande échelle"" qui sont abordés, mais je pense que cela s'applique aussi aux conflits sociaux rencontrés aujourd'hui par de nombreux pays de l'Union Européenne.

PS : les commentaires de l'article sont assez édifiants :

&gt; Donc les catho tradis bloquent la rue de notre parlement, les musulmans tradis se baladent en voile dans les sorties scolaires...bien bien bien...on leur fait bouffer quand leur calote ?

Qui peut me dire que l'athé engagé est ouvert et respectueux ?

&gt; C'est une erreur grave. Les sorties d'école sont sans doute l'un des rares lieux où ces femmes sont libres de se rendre seules. On vient donc de rater une chance unique de combattre cette pratique moyenâgeuse.

Pensée naïve (si on leur interdit de venir avec leur voile elles viendront toutes sans), illusoire (les femmes voilées ne sont pas chaperonnées) et anachronique (islam + moyen-âge = ensemble presque vide, les françaises étaient souvent voilées jusque dans les années 50)

&gt; Pourquoi la photo en une du monde.fr présente-t-elle plusieurs femmes portant le niqab, un vêtement qui n'a aucun rapport avec le voile dont il est ici question mais une image qui, associée comme elle l'est ici à cette dépêche, pourrait être source de confusions, de peurs et de rejet. Attention aux petites désinformations pernicieuses, surtout quand elles ne flattent pas les aspects les plus nobles de l'être humain.

C'est un point que j'avais relevé ici-même il y a quelques mois, et qui me sidère encore régulièrement.

You really don't get it do you? 

Unless you're the most powerful guy out there, you need rules to protect you from being stomped on. Are you the richest? The strongest? No, you're just some guy. And you're the beneficiary of the rules and regulations we've gradually set up to *protect* people like you and me from being exploited and generally fucked over by people more powerful than ourselves.

You seem to think that governments are the bad guys here, don't you? You think that exploitation comes from political leaders, don't you?

Well, at least we've got a say in what our politicians do. (That, by the way, is the point of the whole ""democracy"" thing. That's why democracy is better than a dictatorship, for example, where you get no say at all.)

But do you think you're safe when BigCorp™ decides they want to eat all of their competitors, creating a monopoly? Do you think you're safe with SecuriCorp™ decides to start running a protection racket (it'd be a such shame to mess up your pretty face if you couldn't pay, wouldn't it?)

The fact is that anyone amassing large amounts of power is dangerous. Doesn't matter if they're a gov't or a corporation, or a church for that matter. That's why we've got a system of laws in place - because it's the only thing stopping you from being crushed, smart guy.

Here's an alternate idea, that you may find boring, but actually works (unlike libertarianism): Make our democracies *work better*. That means exposing anyone with power to the light of transparency, and accountability. That means ensuring that corporations (or whatever large organisation) is *unable* to hurt you, by law.

So stop arguing with me, and have a think about the dangers of large organisations screwing you over. Have a think about how under Libertarianism, theres *nothing* to stop them from doing so. Have a think about why *democracy* is better than dictatorship. Have a think about how *accountability* (the core concept in democracy) means that you're safer from government than if the accountability didn't exist.

Then have a think about why ""freedom"" is such a stupid idea when you take it too far. Of course no one wants to live under the oppression of gov't (like North Korea). But think about how ""freedom"" doesn't just apply to you, how it also applies to bad people who are stronger than you.

What do people say exactly? Here Southerners say that they are the hardworkers because they live in rural areas unlike Northerners who work in the city where you just go sit at a desk. I've actually had this conversation on reddit discussing whether people that live in the city were lazy. The person that I was arguing with was adamant that working in the city makes you lazy. But again, it's not just a north versus south thing but a city versus rural thing. There's always talk from them about how city folk/northerners take more welfare as well (which is blatantly false) and they associate people on welfare as lazy or they will say that they are irresponsible and just waste money without paying for it (they were saying this about California when they had a big deficit).

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"The way he says it and the way he frames gun rights issues is a very peculiar one, even unique. I can tell with certainty that he is massively inspired by this aspect of American politics and tries to sort of reproduce it in France. His initiative is better understood as a strictly individual project, which may or may not be supported by the small kernel of French Classic Liberals/Libertarians active on the Internet, huddled around the websites Contrepoints.org and Liberaux.org. I can't emphasize enough how idiosyncratic this initiative really is, as even among libertarian-leaning French people, gun rights is a very low priority issue.

However and even though this is indeed a unique perspective, there is no ""French Ethos"" that every Frenchman adheres to. I can assure you that a substantial part of the French population believes in vigilante justice and things such as bringing back the death penalty. It's very likely that many of these people would be okay with an easier access to firearms, but they don't really demand it and it isn't out of distrust of the government at all.

A prime thing to understand is that if you are a defendant who contests the legitimacy of a US court's exercise of geographical jurisdiction, you need to raise that objection at the beginning, or it may be waived.  (This is not usually combined with anything else, because you don't agree that the court has the power to decide anything else.) .  That is what OBB did, and what this appeal was about.  If this ruling stands,   OBB will now have the opportunity to file for what is called ""summary judgment,"" meaning ""this crazed loon couldn't win this claim even if the jury was composed of household appliances, so let us out of this case.""        

And I hate to disagree with so many passionate voices, but this ruling, limited to the jurisdiction question, is not that shocking.  American courts operate on, among other things, the idea that if you come into a state/the country to do business, you subject yourself to liability for the way you conduct that business.  A Slovakian corporation that sells a defective product in the US, even through an intermediary, can't evade liability for the defective product just because they ""stay"" in Slovakia.  

Generally, this is a good thing, intended to promote responsible behavior and consumer protection.  Here, OBB sold tickets to US consumers through its agent, RailPass.  It would suck to say, hey, we came to your country (through our intermediary) and sold you this product, but don't expect us to abide by your country's consumer laws.  There is a lot of Imperial over-reach in American law but this isn't the best example.

Their crime rate would be much higher if it was not for civilian gun ownership. [Please explain this to me](http://i.imgur.com/eTApLmL.jpg) (all the sources are on the lower left corner).

&gt;Owning a tool who's sole purpose is to hurt someone is hardly non-violent.

That's just not true. What do you make of hunting and sport shooting ? Hell, soon [you'll even be able to plant seeds with a shotgun](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-12/20/flower-shell-indiegogo).
Even when they're used for self-defense, guns are not always used to kill. **In the US, 80 to 98% of defensive gun use don't involve a single shot being fired**.
And even if that were true, even if ""firearms' sole purpose is to hurt someone"". How is that a bad thing ? The use of force for self-defense is legitimate.

&gt;The very fact that you own a gun means your family and other people, including you, are more likely to die by gunfire.

The very fact that you own a car means your family and other people, including you, are more likely to die by a car accident.
But you don't want to ban cars, do you ?

""But no, cars have a legitimate purpose, that is taking you from one place to another""
So do firearms. Beyond hunting and sport shooting, they can be used in self-defense. And defensive gun uses in the US are 4 times more prevalent than offensive uses of guns.

&gt;They will make equally dead when a robber shoots you down because he had to get a gun to defend himself from an armed populace.

So a robber ""defends himself"" ? He's the poor little guy being attacked by the armed populace ? Gosh, be careful with what you write.
But beyond that, once again, that's not grounded in reality. In reality, facing an armed victim is very, very, very dangerous, even if you yourself own a gun. And think about it : any law-abiding citizen is potentially armed. That means that any armed bystander can come to the rescue and stop you in your criminal endeavour.

&gt; je suis globalement opposé au voile. En particulier à son association avec la religion. A mon avis, c'est un artefact culturel et non religieux.

Oui... et non. Je ne pense pas que tu puisses distinguer le rôle social du rôle religieux du voile.

Oui parce que je connais une musulmane banlieusarde qui a toujours été fervente, mais ne porte pas le voile, et est mal vue à ce titre. Il faut distinguer multiples pratiques de l'islam, où le port du voile varie : de cheveux nus à foulard de paysanne à la hijab au niqab. Il ont chacun leur histoire, leur contexte. Et les wahabistes qui prétendent leur lecture la seule bonne et éternelle sont des menteurs.

Non parce qu'être contre le voile ne fait pas sens : le voile est un symptome, et il faut être soit mauvais médecin soit que la maladie soit incurable pour vouloir effacer le symptome.

Non parce que le religieux participe du social, surtout dans le cas de l'islam aujourd'hui en France. Je suis, dans ce sens, également pour une lecture du voile comme un symbole social (ce qui fait de mon non en partie un oui). Si les musulmanes voilées se couvraient les cheveux comme de nombreuses femmes en France il y a 50 ans et plus cela ne poserait pas de problème : c'est le clash culturel qui fait mal.

Vietnam isn't stupid. They're leveraging us against the Chinese threat, like they leveraged the Soviets and Chinese against the American threat back in the day. You don't need a degree in International Relations to recognize this.

&gt;With China and one another, it's just how they roll in East Asia.

Yes, and my country is obligated to defend Japan and The Philippines, both of which have some sort of territorial dispute with China. We are obligated to defend South Korea as well, although South Korean-Chinese relations are actually pretty well-off, but the recent Chinese AIDZ also infringes on South Korean claims. 

&gt;Not necessarily connected with China. Increase in military spending may follow lobbying by local or foreign military industrial complex just as well.

It's absolutely connected with China. You have to be literally blind and willfully ignorant to not see the connection between Japan's territorial disputes with China and their increased military funding, with them specifically focusing on power projection and the ability to land troops amphibiously with adequate fire support.

&gt;You need to prove that it is indeed dominant view among the Chinese.

I never said it was a dominant view, but I did say it has been advocated by leading military Generals &amp; Professors *(the seizure of contested territory that is)*. Although the idea of a limited war in general *is dominant* among the Chinese military and government, so as to avoid nuclear escalation.  

&gt;US have military facilities all around the world, condemning third country for trying to achieve a small fraction of this presence reeks of hypocrisy.

It's not hypocrisy. It's competition. War and geo-politics in general are not fair. Only a fool would think that. Not wanting China to upsurp American influence and not wanting them to develop the logistical network for power projection isn't hypocrisy, it's simply looking out for my country's interests and hegemony. 

I have no intention of denying that or hiding that. If there ever is a war, the best war is a quick war, and the best war for me particularly is a won war. China's move to become the dominant force in the Asian region and to surpass the United States endangers this. 

&gt;Yet there is more coercion in this than in any of Chinese moves you mentioned. Inability of latest Japanese PM to kick American military base out of Okinawa despite overwhelming support of Japanese population demonstrates it well.

&gt;None of cues you mentioned demonstrates hostile intentions of China. What they do demonstrate is intention to over-state threat from third countries like China to justify unrestricted use of power by the US.

You know, it's kinda weird that the *newly elected* Japanese PM reversed that decision right when territorial disputes with China began to heat up. And it's a little weird that he increased military spending around the same time. But you know....I guess those arn't at all related in your opinion... ;) 

And coercion doesn't equal subjection. And China has damn a damn shit load of it's own coercion in setting up military facilities, and don't think for a second they haven't. Oh and we were leaving Okinawa by the way, it was the Japanese government that reversed it's decision. The Philippines asked us to leave Subic Bay in the 1980s, and we did. But than *their government* invited us back when it started having territorial disputes with China. China has done more for American power projection and military infrastructure in the region than American diplomacy *ever could*. ;) 

And you underestimate and disrespect China by thinking they're just some puny little country. They're not. China is going to be a great power, at the same level of the United States, one day. This new century has been dubbed the *""Asian Century""*. The United States recognizes this, hence why we're re-positiong 60% of both our Air Force and Navy in the region, and moving away from our Cold War-era Europe strategy *(The United States military budget for Europe has already been cut by 1/5th, or 20%)*. 

This isn't about morality. This isn't about how *""unfair""* the United States is being by opposing Chinese military expansion. Unfair doesn't exist. Neither China nor the United States are some kind of moral linchpin. They are competitors, both with huge influence, and both of which will do huge amounts to shape the world in coming years.

Get off your high horse. There is no boogeyman. There is no *""right""*. There are only many sides in a multi-polar world, and depending on where you're a citizen, one of those sides is going to benefit you more. In my case, as in the case of South Korea, Japan and the Philippines, that side is America. 

Don't deny the obvious, don't deny the competition, don't deny the geopolitical relations between actors in the region, it's disrespectful to not only the countries involved, but history in general. Be honest with yourself and others, don't try to replace reality with your own version of it or attempt to be some moral arbiter of justification, because it won't work.

Oh that's funny coming from an anti-gun who usually tie the higher crime rate of the US to its high gun ownership.

But anyway, that's not what I was saying. I just put this in order to say : if the anti-gun claim *""more guns mean more crime""* is true, then [this](http://i.imgur.com/eTApLmL.jpg) is very difficult to explain.

&gt;But then I wouldn't expect a gun nut to be smart.

1 - I'm no ""gun nut"". I don't own any firearms, I don't have any fascination for firearms, I don't plan on buying any, I touched a rifle once a few years ago.
2 - Please have some respect. I never insulted you. We're trying to have a rational debate here, throwing an insult doesn't help.

&gt;A car's sole purpose isn't to hurt someone else.

Neither is a firearms'. Gosh, did you actually read my comment ? I'm gonna copy-paste :
""What do you make of hunting and sport shooting ? Hell, [soon you'll even be able to plant seeds with a shotgun](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-12/20/flower-shell-indiegogo). Even when they're used for self-defense, guns are not always used to kill. **In the US, 80 to 98% of defensive gun use don't involve a single shot being fired**. 
And even if that were true, even if ""firearms' sole purpose is to hurt someone"". How is that a bad thing ? The use of force for self-defense is legitimate.""

&gt;I'm literally not preventing you from doing so. 

Good.

&gt;Get the necessary permits and own your very own rifle

That's one thing I want to have changed. Why should you have to be a sport shooter or a hunter in order to be able to buy a firearm ? Self-defense is a legitimate reason to own a firearm. Any law-abiding citizen should be able to buy one as long as you have a clean record, have had the proper training, and as long as you're mentally healthy.

&gt;it's your own business.

Great. That, I really appreciate, it's quite unusual for an anti-gun, who by and large want to ban firearms completely.

&gt;We're also not dumb enough to believe that throwing guns at a problem will magically reduce violence.

There's no magic here, it's just human nature : people care about their life, criminals also do. If they fear they might get killed by assaulting somebody, their cost-benefit analysis will greatly change and either they'll find a job or they'll enter crime areas that don't involve encounter with a person.
And it's not about ""throwing guns at a problem"". It's about enabling those law-abiding citizens who wish so to have and be able to carry a firearm for their legitimate self-defense.",0,1387829837,null,0,false,0,ce8otta,t3_1tgamk,t1_ce8otta,t1_ce8oc24,null,1428012676,-1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,-1

You don't have to, you can buy some firearms over the counter.

&gt;Great. That, I really appreciate, it's quite unusual for an anti-gun, who by and large want to ban firearms completely.

Yep, I believe that we're better off living without firearms. However I recognize that firearms aren't a huge deal, that current limitations are good enough and don't need to be tightened all that much. Or even loosened.

They will get a gun and shoot first.

You can already if you want to. Just get the necessary permits. I don't know why you keep whining about how you're not able to carry a firearm when you can actually carry a firearm.

You still haven't answered this : even if that were true, **even if ""firearms' sole purpose is to hurt someone"". How is that a bad thing in itself ? The use of force for self-defense is legitimate.""**

No. I'm just saying that your claim *""firearms only hurt""* is not true.

I'm saying I want to have those change, I didn't say that I would necessarly manage to do that. But I'm working for it, that's why I'm writing a book.

&gt;I believe that we're better off living without firearms

A world where the physically stronger, younger and those who are more numerous can rule over the rest of us. Awesome.

&gt;They will get a gun and shoot first.

That's just not true outside of anti-gun fantasies. Look at the US, is that what happens there ? No it's not. If I remember well, only 20% of all violent crime involves a firearm.

&gt; Just get the necessary permits.

Those permits are for sport shooter of hunters. I'm neither. I want to be able to get a gun for self-defense : it should be recognized as a legitimate purpose.

&gt;I don't know why you keep whining about how you're not able to carry a firearm when you can actually carry a firearm.

That's just completely false. You cannot carry a firearm in public places unless it's from your home to the shooting range, and then they have to be dismantled. Look up the concealed-carry laws in the US, that's what I'm advocating for.

&gt;Rate of gun homicide per 100,000 People, USA vs France

Who cares about ""gun homicide"" ? I care about homicide per se. The tool that was used is irrelevant. We're not talking about ""knife homicide"" or whatever.

Yes, the crime rate in the US is higher than in France. But as you rightly said yourself : *""rying to tie lower crime rates to just one factor like gun ownership is absolute intellectual dishonesty""*

But the settlements make it very attractive to sue someone in the US, if that someone has deep pocket (large company, state, or good insurance) and you have a good chance of winning. Most cases get thrown out, because they don't have a connection to the US. But since it is common law, the judges do have a lot of leeway, if there is no precedence. And then there are always upper courts.

Not everything that is different is crap. Different strokes for different folks. If you ever go to the US, you get a feeling for the people and why they have the system their way.

In June 2012, following final dismissal by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom of his appeal against enforcement of the European Arrest Warrant, Assange has failed to surrender to his bail, and has been treated by the UK authorities as having absconded.

My calculation: 700 rent, 300 food, 20 gym, 30 cheap phone plan, 450 transport, insurance, others), that's still a decent 500 of savings a month.

Perhaps my rent figure was a little conservative and the place won't be super glamorous but this would be 500-ish after extra charges (http://www.immobilienscout24.de/expose/72616425) or this at 650 (http://www.immobilienscout24.de/expose/72536530) or 650 also (http://www.immobilienscout24.de/expose/72522156) unless there is something odd about these places or I am missing something?

Functionally, very littel seperates them. Loading and firing either weapon (and nearly any semi or fully automatic weapon) is nearly identical.

true,clbrink,null,null,"Recently made a permanent move to Germany from the US, maybe I can help.  First, if you are using US dollars to pay for things, you always have to account for the exchange rate.  While I live in a medium size city in Bavaria, in my opinion rents are not that bad when compared to US prices. 500-700 euro a month will land you a decent ein-zimmer (studio) or zwei-zimmer (1 bedroom) flat. I know you mentioned Munich, this is the most expensive city in Germany for rents. 

But there are a few things to consider when getting an apartment. Things can vary of course, but they generally come with nothing inside. By nothing I mean, no kitchen (no counters cupboards, stove), light fixtures, closets, window blinds, washer-dryer, or any furniture of any kind. As in the US, most these things usually come standard. So you will have some initial outlay in these costs to account for.  

For utilities you will have to consider what the kaltmiete (no utilities) and what the warmmiete (with utilities) are.  The warmmiete can vary on what is included but its usually heating and water.  These are adjusted yearly.  
I can""t speak for how much electricity varies per month in different places but for me its around 40-50 euro a month.  TV and internet packages in my opinion, are a bit cheaper than in the US. Basic TV is always available as there is a monthly tax for this.  But providers like Kabel Deutschland are about half the cost of what I was used to in the US.

Food is rather affordable too.  Germany is pretty strict on how groceries are priced and stores operate on the most narrow margins in Europe.  Eating out can get expensive though.  Most Germans tend to eat at home as this is much cheaper and fast food is not as readily available.     

Most goods such as electronics, clothing, furniture, etc. are usually the same price as you would find in the US, but priced in euros.  So, if you are paying with converted US dollars your looking at a 37% price increase at today's rates. If you have euros, than its not so bad.  

Owning a car and filling the car with gas is extremely expensive.  First, quickly converted, gas is about $7.75 a gallon.  Germany is very strict with the road-worthiness of cars, so you can""t be driving a clunker nor will you see one.  Also, there is yearly tax on owning a car and repairs don't come cheap either.  

I would check out a Wohngenossenschaft (housing association of sorts) over a private person for rents.  They are more likely to rent to foreigners and students.  But be warned, it will be tough to find a place as a foreigner and a doubly as a student.  A wohngenossenschaft is more likely to rent to a foreigner than a private owner.   I was in lucky because my fiance is German and she was able to handle all of this. 

I don't want to ramble but I hope that gives you some direction.  Germany is an excellent country to live in. Very beautiful, safe, tons of history and amazing beer. Viel Glück!

Je ne prétendrai pas que la religion n'a jamais été utile, ni qu'elle est inconciliable avec la science, juste que dans le monde d'aujourd'hui la religion n'a plus d'utilité à mes yeux. 

La religion avait pour moi deux buts principaux à savoir inculquer une morale de ce qui est socialement acceptable ou non à des populations qui étaient éloignées voire nomades afin d'avoir un minimum de repères communs. Une sorte de niveleur social en quelques sortes.

Elle avait aussi pour but d'expliquer l’inexplicable à une époque où la science n'était pas suffisamment avancée pour expliquer des choses telles que la naissance de l'univers ou l'apparition de l'homme car l'humain est ainsi fait qu'il ne peut pas se contenter de ne pas savoir.

Les repères moraux aujourd'hui, beaucoup nous ont été légués par la religion et c'est plutôt une bonne chose mais à part certains marginaux tout le monde est globalement d'accord que tuer son voisin, baiser la femme du voisin quand il est boulot ou voler ce qui ne t'appartient pas est mal. 

Pour ce qui est des explications des mystères de l'univers, la science fait des progrès chaque jours et à chaque fois cela ne correspond pas à ce que prétendent les différents livres saints donc je pense que le fait que ce qui est écrit dedans au niveau des explications sur la vie et la terre est globalement plutôt faux (et donc forcément pas divin) paraît suffisamment évident pour admettre que ce sont des fabrications de toutes pièces pour expliquer ce qui était à l'époque inexplicable.

Zuerst wurde er willkomen geheißen, dann wurden ihm menschliche Züge verliehen, als auch über seine Familie berichtet wurde. Dann sorgte man sich um sein Vermögen, denn er war plötzlich so etwas wie ein Freiheitskämpfer - unser Freiheitskämpfer.

Dann wurden Artikel geschrieben, die die deutsche Politik in ein äußerst positives Licht rückten (""Triumph der deutschen Geheimdiplomatie""). Immer wieder wurde betont, der greise Genscher hätte alles eingefädelt, seine diplomatischen Kontakte spielen lassen und seit Monaten schwer um die Freilassung eben dieses einen Verbrechers gekämpft. Von dieser Geschichte profitierten also vor allem das durch die NSA-Affäre angeschlagene Image der deutschen Diplomatie, wie auch Genscher und somit seine Partei FDP, deren Politiker es eben doch noch können, Dinge wahr werden zu lassen. 

Ebenso wurde Deutschland als ganz wundervolles Land angepriesen (Titel: ""Schöne, freie, wilde Welt""). Deutschland als ein Land, das verfolgten Regimekritikern eine Zuflucht ist und sich um deren Existenz sorgt; Deutschland als die letzte Bastion der Demokratie vor dem wilden Osten.

Wenn man das alles im tatsächlichen Ablauf betrachtet und in einen Zusammenhang setzt, kann man den Eindruck gewinnen, hier wurde ein Weihnachtsmärchen erzählt, um die doch sehr geschundene deutsche Seele zum Jahresausklang wieder zu beruhigen: 

Wir nehmen eben doch Regimekritiker auf (Snowden-Debakel). Wir kümmern uns um Flüchtlinge (Lampedusa-Debakel). Deutsche Politiker können auch auf Weltmächte Einfluss ausüben (NSA-Debakel).

Um das gleich vorwegzunehmen: Ich denke nicht, dass das zentral gesteuert war. Vielmehr glaube ich an die Magie der Weihnachtszeit, der auch Journalisten unterliegen. Eine Zeit, in der der Wunsch nach gelebter Nächstenliebe, Besinnlichkeit und Frieden das Handeln bestimmt.

Die Journalisten hätten auch die Geschichte von einem weißen, verloren gegangenen und wiedergefundenen Kaninchen derart hochgejazzt, wenn es sich denn angeboten hätte.

Mit dem Chodorkovsky hat all das fast gar nichts zu tun, und deshalb ist der am 24. Dezember wieder vergessen.

Ils envisagent juste la religion et la science sur deux plans différents et lorsque la religion dit des choses complètement en contradiction avec la science, ils estiment qu'elle parlait à des gens d'une autre époque avec des mots et des notions de leur époque. Là où la science contredit, on voit des paraboles dont on ne doit pas envisager la lettre mais l'esprit. C'est évident que la Bible ne va pas contenir des explications détaillées sur les constantes de l'univers ou la théorie du Big Bang. 

Concernant les progrès scientifiques, à mon avis, ils sont beaucoup plus dangereux pour les institutions et courants politiques que pour les religions. Les religions ne sont absolument pas menacées par plus de technologie, au contraire, plus on augmente nos capacités à influer sur le monde, plus on se retrouve confronté individuellement à des dilemmes auxquels la science ne peut répondre, la mort, l'amour, comment mener une vie épanouissante, c'est quand même plus difficile maintenant avec nos vies très longues et les progrès de la médecine, avec l'indépendance individuelle que permet l'abondance matérielle ou avec notre consommation effrénée de divertissement qu'avant où on ne s'intéressait qu'à la survie au jour le jour. 

Alors que le politique va être complètement laminé par l'accroissement du nombre de ces problèmes sans réponse, l'efficacité d'un certain nombre de progrès ( comme la robotisation et l'automatisation des processus administratifs ) qui lui laisseront beaucoup moins à apporter sur un plan sociétal et la mondialisation qui enlève toute légitimité à une certaine partie des méthodes politiques basées sur des citoyennetés nationales ( par exemple qu'à terme, il n'y a pas d'avantage à avoir défendu une position temporairement gagnante si on ne fait pas varier le résultat final, et que par exemple contrairement à ce que disent les souverainistes type Montebourg ou FN, le protectionnisme est juste le moyen de ne pas avoir d'influence sur le résultat final ).

So you're not saying that more guns = more crimes. Good.

Once again, I must have said this 10 times in this thread : who cares about gun crime per se ? What matters is the crime rate in general, not just gun-crime or knife-crime of whatever.

&gt;This just means that letting people buy more guns won't actually lower the crime rate

No it doesn't. It means that crime is caused by way too many variables to just be able to say ""look, the US is more violent because they have lots of guns"". Worldwide, the correlation just doesn't hold.

&gt;I dunno why you'd go and refute your own point

You still haven't understood my point. I never claimed ""armed countries are safer than disarmed countries"". That would be a very stupid statement to make, since crime involves a whole lot of variables other than just gun.

What I say is : **for any given society**, it will be more peaceful with armed law-abiding citizens than when those same law-abiding citizens are disarmed.

&gt;I mean I'm not sure if lowering the amount of people getting mugged is a good thing if it the solution used increases gun criminality by a similar margin.

With this you have almost full coverage, except anything more than basic dental care. Acupuncture and other nonsense included. But you pay up to €5 for each medication you need.  
Once you earn more than €53,550 (in 2014, this number increases every year by ~1500) you can opt-out and get private health insurance instead. This means you pay cash and get the money back later from the insurance, but your rates may go up (car insurance style).  
Health insurance for students up to 30 years of age (or older if you got your higher education entrance qualification after 24) is around €65 a month.

As a german, you get around 60% of the money you earn cash, after taxes and all insurances (health, long-term care, pension, unemployment benefits) and if you're catholic or protestant you also pay church tax. I have no idea if you actually have to pay for all the insurances, too. The less you earn the bigger the percentage you get, as a student you can earn up to €9000 a year tax free.

Don't forget all extra charges that add to the rent: ""Nebenkosten"" include cold water, waste disposal, almost always cable etc. for somewhat around €30-80/month. Then ""Heizkosten"", heating and warm water, for an additional €50-100.  
Unless stated otherwise you have to pay extra for electricity, €30-50.

300 for groceries alone is a lot, calculate with 200, you may even just need 100. If you eat out you pay 15-20 for a meal with drinks, tip included.  
20 gym is possible, good gyms cost 35-80.  
A monthly ticket in Munich is 45-65.

In apartments the kitchen is usually free. You can buy a kitchen at IKEA starting from 200 plus appliances. Ovens start at 230, 2 burners at 100. So build your own basic kitchen for about 800-1000.

The other big difference in our constitution is that ours has lots of rather crazy anachronisms that have resulted from it having evolved gradually, rather than having been specifically designed. For example, the queen still has the power to refuse to pass legislation. Does this make you uncomfortable? Personally I don't think it makes sense to be uncomfortable about theoretical problems.

true,digitalixus,null,null,"Thanks for going so in-depth with the advice (and congrats on the move!). It certainly did cover a lot of areas I was looking at. I used Munich as an example since I wanted to see just how it would stack up against ""expensive in America"" cities. I'm not picky about location, though I have a preference for larger cities (being a big city person myself, and advice from German friends that I as a non-white foreigner would have a better time than in a small town) and southern Germany (for the weather and most people I know from Germany are from there).

The 'bare' apartments certainly are... weird. I'd have no problems with the concept if I was an EU citizen, but since I'm not, there's that uncertainty factor (having to sell everything if I move?) and the general hassle (Are movers cheap in Germany? I'd imagine relocating, even down the street, with sinks, washing machines and such would be a huge pain). Are 'partial' furnished apartments really as common as the ones I see on Immoscout 24? (counters, washer, stove provided).

From what you mention, everything sounds really reasonable compared to living in America. I want to live in a large city environment, but I can't see myself spending a huge chunk of my monthly income on rent/repayment (west coast US/Canada) for a stupid pigeon hole apartment or basement. If one were to go with the warmmiete option, is this usually a fixed payment to the renter (regardless of usage) or is it just used to give a more accurate estimate of what actual rent is like?

I'm kind of lucky I don't watch TV a lot on a TV, so an internet package is what I'll need (I see it's about 30 euro monthly for a basic plan) and I'm trying to cut costs/lose weight, so I'm trying to eat out as infrequently as possible.

How reliant is the German lifestyle on cars? I'm guessing since they make Euros, at EUR1.30+/liter, it isn't too horrible; in Canada, it's about $1.30/liter. Living in Vancouver right now, the public transportation system is really good compared to the US, but it still doesn't work and you'll need a car if you ever A) need to get somewhere on time, B) value time (some places that take 40-50+ minutes to reach by 2 buses would only be 10-15 minutes in a car) or C) traveling with more than 1 person who doesn't have an unlimited student transit pass (basically having to pay $2.75 minimum + wait a horrid amount of time). To me, that basically means ""almost every active working adult ever who doesn't want to pay $2000 in rent downtown"" needs a car, despite the city's push to become less reliant on cars (this place is far, FAR away from that)

Sounds like solid advice and you're lucky to have had an 'insider' help you with everything.

What I said was that if Greece, and any country for that matter, wishes to develop and have very high standards of living, the rule of law has to be respected.

I think it's really one of the pillars on which any economy,or society for that matter, is constructed.

And to go back to what the guy above said, I don't understand how you can possibly think that a significant amount of citizens in a country are not paying taxes is not a huge violation of the rule of law. Greece has 160% (?) of GDP as debt. Where do you think the government gets it money from?  If 20-30% (I think that's how big I read that Greece's black market is) of government revenue is not collected each year then of course there will be bad consequences. And I'm not referring only to paying back debt, but to healthcare,education,infrastructure,etc... all of the things that are so important for any economy.

Given that Greece will recover at some point in the future,if it ever wishes to be a very well off country it cannot have such a huge black market,and respect for laws have to become a very big priority.

Lorsqu'il parle de la morale issue de Dieu, bonne car définie par la perfection théologique, elle est celle du Dieu métaphysique, dont les détails de l'existence voire l'existence elle-même importe peu. Si tu étudies avec attention la ""preuve ontologique"" de l'existence de Dieu dans la Critique de la raison pure, tu te rendras compte que l'argument ne tient que si l'on parle d'un Dieu métaphysique, qui n'est que le nom que l'on donne à un certains nombre d'hypothèses nécessaires à la pensée de Kant.

Ce qui n'a strictement rien à voir avec le Dieu des religions, encore moins de celles du livres, puisque les secondes peignent le portrait figé d'une divinité avec des attributs arbitraires, et les premières sont un système de mythes qui par définition sont changeants et étrangers au raisonnement kantien.

Quant à Pascal, ce n'est pas un philosophe, mais un théologien. Au contraire, il crache à la gueule des philosophes. C'est pas comme si tu défendais la morale religieuse en citant Thomas d'Aquin, mais presque. Ceci dit ses Pensées sont un chef d'oeuvre de dialectique, et sont par là infiniment loin des enseignements de la religion aux foules.  

Et puis franchement, sortir Tocqueville au milieu de Kant et Pascal... Le rêve de Tocqueville c'est de réconcilier l'homme ""libre"" et l'homme ""de foi"" en séparant très strictement l'Eglise et l'Etat. Pourquoi ? Parce qu'il observe que la religion chez le peuple perd sa dimension transcendante est ne reste qu'un code moral libre d'être interprété par le premier politicien venu. Il remarque même que la religion telle qu'elle est vécue par le peuple le dessert puisqu'elle le laisse démuni face à l'élite pragmatique.

true,herps,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; It doesn't mean we should pump huge amounts of money in our forces. Especially since US already spends so much on war stuff, us spending trillions on it would be redundant. There are better sources to spend our money on.

And herein lies the problem with our transatlantic relationship.  We give you take.  You may have some of the best top notch forces in the world, but if they are small, underfunded and under armed then what good are they when they are called on.  If you can't pull your own weight in a conflict then what is in it for the US?  Why couldn't we take the money spent on NATO and spend it on our armed forces or better yet on our own people.

To clarify I'm not advocating the US give up on NATO, I like NATO and believe its in both our interests to cooperate.  But if European countries are not willing to spend their own money on the defense of their sovereignty and their strategic goals then why do you think the US is going to be willing to do so?  

I don't think were near that tipping point yet, but the trends are definitely moving in the wrong direction.

true,ghostofpennwast,CORS,Corsica,"&gt;Although a person's enlistment in the armed forces of a foreign country may not constitute a violation of U.S. law, it could subject him or her to Section 349(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1481(a)(3)] which provides for loss of U.S. nationality if an American voluntarily and with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship enters or serves in foreign armed forces engaged in hostilities against the United States or serves in the armed forces of any foreign country as a commissioned or non-commissioned officer.

Military service in foreign countries, however, usually does not cause loss of citizenship since an intention to relinquish citizenship normally is lacking.  In adjudicating loss of nationality cases, the Department has established an administrative presumption that a person serving in the armed forces of a foreign state not engaged in hostilities against the United States does not have the intention to  relinquish citizenship.  On the other hand, voluntary service in the armed forces of a state engaged in hostilities against the United States could be viewed as indicative of an intention to relinquish U.S. citizenship.

Pursuant to Section 351(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a person who served in foreign armed forces while under the age of eighteen is not considered subject to the provisions of Section 349(a)(3) if, within six months of attaining the age of eighteen, he or she asserts a claim to United States citizenship in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of State",0,1387855700,null,0,false,0,ce8yzyl,t3_1tjk6e,t1_ce8yzyl,t1_ce8yic1,null,1428007791,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

I'd say it really depends on the city and then where you live and where you need to go. In my hometown we live a bit outside and 2km make the difference if I can just jump into the tram which goes every 5-10min or have to wait 30min-1h for a bus. Then cities like Munich have S-Bahn which actually can get you into the city center pretty fast, in addition it's underground in the city center and so you aren't suck in traffic. In the city there can be different system again, where I study for example it's all buses and they all go to the city center and then straight away from it, which can suck if you imagine a triangle and want to get from A to B, but have to go over C, because there is not straight connection.

For those who are nervous about going such as OP, my advice is simply to not think about it. Here's my experience:


My first night as an exchange student in Japan my family (just the men of course, my homestay father and brother) took me and the American university student also living with them to the onsen. For reference, I'm Canadian and didn't know him - a huge coincidence, which was extremely lucky for me considering how bad my Japanese was/is. He spoke it near-fluently and was very generous about translating.

Anyways, he came along because he knew I'd feel *really* uncomfortable, and he had only been to one once. So, we get there, and then as u/greatestname describes, you put your stuff in a locker and strip down. This was the most difficult part. I of course had never been around a hundred other naked men, and if it weren't for my homestay family bringing me here I probably never would've gone to one. I was *super uncomfortable* at first, until we were sitting in a hot tub. The Japanese carried their small towels on their heads and shoulders - I noticed the American guy and I covering our dicks, but not blatantly. We just let the towel kind of dangle in the way.

After being around other naked men for a while, the reality kind of kicked in, and I was far too relaxed from the heat and humidity to care. There were many hot baths and steam rooms, and hell, as I sit here in my kitchen writing this as it's -2* Celsius, I *really* wish I was at an onsen right now. There was the very traditional Japanese music playing, the roof was completely open (like a traditional/ancient Roman bath) and I could see the stars, and the heat and water was incredibly refreshing and revitalizing. 

We were probably there for a good hour, but after only 10-15 minutes I was socializing with the random Japanese people who were so interested to chat with me (because I'm white) as I sat in a hot tub with them. 

After that short little awkward period, you honestly forget about how you look, and how everybody else looks. None of the Japanese cared that I was naked - why would they? They were more interested as to where I came from, and why. 


Honestly, I cannot wait until I go again (in Europe, because I'm more likely to go to... Finland or Germany than I am Japan again) because it was incredibly relaxing. Honestly, never thought I'd be saying one of my favourite places to relax was around a bunch of naked men. 


The public bath is a great relaxing experience, don't be shy of going. Don't worry, unless you're surrounded by gorgeous blondes, the chances of you getting a stiffy are super low.

&gt;So how come, might I ask, that you consider one kind to be more effective than the other? Considering of course that what's going in Cataluña has been going on for decades and never has it come to fruition, and that the occupy movement has achieved equally as little?

I would say the Catalonia movement has achieved political representation, while the Occupy movement has actively shunned it. 

&gt;What I'm getting at is that regardless of the adjectives we use (valid, good, effective), you clearly think one form of protest is more [whathaveyou] than the other (the kind that I happen to consider less desirable in the sense that it's anchored in the more primitive and societally-regressive attitudes like xenophobia), when aside from these moral implications, both have been equally unsuccesful in achieving their goals?

I would say that by any measure the occupy movement was a disgrace. A bunch of people finding out they are neither too desperate, nor particularly united to actually achieve any meaningful cohesion. Weekend warriors sort of thing. Their narrative is a still born one.

Now you mistake that I have any love for nationalism. I believe building a shared narrative and thus a shared identity is important in social movement and society in general. And while I might not favor the nationalistic narrative, I recognize that when you're rallying people under a unified banner under a circumstance of difficulty, you don't get to make your symbols on the spot, you rally under what is available. I believe Kemal Ataturk showed this in his overthrow of the 
Ottomans and the creation of a Secular Turkey. The idea of Turkey existed before hand and that allowed people to rally behind it and forge, with some difficulty, a notion of not just Turkey, but what type of place Turkey was. 

There might be a republican spanish movement rallying, there might be a federal one. But this one is rallyed around the Catalan nation, and is achieving a modicum of political thrust, and it is up to those under it decide what that symbol means.

A lot of universities will offer a student ticket for public transport as well. I'd also consider getting a bike, it's usually the student's transportation of choice, at least in summer.

If you live, e.g. in Munich there's very little reason to own a car unless you work somewhere in the suburbs or have kids and need to haul them around a lot. 

In the larger cities (Hamburg, Munich, Berlin, Düsseldorf, etc.) there's usually car sharing services like DriveNow or Flinkster available so you can always sign up for 1-2 of these if you need a car to go to IKEA or on a weekend trip somewhere. The prices are far from cheap but you'll still save so much money compared to owning a car that might just stand around for most of the week.

I wish that were true. These people are the Antifa, and they are supported by government money because of their glorious fight against ""the right"". 

And did you forget about the Green party? I like to call the Antifa ""the Green youth"". Noways the Green party is an establishment party in  Germany, and their leadership was/is full of people with such roots. Our former foreign minister (Fischer) used to not only throw stuff at a safe distance, he went full contact and beat up cops, and Miss Roth, who until recently lead the Green party, used to be the tour manager of the leftist music group Ton, Steine, Scherben - the very guys who invented ""Destroy what destroys you!"" - and routinely called for violence in general. They had a song about beating up ticket checkers damn it!

Now people like Roth, Fischer, and Trittin are old and rich but they still have sympathies for these types - which are largely mirror images of their younger selves. And the 1960s/70s leftist types are not just in the Green party, you can find them even in the CDU.

There is a clear double standard in dealing with right-wing and left-wing crime because of that.

Munich is a complete nightmare regarding apartments. Just head over to /r/Munich and read some of the threads there.  It's also quite common that the pric  is bait. For example you go see the apartment, All is fine and then the agent says that he has 2 competitors that were willing to pay 150€ more per month and if you're willing to raise. The prices in ads are not compulsory, just be aware of that. 

The transfer fee depends on the kitchen and the age of the kitchen. My 10 year old kitchen cost me 100, which was quite good as it included a fridge. A friend of mine had to pay 500 as it was a custom fit one, but he only got a sink, some cabinets and an oven.  I'd say anything between 150 and 300 is the norm.

My German was pretty weak when I came here, (I arrived in June) maybe like an A2 level. This will be by far your biggest hurdle.  If it wasn't for my fiance handling things that require advanced German, they would be near impossible.  The good thing is that most Germans have a decent command of English.  The begin learning in like grade 5.  So, it a rather rare to come across a German who doesn't know any English, at least in city environments. 

I work on German daily and it is improving, I can grasp most things in conversation and on TV/radio.  One thing about Universities, I may be wrong, but I think you have to be a certified C1 speaker to enroll at a German University.  

Finding jobs are tough to say the least.  The most marketable thing about you is your native English, and that whats you need to look for. There are German companies that operate only in English, such as Puma and adidias and I think BMW.  Any they always need native speakers.  If you are a US citizen also look at USAjobs.gov, there are some civilian positions on military bases you could apply for.  

I began looking about a year before my arrival and applying about 6 months prior.  The job I did get was because of my native English and I knew a person who worked there.

Don""t get discouraged though.  I was extremely nervous/scared prior to my arrival.  Things could have really gone south for me, but they worked out.  I am very happy living here, Europe in general is kind of magical to me being an American.  Give it your best shot, if things don't work out you can always come back and at least you have a good experience and you can say you tried.

My understanding as to why France tried this was because she was looking for ways to create closer ties with other countries and was exploring several possibilities. Not sure how serious this one was.

Off topic slightly, but Malta also tried to join the United Kingdom after World War Two. It wanted to become a county. The proposal was refused as Malta was no longer deemed as strategically important and it was felt it could set a dangerous precedent for other colonies to want to join the UK.
