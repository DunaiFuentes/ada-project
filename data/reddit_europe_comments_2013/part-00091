true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; The way the EU is structured, the labour market can't work the way it works in the US. Each country is on its own, they're trying to force the large corporations to stay in their country; they lose too much if the companies leave. The government will have to pick up the tab and pay unemployment benefits, etc for those people laid off.

Most EU countries are bigger than US states and have much more diverse industry and company structure than US states. Even if you would have large company relocating, or going bankrupt, it really wouldn't be felt in the national level.

&gt; In the US, this is not an issue: if a company leaves California for Nevada, it doesn't affect that much the state of California because the unemployment benefits, social security, food stamps, etc. are paid from the federal budget to which the company and the new employees will contribute in the new state.

If you have a very dynamic economy, even if one company or industry sector is feeling down, the rest of the economy will pick up the slack. For example in the same time as Nokia has downsized, the same time other companies in other industry sectors have recruited ex-Nokia employees not to mention all the startups.

&gt; As long as the EU is not going to be a true federation, we can't have a flexible job market.

No. We can and should have flexible job market because that is the only way to create new enterprises and new industries.

I cannot tell you how much better it makes reddit for a thousand different reasons, starting with the expandable images in links (though I also have HoverZoom for Chrome, which provides a similar function)

Tagging is one of those RES features. No, hehe, it's not a text file. Well, not one I keep track of. You can tag someone right on the reddit site and RES will remember it. You can colour-code the tags and use whatever words you wish in the tag. Related feature is vote-weight, which shows the tally of upvotes and downvotes you give to a particular user. 

It's not bias unless you make it such. I only tag when it's helpful, not revenge-tags. I'm the only one who sees tags, so it's only for my good. For instance, I find a guy who stolidly presents Devil's Advocates arguments despite the downvotes. I tag him. Or a guy I see consistently posting good logical stuff. Conversely, I tag all people who are racist or xenophobic. They're warnings. I see those people try to play a different tune in other threads all the time. Tags help get past those deceptions. 

And of course, you can also tag famous redditors. Like that famous sister-panty-sniffing QEDOmelets or something like that. He's a funny guy.

El Parlamento de Cataluña ha hecho esta tarde un acto de soberanía rehusando la petición del PP y Ciutadans de hacer caer del orden del día el debate sobre la creación de la comisión de estudio sobre el derecho de decidir. Lo han pedido en aplicación de la suspensión cautelar de la declaración de soberanía por el Tribunal Constitucional. La propuesta de creación de la comisión -firmada por CiU, ERC, PSC, ICV y CUP- basa su justificación en aplicación de la Declaración de soberanía.

El rechazo de la petición de PP y C's lo han votado CiU, ERC, PSC, ICV-EUiA y CUP. De este modo han decidido desacatar la decisión del TC.

Los diputados del PP han abandonado el hemiciclo un vez rehusada su petición de hacer caer el debate de la orden del día. El portavoz del PP al Parlamento, Enric Millo, ha subido al atril simplemente para anunciar que su grupo no participaría en el debate y votación de este punto de la orden del día al considerarlo un 'hecho de insumisión y desacato' del TC. PP y C's ya han anunciado que no participarán en la comisión.

Finalmente, el parlamento ha aprobado la creación de la comisión del derecho de decidir con los votos favorables de CiU, ERC, PSC, ICV-EUiA y la CUP y los únicos votos en contra de C's, mientras que el PP no ha votado en señal de protesta.

Bulgaria, on the other hand, is drenched in garbage and corruption. Lawlessness, belligerent citizens (of any ethnicity, be it Bulgarian, Turkish, or Roma,) and a dysfunctional beurocracy make for a terrifying world, with no promise of future and riches only for the cruel and ruthless.

The situation is so dire, in fact, that Bulgarian patriots don't romanticise the present, the future, or even the immediate past. There is nothing romantic about it.

They romanticise the distant past: they dream of the fight against the Ottomans, of Haiduks (little more than rebellious vagrants, in truth,) and Vasil Levski, and the oft mentioned first and second Bulgarian Empires (prior to the conquest by the Ottomans in the 15th century.)

Weiteres Problem ist, dass nicht nur Neukunden betroffen sind. Auch bestehende Verträge werden, wenn auch ""erst"" 2016, abgewandelt und dann gedrosselt.

Call it catharsis or even calculism, but it happens. And because politics is usually reduced  to a black and white analysus, corruption can be ignored! especially if the right decisions overshadow the wrong ones. 

Humans and their complexity...

I believe things will forcibly change in Europe. There is very little room left for good decisions that could ever outweigh the bad ones that could keep the crooked system going. As the vices created by the old EU are left unfed, chaos sets in. But this only mirrors the anger of the once privileged elites. Their swansong.

We've lived centuries ahead of the rest of the world and have used up our colonial legacy. The rest of the planet is now obviously trying to catch up.

- Can't recommend a particular hotel, but you should stay away from the city center. Maybe somewhere in ""Eixample"" or ""Gracia""

- Canelons, pa amb tomaquet i pernil, any kind of rice with regional seafood or meat  ... You should also go to the ""Barceloneta"" neighborhood and eat some fresh fish and tapas in ""La cova fumada"" or ""Jaica"", for example. (You can find them in google)

- Cava. There are some good wines from ""Penedès"" or ""Priorat"" regions (among others). 

- As in any city, there are some ""hot spots"" and some more special places. Hot spots: Sagrada Familia, Parc Güell, Ramblas, Casa Batlló, Pedrera, MACBA, CCCB, and the whole center (Raval + Barri Gòtic). You should check the Barceloneta neighborhood and Gracia also, as they have really nice hidden spots (Check the typical Barcelona markets like the Mercat de l'abaceria in Gracia, the gracia squares like ""plaça del sol"" or ""Plaça Virreina"" to have a cold beer, for example). Also check out ""El born"" neighborhood and don't miss Santa Maria del Mar, a gothic church with a really particular history.

- There are several beaches in Barcelona, not astounding but alright. 

- Cosmocaixa (science museum), MNAC (Modern art), MACBA (Contemporary art). Avoid the Picasso museum, not worth it. 

- Metro or bus (Buy a T10 card)

- You can find bars and pubs with Barcelona people in Gracia or Sants. In the center (Raval or gotic) you can find a lot of interesting things, but, although is not as dangerous as it used to be, you should still be careful. 

- Some catalans don't want to be in Spain. Some spanish don't like that. Most people in Barcelona doesn't really give a fuck. You'll have no problem at all.

- Parc Güell is one of my favorites. MNAC and, why not, the Colon Statue in Las Ramblas. 

- Well, it's impossible to visit Barcelona without going through Las Ramblas, but try to avoid them as much as possible. It's a street full of tourist traps and any bar will try to rob you blind with the prices.

- Do not shoot us. Please. 

- September the 11th is the national day in Catalunya / Although in Barcelona you can find some ""Plazas de Toros"", bullfighting was banned in the city some time ago. / Catalunya has some of the most boring folklore of the world but they DO have one great tradition: [Castells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castell)

- You'll be fine speaking english, but anyway: 

Hola/Bon dia (Hi, good morning)

Una cervesa si us plau (One beer, please) - Catalan

On puc trobar la Sagrada Familia? (Where can I find Sagrada Familia?)

A few years ago I worked in Melun for a month, and there is not much to do (and the part of the city I was in was not particularly beautiful), so I guess you'll want to spend a big part of your time in Paris (but do not skip over the others' tips: Vaux le vicomte, Provins, ...)

Apart from that, maybe try another city: Paris is great but France has more to offer than just Paris. Provins or the area is nice, but if you have the ability try to visit another part of the country, maybe in the South (Bordeaux or Toulouse, or Montpellier for example) or in Brittany (where crepes have been invented!): great food and great sights.

Finally when you're in Paris be sure to post here so we can meetup. June is a great season for getting drunk in Paris.

+ He applauded [the Munich Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement), was one of the first to ask to 'lay down arms' to stop the 'fratricidal war' when the Nazis invaded France.


+ [He voted in favor](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_des_pleins_pouvoirs_%C3%A0_Philippe_P%C3%A9tain_le_10_juillet_1940) of aboslishing the National Assembly and granting plenary powers to Petain, head of the Vichy
collaborationist regime.

+ He accepted being nominated as Minister in the Vichy government. When later asked about it, he allegedly ""wasn't aware"" of being nominated. He was the first official to go tchit-tchat with Nazi authorities in France. Nobody know what exactly what happened, but he was then placed
under house arrest. When he escaped, he tried contacting the Vichy authorities, but they explained to him he shouldn't expect anything from them.

+  When the Nazis invade the [Zone Libre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_libre) in response to the the Allied landing in North Africa, he went under and hid in the countryside,
which must have been comfortable during the times of the black market and extreme shortages. Contrary to some biographies, never once will he attempt to contact the Free French Forces.


+ At the Liberation, he was deemed 'nationally unworthy' and banned from government service. Thanks to his connections at the Vatican, de Gaulle waives the sentence. It doesn't mean he had a high opinion of Schuman, he was mainly concerned with reconciliating the French between themselves.

+ Schumann was nominated 10 times as a Minister during the Fourth Republic, infamous for its unstability. His contemporaies said of him that he was 'unremarkable', 'boring', 'lacking imagination', and 'lacking the traits that make great statesmen'.

+ Having to come up with something as the Foreign Minister to solve issues between France and Germany, he gets this declaration from Jean Monnet, who was very close to the Americans.


To conclude, here's a [an excerpt from the Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1356047/Euro-federalists-financed-by-US-spy-chiefs.html):

And another one:

&gt;*The head of the Ford Foundation, ex-OSS officer Paul Hoffman, doubled as head of ACUE in the late Fifties. The State Department also played a role.

There may be some, but is more of a nostalgic feeling than a real perception. It wouldn't help much to be honest. Both of the states are in similar positions in regards to the corruption of the state's officials, overall political culture and the total discontent with the politics. In addition to the total unemployment figures, these are, I belive, the top problems in both of the countries. These would not be resolved, however, if there was a federation, or unification, of Slovakia and the Czech republic, because we are basically the same peoples.
On the other hand, there are some benefits to the idea. 

For instance, our icehockey team would be A LOT stronger than 2 divided teams. Basically the sports would quite benefit, however there would be people counting the number of players of each of the countris, accounting the successes (failures) to the fact that the sportsmen are Slovak/Czech.

The united country might be stronger partner in international relations. History shows that both the nations have had strong relations with the Balkans. We, united, could have played a lot more proactive role, for example, in the dissolution of Yugoslavia.

I'm not sure whether the united country would benefit economically though. Quite probably we would not have Euro as a common currency, since a huge amount of Czechs especially are against it. We, on the other hand, would be in NATO and the EU and their respective agencies.
The economy...In the communist times, when Czechoslovakia still existed, there were quite strong calls from the Slovak side for a more autonomous position within the state. The general perception was that Prague ""dictates"" what was to be done on Slovakia's territory, solely from the point of view of Czech satisfaction. Few people would actually agree that it was the central government, which brought factories (economic growth, jobs) to even the most remote of vallies in parts of central and eastern Slovakia. The fact that at that times economy was centrally planned in a socialist manner, is a whole other thing.

Us, Slovaks, have had this quite strong nationalist feeling. being under Hunagrian control for some 1000 years a lot of politicans (and intelligentsia as such) were calling for a sovereign state of Slovaks, its creation being accounted to the finalization of Slovak emancipation attempts. The feeling among these people is as follows: However beneficial a common state might have been, we care a little, we want a sovereign state. That's it.

Today, Slovakia and the Czech republic have a very healthy and good relationship, so do the peoples. We have basically the same language, our nature is similar, we understand each othe better than we do Polish people or other Slavonic nations. Our countries have implemented a number of treaties that in a way stir the difference that we are actually two separate states. Even in times the countries were not in the EU (Schenge) people could travel without border checks, could work, live&amp;study freely, speak their mother tongue, would marry citizens of CZ/SK, raise their children to shared  values and so on.

So, even though the countries are separete now, peoples of both countries seem unaffected by that, although there is little feeling that they should re-unite.",0,1368091106,null,0,1368092059,0,c9ve91c,t3_1dzlzx,t1_c9ve91c,t3_1dzlzx,null,1431251737,46,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,46

Believe me, this is a very simplistic way of putting it, but t's about a culture of innovation, a culture of creativity, a culture of experimentation, a culture of confidence, a culture of leadership, a culture of dogged work ethic, etc and all the systems and institutions needed to support them. 

The only reason that Europe is in the financial troubles it is in at the moment as it pertains to the housing fraud is that the European banks got suckered by our institutions, the sane way they have been so many times over. It is about who is running the show, whatever show that may be. And we run the show because of all of the above.

That doesn't really preclude though that the vast majority of Americans are not also partially taken advantage of or used as merely a means to an end of success. The biggest difference between the USA and Europe though is exemplified in the number of monarchs that exist in each market.

When a culture of social station exists, that demoralizes and demotivates creativity and innovation and success, it does not even start; the building blocks of life do not form into primitive proteins that form into complex that form into simple called organisms, etc, etc.

You may scoff, but I have very good broad and deep insight into both worlds. Don't discount the fact that the very thing I am saying acts as a damper, among many other factors, is also the very thing that is putting pressure on that innovation in the USA; the income / wealth inequality.

But I don't think that explains why the recent big Internet and consumer electronics innovations that revolve around online and mobile come from the US. 

My personal theory is that the US is the biggest first world open market economy in the world. It can focus all the talent in 50 states and among a population of 300 million in a particular location. This being silicon valley for instance. A New Yorker or Texan can move to Cali in a heart beat.

Another factor is that a company based in Cali has instant access to the entire American market, large as it is.

I do not particularly enjoy seeing people being discriminated against on the basis of their nationality. Public perception of both Romanians and Bulgarians and their respective countries is extremely warped in the West and trying to pin all of society's current problems on them, as happened with the Polish back in 2004, does this Union a diservice. 

Every single time Bulgaria and Romania are portrayed in Western media it is usually in a negative manner. I remember a video done by the BBC in regards to the recent immigration scare in the UK. It essentially painted Romania and Bulgaria as complete and total shitholes even though the documentary itself was trying to disprove the massive immigration myth. This sort of thing is fucking endemic even though it's not true. 

&gt;In either case, like I said, I see no reason to dismiss the UK stats on crime because there is no reason why the UK police would single out the Romanians when there are so many other immigrants in the UK, a good number of them vastly different from the native Brits.

I am not dismissing them, I am merely suggesting the reasons for those stats are complicated. 

&gt;And like you just said, the Poles get the most flack. 

Statistically speaking, even though crime in the polish community has decreased in 2012 they are still leading by total amount. However, to say that in 2013 the polish are the center of attention so to speak is wrong.

I'd be more sympathetic to the ideology of austerity if the long term benefits were palpable. But let's face it - assuming say, Spain, fixes everything, are they going to simply sprout economically viable home-grown industries that employ fucktonnes of people? Will international companies chose to build offices in Spain over countries with a cheaper workforce, like Romania? I doubt it. The best that can be said for austerity is that it is a way of dealing with some pressing problems that needed to be solved anyway, and prevent countries with bad reputations from looking any worse investment-wise.

The one limitation I'd like to expand on is that Germany didn't subsidise their workers but the employer-side of the economy.

I probably wouldn't say that, generally, workers are better off being unemployed than having a low-pay job. This is a very deep and difficult issue in itself to discuss.

What happened in Germany is that employers could and still can rely on the community of tax payers when it comes to cutting down costs to a lower level than ever before.

These subsidies helped paint a picture of a perfectly functioning economy.

Some aspects of such a heavily subsidised economy include:

* Business models that are not sustainable get a free ride leading to a certain overhead in the long run - one might also call this a ""bubble"".

* Providing money for unsustainable businesses with faulty business models hinders innovation and progress. This again is to be seen in a long term context.

* Last, certainly not least, if wages are being paid by tax payers, and not by the employer, the employer's (private) profit will increase and the value the tax payer expects to get in return for his taxes paid will decrease.

true,keepthepace,FRAN,France,"Sorry, what is the question exactly? Austerity is a bad policy that doesn't work, everyone begins to now accept this fact, so just stop it. Why do you want to replace it by something else? Just stop it. Stopping it would just mean that countries should be allowed to run a deficit during crisis.

&gt; Yet austerity is not about to end. For countries in bail-out programmes, less of it means asking creditors for bigger loans (or a debt write-off). And nobody seriously suggests fiscal stimulus: the only question is how far deficit-cutting should be slowed. 

Well, here is your solution : more fiscal stimulus. ""Nobody seriously suggesting it"" is not an argument at all. Everyone ""serious"" was for austerity a few years ago. Kickstart growth by raising demand, rebalance profits from capitals and profit from wages, and there you go.

If you remove the theory of austerity, you are left with the theory of the stimulus. This is ""what is after austerity."" I hope it doesn't take another 10 years to realize it.

Even without fiscal stimulus, we could simply allow countries like Greece have a deficit over 10% of GNP and fund them through loans accordingly. During a harsh crisis, they are doomed to have low GNP and very high benefit costs. Stimulus would help make this situation temporary instead of permanent.

&gt; France will be a test-case. It is likely to get another year to meet its target, in exchange for a promise of more structural reforms.

Seriously, the Economist is not making any in depth analysis on its subjects. France has gone away with big deficits since forever, like most countries of the EU. Every year the EU says ""this is bad, don't do that."" and every year, France answers ""Oh yeah, so what? Want us to leave?""

Hollande did promise far less than what austerians would like. He made half-assed promises that are quite modest, and that can be dismissed when France wants.",0,1368105915,null,0,1368108130,0,c9vgg9i,t3_1dznxw,t1_c9vgg9i,t3_1dznxw,null,1431250700,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

Even Flanders and the Netherlands have diverged on many areas culturally as well as politically as to make unification of the Dutch language area pretty impossible and even undesirable.

First of all, there's the culture difference: Flanders is Roman Catholic and always has had quite a Romance influence in our culture that the classic Dutch Calvinists didn't have. In that field, we're definitely closer to our Walloon neighbors than we are to the Dutch peoples from above the Rhine river. That's also visible differencec in the basic approach to life (rigid rules up north vs a bit more pliability 'here') and in personal communication (very direct up north, more contextual, conservative rules 'here')

I do feel more connected to Dutch people from below the Rhine river than I do to Wallonia and I wouldn't mind to see a North-Netherlands (Rhine and up) and a South-Netherlands (Flanders+Brabant/Limburg/maybe Zeeland, Gelderland) ... but that's a historical impossibility by now.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; But that is all dependent on what the time parameters are for each country, and how each country is doing with regards to that. These powers surely don't apply to the UK and Denmark, but only those that joined after the € was introduced.

Finland joined the EU in 1995, and joined the Eurozone in 1999, the Maastricht treaty obligations were known in 1992 when EC membership negotiations were started. That is 7 years, or 4 years, depending on from where you count. That should be enough for most countries. Lets not forget that many countries have fulfilled their treaty obligations, and fast: Slovenia (3 years), Malta (4 years), Cyprus (4 years), Slovakia (5 years) and Estonia (7 years). 

What goes to UK and Denmark, while the EU doesn't have power in this case to throw them out, adequate power should and could be used to make a case of either leave the union or adopt the Euro. Like I said before, a single market without single currency makes the market untenable in long run.

&gt; The sort of process you outline would take several years at the minimum, probably well over a decade (considering some states that joined in 2004 still haven't adopted the €, and that's 9 years ago). If over 10 years after the Eurocrisis (and with the € performing strongly) these nations still don't want € membership then there is something fundamentally wrong with the currency.

It doesn't matter do these countries want to join the Euro or not, they have treaty obligation to do so. If they don't do so, then they are breaking their treaty obligations not only towards the EU but towards all other member states. Usually if one participant of treaty decides to break it, then that treaty it is void.

true,AntisocialScientist,NRHW,U. A. M. R.,"Not a big fan of this article, but then again I'm biased. Let's dig in.

His first remark is that Europe exploded because too many countries were added. But the issue in my opinion is not that the EU got too large, but that one section of it, the Eurozone, went too deep but simulteanously not deep enough. By the way, before I proceed, I have to say how much I love that schizophrenic logic: People who at the same time claim that the Euro was a bad idea to begin with, but that if the involved countries just had to do it, they should at least have doubled down on it.

The next remark, that not the EU but NATO is responsible for peace in Europe because the French parliament vetoed the EDC ignores that in its stead a similar yet not all that encompassing Western European Union was created as a mutual defense pact bloc. More importantly, I don't see how one can actually prove which of these three parallely existing organisations was responsible for peace in Europe in the end. Personally, I credit the Soviet Union, as it is difficult to fight amongst each other when a foe that is ten times as big lurks outside the gates.

He then ends his political evaluation and goes on to economics, starting with growth rates. Quite frankly, I think that is ridiculous. If you actually take a look at American GDP growth rates you'll notice that the trend for the United States and Canada is also 'slower growth', that average growth and the band of peaks and troughs is becoming more narrow for them, too. There's the bit about Europe's GDP as part of the global GDP that makes me hope that he's not seriously implying that 700 million people could out-produce the other 90% of humanity forever. But I'll concede that Europe grows slower and has on average a higher unemployment rate than the US. 

The thing about equity markets, however, confuses me slightly seeing how all markets around the world got obliterated and then carried to new highs based almost entirely on central bank money within the last five years. Their usefulness as an indicator is right now very much in doubt, I'd say.

He then changes course entirely and basically tells the reader to forget everything we just read by switching 'the reason why the European project has failed' from 'results' to 'means', specifically saying that the project has failed because it lost legitimacy. Why has it lost legitimacy? I don't see that being explicitely said, but I'll assume that basically he wants us to 'see above'. But when I read claims about how Europe does not enjoy legitimacy or trust right now I always take a look at the Eurobarometer.

Because it's not like people are saying ""Europe doesn't work, let's go back to the nation-state, that does work"". Trust in national and European institutions moves in lockstep, they move up or down together. People are now trusting neither the EU nor their own governments, from which I personally conclude that the crisis is not one of Europe alone, but of governance in general.",0,1368111810,null,0,1368112036,0,c9vi5p1,t3_1e00y9,t1_c9vi5p1,t3_1e00y9,null,1431249896,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15

There are a lot of activities and beautiful areas in the city for recreation. There are about 10 lakes near the city that are really beautiful as well as a nice castle with a very pretty garden where you can go hang out with your friends.

I would say this comes from Netherlands and France refusing the European Constitution in 2005 by referendum, and then, against the people's will, having it adopted anyway by parliaments ratifying the 2007 Lisbon treaty. The article mentions how the referendum was presented twice to Ireland, as if the only correct answer to it could be 'Yes'.

&gt;But when I read claims about how Europe does not enjoy legitimacy or trust right now I always take a look at the Eurobarometer.

Try asking the Portuguese now living in Angola, the elderly in Greece who have to search in trash bins for food and can't afford medicine, the youth in Spain, mini-jobs holders in Germany. The Eurobarometer seems to be an extension of the Commission. Okay. Eurostat is as well, and the way Eurostat present their monthly documents hides the fact that unenmployment shrinks in member states outside of the Eurozone. Coming from an institution that prides itself on being objective, that's highly dishonest.

I can't remember national governments reaching fresh-out-of-WW2 unemployment rates on their own.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America," Your last sentence is particularly interesting. I have argued on this sub reddit to no avail that it is indeed the government that is the source of the problem. Too many people think that the government a)has the ability to solve every issue in society and b) has the duty to solve every issue in society. Now it can be argued that government is not solver of all problems, but is the source of all problems. Either through institutionalized corruption, or naive social programs that rapidly become bloated and insolvent. Too many European countries have this messiah complex where they believe countries around the globe will laud their efforts to take in illiterate immigrants and provide for all their needs. And instead of other countries following suit by taking care of their own citizens, and the citizens of other countries, they laugh and view those policies as removing the burden from them.

And where has these nobel policies left many countries? It has left them with ghetto-ized urban areas off limits to the locals. In addition, it is up to the tax payers to pay for these feel good notions that Europe is the savior of the worlds poor. You guys suffer the highest taxes of the industrialized world, and you have to ask: Is it worth the warm fuzzy feeling you get inside to play the part of the savior? Does the idea that the government should be responsible for everything need to be reevaluated? If the citizens of so many countries are barely getting, why should they give up half their paycheck to fund a government that is demonstrably corrupt and/or incompetent?

I always thought that the inherent skepticism about government was a uniquely American phenomenon, and the absolute trust in government was a European phenomenon. Perhaps I am wrong in thinking this because my window into Europe is limited to media, and I am not there in the caffes or pubs across Europe engaging in political discussion. But maybe this crisis will lead many to rethink their beliefs on what the size and scope of government should be, and whether it is worth the costs. In my opinion, such a discussion can only be a good thing.",0,1368118135,null,0,false,0,c9vkblh,t3_1e00y9,t1_c9vkblh,t1_c9vi5p1,null,1431248803,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

If you want to argue against government intervention, you have to be consistent.

It's not a metal or a mineral they're accused of cornering. It's a progressing technology. If prices go back up on the cheaper end of the scale, alternative production will start elsewhere.[...]

Hyperbole.

&gt;It's obvious that you can't conjure up a whole manufacturing industry in a matter of weeks. And if you don't have the industry, where would you get the expertise?

This is going on the assumption that everything just stops, leaves and/or disappears.  It's a nursery argument.  Those in the industry themselves are saying that protectionism poses a far greater risk.

They do what developed European economies have been doing for some time now.  They target the bespoke high end of the market.  Quality over quantity.  Markets would simply readjust.  

You're talking as if China doesn't already produce quantity over quality.

&gt;It shows how badly informed you are when you think that R&amp;D expensens aren't exempt already.

Some are, some aren't.  There's plenty of expenses R&amp;D still incur, and there's plenty to do that could  encourage private investment.  One could provide even cheaper capital for the GIB, for instance.

&gt;China has been keeping their currency artifically low for decades. Who started a trade war here?  

Let them.  Their choice.  We have different economies and specialities, it's lead to cheaper consumerism, they've actually been working on raising it because they want to externalise and are eyeing up a place in SDRs, and the USD has been kept artificially high.

Investors want to maximise their profits and will abstain from using their money unless they see a very good bargain. In the absence of very good bargains, they will just wait it out, which is what is creating the current problem. 

Can we create a system that is more rational? Fundamentally, that would require a complete overhaul of our economic system.

1. Austerity should be limited to practical levels. Austerity has a sweet spot where you can reduce expenditure without completely kicking the crap out of your economy. That is what the UK is currently targeting. More or less 1% of GDP off the deficit each year.

2. Overall spending shouldn't change much in the short term. There is a difference between the deficit, the primary deficit and the structural deficit. Overall the latter two are what we should be targeting. The fear is not the debt going up. The fear is not even being in a position where the debt can drop. So in the short term we should be focusing more on migrating ongoing dead money towards capital expenditure and reinvestment. This will actually allow you to run real austerity faster because you use capital spending to soften the fall and widen your margins for structural cuts.

Still clinging to the illusion of national self-determination? The UK doesn't exist in a vacuum either.

&gt;Hyperbole.

No, reality. Outsourcing labor-intensive parts happens daily, and sooner or later the leftover administrative division vanishes in a round of cost-cutting.

&gt;This is going on the assumption that everything just stops, leaves and/or disappears.

Well, that *is* what the involved industry bigwigs are constantly threatening us with. Are they lying?

&gt;Those in the industry themselves are saying that protectionism poses a far greater risk.

That's just the installers, who'd rather not see the price of their merchandise rise... even if it would harm other parts of the economy in the long run.

&gt;Some are, some aren't.

No wriggling out of that. As long as they're expenses related to the enterprise, they're deductible as costs and VAT exempt as well. You're just parrotting the ""taxes are the source of all evil"" line you're being fed.

&gt;One could provide even cheaper capital for the GIB, for instance.

So.... subsidize it, you mean? I thought you said you were perfectly consistent?

&gt;We have different economies and specialities

But when everything is said and done, when you're dependent on somebody else for basic inputs they *will* fleece when they get the chance. Remember the oil crisis. And don't think you can run an economy on fishy financial transactions forever.

&gt; it's lead to cheaper consumerism

What a consolation for the unemployed masses.

&gt;they've actually been working on raising it 

It's a matter of policy change, it does require very little work. So if it has not happened, it's because they don't want it.

&gt;This is most definitely about EU protectionism.
Damn, you're imperialistic.

In case you don't already know: Good apartments in Cologne/ Bonn are extremely rare at the moment and there is a highly competitive demand.

Le libéralisme, bien sur, ils pigent vaguement. Il faudrait donner du crédit à 
des gens qui votent FN par défaut, par manque de culture politique? 

Ton argument pour dire que les jeunes ne sont plus contre le FN, c'est de dire

Sure, I kind of live and move about in a bit of a bubble, but things are not as bad as it is portrayed, as I have seen it in European news and periodicals. Things do seem very on edge, and there seems to be a sense that things are definitely not totally secure yet, but it also feels like rather than fretting about what might happen, we have a resiliency (some call it ignorance) that allows us to forge ahead in the face of adversity. What good does fretting do? none.

Re the internet and consumer electronics innovations. Its a multifaceted issue, but here are some points I believe come into play on aggregate:

* Have a lot of disposable income, relative to other places
* Are rather stupid about money management
* Hence why our sales and adoption rates leave other places in the dust
* We have a very free and creative culture (in certain areas that are important), 
* Our Universities, albeit not qualitatively superior, but it opens up continued education on a sum total larger scale (although I think that's reaching a rather risky cliff).
* We are highly mobile still....we travel around have family and friends in multiple states and just move around not just for travel, but for work and advancement and to pursue opportunities (which EU language and culture barriers kind of tamp down)
* I don't buy your large American market thing (beyond that it definitely helps), but that is a quintessential point too..... we are just crazy innovative and go-getters and get-shit-done.....cowboys, if you will. I know what you mean, because even Facebook almost fell on their face when they did not regionalize and many other US companies did. There is that German brother duo that is the bane of Silicon valley and would probably be shot on sight for wholesale pirating and ripping off American innovation because the American startups didn't think beyond US borders. But the point is, and maybe I'm wrong about this very notion, but I think that if the current cultural ethos faced the complication of all the cultural diversity and languages; we would be working on finding a solution that would bridge that gap through technology. That might even be an opportunity that Europe is sitting on in and will cry foul when they are shown up by Americans (specifically, Google). What if the solution to the diversity and language issue is perfecting natural language processing and making cross language communications seamless. But I really feel like Europe is significantly falling behind, especially when you look at how quickly China and India have adapted and become a coding behemoths. And that is related to the following...
* We don't have such a culture of comfort and satisfaction and are far more manic and balls-to-the-wall and get-shit-done. That has to do with the lack of overly coddling society and social net, I am sure of it. When humans get too comfortable and don't have to worry about pressures and risks, they become .... surprise.... comfortable and complacent and like to sit on their laurels. A little risk, insecurity, pain, discomfort, and adversity goes a long way to spur creativity and action. Look at our best musicians, one story after another of poverty, pain, suffering, discrimination, and racism. Don't get me wrong, I don't advocate for that, but it is undeniable that humans are rather bipolar and seem to do their best work when under duress of stress and extremes. 
* We have an investor class that is supported and encouraged by their usurer profits and fund all kinds of things in ways that I think blows sober Europeans' mind. Millions here, millions there, to invest in companies that won't be and aren't profitable for years, if ever. So many American companies die that most Americans don't even ever hear of, let alone Europeans. For every Facebook or Twitter or Google there are 100,000 carcases of other startups that sucked billions from investors. It is how America has operated for a very long time, even if it is a rather extreme situation at the moment. This is a total shift of how humans interact and engage with knowledge and information and Europe is sitting on the sidelines diddling while America is inventing what is essentially paper, the book, the printing press, the library, the university, and industry. 
* Are culturally admired because of our care-free, fun, somewhat reckless and brash worry-free nature. I am sure I don't have to elaborate. 
* Immense natural resources to squander and give us humongous margins for error. I think that speaks for itself. European monarch and aristocrats have been at it a long time, pilfering the relatively few natural resources that are available in Europe. It has been going on far less long here and we have far more of them. And that's essentially where all wealth comes from......natural resources. 

I am sure there are other things that play into this matter that I just don't feel like listing or thinking of and this is in no way a well refined list and only represents a rough collection; but there you have it. 

In case it came across that way, I am not implying any kind of negative connotation. I like Europe and I like it's diversity in culture and language. It would be a shame if it were lost, but without something like natural language processing being perfected into seamless translation, there is not hope for Europe to cast off one of the drags that holds it back, nor really a way that the diversity can be preserved as there will be more and more pressure to homogenize.

As a Californian, i naturally brought with me jeans, vans shoes, t-shirt, hoodie. I was comfortable, but felt under dressed. I was once told on the bus by an italian woman that i wouldn't have to worry about getting robbed because it doesn't look like i had any money. 

I'm positive that there are italians that are not concerned about being fashionable, but it's apparent that fashion is a part of their culture. It seems to come naturally to them. (People in Florence were all damn good looking, how does that even happen??)

Everyone seems to wear the nicest shit over there! Guys in big cities seem to all be wearing suites and Ray Bans. I wish I looked that cool when I go to work haha. Although there were some crowds that thought i dressed ""cool"", I wished i would have dressed more nice. 

Women in Italy are dressed super fashionable in major cities. I was amazed to notice a beautiful, well dressed girl (heels, long skirt, leather jacket) step out of a bar, roll, light &amp; smoke her cigarette, put on a helmet, and then ride off on her motorbike. 

Dress business casual to help fit in. I suggest bringing a few polos or comfortable dress shirts that don't wrinkle too bad. Bring a light weight sport jacket or something tight fitting if you wanna blend in. Wear a sloppy hoodie with a camera around your neck if you want to be touristy.

I am not really one to advocate that it has to do with the simple size of our market, even though it is arguably the largest. If you qualify it in that we tend to be the early adopters and the innovators you get a different picture. The economies of scale favor the first, and if we are the market makers, we have a huge head start. By ""we"" I, of course, speak on a cultural and societal level but that holds true. We have our experience with winner takes all and I think that culture is even partially part of our identity.

Especially the German market is hugely successful and an impressive juggernaut of quality production and even of innovation. So don't get me wrong, but he question was primarily about the success of internet and consumer electronics types of industries; not necessarily industrial equipment and parts. That is actually, especially Germany's weakness, Germany still suffers from a battered and self-loathing and self-harming cultural identity that has taken to mimicking American culture in a rather awkward way. You just cannot be the leader and market maker of culture, style, design, art, creativity, pleasure, leisure, and things of human experience when you don't know who you are. Germany still won't let go of what a bad bad thing it did 75 years ago. It's sad. you can't make the iPad and iTunes and have fun when a cloud of self-cutting dark-emo guilt and shame hovers over your cultural identity. I know that's a bit of a stretch, but the point is that Germans and European culture, in general, is a lot more conformist and restrained, which does not lend itself to experimentation and innovation and risky behavior that has paid off in our particular set of circumstances.

I know that (at least for some time last year, I’m not sure if they still do it) the tiny grocery store in the Munich train station did not, for example, sell frozen pizza after the mandated closing time (Mo-Fr after 8pm) or on Sundays and Holidays.

The reason for this is that gas stations and shops in train stations or resting stops on the motorway are by law allowed to stay open, however only for the purpose of serving those who are traveling. (Actually, pretty much exactly to be open for someone like the OP, who would otherwise be stranded without any easy ways to get stuff.) Since travelers tend to not have a refrigerator and oven with them – this, at least, seems or seemed to be the reasoning of the responsible Bavarian authority – selling this stuff after official opening times is not ok.

Other states are not as restrictive with their laws as Bavaria. (Who would have guessed?) I mean, the shops in the Hamburg train station (including one rather large grocery store – maybe ten times the size of the one in the Munich train station – that is always overflowing with people on Holidays or Sundays) are aggressively advertising the fact that they are open until 11pm seven days a week, specifically targeting people who forgot to do their grocery shopping some other time of the week, certainly not travelers. (Hamburg, like many Germany states, has by now a relatively liberal – compared to Bavaria – 6x24h opening hours law. Most stores, however, still close down at 10pm at the latest. As I recently found out, however, there are some grocery stores dotted around Hamburg that are open until 11.30pm or something like that.)

To quickly and again address the OP’s question: You should be fine. Getting stuff to eat in Nuremberg on a Sunday is not a problem (practically all restaurants should be open, all fast food places, even things like food carts and the like, also bakeries and cafes), but if I were you I would wait with the grocery shopping. If you want to do it you should try your luck at the train station or airport or at some gas station. It’s gonna be expensive and the selection will be awful. (But, if I remember correctly, the Nuremberg train station has no real grocery store in it that is open on Sundays. There is something tiny, like in Munich, but they sell mostly stuff to drink, sweets and snacks.)",0,1368140308,null,0,1368140591,0,c9vsa3i,t3_1e0oor,t1_c9vsa3i,t1_c9vra32,null,1431244983,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Don't wear a lot of different colours, and try to use different accessories of the same colour(for example if your shoes are yellow and you have a black dress, use a belt or a necklace of the same yellow).
Use dresses that fit your body and  that bring out your waist.
