@Tagaris:
I don't think the Gleichheitsgrundsatz works here. I'm not a lawyer but this law is referring to other parts in social life. Nevertheless the tax system as it is now is too complex and partially unfair. Butt see for yourself:

Criticism and reform
The current income tax system in Germany is critical and a reorganization is discussed. However, the parties Bündnis 90/Die Grünen (the Greens), die Linken (left wing party) and the FDP (liberal democratic party) demand the abolition of payroll tax classes III and V. While the first two parties want to abolish entirely, the income splitting (ie the distribution of the total family income in the taxation based equally on both partners want) the Liberals want to keep it in principle. In their view, studies have shown that in the system of Ehegattensplitting (income splitting of spouses) the tax class V work incentives for second earners diminish, and the more the further apart the income of the spouse become. The high relative tax burden are therefore not accepted by those concerned. This applies more to the mini-jobs: They are subject to lump-sum taxation and are therefore not affected by the high tax burden on the income tax bracket V. A change from mini to a better paying job means that in tax class V the tax burden increases dramatically.

In 2009, the introduction of class IV with factor was introduced. This was officially justified by the fact that it previously had an inadequate incentive to take a job in tax class V and for this to change from III to IV.


Here we go:

For the beginning:

For workers in the Federal Republic of Germany, the payroll tax deduction and the deduction of solidarity surcharge and church tax, if determined by the chosen tax categorie on the tax card (every worker in Germany gets one when he/she is starting their work. It just consists of your personal tax identification number and the the tax categorie). The Income Tax Act provides six income tax classes. Where an employer does not employ automated payroll, the payroll tax is determined using the income tax table available in specialist bookshops. Income tax, solidarity surcharge and church tax must withhold and remit to the tax authorities of employers in each payroll from gross wages. A certified allowance on the tax card is deducted from taxable wages before applying the payroll tax table.


Lohnsteuerklasse I (1) (Tax class 1)
The first class is relevant for  the following workers:

Singles
Married, whose spouse is limited to tax. 
Married, living permanently separated and widowed (from the next year after the death of the spouse) or divorced 
people living in a registered civil partnership,

Tax class I does not apply if the conditions for tax class III or class IV control met.

The number of child allowances is entered on the tax card.


Lohnsteuerklasse II (2) (Tax class II)
The control class II applies to single parents, for which the conditions of the present tax class I and who are entitled to the tax allowance for single parents.

For widows with at least one child this tax class applies from the beginning of the month following the month of death of the spouse or the spouse. However, this affects the so-called splitting grace. The miraculous splitting causes to which the spouse is deceased in the year, the lower tax rate of joint assessment applies.


Lohnsteuerklasse III (3) (Tax class III)
The third class is relevant for the following people:

Married couples who do not live permanently separate and have not chosen the tax class IV. Also the working spouse then receives the control class V. Even if the other spouse is not employed or self-employed, the income tax class 3 is assigned.
Widowed by the end of the year following the calendar year of the spouse's death.
The deceased spouse must have been at the time of his death liable to income tax.
The couple may not have lived permanently separated until the time of death.


Lohnsteuerklasse IV (4) (Tax clas IV)
In the control class IV contains married employees, if both spouses are liable to income tax and are not permanently separated.

However, if a tax card with the tax class III was issued for a spouse, the other does not fall in tax class IV, but in tax class V.

The payroll tax classes IV / IV (as opposed to III / V) should be selected from spouses where both earn about the same amount. If there are no other compelling reasons to file an income tax return, this is optional. However, as with tax class IV / IV - especially in very different income spouse - will be deducted too much tax during the year, usually results in the submission of a tax return to a tax refund. At the end of the year, it is advisable, therefore, to expect the result of an income tax return sample.

Spouses who are both employed, the tax class can change once a year leave (§ 39 para 6 ITA).

Tax class IV (4) by a factor [edit] Since the 2010 assessment period exists for married couples an ""optional factor method"" (§ 39f ITA). The factor is determined from the expected together after splitting method to income tax payable in proportion to the notional amount of the payroll tax for each tax class IV The application is permitted, if the factor is less than 1.


Lohnsteuerklasse V (5) (Tax class V)
A tax card with the tax class V permit (§ 38b No. 5), if both spouses apply for the other spouse to be classified in the tax class III. This will be the case if the parties have very different high income. Receives the higher income tax class III and Low income earners the tax class V, possibly too little tax withheld (higher liquidity during the year). The submission of a tax return at the end is therefore mandatory (§ 46 para 2 No. 3a) if both spouses have had income.


Lohnsteuerklasse VI (6) (Tax class VI)
The Tax class VI is entered when a worker needs an income tax card for a second or subsequent employment. Moreover, the employer is required to withhold income tax on the tax class VI when the employee wage tax card culpably fails to produce. Current income tax bracket caused the highest tax rate, because no amount of relief except the age allowances are taken into account. Since the income of the first employment are not known here much more will be retained as in the other tax brackets.

There *is* an internal mechanism for a Member State leaving. Art. 50 TEU reads:

&gt;1. Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.

&gt;2. A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.

&gt;3. The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.

&gt;4. For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it.

&gt;A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

If the UK simply stopped listening, then it would be fined etc. The UK doesn't send MEPs to the Parliament, its residents do. So, that's not an issue for the UK government, but the residents.

Not angry enough, because we don't really seem to understand how any of this works. We're furious this time because the NSA does *so much* at the same time. We're less furious when our governments publicly announce they want to e.g. filter child porn, because the population in general does not understand how that would work on a technical level and does not really realize how it affects privacy. So we're easy to trick, just claim you want surveillance so we can get rid of something bad.

In Germany we've had a few cases where the population was not *too* interested. There was some noise, but not enough to effect change. E.g. our telecom companies were required by law to store all connection data for six months. This law was only annulled because some smart people brought it before the constitutional court, which ruled it unconstitutional. But there wasn't even enough public outcry to make politicians stop suggesting this again and again every time some act of terrorism happens somewhere.

Perché? Uno può credere nella premessa di base di una dottrina, ma non necessariamente accettare acriticamente tutta la tradizione accumulatasi nel corso dei secoli, soprattutto se essa viene da un'istituzione con propri interessi.

Se quest'istituzione, che è stata un vero e proprio regno, ha preso una piega non proprio lodevole, rinnegare l'esistenza di un essere superiore non è affatto una conseguenza logica necessaria, anche se ho visto molti seguire questo ragionamento, più o meno.

Inoltre, che tutto l'universo sia nato, si sia sviluppata la vita, e addirittura una vita senziente ed autocosciente, e tutto ciò sia successo per puro caso onestamente mi pare molto più difficile da credere (almeno per me) rispetto al fatto che ci sia qualcos'altro.

Leggendo i Vangeli, poi, onestamente l'idea che sia stato tutto scritto ed inventato di sana pianta per ingannare la gente francamente non regge.

I'm not sure that even Germans understand the pricing of Deutsche Bahn.

If you book soon enough, you can get cheap train seats (starting from 29 euros per trip) for almost any route. However, if you don't, it kind of depends on where you want to go and which class of train you're in (ICE is faster, therefore a lot more expensive). 

I live in Munich. If I were to travel to Hamburg, say, tomorrow, my cheapest option would be the normal fare - 139 €. One way. If I wait a month or two, I might get a cheaper fare. Since you're planning on travelling spontaneously, this is simply not an option for you.

Then there's the Bahn card. You can buy a card which makes travelling by train a bit cheaper (25 to 50%), but it costs extra money. 

So, yeah, if the Deutschandpass is valid during the time of your travel, it's the best option, especially since it lets you book ICE trains. 

However, you might want to reserve a seat on the train in any case, which will cost extra.

There are other travel options here as well, Mitfahrzentrale or Mitfahrgelegenheiten (basically, peer-organized car sharing). You can look up a destination of your choosing on the internet and find someone with a car who wants to go there. Most of the people there are at least able to speak English, so you could try to use that.

Unlike you however I view this NSA situation as a product reflecting the true condition of American society. The point needs to be made you are quite rightly critical of the NSA programme, i am critical of the society that gave rise to it. I would argue D. Cheyney has so drastically undermined your society's institutions there is no one in Europe equal to his destruction. **I see cause, you see symptom.**

You do me a disservice by comparing senior execs, with travelers. Australian travelers are often a differing age by virtue of not being CEO's, CFO's, etc. 

The UK. Yes I am unashamedly a Europhile, however, one with I hope an eye as critical of Europe as the US. I don't think you should make me out to be some slavish stereotype, stereotypes are for generalisations. Ok won't do that again.

Is Britain part of Europe and in what sense?Physically yes and as a consequence of the treaty. With their heart, attitude and institutions barely. I would argue Britain as an anglophone nation unsurprisingly shares many characteristics of the US situation by virtue of the US being a fragment society of Britain. Shared processes if not institutions. Logical positivism was a UK/USA/Australia/NZ/Canadian orientation never a continental one, for example. Australia has shafted Asagne, Britain saved one lost a few to your judicial system. GCHQ works in the sense of the Russian threat not against the British people. Britain handled the IRA threat because the authorities always had insiders, far less so with the radicalised Muslims in Britain. Still, not a sufficient reason. As one who thinks greatly of Mancur Olson I see his reasoning of what happens when growth stalls as a good explanation of a cannibalizing society. Britain exploited the world, especially the Irish, as well as its working classes. Britain has made the same gross errors as the USA in spying on its people. It should be equally condemned. 

Continental Europe is different. Western Europe has survived 2 major wars and seen the consequences of the Russian infection. The Stasi had 1 in 3 spying on their neighbours. The Marshall plan saved Europe and millions rightly thank the US. That came at a cost though. Anyhow, I argue wholeheartedly that Europe since WW2 has given serious consideration to the individual primarily because European society is so community orientated. From experience. No Dutch tradesman goes through the backdoor of a house, as is often expected in England, as they are as reasonably equal in education and social standing as the house owner. Europe is class orientated but individual effort is highly respected concomitantly. Danish taxation levels are extremely high however the level between richest and poorest is far less than the USA. I'd argue because it is a smaller society less people can afford to be expendable and a greater community sense of belonging ensues. No gun culture for the masses in Europe. What I'm saying about continental Europe is that spying evidently goes on but I'd argue with the publication of Kafka's *The Trial* and proximity of Russian purges and show trials that data and the way the governments treat their people is with far more respect than the US government does for its people. Compare how the Pirate Bay is being handled compared to Megaupload. No respect for existing law for the second, reasonable due process for the PB except where the US govt threatened the Swedes. [Why we have the current Australian ambassador is because of his Hollywood kick arse associations. Shame there was no prosecution of the US chap who successfully chopped the Australian film industry off at the knees in the 70's. See Phillip Adams for that one.]

Sweden is not some Utopia. For a quick and accessible understanding of their society to an English speaker, inductive as it may be, may I suggest the Dogme films like Festen if you haven't already seen them. It is very hard to break an individuals rights in Europe, especially the more north you go. For example look at employment law in Western European countries. It favours the individual (not the worker,) it is not socialism or communism rather you as an individual will not be subsumed by the corporation, by the firm, you are worth something in your own right. You as an individual have a net basic worth as part of society reflected in the laws and institutions of Western Europe. In the US, Britain and Australia this has eroded dramatically in the past decade. Sorry for the ramble.

I lived in many places, UK, Austria, had projects all over the continent, read a lot of books, a keen observer and critic of modernity.

Basically modern people have _bad faith_ about history. Everything is explained away as dark superstition or vicious oppression. I have realized we can learn  a lot by simply giving the past the benefit of doubt and ask questions like, could there be any social benefit of an aristocracy?

And thus this is one of the ideas I am toying with. If you want a good race horse, you will make sure to breed it well, from the best parents, and give the best upbrining from birth? So why not the same for human leaders?  Note that in the year 1800 this would not have sounded ridiculous at all! But we modern people tend to abandon such ideas of the past without really carefully checking them.

So today why do we have social institutions for electing and selecting leaders but no modern institutions for bringing up leaders from an infant age trained for the job? All that exists is the remnants of old aristocratic institutions like some exclusive private schools.  Wouldn't it make sense? 

We train Olympic gymnasts for that career from the age of 5. Yet we expect a leader will just self-select in some college club or something a 19. Does it make sense to you?

We've also refused the US extradition before, Bobby Fischer for example.

Edit: I think I should clarify my point, what I wanted to say was just ""What are the Amercians going to do?"". Are they going to pull out of Iceland? Already did, 7 years ago. Will they stop patroling Iceland? Europeans already do most of the patrols. Will they refuse to protect Iceland in the event of an attack? That would be an absurd violation of the NATO treaty. Will they insist that Iceland be kicked out of NATO, for harboring a wistleblower that revealed that US was spying on many of its NATO allies? I don't see that happening.

Will they insist that NATO operations in Iceland shut down, with the polar cap melting and China and Russia both looking flirtatiously at Iceland, and other NATO nations with interests in the region?

2) 
&gt;Average university rankings for private institutions are pretty bad, especially given that many are highly specialized.

Your claim, without any source again.

3) 

Your cited article from ""Die Welt"" argues that many private universities in Germany are more like Community-Collages in the US, and do a training for the Job. They are not aiming for research, they are aiming for training people to work in the industry. So if any ranking includes ""research"", they fail of course. Research is almost completely unimportant in university teaching (it becomes important if you want to get higher degrees, but not at bachelor, master or diplom levels).

Compare a Porsche to a MB Actros Truck - they both have between 400 and 600ps, but if acceleration and driving characteristics are included in the ranking, the porsche will win. If you include transportation capacity, the Actros will win. These private universities should be compared to maybe Fachhochschulen, not universities. 

4) 

While private universities might (!!!) be easier to obtain certain degrees I do not believe they hand out degrees nilly-willy.

You might come out slightly cheaper if you're smart about booking tickets, but then you'll be bound to specific trains. With the D-Pass you can just get on any train and go. For a tourist that seems like a great decrease in stress.

You won't have to bother having discussions with the trainstaff because your ticket is only valid for IC not ICE or only the train one hour earlier.
You can also be spontaneous. Mabye go out into the Alps from Munich or something.

The only thing that you can not use the Pass on is Sleeper Trains sadly. Used to be possible up until 2 years ago but not anymore. This only applies to special night trains though (CNL), not ICE or IC trains that go in the night.

Edit: another alternative would be the [eurail pass](http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes/regional-pass/germany-poland). You'd probably want the one that allows for ten days of travel within 2 months. They seem to only have them for germany + any one of the neighbouring countries and they are between 360 and 390€. So more expensive then the D-Pass and less days.

When you are visiting Nuremberg, i strongly recommend visiting at least Bamberg, too. It's a nice small town 60km north of Nuremberg and really worth a visit. I added my little ""guide"" to that region:

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.

* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.

* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)

* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.

* [Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!

* In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.

* Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 

* [Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.

* [Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.

* [Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 

* [Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing

* In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!

* Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

* ADIDAS and PUMA have their headquarters and big outlet shopping centres in the small town of Herzogenaurach, 25km north-west of Nuremberg. If you want to go shopping for cheap sportswear (and more), you should consider a visit. Also if you are interested in [modern](http://www.vb.com/puma/puma-hq-herzogenaurach-m.jpg) [architecture](http://www.herzogenaurach.de/typo3temp/pics/e9cc906d7d.jpg).

**Bamberg:**

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  

* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.

* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the [""Alte Hofhaltung""](http://www.emiksch.de/Lions/2007/Bilder/slides/Bamberg_Alte_Hofhaltung.jpg) where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)

* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""

* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above

* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.

* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.

* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.spezial-keller.de/index_files/stacks_image_44.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.

* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.

* Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

* Bamberg is a University Town with currently about 12k Students (at 70k people), so you'll find young people everywhere.

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recommend ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**

* [Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here

* [Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)

* Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

* The University of Würzburg has about 25k students enrolled, the city if full of them ;)

**Bayreuth:** 

* [The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)

* [The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

* Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live (0,5 litre of beer: beginning at 1,50€), and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car, but there are is a list of [bus lines](http://vgn.de/freizeitlinien/) (german link) that are esp. for recreational/free time destinations like wildlife parks or hiking from may 1st till november. Click ""herunterladen (PDF)"" to download a pdf with a map and images to see what to expect and maybe use google translate (google translate did not work on the homepage when I tried it, so i recommend the pdf ""workaround""). Here is a [map of the region with public transport lines](http://www.vgn.de/ib/site/documents/media/f387bb36-6624-65dd-c17b-5cde6c7b84f4.jpg/VG_Freizeit_Prospekt.jpg) that are interesting for tourists, green are regular routes, purple routes are weekend and holiday only and only in the summer while orange are weekend only during the whole year. If you need help to find the right trip, message me and I'll translate and help you to find the busses etc.

* [Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremberg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle (well, actually two castles) there and live there. 

* [Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.

* The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.

* At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.


**Traditional Food** you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

**Breweries I would recommend, although all are great:**

* Brauerei Wagner in Merkendorf
* Brauerei Goldener Löwe in Buttenheim (where the Levi Strauss museum is)
* Schlenkerla in Bamberg (The Rauchbier - that means Smoked beer- is a famous speciality, tastes like bacon) 
* Fässla in Bamberg
* Grasser in Huppendorf
* Klosterbrauerei in Weissenohe (founded 1050, one of the oldest breweries in germany, great food also!)

(Typical beer types in the region are ""helles"" and ""dunkles"", but also ""Märzen"" or ""Bockbier"") 

**Some Festivals in the Region:**

* [Sandkirchweih Bamberg](http://www.sandkerwa.de/startseite/) 22.-26. August

The most densely populated areas of Turkey are considered Caucasian, by those who still care about race.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stoddard_race_map_1920.jpg

Similarly, color is a continuum just as well: 

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Huxley_whites.png

One wonders what you're going to do with the millions of non-white non-caucasian Europeans as well.

&gt;It's different though. Tomatoes are a product. A product is something nature gives you so you can't claim it's yours-it's just there. Same goes for rice. But they way the product is prepared is part of a certain culture. We can make rice, but the Chinese way of making rice is Chinese and it's part of their culture.

If the product doesn't matter but only the culture, why do you insist that non-white non-Caucasians can't be European?



&gt;Pasta as we know it is European. The Chinese used to(and still do) make pasta from rice. Italians make it from wheat. So wheat spaghetti is part of Italian culture(thus European) and rice spaghetti are part of Chinese culture.

I'll cite your own words: ""product is something nature gives you so you can't claim it's yours-it's just there. Same goes for rice."" So you can't invoke using a different product as an essential difference.

Le régime de Pétain signifiait, non pas la rupture avec l'histoire de la France, comme l'affirmait de Gaulle, mais la continuité directe. La preuve immédiate en est l'appareil d'Etat, qui fonctionna sans être démantelé, de la Troisième République à nos jours, en passant par Vichy et l'Occupation, la Quatrième République et la Cinquième République. René Bousquet, chef de police de Pétain et organisateur des grandes rafles de Juifs parisiens suivies de déportations en camps d'extermination, vécut très bien après la Libération. Il en fut de même de Maurice Papon, fonctionnaire loyal et organisateur de la déportation d'enfants et de familles juives sous Pétain, puis, en 1961, en tant que chef de police de Paris, responsable du massacre de centaines de manifestants indépendantistes algériens pacifiques et sans armes.

Les anciens responsables de Vichy ont ultérieurement occupés d’importants postes tant sous les gouvernements de droite que de la ""gauche"" social-démocrate. Ces responsables comprenaient Papon et Bousquet, et en premier lieu le président François Mitterrand qui a dirigé le PS de 1971 jusqu’à sa mort en 1995 et qui fut un ami tant de l’un que de l’autre. Papon a servi en tant que haut responsable de la sécurité tandis que Bousquet a travaillé à la Banque d’Indochine, aidant à financer les politiciens de la social-démocratie française.

Nobody blames microsoft for selling them shit products, people buy apple or something better instead. The same is mostly true for education aswell. 

The thing is, not many schools run by the government has been shut down, they have just downsized and been forced to improve their schooling. 

Also the conclusion that many swedes likes this system and ""paradoxically"" is against venture capitalists pocketing state money, isn't really paradoxically at all. Most people still send their children to state run schools and they realize the competition is good for the system.

Right now, we have a severe overcapacity in schools too, in the coming years when the groups of children entering school becomes smaller due to demographics it will be a severe crunch in this sector, its already beginning to happen (it surprises me that this article isnt mentioning it) and many schools will close, some even during terms.

Or le véritable scandale est avant, dans la masse de ceux que le système scolaire exclue, et là on s'aperçoit que ce sont principalement des garçons, des hommes. Les déscolarisés, des garçons, les illettrés, des garçons, les prisonniers, des garçons.

Pourquoi on parle de discrimination des femmes quand [les filles réussissent mieux leurs études,
quel que soit le niveau
d’enseignement et quelle que soit la filière ou discipline considérée. 68 %
d’une génération de filles possèdent le baccalauréat contre 56 % pour les
garçons. Les filles mènent des études plus longues. Elles sont plus souvent
diplômées du supérieur.](http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/docs_ffc/donsoc06i.pdf)

Par ailleurs, vers la fin de la vidéo, elles rejettent complètement toutes les différences physiques, avec pour seul argument la plasticité du cerveau.

C'est oublier que la dyslexie est 3 fois plus importante chez les garçons, l'autisme 4 fois plus important, et elles voudraient nous faire croire qu'à l'origine, ce sont des différences de d'éducation et de construction genrée ?

Bref, un gros déni de réalité, nos cerveaux sont différents car nous avons des corps différents. Nous ne sommes pas soumis aux mêmes cycles hormonaux, et les hormones ont une influence sur nos comportements. Nous n'avons pas les mêmes corps, et les corps ont une influence sur la représentation que nous avons du monde, et que le monde a de nous. Le fait que les différences entre individus soient plus importantes que les différences entre sexes n'implique pas qu'il n'y a pas de différences entre sexes.

Et dans le cas où elles croiraient vraiment à leur théorie, si elles s'intéressaient vraiment à l'égalité, elles devraient plutôt s'occuper de ceux du bas, des prolétaires.

* Abitur = the diploma that grants you the ability to attend a University
* Realschule = middle school / junior high school (usualy from class 5 - 10, after that you can to an apprenticeship or do the abitur)
* Berufsschule = vocational school (usually for the education for people that do an apprenticeship in technical areas(mechanic, electrician etc.)
* Berufliches Abitur = normal Abitur but you get a proper education in subjects you won't be taught on a Gymnasium (specialized, in medical, technical or economical areas) (for example I got a special education in IT, one of my Abitur exams was in IT on an elevated level which means the exam lasted 5hours)
* Fachoberschule = where you can graduate to study on a Fachhochschule, it doesn't allow you to study on an university
* Fachhochschule = almost like a Univiersity but with more practical stuff, universities are generally only Theoretical stuff
* Gymnasium = Senior High school (you graduate here with the Abitur) (usually from class 5 - 12, the classes importent for the Abitur are only the last two)

Could someone explain to Samaras where he should cut state workers. He tried closing down ERT (public television) and then Europe talked about oppression of the press.

He cut servises to the less fortunate as it was required by the bailout and then everybody looked surprised as Golden Dawn assumed the soup kitchens and help for home for the disabled that were closed. And in the end he had to spend more money finding new workers to replace the ones that it was required to fire because Golden Dawn was providing the public servises that were cut.

He cut military, police and coastline personel as he was asked to and then everybody said Greece why you don't guard your coastline adequate, why you don't have enough police force.

He also decreased the state workers in various state servises then everybody asked why your streets are so dirty why immigrants wait so long for asylum, why Greece doesn't have enough teachers etc.

Samaras so far did everything that he was asked to without asking questions the thing is who do you thing are the public workers and how easy is to cut their positions or spend money to retrain them to rearrange them in new ones?",0,1372771298,null,0,false,0,caugffg,t3_1hhkdg,t1_caugffg,t1_caufnd5,null,1430609736,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Il punto non è la cifra (100000 €, a cui se ne aggiungono altri 20000 offerti per alcuni restauri, sono comunque una bella cifra, ma una miseria se confrontata ad un bilancio comunale di oltre 600 milioni), il punto è che si è fatta passare l'immagine di una Firenze bottegaia che tiene più al quattrino che al proprio nome e al proprio prestigio. Niente di nuovo, per carità, ma era un'immagine che Renzie aveva detto di voler smentire. Invece, a quanto pare, per 36 milioni di euro all'anno, puoi comprarti il Ponte Vecchio. Se a ciò sommi la ridicola scusa del ""non potevamo dirlo perché sono VIP"", hai l'immagine di una amministrazione comunale pronta a calarsi le braghe per favori personali o per il soldo.

You think the reason why Snowden's not going to get asylum in any EU country is because every European country's politicians are simply spineless? Nonsense. Every politician in Europe know that this would be political dynamite if THEY could be the ones to ""bravely"" offer him a safe haven. But that's not all there is to it.

You can be assured that the NSA offered intelligence cooperation to most or all of our European allies in the EU, and that they gladly took it. Who here honestly thinks that their country's government (or intelligence service!) was totally, utterly unaware of the NSA's electronic surveillance program? Please. We now know that the British were involved as well. France, Germany, the Scandinavians, Spain, Italy - all have well-established and sophisticated intelligence services that **without a doubt** were in bed with this program.

So I imagine there are a lot of conversations happening now between political leaders in the EU and their intelligence agencies, in which the intel leaders are stressing that they cannot, under any circumstances, permit Snowden asylum. Doing so would not only be a slap in the face to an ally, whose intelligence they've been relying on, but would also be a much more grave legal betrayal.

1. Die NSA-Überwachung ist aus rein technischen Gründen sehr viel schlimmer als die Überwachung, zu der die Stasi in der Lage war. (http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/06/26/195045/memories-of-stasi-color-germans.html) Die alten Stasioffiziere bekommen feuchte Augen, wenn sie das sehen. Damals konnten sie nur 40 Anschlüssen gleichzeitig überwachen. mehr war einfach nicht möglich, für jeden neuen Überwachungsfall musste eine andere Überwachung abgebrochen werden. Die NSA überwacht Millionen parallel.

2. Die Überwachung durch die Stasi - so schlimm sie auch war - war vollkommen legal. Die SED konnte sich einfach Gesetze machen, die das erlaubt haben. Das ist ein Grund, den Prism-Verteidiger gerne anbringen: ""Es ist ja nicht gegen das Gesetz"". Falsch (Im Sinne von ""unmoralisch"") ist es trotzdem, aus den gleichen Gründen, aus denen die Stasi-Überwachung falsch war.

3. Die Stasi-Überwachung war ein rein innenpolitisches Problem. Im Prinzip kann eine Regierung mit ihrem Volk machen, was sie will. Es ist ein souveräner Staat und prinzipiell sollte niemand das Recht haben, sich da einzumischen. Es gibt sehr gute, z.B. humanitäre Gründe, die Souveränität zu verletzen, aber keinen, einfach mal auf der Souveränität aller anderen Staaten rumzutrampeln, die die USA das hier gemacht haben. Auch wenn der Bundespräsident nur ein Grüßaugust ist, hat er rein formal den höchsten Posten im Staat. Er sollte wenigstens zeigen, daß ihm die Souveränität unseres Landes irgendwas bedeutet.

Er sollte dabei doch ein bißchen was gelernt haben.

Have you talked to any linguists about this kind of stuff?  I recommend you read the ""ethics"" sections in various field manuals (Crowley 2005; Bowern 2008; Rice [President of the LSA!] in Thieberger 2012).  Alternatively, you might prefer sources dedicated to sociolinguistic work rather than documentation work.  I'm sure if you PM'd /u/hatcheck or /u/lafayette0508 they could give you some good stuff.

No hypocrisy here. I don't think Europe has lectured China about the hacking very much. Certainly not the UK, which is pretty much the top spy on the planet and people kind of generally accept that. Notice the lack of hypocrisy in this too: while the Germans, Nordics, Eastern Europeans etc are generally disapproving of this, there are some very pointedly silent countries in Europe - UK and France being the top ones, but I haven't seen much from Swedes either.

I don't have anything against spying, though there should be limits to how much you spy on your friends (if I was American I wouldn't be super happy to hear that, say, France had most US senators homes full of cameras up to and including their bedrooms... how is that a friendly act?)

&gt; I don't know why being anti-Israel or anti-torture or anti-RIAA would compel us to spy on you. 

Because these things typically come down to individuals. You pick up and bully individual people who feel in a certain way. Think of it as the equivalent of meddling in US politics by fishing up suspicious material on say, Elizabeth Warren (or Rand Paul for that matter).

My worry is that the US might be doing in EU what you worry the US might do to itself. Sure, you can just listen to what's going on in congress/senate, but to make a difference you start influencing votes and elections by targeting individuals etc.

Non so fino a che punto sia una battuta, quindi te lo chiedo lo stesso: ma non penserai davvero che tutti quelli che credono in Dio se lo immaginino come un essere personale (cioè antropomorfo e tutto il resto)? Non crederai sul serio che chiunque creda in Dio sia un creazionista e neghi le scoperte scientifiche?

Sin praticamente dagli inizi, la teologia cristiana (e la speculazione ebraica dopo) ha fatto suo il Motore immobile aristotelico e/o il Dio platonico, in ogni caso l'Essere supremo dei filosofi greci, non c'è stato spazio per vecchi albini volanti.

Per quanto mi riguarda, quella è un'iconografia derivata dal Dio Padre Zeus (ma divaghiamo), in ogni caso è una rappresentazione. Se leggi i testi filosofici e/o teologici, non troverai un'idea simile di un Dio antropomorfo, anzi per secoli si sono sforzati di interpretare in senso allegorico i riferimenti all'antropomorfismo divino.

&gt;Anzi, andando a vedere bene era quasi inevitabile, date le premesse, il tempo necessario e tutto il resto, che emergesse la vita.

Prima ancora della vita: era quasi inevitabile che dal nulla ci fosse qualcosa? Il Big Bang era inevitabile? E *perché* l'universo è fatto in modo tale affinché fosse quasi inevitabile il nascere della vita?

Lungi da me il voler convincere alcuno, però il succo del mio discorso è che sinceramente non trovo più razionale il non credere rispetto al credere, né comunque vedo contraddizione fra il credere in un Essere supremo e il non credere a tutto ciò che dicono gli uomini, comunque si vestano e si sentano autorizzati a parlarne.

Le féminisme s'intéressent aux femmes, soit la moitié de la population. 

Il existe différents mouvements avec des idées et des revendications sensiblement différentes mais l'idée générale est de combattre les inégalités sous toutes leurs formes. Critiquer l'action de certain(e)s en disant qu'elle ne concerne qu'une minorité c'est un peu fort: dans ce cas on ne s'intéresse pas au plafond de verre? Alors on n'est pas prêts d'avancer dans la parité aux postes les plus avancés dans les entreprises ou en politique, qui aurait des répercussions sur les ""masses prolétaires"" évidemment.


&gt;Or le véritable scandale est avant, dans la masse de ceux que le système scolaire exclue, et là on s'aperçoit que ce sont principalement des garçons, des hommes. Les déscolarisés, des garçons, les illettrés, des garçons, les prisonniers, des garçons.

L'un n'empêche pas l'autre. Les féministes ne nient pas ces faits, au contraire. Elles cherchent à démontrer que les inégalités salariales ou d'accès à l'emploi etc sont d'autant plus choquantes que les filles réussissent mieux leur scolarité. Mais leur sensibilisation aux stéréotypes de genres ne s'adresse pas qu'aux femmes, on doit chercher des moyens de lutter contre toutes les formes de ségrégation. (Si les stéréotypes poussent les filles à être plus sérieuses, dociles, calmes ce qui est profitable pour leur réussite scolaire... évidemment que de l'autre côté le conditionnement des garçons à être agités ou violents est extrêmement préjudiciable).


&gt;Pourquoi on parle de discrimination des femmes quand les filles réussissent mieux leurs études, quel que soit le niveau d’enseignement et quelle que soit la filière ou discipline considérée. 68 % d’une génération de filles possèdent le baccalauréat contre 56 % pour les garçons. Les filles mènent des études plus longues. Elles sont plus souvent diplômées du supérieur.


Parce qu'elles ont pourtant un salaire 27% inférieur à celui des hommes, 1/3 d'entre elles travaillent à temps partiel (le plus souvent subi) et plus on avance dans la hiérarchie, dans tous les secteurs, moins il y a de femmes.


&gt;Par ailleurs, vers la fin de la vidéo, elles rejettent complètement toutes les différences physiques, avec pour seul argument la plasticité du cerveau.

Avancer un argument ne signifie pas rejeter les autres. Elles parlent de choses différentes: la plasticité du cerveau comme une explication du rôle de l'environnement et de l'éducation sur nos capacités ne signifie pas qu'il n'existe pas des différences entre les sexes à mon sens. ou comme tu le dis:

&gt;Le fait que les différences entre individus soient plus importantes que les différences entre sexes n'implique pas qu'il n'y a pas de différences entre sexes.

Je ne crois pas qu'elles affirment l'inverse.

Quando assisto a dibattiti credenti vs. atei, spesso anch'io, come peste70, vedo in alcuni atei (meglio: anticlericali) la stessa testardaggine dei credenti più ottusi. Lo stesso attaccamento ai testi (anche se diversi) e la stessa voglia di *credere* più che di capire.

Per quanto le credenze siano opposte e questo li faccia sembrare diversi in apparenza, li fa in realtà somigliare tanto, anche nella voglia di **imporre** la propria visione sugli altri, invece di vivere e lasciar vivere.

La differenza sta forse nel fatto che un gruppo si ritiene più buono, mentre l'altro più intelligente, in ogni caso la somiglianza è nella mancanza di dialogo serio, e nell'atteggiamento di superiorità sottinteso di uno sull'altro.

Ovviamente ho generalizzato parecchio, ma è una tendenza che ho notato più volte, il che ovviamente non vuol dire *sempre*, né *in tutti*.

&gt;Al di là della polemica, scoprire che ciò che si dice di Gesù contiene clamorose sovrapposizioni con divinità/profeti di culture antecedenti (culto di Mitra o di Dioniso per citarne solo due) non provoca nessun tipo di reazione in un credente?

Anche quando ero übercredente+praticante la cosa non mi ha mai creato alcun problema. Avrei inoltre risposto che una somiglianza non implica la falsità del messaggio cristiano. 

D'altronde le differenze sono così tante, ed in numero così maggiore rispetto alle analogie, che queste ultime possono tranquillamente passare come coincidenze.

Anche studiando criticamente la storia delle religioni per anni, la conclusione è la stessa: le eventuali influenze dirette sono ancora tutte da dimostrare e quindi, scientificamente, è come se non ci fossero, fino a prova contraria.

Inoltre, anche se queste prove si dovessero un giorno trovare, i passaggi:

* c'è una somiglianza fra A e B =&gt; c'è un'influenza di A su B

* A ha influenzato B =&gt; B è tutta una montatura

Le féminisme est censé s'intéresser aux inégalités. Tu le dis toi-même :

&gt;l'idée générale est de combattre les inégalités sous toutes leurs formes

Or ici, dans ces conférences, il ne s'intéresse qu'aux inégalités qui touchent les bourgeoises. Et c'est souvent le cas : au lieu de critiquer l'absence de prolétaires chez les élus, elles critiquent la difficulté qu'ont les bourgeoises à se faire élire. C'est un manipulation de bourgeoises qui nient la lutte des classes.

&gt;Critiquer l'action de certain(e)s en disant qu'elle ne concerne qu'une minorité c'est un peu fort

Tu oublies le point important de mes propos : elle ne concerne qu'une minorité **de privilégiées**.

&gt;dans ce cas on ne s'intéresse pas au plafond de verre?

On s'intéresse au plafond de verre au détriment du prolétariat. Combat de bourgeoises encore une fois. Personne ne me convaincra que les inégalités chez les cadres supérieurs et chercheurs ne sont pas négligeables face aux inégalités entre classes.

Elles utilisent les rôles sociaux genrés comme seule explication des inégalités et réfutent l'influence de la testostérone sur la réussite par exemple.

&gt;Parce qu'elles ont pourtant un salaire 27% inférieur à celui des hommes, 1/3 d'entre elles travaillent à temps partiel (le plus souvent subi) et plus on avance dans la hiérarchie, dans tous les secteurs, moins il y a de femmes.

Les chiffres que tu cites sur les inégalités de salaires sont des moyennes trompeuses. C'est exactement ce que Vidal dénonce dans ses études : les différences inexpliquées à l'intérieur du même sexe sont plus importantes qu'entre sexes.

La [zone grise de différence salariale entre hommes et femmes est d'environ 10%](http://inegalites-hommes-femmes-entreprise.blogspot.fr/). Or, toutes choses égales par ailleurs, les différences de salaires au sein du même sexe sont de l'ordre de 15%. Si on élimine les CSP++, l'écart entre sexes se réduit à 6% contre 8% de différences entres individus du même sexe.

Bref, c'est encore une revendication de bourgeoises.

&gt;Pourtant tu sembles faire ce que tu leur reproche: mettre l'accent sur un aspect en particulier: les hormones, pour nier la réalité d'autres facteurs

So che non volevi generalizzare ma vista anche la risposta di OP preciso ugualmente che non volevo imporre nessuna visione, perché non ho una tesi da dimostrare (né potrei ragionevolmente). Parlavo di dubbi dovuti alle differenze tra fede e storiografia (anche sui martiri, su Costantino, ecc.), non di chissà che certezze.

&gt; Avrei inoltre risposto che una somiglianza non implica la falsità del messaggio cristiano.

E chi dice il contrario? Ma non ho bisogno di credere in trinità (del resto assente nei vangeli), risurrezione e transustanziazione per accogliere il messaggio cristiano.

&gt; Anche studiando criticamente la storia delle religioni per anni, la conclusione è la stessa: le eventuali influenze dirette sono ancora tutte da dimostrare e quindi, scientificamente, è come se non ci fossero, fino a prova contraria.

Per me questo è quasi negazionismo. Ed è opinabile perché giri attorno alla definizione di influenza diretta, ma purtroppo non ho le competenze né le fonti sotto mano per ribattere nello specifico.

11 273.4 M€ contribution, of which 6 570 M€ is spent on UK , for a 4 703.4 M€ net contribution, with a budget being 129 394.9 M€. 

In other words, UK's net contribution is 3.66% of the EU budget.

So it would be a negligible in comparison to the more difficult matter of actually being able to use the allocated cohesion funds. 

Which can vary from bit over 70% in case of estonia, to being just 26.2% in case of bulgaria. 

Either way, even in estonia's case, that's a far greater margin to optimize for, than the rounding error that's 3.66%

Some of that worked land has to be unused to avoid the agricultural produce mountains of the past,  but given that food security is one of the reasons for it then its unsurprising. The EU wants a certain level of agricultural production within Europe, is it better that this is done by efficient large scale farming which would cost less on average, or small scale farming which would cost more? you have to be rich to have large scale farms, no shit, and ultimately at least a solid chunk of this is ultimately used as expenses in the maintenance and operation of the farm. As far as subsidisation goes, it's a great deal better than when they were paying it based on production, which meant not only greater land degradation and environmental problems, but the butter mountains and wine lakes of the past.

Given the policy seeks to ensure a certain level of production, the trick is reforming to the minimal benefit possible to those that seek to take advantage of it, yet without discriminating specifically against them.

For a one sided test, you can reject the null hypothesis at a significance level alpha if the sum of B(i) from i = 0, ..., k is less than alpha. For k = 0, as in the case of the unfortunate school, this reduces to B(0) = 10^(-27), so you can reject the null at that significance level, indicating that the probability of 0 successes given p = .9 is 10^(-27) or pretty much 0%. 

For reference, as I mentioned above, if k = 21, then the sum of B(i) from i = 0 to 21 is .047057, indicating that even if 21 students had failed, the probability that their actual probability was less than 90% is still 95.2943%.",0,1372780320,null,0,false,0,caujayp,t3_1hfqbs,t1_caujayp,t1_caufptk,null,1430608379,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

People are complaining about the 1k lay offs in the public broadcaster. Or suppose  that this is a slightly less black and white issue, complaining about firing employees from the greek parliament.

true,FrankOBall,tourist,,"&gt;So che non volevi generalizzare ma vista anche la risposta di OP preciso ugualmente che non volevo imporre nessuna visione, perché non ho una tesi da dimostrare (né potrei ragionevolmente). Parlavo di dubbi dovuti alle differenze tra fede e storiografia (anche sui martiri, su Costantino, ecc.), non di chissà che certezze.

Ok, premetto che niente di quello che ho scritto era rivolto in maniera personale a te, nel senso che non ho pensato, né volevo implicare, che volessi imporre la tua visione, che è un atteggiamento che ho trovato spesso, ma non in questo thread.

&gt;&gt;Anche studiando criticamente la storia delle religioni per anni, la conclusione è la stessa: le eventuali influenze dirette sono ancora tutte da dimostrare e quindi, scientificamente, è come se non ci fossero, fino a prova contraria.

&gt;Per me questo è quasi negazionismo.

È il metodo scientifico. Se uno sostiene che qualcosa esiste, sta a lui l'onere della prova. Per quanto anche secondo me questo sconfini troppo facilmente nel negazionismo (ho avuto diversi dibattiti qua su reddit riguardo fenomeni paranormali, reincarnazione, ecc., e tutti finiscono inevitabilmente nel ""eh ma devi dimostrarlo se no è come se non ci fosse""), se queste sono le regole, bene, le accetto, ma allora devono valere sempre (ripeto, parlo in generale, non ce l'ho con te in particolare).

C'è di buono che dimostrare le proprie affermazioni è l'antidoto numero uno contro le bufale, che ci sono sia da parte dei credenti sia da parte atea/critica/miscredente. Tipo quel film Zeitgeist dice una valanga di emerite stronzate (e scusa se ho detto ""emerite"" ma mi è scappato), e quello ""trova"" un sacco di paralleli fra Gesù, Osiride, Mithra, ecc. Peccato che molte di quelle sconcertanti rivelazioni siano inventate di sana pianta (tipo Osiride crocifisso!).

&gt;Ed è opinabile perché giri attorno alla definizione di influenza diretta, ma purtroppo non ho le competenze né le fonti sotto mano per ribattere nello specifico.

Se qualcuno che abbia letto il testo citato (""Storia criminale del cristianesimo"", che a giudicare dal titolo comunque non mi pare uno studio tanto imparziale) trovasse e citasse i punti in cui l'autore *dimostri* che ci sia stato un contatto diretto fra i culti precedenti ed il cristianesimo (es. un ex sacerdote di Bacco che diventa un teologo cristiano, o una preghiera cristiana che è presa pari pari da una a Mithra), allora possiamo riprendere il discorso.

Quindi, usando un metodo scientifico, il tutto resta finora nel campo dell'indimostrato e del ""in linea puramente teorica non è impossibile"", che non è affatto: ""è andata certamente così"". Ovviamente, fino a prova contraria, in tal caso sarebbe molto interessante scoprire le influenze pagane sul cristianesimo. In ogni caso, è un dato di fatto che nessuna religione nasce completamente isolata ed è completamente originale, semplicemente non è mai accaduto nella storia, che io sappia.

Pur non essendomi occupato nello specifico, comunque, leggendo i Vangeli, le matrici ebraica ed ellenistica sono evidenti oltre ogni ragionevole dubbio, e non vedo necessaria l'introduzione nel modello di influenze greche più antiche, magari di culti che all'epoca erano già estinti (presumo) o comunque poco praticati e che in ogni caso immagino non siano stati accolti tanto apertamente a Gerusalemme, per usare un eufemismo. L'idea di resurrezione della carne era già largamente presente nell'ebraismo (es. Ezechiele); non vedo perché scomodare antichi culti greci probabilmente sconosciuti in una Palestina dove la resistenza ai pagani ed ai loro culti era decisamente violenta (vedi la rivolta dei Maccabei, degli Zeloti, di Bar Kokhba, ecc.).

Per non parlare dei cristiani, col loro distinguersi sin da subito dai pagani per la loro morigeratezza di costumi: trovo estremamente improbabile che per le loro dottrine si siano rifatti ai culti di Dioniso, per dirne una. E comunque, ribadisco, che le differenze sono così tante rispetto alle poche somiglianze, che queste ultime perdono di rilevanza.

**Riassumendo**: non per negazionismo, ma per semplice prudenza e metodo scientifico è giusto che le affermazioni richiedano dimostrazioni, soprattutto quando delle spiegazioni più ""economiche"" ci sono già.",0,1372782396,null,0,false,0,cauk2o7,t3_1hg1ra,t1_cauk2o7,t1_cauiedq,null,1430608019,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

Too late? Anyway, I'm not consistently disagreed with. Only when I step out of line and become an ""uncle Tom"" against you great saviors do I generally get disagreed with. As for supporters I think you'll find that there are way more linguists of all different fields on /r/srssucks and /r/TumblrInAction than you'd care to acknowledge, but then that's what it's all about isn't it? Because I'm not a part of your racist, sexist circlejerk that is srs and related subs, it's not about my methods or the science of it, the fact that they're claiming that Serbian and Croatian have nothing to do with each other rather than acknowledging that they're related at least, it's the fact that I won't go along with the identity based circlejerk. 

I'm not going to caps lock because he who is loudest is not necessarily right, all I'm going to say is identity and feelings do not determine truth, truth is something that is grasped collectively through observation and testing.

We'd meet up at a friend's apartment (one of the students who didn't opt for a homestay) and pre-game a little before going out. Then we'd pick a destination and head out to the bars. For the first few weeks we frequented Café Oz and Hideout, but those got old after a while.

As the program went on, I got more accustomed to heading out on my own. I'd go into a bar, get a drink, and start talking to people. Really helped improve my French and had me feeling like one of the locals.

Of course, I always had to make sure I was back on the metro before it stopped running for the night.

true,Djmedic,null,null,"Le plus intéressant, et ce que ne rapporte pas cet article basé sur les statistiques Eurostat (organe chargé des statistiques dans l'Union européenne), c'est que le taux de chômage en zone euro est passé de 12,1% à 12,2% par rapport à avril 2013, mais **qu'il est resté stable dans l'Union européenne à 27** ([source Eurostat](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-01072013-BP/FR/3-01072013-BP-FR.PDF)), ce qui veut nécessairement dire que le chômage baisse dans les pays de l'Union qui n'utilisent pas l'euro.

Autre point intéressant :
&gt;*le nombre de chômeurs a augmenté de 15 000 dans l’UE27 et de 67 000 dans la zone euro.*

Si on soustrait l'augmentation du nombre de chômeurs dans la zone euro à l'augmentation du nombre de chômeurs dans l'UE, on obtient l'augmentation du nombre de chômeurs parmi les 10 pays de l'UE n'utilisant pas l'euro, ce qui nous donne :

Union Européene(27)  - Zone Euro(17) = Zone Hors Euro(10)

15 000 - 67 000 = - 52 000

Soit une ""augmentation"" négative...ce qui veut dire que le nombre de chômeurs a baissé de 52 000 parmi les pays ayant conservé leur monnaie nationale.

Même raisonnement pour le chômage des jeunes :

&gt;*le nombre de jeunes chômeurs a diminué de 53 000 dans l’UE27 et a augmenté de 84 000 dans la zone euro*

UE27 - ZE17 = ZHE10

53 000 - 84 000 = - 31 000

Le nombre de jeunes chômeurs parmi les 10 pays de l'UE n'utilisant pas l'euro a diminué de 31 000.

Ca n'est certes pas énorme, mais il faut remettre ça dans un contexte où l'UE est à son 25ème mois de hausse consécutive du chômage.

Le fait qu'Eurostat, l'organe qui s'occupe des statistiques en Europe (et qui dépend de la Commission européenne) ne prenne qu'en compte que  deux groupes (UE27 et ZE17) lui permet d'éviter de montrer que l'euro est néfaste, ce qui est bien curieux pour une organisation qui est fière de sa prétendue objectivité.

[On peut le voir en observant l'évolution de la différence du taux de chômage entre l'UE et la zone euro](http://www.upr.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/chomage_france_asselineau-600x287.jpg) :

+ Au début de l'introduction de l'euro, le taux de chômage était moindre en zone euro, et 1 euro valait 1 dollar,

+ Le taux de chômage monte progressivement en zone euro au fur et a mesure que  l'euro s'apprécie par rapport au dollar (1 euro vaudra jusqu'à 1 dollar 60),

+ Depuis 2011, les politiques récessives imposées par Bruxelles enfoncent le clou, le problème de taux de change qui reste relativement élevé (1 euro = 1 dollar 30 actuellement) n'étant que la cerise sur le gâteau

Which was the whole point. There's no such thing as ""total war scenario"". That's what I mean with a ""video game war"". If you look at the world through movies and video games, then yes, the US can ""devastate any nation on earth"" and UK can send 5% of their army to rape, pillage and burn all of Iceland. If you look at economic, political and diplomatic reality it's not going to happen.

The US are only barely getting away with invading brown peoples dictatorships and even then it's stretching it very thin economically and politically. If they tried anything against people who wear jeans, listen to the same music as them and can quote the same movies they watch in decent english it would be political suicide.

Which brings us neatly back to the cod wars. Maybe it wasn't a real war. And yes, the british navy could have sunk every coast guard boat from Iceland. But doing that would be political suicide for any officer and politician involved. So it didn't happen. So the Icelanders won.

Christ you're so fucking paranoid.  I post on an SRS-related sub maybe once or twice a week and neither /u/hatcheck or /u/lafayette0508 are SRSers at all (I just mention them because they have sociolinguistics flairs).  And the former called you ""the worst sociolinguist [she's] ever seen"".

I don't think you know what postmodernism is.  I am not a postmodernist.  I don't even like postmodernism.  I made two points.  The first is that presenting yourself as a linguist and telling native speakers what they should call their language is going to foster distrust and dislike of linguists and linguistic research *regardless of whether or not you think it's true* is an inarguable fact.  The second is that identifying ""languages"" from other types of speech variety is a murky issue anyway without a single diagnostic criteria and that one of the diagnostic criteria used *is* sociopolitical identity.

Premièrement ; la photo est effectivement utilisée depuis 30 ans. Le photographe en question ne s'attaque donc pas légitimement aux Restau du coeur, puisque s'il s'agissait de faire respecter réellement ses droits d'auteurs, il aurait pu le faire il y a 30 ans. Au delà de ça, si la prescription prend effet trois ans après la fin du délit dans le cas des délits de contrefaçon, elle perdure le temps que dure le délit si celui-ci est continu. 
Le photographe est donc, légalement, dans son droit.

Moralement, c'est une ordure.

S'il avait effectivement besoin d'argent, il aurait pu lancer l'action il y a bien longtemps. Or, [On voit bien](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xmkqn5_clip-expo-gaston-bergeret-cabinet-d-amateur_creation#.UdM1F_lM9hN) que ça ne lui a pas vraiment posé de problème avant très récemment.

The far right can't contain itself, as has been seen in the violent protests against gay rights in the last few months, while these reforms would have passed without notice in a normal context. 

In the meantime, most of the left is amazingly angry that the victory of the last election led to flabby inaction in the face of vast inequality and egregious foreign interference against our sovereign rights. 

The regular right is ridden with corruption and clamoring for a return of the Great Corrupt One for some reason. 

None of the factions can stand each other, and each of the factions wishes to see the others die in a fire. Everyone knows that ""austerity"" is meant to further concentrate wealth into fewer and fewer hands, meaning that the entire fucking country opposes it, while the political elite caves into its industrialist friends' demands and enacts it anyway. Seeing the private sector prevail ahead of the state is making everyone even angrier somehow.

The price of housing has doubled in 10 years, and food prices are rising due to speculation. Wages have been stagnant for two decades. This won't end well.

If you add to this the tremendous amounts of dismissive bullshit from the anglosphere, that is obviously trying to undermine the country through retarded means (""Hurr, we paid a ratings agency to downgrade you!"", ""France is decaying herp derp!"", ""[Stupid stereotype about the French and their complete decline somehow]"") being repeated several times a week for months on end, we don't exactly take too kindly to this kind of article.

Personally I would support an additional way to replace a number of mayor signatures by citizen signatures (maybe with a quite high exchange rate to avoid too much trouble with smallish parties). But the FN proposes that the mayor signatures are anonymous, which I find unacceptable. An elected representative is supposed to represent his population; making his actions secret would remove that concept.

&gt;Dans le Gouvernement Chirac, l'alliance UDF-RPR, pour se débarrasser du boulet encombrant du FN incité par la gauche, s'empresse de rétablir un mode de scrutin majoritaire, accompagné d'un découpage électoral soigneusement établi par Charles Pasqua. Ce qui enlève tout espoir au FN d'accéder de nouveau à l'Assemblée National.

As for other countries granting asylum,  and the potential for future blowback (or precedent),  that can only be considered a good thing.  Whistleblowers like Snowden are a check in the system.

be no different with our governments.

In the 70's, Sweden was (at least according to my mother :-) ) very ""hippie like"" when it came to school, one should learn becaue it was fun, no grades (which the left and the green party who are speaking in the article btw still want to remove - we should all just learn out of joy or something) and it was ""unfair"" towards those who knew less etc. Sounds idiotic, and it probably was. Anyway, it was all state schools then btw. Sweden has this very socialistic ideal, that still a lot of people like, and it can be good in some way, but a hindrance in another. For example, it was only maybe 10 years ago when Sweden got their specialized math schools, for very gifted math students. The left (old communists) the social democrats and the greens have always been against it, since they call it ""elite schools"", and we do not want that, according to them.

To me it is madness, I do not understand why students aren't allowed to be good in math and receive special education in that, but then again, I am not a communist or a superleftie. 

You must also remember we had decades of social democrats, so when the Moderaterna governed in 1991-1994 they tried to privatise it so it would be more ""competitive"". Social democrats (the right in that party) agreed a bit and left it, but didn't really implement any changes as far as I know (nor do I really know how good/hasty) the idea was from the beginning. After that it seeems it has run a bit wild. To many options, that we brilliantly have combined with a crappy teachers education which has also lead to a fall in people wanting to be teachers, not enough high enough salaries etc. 

So, it can be fixed, I guess it would take 20 years or so, to really get up there, but of course it can be done. Don't really think the problem is private schools though, it is a combination of things.

Imagine a world, when your opinion is not the only thing that matter, and people *might* not agree with you 100 %. Then we need to look at what we can *evaluate*. 

But, since you are such an super expert, are we all going to listen to you, unknown Internet voice, and fix the school, exactly as you want. I can tell you one thing, you need to have sharper arguments, because you haven't exactly won me over with the super detailed ""what works works"" (I agree with you, and I can also add, what doesn't work, doesn't work, btw).

Incidentally, I happen to believe there are things that needs to be fixed as well in school. I however, prefer a clear and scientific approach - see perhaps what works in Finland and try to apply it here, higher salaries etc. I guess that is far to scientific for you, but I have a feeling the voters would listen more to me than to a guy who apparently hates science, evaluations and claims ""what works, works"".

Just because you evaluate and make models that lead to conclusions does not imply that it will transition as smoothly into reality in the real world. I don't know about you, but that's a common realisation among myself and people at my work who did at least 5 years of studies on university level. A lot of academic models are good for utopian environments and don't work in real life, right here and now.   




So let's just briefly look at the school system in Sweden. I think we can agree that a lot of todays problems were already present 20 years ago. Many of these problems have already had opportunity to be evaluated in numerous scientific and non scientific evaluations. Yet they still persist. Thus you can't go all ad Hominem introducing fallacies to discredit me, bringing in your personal feelings into a half assed comment made by me. Claiming I'm against science and what not just because you got emotional. When I imply that another scientific evaluation is a pure waste of tax money, when (even though I did not mention that then), there has been numerous evaluations before, yet so many old problems still exist.    




Thus am I proclaiming that I'm an expert people should only listen too, implying science is pure shit? No. I'm just by experience calling another scientific evaluation a waste of time and resources. It will identify a lot of already known problems, together with a few new ones. But what does that matter when we known of problems for let say 20 years and not a single fucking thing has been done successfully to get rid of them? 
  
  
I would predict that your wanted new scientific evaluation will after a brief moment of heated debates and outcries from politicians ( maybe a few new laws or changes in the current law and policies) lead to nothing. Ten years from now a lot of problems will still be around. Just like today.   
  
  
Instead of yet again evaluating and having theatrical political debates that in the end don't help to solve the problems. Let's just fix the old, already known, problems. Get the wheel turning. Real solutions.  
  
  
Once that has occurred, I'll gladly support new scientific evaluations.

&gt; Il comporte quatre branches :

&gt; * le droit de divulgation (art. L121-2 du CPI2) : le droit de communiquer l'œuvre au public est décidé par l'auteur seul, dans des conditions qu'il aura choisies. Cependant, cette prérogative s'épuise lors de son premier exercice ;
&gt; * le droit de paternité (art.L113-13) : l'auteur a droit au respect du lien de filiation entre lui et son œuvre ;
&gt; * le droit au respect de l'œuvre (art. 121-1 et 121-5 du CPI2) ;
&gt; * le droit de repentir (art. L121-4 du CPI2) : l'auteur peut retirer l'œuvre du circuit commercial, même après sa divulgation.

si tu lis bien le dernier point, le droit de repentir : il a le droit de demander à ce que son image ne soit plus utilisée. Si tu lis le troisième paragraphe de l'article de numérama :

I understand, or maybe I don't, but I do understand that it is hard in Greece, very hard. But are you angry with your parents who didn't pay the taxes and with the uncle in the public sector? Are you angry with the cousin who you know work in the ""black sector"" (don't know what you call it in English, the illegal one, which is rather big in Greece, from what I have understood, between 20-30 %). 

Frankly, when a country has such bad finances, and is as corrupt as Greece is it is not just ""the government"". It is a lot of other people too -but all  I hear is the government, the police etc - what about the lazy neighbour and corrupt uncle.

That said, I know that the Euro most certainly has contributed to the state Greece is in which seems very bad indeed (if it were depending on me, Greece should have left years ago, but the Greeks didn't want to, and I guess it is your choice). The Euro is a very badly designed currency indeed, which is making the Greek recovery that much harder.

 However, firing people from an overbloated sector doesn't seem that bad to me, it needed to be done ages ago, I actually think it was part of the first bailout.  One of your (many) problems is that 40 years of reforms are crammed into a few years. The alternative is to keep them, and that is not really a solution either, is it?

The problem probably is that austerity doesn't mean the same for everybody. I have been told that austerity is selling a public building by 5 million euros to some crony and signing an agreement with him to pay one million euros per year as rent to use the building. Does that balances the budget? You would find amazing all the bullshit that they call austerity.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;The problem probably is that austerity doesn't mean the same for everybody.

True, what south seems to call austerity is honestly balancing the budget for us. We've had surplus, but according to the south the is very austere. It honestly irritates me when someone calls a balanced budget for austere. It makes me think they are extremely irresponsible with money. No, a balanced budget is not austere, not at all. Then Sweden have lived with austerity almost every year since 1998 or something. 

So, if you call a balanced budget for austere, then someone, somewhere before you have overspent - a lot I assume. 


&gt; However, I think that we can agree in calling austerity to apply cuts to the budget, firing public servants, selling public resources, and giving bailouts to the banks. I think that It was the initial meaning.



Hmm - Sweden have had a lot of austerity then. It has done us good. Honestly, if one has stupid banks, overbloated public sectors and a budget deficit, one needs to do that. 

Are you saying that Greece should have a budget deficit, keep their public sector intact and keep all their public recourses? Why then. They have done this tactic for the last 40  years and it is disastrous, actually. It is not austerity to balance a budget, not really. 

However, I can understand that the Greeks want some deficit to keep up some spending (traditional economic stimulus) and I agree with that. I don't agree with inefficiency though, so they should still reform the public sector. Nevermind that they actually promised that in the first bailout. That irritates me to - why promise things that one does not do. I makes me distrust them. You can see it in the thread too - people are getting tired of them not doing what they said they would do. Honestly, Greece need to change that aspect of their culture or whatever it is. One underpromise and overdeliver, not the other way around. 


&gt;I am saying that the governments aren't going to fix the problems.

Who is then? The EU? It is not our responsibility to fix Greece, honestly. I am getting tired of everyone just blaming the government. Honestly, I asked this of the Greek, and he didn't answer. Why aren't they blaming the corrupt uncle? the parents who didn't pay enough taxes etc. You do not get to the level of corruptions and mismanagement without the population participating. Why not blame themselves. They were happy when they didn't have to pay taxes like us idiots up north and didn't exactly complain about the lack of estate registry etc. Early retirement was nice for uncle X and since the neighbours brother worked as a tax man, they always got a discount, both at home and in the business. 

And, the people have to stop *just* blaming the government, they have to deal with themselves too. Are they paying their taxes now? I mean, at the end of the day, the only one who can fix Greece is the Greeks. It is not the EU's responsibility.

Well, the problem is that whatever he would face back home would not be ""justice"".

Now I understand that your argument is that Snowden can only credibly make the point that the justice being served is not just, and the resulting punishment wrongful, if he actually submits to said 'justice' and punishment.

I'm not sure whether I understand the logic behind that argument though. By the same token, *anyone* seeking asylum and refugee status in another country fails your test. After all, you write that ""civil disobedience means that you break a law that is unjust and take the punishment the legal system administers, in order to prove that the punishment is not just"". By that standard, any Iranian protester who fled the country after 2009 instead of ""taking"" the unjust punishment the Iranian regime would deem to lay on them - torture and such - would be a mere ""rat"". One doesn't have to equate the Iranian regime and the Obama administration in order to see that there's something flawed about that logic. 

&gt;Without accepting the punishment, you're just breaking the law for no reason.

This makes no sense at all. The reason he broke the law remains the same: to make information about the surveillance and covert data gathering by US agencies public that he thought important for the public to know, even if it was illegal to do so. Whether he accepts or escapes an unjust punishment for that action does nothing to change the motivation behind his actions. 

I mean, think about it. Today, I have seen people cite the examples of Mandela and ML King as people who, unlike Snowden, had the ""balls"" to stay in the country and face the men who would try to put them in jail for their civil disobedience. But would Mandela suddenly no longer have been a hero but a ""rat"" if he had managed to escape South-Africa instead of rotting away on Robben Island?

true,almodozo,null,null,"&gt; So cutting public spending to cut taxes is removing money from the economy? Are you really this stupid?

Gratuitous insults aren't really going to impress anyone. Meanwhile, austerity means that public spending is being cut, not in order to afford tax cuts as you claim, but to pay back loans to international banks. (Hell, austerity has generally meant cutting spending *and* raising taxes, in order to do exactly that.) 

So yes, the money is being removed from the economy, and transferred to banks abroad - Goth's point was perfectly legit. Well, but that's only right, you could say: they were loans after all. Of course you have to pay them back. But the problem is that removing money from an already struggling economy only makes it constrict further, making more people unemployed and pushing down company profits (hence why even the business lobby wants an end to austerity) - which in turn lessens the revenues needed to keep paying back those loans - etc. So you get stuck in a vicious downward cycle.

Keynesian policy says the state *should* save money (and pay back loans etc) - when the economy is growing. To do so when the economy is already stagnating or even shrinking just means digging yourself even deeper into the hole. All in all, Goth made a reasonable point, and hurling insults wasn't really the appropriate response.

The main reason is the man himself, Paulo Portas.

The current government won't meet its agreements with troika later this year. 

There's no way they can go from a 1st trimester deficit of 10,6% to an annual deficit of 5,5% as agreed with the troika. And the troika has had it. Portas (and Gaspar, and Portas' party fellow Ministers) don't want to be around when the government has to do the unthinkable to the portuguese economy just to please the troika. The portuguese PM really believes in this fake austerity bullshit (Gaspar is just a coward who does believe in it too but would rather save his career away from the spotlight). Portas doesn't. Portas wants to save his political career, and he wants to keep it in the good spotlight.

true,etalasi,UNSA,United States of America,"I find that very ironic considering Stalin hated Esperanto. There's a big fat volume cataloguing how certain governments hated and persecuted Esperantists and [it got its name *The Dangerous Language* from a quote by Stalin about Esperanto](http://donh1.tempdomainname.com/efaq.html#oppose).

Beyond Stalin personally, I'll cite two paragraphs from [a review of the book](http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/Literaturo/Recenzoj/dangxera_lingvo.html):
&gt; 1) The USSR undertook, in the mid-twenties, a correspondence campaign, designed to convince Western workers of the superiority of life in the USSR, and ditto for Soviet workers. The campaign only incidentally used Esperanto; but because of the dearth of foreign languge capability among Russian workers, in the end Esperanto apparently became the major tool of communication in this campaign. It worked all too well; by 1930 Esperanto had developed into such a significant means of communication across the Soviet Union's borders that the government actually tried to end the campaign by channeling it into ""collective"" correspondence (letters would be written and received by -- and consored by -- committees). The attempt failed. By the mid-thirties, when international communication at the personal level had become an intolerable crime, the Esperantists were the chief culprits.

&gt;2) While Lenin encouraged the development of local ethnic cultures and languages -- going to the trouble of sending out linguists to find peoples who did not yet have a written language, and developing one for them -- Stalin, a Russified Georgian, took the position that a strong and industrialized USSR could be developed only along the Western model of a nation-state. This meant that the country must have only one language of common use. Lenin, and traditional Marxists, assumed that such a language would evolve organically in a Socialist society (they did not favor Esperanto, since its inventor had been infected with too many bourgeois ideas [pp. 328-341]); Stalin intended the language of common use to be Russian. But there appears to have developed a feeling, codified many years later in a statement by the Estonian linguist Kammari (p. 508), that Esperanto was at least a potential competitor to Russian, not only internationally, but within the Soviet Union itself. Such competition, of course, could not be tolerated. Lins points out that the ups and downs of the Soviet Esperanto movement match remarkably well with periods of lesser and greater coercion of national minorities by the central government.

A transaction in a restaurant with a credit card may cost 5 euros. Then this amount is deducted from the sum which the customer pays and that could be comperatively a lot. Nobody wants his profit reduced by big amounts  just because the customer pays so this leads to that some shops/restaurants won't provide this service especially smaller ones.

Da libero professionista, senza agevolazioni, avrei dovuto pagare circa il 27.5% di INPS (per una pensione che non avrei mai visto), una stima del 30% di IRPEF, più circa 3-4% di IRAP (che è evitabile se non si hanno dipendenti, ci sono stati dei precedenti e cause vinte, ma in caso di ispezione fiscale è la prima cosa a cui si attaccano) più l' addizionale regionale (credo intorno all' 1.5%). Questo sul fatturato ma, dato che io di spese praticamente non ne ho, finisce che avrei dovuto pagare questa percentuale quasi per intero. La commercialista mi parlò di circa il 60% a conti fatti.

Pagare il 60% di tasse in se e per se può non essere una cosa brutta - nel caso in cui 1) le tasse non le paga solo chi non può evitare, tra mafia compagnia delle opere e agganci in finanza vari e 2) mi vengono corrisposti dei servizi che giustificano il prelievo fiscale. In Italia non sono soddisfatte queste condizioni.

true,thatfool,EURO,European Union,"Why, though? It's just another word in a long list of words that we didn't come up with on our own. We previously already stole the noun from Latin (Votum), and voten is easier to say than votieren (the existing German form of the Latin verb) and less ambiguous than abstimmen. It's easy to see why people would use it.

The rejection of foreign words is perhaps the biggest single success of early 20th century German nationalism. Before that, we had a lot more words of French, and to a much lesser degree, English origin. Words like Bahnsteig (used to be Perron), Fahrkarte (Billet), Schaffner (Conducteur), Geldbeutel (Portemonnaie), Schlafanzug (Pyjama) are all examples of this. We also have many direct translations like Wolkenkratzer (skyscraper) instead of Hochhaus. Even so, nationalist language preservation efforts generally ignored foreign words that had been in use for long enough. Perhaps because people fail to realize that words such as Boot (boat) or Lotse (naut. pilot) are Anglicisms too, just centuries old ones (and English has since moved on and uses the French pilot instead of loadsman/lodesman).

What I'm trying to say is that Anglicisms or loan words from other languages are no new phenomenon; this is just something that happens naturally when languages don't develop in isolation. You dislike Voten now; but you can be certain that for any given word you use yourself, there has been someone at some point in the past who disliked that word for the exact same reasons.

Man hat die Möglichkeit 3 gleichzeitige Zugänge zu nutzen, bei mir z.b. einen für PC, einen fürs Tablet und einen nutzt nen Kumpel. PIA hat auch ne Android App um einfach eine VPN Verbindung zu erstellen. Auf irgendwelche Datenlimits bin ich nicht gestossen.

Le demandeur est obligé de prouver qu'il a réellement commis une action éthique que son état déclare illégal. La question de qu'est-ce qui est éthique est l'une des plus dures à résoudre dans le droit. Il n'y a guère quelque précédents des actes reconnus comme éthiques, et la plupart d'entre eux sont des cas où le demandeur a agi soit pour sauver des vies ou des droits humains (et pas n'importe quel droit humain, seulement ceux qui sont reconnu par la France, l'ONU ou l'UE) ou soit pour exposer un complot qui avait pour but de violer ces droits. Il y a très peu de chances qu'un tribunal français rompe ce précédent de ne reconnaître que les actions qui préservent les droits de l'homme comme éthique.

Ce que Snowden devra faire pour trouver asile en France, c'est prouver que ses actions avait pour but de préserver les droits des citoyens des États-Unis, ce qui est vivement contesté par le gouvernement et même par la justice américaine. Il est évidemment possible que la justice française déclare qu'il reconnaît le droit à la vie privée comme essentiel pour la survie de tout homme, mais ça sera une étape *radicale*.

Bref, la France n'accordera pas l'asile politique à Snowden pas seulement parce qu'elle veut pas pourrir ses relations avec les US, mais aussi parce que légalement, il n'est pas du tout clair que Snowden n'est pas qu'un criminel. Pour lui, c'est déjà trop tard, il passera ses jours dans un coin d'Amérique du Sud, en Chine, ou dan une prison américaine. Le vrai débat qu'on doit démarrer, c'est qu'est-ce que c'est que l'importance de la vie privée ? Est-ce que l’État doit la reconnaître comme un droit humain fondamental ?

I slightly disagree with you. 

* People want changes in the elections code and a switch to [majoritarian system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majoritarian_representation) (I really don't know where this came from, and I oppose it). 
* We also want a change in the threshold that gets you into the parliament. At the moment this is 4%. People hope that decreasing it will bring more diversity in the parliament and give smaller parties a chance.
* Decrease of the number of MPs, which at the moment is 240.
* Decrease/eliminate the state subsidy for parties which have received more than 1% of the votes, or at least increase the minimum votes barrier for the subsidy ([here](http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=150345) it's more or less explained how it works now). At the moment [we spent 19 million Euros/year](http://www.mediapool.bg/%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B0%D1%82-%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B1%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B2%D1%8A%D0%BD%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B8-news207586.html) (article in BG) on state subsidies. I see that 2 weeks ago it was voted that only the parties in the parliament will get subsidies, so maybe we can take this off the list.. although this decision really serves only the parties in the parliament.
* And the most important one, I guess, is that people want some serious commitment towards transperancy in politics. We're not blind and we see how the mafia and the state have intertwined and formed a monstrous hybrid. We are a patient and naive nation, which is why it took us so long to stand up against the status quo. Unless something changes, people will keep protesting against every new old government, because we're indeed in the vicious circle /u/smokyexe described:

Why does it mean that?  You've got Scandinavian levels of public expenditure.  Are you getting Scandinavian levels of public service?  If not, why can the Scandinavians offer better services for the same cost as you are paying, whereas you can't?  For that matter, countries like the UK have much lower levels of public expenditure than you.  Are your services better than in Britain?  Seems like there's massive amounts of waste in the system.

Have you heard of the Pythagorean theorem? Much before the  Arabs even existed. The Romans had numbers. The Arabs had numbers as well. We chose Arab numbers because they are easier to write, and again out system is made by an European-Fibonacci. He added the 0 from India and the rest from the Arabs. That guy created it.

Racists never change their mind, I should have known that.

&gt;I do not know why you're saying the most densely populated-I mean it was only Istanbul and the West coast which are former Greek lands.

""only"" Istanbul which is one of the biggest cities in the world and a quarter of the Turkish population all by itself... And yes, including the west and north coast which are indeed people that are genetically indistinguishable from Greeks. So even by your questionable standards Turkey is a fine candidate.

&gt;If you noted I said indigenous Caucasian. Now I'm guessing you're not from an English speaking country(neither am I though) so it's okay but Turks aren't the indigenous population of Germany. Germans are. That's not the case in Turkey.

Germans aren't indigenous to Germany, they come from Southern Scandinavia. As a matter of fact, most Europeans today are descendants from farmers immigrating from the Middle East. And all people are descended from African hominids. By that reasoning, no state qualifies to join since they're all full of Africans.

&gt;Yeah but it's not exactly a copy.

Neither are European mosques or Chinese food served in Europe exact copies of Arabic mosques or Chinese food eaten in China. Therefore, they are European culture.

&gt;Oh really? Agriculture originated so long ago that we have absolutely no idea exactly where it started-might as well have been Europe. There is a general understanding that it was outside of Europe but no solid proof.

There is ample documentation showing gradual progression of agricultural practices - in particular grain agriculture that started with species native to the fertile crescent - originating in the Middle East and spreading slowly outward. (for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Centres_of_origin_and_spread_of_agriculture.svg)

&gt;We chose Arab numbers because they are easier to write,

That does not contradict that they are now part of our culture despite originating elsewhere. Arab numbers were not European culture before and now there are. Therefore, you can hardly claim that having a non-European culture is a problem for acceptance in Europe... since the definition of European culture is fluid and doesn't exclude elements originating from elsewhere either.

That tends to happen when you fail to be austere and rack up a massive debt.

&gt;So yes, the money is being removed from the economy, and transferred to banks abroad

Yeah, because people like Goth would vote for more public spending and not vote for higher taxes and hence the debt is passed on to the future generations which now have to pay for it.

&gt;But the problem is that removing money from an already struggling economy only makes it constrict further, making more people unemployed and pushing down company profits

It's money that shouldn't have been spent in the first place, it's the taxpayers who work and the state which spends their money for them, it's absolutely ridiculous.

&gt;Keynesian policy says the state should save money (and pay back loans etc) - when the economy is growing.

And our Keynesian policy makers deficit spent when the economy was growing and that didn't achieve much and now that it's contracting they can no longer continue doing that because of the already massive debt and constant credit restrictions.

&gt;To do so when the economy is already stagnating or even shrinking just means digging yourself even deeper into the hole.

You seem to think it would be possible to delay the austerity even further. We're already spending some ~5% of GDP/year in interest rates for the public sector and the economy has been stagnant this past decade till it started crumbling down with the interest rates hikes.

&gt;All in all, Goth made a reasonable point, and hurling insults wasn't really the appropriate response.

La question c'est est-ce que Snowden à révélé un complot qui, bien qu'il soit légal aux États-Unis, est contre les droits de l'homme reconnus par l’État français ? Concrètement, **est-ce qu'un pays, par le recueil des données sur ses propres citoyens, nuit aux droits de l'homme et du citoyen tels que reconnus par la France, l'UE, ou l'ONU ?** 

C'est là que la question est plus compliqué. La Constitution de la République ne fait aucune mention explicite du droit à la vie privée. Il y a bien sûr des lois pour protéger les citoyens d'une discrimination sur la base d'une information privée (e.g. ""t'es musulman, alors je t'embauche pas"") Mais rien n'exige que l’État ne doit en aucun cas toucher aux données privées des citoyens. Pareil dans la Charte des Droits fondamentaux de l'UE.

La déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme de l'ONU contient les mots ""vie privée"" exactement une fois, dans l'article 12 qui déclare : 

&gt;Nul ne sera l'objet d'immixtions arbitraires dans sa vie privée...

C'est assez vague, et les US peuvent facilement prétendre que l'espionnage n'avait pas pour but de violer cet article. Donc, dans les trois plus importantes déclarations des droits de l'homme reconnues par la France, rien n'interdit, en principe, qu'un État espionne ses propres citoyens.

Donc, il paraît que ce que fait la NSA n'est pas en contravention de la loi des États-Unis, ni des déclarations des droits de l'homme. Alors, les actions de Snowden, qui sont elles clairement contre la loi, n'ont pas de but éthique clairement visible. Ainsi, il n'est pas un réfugié politique, mais un criminel, et il peut être extradé aux US. 

C'est à Snowden maintenant de prouver que ce qu'il fait *est* en fait une action éthique contre une loi dit 'injuste'. Sans cela, il ne peut pas trouver d'asile politique en France.

&gt;A moins qu'il soit légal, dans notre droit, pour les ricains de nous espionner?

Légalement, ça c'est tout un autre sujet qui n'a rien à voir avec la demande d'asile de Snowden. Il y a moult choses à clarifier avant qu'on puisse comprendre si ce que les américains ont fait est illégal ou pas. Il y a des accords entre les citoyens français, les entreprises françaises, et les entreprises américaines qui contiennent des clauses de discrétion, mais à ce stade-ci on ne sait vraiment pas si la loi américaine qui permet la NSA de récolter ces données prend la préséance sur les accords internationaux entre entreprises et citoyens.

Istanbul's population is 13.9 million people. Turkey's is 75 million. That is not a quarter. 

Germans moved to Germany as people moved to Europe such a long time ago that evolution happened(developing white skin etc.). If such a period is enough or evolution to happen than I think it's damn long enough to call the population indigenous.

Yes they are though. Chinese we eat in Europe is a copy of Chinese food and so are mosques. They aren't pat of our culture.

Wir fangen [bei der Gründung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X11ak5qHOVs) an und arbeiten uns dann weiter zum Koordinator der Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft Schwule, Päderasten und Transsexuelle, 
Dieter F. Ullmann.

Der Päderast Ullmann war ein Sexualstraftäter, der wegen des sexuellen Missbrauchs von Kindern regelmäßig vor Gericht stand. Ein politisches Zuhause fand er in der ""Alternativen Liste"" in West Berlin, einem grünen Landesverband, von dem aus er versuchte, gezielt Einfluss auf die Gesetzgebung im Sinne der Pädophilen zu nehmen. Hauptziel war es, die ""einvernehmliche"" Vergewaltigung von Kindern straffrei zu stellen.

Wer saß denn da noch so in der Alternativen Liste West Berlin und jubelte eben dieser Person zu, anstatt sich angewidert aus solch einem verkommenen Haufen zurück zu ziehen? Na klar, das grüne Spitzenpersonal von heute. So z.B. : Renate Künast, Hans-Christian Ströbele, Wolfgang Wieland.

Aber eben auch Herr Volker Beck, der parlamentarische Bundesgeschäftsführer der Grünen. Genau dieser Päderast schrieb einen Beitrag zum Werk ""Der pädosexuelle Komplex"" unter dem Titel “Das Strafrecht ändern?”

Dazu Auszüge:

&gt;“Allein eine Mobilisierung der Schwulenbewegung für die rechtlich gesehen im Gegensatz zur Pädosexualität völlig unproblematische Gleichstellung von Homo- und Heterosexualität (…) und für die Rechte der Homosexuellen wird das Zementieren eines sexualrepressiven Klimas verhindern können – eine Voraussetzung, um eines Tages den Kampf für die zumindest teilweise Entkriminalisierung der Pädosexualität aufnehmen zu können.”

Weiter schreibt er:

&gt;„Eine Entkriminalisierung der Pädosexualität ist angesichts des jetzigen Zustandes ihrer globalen Kriminalisierung dringend erforderlich, nicht zuletzt weil sie im Widerspruch zu rechtsstaatlichen Grundsätzen aufrechterhalten wird.“

Kritik äußert er an jenen, die eine Strafbarkeit beibehalten wollen:

&gt; „Allerdings hat der Sonderausschuß sich selbst bei seinen Vorschlägen nicht daran gehalten und sich wider besseres Sachverständigenwissen für eine generelle Strafbarkeit der Sexualität mit Kindern entschieden.“

Most of the time, the distinction is blurry. For example, the state requires people to produce for the market in order to tax them: it used to demand the labor of people directly, so we've come a long way already. In fact, taxation was one of the primary drivers in the monetization of the economy in early modern times: smallholders wouldn't work more than necessary when left to their own devices, preferring free time rather than more income. The government in turn spends most of that money in the market as well...

It's also possible to have systems with significant income redistribution while still minimizing interference. For example, people can freely choose their school here, and everyone can start a school. Nevertheless all teachers are paid by the state and schooling is very cheap. So you have free services, but you also have free choice and free enterprice. There are many possibilities that don't fall in the black/white state/market dichotomy.

I don't know anything about Ria Oomen-Ruijten, her character or her accomplishments.

Yeah, I can't imagine they didn't at least have a rough idea about those activities. There's also the [Article 42](http://gigaom.com/2013/06/13/u-s-secretly-watered-down-europes-proposed-privacy-rules-report-claims/) thing, they had to have wondered where this was coming from.

The most positive interpretation is that they couldn't simply call a press conference to blow the cover off the US' and UK's spying operation for diplomatic reasons, but it's probably just that letting them do the dirty work -- and take the blame if it became public, as we're seeing now -- was so irresistibly convenient.

The question is, what happens now. *If* they ever wanted to do something about it, now they can do that with little diplomatic repercussions. If ""we, the people"" keep the pressure up, and the media is doing a fine job so far, we give them the backing they need, whether that's what our politicians want or not.

That's not that bad actually. I mean I don't know if it would help or not but at least it's a change. Given our situation I think all options may be considered.

&gt; We also want a change in the threshold that gets you into the parliament. At the moment this is 4%. People hope that decreasing it will bring more diversity in the parliament and give smaller parties a chance.

It will also rapidly increase the number of new parties formed. Let's face it. On the Balkans we are all *""experts""* when it comes to making politics.

&gt; Decrease of the number of MPs, which at the moment is 240.

Absolutely agree!

&gt; Decrease/eliminate the state subsidy for parties which have received more than 1% of the votes

Conflicts with the 2nd idea. I mean smaller parties formed would have lesser chances to continue their functioning without subsidy. I think there should be a evaluation system for new parties. Those who cannot cover the evaluation would not get subsidy. 

&gt; And the most important one, I guess, is that people want some serious commitment towards transperancy in politics. 

This is the hardest one. I, myself, do not believe this can ever happen given the current circle of political class. Ever! The current *system* was *build* this way in the course of 24 years. It will take just that much to dissolve it and replace it with a more transparent &amp; independent from organized crime in a peaceful way.
