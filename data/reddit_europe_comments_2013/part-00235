Nowadays, I still know the exact lyrics to this show's theme song.

I agree the Council of the EU and the European Council could cause some confusion, but only for their names. The European Council is necessary because the EU is an international organisation comprised of sovereign states. It's where sovereign states meet to decide what the overall competencies and powers of the EU should be in relation to the sovereign member states. 

To put it more simply, the European Council is where the EU is being formed. In my opinion, that's important enough to be kept separate from the Council of the EU, whose primary concern is to use the powers they have to govern.

Renaming the positions of the Presidents of the Commission and the Parliament, and the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU is probably a good idea, but I think the President of the European Council is fine.

So is a cell phone, still works.

All we need to do is vote people in who have our best interest, and the lack of legislative initiative makes him a far less tempting bait to the corporate sharks.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; I'm just looking at it logically, it states they and other nations have the same capabilities with the agencies that are spying.

It states BND has even better capabilities than GCHQ when it gets to high speed data links, it doesn't say anything about usage of those capabilities. As I wrote before elsewhere, you need to be able to look at every package if you want to pick out even just a single stream, this doesn't mean the entire traffic is being recorded or even shared. The very same article even mentions the much tighter restrictions BND is operating under.

&gt; Just because Snowden hasn't released a file saying it is happening, doesn't mean it's not.

That some information isn't there but that we can't rule it out from emerging in the future is hardly a basis for logically concluding that it will.  

&gt; I'm probably being cynical in assuming that the German government would fuck over other countries to get what it wants just like the UK would.

Yup, that's just cynical. Cynicism and logic aren't the same thing.

&gt; But I never stated anywhere that they are,

Right, sorry, I hadn't noticed you weren't the same poster.

&gt; I just provided sources to those who wanted it that points to BND not being completely clean.

So far, there's no indication BND disregarded aforementioned restrictions. And according to those, they can screen cross-border traffic for keywords that relate to a catalogue of seven crimes, and, under certain conditions and yet more restrictions, share those that relate to international terrorism, arms trade and human trafficking with the agencies of other countries.

&gt; It's well known that France used industrial espionage in the USA back in the early 90's, so it's not much of a leap to presume that if they can steal from IBM they had some sort of system to keep tabs on the government.

It's also well known that France and Germany aren't the same country, and no, so far there hasn't been any indication the France's intelligence agencies have tapped into allied governments' communication, either.",0,1383695424,null,0,false,0,cd7na2v,t3_1pyccj,t1_cd7na2v,t1_cd7mq3l,null,1428775953,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

* **The Council of the European Union** is like the Lords (Upper House; EU is federal, so Upper House represents the Member States).

* **The European Commission** is like the Cabinet/Government.

* The European Court of Justice is like the Supreme Court (**the Court of Justice of the European Union** being the name for the EU-level judiciary in general, including the ECJ, the General Court, and the Civil Service Tribunal).

* **The European Court of Auditors** is an independent auditing body (I'm not sure whether the UK has one of those).

* **The European Central Bank** is, of course, like the Bank of England.

* **The European Council** is the most unique institution. It's rather like a collegiate Head of State, which shares executive powers with the Commission (Government).

The ~~council~~commision has to send a letter after rejection during the registration process specifying its reasons for dismissal and suggestion possible paths of continuation, and make this letter publicly available.(You should check them, i find them quite neat, but I was raised with a low expectation of governmental transparency.)

 If a secret vote is called once one reaches the parliament, then something is seriously rotten with our representatives, and I would agree something should be done about them, and the law they choose to abuse. It should be mayhem at the very least. But at this moment its condemnation on speculation, no harm has been done, no one is guilty. Though I should make it clear that I also hold apprehensions about the mechanism.

And its unfair to compare them to white house petition, since the white house has no legislative power (in fact very little power compared to what people believe), nor are they enshrined in law, it's a feature some site admin cooked up. The bureaucratic process and even the difficulty which surrounds the initiatives enshrines their legitimacy, although I admit i'm falling into the trap of speculation here. This is a wait and see situation.

And I do hope the day for referendums will come, but that requires a bit take from national governments, and a bit more time for inter-european agencies and identity to take root. But it must happen.~

If you have Italian heritage, I would advise you to claim Italian citizenship. The process can take up to 2 years and shouldn't cost more than 1k. In terms of expats finding housing in/near Firenze, I would suggest the Italian paperwork, because it will offer you better deals and an easier time renting or buying long term and better protect you. Are you looking to rent or to buy? Both have their difficulties. I've lived in and near Firenze for years, and am currently in the US at the moment. Have you spent more than 4 months in Florence? You mentioned only two. I've also headed a study abroad program and many Americans fall in love with the city, only to move there and learn about its underbelly (Italian red-tape, immigration laws, very high cost of living, etc) and return to the US. Many Americans are not fully aware of how they are perceived by Italians, particularly in American-saturated Firenze. They are not respected. This is an understatement. And I can pass for non-American. People will automatically assume certain things about you. I would also strongly advise learning the language very well before hand. Going there and getting by on some Italian is fine when you're just visiting, but if you don't learn the language well enough, you will not be able to find stable work (even as a photographer) and you will be treated as an immigrant. I don't say this to alarm you or hamper anything, but it is very important to go in with both eyes open. I would recommend against moving to Firenze because they are highly distrustful of Americans (for good reason), unless they are married to them. Firenze is no longer ""Italian,"" due to the expats, unless that is what you are looking for. There are many, more affordable places to live in Italy with better landscape, resources, and that are safer. If that's something you'd be open to, please PM me.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"It's not a problem if you do it out of the goodness of your heart. But if you expect to be fully paid for it, especially with a hard currency, like the euro, you'll end up disappointed. 

To make this concrete, imagine there's a house where 3 people live. Imagine one of them, for some reason (either because he's smarter or more capable or just lucky enough to have more free time) decides to do more chores than the others. Every time there's a chore, he says to the others ""don't worry, I've got this"". And every time he does so, he makes a note of it on his little debt notebook. 

Now, the other people do chores too, but they can't keep up with him. Their debt to him becomes bigger and bigger until they can't even pay the interest to that debt. One day this guy realises that the chore debt will never be paid off and angrily tells his room mates they should be ashamed of themselves for being so lazy and that they should start paying him with whatever means they have (the food in their fridge, their stuff, anything) for the accumulated chore debt. And he also tells them that he won't be doing any chores for them unless they can repay them right away. 

The end result is fewer chores are done in the household because: 

1. No one asks him to do chores for them any more since they can't pay for them (aggregate demand is down).
2. The others can't do many chores because they're having problems from all the sacrifices they have to make to repay as much accumulated chore debt as possible (austerity leading to recession/depression).

Now, is this guy being reasonable? Would he be sabotaging himself if he did fewer chores (leaving him with more free time and more chores for the others) or forgave the others for not doing as many chores as him?

- American expats are not perceived as ""immigrants"" (in the way africans and east europeans are), it's more likely (but only in Rome, Florence and Venice) that Americans have to share the bad reputation coming from obnoxious tourists and drunk students.  
- Firenze has a town-like mentality and is renewed amongst Italians for having an above average amount of stronzi. There're many cities that are indeed friendlier, cheaper and easier to settle in than Firenze, where being an American is seen as a positive thing (eg. Bologna, Torino).

It is proper to always use your fork with your left hand when eating.

Hands belong above or resting on the table when eating in Germany. Having one hand rest in your lap or under the table is a no-no in proper German table etiquette. (I didn't even realize I did that until someone pointed it out to me.) Elbows on the table are okay. (I think!)

It's normal and polite to bring a small token of appreciation when visiting someone. A nicely wrapped flower(s) or a pot of jam or honey.

When someone has been visiting you you should stand at the doorway or driveway of your house and wave/watch them drive away until they are no longer visible. 

Don't invite/talk to someone about doing something unless you are genuine about it. When a German invites you to something they mean it, if you say yes then make sure you go. Don't give your number to someone unless you intend to answer or return their calls. They aren't as wishy-washy/disingenuine as Americans. 

Germans really like titles. If someone is a doctor call them ""Doktor So-and-so."" People doctors, veterinarians, anyone with a PhD is a ""Herr Doktor or Frau Doktor...""

People will often bump into you without saying ""Entschuldigung"" (""excuse me"") where as people in the States say it often.

Yeah, if the restaurant is empty you can (but you can also ask to be seated) but if it’s pretty filled it’s definitely customary to ask to be seated (well, if you haven’t reserved the first question is probably whether seats are available, but if they are you will usually be seated and don’t have to look for a table yourself, though sometimes staff may point in a general direction and say that lots of tables are available over there). If you have a reservation you should definitely ask to be seated, if only to inform the staff that someone who has reserved has arrived.

Often there is no one who is assigned to get people seated so you have to get hold of a waiter/waitress and that can be a bit awkward.

Reserved tables usually have little cards on them that say “Reserviert” and sometimes also a last name, though from that angle it’s true that you can seat yourself if you really wanted to. But especially if it’s full staff can usually do some table-wrangling and is generally better informed when and where you might get a seat.

I can see where you are coming from, though. It’s definitely a weird mixed system in Germany where sometimes you seat yourself and sometimes not, even in the same restaurant.

And hey OP, you should probably ask some American who was in Germany as a student before. I don’t think Germans will be able to tell you very much, they don’t have the experience. Because looking in each others eyes as any kind of important custom or taboo? Seriously, that’s just unimportant bullshit. It’s not a taboo to not do it and if you don’t Germans will be more than happy to explain it to you. They will not be angry or annoyed with you. They know it’s a weird and dumb custom, that’s why this guy or girl above me brought it up. And that’s called making conversation. This guy or girl just stole a conversational topic away from you that could have been interesting. Boo!

Also, OP, student life is pretty cool and there is really not much you can do wrong, I think. It’s not like you are going here to have business meetings, so relax.

true,Panzergraf,null,null,"As some already pointed out: Nearly every Gymnasium is different, I went to a technical Gymnasium and had a whole different expericence to a friend of mine who went to general (modern) Gymnasium which was run by monks from the Franciscan Order. 

I went to Realschule for the years 5 - 10 and had good enough grades to ""upgrade"" to Gymnasium instead of ""just"" getting a job. So I went to a small Gymnamisum which specialised in technical fields which meant I could take a mayor like computer science which I did (the other special mayors where engineering and electrical engineering). 
The school just did the years 10 -13 so you'd have to switch to it anyway, if you are already in a Gymnasium or, as me, just finished, Realschule and had the needed grades to do so. 
Other courses (all mandatory) included sports, art, music, history, german, physics and  chemestry.

We had so called ""double"" classes which meant every course lasted 1 hour 30 minutes and had from 8:00 to 15:00 or 16:45 mostly every day. (depending on if you have had 4 or 5 90 min classes on this day) 15 min break between classes, 30 min break on lunch. No Cantina or school provided food.

Each course has in a different room so we had to walk to a different room every 90 minutes.

Each course lasted a half year and had two Exams: One after roughly the first three months, one at the end. You could do something more like a presentation, but the exams determined your grades, extra stuff just helped you getting the better grade if you stood between two grades. Grades where given in ""points"" from 0 (worst) to 15 (best)

Edit: Homework! Forgot about the homework. 
Lots of it, but after the first year most of the teachers didn't checked it anymore. Their usual approach was: ""You aren't in elementry school anymore, we are not your parents and the exams are coming if you do them or not"". 

Question were answerd and stuff could be explained a second time, maybe even a third, in and after class, but the course was proceeded if you had gotten it or not.
The teachers were somewhat hardass in these things but most also were really trying to get thier stuff into your skull. There was one, hilarious, time when we asked our physics teacher (@16:00 -&gt; after school) about something and he got so upset that we didn't got it, that he pulled out his keys, opend the next classroom, pulled us in, scribbeld the whole whiteboard with equations and didn't let us leave until we got it. Which meant he did this in his sparetime after work.

I did pretty well in english for example and usually didn't do any homework there, my math homework on the other hand was something I never skipped, because it would usually have been a desasterous whiplash in the next lesson to me.

You had to choose another mayor and two minors and you had choose one from each [I don't know the right word here] ""field"" (science, linguistics, social science), which meant my second mayor was math, my minors english and social studies). I did enough french in my realschule time to be able to skip the second foreign language that was mandatory to others who haven't had the same amount of second foreign language in their Realschule.

Explanation germans use the word ""class"" to classify your years in school, first class is first year and so on. Elementary school is class 1-4, Realschule is year 5 - 10, an so on

We startet in 11 ""class"" (first half) in mid 1996 with ~ 120 new students in four groups a 30 students 

On the beginning of 1997 (""class"" 11 second half ) roughly 40 guys had thrown the towel and we were down to three groups. 

Mid 97 transition from ""class"" 11 to class 12, I guess we were down to ~ 60 Guys by then

Begin 98 transition from ""class"" 12 first half to ""class"" 12 second half, the number of students was pretty stable at that time

I got into learning trouble by mid 98 and botched my transition from ""class"" 12 second to 13 first and had to reapeat ""class"" 12 completly (which did wonders to my grades). Some guys left at this time because with completion you have to so called ""Fachabitur"" which allows you to study on collages, but only in the field which your fachAbitur mayor was.

Again ""class"" 12 first and second for me in 98/99, again some guys left after the second halt of ""class"" 12 with their Fachabitur. We were down two two groups with ~20 students in each

Mid 99: Transition to class 13 first half

begin 2000: Transition to class 13 second half

mid 2000: Prepartion for and doing the major tests for final examination. We still had guys who botched these tests big time (literally gaining scores between 0-2 from possible 15) and small time (you had to reach specific sums of scores in certain fields, which meant you could both some courses without consequences, but had to do good in the mayority [I for example ignored an Art Course in my last year, got a zero score and it didn't do anything to my needed sums])

Depends on the size of the town. In a small town, chances are that most people will casually greet you if you pass them on an empty sidewalk, even if you are just a tourist and don't know the other person.

In Sicilia non è mai stata presente la resistenza come la conosciamo noi (ovvero gruppi armati sostenuti da potenze alleate), anche perchè i governi alleati non avevano fiducia nelle popolazioni meridionali.
Considerato che lo sbarco in sicilia (Op. Husky) fu la più grande operazione navale ed anfibia sino ad allora mai successa, con una superiorità alleata su tutti i fronti (aerea, marittima, terrestre) e soprattutto considerata la situazione italiana al momento dello sbarco, possiamo affermare che lo scontro durato 6 settimane (con la resa inspiegabile di Augusta, che di fatto, accellerò la risalita ad est) può essere ritenuto debole ma efficace poichè consentì la ritirata aldilà dello Stretto delle maggiori forze dell'Asse.

Classes from 7.30am to 1.15pm for grades 5 to 10. Grade 11 and 12 had classes up until 2pm.

Breaks were ten minutes, a 20min breakfast break at 10.05am and a 25min lunch break at 12.05. Lunch was served, but had to be paid for. The big breaks (breakfast and lunch) had to be spent either in the dining-hall or the schoolyard. No bumming around in classrooms or the halls.

Students definitely did move fom class to class. There was always a big migration going on during the breaks. Teachers also moved. 

Grades 11 and 12 didn't have fixed classes with all students having the same schedule, but rather what we called courses, being mixed up for every subject, because not every student did have every subject. They could chose I think 12 subjects or so, but had to keep certain rules. It was 2 main courses and 10 basic courses. Where I lived the first main course had to be mathematics or german, the first basic course was the one that wasn't chosen as first main. The other basic courses were set up from different fields. There had to be languages, social science stuff and natural science, arts and sports.

First foreign language was english from grade 5. Second could be chosen between French and Russian in grade 7. Latin was optional from grade 7 I think.

In the afternoon there were so-called AGs (Arbeitsgemeinschaft, working groups), like school choir, the volleyball team or the biology group. Each AG met once a week, so you could attend more than one. AGs typically finished around 4pm.

This is my completely anecdotal experience, so take that as you will. I'm quite the francophile with a French SO, many French friends, and considerable time spent living in France with French people. Especially among the older generations there is a feeling that the French language is on some sort of higher cultural level than other languages and that it should be protected from corrupting influences. This idea is also deeply rooted in the government which has historically done it's very best to stamp out any other language but French in France, effectively removing most minority languages from the country. Even in modern times, institutions have imposed obligatory classes in French for university courses and the level of languages taught at schools is on a very low level on average. 

That doesn't mean that all French people are arrogant about their language. I've met many French people who would love to speak better English and never got the opportunity, many French people who are shy to speak English because they never got taught decent English, and many French people ashamed of the few people in France speaking English. But it is a systemic problem, and one that isn't helped by the pride many other French people take in their language.

Ich kann dazu nichts sagen, da ich erst nach der Wiedervereinigung geboren wurde.

&gt; Identifizieren Sie sich noch als Ost oder West-deutscher? wenn nicht, wann haben sie aufgehört als Ost- oder West deutscher zu identifizieren? 

Wenn ich mit Ostdeutschen zusammenarbeite, dann machen wir manchmal (doofe) Witze über unsere Herkunft. Das gleiche machen wir aber auch, wenn Bayern und Niedersachsen oder Kölner und Düsseldorfer zusammentreffen. Unter den Jugendlichen spielt die Herkunft meiner Erfahrung nach kaum noch eine Rolle - bei (älteren) Erwachsenen sieht das manchmal anders aus.
 
&gt; Wie fanden Sie das Prozess der Wiedervereinigung? was könnte besser gemacht geworden sein?

Es wurden wirtschaftliche Fehler gemacht. Unser damaliger Kanzler Helmut Kohl hatte den Menschen ""blühende Landschaften"" versprochen, was falsch war. 23 Jahre später gibt es einige sehr schöne Städte mit tollen Kultureinrichtungen und guter Infrastruktur im Osten, aber in den kleinen Dörfern herrscht hohe Arbeitslosigkeit und oft Wut darüber, wie die Wiedervereinigung abgelaufen ist.

&gt; Hat die Wiedervereinigung dein Leben direkt verändert?

Sicher, wie das ganze Ende des Kalten Krieges. Allerdings hat sich das Leben der Menschen im Osten sicher viel stärker geändert als meins.

&gt; Hat die Mauer Dich von Familien schiedet? Wie ging das vor und noch der Mauerfall? 

Meine Urgroßeltern waren nach dem 2. Weltkrieg in den Osten geflohen (aus dem heutigen Polen). Als die Situation immer schlechter wurde ist die ganze Familie in den Westen geflohen. Alle, außer meiner Großmutter, die im Osten noch ihren Schulabschluss machen und dann nachkommen wollte. Doch die Behörden verboten es ihr, da ihre Familie ja geflohen war. Also floh sie auch durch einen U-Bahntunnel nach Westberlin und von dort aus in den Norden Deutschlands. Sie war die letzte aus meiner Familie (von der ich weiß), die im der DDR geblieben war.

Un isotope radioactif fissionne spontanément sur Terre. Par contre la fusion spontanée de l'hydrogène non. En gros pour maîtriser la fusion il faut la provoquer ET la contrôler alors que fondamentalement pour la fission l'essentiel c'est de la contrôler.

Oui il y a la question de l'enrichissement et non, je ne veux pas dire que la fission est triviale, seulement que la fusion est par essence excessivement plus difficile à maîtriser.

&gt; Keuwaaa ? Une techno à demi maitrisée depuis 30 ans ne représente plus autant un défi qu'avant ? Well; no shit cap'tain.

Tu es conscient que puisqu'on fait déjà de la recherche sur la fusion, elle sera problablement aussi développée un jour quoi qu'il arrive ? La question n'est pas tant de savoir si ça sera fait mais quand. Le problème pour la fusion c'est que l'incertitude est encore énorme.

&gt; Soit tu confond tes priorités, soit n'as rien compris, soit me prends pour un idiot (ou d'autres lecteurs); soit un mix du tout. 

Ni l'un, ni l'autre. Le stockage de l'énergie permet de décorréler la production de l'utilisation de l'électricité. C'est la clé pour que les énergies renouvelables prennent une part nettement plus importante dans le mix énergétique, mais aussi la clé pour optimiser l'utilisation de nos centrales nucléaires (dont la production n'est pas facilement modulable par rapport à la fluctuation jour/nuit de la conso d'énergie).

Là encore ça n'est pas une solution ultime, mais ça donne du temps supplémentaire pour abandonner progressivement le nucléaire ancienne génération.

It could very well be that, but I've definitely experienced very haughty attitudes towards other foreign languages.

Mind you, those are not my words.. 

I'm sure that you and many of the people you associate with are absolutely not like this, and in fact most French people aren't. But there is a definite subsection of your population, especially in the older generations, that does entertain such ideas.

I was stating in /r/europe over a year ago that the Germans and Dutch were scumbags for exporting in the Euro to southern states. The Germans/Dutch win doubly because their exporting in a currency which is valued quite high to economies that aren't as productive **and they're importing less**.

Essentially if Germany had to export to Greece/Portgual/Italy in their previous currency their exports would be worth considerably less. Germany would profit less and the southern states currency would adjust to be worth far less than a German Mark.

This - in my view - is the worst part of this currency because it means it can only fail because it is still a union of sovereign countries and countries are going to do what benefits them and fuck everybody else.

&gt;The US has criticised Germany's economic policies, saying that its export-led growth model is hurting the eurozone and the wider global economy. 

&gt;""Germany's anaemic pace of domestic demand growth and dependence on exports have hampered rebalancing at a time when many other euro-area countries have been under severe pressure to curb demand and compress imports in order to promote adjustment,"" the Treasury said.

&gt;""The net result has been a deflationary bias for the euro area as well as for the world economy.""

true,Gro-Tsen,null,null,"&gt; For the almighty French, only their language is worthy!

How about we try to look a bit further than the cliché?

Saying that the French have (or at least: had) an aversion against English is more or less true.  But this is quite different from saying that ""only their language is worthy"": if anything, it'd be ""any language other than English is worthy"".

For example, until a few years ago, learning English was not mandatory in French high schools: students entering junior high school had a choice of first foreign language, with German being the main choice other than English (though other choices, like Russian, exist in some high schools); this is a consequence of the 1963 Élysée treaty signed by De Gaulle and Adenauer (see part II, section C(1)(a)): now France has a huge number of German language teachers and since the tide is turning and nobody now cares about anything other than English, the question of what to do with these teachers is somewhat problematic.  Similarly, as a second foreign language, French students generally took Spanish (at least those who had taken English as first foreign language), and until recently the general idea was to give both foreign languages roughly equal importance.

Well you can blame the French for having had the stupid idea of teaching such exotic languages as German and Spanish instead of immediately recognizing that the world would speak English and that only English was worth studying, but you should at least see that it's a bit more complex than ""nous ne parlerons que le français"".

A similar position holds at the diplomatic level, ever since De Gaulle made it a point to speak German to the Germans.  Take the EU: French MEPs have a reputation of annoying everyone by insisting on not speaking English in committees (in the plenary, it's still more or less acceptable for everyone to speak their own language, but in committees translators are harder to access): this is true, but their point is not that they want everyone to speak or understand French, it's that they don't want the EU to become purely English-speaking¹ at the institutional level: and the France would *much* prefer the Germans to speak German and defend the use of their language at the EU level, something which Germany refuses to do.

¹ Certainly not when the UK is threatening to pull out of the EU and the other English-speaking country in the Union is itself trying to defend the survival of another language (I'm sure the French would prefer Gaelic to be the EU's sole official language rather than English).

Concerning web sites, since you raise the question, there is [a French law](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005616341) which requires (article 4, first paragraph) that if a public service has a publication of any kind (including a web site) which is translated into some foreign language, there must be *at least two* (this is, of course, specifically to avoid translating everything into English and only English, at the detriment of every other language).  I'm not going to defend this law (which is frequently ignored, or backfires in the sense that, as you noticed, some web sites prefer not to have any translation than have one in two different languages), but, again, it's more complex than the French wanting to save only the French language.",0,1383734268,null,0,false,0,cd7ym1s,t3_1q0j2g,t1_cd7ym1s,t1_cd7xct9,null,1428770525,26,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,26

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Un isotope radioactif fissionne spontanément sur Terre

Parler de ""un isotope radioactif"" reviens à dire que ""le metal fond naturellement si on le chauffe sur terre, fabriquer un bateau géant comme le Queens mary II ne nécessite donc aucune connaissance particulière"". C'est du foutage de gueule pur et simple. 

La fission nucléaire; celle qui rapporte de l'énergie dans une centrale, ne porte que sur des isotopes très particuliers et souvent produits artificiellement via un processus appellé ""enrichissement"". Celui ci est absolument tout sauf naturel; tout sauf simple; et le résultat d'un effort de guerre immensse par les plus grands cerveau de la planete sur plusieurs décades sous peine de mort imminente.

La science de la fusion est par ailleurs connu : C'est un problème **d'ingénieur** de nos jours (pour produire plus de courant que le champ de contention EM n'en consomme); pas de science de base. 

La fission à commencé exactement pareil : les premiers réacteurs expérimentaux ne produisaient pas de courant; mais en perdait en pratique.

Et comment on résoud un problème d'ingénierie ? En le remettant à des ingénieur. Comment trouve ton des ingénieurs ? En les formant, recrutant, payant. Un processus que beaucoup semblent avoir oublié de nos jours. 

Mais bon on préfère laisser les cerveau fuir et recruter des chinois à moindre prix dans les usines foxconn et on s'étonne de n'avoir plus aucun savoir faire. C'est dingue non ?

La situation c'est simple : On en est au point ou on est *en retard* vis à vis de notre technologie passée. L'""ouest"" ne sait même plus  tirer d'astronaute en orbite de nos jours tellement on se repose sur tlm et on en est réduit à payer les russes et les chinois.

Si tu veux relancer l'occident, il faudra commencer par tabler sur le seul domaine qu'on fait encore un peu de nos jours : Le service; et donc le savoir faire. Ce qui veux dire recruter et GARDER nos cerveaux. Pas leur proposer un smic pour 60H/semaine et s'étonner quand les mecs se cassent à l'étranger. Et donc INVESTIR.

&gt; Ni l'un, ni l'autre. Le stockage de l'énergie permet de décorréler la production de l'utilisation de l'électricité. 

Pas vraiment non. Il permettrait de déplacer le problème de la voiture à essence sur l'électrique et donc les centrales au lieu de bruler plein de pétrole. Il ne dit en revanche rien sur la production de cette énergie que tu stock. Qui passe par une centrale. Qui  consomme qque chose. 

Je préfèrerait encore que ce soit de l'hydrogène plutôt que du plutonium dont on sais pas quoi faire à long terme dans l'immédiat.

&gt; (dont la production n'est pas facilement modulable par rapport à la fluctuation jour/nuit de la conso d'énergie).

Peut-être. Mais admettons que tu invente un super capaciteur de la mort avec des nanotubes et du graphene, ou un nouveau truc à base de conversion d'hydrogene qui n'explose pas quand tu le regarde un peu fort ou je sais pas quoi;

tu gagnera 10% ou 20% de capa au mieux. Maintenant les réacteurs atomiques fournissent *80%* de notre consommation. Qui monte. Sans parler du switch du parc de véhicule vers l'électrique qu'on va être OBLIGES d'assumer sous 10 ans sous peine de bankerouter devant le prix du petrole qui monte; avoir des guerres et que ca finisse mal de manière générale pour l'occident.

Pour l'instant on va continuer avec nos centrales nucléaires; mais à *long* terme ; genre 50 ans; il faudra mieux. Si on obtenait la fusion un peu en avance, ca nous ferait un savoir faire très recherché qu'on pourait exploiter comme une poule aux oeufs d'or au lieu de devoir avoir des déchets dont on sais pas quoi faire ou devoir cirrer les pompes des américains ou chinois pour leur quémander quand ils auront trouvé (parce que eux ils cherchent).

true,charlu,null,null,"ATTAC donne cet avis sur ce dont parle Mélenchon en Bretagne :
""""Ce n'est pas l'écotaxe qu'il faut geler, c'est la TVA !


La mobilisation contre l'écotaxe en Bretagne manifeste sous une forme contestable et pour partie dévoyée la colère populaire qui monte contre une politique économique et écologique dramatiquement inadaptée aux enjeux actuels. S'il poursuit dans cette voie le gouvernement de François Hollande va dans le mur. Un premier signe de réorientation passerait par la suspension de la hausse prévue de la TVA au 1er janvier.

La révolte bretonne contre l'écotaxe est elle une manipulation patronale ou une juste lutte pour l'emploi ? Selon certains, le Medef et la FNSEA, principaux responsables de l'échec du « modèle breton » avec leurs choix productivistes et polluants, réussiraient ainsi à se dédouaner tout en torpillant toute fiscalité écologique. Pour d'autres, le mouvement veut légitimement défendre l'emploi et le pouvoir d'achat contre la politique économique et fiscale désastreuse du gouvernement.

Ces thèses apparemment contradictoires sont en réalité toutes deux exactes. Dans la récente manifestation de Quimper, où agriculteurs, patrons et ouvriers de l'agro-alimentaire défilaient ensemble contre l'écotaxe, c'est le recours aux symboles historiques et culturels (le bonnet rouge, le drapeau breton) qui a fait tenir ensemble, peut-être provisoirement, ces deux dynamiques.

Le grand responsable de cette confusion, c'est le gouvernement de François Hollande. Il fournit sur un plateau à la droite et aux oligarques de Bretagne (et d'ailleurs) foison d'arguments pour capitaliser sur la colère populaire. En cause : une politique fiscale aberrante et une politique de transition écologique inexistante.

François Hollande s'est rallié au credo du Medef sur la compétitivité : 20 milliards d'exonérations supplémentaires (le « crédit d'impôt compétitivité-emploi ») seront financés par la hausse de la TVA au 1er janvier prochain et par de nouvelles coupes dans les dépenses publiques. Pour réduire à marche forcée les déficits publics comme l'impose le Traité budgétaire européen accepté par la France, il a alourdi l'impôt sur le revenu (gel du barême, suppression d'avantages pour les familles) et va augmenter les cotisations sociales (réforme des retraites). Au moment où les salaires stagnent et où le chômage explose, les ménages aux revenus moyens ou faibles perçoivent toutes ces hausses comme une agression fiscale.

Dans ce contexte l'écotaxe est le bouc-émissaire idéal pour le patronat. Elle avait pourtant au départ d'excellentes justifications : accroître le coût du transport routier pourrait aider une démarche cohérente de relocalisation des productions et de transition écologique. Mais l'écotaxe issue du Grenelle de Sarkozy n'est qu'une caricature de taxe écologique.

D'abord parce qu'elle ne touche que les transports sur les routes et autoroutes gratuites, épargnant l'essentiel du trafic de longue distance qui passe par les autoroutes à péage – privatisés à bas prix par la droite en 2006. Ensuite parce que le partenariat public-privé confié dans des conditions douteuses à l'entreprise Ecomouv est une véritable spoliation, puisque 20% des recettes attendues iront au partenaire privé. Et ce, même si l'écotaxe n'entre pas en vigueur, du fait des pénalités prévues au contrat. Enfin parce que ces recettes n'iront pas au financement d'une politique de transition écologique dans le domaine des transports.

Car l'écotaxe illustre aussi la démission du gouvernement en matière de transition écologique. On prétend vouloir décourager le transport routier, mais où est le plan de développement massif du ferroutage et de transport ferroviaire de marchandises ? Dans les faits la SNCF poursuit son désengagement accéléré du fret ferroviaire via sa filiale Geodis. En Allemagne au contraire la Deutsche Bahn le développe massivement : les modes alternatifs au routier représentent 11% du trafic de marchandises en France contre 30% Allemagne.

Pour Attac la crise sociale et écologique impose une réorientation radicale :

-une politique fiscale à la fois fortement redistributive (renforcer l'impôt progressif sur le revenu et les grandes fortunes, taxer la finance) et écologique (taxe sur les émissions de CO2 et les transports au long cours)

-une politique de l'emploi axée sur la réduction du temps de travail et des investissements massifs dans la transition écologique : transport ferroviaire, énergies renouvelables, économies d'énergie...

-un soutien à la relocalisation des productions


Dans l'immédiat ce n'est pas d'abord l'écotaxe qu'il faut suspendre mais la hausse de la TVA au 1er janvier 2014, qui va amputer le revenu des catégories populaires et aggraver la récession.

But that is against the ECB statues.

Furthermore, if you look at Target 2, the credit given to southern Europe is close to a trillion (I belive, whatever comes after billion) and I think Greece alone has about 300 billions in credit. How much credit do you want? Four trillions? 20 trillions? When is it enough for you?

&gt;The debts from the past are a millstone around the neck of the EU economy. The religious insistence on paying off debts with hard work is holding us back.

So you do not want to pay back loans? Well, then we need a completely new economy. It is a novel and perhaps interesting idea, but a world without loans - well, I don't belive in it.

Wenn deutsche Autofahrer tatsächlich über die Kfz-Steuer von den Mautkosten befreit würden, blieben als Netto-Zahler nur die etwa 5% ausländischen PKWs auf den Autobahnen übrig.

true,mirstamina,NETH,The Netherlands,"This article is a little misleading, and certainly biased as well. 
First of all, the Arctic Sunrise is presented as if it is some event at the end of the whole year, as some sort reaction by the Russians towards the whole diplomatic scandal. It was however before the arrest of Borodin and the break-in at the house of the Dutch diplomat.

Secondly the article forgets to mention that the police brought the wife of Borodin back home after she had rammed a few cars while drunk. They did not come there to arrest Borodin, but did so when they saw him, drunk, dragging his kids by their hair. This was because they considered him an immediate threat to his kids, and posing an immidiate threat to others is one of the few reasons why a diplomat can be detained according to the Vienna convention. The 'apology' the article mentioned however, was simply, 'I am very sorry that we did something against the Vienna convention, but I understand why the police did what they did.' Which simply infuriated Putin, and was still too much of an apology according to quite some Dutch.

Furthermore, the Dutch think that justice should always prevail, and quite some citizens are mad that the Russians did not prosecute Borodin, as his immunity doesn't mean he is impervious to the law, only to Dutch law.
Thirdly, there was a break-in at the house of a member of the Russian embassy, after the Dutch diplomat was abused in his house. The police was there quickly, with a considerable force, and the perpatrator was arrested a few days later.

And to continue, the whole Arctic sunrise thing was simply illegal. The Arctic Sunrise was in international waters, and the Russians didn't have the right to detain them. This is also infuriating to the Dutch because of how they view justice, and they think this is way worse than the whole thing involving the Russian and Dutch diplomats. The general consensus here is  how dare they arrest Dutch citizens who were just protesting, especially if it wasn’t even in Russia?

By now, most Dutch dislike Russia strongly, and the only reasons we did not yet go into an all-out diplomatic war, is that we need the Russian oil and gas, and that some people thankfully are smart enough to recognise the economic ties between Russia and the Netherlands.

Most of the anger comes from viewing Russia as a bully, who bullies greenpeace, gays and its eastern european neighbours. The Dutch are also much more used to protests, and think that protesting is something that should never be taken as an insult. Also freedom of speech is considered very important. We for instance have Geert Wilders, who hates islam, most of the people consider him a nutjob, who promotes hatred, but we let him speak. 
Therefore, the rally in Amsterdam was something that was not viewed as trying to insult Putin by the Dutch, and that those were just people using their freedom of speech. The same thing goes for the politicians, they spoke out for gay rights, but that should not be considered an insult, rather a personal opinion, and the opinion of the people. Because it actually is the opinion of the people. Gay marriage was allowed in 2001. And now we consider someone treating gays as different as a bad, discriminative person, to the point that it is close to discriminating against women or other races. 

The Dutch and Russian views are very different, and that combined with how vocal the Dutch are, and how quick the Russians move from words to actions, and how the Dutch view saying something and doing something as completely different tiers, this was bound to escalate.

TL;DR This article misses a lot of issues, and does not say much about the Dutch view on this year, so here it is. By the way, the Dutch think Putin is an arrogant bully, pretending he has the power Stalin had.

- Classes get longer the higher your grade is. Classes usually last to at least 3PM nowaday. Used to be different a couple of years ago.
They usually have a place where you can buy lunch but it is very common to bring your own lunch

- Teachers move unless they need certain equipment (sports, art, muic,physics,chem)

- Periods are often double periods but can be 45 min long.

- English is usually required. Some Gymnasien force you into the mathematical tree by taking latin and into the language tree by taking french.

- You can only pick which classes you take in the very highest grade. Before the only choice you make is your secondary language.

- It goes from grade 5-12 in the same building. One grade usually has a couple of classes with ~30 people depending on the school size.

- There is not half as much after school activity as in the US. Most of this stuff is done in town organized clubs.

- Every day has completley different subjects

- Typical classes in almost every grade is: english, maths, german, physics, biology, religion, geography,history, sports, music, art. In the higher grades you get stuff like chem, another language, ~economy and law etc. you might also be able to take away a few like music. It is possible to take a few classes in english too. (geography,history)

- Math is not done with a TI-whatever it was. You do get to use a calculator though. 

- The tests in common felt a lot easier in the US even in honor classes. Not that they taught you that much different stuff but the tests were a lot harder so you actually needed to know what you learned (50% right is a passed test in Germany and even that is way harder to reach than the ?65%? in the US. Everything below 40% counts as 0% (mark is 6 out of 1 to 6).

La difesa Luttazziana sulla legittimità assoluta della satira è una cazzata:  
Non è vero che il potere non ha il diritto di decidere cosa è legittimo e cosa non lo è, quello che non può fare è il settare diversi parametri a seconda dell'occasione. il potere è liberissimo di dirti anticipatamente entro quali limiti qualcosa verrà considerato pornografico o blasfemo, e la società ha il diritto di protestare se ritiene che questi limiti siano troppo stretti.

Allo stesso modo, non può essere il comico a decidere cosa è legittimo,  esiste quanto meno un contratto virtuale con il pubblico che pone dei limiti di buon senso e buon gusto, oltrepassati i quali la satira smette di essere diretta ad un bersaglio e diventa offensiva nei confronti di tutto il pubblico.  
  
Domanda: -eh.. ma i comici americani a cui copio le battute fanno i monologhi sul sesso anale e tutti ridono, se il pubblico italiano è pudico e perbenista faccio bene ad offenderlo, così gli apro la mente -    

Risposta: I comici americani le battute sul cazzo e sulla merda le fanno al chiuso davanti ad una platea pagante, non sulla tv generalista dove se pronunci la parola ""tits"" ti censurano. 
Così facendo stipulano un contratto direttamente con il proprio pubblico e sono liberi di dettarne i termini.   
Quando sei in televisione, il rapporto di fiducia col pubblico è stato stipulato da un editore, non da te, ed è l'editore a decidere cosa sia consono trasmettere. Se fai una battuta che un parte del pubblico generalista giudica di cattivo gusto, l'editore ha tutto il diritto di dire ""questo non rientra nei contenuti che vogliamo trasmettere al nostro pubblico, sei licenziato"". E no, non puoi piangere censura politica e non puoi venirci a dire che il tuo show era molto visto e portava pubblicità, se l'azienda crede che tu abbia violato il contratto con il suo pubblico ha il diritto di terminare la collaborazione.

Firstly and regarding the language barriers, let's just say I'm perfectly capable of speaking English on daily basis - I've been to several European countries (including English-speaking) and I have no problems on that matter. Other than that, I can speak Spanish quite fluently, Portuguese and a tiny bit of French - which isn't that relevant. *(sorry for copying and pasting this bit from a previous answer but I have a class in a bit and need to hurry)*

Secondly, the Scandinavia is indeed a preferred place and the KTH seems to be a really good fit. I'm, however, clueless about what grades you must have to be accepted on that University - is there any way I can have access to this type of information?

On a last note, in terms of housing and daily costs, it's not that relevant compared to other aspects. Sure, Sweden - as do other North European countries - has a high standard of living but I'm fortunate enough to have my parents' support and also to managed to save some money through jobs I did over the last few months/years.

Both include grammar, vocabulary, reading, and listening sections.

The non-adaptive test is 70 questions in length. All scores have been validated against EF’s course levels.

Nella sua storia, poco conta che si professi innocente e che le prove indiziarie sulla base delle quali è stato condannato a 9 anni in primo grado (per una rissa con un ferito grave) siano destinate – a detta del suo difensore – a cadere in appello. Quel che conta è che Brian Gaetano Bottigliero è malato. Gravemente. Da mesi lascia la cella tre volte a settimana per sottoporsi a dialisi. Aspetta un trapianto di rene – senza il quale non avrebbe futuro – ma non può essere operato perché nel carcere romano ha perso 15 chili ed è gravemente debilitato.

&gt; «ANDREMO ANCHE NOI AL DAP» - «Quando ho sentito del caso di Giulia Ligresti e dell’intervento presso i Dap che ha risolto la sua detenzione facendole guadagnare gli arresti domiciliari – dice Antonio Bottigliero, il padre di Brian – mi sono chiesto: ma allora abbiamo sbagliato tutto? Tutti i nostri ricorsi dovevano andare al Dipartimento dell’amministrazione penitenziaria anziché al giudice competente? Oppure dovevamo rivolgerci anche noi al ministro Cancellieri?»
&gt; MEANDRI BUROCRATICI - Il caso di Brian è esemplare di come tanti casi di malati detenuti nelle carceri italiane si complichino nei meandri dell’iter burocratico per la scarcerazione, che quasi mai viene concessa. Lo scorso gennaio 2013, Brian viene ricoverato d’urgenza in pericolo di vita all’ospedale Santo Spirito: un ricovero arrivato tardi, nonostante da mesi Brian avesse chiesto assistenza sanitaria per evidenti problemi di salute. Gli viene diagnosticata una grave insufficienza renale e dopo 7 giorni – a febbraio – Brian viene trasferito all’ospedale Sandro Pertini, sezione medicina protetta (la stessa dove venne ricoverato Stefano Cucchi).
&gt; 
&gt; LA MALATTIA DIVENTA CRONICA - Fatti tutti gli accertamenti, la diagnosi è «insufficienza renale cronica». Ma dopo circa tre mesi, dimesso dal Pertini in via di guarigione, con patologie in atto che non potevano essere assistite dal Centro clinico di Regina Coeli, viene rimandato nel penitenziario sul lungotevere. Qui nessuno gli consente di seguire la dieta prescritta dai medici. In stato di grave prostrazione fisica e psicologica inizia il calo ponderale: il giovane detenuto Brian perde circa 15 chili.

&gt; PATOLOGIE INSORTE DA MESI - L’estate trascorre tra sofferenze e periodiche uscite per la dialisi finché, ad ottobre 2013, Brian viene nuovamente trasferito in ospedale, al Pertini, in seguito ad un malore a Regina Coeli e viene ricoverato per accertamenti. I medici constatano «un quadro clinico caratterizzato da nausea, vomito, astenia e dimagrimento insorti da alcuni mesi». Pesa ormai 63 chili, contro gli 83 di quando era stato arrestato.
&gt; DIALISI E PERICOLO DI FUGA - A inizio novembre, però, solo tre giorni fa, Brian viene rimandato in carcere al Regina Coeli, «dove di nuovo non potrà essere assistito come la sua patologia richiede» accusa il padre. Che ricorda: «Abbiamo presentato istanza di scarcerazione per incompatibilità carceraria per gravi motivi di salute: la nostra richiesta è stata rigettata con la motivazione del pericolo di fuga. Ma dove può fuggire un ragazzo che non sta in piedi e che deve sottoporsi a dialisi in continuazione?».
&gt; 
&gt; «GIUDIZIO COPIA-INCOLLA» - Anche il ricorso al Tribunale della liberta è stato rigettato. Motivazione: pericolo di reiterazione del reato. «Peccato che le accuse di chi sosteneva avesse colpito un uomo con un casco siano cadute (le motivazioni del primo processo, aprile 2013, hanno escluso l’uso del casco) e quell’elemento probatorio non valga più nulla – obietta il padre -. Ma il giudizio del Tribunale della Libertà pare un copia-incolla delle motivazioni di un’altra sentenza del 2011».
&gt; 
&gt; VICENDA CLINICA ASSURDA - Ora i genitori del ragazzo confidano in un nuovo ricorso, ma resta il rammarico per una vicenda clinica che ha dell’assurdo: «Se nostro figlio avesse avuto un’adeguata assistenza sanitaria all’insorgere dei primi sintomi, la sua patologia – in origine banale - non sarebbe degenerata», sottolineano. «Due anni senza adeguate cure lo hanno distrutto, ridotto a uno scheletro. E adesso, gli arresti domiciliari alla Ligresti, causa eccessivo dimagrimento e prostrazione psicologica… Ma allora, cosa dobbiamo per salvare il nostro ragazzo?».ROMA – Un ragazzo di 24 anni è chiuso in una cella di Regina Coeli da oltre due anni in attesa del processo d’appello.

Nobody in college will care if he eats with his left or right hand, almost nobody will care about his ellbows, nobody will expect a gift or flowers if OP is invited to another WG (aside from a few beers or alcohol when it comes to pregaming, unless told otherwise).

 Nobody expets OP to wave goodbye to his friends forever. 

With OP being American I think German students would be really excited to exchange small talk with him, I know me and m friends would.

 With the phone numbers thing I also disagree, especially at the start of the semesteryou are likely to collect dozens of numbers you will never use because people are keen on meeting new people. And I'm afraid to admit I exchanged phone numbers with girls way too often I did not intend to call afterwards when out partying. Though I always feel like a dick aobut that later on.

I feel like you exaggerated on the Dr. thing as well. If I talk to a professor I always simply adress them without the title, they never seem to mind. Sure there are some that are anal about it, but I have never been scolded for failing to adress somebody with the correct title.

You are right with the Enschuldigung,  Americans have this weird habbit of apologizing to you when out shopping and walking in front of your view of the products you were looking at or even just for walking by you while you were standing there. Don't expect that here OP, nobody does that. You are right about the Sunday peace, even vacuum cleaning or washing clothes can get your neighbors pissy if you are unlucky.

This is all from the perspective of a college student. I guess OP, what is important for you is to realize that you live in a microcosm being a foreign exchane student. I get a feeling that student life in Germany is more integrated into society than it is compared to the US with those giant campuses that meet your every need, nonetheless you will mostly be in contact with people really similar to you. Sure you will deal with a few (who am I kidding a lot) of bureaucrats, but I'm sure hanging around other students most of the time you will have a pretty relaxed stay spared of most of the uptight German rules and Ordnung.

If there are major treaties that affect the structure of the EU and there are only one or two countries who don't agree, then I imagine the others will do their best to accommodate them (like the changes to Lisbon for Ireland), but I imagine there'd be a limit to their patience. 

I'm pretty sure that if Ireland had rejected the amended treaty too, the rest would simply have proceeded and left Ireland behind or outside the EU. I think that's perfectly reasonable, one country shouldn't be able to keep a continent back.

If we could reduce the use of bags, paper or plastic, altogether by introducing a price fee on them I agree it would be beneficial in terms of reducing our carbon footprint, if that at the same time would encourage people to use cotton-cloth bags more, or exclusively.

I fear, though, that that won't happen. I fear you're an exception to the rule: most people don't reuse bags that much and in that case encouraging people to reuse the plastic bags as much as possible is more beneficial than forcing people to switch.

The rise in price is somewhat ambiguous on one point a charge on plastic bags might reduce the use of them, but on the other hand people still have to get their stuff back from the supermarket. I don't have anything to back this up, but I suspect the price on plastic bags has a somewhat high elasticity, in which case the price won't affect the use.

You didn't answer my question. How many trillions more in credit? 


Also, this is credit given by (for example) the German people towards the Greek people, or by the Finns towards the Portuguese. Why should they pay for their problems?

Actually it is, but maybe not with regards to the inflation, but for example, the ECB should *not* help individual countries (which it has on several occasions.). The Target 2 credits which now is up to a trillion is questionable to say the least.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; No, it is the construction of the Euro. Otherwise, I'd like you to post evidence. 

I think you misunderstand. You asked why a country having a disproportionate surplus is wrong and I referred you to the failings of merchantilism. Now, as you correctly say, the construction of the euro has no mechanism to deal with huge surpluses. It does have an inflation target and you're right that it might not be enough but Germany ignored that rule anyway. If it had not, then things would not be quite so bad. 

&gt; Seriously, you have been discussing this for ages. Are you still unaware that this is the consequences of the badly constructed Euro?? Had it been correctly constructed this would not have happened. Are you that ignorant about currency unions? So, what you are saying, it doesn't matter how the Euro is constructed, it is merchantilism. I am getting tired of you, if you want to discuss it, go home and read up about currency unions. 

We're essentially saying the same thing, so I'm not sure why you're so angry. The fault of the way eurozone was constructed is exactly that it doesn't deal with trade imbalances properly, thus allowing countries to go into a merchantilistic trip. There is no discrepancy between the things we're saying. 

&gt; I have never said that there is no alternative. I've hated the Euro since the start and told Greece to leave since forever. And I would like to hear you solution, in detail, please. You are saying leaving or a transfer union. Well, if the transfer union is not happening and you are not leaving, what is your solution then? 

Um, as I have said a ton of times (and I'm pretty offended that you forgot or pretend you forgot) if the Eurozone does not implement something akin to a transfer mechanism, we should just dissolve it before things get too bad for everyone. 

&gt; Seriously, stop being ignorant. By know I am pretty sure you know more about currency unions than this. They are not producing stuff and you are suffering because of it. Claiming that is just ignorant. This is the consequences of an idiotic currency union.

Again, there is no real conflict between what you said and what I said. The fault of the currency union is that it doesn't help the uncompetitive areas and that it doesn't stop the competitive ones from abusing their competitive advantage. 

&gt; However, they are not producing stuff built upon the tears of Greek children slave labourers or something which guys like you seem to love to indicate. 

They don't build stuff ""upon the tears of Greek children slave labourers"" but the Germany's mindframe, i.e. export as much as possible, import as little as possible"" is creating the conditions for poverty everywhere else. 

&gt; I don't believe you, you have proved just in this answer that you blame them. You blame merchantilism, the fact that they don't hand over more moneywithout any demands etc. Well, I am blaming you for knowingly entering a fucked up currency union and then whining about it. Leave then. 

Oh, I don't mind demands, as long as they're to the benefit of everyone. The demands made now are made to the benefit of the creditor countries. What I want is a system that helps everyone. What I got is a system of predator lenders benefiting at the expense of their debtors. 

And I'm obviously recognising in retrospect that Greece's decision to join the euro was the wrong one. And as I said above, I think Greece should leave unless the eurozone is reformed ASAP.

&gt; I vividly remember Sweden's referendum about the Euro in 2003 and a lot of the discussions centered around a badly constructed Euro, which is also why they managed to get quite a few prominent economists on the No side.

If only Greece was as democratic country as Sweden with an open and honest debate about it, then things wouldn't have come to this.  But it isn't, the decision was made behind closed doors, the pros and cons were not discussed and there definitely was no referendum. 

I envy Swedes for this but the fact of the matter is Greece has not progressed to that point.

&gt; Yet, instead of saying ""We fucked up"", you blame Germany. 

But Germany is currently the ones that are stopping the necessary reforms to fix the euro's deficiencies. It makes sense to tell them something about it, does it not? We should say both: ""We fucked up"" is true. ""Germany should stop resisting eurozone reform"" is also true. It doesn't need to be one or the other, it can be both. 

&gt; I am so tired of you just trying to blame everyone, but not taking any responsibility. 

Every time we discuss this, you make the same claim. The fact that I'm criticising Germany's faults does not mean I don't accept fault on the part of anyone else. That would be ridiculous. 

&gt; And, you have not answered the question about how it should have been done differenty, I want a detailed answer.

I've given you a ton of possibilities already: The ""creditor"" countries raising wages, their supluses used as investment for the ""periphery"" economies, eurobonds, european investment bank issuing its own bonds and funding periphery economies, ECB allowing higher inflation etc. The sky is the limit...

&gt; Well, blame you elite then, not Germany? They have done what the Euro says. 

No, they haven't. They have:

1. Ignored the inflation target.
2. Ignored the deficit target.
3. Are resisting changes to fix the eurozone.

&gt; the only ting they have done outside of the treaty and the conditions is to help you.

You seriously believe the bailouts have helped? When someone is seriously indebted, you force him to take more loans and then also do austerity which limits his ability to pay back all the loans? That is the opposite of helping...

&gt; I think you should leave to. It would mean a whole lot of problem yes, but things aren't changing here and you'd have your destiny in you own hands. I do not like the Euro, and think it would be better for Greece to be outside. 

That's true. But we can't turn back the clock. Greece is now inside the Eurozone and an exit would be pretty catastrophic.

The ECB can not change its own policy. It can be done, but then it has to go through the proper channels and it will take years, decades. I bet all countries have to say yes, and if I were a northern country I would fight to keep the inflation goal. So no, it will not happen in a decade at least.

One thing I would definitely like to mention is the way these different forms of schools (Haupt-, Realschule and Gymnasium) are perceived.

I actually started out in a Hauptschule. That is where students are sent to who are not thought to be qualified enough for Realschule or Gymnasium. This decision is made for you at the age of 11/12 after fourth year of elementary. Your parents, of course, have free choice to send you wherever they want to send you to but if the student can't handle it, he gets sent somewhere else. 

Growing up as a boy, I've always thought of myself as very intelligent and curious. I was totally ignorant of my obvious language problems and lack of discipline. So, when I was evaluated to be of Hauptschule-Quality, it was demeaning and demoralising. I don't wanna appear overly dramatic but you have to understand the impact something like this could have on a boy who cannot imagine the ramifications of such an evaluation.

Now, there I am in a Hauptschule with some really bright and cool kids and some of the worst delinquents put together into one class. I have no  idea what I could hope to achieve once in my life because those people you admire and want to emulate don't happen to have graduated from a Hauptschule. 

To bring this to a close...there is some stigma to not going to a Gymnasium. I remember how someone must have put it in a chat right when Internet started to become popular and I was still in a Hauptschule, ""Hauptschule is for idiots, Gymnasium for nerds and Realschule for normal people"".

I live in Sweden now, and I always feel a pinch of shame when I see children watching subtitled animated movies on an iPad in the subway, or just speaking English with each other for fun (yes, for fun, none of the French children/teenagers I know would have any fun speaking English).

In 1947 there was a new law in France stating that any foreign movie had to be dubbed (even though there were still available in original version in some small specialized movie theaters). At least, now, in any relatively big cities there is the possibility to watch the movies in original version at the cinema (even small cinema will at least have a day in the week when the original version is displayed).

But just a few years ago, in my home town, and in the towns close-by, we were force to see the movies dubbed. Same went for TV programs. Now that TV comes through internet, it is sometimes possible to switch the language of a show. Before having DVDs, we had to deal with VHS that were only available in French (and I think that our VHS players wouldn't support American format, so we couldn't even order and original version VHS). Also, I'll add that if the original version is not available on the channel where a show is displayed, then there is no way to get it legally because solutions like Netflix are unavailable in France due to another stupid law. You'll have to wait for the dvd.

Sadly many French adults are now used to have dubbed movies / tv series. I am 25, and as much as I would like to say that all my friends prefer original versions, I have to admit that it is not true. I think that most of my acquaintances prefer original versions (some of them would refuse watching a dubbed show, saying that it sucks), but I also know many people who prefer french version (saying that they don't go to the cinema to read, or that they can't understand what's happening because it goes to fast and they can't focus on the plot and get who is who).

That's what tipped the budgets of the states. In addition, the slowdown of financial transactions due to mistrust among bankers and financial institutions wrecked credit availability. So at that point you have a combination of mistrust + credit crunch + govt spending cuts = instant crisis.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; When laws are written against the will or against the interests of the people, then it is their most basic right and duty to oppose them.

A) Yes, and in a demcratic framework one does it thought democratic channels. We have a democratic framework, use it then. One do not just ""change the rules for the ECB through the back door,"" one does it the right way.  

B) What people? Are the Greeks more people than the Finns or the Germans? What about the Poles or the Swedes. And, still no reason not to go through the proper democratic channels. 



&gt;Also the ECB can and does directly buy state bonds so it is not a clear-cut as you make it look. 

And they shouldn't do it to help individual countries, they have broken the law there for example when they helped out Italy. I think the ECB is a disgrace for doing that. 

&gt;I personally think we crossed the line when the Lisbon treaty was ratified by the French parliament despite the ""No"" of the 2005 referendum. Can you really still use the word democracy when the most basic expression of the will of the people is not respected?

So, why didn't the French oppose it more? And, perhaps, just a thought, perhaps that is one of the many reason LePen is gaining. There should be a punishment for ignoring the will of the people. Still, it is a problem of the French, not of the whole union although I think it was wrong obviously. 

They just have to follow statutes which are very much subject to interpretation.

I agree, but many people in this thread, and in Europe, have suggested that they should follow the rules even less, or ignore them. 


&gt;&gt;The ECB is probably the most undemocratic entity in the EU. Once appointed, the board members are unaccountable to any elected political bodies like the parliament. 


Also, they should not be subject to the parlament. That is the whole point of an independent central bank (or a Euro bank in this case). Sweden actually have one of the most independent national banks in the Western world, and we modelled it after the former Bundesbank (since we had a horrible problem when it wasn't independent, then our government just used our central banks as puppets, one of the reasons we had such a huge crises in the 90's, so we redid it). The Germans were forced into the Euro by the French (yes, Mitterand had it as a condition for the reunification) and they did *not* want to give up the D-mark. However, forced into it, they had to demands - it should be modelled after Bundesbank (independent and low inflation) and be in Frankfurt. 

In fact, not having an independent central bank can lead to all sorts of problem, just ask Sweden, or why not other countries who were subject to constant devaluations. 

So, I do not agree with you there, the ECB *should* be independent. In fact, I shudder to think what would happen were it not. Southern Europe outnumbers northern Europe and they would just vote to continue to do what they always have done - high inflation, high interest, instead of dealing with their problem 

God, the more I dive into the Euro problems, the happier I am that we are outside of it...

I bet it's strange when you're not used to it but, *hey*, I thought it was totally weird when I found out that there are countries where they dubbed something that's not for kids - it was kinda terrifying when I once stumbled on Grey's Anatomy with Italian dubbing. I remember my first thought was, *Jesus Christ that shit's terrible...* :D

as to our version I think it beats dubbing any day, you can hear the actors' voices, their tone, the emotions and you understand even if you don't speak the language - most lectors have voices that blend pretty well. there's one I can't stand but others are really good. actually some of them have somewhat cult status right now. I've seen a documentary on them once on youtube. pretty awesome to see faces behind the voices. there's one lady [ladies in this business are rare] that's always linked to documentaries on nature, she has a reaaaly steaaady monoootonous voice - it's a running joke around here to compare various boring events to her performance.

but there are also some pretty awesome ones - I guess which one you choose is a matter of personal taste - I always liked the guy who read *Columbo*, to the point that I'd be skimming through channels and then I heard some random fragment of some random movie and I'm like *oh, that's this guy, ok let's listen* but as you get involved into a movie you stopped notice the lector, but you'll recognize the voice right away if you hear it in some different setting - an add or sth. brain's a fun thing!

and last but not least - once you get your language skills to the level when you understand the actors - you'll hate every lector. but that's due to poor/incomplete translations. seriously - it drives me crazy when actor has some long intresting line and here comes the lector with some simplified shit that's not correct nor funny. *ugh.*

I bet the majority if not all of Polish redditors here can hear the voice in their heads when they read: *Czytał Tomasz Knapik*. ;D

**EDIT:** also, I have to state this - Polish dubbing of Disney's animation and similar is absolutely awesome, especially songs. there's the whole community on youtube that indulge in watching those vids/songs in different languages with English subtitles and compare voices, lyrics, meaning - which are different in every version.

I think French dubbing often don't really make sense.

Another example is how dubbing deals with a character being French in a show. In the French version of Lost, Danielle Rousseau is German even though she has a French name and writes in French. Jokes and puns often disappear, and accents also (Chase's Australian accent in House for instance)

Even the best dubbing in the world still diminish a lot the work of the actors, scenarists, and directors.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;You keep repeating that the Euro ""caused"" the crisis, but never detail how and why. Why don't you provide your reasoning and sources? In other words, make ""the Euro caused the crisis"" a disprovable claim.

Wow, you honestly do not know this? Well, no surprise for our discussion then. It will be a long read, but I hope you can bear with me and read it, because I really think it is a problem that people do not understand this. Btw, what I am saying is not something strange,this is what 90 % of the economists are saying, read the comments at r/economics. 


There is something called the optimal currency union area, and basically, the Euro is the opposite of it. You can read more about it  [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area).I also mentioned internal devaluation which you can read about [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_devaluation). 

You can compare it to (loosely of course, this is not the natural sciences, but a social science, there are not perfect comparisons) to when DDR and the BRD became one. From a currency union perspective, they were two different currencies, becoming one.


 DDR however, immediately got into huge problem. First, what they produced become more expensive, so they became less competitive. Second, if they produced similar products to BRD (like say wheat), it didn't work either, because they were less productive. Since they produced let us say 1 unit wheat for 1 D-mark in one hour, while the BRD produced 2 units wheat for 1 D-mark in one hour - how could the DDR compete? To increase productivity? Well, yes, but that takes time, years and decades to be exakt. So, the only thing they could change, since they now had the same currency was the salary. So, instead of producing 1 wheat for 1 D-mark, instead they produced 1 wheat for 0,5 D-mark. Then they could compete again. This is called internal devaluation and that is what southern Europe is suffering from right now. They can not (instantly) become more productive, nor can they like before change the interest rate/currency, so they use the only mean they have at their disposal, pushing down salaries. It is really Economics 101 . 


So, in short,mass unemployment follows in the wake of this. However, Wet Germany lessend this by making sure DDR had all their social needs taken care of (schools, hospitals, pensions and social benefits) plus huge investments to make them become more productive and lessen the mass unemployment. Plus, the DDR didn't have to worry about keeping their banks going, or any debt. However,that obviously costed BRD trillions (and still do btw). 

Now, compare this to the Euro area. More players, but same idea. The internal devaluation is happening, full scale in southern Europe. However, they have no one to take care of their social needs, their debt, or their banks. That is why the Euro is such an enormous shitty currency. Monetary integration, without social and financial integration. And, the reason this is happening to southern  Europe and not to Finland, is that Finland had an economy that was competitive with the Euro.  Also, this is the base for the problem. No banks is the world can make southern Europe competitive, or lend them enough  money to keep them in the manner which they were accustomed to. 

Add, to add to the problems, the southern Euro countries when they joined the Euro, go much cheaper credit all of a sudden, which made them go insane and borrow to much.  Instead of the normal 6 % interest rate, they got 2 % (for example). It was not stupid of the banks to lend to those countries  - the banks had dutifuly charged them more before, but now, they were Euro countries, the risk had gone down- or so both the banks *and* the countries thought. However, we both know that it is not the case. 

For a while the countries could cover up their lack in competitiveness with increased spending, but when the market crashed in 2008 it showed which economies that were reliable and which were built on sand. That is also why the banks are not the cause (but a huge symptom) of the Euro crises. Understand me correctly, the banks are no angels, but they are not the ones who caused nor can they fix southern Europes lack of competitiveness. And, if it were all the banks faults, the symptoms should be equal, which they are not. 

So, to fix southern Europe, one has to fix the Euro. I do not think it can (or should actually) be done, so I think, and have always said, that they should quit the Euro. 

And, to make you even angrier - people know that the Euro is a horrible currency, and they have always known it. The countries who joined it knew it, but everyone had a a ""kick the can down the road"" attitude about it. The ones who designed it knew it too. 

And, everyone knows how to fix it too, but no one want to. Me neither to be honest. ",0,1383752679,null,0,false,0,cd82wdn,t3_1q0k5x,t1_cd82wdn,t1_cd81n3m,null,1428768525,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,Jackopo,null,null,"&gt;Secondo te quello che hai è un handicap, un vantaggio (meno fastidi) o una cosa completamente neutrale?

Abbastanza neutrale, la maggior parte delle giornate non ci penso nemmeno, quando vedo gente che fa le smorfie per la puzza lo apprezzo ma in alcuni casi (tipo quando ho la paranoia di puzzare, o quando si parla di caffè o altri alimenti con aromi particolari) mi dispiace

&gt;Cos'è per te l'odore? Secondo te l'olfatto è una cosa molto importante per il genere umano? Cosa pensi succederebbe se fossimo tutti anosmici?

Penso che esclusi alcuni casi particolari (es. i chimici o chi lavora col cibo) l'olfatto sia superfluo, se non ci fosse non cambierebbe praticamente nulla.
Mi immagino l'olfatto come una sensazione simile al caldo o al freddo che sento quando inalo l'aria, da piccolo pensavo che coincidesse con la temperatura dell'aria respirata.

&gt;Sei favorevole al matrimonio tra gay? E tra anosmici? E tra gay e osmici? E tra Berlusconi, Belen e gay anosmici?

Mah, guarda, io ho vari amici anosmici e li rispetto per le loro scelte, ma non devono venire a fare gli anosmici davanti a me, che mi fa anche un po' schifo, non ci sto al pensiero unico imposto dalla lobby degli anosmici che vuole rendere illegale l'olfatto.
Sono favorevole al matrimonio e all'adozione per qualsiasi coppia, incidentalmente potrei usufruirne io stesso.

Despite the revolution we don't have a strong democratic culture in France and never evolved very far beyond the absolute monarchy. If the president says something must be done, then it is done.

Back to the point ... I don't see why the central bank should be independent. Money is a tool which should be used to apply policies decided on a political level, not dogmatic rules with no proven basis. I can't speak for other countries, but monetary power was in the hands of the French government from 1945 to 1972 and those were the best 30 years in recent history. Now we hear that if governments had the power to create money they would abuse it to no end, but it was clearly not the case. On the other hand we gave this power to the banks and they did abuse it greatly.

Inflation is not that bad. It is an incentive to spend money quickly so it boosts economy. It really only hurts those who have a lot of money. You probably should fear deflation more.

1) The report reviews several alternative fiscal strategies to reduce public debt. It isn't particularly directed to the EU or the Eurozone.

2) This particular proposal is just one of several options reviewed in the report. Namely, the last one (p. 49, ""Box Nr. 6""). It notes that it has been done before, in Europe and Japan, before and after WWII.

3) It isn't a haircut on savings accounts, but a capital tax on all wealth. Taking your money out of the bank wouldn't get you off the hook.

4) It doesn't defend a 10% rate, but merely notes that, for a ""sample of 15 Eurozone countries"" a 10% rate would be needed to bring the public debt back to pre-crisis levels. They see such a rate as ""sizable"" (euphemism  for ""scary"").

So, much ado for nothing, and yet another example of terrible journalism at work.

EDIT: The actual words of the IMF economists:

*The sharp deterioration of the public finances in many countries has revived interest in a “capital levy”— a one-off tax on private wealth—as an exceptional measure to restore debt sustainability. The appeal is that such a tax, if it is implemented before avoidance is possible and there is a belief that it will never be
repeated, does not distort behavior (and may be seen by some as fair). There have been illustrious supporters, including Pigou, Ricardo, Schumpeter, and—until he changed his mind—Keynes. The conditions for success are strong, but also need to be weighed against the risks of the alternatives, which include repudiating public debt or inflating it away (these, in turn, are a particular form of wealth tax—on bondholders—that also falls on nonresidents).*

*There is a surprisingly large amount of experience to draw on, as such levies were widely adopted in Europe after World War I and in Germany and Japan after World War II. Reviewed in Eichengreen (1990), this experience suggests that more notable than any loss of credibility was a simple failure to achieve debt reduction, largely because the delay in introduction gave space for extensive avoidance and capital flight—in turn spurring inflation.*

*The tax rates needed to bring down public debt to precrisis levels, moreover, are sizable: reducing debt ratios to end-2007 levels would require (for a sample of 15 euro area countries) a tax rate of about 10 percent on households with positive net wealth.*

true,nychipshot,null,null,"Paywalled- here's the text: 

The criticisms that hurt are those one suspects might be fair. This might explain the outrage from Berlin last week over the criticism by the US Treasury of Germany’s huge and vaunted trade surplus. But the Treasury is to be commended for stating what Germany’s partners dare not: “Germany has maintained a large current account surplus throughout the euro area financial crisis.” This “hampered rebalancing” for other eurozone countries and created “a deflationary bias for the euro area, as well as for the world economy”. The International Monetary Fund has expressed similar worries.

The German finance ministry responded that its current account surplus was “no cause for concern, neither for Germany, nor for the eurozone, or the global economy”. Indeed, a spokesman stated that the country “contributes significantly to global growth through exports and the import of components for finished products”. This reaction is as predictable as it is wrong. The surplus, forecast by the IMF at $215bn this year (virtually the same as China’s) is indeed a big issue, above all for the future of the eurozone.

Export surpluses do not reflect merely competitiveness but also an excess of output over spending. Surplus countries import the demand they do not generate internally. When global demand is buoyant, this need not be a problem provided the money borrowed by deficit countries is invested in activities that can subsequently service the debts they are incurring. Alas, this does not happen often, partly because the deficit countries are pushed by the supply of cheap imports from surplus countries towards investing in non-tradeable activities, which do not support the servicing of international debts. But in current conditions, when short-term official interest rates are close to zero and demand is chronically deficient across the globe, the import of demand by the surplus country is a “beggar-my-neighbour” policy: it exacerbates this global economic weakness.

It is no surprise, therefore, that in the second quarter of 2013 the eurozone’s gross domestic product was 3.1 per cent below its pre-crisis peak and 1.1 per cent lower than two years before. Its highly creditworthy core economy is subtracting demand, not adding to it. Not surprisingly, the eurozone is also stumbling towards deflation: the latest measure of year-on-year core inflation was 0.8 per cent. Since demand is so weak, inflation may well fall further. This not only risks pushing the eurozone into a Japanese deflationary trap but thwarts the necessary shifts in competitiveness across the eurozone. The crisis-hit countries are being forced to accept outright deflation. This makes ultra-high unemployment inescapable. It also raises the real value of debt. (See charts.)

The policies pursued by the eurozone, under German direction, were certain to have this outcome, given the demand-destroying impact of the all-round fiscal austerity. In a recent paper for the European Commission, Jan In ‘t Veld argues that contractionary fiscal policy has imposed cumulative losses of output equal to 18 per cent of annual GDP in Greece, 9.7 per cent in Spain, 9.1 per cent in France, 8.4 per cent in Ireland and even 8.1 per cent in Germany, between 2011 and 2013. Inevitably, monetary policy is going to find it almost impossible to offset this. Before the crisis, it could work by expanding credit in what turned into the crisis-hit countries – above all, in Spain. Today, it is working against the background of a weak banking system, debt overhangs in crisis-hit countries and an aversion to borrowing in creditor countries.

The most likely way that a more aggressive monetary policy would be effective is by depreciating the euro’s exchange rate. If, for example, the ECB were to undertake large-scale quantitative easing, by buying the bonds of the members in proportion to their shares in the central bank, a falling euro would be the most likely result. But that would exacerbate the tendency of the eurozone, operating under German influence, to force its adjustment on the rest of the world.

As the vulnerable countries shrink their external deficits, while the chief creditor country remains in surplus, the eurozone is generating huge external surpluses: the shift from deficit towards surplus is forecast by the IMF to be 3.3 per cent of eurozone GDP between 2008 and 2015. Given the shortfall demand in the eurozone, the shift might need to be even larger, at least if the vulnerable nations are to have much chance of cutting unemployment. This is a beggar-my-neighbour policy for the world. The US has every right to complain about it, just as others had a right to complain about past US regulatory failures.

It will be impossible, however, for the eurozone to achieve prosperity on the basis of export-led growth: it is too large to do so. It has to achieve internal rebalancing, as well. Hitherto, as the IMF’s October World Economic Outlook shows, it is mass shedding of labour that has raised competitiveness, and collapsing domestic demand that has reduced external deficits in the crisis-hit countries. Thus the adjustment successes have been the other side of the coin of economic slumps and soaring unemployment. Yet, even so, the IMF does not forecast significant reductions in net liability positions. Their vulnerability will endure.

So what, in brief, is happening? The answers are: creeping onset of deflation; mass joblessness; thwarted internal rebalancing and over-reliance on external demand. Yet all this is regarded as acceptable, desirable, even moral – indeed, a success. Why? The explanation is myths: the crisis was due to fiscal malfeasance instead of to irresponsible cross-border credit flows; fiscal policy has no role in managing demand; central bank purchases of government bonds are a step towards hyperinflation; and competitiveness determines external surpluses, not the balance between supply and insufficient demand.

These myths are not harmless – for the eurozone or the world. On the contrary, they risk either trapping weaker member countries in semi-permanent depressions or leading, in the end, to an agonising break-up of the currency union itself. Either way, the European project would come to stand not for prosperity, but for poverty; not for partnership, but for pain.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;don't see why the central bank should be independent.

You are kidding me, right? Well, how about if I give you Mugabe/Zambia  as an extreme example of a non independent bank? Or, why not Sweden in the 70's. Due to our taxes, more and more companies moved, and producing became more and more expensive which raised the prices for Swedish goods. However, instead of dealing with the underlying issues, the government just devaluated the crown the whole time. That made things cheaper for a while, but never dealt with the underlying issues.  Cue to the massive Swedish financial crises in the early 90's with high unemployment, the krona lost 25  % *overnight* etc. After that Sweden decided - never again. We will have a national banks that defends our currency and keep it stable and who defends our economy. What is wrong with that? It all depends on the goals you give them. The ECB main goal is inflation, but that does not have to be the case. Look at the Fed, Japans national bank or Bank of England. They have a much broader assigment from their parlament. 

The independent part is to assure that for example southern Europe do *not* do a Sweden and devaluates the currency instead of dealing with the underlying issues. Looking at it now, it would have been nice if they had done that, dealt with the issues, wouldn't it? 

So, why do you hate independent central banks? 

&gt;I can't speak for other countries, but monetary power was in the hands of the French government from 1945 to 1972

Those were probably, together with the 80's and early 2000's the best years for everyone, everywhere in the Western World. I think we will never see such growth again. Frankly, it would have been hard to fuck that up. 


Also, because an independent banks gives more faith in the country and in the currency and is not used as political tool. by individual parties.That is essential for a healthy business climate. What sort of business climate do you see if first the interest rate is manipulated to serve the socialists, two years later the right wings win and they change it again. How do you think such insecurity affects the business climate? Faith in the country and the currency? Furthermore - that means that you have to defend your currency at all costs, and not have it tied to anything. That can be good or bad, but also extremely costly. We have a free floating one, which means that we do not have to spend money defending it - we learned that lesson to. 


&gt;Inflation is not that bad.

I am not sayin that it is, and having an independent bank doesn't mean that you can have a higher inflation target. Look at Bank of England or the Fed, they are  not as afraid of inflation as the Eurozone (or Swedes for that matter), which is evident in how they have handled the crises. Still, they are and should be independent. I don't know why you say that all a independent bank could fight for is inflation.

true,painlord2k,null,null,"La mancanza di un controllo centrale è una caratteristica voluta di Bitcoin.
Questo proprio per evitare che un potere centrale manipoli la moneta a comodo suo.
Il motivo per cui esiste l'inflazione nel nostro sistema monetario ($,€, etc.) è che le banche centrali possono stampare tutta la valuta che vogliono e usarla come gli pare. Stampare valuta e prestarla serve a redistribuire il potere di acquisto da chi produce a chi riceve i la nuova valuta (normalmente le banche, lo stato, e gli amici degli amici). 
Stampare nuova valuta riduce il tasso di interesse di mercato e riduce il llivello di risparmio: la gente capisce (anche a livello inconscio) che i suoi risparmi vengono svalutatati e quindi preferisce razionalmente consumare il più possibile e risparmiare il meno possibile e indebitarsi.
Solo che la scelta razionale dei singoli ha effetti nefasti se tutti la applicano, perché non è possibile che tutti siamo in debito se nessuno risparmia.

La recessione attuale è la conseguenza dell'eccesso di creazione monetaria del passato e la stanno curando con altra creazione monetaria, che causerà una peggiore recessione in futuro.

Con il Bitcoin questa cosa non succede. Se hai un bitcoin, anche se a breve termine il prezzo può salire o scendere, a lungo termine può solo salire, perché la quantità di monete create è limitata. Ergo i tuoi risparmi non possono perdere valore a causa di un banchiere centrale o di un governo di disgraziati.

Se i governi vietassero il bitcoin sarebbe solo la prova che ci vogliono tenere dentro la loro personale prigione valutaria: questo non renderebbe il bitcoin meno desiderabile, ma più desiderabile.

I assume that since OP is studying there that they can speak German, but this point is HUGE. Even if you can't speak the language, try a few phrases. Even making an effort to use simple greetings (Guten morgen, Danke, bitte, etc.) goes a long way and will put most people at ease, especially since Americans are famous for not being bilingual.

Even if you do speak the language, the Germans will still want to practice their English with you. Let them, but only answer in German, so you can practice too. I found that after I did this for a while, people forgot and just switched back to speaking German. 

Germans are great people once you get to know them, and speaking their native tongue helps the process immensely. They are impressed by Americans (or any foreigners) who go to the effort to learn their language.

Yes, Mario Draghi for example. He went out and said they were going to defend Italy. I have a huge problem with that. 

&gt;Let me ask you a question: when someone in your country says ""the government should do Y"", do you immediately assume they mean it should be done without passing it through the parliament?

Because I am a realist. Honestly, I do *not* think we can rewrite the Maastricht treaty in decades. 

Just to start negotiating about it, would take, let us say five years. Then I can inform you that Sweden, Denmark and the UK would say no, for starters. And, do you honestly think that northern Europe will vote yes for permanent transfer for the south? Do you think the Finns will say ""Yes, I love those Portugese people. I will happily send 30 % of my GDP down south so we can make sure the Italians get their pensions and Portuguese their welfare while we cut back on ours?""

We have discussed this before. One can not save the Euro with half assed measures, and you know it. So, a) why are you even trying b) do you honestly think we can get a new treaty who will work for higher inflation, paying off higher debt and more transfers south? Do you belive anyone in the north would vote for that? 

So, when you write -we should have a new treaty, I can say, sure, but it will not happen (I'd vote no for one). I can also write ""We should not spy on each other"". Both have about just as big chance of happening .

So, do you honestly believe in a new treaty?

You can always find an extreme example of everything. It does not mean that it will always happen that way. I gave you a counterexample, and there are many others.

&gt; do not do a Sweden and devaluates the currency instead of dealing with the underlying issues

You proposed earlier that those countries should leave the Euro, the direct consequence would be immediate devaluation of their new national currencies with respect to the Euro. And it would be a big benefit for them as well! They do have numerous issues to deal with, and monetary control would be a valuable tool to help with this. As it is now budgetary measures imposed by the lenders have destroyed their economy. I'm sure you won't deny it. They will take maybe 20 years to recover. And all of this to repay interests to private lenders! People are dying because hospitals are underfunded and they can't be treated. Suicide rate has increased by 100% since before the crisis. Yet countries like yours and Germany insist that the reforms must go on, reducing the budget even more, removing aids and public services, as if the Greeks had to suffer like they had suffered. There is an alternative, we should at least give it a chance.

&gt; why do you hate independent central banks

Let's say that I have had a bad experience with a particular one in the last few years? Control is taken away from the people on too many levels. It is just part of the problem, though. I guess in Sweden you have good political institutions, so giving this away does not feel like much. France feels like a banana republic in comparison. 

&gt; I don't know why you say that all a independent bank could fight for is inflation.

true,einsiedler,null,null,"Meine Eltern sind ja auch Vermieter, und wir vermieten 4 Wohnungen. In Deutschland haben Vermieter leider sehr wenige Rechte und wenn man eine Wohnung vermietet, ist es im Prinzip eine Enteignung.

Aber dieses Gesetzt begrüße ich. In anderen Ländern gibt es das schon längst und es funktioniert. 
Die Provision wird am Anfang fällig und neue Mieter haben sowieso am Anfang viele Ausgaben. Die erste Monatsmiete, die Kaution (wir nehmen drei Nettomieten), Umzugsfirma und dann noch neue Anschaffungen für die Wohnung. 
Wir hatten zwei mal eine Wohnung mit Hilfe einer Maklers vermietet und beide male waren die Mieter überfordert, die Kaution/Miete vollständig und pünktlich zu zahlen. Hätten sie zuvor nicht den Makler mehr als 1000 Euro zahlen müssen, wäre es sicherlich einfacher verlaufen.
Viele Makler bemühen sich auch nicht, den richtigen Mieter für die Wohnung zu finden. Hauptsache, sie finden einen Mieter der die Provision gleich zahlt. In Großstädten mag es vielleicht anders laufen, durch die große Auswahl an Interessenten, aber in Vorstädten sind sie froh, einfach schnell mal ihre Provision zu bekommen und die Sache abzuschließen.

Vermieter mit wenig Erfahrungen können sich auch einfach an Vermieter-Vereine wenden und sich dort beraten lassen. Auch bei der Aufsetzung von Verträgen unterstützen sie. Der Makler, der unsere Wohnungen vermietet hatte, hatte unzählige Fehler im Mietvertrag gemacht und uns danach nur Probleme bereitet.

Und zum Argument, dass Vermieter die Provision der Makler dann einfach auf die Monatsmiete umlegen. 
Ich denke, dass es in den seltensten Fällen passiert. Eine Wohnung zu vermieten ist nicht so schwer und (vor allem kleine private) Vermieter würden sich eher scheuen, auf einen Schlag rund 1000-2000 Euro an Provision zu zahlen und dann lieber schnell selbst paar Bilder machen, ins Internet stellen und dann einfach mal zwei Tage in der Woche paar Stunden für Wohnungsbesichtigungen opfern. Ein Mietvertrag (plus Kopie) füllt man innerhalb von einer halben Stunde aus. 
Ein Vermieter, der den Mietpreis erhöhen würde, würde es auch sonst machen und trotzdem die Wohnung ohne Makler vermieten. Allein der Mietspiegel gibt nicht viel Spielraum, einfach mal 50 Euro mehr für die Wohnung wegen den jetzt zusätzlichen Maklerprovisionen zu verlangen.

""In a short interview on Granada Television's current affairs programme World in Action Pusztai said that rats fed the potatoes had stunted growth and a repressed immune system. This resulted in Pusztai and the Rowett Institute receiving numerous phone calls from government, industrial, NGO and media organisations. Following the media frenzy, Pusztai was suspended and misconduct procedures were used to seize his data and ban him from speaking publicly. His annual contract was not renewed. The Rowett Institute and the Royal Society reviewed Pusztai's work, concluding that the data did not support his conclusions. The data was published in the The Lancet in October 1999, and reported significant differences in the thickness of the gut epithelium of rats fed genetically modified potatoes (compared to those fed the control diet), but no differences in growth or immune system function were suggested. After publishing, it was criticised on the grounds that the unmodified potatoes were not a fair control diet, and that any rats fed only on potatoes will suffer from a protein deficiency. Pusztai responded to these criticisms by stating that all the diets had the same protein and energy content and that the food intake of all rats was the same.""

&gt;Explain, in detail please, why it is not possible to change the Maastricht treaty or the ECB charta.

Of course, I will after you answer my questions how it would be changed and what you will change! I have answered your questions, but you never answer mine. 

And, you do know that all countries have to vote yes to a new treaty. Or are you saying that you do not need a yes from all countries in the EU?

Russia? Won't do it, they have a vested interest in keeping the current regime in power.  
USA? Won't do it, their relationship with Russia is pretty bad in the first place and Russia can not back down when it comes to the US. Also their people is growing tired of wars being fought far away for not apparent reason and if they did people would assume it's about oil again.
China? Won't do it. They don't give a fuck about human rights at home, they don't give a fuck about human rights in North Korea and they most certainly don't give a fuck about human rights in Syria.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;You can always find an extreme example of everything. It does not mean that it will always happen that way. I gave you a counterexample, and there are many others.

And you ignore not only my argument of Sweden, but the many reasons I gave for having an independent central banks, like reliablity. 


&gt;You proposed earlier that those countries should leave the Euro, the direct consequence would be immediate devaluation of their new national currencies with respect to the Euro. And it would be a big benefit for them as well! 

This has nothing to do with the argiment of independent central banks. I don't know what you are trying to say actually. Yes, I suppose. 

&gt;devaluation of their new national currencies with respect to the Euro. And it would be a big benefit for them as well! They do have numerous issues to deal with, and monetary control would be a valuable tool to help with this. As it is now budgetary measures imposed by the lenders have destroyed their economy.

Which an independent bank would do better *in particular* in those countries. Do you trust the Greek goverment with a central bank? Or Berlusconi or someone like him? In particular in corrupt countries one *need* central banks. I mean, if Sweden, who is one of the least corrupt countries in the world had a problem with it, how on earth can you want a politically run central bank for countries who are far, far more corrupt, to say the least? 


&gt;As it is now budgetary measures imposed by the lenders have destroyed their economy.

No, the Euro has destroyed the economy, Don't you dare blame this on the IMF or the troijka. No,they have not helped, but anyone who has an inkling about optimal currency areas and internal devaluation knows that the destruction started way before. 

&gt; I'm sure you won't deny it.

I most certainly will! I will link you to this superlong answer I wrote to another user as to explain as to *why* the construction of the Euro is the fault, *not* the banks, *not* the troijka.

It is very long, but I hope you can read it. I find it important that people know these reasons which are well known among economist (I am not one, but I have read one year, and this is really basic Economics 101. If you don't believe me, head over to  r/economics, I hang out there sometimes).

[Link that explains internal devaluation](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1q0k5x/barroso_germany_must_stablilize_the_eurozone/cd82wdn).

&gt;Yet countries like yours 

No,we do not. Our finance minister has said that southern Europe should quit the Euro (or he specifically said Greece and Spain, probably not about Italy and I do not remember Portugal). I agree.

&gt; Germany insist that the reforms must go on, reducing the budget even more, removing aids and public services, as if the Greeks had to suffer like they had suffered. There is an alternative, we should at least give it a chance.

The alternitive is permanent transfers. How are you going to get those? 


&gt;Let's say that I have had a bad experience with a particular one in the last few years? Control is taken away from the people on too many levels. It is just part of the problem, though. I guess in Sweden you have good political institutions, so giving this away does not feel like much. France feels like a banana republic in comparison. 

But it is not the fault of the bank, it is due to the fact that the Euro is a fucked up currency, No central bank in the world can fix that, even if it has sex with Merkel and Hollande on a daily basis. (and I do not like that picture).

If you want to change the treaty so that countries should fly the EU flag once a year abot the normal flag - well you might get a yes. 


But, if you honestly think that 28 countries (in Sweden the Euro has an approval rate of 12 %, we have far, far more people who believe in ghosts) to reflect changes of a permanent transfer union, you will get a no. Not only will of course countries like Sweden, UK (honestly, how do you think Hollande will convince Cameron) and Denmark, but most northern countries will say no to. 


If you look at working currency unions and federations, there *needs* to be large perment transfers. Do you think any northern country would vote yes for large perment transfers to the south?

I don't think the EU should govern the economic affairs. We said no to that in a vote, and frankly, the EU sucks at it, plus we are an independet state, we have not agreed to hand over economic power to the EU. If there is a United States of Europe, we should be allowed to vote about it. We haven't so the EU should stay away from our finances.

true,gamberro,IREL,Éire,"With all due respect the rules as originally written did not take into account many factors. It was assumed initially that adhering to the rules found in the Stability and Growth Pact would mean that the Eurozone wouldn't need a fiscal actor or a lender of last resort. As we've seen since the crisis began, those assumptions were misguided. Here are two points to back this up:

* For example, [Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Irish_debt_and_EU_average.png) and [Spain](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Spanish_debt_and_EU_average.png), complied with budget and public debt limits in the first few years of the Euro before rescuing the banking sector led public debt to explode. So despite adhering to the rules for fiscal policy, the fact that the creation of the euro didn't include a banking regulator or a banking union means that both countries now have a severe sovereign debt crisis.
* Secondly, the ECB may be technically breaking its mandate by helping countries like Italy and Spain, but if it hadn't these countries would have had to make a disorderly exit from the Eurozone. Economists like [Paul De Grauwe](http://ideas.repec.org/p/ces/ceswps/_3821.html) have argued that the fact that the ECB doesn't officially act as a lender of last resort means that these countries have been effectively downgraded to third world countries who are dependent on winning the confidence of the markets by controlling their debt to GDP ratio. In the absence of a lender of last resort, the fears of the market can lead to liquidity crises turning into to solvency ones. So a European country like the UK which has a lender of last resort (the Bank of England) can have a significantly [higher debt](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/government-debt-to-gdp) than a country that doesn't like [Spain.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/government-debt-to-gdp)


Lastly, the rules shaping the Eurozone have already been amended since the crisis began and the Eurobond is just one proposal as to how to fix the problems. So far Eurozone leaders have adopted proposals in the fashion of the core countries with measures such as the Fiscal Compact. The latter enshrines in law the principle that member states' budgets must be either balanced or in surplus. However, I think what Barroso is arguing that that the agreements to ensure sound fiscal policy aren't enough enough.

On a final note, I highly recommend [this article](http://www.cer.org.uk/publications/archive/essay/2011/why-stricter-rules-threaten-eurozone) from the Centre for European Reform which spells out pretty clearly what core countries need to do (albeit from a pro-periphery perspective).",0,1383762808,null,0,1383779564,0,cd8786u,t3_1q0k5x,t1_cd8786u,t1_cd821c1,null,1428766490,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Mein Problem mit dem Schwarzen Block ist vor allem, dass eben dieser Unterschied, den du erwähnst, nicht mehr wirklich vorhanden ist. Die Ideologie des Schwarzen Blocks ist ebenfalls inhärent Gewalttätig und Menschenverachtend. Bei den Rechten haben wir Neo-Nazis und deren extrem den NSU. Bei den Linken haben wir den Schwarzen Block und die extreme Weiterführung die RAF.
Dem Schwarzen Block geht es nicht um ""die Sache"". Es geht ihm ums Spektakel. Um die zünftige Schlägerei. Mal so richtig wen zu verprügeln. Nur halt in diesem Fall nicht Ausländer, sondern ""Bullenschweine"" oder andere die es ""verdienen"".

In meinen Augen sind beide Seiten Verachtenswert.

Meine Argumentation richtet sich vor allem darauf, dass die Rechte Seite sich deutlich durch Anzahl und schwere der Straftaten abhebt. Und das sich die Frage stellt, warum Konservative Politiker so oft mit Begeisterung Rechte Gewalt verharmlosen und stattdessen die Gefahr von Links beschwören.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"I read (parts of)the pdf, thank you.And I agree in a way, rules do not help the Eurozone, really. 

I don't think stricter rules can save/shape up the Eurozone. But,however, just because one doesn't like the rules, one shouldn't ignore them, like with the debt/GDP. And, of course rules should/can be changed - but it has to be done through a democratic fashion, and through the proper channels. If one do not like the inflation goal of the ECB, well , change the statue. If one want a transfer union - well, change the treaty. 

&gt;Lastly, the rules shaping the Eurozone have already been amended since the crisis began and the Eurobond is just one proposal as to how to fix the problems.

The Eurozone is a mess because the economies are so different and they have no financial and social integration. To change that one *has* to change the treaty. And, it will be a no. Every single successful currency union has huge financial transfers. And, of course northern Europe will vote no to that. 

And, Eurobonds is a way of handing over southern debt to norhern shoulders, something the treaty specifically forbids, just like they forbid helping individual countries and bail outs. 

I think the Euro is a really badly constructed currency. It might work for northern Europe because they are on equal footing but it will not work with southern Europe. We see that now, how they are struggling with their internal devaluation. And, there are two ways to fix that. Either one creates a full fiscal union, a United States of Europe with all it entails,huge transfers, common politics etc. Like Germany. 

Or, the countries who are not competitive (or perhaps the competitive countries, one of the two) quit. 

Since alternative A would mean the end of the nation state and that for example Finland would send 40 % of the GDP south to make sure that Portugals health care was covered while simoultanesly cutting down on its own - well, lets just say no northern country would vote yes to that. In fact, I don't think any state would vote to end themselves, which a fully fledged union would mean. 

So,I belive in alternative B. At least the southern states would have their destiny in their hands, and have a chance to recover. 

To do as one does no, trudge on with a little change here, a little there, is just cruel. 

The Euro should never have been constructed the way it looks now, and everyone is paying the price for it. Better get out as soon as one can. ",0,1383766309,null,0,false,0,cd88s6i,t3_1q0k5x,t1_cd88s6i,t1_cd8786u,null,1428765766,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

So it was your argument, that GMOs can not be safe, because there are studies which conclude that they are not. I simply told you, that 0,2% of studies done on a subjet show harmful effects, and 99.8% of studies done on GMOs show that they are not harmful at all. That is usually below the accepted error treshold, 5% so according to the available studies GMOs can be considered safe. In this case the few papers which have found adverse effects of GMOs are prime examples of junk science, sloppy experiments from biased authors which fall apart if you look at them closely. I have read most of them and my opinion is, that they can not to be trusted. You know, I base my opinion on facts, as I know a thing or two about the field.

That's why I asked you if you have actually read the original papers or only have heard somewhere that they exist? You have not replied to this simple question since then. Why? My prediction is that in fact you have never read a scientific paper in your life, your knowledge of this does not go beyond the usual media bullshit. That's why I say, name-calling are not accepted arguments in the scientific world. But it's not the end of the world, you can simply repar this flaw, read the fucking papers which suggest GMOs are harmful, and try to understand what experiments they did, what results they got, and what conclusion they drew from them! Do not act like a hysterical eight-year old, act like a thinking man, and gather the facts! Let's say as a homework, read the Seralini et. al paper from 2012. It's free to access here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512005637

It's the crown jewel of the anti-GMO movement, you have surely read about it in the media. Please read the paper and tell me what you think! What experiments did they conduct? What data they got? What conclusions can be drawn from this? If you are interested in the topic, and want to know something about it, you have to work for knowledge.

Anyway, I know that I'm exaggerating in my previous comment, but so is Martin Wolf.

Germany *relies* on export and import, and it just so happens that German corporations are really damn good at import and export. What I'm trying to say is, that the idea of a monetary union was pretty much doomed to fail if there aren't any proper trade regulations to ensure that regions (yes, regions; as opposed to countries) that make more coin can share benefit with regions that don't. And the EU makes this unbelievably difficult. The austerity measures, which has become a scary go-to word, is actually trying to do just that, but unfortunately, everyone views it as a bad thing (despite the fact that people in Germany are actually more than willing to help their southern friends).

But at the same time everyone acts like we're trying to fucking take over Europe, or some shit. It's not fair.

Reesee Neesee Mr Man Sir Sir.

Makes zero sense until you chart it
               
                    Mas.         Fem.         Neut.          Plur
*Nominative:       R              E              S               E        
*Accusative:       N              E             S                E  
*Dative:            M              R              M               N

*Genitive:          S              R              S               R

So when you read across the rows, it looks like reesee neeese mr. man sir sir.

This chart shows you the proper endings for Der/Die/Das depending on the case. If it's a masculine word (e.g., der Apfel) in the nominative case, (__ Apfel ist rot), the article you're looking for is deR. In the accusative context (Ich habe __ Apfel), the corresponding article on the chart is deN. In the dative case (Mit __ Apfel), the corresponding article is deM. And in the genitive case (Ein Stück __ Apfels), the article you'll want is deS.

Repeat with feminine words (e.g., die Tür). Nominative, diE Tür. Accusative, diE Tür. Dative, deR Tür. Genitive, deR Tür. And so on and so forth.

Now, the endings for ""ein"" words (.e.g, mein, kein, dein, ein) go:

exee nexee mr. man sir sir.

Where your article endings go:

                   Masc.                    Fem.        N.       Plural
* Nominative:               X (no ending)         E            X           E
* Accusative:               N                         E            X           E
* Dative:                     M                         R           M           N
* Genitive:                  S                          R            S           R

And the same thing applies. If you have a neuter noun (e.g., das Messer) in the nominative, check the chart and see that there's no ending. Therefore, ""ein Messer."" If you're in the accusative case (Ich habe __ Messer), check the chart: again, no ending, so Ich habe ein Messer. Dative case, (mit ___ Messer), you'll want eineM. And in the genitive case, eineS MesserS. 

Plural works the same way. Nominative: MeinE Äpfel sind rot. Accusative: Ich habe deinE Äpfel aufgegessen. Dative: Es liegt neben meineN ÄpfelN. Genitive: Ein Stück meineR Äpfel.

1. Proxénète = Coupable (mais on s'en fout actuellement)
2. Prostituée = Victime
3. **Client = ni l'un ni l'autre**

On voudrait faire passer le truc à :

2. Victime = prostituée
3. Client = coupable

Le résultat : on a viré la mafia de l'équation. C'est l'inverse de ce qu'il faut faire.

Cette mesure ne servira à rien. Les punters iront sur internet et à la frontière. Et surtout, les victimes vont se cacher encore plus, et les réseaux qu'on pourrait déjà remonter aujourd'hui continuent d'exister. C'est le summum de l'hypocrisie cette mesure. En plus d'être inefficace.

Au passage, pourquoi on ne fait rien aujourd'hui ? Si les prostituées sont toutes victimes de mafias, il suffit de toutes les surveiller sans relâche, constamment et remonter ces réseaux. On sait déjà où elles sont. Comment les trouver, comment remonter un réseau.

Well because that's how modern media works today. Same in Germany: An underpaid intern at ""BILD"" reads a press release from some weirdo person/organisation, takes an article from foreign satirical paper for real news, mistranslates a normal foreign newspaper article or misunderstands a news-wire and creates an article with a big headline for their web page from it. Then ""Spiegel"" interns see that article on ""BILD""'s web site and copy &amp; paste it. To make it look like ""Spiegel"" is more intellectual, they add some fancy wording to it and maybe throw in a little content from wikipedia from something related. That article gets picked up by news agencies and then gets picked up by every other news outlet, who all either c&amp;p BILD, Spiegel or the release from the news outlet onto their web site. None of them has done any research, which would've cost only a couple of minutes of googleing.

Things have changed, a lot, though, I will come to that.)

Turkish nationalism is definitely on a freefall, parallel to the rest of the world (apart from European countries who often get their jimmies rustled because of immigration issues), and the people of mainland Turkey would be more positive about this than they would be 30 years ago. The problems occurred when Greece's dictatorship era (correct me if I'm wrong, I wrote a twenty page paper on the history of Turkish-Greek relations before, but it was a long time ago, this might not have happened at all.) collided with the almost-McCarthyist nationalism that weaved its way through the media to the people's minds. There was hatred and hatred only between the two nations back then. The Cyprus conflict was mostly this, the Greek cypriots wanted to join Greece, which meant complete assimilation of every Cypriot that didn't consider themselves to be Greek, which led to the massacres and the invasion of Northern Cyprus by the Turkish army. The extremely tense relationship between the Turks and the Greeks continued after this, and Cyprus was a place where Cypriots, who didn't have to consider themselves Greek or Turkish after all were forced to choose a side, literally (North-Turkish, South-Greek). The tension was way more intense in Cyprus, where the two sides of the island literally shared a border with landmines under the ground until a few years ago. 

What changed, then? The 20-page paper was mostly on this; and the conclusions I came to were these;

- Two men named İsmail Cem and George Papandreou (yes, that Papandreou, he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the late 90s.) They really tried to end this meaningless conflict, and they made a huge difference in the process. İsmail Cem passed away in 2007, he was one of the few people I completely believed in in politics, ever. Before them, the relations were almost nonexistent, and it was unintentionally hilarious as fuck. There was a diplomatic crisis about two uninhabited islands that were so insignificant that nobody was certain where they belonged on maps. Somebody from one side noticed this, and it seriously might have led to a war. More information [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imia/Kardak), please don't keep reading without reading the article. It is such a good summary of the entire problems and how unnecessary they were.

- The earthquakes in 1999. Two earthquakes with devastating consequences happened in the span of a month in Adapazarı, Turkey and Athens, Greece. In August, the earthquake which was so unfortunately in a densely populated place in Turkey, close to Marmara sea; took so many lives and created extreme paranoia against a possible earthquake everywhere. Anyways, after the earthquake Greece was the first country to send humanitarian aid. I have the stats in Turkish somewhere in my computer, but it was an incredible gesture from them. A month later, a smaller earthquake happens below Athens, but the center of the earthquake is very close to the ground, it had a larger effect than the Richter scale points to. 13 hours later, Turkish government sends humanitarian aid, and people queue to donate blood to be sent to Greece. I also have some photos of news articles about this, it's just fucktons of feels everywhere.

Welp, that's pretty much it. I hate our government passionately, and I participated actively in the Gezi Park protests; but I concur with some of their attempts to fix all this bullshit. They are terrible at doing it though. On an unrelated note, fuck them.

The idea behind the EU has never been to destroy Germany, but the EXACT OPPOSITE. 

I mean, damn, do you really want to know how fucking huge was the part of the european population who *literally* wanted to kill all germans and to destroy the political entity known under the name of Germany after ww2 ? 

Don't you know that you could still find old people today pretty much everywhere in Europe that would refuse to talk to you simply because you're german ? Do I need to remind you what your country did ? What your grandparents did ? 

France wanted to create the EU to avoid any other repetitions like WW2. They didn't want to make a Versailles bis ! Germany still existed after WW2 only because the US and the USSR didn't want to destroy Germany. But there actually were many plans to share post WW2 Germany's remnants between other europeans countries. Destroying Germany would have been incredibly easy after WW2, you can be sure that the population of pretty much all Europe would have been incredibly rejoiced by this idea.

But no. France did choose to forgive Germany, and to create an union that would be the assurance of a future peace.

So, seriously, just shut the fuck up, you're nearly indecent. How can you even think that France wanted to destroy Germany via the EU after what your country did 70 years ago ?
