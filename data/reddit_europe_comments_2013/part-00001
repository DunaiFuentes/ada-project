The issue should be seen from the EU more as an attempt to save the EU rather than Greece. Because if Greece collapses then we might have a domino effect leading to the collapse of the other southern EU members. It will cost less to the EU if it agrees today to zero the debt of Greece rather than continuing the bail-outs. This will allow Greece to focus on its development rather on never ending debt payments. And one must not forget the high interest rates of 4% that were imposed for the first bail-out. This is called usury. Fortunately, it was later corrected.



I have been saying this for the last year on Reddit and gotten downvoted every time. These  so called ""bail-outs"" are intentionaly named that way to give the false impression of ""bailing out"" a friend or ally. In fact the total opposite is true .. just like how modern governments are called ""democratic"" even though the opposite is true. It gives false impressions to easier manipulate the masses on an idea.

The truth is that these ""bail-outs"" are only bailing out the German and French banks who gambled wrong on greek debt. So now greeks have to live through years of hell so these piece of shit gamblers can get there money back..

Either way I see Greece leaving once Tsipiras wins next election which as far as I know is all but guaranteed to happen. THe greeks will vote anyone  who is against austerity and the EU and for going back to the Drachma to control out own destiny . . .

The hard truth is that this will be a NEVER-ENDING crisis, so even if Greece does everything it is asked . . and reforms there economy . . . there will be stability for 10-20 years but then another crisis will happen. then another and another.

It's not lack of sensibility, it's that it's always the same thing over and over again, I kinda have grown a bit immune to all our whining, we have it so good when compared to most of the world and yet we have to act as if we're waiting to be executed.

Dude, really? Who takes pleasure in that kind of shit?

&gt;In this instance, of course, it is quite a lot more questionable who deserves what.

Talking about society as a whole; if we deserve it, I dunno; if we had it coming, we sure did; everyone could predict that if the state was spending more than what it could levy through taxes, then the extra spending that wasn't covered was coming from loans.

The deficits today are the taxes of tomorrow, this is obvious, nobody can't spend that which he does not have, the most one can do is get into debt and delay the costs, which is what we did a lot of during the Socrates years. We built a lot of shit and didn't bother about the expense then, if it now comes back to haunt us, well, regret isn't of much use now, is it?

It wasn't and now we're dealing with this in a much worse situation, it's not optimal but it's not like we have much of a choice, we will all have to endure this and do our utmost to prevent this from happening in the future, the most we can do now is to handle this in the fairest and most efficient way possible, unfortunately we can't go back in time and prevent the debt which we're now paying for.",0,1357167270,null,0,false,0,c7pyd0h,t3_15tm66,t1_c7pyd0h,t1_c7pxkql,null,1430837011,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Se analizaron planes en la sede del Oberkommando der Wehrmacht con los responsables de la División Económica del Servicio de Inteligencia (IWI por sus siglas en alemán), sección que buscaba conocer el potencial industrial de los países enemigos.* 

*El doctor Ernest Bloch, quien comandaba a la IWI, revisó una lista para seleccionar quién viajaría a la República Mexicana. El responsable debería conocer muy bien tanto Latinoamérica como Norteamérica, hablar el idioma español e inglés y estar capacitado para el espionaje industrial. Después de analizar los expedientes, se inclinó por un militar que recién se había reintegrado a la milicia y en ese momento estaba como encargado de las operaciones de la IWI en Holanda, Bélgica y Francia.*

Dude, we're talking about the Greek government finances, if your government got into debt it's because it spent more than the taxes it could collect and had to loan money, don't blame it on the banks that loaned money to the Greek state, they weren't the ones asking for financing, blame your own state for decades having spent way more than what it had.

What mistakes? The fact that they loaned to Greece in the first place and now you don't want to pay them back? I'm sure they won't make that mistake so easily in the future, considering that your interest rates are enormous.

Good going, blame it all on the banks and tell them to fuck off. It's not like you need their financing to work as a state, or is it?

&gt;It's one thing to say that Greece needs to own up to its mistakes, but quite another to absolve everyone else of all responsibility.

Again, what are you paying for that you shouldn't, exactly? The interest rates of the loans of the Greek state?

&gt;Is it so hard to believe that an entity may have made mistakes but also be victimised?

To see why it's such an improper juxtaposition, you have to understand the sole reason behind the GDP growth in 2006-2008, and it's very simple, we have had an enormous and unsustainable property bubble, fueled by reckless credits from Nordic banks, it was bound to burst sooner or latter. 

For this reason, simply comparing the numbers of this short period of shaky growth to our current condition gives you wrong impression about the health of the economy. I want to remind you, that for example; Latvia's GDP in 2000 was about 8 billion dollars, today 28; Lithuania's in 2000, 11 billion, today 42. 

So, there's two most important factors we always have to consider to determine the actual financial situation in the Baltic. First, what is the long term trend, second, what is the new growth drift is based on. Is it an economy driven by strong exports, an internal consumption, or a new market bubble. 

Various economists, and I personally, think that Baltic are moving presently in the right direction, which is export driven economy, plus internal consumption. I can't say in this particular case of Latvia, but I am quite certain they are doing pretty much the same what Estonia and Lithuania is doing, artificially keeps wages low; increasing competitiveness; attracting more capital from abroad; exports goods, mostly to Russia, Sweden, Germany, Britain. In last year not only exports reached pre-crisis level, it actually surpassed it substantially.

4. I believe Turkish membership is being pushed by the UK and to a lesser extent the US because of considerations important to their national interests. For Britain this is putting the brakes on federalisation, for the US it is the anchoring of their geopolitically significant ally with the West.

You clearly have no idea how Ireland wound up in crisis to begin with. The transfer of bank debt to the Irish taxpayer and subsequent ""bailout"" due to the sudden ""surprising"" fact that nobody would lend to us afterward.

The debts of Anglo were never structurally critical 
to our economy. Anglo could have failed, gone through the normal channels of a failed business, it's unguarunteed investors would've had to take a hit and those responsible jailed. Instead, the ECB sent letters to our minister of finance, and it was decided that letting private debt spread to Europe's other privately owned banks was unacceptable, even though their orgy of credit availability (along with bad regulation) allowed Anglo to gamble on an ever growing property bubble (developers building unneeded poor quality housing in areas where it was never needed, many of these ghost estates now lie derelict).

And so the debt was made public, and money had to be borrowed to cover it. Money the Irish taxpayer is expected to pay back, for an institution that IS dead, wasnt crucial to our economy, and to save the overexposed banks of Europe.

Right now the money flows thusly.

Lent from Europe to Irish government (with interest attached), paid from Irish government to European banks (including interest assumed).

So we wouldve had a domestic recession too. We accept that. We accept our natural situation, that we elected crooks and swindlers and they built us a house of cards, but we do not agree with their solution.

Now your examples of Sweden, and some very important points. Firstly, currency- we're in the Euro, so we can't devalue or recapitalize that way, secondly, the size of our population and tax base excludes the possiblity that we can restructure our social system and fix this. Our public debt is now twice where it was 4 years ago and growing. The interest alone is enough to sustain brutal austerity budgets and spiralling social supports for years to come.

We accepted the 'European' solution because the promise was that if we played along and insulated the collapse of the banking system, we would have support, solidarity, instead of allowing the status quo, we would isolate the spread of debt contagion, and then the ECB would put into place protections to shoulder the cost on all the beneficiaries. The alternative is Iceland's solution, which has seen their economy recover, and preserved justice for the common man by punishing those bankers who caused the crisis.

The Irish people have nobody in our corner. We did not run a bad bank, nor were the majority on a binge of second homes and credit. Our leaders admit the injustice foisted upon us, but yet continue supplying the same solution- play nice and Europe will solve it.

Europe is happy to let us rot so long as we contain it and keep from rioting so uncivilizedly as the Greeks. Germany is happiest of all.

So as I said, you simply have some wrong assumptions and comparisons. Ireland's situation is unprecedented: the largest transfer of private debt in history.

Yes, right. 

This is not only a stupid idea, it's also a logical flaw :
Criminalizing acts doesn't make them disappears either, so let's not criminalizing crime.

There is a difference between ""opinions"" and ""hate speech"". Inciting peoples to kill gay, or jews or black because they are gay, jews or black, isn't an opinion, it's a call for murder, and I believe that it should be criminalized.

Trying to lower your excessive public spending will destroy the country? Really? How populist can you get?

&gt;This won't be good for anyone since a country in shambles won't pay anything to anyone, will be just like Greece.

If anything, to avoid being just like Greece we have to not do just that, they are the ones trying to renegotiate and trying to get a better deal when they're just not in a bargaining position.

We must commit to this and show everyone we're not Greece, that we can handle our debt and that it aren't in risk of letting it spiral out of control. Even better, what we should be doing is letting them know that we really don't need them in the first place and that we'd just as well be able to deal with our shit ourselves, it's not a great bluff but it would certainly put us in a better position with our lenders and them, if the time was necessary, we'd renegotiate a better deal, one which wouldn't even be compared to us now trying to renegotiate because we're telling them it's too much and we can't take it, that's admitting defeat and while things are difficult, if we did that they'd only get worse - and Greece is proof of this.

&gt;This is what needs to be done, and is the alternative and will happen, sooner or later, the only question is how bad will Portugal be when it is done.

That's your opinion, and far from proven.

&gt;Your complaint about employers being in one position (which I would like to point out is not necessarily a better or worse one - rather typically of a lefty you're coming up with your own unsubstantiated value judgement and applying it to everyone else) and employees being in another (again, not necessarily better or worse) is ultimately a complaint about property, a complaint which, when examined, should rightly be deemed quite inane.

Translated and summarized: ""you moronic communist!"".

&gt;To draw a limit on that (beyond ownership of other persons) is arbitrary...and therefore we don't need to pay attention to it. If you want people to be able to hold a claim to even the most basic things, like food in their stomachs, then you must accept that people can hold a claim to all sorts of other things.

There's no logical necessity to accept that. Unless you I am able to accept that both the needs of people and the means to provide for them are the result of arbitrary, circumstantial factors of varying malleability. It's inevitably that we respond to inconsistent circumstances with inconsistent behaviours.

&gt;Unless we're being physically attacked, stolen from, defrauded, threatened, or in some other way having our property violated, then we do always have the option not to partake.

Exactly. And the position of some people in the economic organisation allows them to threaten other people.

&gt;You're asking me to define ""person"", meaning that I've not given you a definition, and then in the next sentence criticizing me for a definition of ""person""?

Not explicitly giving a definition does not mean you're not using one implicitly.

&gt;Nothing I've said is gibberish...it's not that it doesn't make sense. It's that you cannot make sense of it.

""I can't possibly be wrong in any way, therefore anyone who disagrees with me must be a moron."" I just reflect your useless ""arbitrary and therefore irrational"" qualification. Which mostly is just a roundabout way to compliment yourself for your smartness.

&gt;Do I have you spooked? Do you not know how to reply to this?

As I said, that does not follow at all. See above.

&gt;Anyway, about a definition of ""person"". I don't have to give one.

You just don't give one because it would make clear that your (implicit) definition of person is arbitrary too. And would therefore be irrational, if you apply your own logic on your own assertions.

&gt;Oh yes, they're part of the market. I never contended otherwise!
My problem is that so long as they are a feature we do not have a free market.

**Weighed down by bureaucracy and suspicion of science, we seem determined to turn relative into absolute decline**

A “rational optimist” like me thinks the world will go on getting better for most people at a record rate, not because I have a temperamental or ideological bent to good cheer but because of the data. Poverty, hunger, population growth rates, inequality, and mortality from violence, disease and weather — all continue to plummet on a global scale.

But a global optimist can still be a regional pessimist. When asked what I am pessimistic about, I usually reply: bureaucracy and superstition. Using those two tools, we Europeans seem intent on making our future as bad as we can. Like mandarins at the court of the Ming emperors or viziers at the court of Abbasid caliphs, our masters seem determined to turn relative into absolute decline. It is entirely possible that ten years from now the world as a whole will be 50 per cent richer, but Europeans will be 50 per cent poorer.

Not that the world economy is a zero-sum game. It is a good thing if Africans and Latin Americans join Asians in getting richer at breakneck pace, as many now seem to be doing, even if we don’t join in: not only because want and misery are bad whoever they happen to, but also because if others grow productive and inventive they can supply us with valuable goods and services. Why should the development of new antibiotics or thorium nuclear power remain a burden exclusively on the shoulders of Western taxpayers?

Even so, relative decline can be painful. Spanish people are richer and live longer than when their silver-sated conquistador ancestors strutted the European stage, but I am sure it does not feel like it to an unemployed youth in Bilbao. Whatever happens, we Europeans will probably have to get used to watching Asians book the best restaurants and launch the biggest aircraft carriers in the years ahead.

Absolute decline is far more scary. If Europe cannot rediscover how to grow its economy, then it will have to default on its vast debts, either directly or by inflation. Either way savers will be poorer, tax receipts will be lower and spending on schools and hospitals and roads will be lower: genuine austerity.

As the MP Douglas Carswell reminds us in his book The End of Politics, here in Britain we have public and private debts that are five times our annual economic output; we are spending £46 out of every £100 we earn to buy government — a product that, unlike most, delivers less output for more cost each year. As the Ming empire found out, the more government you buy, the less economic activity you get. A Fujian travelling salesman in 1400 was enmeshed in such a tangled bureaucracy that he could neither travel nor sell without bribes and permits, and he had to submit a monthly inventory of his stocks to the emperor.

Sound familiar? Every small businessman I talk to these days has a horror story to tell about the delays and costs that have been visited upon him by planners, inspectors, officials and consultees. Using the excuse of “cuts”, the bureaucracy is taking even longer to make decisions than five years ago. In the time it has taken Britain’s Government to decide whether to allow a fifth exploratory shale gas well to be drilled in Lancashire, and from the same standing start, the same investors have drilled 72 producing wells in Argentina. That the country of Watt and Stephenson should look a potential cheap-energy gift horse in the mouth in this way is staggering to this jaded optimist.

From ancient Egypt to modern North Korea, always and everywhere, economic planning and control have caused stagnation; from ancient Phoenicia to modern Vietnam, economic liberation has caused prosperity. In the 1960s, Sir John Cowperthwaite, the financial secretary of Hong Kong, refused all instruction from his LSE-schooled masters in London to plan, regulate and manage the economy of his poor and refugee-overwhelmed island. Set merchants free to do what merchants can, was his philosophy. Today Hong Kong has higher per capita income than Britain.

In July 1948 Ludwig Erhard, director of West Germany’s economic council, abolished food rationing and ended all price controls on his own initiative. General Lucius Clay, military governor of the US zone, called him and said: “My advisers tell me what you have done is a terrible mistake. What do you say to that?” Erhard replied: “Herr General, pay no attention to them! My advisers tell me the same thing.” The German economic miracle was born that day; Britain kept rationing for six more years. Where are Europe’s Cowperthwaites and Erhards today?

A growth-preventing bureaucracy is not the only thing suppressing enterprise in Europe. Superstition is also playing a part, as it has done in past episodes of economic decline. The great flowering of Arab prosperity and culture under the Abbasids was brought to an end with the burning of books, the shutting down of inquiry and a mistrust of novelty.

Again there are echoes. Many of the ideas that led to the genetic modification of plants — which has boosted yields, cut insecticide use, saved fuel and soil, and helped the poorest farmers — were pioneered in this country. Yet today there is almost none of this work done in Britain and none of its boons are permitted to farmers and their customers. The labs are ghostly quiet. Why? Entirely because of neophobic superstition that has animated reactionary elites into opposing change on the basis of myths peddled by green mystics. (The biggest superstition of all is surely the worship of the euro: the sacrifice of growth, youth and truth at the altar of a mere currency.) By contrast, America, for all its fiscal incontinence, is still friendly to enterprise and open to novelty, as any time spent in Silicon Valley will prove. To avoid the fate of Ming China Europe needs to rediscover economic rationality.

\25 **The U.S. figure for passenger cars does not include light trucks, vans, or sport utility vehicles.** *These types of vehicles are often used to transport passengers in the United States and, therefore, contribute significantly to the total number of passenger vehicles there. But because they are generally used in developing countries for transporting goods, they are excluded from this analysis, which is intended to measure the global middle class in the developing world. Their exclusion does not change the main conclusion of this paper—that the global middle class in developing countries is likely much larger and expanding far more rapidly than income-based measures of this population suggest. Insofar as light trucks, vans, or sport utility vehicles are used in developing countries for the purpose of transporting passengers, this only strengthens the paper’s central conclusion.*

Socialized banking - I bet you never thought about it that way, but that is the truth of the matter, plain and simple.
&gt;
&gt;So you want an alternative? Reduce that sum for starters.

One the one hand, you're absolutely right, on the other hand, if the banks failed people would lose their savings and the economy would collapse.

There needs to be more regulation to prevent this from happening and to enforce the current rules and we should then get the state out of the business of subsidising the banking sector.

&gt;Then don't make shitty business and don't keep doing it once the troika gets here. We're talking about faulty business in the order of billions of euros of debt over the years, more than enough tobe the sole responsibel for our current situation.

The PPPs? I still don't know how we're paying for those. Again, you're right.

&gt;Not the healthcare sytem, not the education system.

These also need to be made more efficient but you're right, we need to set your priorities straight and these should be the last one to adjust.

&gt;Bad business regarding banks, investors, territorial management, highways, you name it. Just recently with the bank BPN 7 billions absorbed to public debt because the bank was nationalized, and now it's been reprivatized minus that debt. Once again, socialized banking.

Agreed.

&gt;Get rid of that, no more debt.

If only it was that easy. It's more than just that, it's the unsustainable social security, the pensions which won't last for long as they are, all the buildings made in the Socrates era, the PPPs, that's all dragging the economy down. Increasing taxes to pay for all of this is insane, specially now with all the unemployment and emigration we're already feeling, that's a recipe for disaster.

That bit about owning animals, that's quite a weird out of the way point I've never thought of before, thanks for saying it - I'll set up a debate for my next Ethics lesson and see what my class thinking about it :)

Now, the idea of differences in culture, of course that exists and of course it is extremely important - it's what makes us *us*. However, I do reckon there are universal rules/laws etc e.g. 'Do not kill' now that's pre-biblical no matter who argues for it, and it seemed to be a rule in many different cultures who never met each other, so humans must have an innate moral compass guiding them in rule making? Do you agree? 

Yeah, I agree with your assessment of Syria (especially about the
&gt;protecting it's interests and allies in the middle east than anything moral.

bit) However, if there was a neutral, well governed organisation - then America wouldn't be targeted? ;) 

Yeah I know about the League of Nations - they were shite because they didn't have a military to enforce it's rules and then Hitler left in '33 or around then and basically it was bollocks :) 

However the UN does have an army, yeah it's doing a good job - there hasn't been a world war. There aren't a load of countries trying to destroy each other - that we can admit. But people killing their own? Civil War? Religious War? This still goes on. The UN could do more if it wasn't run by bureaucrats only looking out for their own arses.

Many countries are OK with limiting free speech for things like libel, ""fire in a crowded theatre"" example, or in witness protection programmes. Many EU countries limit free speech for data protection reasons. Many countries limit free speech for hate speech type laws.

There is many times a trade off. Do we limit person A's right to free speech or do we limit person B's right to Y. In the case of witness protection, the Y is ""right to life and not be shot by mobsters"". In the case of data protection, Y is ""right to privacy"". For hate speech, the Y is ""right to live your life (e.g. be an open gay man) without risk of being killed or assaulted"". There is not one approach that fits every case. Some cases (e.g. witness protection), are very serious, so the limits on free speech are more severe. Some (e.g. hate speech) can be more general, so the approach &amp; penalties where you draw the line are different.

But there is similarly compelling evidence that austerity isn't leading to a healthy economy in Latvia if you look at *employment*, as Krugman does [here](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/latvia-once-again/). Even if there were some kind of unsustainable boom going on before the crisis, Latvia's employment level is still probably over 10% below what it would have been 5 years ago without the boom. That tempers my enthusiasm for saying ""look at the great growth number for Latvia this year"" since the economy is still so far below its potential.

I think it's important to be careful about what the point that Yglesias and Krugman are trying to make really is. It is *not* that Latvia has nothing good about it, or that Latvia had lots of other great options that would have worked better. Maybe Latvia's economy is doing the best it could have done under the circumstances (especially considering the *strategic* importance of doing everything necessary to join the EU). 

The point is that American and EU commentators who say ""look at Latvia's good growth number this year; this shows that austerity works and we should do it in our country too"" are wrong, for two reasons. First, Latvia's good growth numbers for this year don't change the fact that it's economy is still very depressed, so it's a strange measure of ""success"" for everyone else to aspire to.

What happens when you make public transportation free is to make living in suburbs more advantageous as they would previously have been, thus increasing value of property in suburbs and suppressing it in downtown. This disruption of market will lead to people living in suboptimal locations and lead to construction of new developments to suboptimal places.
* When public transportation becomes non-free again, there will be great fluctuation in usage of public transportation, some routes will be abandoned completely while others see significantly lower transportation numbers. This will wreck future planning and development of public transportation. In the long run the aim must be that public transportation can be run profitably.

Another issue to note is that cars aren't a bad choice for transportation.

Everyone does. About 50 000 votes decide who makes up the next government and no party is in a position to ignore a segment of voters.

&gt; He has been so shamed by the media for his corrupt ways that he has almost ceased to appear in interviews.

Not true. For example, all major regional newspapers (Valgamaalane, Pärnu Postimees, Sakala, Virumaa Teataja, Järva Teataja) are at the moment collecting questions for an interview with him. Papers will print his answers to reader-submitted questions in mid-January.

&gt; Oh, but he has his own television channel (Tallinn's television), which is kept up on tax payer's money. It's a propaganda channel full of bullshit.

Not really. While its news do have a bias (mostly by omission), it still provides good coverage of local events, of heritage, etc. 

&gt; The reason why he's still relevant in politics is because the Russians and old people vote for him, because they are basically the only ones who still believe in his demagogy.

They vote for him because he delivers. For example, if his party is able to push through a deal with farmacies to give significant discounts to the elderly, they would be fools not to vote for him.

Ritornando al discorso del post:
La situazione italiana e' ovviamente disperata se parliamo della partecipazione alla politica, dato che, a mio parere, e' arrivata al pari di religione e calcio, dove nessuno e' disposto a mettersi in gioco ma piuttosto al minimo segno di dissenso, si chiude a riccio e attacca indiscriminatamente. 

Nessuno ha la vaga decenza di provare a pensare di informarsi e piuttosto preferisce aggrapparsi a dogmi o ideologie propinategli da qualcun altro.

Questi problemi si combinano e si intercciano in una magnifica varieta' di forme ma costituiscono fondamentalmente l'atteggiamento italiano che permette il sopravvivere di ideologie datate e/o estremiste e/o dogmatiche..

Perche' sono semplici!! Riescono a dividere il mondo in bianco e nero facilitando le scelte...

Un altro grande problema italiano, forse il piu' grande, e' la nostra storia...

Fino a 150 anni fa siamo sempre stati divisi in staterelli campanilistici e in confronto continuo, questo e' risultato nell'italiano moderno in una tendenza che io definisco 

""anarchico campanilista che tira a campare""

(Spiego le parole dato che non attribuisco il senso originale)

Anarchico perche' rifiuta l'autorita' dello stato. L'italiano soggiace alla volonta dello stato solo se proprio non puo' farne a meno.

Campanilista perche' non siamo mai riusciti a creare un sentimento nazionalistico, un senso di unione, ma anzi ci troviamo a odiare il paese vicino.

Che tira a campare. ecco questa e' un espressione che, unita' al campanilismo, indica il vero grande problema italiano.

L'italiano non riesce a pensare oltre al proprio naso, oltre al proprio circolo di cari, cerca di fare il meglio per loro, no matter what... 

Cerca di arrangiarsi, copiando ad un esame, pagando in nero, chiedendo il favore all'amico in municipio, etc..

senza rendersi conto che e' proprio questo il motivo per cui l'italia va a rotoli: lo fan tutti perche' non lo devo fare anch'io??

&gt; 1. This decision is made after a public referendum where 75% of the people voted yes on free public transport.

Most of the places that hosted this so called ""public referendum"" and where one could vote were placed strategically to where most of Tallinn mayor's usual voters like to hang around, e.g near to all the cheapest supermarkets in and near Lasnamäe. I happened to use Stockmann, Kristiine keskus aswell as Järve keskus at the time of the voting and I couldn't spot any.

&gt; 2. Russians can't vote. You need to be a citizen of Estonia or the EU to vote in local elections(or referendums.) The Russians living here, who are constantly vilified in the media, are neither.

What has this got anything to do with anything? The voting was directed towards those who had residence in Tallinn and who were paying their taxes to Tallinn. You can vote on whatever polls you'd like, as long as you're not a non-Estonian citizen voting for the parliament.

&gt; 3. What's wrong with politicians making decisions based on what people want? Some would say that's their job. A large part of the people in Tallinn(and Estonia and the Europe) are 'old'. Surely they need to be represented?

Are you really sure that those people who participated in the voting really ""knew"" what they were voting for or maybe someone drew a carefully orchestrated media stunt and was therefore in a better place to know? As much as I've seen and heard about Keskerakond's/Savisaar's tactics, then it has been all around demagogy right from the beginning. Which is also the reason why the guy is a mayor: populism really is his solution to problems. Unfortunately, that works on best on those who aren't educated as well as those who actually can see further from those green election banners that paint the city for weeks before elections with slogans such as ""Done!"".


&gt; 4. You can see the TV guide for Tallinn TV here: http://www.tallinnatv.eu/index.php?id=3424[1] It mostly shows concerts, documentaries, miniseries' and sports. Uh and the news. Which of those is the propaganda? He also appears regularly on radio shows on publicly funded channels. Are those propaganda channels as well? A lot of things are paid by tax payers' money.

I'm sure parking your six-figure Mercedes where ever you like undoubtedly creates a good impression on anyone. Yes, that also implies he won't be using any of that free public transportation, since he never uses any. Compare that to some of his counterparts in ""Europe"" who actually bike to work.



Additionally, waiving fares for public transportation would mean the money to fund it would have to come from somewhere else. The city argued that it will come from taxes of those people who will be then registering themselves as a residents of Tallinn.

In the last election the True Finns took a huge landslide and was the third largest party, almost winning the Democrats. However they went to opposition since they could not agree on their politics with EU with the largest party (Coalition). So our nation is divided by Centre, Coalition and Democrats against True finns, as it were. Now it seems (according to the yellow press) that our nation is split in two. Those who can't understand why we spend money to something that doesn't seem to help, and those who are trying their best to pull europe from this mess.

Now, our President (who has been a pretty laid down guy always) wants to show an example that we should all tighten our belts. As a matter of fact, all the representatives in the Coalition are cutting their wages by example. Also our eyes are turning towards the mayor of Helsinki who just got a raise, and now earns more than the mayor of London (600k people vs some 11 million?).

I see it's not a matter of the actual amount of money, it's the idea of one man making a fuckload of money when the people he's fighting for are standing in line for a loaf of bread.

A lot of people in the Legion, think that it'll be disbanded within 10 years and that they'll only keep 1RE for the sake of tradition.

You will not find any Legionnaires that truly believe we are the best. 

We are an outdated army, 100 years ago it worked because warfare was pretty simple in comparison.
It was the toughest most disciplined army that won.(And the Legion mostly lost, with a few victories)

I does attract scum, though the Gestapo does their best to root people out, some people are turned into animals during training, and life in the Legion.

We call you ""Chlabor"" from back in WWII when the french army had those ear flaps, and the German Legionnaires called you guys that.

During training or even in regiment, if a legionnaire fucks up or shows a lack of discipline, you are reminded that, ""vous et pas de chlabor, vous et les Legionnaires"". Some Legionnaires will not even salute French officers(who are not in the Legion), and will disrespect Females of any rank.

Bart De Wever, to my knowledge, has never even said those words. Thy know, that, when they *actually* propose a full split of Belgium, a lot of people will not vote for them for exactly that reason.

Why do a lot of people vote for N-VA now? Because the N-VA is one of the only parties heavily criticising inefficiencies in our government, while other parties say it's not as bad as it seems. Also, the N-VA receives very little fact-checking from journalists. The media loves Bart De Wever because he's a great communicator/debater/dry funny man.

Another thing to realise is that Belgium already has a lot of its government split up. Education/Roadworks/etc... are already split up in separate governments.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Destroying the economy and the productive tissue of a country is not good for Europe, there is the need of a European policy to tackle the huge unemployment

You know how you tackle unemployment? By reducing taxes. You know what low taxes imply? Cutting public spending and austerity.

If you really want to promote employment and economic growth, you'd be for and not against austerity.

&gt;the never ending austerity for austerity sake

What the fuck? Austerity isn't for austerity sake, it's to bring [this massive debt](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/government-debt-to-gdp) down! If we had, say, a debt to GDP ratio of 60 and we were doing these cuts, I'd be with you, I'd say it wasn't necessary. But on the contrary, our public debt is larger than our own GDP! Arguing against the spending cuts when our debt is this massive is arguing against the country itself, it's just not sustainable, not even close! If we want to keep things working properly on any long term scale, we need to be spending less and bringing this debt back to acceptable levels!

&gt;the recessive spiral the countries are in

While the economy doesn't grow, that will be difficult.

If you want to make the economy grow, again, you don't need public spending for that (public spending only redistributes wealth by taxing and spending, it doesn't actually create wealth), it only needs to assure the conditions for generating growth (such as lowering taxation, increasing the flexibility of the labour market, making our justice system working again and reducing bureaucratic requirements, for example).

Again, this is irrelevant to austerity, austerity simply means to cut public spending, it doesn't mean ""salt the fields and burn the villages"" like you must think it does.

&gt;Blindy doing what the Troika wants without any concern of how it will affect the country is plainly stupid.

That's a pretty one-sided picture you paint there. The pension age was finally raised, after years and years of postponing this issue. Unemployment benefits were lowered substantially (and they drop much quicker to a lower level if you're unemployed). They're forcing unemployed people to accept job offers strongly, both in Flanders and Wallonia. Apparently we had to wait untill we had a socialist from Wallonia as a prime minister for this happen, because I didn't see any of that happen when Leterme or Verhofstadt were prime minister.

&gt;Right-to-carry laws reduce the number of people killed or wounded from multiple victim public
shootings as many attackers are either deterred from attacking or when attacks do occur they are
stopped before the police can arrive. We are able to provide evidence for the first time that the harm
from crimes that still occur can be mitigated. Given that half the attackers in these multiple victim
public shootings have had formal diagnoses of mental illness, the fact that some results indicate
concealed handgun laws reduce these attacks by almost 70 percent is remarkable.

&gt;Differences in state right-to-carry laws are also important: restricting the places where permits
are prohibited increases murders, injuries and shootings; more training requirements reduce
injuries; and higher fees increase injuries and the number of attacks. The much greater deterrence
that right-to-carry laws have for multiple victim public shootings than for other crimes like murder
is consistent with the notion that a higher probability of citizens being able to defend themselves
should produce a greater level of deterrence. The results are robust with respect to different
specifications of the dependent variable, different specifications of the handgun law variable, and
different control variables. Not only does the passage of a right-to-carry law have a significant
impact on multiple shootings but it is the only gun law that appears to have a significant impact.
While other law enforcement efforts -- from the arrest rate for murder and the death penalty --
reduce the number of people harmed from multiple shootings, the effect is not as consistently
significant as for right-to-carry laws. Finally, the data provides no evidence of substitution from
shootings to bombings and little consistent evidence of “copycat” effects.

The deficit is shrinking (albeit at a slower than expected pace), debt is increasing at a slower rate (still higher than expected), unemployment is increasing (as expected) and it's pretty obvious that contractionary policies have recessive effects. So what's your point exactly? All this was expected. The adjustment isn't even supposed to be completed in one or two years, even more so when the Euro trading block is in a recession. Out of all of the factors you mentioned, only unemployment can arguably decrease, but only if Portugal left the Euro.

Nonetheless you forget to mention positive outcomes, such as 10 year yields dipping below 7 percent for the first time since talks of a bailout first popped up, the external rebalancing and the subsequent stabilization of the current account deficit and political pressure to enact necessary reforms. 

Look, neither the economy nor the productive tissue of the country are being ""destroyed"". There has been a huge misallocation of resources for decades, as the public sector as a whole grew virtually unchecked. Debt dynamics became unstable as malinvestment and losses in competitiveness led to a stagnating economy - resulting in the status quo. The Troika is no boogey man, a loan under certain circumstances was offered and accepted. If you're not happy, vote to end the deal, but don't expect to evade the fallout.

Any short-term solution that doesn't correct the misallocation of resources in the economy will lead to severe inefficiencies, loss of competitiveness and lagging real growth. Unfortunately, unless the Euro is abandoned there isn't even much of a choice except to undergo internal devaluation (excluding transfers from other soverigens, which is their prerogative, not Portugal's).

The original conversation with your dear friendo tugasnake that originated the conversation you linked to was about how he hates black people and Africa and how white people are genetically superior to black people (you know, all those clever things only a superior being would barf down their brain). 

It was a thread about the rich people paying for the crisis, it was nothing about tugasnake and the shit he posts on r/niggers and the like.

&gt;So what I said was: Os recursos limitados são um problema das políticas de Direita, e não da Esquerda libertária. Or 'limited resources are a problem of rightwing politics and not libertarian left politics.' 

Which is outright retarded. Say that to anyone, they'll tell you it's retarded.

Limited resources are a problem of there being limited resources on this universe, heck, even if there was unlimited food and unlimited water and unlimited oil and unlimited animals, you still need time to extract and process those goods and time itself is a resource, so we'd still be limited in that regard. Unless ""libertarian left"" is some Jesus multiplying the fishes and the bread and wine which never runs out, don't say such stupid bullshit, that right wing limits us with regards to resources but left wing leads to post-scarcity.

&gt;Rightwing politics do little to promote stable growth and an ecological management of resources. they're all about plundering for profit. Libertarian politics, which have been and are applied in small scale, do the contrary.

You're already changing the meaning of your words.

Regardless, how does that rightwing and leftwing work, actually? Nazi Germany was the antithesis stable growth and ecological management and Soviet Russia the proof that we can promote stable and sustainable growth?

Or maybe lests drop the authoritarian states and replace them with more democratic ones - how do you explain Switzerland which is, by all standards, very rightwing, and yet presents stable growth and prosperity and, on the libertarian end, Somalia, where there isn't even a state to keep the order and yet they have shortages of everything and wouldn't really say their country has stable growth as they don't present any growth at all!

I'm not so sure, he introduces his lovely ideas about blac people whenever and wherever he can, even if it's unrelated to the subject. I know I had an exchange with him about that subject that lead him to the conclusion of his I mentioned above.

&gt; Limited resources are a problem of there being limited resources on this universe, heck, even if there was unlimited food and unlimited water and unlimited oil and unlimited animals, you still need time to extract and process those goods and time itself is a resource, so we'd still be limited in that regard. Unless ""libertarian left"" is some Jesus multiplying the fishes and the bread and wine which never runs out, don't say such stupid bullshit, that right wing limits us with regards to resources but left wing leads to post-scarcity.

The 'libertarian left' Jesus was once called Agriculture. Many scientific improvements for agricultural sutainability have been achieved yet seldom applied by big corporations unwilling to replenish the starving belly that pays the highest bid across the world. In the west that bid is monetary, in Africa it's starvation which makes of thos corporations backdoors to populaton control, and blackmailing leaders with the risk of not getting food and aid (which they need because they can't develop agriculture, and why can't they do that? because the west doesn't support meaningful change in the region to do so).

&gt; Nazi Germany was the antithesis stable growth and ecological management and Soviet Russia the proof that we can promote stable and sustainable growth?

Those were both authoritarian regimes bent on military spending. Their wing leanings were overshadowed by their authoritarian principles. Anyway, Staline never implemented any set of policies that are markedly leftwing, only markedly authoritarian. Same goes for Hitler who wasn't entirely fascist, he reserved a basic form of socialism to an elite (aryans), even though it was poorly envisioned, which leads me to believe it was just part of his populist strategy to make people race behind the anti-anything-not-aryan nazis were fond of. Basically,all the thing they did with slightly market wing leanings were secodnary and half-ased and served the military and empirialistic puporses of their personal mad-man agendas.

&gt; how do you explain Switzerland which is, by all standards, very rightwing, and yet presents stable growth and prosperity and, on the libertarian end, Somalia, where there isn't even a state to keep the order and yet they have shortages of everything and wouldn't really say their country has stable growth as they don't present any growth at all!

Switzerland and Somalia are very specific cases and are unrepresentative of basic political orientations. Switzerland has a banking system and financial policies that are attractive to investors all over the world (mostly for all the wrong reasons, imo). So they have economic growth. That growth only translates to socialgrowth, infrastructure improvement, services improvement and all other living quality factors, because it's located right in the middle of the biggest economy in the world, the EU. Locate Switzerland to the Caribbean sea and you get the Caiman islands, which is a pretty bad place to live for the common citizen.

Somalia is riddled with theocratic sectarianism, black markets, unfortunate external intervention, etc. which are all connected together. Argentina after its default in the early 2000's is a better example of how leftwing policies can work from the local level up. Also, the lack of government institutions in Somalia is something I abhor. What they're doing there in that regard isn't leftwing, it's I-don't-give-a-fuck-wing.

&gt; I honestly don't know which crack pipe you've been smoking to defend anarcho-sindicalism or whatever you're trying to present as an alternative to the current systems that predominate in the Western world.

There's food that could be going to Africa yet our protectionist policies prevent that. It also prevents them from exporting to us and generate some wealth of their own. We can thank CAP for that.

This protectionism, this central-planning and these subsidies, there's are against the market and these are always put forward by the left, so don't turn the tables when it's actually the fault of people such as yourself who have no clue about how the market works and yet have these crazy ideas to improve it that never work as intended.

I'm not blind. I'm well aware of the consequences of political lies and populism. I never said people who gave themselves the title of leftwing ideologues have done great things to their country. It serves your argument to pretend you believe them too like the peasants who have supported them, so you pretend to be blinded by their 'entitlement' - ""if they say they're leftwing, then what they do must be leftwing"".

Freedom of trade is great if you don't sacrifice government institutions that preserve basic human rights in order to achieve that 'freedom'.

&gt; Somalia is an hellhole in anarchy, I fail to see how anyone could see anything good in it.

Me, too. My point was exactly that. It's an anarchy, not leftwing.

Yes, but it wasn't for a while. The right crept in quickly and here we are.

No, it's not that. That's extreme anarchy, which isn't leaning to any political wing. And it doesn't have to have small authority. It just has to maintain institutions that preserve basic human rights, even if that means asking a fair share from the wealthy to do so.

Since you mentioned the term 'progressive tax' I'd like to point out that in France that term has a very clear and practical meaning. I'll try to explain. Let's say you make 1 million euros. So you assume you're on the 75% bracket. Not quite. Only the sum of your income above the previous bracket would be taxed at 75%. Basically what this means it that yor income is divided into the sums of the different tax brakcet and each of these sums is taxed according to those tax brackets, not the 75%. Basically, only a small portion of your million is taxed at 75%. it should be called stacked taxes, but 'progressive' makes it seem more modern or whatever.

* Norway export energy to the EU, not manufactured goods. Resources are easier to move than manufactured products. 

* UK has some of these energy resources, sure, but not close to the level of Norway; especially in terms of market penetration. I'm not too familiar with the British oil and gas industry, but I would assume their export limit is roughly half of Norway's.

* Norway contribute a *huge* amount of money to the EU, to be used in benefit, welfare, or research programmes. I'd doubt the people of the UK, and government, would want to do the same considering they would just have decided to leave the EU.

* If controlled to the Rotterdam Effect, UK export to the EU is still 40%. By the same token, when the Rotterdam Effect is removed on the US, that number is 14%. The UK needs the EU market, and they need them in a competitive market. Leave the EU and your goods will have tariffs up the wall.

* Why? Because if the UK leaves the EU, don't you think Germany + France will want to make an example of them? They would know it'd be imperative that no other country leave, especially right away. While I don't think we'll be moving back into mercantilsm, I'd be very surprised if the EU didn't make it as difficult as possible for UK businesses to penetrate the EU market, if only to save face.

&gt; based on the relevant EU regulations which the Republic of Cyprus is required to apply, only a small specific number of state officials and other dignitaries are allowed to bypass security screening checks at Cypriot airports. These include heads of state and government among a few others but do not include heads of diplomatic missions.

&gt; Article 29 of the Vienna Convention says: “The person of a diplomatic agent shall be inviolable. He shall not be liable to any form of arrest or detention.”

&gt; And Article 41 adds: “Without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State.”

And then... from the comments on that news site, it seems that someone who works at the European Commission added the following:

&gt; It should be added that according to Article 38
1. Except insofar as additional privileges and immunities may be granted by the receiving State, a
diplomatic agent who is a national of or permanently resident in that State **shall enjoy only immunity from jurisdiction, and inviolability, in respect of official acts performed in the exercise of his functions**.

That section would apply to a Cypriot citizen who happens to be a diplomatic agent of the Egyptian government in Cyprus.
