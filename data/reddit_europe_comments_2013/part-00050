$$$ est une raison mais pas la seul, il y en a pleins pouvant créer des débats sans fin.  
Une plante qui peut soigner tant de choses mais avec comme revers de la médaille un fort potentiel de tomber dans l'abus.  
Qu'un malade en abuse a peu d'importance du moment ou ça sert de traitement et de prévention. Souvent ils se font prescrire bien pire!
ça soulage tellement de maux différents que ça fait des jaloux dans les rangs de non malades ou moins malades.  
Des ""Moi aussi j'en ai besoin pour dormir!"", ""Aux USA c'est autorisé pour les asthmatique! "", ""En Amérique des gens se le font prescrire pour..."" ...  
Donc même pas droit au Sativex en France pour les malades, bien qu'étant élaboré à partir d'une bonne génétique  à partir de croisement entres plantes venant des 4 coins du monde, a partir des fleurs et des feuilles dont ils font une teinture mère avec un taux élevé de THC (Raison mis en avant pour l'interdiction) et de CBD pour palier aux effets de défonce du THC.  
Paradoxalement, même si une variété de chanvre contient un taux légale de THC (inférieur à 0.3%), un malade n'aura toujours pas le droit légalement d'en consommer même si le chenevis est légale à cultiver et contient des cannabinoïdes pouvant soigner.    
Le cannabis est un exemple de plante médicinale, la Sauge aussi a pas mal de vertus, les menthes aussi, la Brunnelle commune aussi... Les entreprises pharmaceutiques font des recherches dessus depuis des lustres et leur culture n'est pas interdite.   
Il y a un potentiel pour tomber dans l'abus (utilisation quotidienne) qui est nul et ils ne sont pas interdit et bien souvent intéressent peu les malades. Pas toujours aussi efficace et pas de défonce.  
C'est vraiment con pour le malade dans l'article, mais c'est pas fini, il va retenter.  
  Pour résumer, je pense qu''étant facile à arrêter, il est tout aussi facile de tomber dans une utilisation quotidienne comme avec d'autres psychotropes tels que le café et la clope.
Contrairement au Tabac ou au Café, c'est une plante dont la culture est très simple. Donc avec un haut risque de consommation excessive sans apporter de gros retours d'argent à l'état ou à des entreprises....

On y lit entre autres que 

&gt; La consommation d’alcool en France diminue régulièrement depuis 40 ans. Entre 1961 et 2008, elle a baissé de moitié, passant de 26 à 12,3 litres d’alcool pur par an et par habitant de plus de 15 ans. Cette baisse est principalement imputable à la diminution de la consommation de vin, qui reste néanmoins la boisson alcoolique la plus consommée. La consommation totale de bière, après une légère augmentation jusqu’au milieu des années 1970, a retrouvé son niveau de 1960, tandis que celle de spiritueux reste relativement stable. La diminution de la consommation d’alcool s’accompagne d’un changement des modes de consommation. Selon les professionnels du secteur, l’alcool passe de l’univers des repas à celui des loisirs ; en particulier, le vin comme boisson quotidienne régresse, mais il accède de plus en plus à un statut festif. Ces constats sont confirmés par les données de l’Insee : les Français se tournent désormais vers les vins de qualité (2,7 % d’augmentation par an en moyenne depuis 1960) au détriment des vins de consommation courante (2,4 % de baisse par an).

(1620-88) nahm altgediente schwedische Korporale, die nach dem Einfall in die Kurmark gefangengenommen worden waren, nach der Zerschlagung des schwedischen Heeres in brandenburgische Dienste auf und ließ sie die preußischen Rekruten drillen. Wegen des treuen Kampfes dieser Schweden an der Seite ihrer neuen Waffenbrüder nahm der Ausdruck bei den Soldaten und der Berliner Bevölkerung schon bald die Bedeutung »Kamerad, alter Freund« an. Darüberhinaus gibt es auch den »alten Schwäden«, der aber mit Schweden nichts zu tun hat. Er ist nichts anderes, als ein verkommener Saufbruder - »schwadern, schwädern oder schwudern« kommt aus dem Rotwelschen und bedeutet »betrunken, besoffen« sein.

Pay is decent but you pay a lot of taxes its similar to Canada but way more expensive than the US. Healthcare is good you are forced to get health insurance and they deduct i think 8 or 10 percent from your paycheque. 


train is pretty good but can be pretty expensive if travelling every day, i pay 140 a month for my pass i have to go about 30 min to get to work... to give you an idea... if you want to go from Frankfurt to Paris its about 8 hours, Amsterdam 7 hours, Prague is about 5 hours, Italy 10 hours, Switzerland 6 hours,  looking at paying maybe 100 -200 Euro, travelling to any of those places.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; So where would you place the massive levels of overspending by the government through before the 00s, and especially during the 00s after entering the euro zone? 

I already explained that, albeit a bit indirectly. Paying in drachmas is fundamentally different from paying in euros. Paying in drachmas means an automatic debt haircut all the time. The value of drachma is depreciating quickly so when you accept payment in that currency you are effectively giving some leeway to your debtor to pay you less than your product's actual market value. By taking out the different currencies out of the equation, this automatic balancing mechanism is gone and, with nothing to replace it, the countries with the smallest productive capacity keep becoming more and more indebted. 

&gt; You don't rack up such a high debt-GDP ratio through weak productive capacity, especially if you have successful public sector companies.

I'm not sure if you're serious. A few public corporations don't make that much difference in the macro-level. Unless we're talking about Norway or something. 

&gt; I'd happily accept your argument, it just seems to be overlooking some important things that are Greece specific. I would argue the crises in different countries resulted in similar consequences (large government debt), but came about in very different ways (I would say Greece, Portugal and Italy are similar, with different origins). Ireland is different altogether. Ireland happened due to the property bubble bursting, bad government and banking decisions (to provide such an excess of loans to finance the property bubble), and an over reliance on the United States for business. Spain is similar to Ireland in property, not for the private sector banking issues as much. 

I'm trying to look at the big picture behind all these regional problems. I admit that it is probable that all these occurrences are less intertwined than what I suppose but I think it is more probable that all these little things are symptomatic of a larger systemic issue. If I'm wrong, then ironing out these regional problems will lead to stability given the current course of action, so in a way I hope I'm wrong.

* As a set of languages: won't work because the most common search will probably anyway be ""English results, but within in Europe""

* As a set of IP ranges: probably your best bet. I'm not a network expert, but I would guess *most* European sites would be identifiable based on an IP address that locates them as being (geographically) ""within Europe"". Would **not** work though for European websites that are hosted outside of Europe.

* Via Whois lookup. Similar to the IP address definition above, but could also include results from websites where the registrar is from Europe.

* A combination of the above. That's probably the best I can think of so far: ""A website is *European* if its IP address is within the range of European IP addresses OR its TLD is in the set of European TLDs OR its registrar (as determined by whois) is from Europe"".

I didn't say anything about Anglocentrism. This has nothing to do with it. It's more about the fact that their search services are getting traffic no matter what. They have a monopoly on information flow and they have no incentive of changing anything. You don't like Google?!

Your logic is solid but you forget the fact that they are interested in profit and not in developing some specific supply to a sort of close cross European identity. How many people are looking for European News accumulated from across all International news sources? Probably not that much. Even if there was such a thing the major European countries like Germany, France, the UK, etc. are going to continue reading their own news making it impossible for anything Euro to grow and gain profit.

Je le redis donc plus clairement : l'insécurité est plus un problème pour les hommes que pour les femmes. Simplement, dans l'éducation des femmes, on vous apprend à être des victimes et à avoir peur.

&gt;Peut être ne peux tu pas comprendre car tu ne vis pas en île de France.

Désolé, mais là tu te goures : j'ai vécu 7 ans dans le 77, 7 dans le 78, 3 dans le 93, j'ai bossé à Nanterre, Aulnay-Sous-Bois, La Courneuve, Noisy-Le-Grand. Je me suis fait braquer dans le 20ème, taper à la sortie du métro 5 ou 6 fois et insulter tellement de fois que ça se compte plus. Je mesure 1m30 pour 40 kilos donc évidemment je n'ai aucune chance en baston, mais la dernière réaction que j'aurais, ce sera de refuser de prendre le RER parce que j'ai 0.01% de chance de me faire agresser. En même temps, je prends les RERs et transiliens depuis que j'ai 10 ans, je dois être désensibilisé.

Le message des ""Filles de France"" n'est que de la mauvaise propagande mal argumentée, avec des chiffres faux, destinée à répéter aux filles qu'il faut qu'elles aient peur alors que les données disent le contraire.

Bref, ta peur dans le RER, c'est comme [avoir peur des araignées dans Fort-Boyard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVceM4-ip4w).

Αctually, we let you use the Euboean alphabet. 

&gt; The Euboean alphabet was used in the cities of Eretria and Chalkis and in related colonies in southern Italy, notably in Cumae and in Pithekoussai. It was through this variant that the Greek alphabet was transmitted to Italy, giving rise to the Old Italic alphabets, including Etruscan, and ultimately the Latin alphabet.

You've got to be kidding. The 12th century? They'd be allowed *some* places *some* of the time, but then every few years someone would decide to kill, enslave, or mutilate them.

By 1660s [sixteen different countries outlawed the Roma](http://ethosmagonline.com/archives/8502), many executing them on sight. The Swiss even hunted them for sport.

In the 1700s Bohemia was branding, cutting off the ears of, then hanging them. Austria was not allowing them to marry, and they were enslaved by the Romanians.

Moving forward there's obviously the Holocaust(in which huge numbers died) but a large number of countries inbetween undergoing similar deportation/mutilation efforts.

In the 1940s they were sterilized in the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

In the 1960s they were effectively outlawed from a large number of establishments in the UK(“No Blacks, No dogs, No Gypsies”)

In the 2000s they were forcibly segregated in many countries, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Denmark, and Romania. Most forced them into ""special education"" programs based on their background.

In recent years they've had their villages burnt down and been kicked out of numerous countries across eastern Europe as well.

http://ling.uni-graz.at/~rombase/cgi-bin/art.cgi?src=data/hist/modern/maria.en.xml

&gt;The fourth decree issued in 1773 prohibited marriages between Roma. Mixed marriages were encouraged by subsidies. The permission to get married, however, was bound to an attestation of ""a proper way of life and knowledge of the Catholic religious doctrine"". Since the Empress and her counselors were of the opinion that the ""civilization"" of the ""gypsies""was the basis for a successful ""domiciliation"", she ordered that all children over the age of five should be taken away from their parents and be handed over to a Hungarian farmer’s family who were supposed to take charge of their Christian upbringing against payment. The children should grow up isolated from their own parents in different comitats, go to school and later learn a trade or become farmers.[...]

&gt;For the use of the ""gypsy language"", for example, the law provided a flogging with 24 blows. Despite the sanctions ordered in case of offences, the coercive measures imposed by Maria Theresia and Joseph II were effective only to a certain degree.[...]

Vuoi davvero giustificare la decisione di inviare le query di ricerca locali a Canonical per ottimizzare i risultati di ricerca pubblicitari, senza un esplicito opt-in?


Ti faccio poi notare, nonostante la tua bollatura di zelota fosse evidentemente parodistica, che l'immensa differenza di Stallman consta nell'assenza dei metodi poco *ortodossi* di ammazzare l'invasore che utilizzavano gli zeloti, la cui fede era rivolta al loro dio e non alla libertà in quanto tale. 

Non mi pare infatti che esista l'inquisizione del free software o le SS dello Stallman-pensiero. Con questo voglio dire che nonostante ci sia chi difende e diffonde quegli ideali, difficilmente criticabili dal punto di vista etico, puoi tranquillamente fare finta che non esistano e non succede nulla.

Se poi ritieni eccessive la pedanteria o la pignoleria con cui da sempre ammonisce chi utilizza termini in maniera secondo lui errata posso senza dubbio capire: tuttavia, più che bollarla come arrabbiatura, ripeto, direi che è solo coerenza verso quello che sostiene da sempre oltre al voler vedere riconosciuto il lavoro che lui e il suo gruppo hanno compiuto.

Schweiz. Hier gibt es wohl relative wenig Grafitis und die werden auch immer schön wieder weggemacht. Mir ist es relative egal wie gross der Einschlag auf meine Gebühren ist. Wenn da täglich ein paar duzend Leute im ganten Lande mit ihren Gerätschaften rumputzen müssen/müssten, dann kommt da sehr schnell ein grösserer Betrag zusammen. Es geht mir ums Prinzip. 100k, 1mio oder ein paar Millionen, es handelt sich hierbei um Geld das Leute hart verdient haben und aus dem sie sich Service Public wünschen.

Ne, zum Glück nicht. Ich habe eigentlich auch schon immer drauf geachtet auch sonstigen Dreck nicht rumliegen zu lassen (grundsätzlich, Ausnahmen gab es ohne Zweifel auch). Natürlich verursachen wir alle Kosten, aber es gibt einen grossen Unterschied zwischen einer vergessenen Flasche Bier die am morgen von den Stadtarbeitern rutinemässig eingesammelt wurde und der absichtlichen Sachbeschädigung, die Niemand will und hohe kosten verursacht. 

Naja, so oder so, es ging ja ums Prinzip. Ich sehe hier so gut wie keine Grafitis (bis auf kleines gekritzel), die meisten Leute teilen wohl meine Meinung. Ich finde Grafitis übrigens super, jedoch halt nicht wenn's um Eigentumsbeschädigung geht. Ich hatte mal eine Bekanntschaft die gerne Grafitis auf private und öffentliche Gebäude schmierte.

Then why do you have such a limited field of view?

&gt; what is the point, why is this posted?

The question is ""why different people post different things"". The answer is that some people don't care about funny pictures, others about history, and so on. 

&gt; Why should anyone care that there were raids in the Balkans in the fifth to seventh centuries?

Tens of millions of people live in the Balkans (roughly the population of France), the Balkans are in Europe, and we're discussing this in /r/europe. The real life extension is that many countries have unresolved issues, but they are often baseless. This table serves as the perfect example.

&gt; Why are Slavenes and Antes bolded? Who are they? ""The making of the Slavs"" ? 

The author of the book you see at the bottom of the table is writing about the making of the Slavs. You study history. Please, don't make me explain who the Slavs are and how different tribes made them.

Edit: thanks for the downvotes, I guess that's the price for reasonable explanations. I'll post some lolcats next time.

true,iBina,null,null,"Einleitung: 
Ich möchte euch etwas über meine Profilarbeit erzählen. Ich habe meine Profilarbeit über Apple geschrieben, weil ich mich für die Wirtschaft interessiere und Apple ein großer Betrieb ist. 
Geschichte: 
Ich fange mit der Geschichte an. Das Unternehmen wurde am 3. Januar 1977 von Steve Jobs und Steve Wozniak gegründet. Das Unternehmen fing  in Steve Jobs‘ Garage an. Steve Jobs und Steve Wozniak haben viel experimentiert und dadurch erstand der Apple I. Der Computer war nicht sehr beliebt und das Unternehmen war nicht sehr erfolgreich, aber das änderte sich mit der Einführung der Apple II Computer. Der Apple II war erfolgreich und auch der Erste Persönliche Computer in der Welt. Nach dem Apple II hat Apple viele Versionen herausgebracht, aber keine Version war sehr erfolgreich. In 1984 hat Apple den Macintosh auf dem Markt gebracht, und das war ein Erfolg. Der Macintosh war sehr originell, aber für manche Leute zu revolutionär. Danach hat Apple ziemlich gute Resultate aber das war nicht mehr so in den Neunzigern. Es gab sehr viel Wettbewerb und darum hat Apple einen kleinen Marktanteil und Apple verkaufte auch nicht viele Produkte. In 1997 war Apple fast Bankrott gegangen, aber Apple wurde durch eine Investition gerettet. Danach hat sehr viel sich geändert und Apple hat ein großes Comeback gemacht. Der Erste Mac Computer wurde eingeführt und Apple hat sehr dem Design sehr viel Aufmerksamkeit geben. Apple bekam auch sehr populär in dieser Zeit. In 2001 kam ein tragbares Musikabspielgerät, der iPod. Der iPod war sehr erfolgreich und in den folgenden Jahren gab es viele Versionen. Es gab den iPod Touch, Classic, Nano, Shuffle, und Mini. In den Vereinigten Staaten hat Apple einen Marktanteil von mehr als 90 Prozent. Apple hat nach dem iPod auch noch das iPad und das iPhone auf den Markt gebracht.
Produkte
iPod: 
Der iPod war der erste Erfolg von Apple. Es ist ein tragbares, digitales, Musikabspielgerät und der iPod war sehr charakteristisch für Apple. Es hat eine schöne, einfache Formgebung und war sehr benutzerfreundlich. Der iPod war sehr revolutionär und es war nicht wie die anderen Musikabspielgeräte. Ich habe schon gesagt, dass es viele Versionen gibt, aber es gibt auch viele Ausgabe des iPods. Diese Ausgabe heißen Generationen. Jede Generation hat andere Funktionen und eine andere Formgebung. Mit diesen Generationen verkauft Apple mehr und es erneuert die Produkte.
iPhone:
Das iPhone ist ein Smartphone von Apple und es ist sehr erfolgreich. Das iPhone war das erste Handy mit einer “on-touch” Tastatur. Das Handy ist vergleichbar mit dem iPod Touch, aber es hat mehr Funktionen als der iPod Touch. Das iPhone war gleich sehr populär durch die Formgebung und die Benutzerfreundlichkeit. Das iPhone hat fünf verschiedene Generationen und das sind noch nicht alle Generationen. Es hat also sein eigenes Betriebssystem, IOS. IOS wird auch für das iPad und den iPod Touch benutzt.
iPad:
Das iPad ist ein Tablet-Computer und wurde in 2010 herausgebracht. Es ist auch sehr modern und einfach. Die Idee war schon sehr alt, aber der Tablet-Computer war nicht populär. Das änderte sich mit der Vorstellung des iPads. Das iPad ist sehr erfolgreich, durch den großen Bildschirm und das leichte Gewicht. Man kann es sehr einfach mitnehmen und darum wird es oft für sachliche Zwecke gebraucht. In diesem Moment gibt es vier verschiedene Generationen  des iPads. Aber es gibt auch noch eine andere Version. Diese Version heißt  iPad mini und das ist eine kleinere Version.
Marketing:
Apple macht nicht viel Werbung, aber Apple ist doch sehr erfolgreich. Der Grund warum Apple nicht so viel Werbung macht, ist weil das Produkt sich selbst verkauft. Bevor Apple erfolgreich war, brauchten sie viel Werbung, aber das brauchen sie jetzt nicht mehr. Die Leute sind sehr positiv gegenüber Apple und sie sagen das einander. Diese Werbung heißt Mundpropaganda. Das ist für Apple sehr lukrativ weil es nichts kostet. Dadurch gibt Apple nicht so viel für Werbung aus wie andere Betriebe. Aber wenn sie doch Werbung machen, ist die Nachricht sehr einfach und kurz. Apple tut das, weil sie glauben, dass die Leute sich an die Werbung erinnern und darüber nachdenken. Der Slogan für den iPod war: „1000 Songs in der Tasche.“ Der Slogan ist sehr einfach und die Leute verstanden was Apple damit meint, darum ist der Slogan sehr Aussage kräftig. Apple benutzt die Nachrichten auch für die Werbung. Apple hat viele Rechtsstreitigkeiten mit Samsung und das ist auch Werbung. Die Rechtsstreitigkeiten sind über Urheberrechtschutz und es ist oft in den Nachrichten.
Zukunft:
Seitdem Steve Jobs Apple wegen Gesundheitsproblemen verließ, hat sich viel geändert. Apple beschäftigt sich mit der Produktion neuer Produkte und der neue CEO, Tim Cook, will nicht, dass die Geheimnisse durchsickern. Apple interessiert sich sehr für Apple TV und die iWatch. Apple versucht kreativ und originell zu sein und darum experimentieren sie mit neuen Produkten. Apple will die Konkurrenz schlagen und erfolgreich bleiben. Für die iWatch zum Beispiel gibt es großes mediales Interesse. Es gibt Gerüchte dass die iWatch gegen Ende des Jahres herausgebracht wird, aber das ist noch nicht sicher.

My mother got her citzenship trough the Italian Consulate in Brazil. I´ve got mine in italy, moved to there for a couple of months .

You will need to get all the birth certificates, specially the one of your italian ancestor (yes, in italy) , their marriages certificates. 

Will need to translate them all to italian( not the italian birth certificate, obviously) go to the Italian consulate responsible for your area, legalized it so it becomes oficial in italy, then you can do as me, get a lawyer, go to italy, wait...And done.

By naturalization I mean getting a citizenship of other country. Like in usa, when a foreign lives there for long years, then he can become a american citizen, get the right to vote and stuff. Like Schwazenegger. If any of your italian ancestors did that, you cant get the citizenship.

And to your question, do you want a serious answer? There are many possible ones :

- The Maltese-speaking population is indeed quite small. So by this metric, yes, it is ""inferior"" as in ""less able to reach a large part of the audience"". French, German, Spanish, in this context and with this metric were superior. None of them beat English.

- French and German are the official language of several different EU countries. Spain allows to reach a big part of Latin America. While I think English is preferable, these language can be argued to make sense in the EU parliament.

- Maltese translators are less common. How many of them even exist, in a population of 400,000 native speakers?

And I agree with that. My point was simply that many of them arrived at that time.

&gt; You can't point to one group and say it is their fault because this other minority group integrated ""fine"".

I'm not saying it's only their fault. I'm saying that there are many more precedents for the opposite to happen (minorities successfully integrate), therefore we cannot say that it's that society which they live in which is somehow making them fail integration. In other words: you're saying we cannot say it's only their fault, I'm saying we cannot say it's only the society's fault -so can we agree that there are mutual failures here? 


&gt; On top of that, is this some sort of end stage? If a group hasn't integrated by now it must be their fault? Why pick this arbitrary point in time.

No, of course not. The only reason we are discussing this is because we live in an age where discussion about this is encouraged (and enabled by such platforms as Reddit). And I believe this is a good thing.


&gt; What I am not saying is that this is all the Europeans fault, they are just awful and racist and mean. No. I am just not going to listen to Europeans saying the same thing about Roma, that it is all their fault.

I understand though that you're proving the forceful segregation part -OK, I have to accept that part... And I'm not sure what is the right solution in that case. While we may agree that if there's no integration in school that's damaging to society -on the other hand, I would definitely move my kids to a different school if such integration would be tried where it would affect them. The reason is simple: I went to school with gypsies, I saw what kind of behavior and habits they bring from home and I will not let my kids live through the same.


&gt; The point is that it takes time and it's only very, very recently you can reasonably expect the clock to start ticking. If you win 20%+ every generation you're still talking damn near a century for complete integration.

Well... I'm not convinced about this, simply because... Why is this a problem with them, while it isn't with other minorities? It's impossible that they would've been kept back on purpose, that for centuries all decision makers were racists... I guess there must have been faults on both sides?


&gt; This can't even be serious. I just showed you a huge number of examples of discrimination and abuse across multiple centuries and there's a lot more where that came from.

Are you saying that hundreds of years of slavery and systemic, legalized racism equals to some criminals being violent against the roma, or to being segregated in school? I don't think this is right...


&gt; It's only in recent years that Europe has even attempted to properly integrate the Roma, and even then (as my examples show) there were some serious flaws.


All ages tried in their own ways -much of which is not acceptable today of course, but there's no lack of trying... But there's a lack of result, while in many other cases this question was solved a long time ago.

2. What kind of visa do you want to use for your stay? Most foreign students I know are only allowed to work at university jobs (which can yield 300 - 500€ / month). Sometimes there are securities required for the visa. You should call up he german embassy in AUS and ask them about the visas. 

3. Depending on the city living costs are relatively cheap in Germany. Most universities offer a free puplic transport ticket for the city and state, included in the tuition. So you can get around a little bit for free. The 3000€ /year for rent should check out in most cities. It can of course vary with the city or the sort of accomodation you choose.  If you cook yourself or eat at the uni cafeteria, meals wont break your neck. Anyways I would take the chance to travel around in germany and europe, which means you need some money. Health insurance is about 70€ /month for students.

4. State-Support for students (whithout rich parents) maxes out at 670€ /month, +184€ child-benefits at under 25. This comes out at roughly 10k€/year. While you cannot have a luxurious life with that kind of money, there are many students who survive with the sum (and if you manage it right, you can definitely afford some perks) . This of course can be harder in munich, where life is expensive, than somewhere in the east. 

5. Are there scholarships availible? Are there organisations in Aus, that offer scholarships for students going abroad?

The company wanting to hire you needs to prove to the Spanish Employment Authorities that you have world-class, unique skills that no European Union citizen has. But apparently that's not enough. IIRC at some point in the past Varsavsky tried to hire some US engineers that had specific experience developing firmwares for a new model of router platform that his company Fon wanted to re-brand and sell. Their request was denied because there are some unemployed telecommunications / electronic engineers in the EU.  Their allegations ""But no one in the EU has experience working with the new XYZ CPU on the new ABC architecture and I have 1,000,000 units waiting to be re-branded and distributed to my customers"" didn't make a difference.

Having said that, not all EU countries are that strict and you could try and make use of your MBA in Germany for example, if you find a company willing to hire/sponsor you.

It's just not the right place to find that kind of drug. I'm not playing with stereotypes, I hate them as much as you. But it's more likely to find hash around a heavy metal bar, cocaine around an expensive club, speed around punk bars or techno clubs... without trying hard... and still everyone would probably smoke hash. This is a fact we all spaniards know but maybe it's not that well known by a foreign. What are the chances of seeing somebody doing cocaine in the bathrooms of a heavy metal bar vs the ones at night club? That's what I'm talking about.

1. Costi: dire che l'Open Source e' meglio solo per i costi e' la visione piu' miope di tutti. Tanto l'italiano medio pensa ""sticazzi, tanto Office e Windows li scarichiamo tarocchi"".

In primo per coerenza e per dare l'esempio, secondariamente per conoscere veramente di cosa cazzo stai parlando, e terzo perche' ti piace.

1. Grillo o non Grillo: basta parlare di Grillo. Il discorso dell'altro topic e' venuto fuori perche' uno dei deputati eletti aveva un Mac. Nonostante fosse un neo-laureato che sicuramente non navigava nell'oro. E che quindi aveva preferito spendere almeno un 50% in piu' per un MacBook bello sborone invece che prendere un portatile normale e metterci Linux.

Insomma. A me questo Movimento 5 Stelle mi sta simpatico, mi incuriosisce, mi fa ben sperare. Pero' ogni volta che vado un attimo nel dettaglio delle cose, soprattutto quelle che conosco, vedo che spesso parla di cose di cui non sa un cazzo ed una volta aperta bocca agisce comunque come vuole.

E' la stessa cosa che mi capita quando vado a vedere Grillo: quando parla di cose che non conosco dico ""Oh cazzo, incredibile, non lo sapevo, bisogna fare qualcosa!"", poi quando parla di qualcosa che conosco (Open Source, Ebook reader o roba simile) dico ""No, veramente non e' per niente cosi', hai capito il 25% e l'hai girato come ti pareva"".

For all of you saying that France is not a good place for a start-up, thing again considering how much money you can save (I build my start-up three years ago, so it's actually what we get for real):

- first, if you worked for at least 2 years, you have gain full insurance against unemployment. With a recent (4year old) law named ""rupture conventionnelle"", you can quit your current job and get that insurance from ""Pole Emploi"" - roughtly 80% of your salary for 24 month. The good part is that you can get it even if you start a business (but only for 15 month). You are 3 cofounders, Pole Emploi give you something like 1800€ a month =&gt; that's more than 80 000€ not spent in a serie A funding, and 15 month to test and build your idea (ok, I do expect that it's more like 2/4 month for the business plan and a first proto, and then some time to pivot/raise money/find clients/etc, but well, you get the idea: you have time to try/test/learn/correct)

- next, if you are doing a start-up, you are really likelly to be elligible for a special status, ""Jeune Entreprise Innovante"" (young innovating companie). That more or less makes you don't pay taxes for 7 years (no taxes for 3 years, then a decressive reduction for the next 4 years)

- then, you are likelly to be able to get the ""CIR"" - Credit Impot Recherche, which is a negative taxe (France give you back money) for the salaries given to people doing R&amp;D. That pays ~30% of the time spent in R&amp;D (plus things like patents, technical surveys - yes, going to Devoxx is a technical survey, etc)

- then, you have a *really easy* (less than one or two week of work) subvention that you can get, called ""AIMA"" (Aide à la maturation de projet innovant - help for maturing inovative projects) that get 25k€ (available several time, once a time by 18 month is ok)

And that's only the most obvious and simple things you can get (what basically every technical start-up should go and get without any wonder), there is a lot of others stuff (that may require much more work, or more specialized business domain, like ecological one, nanotech, etc).

All in all, if you are a start-up, OK you will have some administrative tasks to do - but you also get 15 months of risk-free test, plus tens of thousand of euros from France. After the seventh year your life will be harder (full taxes, etc), but by that time, you should already be sold or have a running business, so... Well, France is just a really good place to start a start-up.

It is very trying, even for us Europeans, and the paperwork will drive you insane.

On the other hand: we don't regret it AT ALL. Life here is much more relaxed, the weather is wonderful and after 2 years of adjusting and building up our business, things are getting better and better.

Examples of insane bureaucracy:

- to rent a house, we needed a bank account, but to get the bank account, we needed a French address. 
- my husband's 'carte vitale' (obligatory health insurance) took nearly a year to get. Had he had an accident during that time, we'd have been in serious trouble. They told us it could take up to 3 months once we filed all the necessary paperwork. When I contacted them when the 3 months were nearly over, they told us it was probably still being processed. However, they could *not even verify* they'd actually received our dossier. The only thing we could do was wait until the 3 months were over. As it turned out, it had got lost in the mail.


Some tips:

- Try to get work here as soon as you arrive, even if it isn't really what you studied for. I started working in a restaurant at first (my knowledge of languages was a HUGE advantage, as many french people speak only French.
This allowed me to get to know the country, people, and made all the administration (getting a rental house, insurance, bank account etc.) so much easier.
- Check distances carefully. My home country is as flat as a pool table, so I wasn't used to distances and travel time being so off. If there's a big mountain in the way, 30km can mean a 2 hour drive.
- The french are extremely sensitive towards good manners. This is also why they have a reputation for being impolite themselves: if you're going to walk up to them and ask a question without at least saying ""Bonjour. Comment-allez-vous?"", they're going to assume you are an uneducated peasant, and will treat you likewise, which in turn seems rude to the unaware American tourist. Conversely, many doors open as long as you're generous with the Bonjours, the Mercis and the Au revoirs.
- Expats tend to stick together. 95% of our business is with Belgian clients, even though we don't look for them specifically. When starting a business, this can be a great advantage. On the downside, do not expect the locals to trust you right away. 
- There is this thing called *'l'apéro'*. Officially, it's just drinks-before-dinner with some friends. However, they tend to become very long, with lots of different little snacks. It is customary to bring some potluck snack/drink yourself, the rest is provided by the host. Do not expect to be able to eat anything during the dinner afterwards.

It depends on the city etc., but it's not uncommon for student accomodation in a dorm to run 200-300 Eur a month (that's 60-90 AUD a week). A room in a shared appartment is usually between 250 and 400 EUR. Also, cities (apart from Berlin) don't have such a nasty sprawl as Australian cities do, so this usually gets you a place pretty close (30min by train or less) to the city center/uni. Except for Munich. Rent's is Australian-standard there (400/month for a shared appartment)

Food prices are also a lot lower than Woolworth/Coles/Foodland, Australian ALDI prices are quite comparable. Alcohol is infinetly cheaper (0.75l of decent rum/vodka/... for 8-15 EUR = 10-19 AUD).

You can live as a student on 500-700 EUR a month if you don't splurge on partying every day. 500 is low end and you'll need a cheap accomodation but still allows for a fun life if you know how to budget and shop a lot at ALDI.
I know people who easily lived on 500 EUR a month and even saved money to travel and others who couldn't manage on 800 EUR.
The Bafoeg (a subsidized student loan for low-income students/families) is set to max 670 EUR, which is generally considered adequate for a student.

I'd say you'll be fine with 8k per year. 10k is quite comfortable and allows for a decent amount of partying and travel.

- Nicosia will impose a 9.9 per cent one-off levy on deposits above €100,000 in Cypriot banks and a tax of 6.75 percent on smaller deposits from March 19. The levy will generate €5.8 billion.
Depositors will be compensated by equity in the banks.
There will also be a tax on interest that the deposits generate.

- Cyprus has agreed to increase its nominal corporate tax rate by 2.5 percentage points to 12.5 per cent, which could bring in up to €200 million a year.
- The International Monetary Fund is expected to contribute to the rescue package, but the amount is still to be determined.
- Russia will likely help finance the programme by extending a 2.5 billion euro loan already made to Cyprus by five years to 2021 and reducing the interest rate, which is now at 4.5 per cent.
- Cyprus may be required to privatise the Cypriot telecoms company, the electricity company and the ports authority.
- Cyprus will have to downsize its banking sector, reducing it to the EU average by 2018. The size of the banking sector in Cyprus is more than eight times the size of the economy, compared to around 3.5 times in the EU.

&gt;Although Christianity affirms that the Pentateuch is part of Scripture that is inspired of God, Christian tradition, in this case similar to Jewish tradition, denies that all of the Old Covenant still applies directly to Christians, but different arguments are used to reach that conclusion and there are differences of opinion within Christianity as to which parts, if any, still apply. The predominant Christian view is that Jesus mediates a New Covenant relationship between God and his followers, according to the New Testament, which ended or set aside some or all of the Old Covenant.

true,plonspfetew,null,null,"I am not a lawyer nor otherwise an expert on this matter, so let me just tell you what I think I know to get you started with your own research.

1.) Just to clarify, do not take the expression ""get a passport"" too literally. Having a German passport is neither necessary nor sufficient for citizenship. As far as I understand it, you *are* already a German citizen, although it *may* depend on the year you've been born. That means you should be able to waltz in the German embassy and request a passport. As having a German mother (as of 1975) makes you a German citizen, it might already be sufficient to show her birth certificate and yours. In any case, I suppose the German embassy is the place to go and talk to. They should (must?) help you with this. 

2.) There are some English language study tracks (often called ""international""), although most are at the Master level. A German citizen with Hochschulzugangsberechtigung (Hochschulreife) probably won't have to take any language tests, but of course, it would help in any case.

3.) Except for a few private colleges, the SAT is completely irrelevant in Germany, at least for those with a regular Hochschulreife, which is usually (traditionally) based on a German Abitur. Germans are a bit peculiar about the Abitur and have only recently begun to warm up to the idea that you don't need to be fluent in Latin to study applied engineering (I'm exaggerating slightly). I suppose a good starting point would be to visit the website of the Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD, German Academic Exchange Service), which is responsible for coordinating academic exchange. While you're not interesting in becoming an exchange student for a single semester, the information of their website should be of great interest to you, in particular about the requirements. https://www.daad.de/en/

A) It depends on the kind of work and the kind of company. From what I've heard soft where and multi national companies tend to use English more often as the working language in their company, even if their presence in English speaking countries is relatively small. But don't bet on this being the case. Additionally, if you want to work in the service sector such as bars, taxi drivers, cashiers, you get the picture you're going to *need* to know the native language to at least B1 under the [Common European Framework of Reference aka CEFR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages)

B) Speaking of languages, you'll want to head over to /r/languagelearning to ask them how much of what ever language you can learn in any given time is. They're always very helpful and usually offer reasonably good advice and plenty of resources to get good in the given time frame. You'd be amazed how good you can get if you have enough time, especially if it's a Western European language like Spanish or German as opposed to an Eastern Slavic one like Polish or Russian.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"Look at a *good* currency union, the DDR and the former West Germany (BRD). The DDR, had lower competitiveness (probably lower than Greece, Portugal etc), but, they had several other things going for them. No foreign debt, complete banking union and a guarantee that the banks would be OK, permanent transfers from BRD to keep the social system going when the unemployment went up due to lower competitiveness (as in unemployment benefits, minimum standards in school, health care, etc), investment from companies and the german government and *huge* popular support. 

DDR has received *trillions* from BRD, and they are still receiving over 100 billion Euros each year. Yet, it is still noticable that the (former) DDR is not as competitive as (the former) West Germany if you look at the productivity and unemployment numbers. The gap is much, much smaller though. It has been 23 years, with the full support of a rich Germany, and the German population......

Now, compare that to (for example) Portugal. While not as uncompetitive as DDR, they do not have the benefit of no debt, a proper banking union, financial transfers to help out with social issues, willingess of other countries to invest, willingness of government to spend billions.......The Portuguese are doing the only thing they can do under the circumstances - cutting cost. I don't think anybody is saying that no costs should be cut, but as many people  correctly points out, other things need to happen too -but they are not. Nor will they actually - no one is willing to permanently transfer billions to Portugal, or take over their debt. So, for how long should the Portuguese keep going. DDR are not there in 23 years, I do not dare to predict how long it will take the Portuguese.

I am not saying that there should be a complete union. One can't force people in it and say - look, we need to be one country now, or l hand over 30 % of your GDP to the south. People haven't voted for that, they voted for a currency union, not a transfer/complete union. A thing like a transfer/complete union need to be democratic. Frankly, it is not going to happen, nor do I think it should against peoples will. So, the solution is either to soldier on, suffering, for x number of years - but for what? Or, take the fall, and start fresh. I know which one I would choose.

Beschädigt der Sprühlack (oder was das ist) den Lack, der ab Werk drauf ist? Rostet das dann schneller? Wenn ja, dann ist das natürlich ein gutes Argument. Wobei man dann natürlich immer noch weniger aggressive Lacke erlauben könnte. Aber vielleicht ist das schwer zu unterscheiden, ob das jetzt ein böses oder ein gutes Graffiti ist? Keine Ahnung.

&gt; Weil es gefährlich ist. Niemand könnte überprüfen, wie die Sprayer sich auf dem Betriebsgelände der Bahn verhalten. (Von Versicherungsfragen ganz abgesehen.)

Auf dem Bahngelände rumzutoben ist jetzt schon verboten und kaum kontrollierbar. Glaubst Du, daß sich das durch Dekriminalisierung irgendwie ändern würde? Wieviele Sprayer werden denn auf ihren Streifzügen verletzt oder getötet?

&gt; Weil die Bahn das Recht hat, ihre Fahrzeuge entsprechend der Corporate Identity zu gestalten.

Wie gesagt, die Bahn gehört mir und Dir und 80 Millionen anderen. Wenn die Mehrheit langweilige Einheitszüge schöner findet, und dafür auch die gesteigerten Instandhaltungskosten (Was kostet das überhaupt?) bezahlen möchte, find ich das zwar immer noch bescheuert, aber damit kann ich dann leben. Mich hat aber noch nie einer gefragt, wieviel Geld ich für Corporate Identity ausgeben möchte.

&gt; Weil es ein Willkürverbot gibt. Wenn S-Bahnen in öffentlicher Hand besprüht werden dürfen, warum nicht auch das Rathaus? Oder die Fahrzeuge der Stadtverwaltung? Sozialwohnungen, Arbeitsämter, Parkbänke, Wasserwerke etc.

Ja, warum eigentlich nicht? Natürlich ist das Recht auf gestaltung des öffentlichen Raumes, das ich mir hier wünsch, ein sehr niedriges Recht. Man sollte zum Beispiel keine denkmalgeschützten Gebäude besudeln dürfen. Und bei Wohnungen sollten vielleicht die Bewohner bestimmen dürfen. Aber mir fällt grade kein Grund ein, warum eine Parkbank um jeden Preis in Jägergrün gehalten werden muß.

&gt; Wer entscheidet, wie die Gestaltung aussehen soll? Mir gefallen vielleicht schwarze oder kackbraune Waggons besser als bunte Graffiti. Bäckermeister Müller will vielleicht lieber Bilder von leckeren Brötchen auf der S-Bahn sehen. Von politischer oder religiöser Propaganda sprechen wir noch gar nicht.

Wer entscheidet das denn jetzt? Allermeistens Leute, auf die man als Bürger keinen Einfluß hat. Wenn jeder gestalten darf, dann sind halt heute lustige Männchen auf den Wagons und morgen Brötchen und übermorgen hat jemand Schimmel auf die Brötchen gemalt und die Werbung geht nach hinten los. Dann kann jeder bestimmen, wie's aussehen soll. Die allermeisten interessiert das sowieso nicht.

Und wenn's Dir tatsächlich darum geht, daß irgendwas irgendwem nicht gefallen könnte, dann können wir öffentliche Verkehrsmittel gleich ganz verbieten, einen breiten Konsens wird's da nie geben.

On second thoughts, that might be a motivation for the EU/IMF in this. They get to close a tax haven down. The problem is that money will just go elsewhere (Gibraltar/Lux/Switz?

The proposed legislation would nix the majority of technological hurdles and allow police to connect internet browsing activities with the identity of the person doing it. 

I am also not clear about what the article means when it says ""passwords."" It probably means passwords which you have created to secure your account with the ISP. That could mean, I suppose, a password to an email account you have with them.

The bill has been rewritten with some civil protections installed... but the intent of the bill seems to have always been to give the police a free hand when it comes to spying on the general population. Even in the rewritten version, it appears that there's this overbroad clause ""threat to public order"" which allows this sort of research to be done on a person.

Exactly like having 5 mini-markets (kiosks) in the same street just because one of them is making lots of money *doesn't* work.

The reason for this is very simple: *Nobody wants to admit that they fucked up the bailout for Greece* (although they vaguely acknowledge the mistake). So what do they do? More of the same stuff they said they would never do again. If all countries had exactly the same taxation, everyone would be based out of the strongest country: likely Germany, France or the UK. Unfortunately the actual mistake in ""tax avoidance"" is in the EU laws/regulations. The EU more or less allows for this thing to happen. Do you want a solution to this? it's gonna take a dramatic change in the way the EU works -- and the best way to accomplish this will likely be a federal state of some sorts.

So if your argument is only the taxation, you are more or less against the concept of businesses in Cyprus, and you are mostly just playing into the propaganda behind denial: various people made mistakes and are trying to dodge blame.

So yeah.. you get businesses/money out of Cyprus.. they are still not gonna move to your country.

&gt;they [Cypriots] probably got smaller taxes

Cypriot income tax goes to a max of 35% (very low). As you say, its better because of the expat / foreign rates (10-15%). Further supporting you, income tax begins at €19,500 (very high).

If Cyprus now loses foreign tax income, or if it closes its tax loopholes altogether, what happens to Cypriots? Surely their taxes rise to counter this drop in revenue (and to further bail them after this). They won't be happy about that, they aren't happy about this.

The problem I have with Angela Merkel is that when she was Minister of Environment (Umweltministerin) in the last Kohl government, she signed of on the depot for atomic waste known as **Asse**, in Lower Saxony. She disregarded reports indicating that the old Salt mine was not safe from flooding and that the risks of groundwater contamination are severely high. One would think that the ministry of environment could connect the occurrence of salt with the occasion of water flow. 

**I do so, thus i accuse her of malevolent intent.**

 The first Asse depot has already caved in making the atomic waste deposits there something of a permanent installation. The second one was being opened as countless reports state higher radiation in the vicinity of Asse and of flooding in the first depot.
Because of the ""apparent"" success of Asse two more installations have been expanded (Gorleben and Morsleben). Having been originally declared as transitive and safe storages until the real (endmülllager) final depot would have been found, it has been clear for the past 12 years that the depots have flooded, caved in, are leaking, salvage has become impossible, the declared limits have been overcome, the substance in the depots is much more radioactive than was declared, intended or allowed by the law, and to top it all of the friggin barrels are breaking down.

Ever since she has become Chancellor half-assed efforts to contain radiation have been part of the yearly blind activism for the sake of pr. Reports of exacerbation of the situation are being relativised. Even the events of Fukushima that force the government to make good on their legal obligation to move beyond atomic power has been reversed, reverse from the reverse and for no apparent reason caused a hike in energy prices. I seriously don't think Asse and her involvement with the atomic industry will even be a topic until the woman has died.


I get it. Schröder was a slave to Gasprom. Merkel is a slave to the atom lobby. There is no real alternative. The most over-advertised most subsidized most expensive and most harmful industry on the planet has bought Mrs. Merkel and the political will of her party for the sake of a competitive energy marketplace.

Oh, perfect. So if they ever come under financial strain, that gives everyone else free reign to punish them? 

&gt; Cyprus is a democratic republic, and as a result its citizens are not only liable, but also responsible for the consequences of their elected politicians' actions and decisions.

So, people having one vote every four years makes them totally liable for everything that happens?  By that logic, if the countries of the periphery revolt against the imposed policies and the whole system comes crashing down then the core countries who imposed said policies and their citizens would be fully liable for the aftermath?

&gt; No one forced Cyprus to become a financial hub without an industrial sector to compensate for fluctuations and risks in the global economy.

That's funny. The same could be said for the UK or the US whose financial industries are many times the size of their industrial output. But still no one is forcing them to do anything. Why don't you admit that this is just an issue of power play? 

&gt;  No one forced Cyprus to play dirty and become essentially a tax haven, thereby cutting into the tax revenue of other European countries.

Sure, that's right. Are you prepared to say the same thing for every other country that does not have taxes for things that it is morally fair to have taxes on? Do you hold the same opinion about Ireland? Do you hold the same opinion about the financial transactions tax? Or are these cases all about competition? 

&gt; When Allied bombers flattened German cities, Hitler was safe in his bunker, but those who did and didn't bring him to power perished in the fires. Thus is the nature of all republics.

Funny you should mention that. The countries that did not elect Hitler also suffered because of the war you know. What do you have to say to them about the nature of republics? What about the countries Germany and Italy occupied and whose population was starved? What about all the debt relief Germany got after the war? Isn't that a case of moral hazard? Starving other countries and then these countries helping you rebuild your economy?

In that case, forgive and forget was the motto of the day. Now, it's all about moral hazard and paying one's due. It's double standards. 

&gt; This would be the end of the European Union, and the resulting emotional rebound would give rise to a climate of fierce tensions, animosity, antipathy, and finally belligerent rhetoric and action. We'd basically go back to 1914. I exaggerate, but this would be the rough direction.

&gt; What was different about Greece c.2007 (public expenditure, national debt, government deficit/surplus) vs Latvia c.2007?

What this means is was the pre-crisis situation in Latvia different to the pre-crisis situation in Greece (this could be any other country in which austerity is not succeeding).

As an example, Greek debt-gdp was -6.5% in 07, whereas Latvia's was -0.4%. However, we also know that Greece, under the advice of the IMF and DSK, tried to spend its way out of recession in 2007. It started austerity in 2010, when debt-GDP was -10.7%. We can add to this that Latvia's debt-GDP hit an all time high of -9.8% in 2009, which is still not as bad as the Greek situation before austerity even began.

Given this statistics (and many more as this isn't the only measurement), was austerity likely to be more successful in Latvia than Greece? Or, is austerity likely to work quicker in Latvia than Greece because the situation was never as bad.

If we are judging the success of austere policies, then it must be a fair comparison. Two things we know for sure are:

* Greece started from a worse position, so austerity would always be tougher for their population. We can add therefore, that a worse starting position means it will take Greece longer to recover than Latvia. 

* Latvia has been doing it for 3 years longer. We can compare Greek austerity c.2013 (3 years in) to Latvian austerity c.2010 (3 years in). But to compare Greece c.2013 to Latvia c.2013 is a poor comparison because that's 6 years of Latvian austerity vs. 3 years of Greek austerity. That makes Latvia look better, but its unfair to Greece.

Legally speaking, you already have dual citizenship, and you are allowed to keep both for life. This means that you can live and work in Germany without having to apply for a visa. You are also just as eligible for financial assistance called BAföG as any other German citizen. ( http://www.bafoeg.bmbf.de ) So yes, just get a passport.

You will need a Hochschulzugangsberechtigung (Hochschulreife), basically an equivalent of the German Abitur, which has nothing to do with your citizenship. To decide what is ""equivalent"" to an Abitur, all Universities I have contacted follow the guidelines of the DAAD: https://www.daad.de/deutschland/nach-deutschland/voraussetzungen/en/6017-university-admission-and-requirements/ . Your country of origin for that page is the US, as that is where you went to high school (I assume). Therefore, the SAT, ACT, or your previous time at a university are very relevant. Please ignore those who say they are not.

You will need notarized copies of anything you need to apply, such as your high school diploma, transcripts, SAT test scores, etc., but you can just bring the originals and get notarized copies made here. The university will probably accept everything in English (French or Spanish), but ask first. It will more than likely say on the university's website what languages they accept, English being the big one.

Whether or not you have to take a German test, either the DSH (offered by the university) or TestDAF (nationally standardized), is up to the university. I would bet they will require it, but it's something you can take there. Don't worry, they aren't horrible.

Keep in mind, as a German citizen, you can move there and immerse yourself in German before taking the test, or even applying for anything. Get in contact with the university beforehand, though, to make sure you have everything you need to apply, such as an SAT, ACT, etc. You can also take the DSH prep course offered by the university the semester before your degree starts, if you would like.

India is already one of the most populous countries on the world, the population density is already greater then the Netherlands, India however is an entire sub-continent. It is estimated the population will continue to grow quite quickly for the next 20 years or so making it the most populous country in the world with an enormous population density. Meanwhile the inequality is high, and the amount of poverty is extreme. 800 million people (let me fucking repeat **800** fucking million people) live on 2 euro a day or less? Poverty is correlated to making many babies, wealth (or relative wealth) lowers this, this is why estimates for population will be stable in some time when more countries become wealthy. India however is still a third world country for most of the people living there, and I doubt the wealth will accessible to many of those now living in poverty continuing their habit of having many babies. 

My conclusion therefore is India has quite some chance on having bred itself checkmate. poverty, population growth, inequality will continue to exist while resources remain scarce.

There was a lot of truth in what you and the other poster were saying, but the way you view the people and the (probably sarcastic) solutions you were coming up with were kind of Hitlery. 

Part of the reason people get very scared by the growth of the human population is because people see each of these 7,000,000,000 (Hope I got that right) people who are alive and the ones who will be alive soon, as a problem, as a mouth that needs to be fed. This is a bad way of looking at population growth. A better way of looking at population growth is to think of that seven billion and realise that each one of those numbers is a person who will contribute to the world (probably) and find ways to feed himself.

Antonela Costache and Viorica Dinu, the two Bucharest Court judges charged with bribe-taking and intercession, were placed under 29-day preventive arrest. According to the prosecutors’ wiretaps, the two tried to intervene in order for businessman Nelu Iordache to be released from jail.

Viorica Dinu:

And you share it. I’ll give more to her if only she agrees, and there will be less for me and Ioana. If that’s not possible come tomorrow and I’ll give them to you and at any rate I’ll give her the difference and I’ll tell her there are 55 in total.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"Well the main thing to keep in mind is that in the UK system we have a fusion of the Executive and the Legislature. In most people's minds these two things are intrinsically separate because that's how it is in the US. In the US the President is not a member of the Legislature. I.E the President does not sit in House of Representatives or the Senate. In the UK, the head of government (Note, not head of State. That title is the Queen's) which is the Prime Minister does sit in the Legislature known which in the UK is parliament. Parliament in the UK has two houses. The House of Lords which is full of politicians **appointed** by the PM. The House of Lords is largely irrelevant as the other house of Parliament can overrule the Lords (part of the Parliament Act). The lower, but more powerful, house is the House of Commons. The PM is a member of this house. For intents and purposes let's imagine that the House of Commons is exactly the same as the House of Representatives (I'm assuming every one knows how that works, vaguely). Every Member of Parliament (MP) who sits in the House of Commons is elected by a constituency based on a plurality vote (whoever gets the most votes in that constituency gets to be its MP, note, plurality =/= majority). Anyway there are 600 constituencies in the UK which means we have 600 MPs. MPs are nearly always members of a political party and that political party has a whip which will try to force all party members in the Commons to vote a particular way. After a general election one Party usually (but not always) has a majority. If one party has a majority they all vote on who should be the next Prime Minister. If one MP gets over 300 (out of 600 MPs) of MPs to say he should be PM the Queen will invite this MP (let's call him David) to form a government. David is now the Prime Minister and in charge of the Executive branch of government. He will proceed to appoint Ministers to run various departments &amp; ministries of Government.

- CDU/PCP/MRPP (basically a Portuguese Communist Party), first rulers after our revolution, fucked the whole working industry in my town for example before ""rich people held it"". We do not have industry anymore. Also, commies.

- PNR (all the radicalist, xenophobic shit), small, like less than 1%.

- Green's party (again, no power whatsoever)

The top two, PS and PSD, hold more than 60/70% of the votes every time, so if you want ""change"", you have to vote for the oposite of the one in power...

Ideally I would like to agree, but realistically I have severe doubts. It won't stay 7 billion for very long and People do not just want to survive, we want more then that in these times. Translate this to food and we want more meat and other luxury foods. nutrient wise this costs more resources then just plant nutrients. The oceans are almost empty compared to 100 years ago. Desertification (climate change), depleting aquafires and some dumb farming practices are destroying a lot of acreages used to feed these mouths. phosphor an element that has enabled agriculture on many poor nutrient soils to prosper is depleting as well. In India the huge population has resulted in much urban housing on rich soils. That in this way can no longer feed these people. Average acreage per farmer is low, land costs are high, and so modern farming techniques are hard to implement. Now already people are inhabiting the steep weak Himalayan mountain slopes, farming on these extreme small pieces of land. 

Regardless I do think we will be able to feed the world, it will just be hard.

Countries like UK and Nordic countries and Western Europe countries were Protestant. For them profit was seen as a product of hard work to be enjoyed. They accepted people with skills from other religions and saw progress and increase in productivity as prestigious. 

I feel sorry for my fellow Portuguese friends, by being in Europe they had so many opportunities and somehow are so poor.

IMO there's these four reasons.

* Language. Need I say more?

* The trade: This is spured on by the cultural similarities and ability for our products to be sold in both markets

* WWI and WWII: The UK was a much more powerful nation then and saw the US as an equal rather than superior. The USA did likewise. They could both depend on each other in a way they couldn't with other European nations, such as France as it had a continuity issue.

* Attached to the above reason is that foreign policy was very similar. It was isolationist for a long time. Respect was built upon that idea and so was a sense of understand, at least for the diplomats who run both countries.

Ultimately I think the US-UK 'special relationship' is going to diminish. I think the US only sees us as special so long as we're a relatively big nation willing to agree with them, which we aren't always. They've liked us under the Bush administration as Blair was willing to support America fully in Iraq and Afghanistan, but now we both have more pacifists leaders we have lesser need to rely on each other. Additionally The UK and even USA are going to continue to become less and less economically significant and thus will have to make new trade deals, and alliances which will lessen our interdependence, or rather British dependence on America.

So in the end we'll be left with the cultural similarity, the language and maybe foreign policy, but that's not really going to be a special relationship, especially when you consider that more and more nations are going to have English as an official language. Virtually every one in Scandinavia and the Netherlands speaks English these days and that number is only going to grow. 

The US and UK will always be close allies (probably) but I don;t think we'll be special allies. I think that we'll get a lot of special allies and thus the importance of each other to each other will be diminished because of so many new relationships.",0,1363469937,null,0,false,0,c8wwr3y,t3_1afdt0,t1_c8wwr3y,t3_1afdt0,null,1431607439,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

You can use a browser plug in to use the US netflix from a Spanish connection. 

The rights management corp here (the sgae) is basically a heavily corrupt organism that lives off government subsidies, the higher the piracy rate the better the subsidies (they use to get a cut from every electronic device sold and now the government is going to give them a special tax directly)

there have been several attempts for online services and some work to some extent but tend to have old content, Netflix tried to lunch in Spain and they had to backtrack after the SGAE was asking for abusive tariffs on copyright royalties, they couldn't turn a profit in Spain. 

There are alternatives, you can get satelite TV, its around 40 euros a month for a basic package and they have on demand streaming, but its a joke price wise since the on demand service is around 5-6 bucks per movie. 

My advice, find a nice private tracker and download your stuff, i know it feels unnatural because of the emphasis put on it in the US about illegal downloading, but in Spain its legal as long as you dont redistribute or resell.
