- The EU’s rules must apply equally to all member states (= a la carte for the UK: forget it).
- While self-restraint is a good thing, repatriating powers on a large scale would be an altogether different matter. I fear that, as Goethe put it in his famous poem Der Zauberlehrling (The Sorcerer’s Apprentice), we might be conjuring up forces that we can’t control. (Dear Sorcerer's apprentice Cameron: start behaving like an adult please, thank you very much indeed).
- We firmly believe that there is one overriding lesson to be learnt from the financial crisis and the process of globalisation: we need more, not less Europe. (Dream on, Cameron about less Europe)

And the final zinger:

- One thing, however, is not negotiable from Germany’s point of view. For us the European Union is far more than just a single market; it is a community united for peace and the shaping of our common destiny.
(Dear David, when the UK wants to be in the EU, that EU will entail more than only the single market you dream of. regards, Guido (and Angela)).",0,1359560890,null,0,false,0,c86a8m7,t3_17k7mg,t1_c86a8m7,t3_17k7mg,null,1431129485,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

It's their product, we only use it if we want it, they do can offer a shitty service but then they lose customers, to say that this isn't the case and that it should be the government deciding on what should be done is to ignore the impact of every government intervention in the market and to be literally insane, as you're continue to do the same mistakes while expecting different results.

You're looking at it from the wrong angle, we need to avoid the distortion from happening in the first place so that the only firms that get too big are those that are successful and that the could always fail if they prove uncompetitive (as to say, the government shouldn't subsidise them, shouldn't limit entry to the market, shouldn't try to make foreign goods more uncompetitive, etc).",0,1359564067,null,0,false,0,c86b7pc,t3_17i8pa,t1_c86b7pc,t1_c86b2lx,null,1431129959,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

First of all, it perpetuates the myth of the ""hapless"" Greeks being saved by the ""too generous"" Germans. This is outright racism and I hope I do not need to go into details about why this is an overly simplistic view. 

It also does not shy away from reproducing the caricature of ""public employees long accustomed to getting paid without working"", which by the way is also popular in Greece, even though the evidence points that this only ever applied to a tiny minority of public servants. 

Worst of all is this paragraph:

&gt; Study the Greek character and you will find a conundrum of contrasts. On the one hand, you have the caricature of the lazy, tax-evading shirker, sipping ouzo with his buddies in the taverna as he collects money for a no-show government job that his uncle got for him. On the other, you have a fighting spirit so fierce that even Hitler praised the Greeks' martial prowess after he was forced to divert six crack units of the German Twelfth Army to put them down: ""For the sake of historical truth I must verify that only the Greeks, of all the adversaries who confronted us, fought with bold courage and highest disregard of death.""

So, you take a caricature, mix it up with a historical anecdote and presto - you have studied the Greek character. The author uses this ""study"" to draw conclusions later on. 

Furthermore, he makes a big deal out of how the austerity policies have destroyed civil society, then does a 180 degree turn to claim that Greece's ""promises of action"" to the creditors are lies. So, is it too much austerity or not enough austerity? You can't have both. 

-----

While I'm all for portraying the tragedy that is Greece and highlighting the dangers of the pursued policies there, I think it's better that we keep our discussion civil and rational.

true,Mareeena,SHOL,Schleswig-Holstein,"I would say the best hiking is in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, (Rheinland Pfalz has quite a few too, but I haven't been to any there that I can think of off hand).

Here are some of my favourites:
Bavaria: Altmühltal-Panoramaweg, Oberallgäuer-Rundwanderweg 
BW: Schwäbische-Alb-Nordrandweg, Renchtalsteig

But if you are looking for a hiking location closer to the Netherlands, than the Saar-Hunsrück-Steig near Saarbrücken is pretty nice, and the Rheinstieg (from Bonn to Wiesbaden I think) is also a favourite.

For kayaking:
Bodensee (in BW)
Altmühl (Bavaria)

true,maese,null,null,"I'm sorry to say this, but your post is terribly inaccurate and shows a huge lack of understanding of how the Spanish constitutional system works:

&gt;Spain is not a federal state where it's clear what is the responsibility of the central government and what's for each state/lander

The constitution was not extremely clear on this point, but hundreds if not thousands of Constitutional Court decisions were delivered in the 80s that mostly shaped the competences corresponding to each. Proof is that almost no conflicts of competences between regions and state are heard by the C. Court right now, as opposed to the constant overflow of the 80s. 

&gt;the central government can give any ""competence"" (social security, education, etc.) to an autonomous community, but it keeps the power to legislate how it has to be done

No. The power to legislate on each matter depends on how it is constitutionally allocated (on the constitution and the subsequent CCourt decisions I mentioned before). Also, it is the autonomous community who decides what competences it wants to assume when they approve their fundamental laws (estatutos).

&gt;Also, the central gov. collects all taxes.

This is a common misconception. The competence over the different taxes ranges from 100% state to 100% community. In some the communities decide everything and keep all the money, in some they decide only on rabates and surcharges and keep part of the money, in some they administer the collection and keep the money, but do not legislate, etc.

&gt; and you also have to pay for the central Education Ministry

The autonomous communities obviously do not pay for the central education ministry. Taxpayers do, with the part of their money that is allocated to the central government.

&gt;This transfers a lot of debt to the autonomous community, and there's nothing they can do about it.

Actually, autonomous communities are much less indebted in gross terms than the central state. In other words, independently of where it comes form, their money needs vs. money actually received ratio is much better.

Tl;dr: I agree that the allocation of the expenses and incomes is far from perfect, but most of the things you stated are just wrong technically.

true,TheAngelW,null,null,"J'ai commencé à regarder le reportage, c'est pas mal, j'aime bien le style de la journaliste. Je donne les infos brutes sans commentaires ni vérification.

A l'origine dans le Coca il y avait de la cocaïne. L'inventeur a été inspiré par le [vin mariani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_Mariani), une décoction française de feuilles de coca. Aujourd'hui, les feuilles de Coca seraient toujours utilisées, pour le goût, mais après traitement pour enlever la cocaïne. Evidemment ça la fout mal, puisque la coca, c'est la drogue, et la drogue, c'est mal.

Autre ingrédient, le sucre. 10 cuillères à café par cannette. Des communes en Californie interdisent la boisson. Il existe une dépendance similaire à la morphine, l'alcool etc. Les conséquences pour les enfants sont particulièrement dramatiques. Un médecin spécialiste: ""Si vous fumez 2 paquets par jour, vous perdez 20 ans de durée de vie. Si vous buvez 2 canettes par jour, vous perdez à peu près pareil."" Et les édulcorants ? Scientifiquement on ne sait rien sur les conséquences potentielles.

Et puis il y a le colorant caramel, dont on a prouvé qu'il est cancérigène (leucémie). L'Etat de Californie a obligé les industriels du soda à limiter la quantité de ce colorant. En France on est bien au-dessus de cette limite.

Enfin, il y a l'eau, 3 litres nécessaires pour produire un litre de coca. Beaucoup de pompage donc sous les usines, souvent ce n'est pas payant, et avec des conséquences pour les autres utilisateurs des nappes, par exemple au Chiapas, au Mexique. Dans ce pays, on est devenu les plus gros consommateurs au monde. Grace à une stratégie commerciale ultra efficace (prêt de frigo etc.), il y a du Coca partout, jusque dans les rites traditionnels chiapas. En 2020 on prévoit que 100% de la population mexicaine sera en surpoids.

Conclusion, on sait pas ce qu'on boit, ou bien pour ce qu'on connaît, c'est pas terrible, et le secret permet à Coca non seulement de se faire mousser, mais aussi d'éviter de répondre aux questions, ce qu'il ont fait tout au long du reportage.

- Permesso da tiro sportivo

- Patentino di caccia

Il primo è relativamente semplice da ottenere (a patto di avere una fedina penale intonsa come le guanciotte rosee di un bebé). Costa in tutto -tra marche da bollo, burocrazia, visite, corso obbligatorio e tutto- sui 300 euro e lo rilasciano solitamente entro 3 mesi dalla presentazione in questura della domanda.

Il secondo è più ostico, poiché oltre al corso di utilizzo dell'arma c'è anche il test vero e proprio per prendere il patentino di caccia.

Le limitazioni non le so di preciso, ma mi pare che con il porto sportivo puoi registrare fino a 3 armi (corte o lunghe è indifferente) e un centinaio di pallottole, ma su questi limiti non ti so aiutare.

Well, I agree with you (if I can get over my hatred against the current CAP). I think we should slowly go over to a free market system, but I do understand that we would completely loose....

True!

 I have to admit that I ended up googling Bastiat - but I liked him. 

I am not naive enough to think that we are in a union (and frankly, I'd rather not be in one). However, I do think we should fulfill the promises we have undertaken towards each other. One of them is - to work together in certain areas for the benfit of all, and for the EU. 

One of those areas is the CAP. Well - why isn't France. I'd really, really like for the EU to have a punishment clause- they so much deserve it. The rest of us are actually trying - and compromising. I wonder what they are doing.

I spent 8 months in France on a long-stay visa in 2011. The thing to watch is that after 90 days ( the normal visa-free period) in the Schengen area, you will need an OFII vignette in your passport to re-enter the Schengen area. It's quite complex, but so long as you have a long-stay visa and your OFII vignette in your passport, you're free to go where and when you want.  

Organise your OFII vignette as soon after arriving as possible, it can take several weeks for the process to complete. You should have received the information and forms for the vignette when you received your long-stay visa.

L'homosexualité n'a rien de nouveau, ça a toujours été une pratique sexuelle minoritaire plus ou moins acceptée selon les époques.

La polygamie n'a rien de nouveau non plus : certaines cultures la pratiquent depuis des millénaires.

La pédophilie non plus remarque, le prophète lui même en est un parfait exemple.

Seul l'inceste trouve condamnation très tôt dans diverses civilisations de part le risque d'expression de tares portées par des allèles récessifs, compris depuis peu mais identifié depuis des millénaires.

Dans tous les cas, on est face à la problématique de reconnaissance d'une union par la société, et cette reconnaissance s'associe à des privilèges et des devoirs mutuels. Elle a pour but d'encadrer la construction d'un foyer, initialement au sens reproductif du terme, mais on veut aujourd'hui l'étendre à une pratique sexuelle, peu importe qu'elle contribue à la société par la reproduction ou non.

Cette reconnaissance est prétendument exigée par une minorité sous couvert d'égalité des droits. Qu'elle soit légitime ou non m'importe peu, le principe égalitaire abordé sous un angle extrêmement naïf ne me dérange pas tant qu'il est universel et pas hypocrite.

Ce qu'on essaye de nous faire gober là, c'est que les homosexuels sont plus égaux que les polygames, les pédophiles, et même les hétéros, puisqu'ils réclameraient des droits sans contrepartie, c'est à dire leur contribution à la préservation de l'espèce, de la société et d'un mode de vie.

Je ne fais que chercher une cause logique à l'octroi de privilèges (fiscaux et matrimoniaux en l'occurrence) qui soient réservés à une minorité sous couvert de non discrimination. La simple analyse de la prétendue revendication et de son contexte est antinomique avec le fondement même de l'institution que le gouvernement souhaite rendre accessible aux personnes homosexuelles.

La démonstration par l'absurde, notamment concernant la pédophilie, est osée, je le reconnais. Mais l'argumentaire pour le mariage de personnes de même sexe ne tient juste pas debout : si cette mesure se voulait égalitaire, se drapant de lutte contre les discriminations, alors on doit impérativement ouvrir le mariage à toute minorité, peu importe ses pratiques. D'où ma position : ce n'est pas un mariage pour tous, juste une diversion aisément médiatisée (en revenant à la forte représentation homosexuelle dans les médias).

Pour ma part, je reste convaincu que la reconnaissance de l'union de deux personnes ou plus dans un contrat civil est possible voir même souhaitable, peu importe la nature de l'union (sous seing privé), mais le statut marital (i.e. familial naturel) ne doit pas être dénaturé sous couvert d'une égalité naturellement litigieuse et incomplète.

Le projet de loi actuel est donc une merde qu'on nous pousse dans le gosier, condamnant aisément tout opposant à la calomnie pour délit d'opinion voir homophobie, et la bonne approche est en réalité d'étendre le périmètre de l'union civile en tenant compte de toutes les pratiques acceptables, c'est à dire à minima de la polygamie ou polyandrie et de l'homosexualité. Inutile de ternir une institution traditionnelle, naturelle, culturelle ou cultuelle par la même occasion, ce ne serait que déstructurant pour la société.

This followed an EU directive to promote recycling and stop electrical equipment being dumped in landfill sites. It was intended for goods such as computers or cellphones, but in the mind of one reporter it included vibrators.""

This is an ingenious way to create jobs. An industry revolves around propagating myths, so by necessity a new industry has to be created to counter myths. It would be merely an innocent game though, if it didn't lead to this:

""Such journalistic enterprise would be funny, said Bell, were there not so much at stake. Over the next 18 months, at least 10 EU countries will hold referendums on whether to adopt the new European constitution. Britain is due to hold its referendum in 2006, but the EU is so out of favor with the British public that the commission fears the opinion polls look disastrous. Rejection in just one country could send the EU into crisis.""

true,spartan2600,null,null,"&gt;It is the case that the Malian ""government"" did request assistance. But bear in mind that this ""government"" came to power as a result of a coup led by the military, whose coup leadership (especially Captain Amadou Sanogo) was trained by the U.S., and that the actual Malian democracy of the 1990s was consistently undermined by the West and the IMF, which inserted their own man to the prime minister's office in the early 2000s. Mali did not call for the intervention; the undemocratic and Western-backed coup regime's antecedents did.

&gt;The current President Dioncounda Traoré is only the acting president, whose installation to his current office in April 2012 was sealed with a promise to fight a ""total and relentless war"" on the Tuareg, giving in, therefore, to the Malian military's main grouse that led to the March 2012 coup in the first place. Traoré's first Acting Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra was removed by the coup leaders in mid-December 2012 and replaced by Django Sissoko, who presided over a regime dominated by the coup leaders. This is the government that invited the French into Mali. Sanogo's own political leanings can be gauged by the fact that he opposed the entry of a UN-authorized African force (staffed by ECOWAS), but welcomed the French bombardment.

Don't apologize for speaking English.

&gt; I was recently informed that France doesn't have funeral homes like we do in the USA

There are funeral homes in France and if there's not one around, the undertaker may offer this service in its premises.

&gt; and that funerals at churches are on a first come first serve basis 

Yup. But the church will only care about the ceremony, the rest is taken care of by the undertaker.

&gt;  that it is not unusual to have funerals in one's home

If you're talking about the little ""celebration"" after the burrying/cremation, definitely, I'd even say it's almost always like that.

&gt; How much might an average funeral cost in France?

Dunno as I never had to pay for that but it's definitely expensive here too.

&gt; I wonder how funeral customs and traditions in France differ from those in the USA.

I don't think it's really much different... From my own experience, I can tell you how it happened last time one of my relatives died and then you can compare to how it is in US.

So : When my uncle died, he was first taken to the hospital for a few enquiries (he had a weird accident so the police tried to see if it was criminal, turned out he just had a heart attack) then the body was put in the coffin and let for 2 days in small funeral home in the undertaker's premises. Then it was taken to the church where we had a small ceremony and the coffin was buried in the cemetery right next to the church where the priest said a few more words. Then we all went back to my aunt's house to eat and drink. That's all.

Other things you may want to know : Even if you want to be cremated, it's still expensive and you have to pay for a place in a cemetery as it's forbidden to keep a funeral urn at home.
You don't have the right to move a dead body by yourself and it's effin' expensive to have people doing it.

That is setting it up so that say France can enjoy a certain way of life without being concerned that Britain will undercut them and force them to compete.

The real problem today is the threat is not from Britain. France and Britain are not competitors on the grand stage yet the EU is still set up as if we are all mutually untrustworthy economic enemies.

The problem today is competition with China. The EU needs to look at itself and work out how the members can compete with China. I personally dislike the idea of dumping the WTD because I think it is unimaginative. However something must be done and it won't involve regulation between member states.

The truth is we need to reform the entire culture of the EU. It was designed as a system that threw out a wall to the world and regulated between nations in the EU as if they were the whole world. Now the EU is a block within a large global economy. Yet the trade rules are still set up as if France are worried about the UK or Germany out competing them. The entire European project should be concerned with China. Not each other.

That is what Cameron is trying to focus on but doing it badly. I think it is a mistake to take the British exceptionalist approach to this problem. It only reinforces the idea that this is Britain trying to screw France which isn't what it is about at all.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"This is a weird submission. It is an article, that references an article, that references a book that was published in 2008. The [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/White-Cargo-Forgotten-History-Britains/dp/1845961935/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1359626325&amp;amp;sr=8-1) is called ""White Cargo"". 

Here is the book synopsis:

&gt; In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 300,000 people or more became slaves there in all but name. Urchins were swept up from London's streets to labour in the tobacco fields, brothels were raided to provide 'breeders' for Virginia and hopeful migrants were duped into signing as indentured servants, unaware they would become chattels who could be bought, sold and gambled away.

It's the book on White Slavery that I have not yet read, the other being [White Gold](http://www.amazon.co.uk/White-Gold-Extraordinary-Africas-European/dp/0340794704/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_z), about the slave trade between Europe and North Africa, in which Barbary pirates kidnapped roughly a million Europeans from across Europe and North America, and sold them as slaves in North Africa. White Gold was very good, and I recommend it. 

What's weird is that although the book focuses on slaves taken from across the British Isles, English prisoners, street children, Jacobite Highlanders, etc, the articles focus solely on the Irish. 

Looks like it might be an interesting book. Here is the chapter list/description, taken from an Amazon review:

Chapter 1: A Place for the Unwanted: Elizabethan adventurers dreamed of an American empire that would give them gold and glory. Others saw the New World as a dumping ground for England's unwanted poor.

Chapter 2: The Judge's Dream: A highwayman who became Lord Chief Justice planned to colonise American with criminals. He began to empty England's gaols and set a precedent.

Chapter 3: The Merchant Prince: The mastermind behind the first successful English colony in America was reputedly Britain's richest man. He kept a fledging Virginia going and paved the way for the first white slaves.

Chapter 4: Children of the City: The Virginia Company wanted youngsters to work in the tobacco fields. The burghers of London wanted rid of street children. So a bargain was struck and hundreds of children were transported.

Chapter 5: The Jagged Edge: The New World was a magnet for the poor. To get there, they had to mortgage their labour in advance. They were not to know that they had contracted into slavery and might die in bondage.

Chapter 6: `They are not Dogs': Virginia was run by planters who pushed through laws that relegated ""servants"" and ""apprentices"" to the status of livestock. Notionally they had rights but planters were literally allowed to get away with murder.

Chapter 7: The People Trade: IN the 1603s, almost 80,000 people left England for the Chesapeake, New England and the Caribbean, most of them indentured servants. A ruthless trade in people developed in which even a small investor could make money.

Chapter 8: Spirited Away: Untold numbers were kidnapped or duped onto America-bound ships and sold as servants. The ""spiriting"" business became as insidious and organized as the cocaine racket today. Even magistrates took a cut of the proceeds.

Chapter 9: Foreigners in Their Own Land: Ethnic and religious cleansing in Ireland became a model for Native Americans being cleared from the Chesapeake. During the Cromwell era, still more were displaced and Ireland became a major source of slaves for the New World.

Chapter 10: Dissent in the North: During the 1650s, Scotland fought shy of transporting its unwanted to any English colony. Then religious and political dissent wer made punishable by transportation to the Americas. Sometimes more died on the way than ever reached the New World.

Chapter 11: The Planter from Angola: The idea that Africans were Virginia's first slaves is revealed as a myth through the story of one who became a planter himself and went on to own whites as well as blacks.

Chapter 12: 'Barbadosed': In the 1640s, Barbados became the boom economy of the New World. The tiny island's sugar industry would outperform all its rivals in profits - and in its ruthless use of slave labour.

Chapter 13: The Grandees: A planter aristocracy emerged in the Chesapeake. Its members dealt in men, land and influence, creating dynasties that dominated America for centuries. But stories of brutality deterred would be settlers from emigrating.

Chapter 14: Bacon's Rebellion: The planters' nightmare of a combined uprising by blacks and whites came true when a charismatic young aristocrat turned an Indian war into a campaign against his own class, the English grandees. Swearing never again, the grandees set out to divide the races.

Chapter 15: Queen Anne's Golden Book: Bogus promises of free land persuaded hordes of Europeans to sel up and leave for America. They began a nightmare journey that left some so impoverished they sold their children to pay the fare. But some outfoxed their exploiters.

Chapter 16: Disunity in the Union: Scottish clansmen were sold as servants in the Americas while their chieftains were allowed a comfortable exile in France - two different fates for Jacobites after 1715. Merchants made fortunes selling clansmen in six different colonies.

Chapter 17: Lost and Found: The tide of kidnapping continued under the Hanoverians. In two famous instances, victims returned, as if from the dead, to denounce their abductors. One claimed to be heir to an earldom, kidnapped by the man who stole his birthright.

Chapter 18: 'His Majesty's Seven-Year Passengers': After 1718, England subsidised the convict trade and America was deluged with British jailbirds. Paranoia grew, with soaring crime rates and epidemic blamed on convicts. Only employers were happy: a convict servant was half the price of an African slave.

Chapter 19: The Last Hurrah: Having won their liberty in the War of Independence, Americans had no intention of allowing their country to serve as a penal colony ever again.

Job situation: if you have valid (as in officially recognized as equivalent to the French degree) nursing degree, you have a job. Actually, you have many jobs. There's a great deficit of nurses in France, and each and every hospital, clinic, and medical partnership is always hiring. Or you can hang your shingle and go at it solo (more worries, but more money)

Two caveats though:

- you have to speak French decently.
- any foreign nursing degree that is not on the official list of equivalent degrees is worthless if you want to practice in France.

Nursing programs: French nursing schools are called « Instituts de Formation aux Soins Infirmiers » (IFSI). There is a nationwide *numerus clausus* on how many students they can have, and there is a competitive exam to gain entrance.

There is a specific competitive exam for nurses holding a foreign degree. If successful, you may be granted the French diploma without having to follow the French cursus. All this is described in the [official French law on the nursing degree](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020961044), articles 27 to 32 are the one relevant to foreign degrees.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Sweden can give up some of its CAP payments in favour to France and gain in another area of negotiation such as trade liberalization in other areas

You still don't get it do you? 

We are 27 countries, and if we have one agricultural policy, that policy should be *fair*. It is not *fair* when you have vairables in there, that makes no point at all for the cost or the end product. 

Instead of telling Swedes (Lithuanians, Poles etc) to negotiate better, why not ask yourself  why the EU isn't striving or even attempting to have a fair CAP? 

Shouldn't that be the goal, and those who fight against a fair CAP, should be the bad guys? Why are you defending what *is* discrimination, and makes no sense, for either a consumer, tax payers or just anyone who strives towards a fair world? Why not ask the French why fairness is out of the question? 

The amount of trees when grazing as a variable, makes no sense at all, as long as the cows are fed well, outside the same amount of time etc. 

If it is a variable one can't change (like the geography of Sweden) and has no bearing on the outcome - it *is* discrimination to have it there. It makes just as much sense to have it there as a clause that says anyone under 180 centimeters will get paid less. That would be obvious discrimination too. In that case you would never blame the Swedes/Eastern Europe etc for not negotiating well, you would say  - Fuck the French that  put that clause in. It is blatant discrimination, and has no bearing on the prodcut.

So, why can't you say that about other variables that makes no sense? 

At the end of the day, I want a sustainable, fair, agricultural policy. I want the policy to pay pay attention to what matters, like environmental issues, how the cow lives, the quality of the meat, and a billion other things, that I am sure I have forgotten. 

I do not want to pay attention too, nor do I want to pay for, variables that doesn't matter. Above all, I do not want to discriminate anybody, not even the French. 

And, at the end of the day that is what is happening. The Swedish farmer, get paid less, for the exact same product, because of a variable that has no bearing on the outcome. 

That, my friend, if you haven't realised it, is discrimination. And, that is horrible, and should always be fought against, wherever one sees it. ",0,1359636266,null,0,false,0,c86usvi,t3_17k4rs,t1_c86usvi,t1_c86uo5n,null,1431139404,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Mainstream society. It means a lot, growing up, to have heroes, ideals, values represented that include you, and make you feel at home in society.

As a gay man, for example, I have to ""come out"" every time I meet new people, and every single time, there's a risk that they'll dislike me or even hate me because of the fact that I have boyfriends instead of girlfriends. That's marginalisation — constant nervousness about not fitting in, about people not liking you *by default*.

Same for women — they have to constantly prove their worth in every context, and constantly risk getting reduced to looks instead of being taken seriously as intellectuals or professionals or even athletes.

It's easy to say that ""I don't care what anyone else thinks"", but not everyone *has* a spouse, or a close circle of friends that they never need to expand, or the perfect career that they never want to change.

But - for me at least - it that is not a club. It is mostly strangers.

&gt;It means a lot, growing up, to have heroes, ideals, values represented that include you, and make you feel at home in society.

You mean not actual people, but more like pop culture? Seriously man, pop culture is for the plebs. I thought we here are above that.   Personally I always considered modern society sick, so I had no intention feeling at home in it. Instead I read a lot of historical stuff because I think the past was better. Better for me, I mean, as I am a radically conservative aristocratist-monarchist. Probably not better for you... anyway.  Why don't you just live in your circles, like I do? Why do you want anything from that large mass of mostly stupid strangers we call society?

&gt;As a gay man, for example, I have to ""come out"" every time I meet new people

Why do you have to? It is entirely unprofessional to talk about private life to customers, vendors etc. And this is how we normally meat people, through work, business. Or do you mean like hanging out, trying to make new friends? This is what I said about having a too social life. Why would you or I want to meet new people outside work, business, professional contact? I made 3-4 friends in childhood, and that is always enough to have a barbecue. This is exactly what I told you about see society in a too social way, like an American college campus! There is really no need to care about anyone or talk to anyone outside your circles, expect professionally, because we all need the money. And for exchanging thoughts and learning stuff Reddit and other online stuff is better.

&gt;constant nervousness about not fitting in, about people not liking you by default

Again I simply don't understand why would you care about fitting in. This is like something extremely social to me.

It is basically like seeing society as a club instead of strangers. So it seems my guess is right that this all matters for those people who see it this way...

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;if the government KEEP the forest area, selling a few trees once in a while and then replanting, they will instead be able to gain a steady income and profit more over time.

State capitalism doesn't work like that, the private sector is much more efficient in doing that as it will never be under the unaccountability of the bureaucrats or under the pressure of special interest groups, which can't be said about state owned business.

Between the state keeping the forest area (which may or may not end up being a profit over the years) or the state selling it and allow the private sector to manage it (which will definitely result in a profit for the state) and then taxing this new business (which will guarantee a steady income and profit over it), the later is a much better solution, after all, it's not the role of the state to manage on these issues, the state ought to focus on what's really important and not spread all around trying to run the whole country for everybody.

&gt;Noone would be interested to buy the forest unless they thought that the move would generate profit.

Then if nobody buys it and privatisation is therefore not possible because there's nobody interested, I guess the state will have to support the costs. Though if there are people interested, the state really should take advantage and profit from the situation as there are much more important sectors for the state to allocate its resources.

&gt;And there is also the whole citizens wanting to be able to roam the forest.

I've been in private parks and nobody barred entrance, that would be bad for business. They charge for parking if you go there in your car, they charge if you want to eat something and they have a bar in there, they try to charge where they can, but they don't just say ""private property"" and not allow people to come it as then people would just go elsewhere and the owners would lose out on the small income they might otherwise get.

&gt;the new owners decide to cut ALL of it down

They can't do that. They have a cap on the number of trees they can cut per year.

Which is a good thing, they always do that because it's extra income and they also take the opportunity to clear the forests which makes them much safer during the Summer because of the forest fires.",0,1359642275,null,0,false,0,c86vtzd,t3_17md2c,t1_c86vtzd,t1_c86v8bz,null,1431139978,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

**Paid vacation.** There's no paid vacation. There's an annual salary for all the working days of the year minus a certain amount (24 is the minimum within the EU afaik). When you get sick the ECJ decided that those days do not count against that amount. Simple as that. It could have ruled otherwise. Maybe half/half between empoyee or employer would have been fairer. Maybe employee, employer, insurer, each for a third. The purpose of those days is for the employee to have a chance to shut down, spend time with their family, make a longer trip, things that actually increase morale and productivity. And the day when one is sick are not spent for the intended purpose. Yes, it can be abused. But not as much as when the employer dictates when you have the right to be sick and when not. The workers fought and spilled blood for the workers' rights. Throughout history it's not the employers that get abused and need protection.

**The car insurance example.** You are being pedantic. Meeting halfway doesn't in that case mean add the two and divide by half. It means adjusting proportionately. That's a straw-man argument. Some business-models became nonviable. Yes, they did. So?

**The hamster example.** ""The French can't decide what's right for their own hamsters now?"" You mean just like the Japanese protect the whales? And Australians protected dingos? You seriously see no sense in a higher authority deciding over such matters as endangered species, when local governments don't?

**The patent system.** The patent system is broken. Badly. It needs reform. May the unpatentable stem-cell research pave the way for much more radical reform.

All in all, you're cherry-picking. And cherry-picking is not the way to argue over the principle of the ECJ's existence. Your arguments only support its improvement, not its abolition.

An average Frenchman can probably name more British films (even excluding Bond films) than a Brit can name non-English language films.

France has that reputation and plays a lot on this. I work in tourism and those are definitely France's strongest assets. I'll say it myself, France is up there on top when it comes to cuisine and fashion. France is fairly objectively top notch worldwide in these things. Otherwise, Germans, Japanese, Americans, British all have their specific areas where they're better, and if I nagged an American guy about how the French movie industry is better than America's, the American would very understandably react the same way the French guy you're speaking about reacted when you compared French and British food. Because objectively, those industries aren't even in the same ball park. British food can be very good, no insult here, but France's reputation for food is so massive, Britain can't even try to compete. And that's not arrogance. It's just how it is. Otherwise Britain literally crushes France in terms of music and comedy for example.  ",0,1359644464,null,0,false,0,c86wc45,t3_17mj9e,t1_c86wc45,t1_c86vy8h,null,1431140264,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It's basically all badly acted pseudo reality TV, courtroom shows and people haggling for junk.  
And these people buy Game of Thrones from HBO. A premium piece of television with a per episode budget that could shame many German cinema productions. They pay a lot of money for something that just doesn't belong on their silly little network, have a rather meh dub made and then decide to properly fuck it all up by showing the entire season on one single weekend back to back. I don't even...what? If this amount of retard-ism is what's going on in German TV broadcasters higher management it's a miracle we occasionally get something good at all. It just boggles my mind.

Also I believe the problem with Sherlock or 30 Rock on ARD is that it's just so unexpected. ARD and ZDF are usually so far outside the interests of younger viewers (the people wanting to watch Sherlock and 30 Rock) that the target audience just wont notice. When looking for something to watch in the evening I don't even bother checking ARD and ZDF. 99% of the time it's just crap and oompah music and boring German crime shows and generally stuff my grandma would like. Something nice and calm and not too upsetting.

Precisely because all the non-local locals (i.e. the other migrants) tend to stick to their own circles, because most of them have rather rudimentary language skills, and the real locals are a bit tired of all the migrants by now so they stick to their circles too. It is not that they are closed-minded, it is that for example we did not grow up on the same sitcoms so we do not understand the same jokes, and so on, it is just awkward, not as much fun. I did hang out with some Cypriote Greeks in the UK because they just about as isolated and lonely as we were, but that was all. For example even in this case we did not really like each others music that much. Good as a curiosity but not like all the evening on every party at every second weekend...  for example half of the fun in music is lyrics, so this automatically makes partying a bit awkward when not everybody understands the language of the song.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There is a **huge mistake** in your analyis, I am afraid, and this is so frequent on Reddit and in the media, that I don't how to really get the message really through to everybody... I call it the **the fallacy of eating money** - i.e. thinking about income or wealth in purely monetary term and seeing it as the ""reward"". No, it is not.

So, we have contributions on one hand and rewards on the other hand. What is the real reward? Not money, not wealth, not income. The reward is **consumption**. It is **stuff**. This is what the economy is about: making stuff, distributing stuff. (And also services.) The **meaningful way to look at the inequality of rewards is the inequality of actual stuff consumed, not wealth or income**.

Are we living in a particularly inequal age when it comes to consumption?

I think not, and especially not when you don't measure consumption in simple monetary terms, because that is also a similar mistake: you cannot take a €100000  watch and make 1000 pieces of €100 watches of it, it does not work this way. What matters is **redistributable resources** because this is what makes sense to think about how it is distributd. Factors like brand names, the location of a house, or an expensive painting don't yield themselves conveniently to redistribution. Factors that can be conveniently redistributed are: work-hours, energy, natural resources went into making the stuff we consume. And here the inequality is huge between nations, but not in nations, especially not in Western Europe. 

One really convenient measure is **living space**: this is something most people like to have a lot of, and it is a huge item in every budget. We can say that from the poores to all but the richest, doubling the living space is one of the most important steps a family can have to get ahead. It is a huge reward.  Also because most of the stuff we buy goes in the living space. More rooms, more TVs. So it also approximates other consumption. This is why I love this measure.

Now, do we live in the age of nobility living in huge castles, while serfs live in a small, one-room hut with a family of 8? Hardly. Not in Western Europe at least.

The wealth difference between my boss (business owner) and me is vast when expressed in money. But it is just company shares. The living space ratio (per capita of course - his family is bigger), which approximates well actual consumption i.e. **actual rewards** is something 1:3 - 1:4. That is not really a big difference compared to the vast ""wealth"" or ""income"" difference. Of course his house is vastly more expensive because it is a top location, but location is not a well redistributable resource. 

Incidentally, *this is the problem of Eastern Europe*. I am from Hungary. We look rather equal by Gini index... but the consumption differences are huge, while wealth differences not. How is that even possible? Generally and by large it is possible by entrepreneurs being impatient idiots who care more about buying the last BMW than about actually funding the capital of their business, expanding their business, investing in it, and so on. So for example in EE you often see a transportation business using old, inefficient trucks, but the owner has a top-notch car. This is stupid. This is why we emigrate: ""Sorry I cannot raise your salary, because my son totally needs a single-family house built for him at the age of 25."" This is a similar problem, it is not only a moral problem of fucking over employees, it is also an efficiency problem of not investing into *talent retention*, so talent leaves and the business is screwed.
 
But Western Europe does not suffer from this problem - the ratio of business owners reinvesting vs. consuming their profits seems rather healthy. (America, esp. New York does suffer a bit from this kind of problem. Not so much as EE though.)",0,1359649274,null,0,1359653762,0,c86xphr,t3_17i8pa,t1_c86xphr,t1_c866kuo,null,1431140906,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,Delheru,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Precisely because all the non-local locals (i.e. the other migrants) tend to stick to their own circles, because most of them have rather rudimentary language skills

Are you sure you're not missing out on several ethnic migrant circles because their language skills are *not* rudimentary. In London for example there are significant numbers of migrants from Nordic countries, the subcontinent, Germany, USA, the colonies etc. All of these have the basic expat problem that they don't have their friends around them and aren't entirely familiar with the culture.

&gt; It is not that they are closed-minded, it is that for example we did not grow up on the same sitcoms so we do not understand the same jokes, and so on, it is just awkward, not as much fun.

This is a reasonable point. It's funny though how it implies a larger meta-culture that is centered on the US &amp; UK, but which is pervasive enough in Australia/NZ/South Africa and much of Northern Europe (and elites of Middle East, India and Russia I might add) that the experience is fairly seamless. I suppose if you're on the outside of that meta-culture, you'll have a harder time. I suspect the internet is making that culture spread further and further out, absorbing parts of the new entrants unique cultures. For example: Russian crazy is a major thing on the internet. 

(I also find it fascinating how many Mediterranean countries are actively avoiding this culture with low rates of participation on sites like reddit. I feel it's one of the reasons the Northern Europeans eye them suspiciously. Actually, it'd be curious to see how much cultural affinity could correlates with relative rates of reddit participation per country... it might make for a decent North/South proxy)

We can generally say that its supporters say it means ""free markets"", it's opponents use a long definition, but the important part of it is ""wage labor system"". 

I am not sure whether your ""capital accumulation"" definition is related to any of it. Even ""perfect communism"" would accumulate capital, the difference would be in its ownership. A society that does not accumulate capital simply does not progress, it is stagnating.

From the historical viewpoint, generally we had more free market inside states than within states in the 19th century,  interestingly, today we doing it the other way around: today it is OK to regulate every piece of the manufacturing process for safety, but today we somehow really hate tariffs.

As for your Korean example (and lately China): this is something I was wondering about how exactly it works, and came to the following conclusion: 

If a country would be isolated, then it would take many factors to have a good economy, and probably the very reason it would need free markets is that it is too complicated to get right by central control. 

But  today the Western world can get its innovation and financing sorted out on its own, and there is one thing missing withing its borders: cheap labor.

Therefore, any nation can make money that 1) is willing to cooperate with the West 2) offers cheap labor, even when it is done the most brutal dictatorial ways, without any kind of free markets whatsoever. 

Even Stalin could have offered the Gulag slave labor to the West and if it was accepted, the SU would have survived economically.

So this is a special situation. That in this specific situation when the brainwork is done by the West, theoretically any horrible dictatorship could offer cheap labor to the West and boast lots of economic progress in return. But not really a general rule.

France didnt want to intervene, the UN plan was an African intervention to support the Malian army. Unfortunately the Mali army was crap and the Africans were slow to respond. So France was forced to intervene in dangers as Islamists were just a few kilometres from Mali's capital. France is the only major country to have a large army force in the region, so they were the only ones who would have been able to pull it off (aswell as USA obviously, who can intervene wherever they want)

Their interventions, we could say, went in the direction of _accumulating national capital_ in various forms: businesses, infrastructure, knowledge.

Western interventions, being egalitarian, _decrease capital_ because the transfer from rich capital owners to poor consumers.

You could say that they were **supply-sider interventionists**.

In the West, the debate we have is free markets vs. egalitarianism, social democracy.

Even if Ha-Joon Chang is right in free markets not always being best, what he did not prove that the specifically Western kinds of non-free markets: social democratic egalitaranism, are better.

I would argue that protective measures (like tariffs) are more defensible than egalitarian redistribution - and this is precisely what Korea, Taiwan etc. did!

Note that there are also ""non-egalitarian interventionist"" governments in or near the West too. Putin's Russia is one famous example. In a different way the current government in my homeland, Hungary too, I wonder how it will turn out: they deviate from ""neoliberal orthodoxy"" - but not in a social democratic / egalitarian way!

Mali's government asked France to intervene. Islamists were a few kilometres away from taking the capital.. If France didnt intervent, Islamists would have taken over a whole country.. Thats a pretty big deal. Maybe France was not ""forced"" to intervene, but they had alot of big reasons to do so

true,_Dodecahedron_,null,null,"TL;DR: non credo che l'italia abbia bisogno di reazionari menzogneri filocattolici.

Contrariamente a quanto diranno alcuni, il problema di Monti non è il fatto che abbia aumentato in maniera indiscriminata le tasse. Cioé, non è solo quello (la necessità di avere delle entrate era evidente e giustificava), ma il modo in cui tutto questo è stato condotto mi ha lasciato perplesso ed è per me la ragione principale per cui non lo voterei mai. 
Alla fine quanto è avvenuto in Italia in questo anno e mezzo si può riassumere con: abbiamo un problema e una soluzione al problema che ne creerà di nuovi. Si sapeva benissimo che le manovre proposte erano molto probabilmente recessive (così è stato) ma il non aver saputo (o l'aver volutamente ignorato) la possibilità di controbilanciare la questione sociale, la caduta degli stipendi e il non essere stato in grado di imporre liberalizzazioni serie ha fatto si che Monti, ai miei occhi, perdesse sempre più di credibilità. Ma si può dire che ""va bene"", che non aveva una maggioranza, che c'erano i partiti a devastare la sua azione. E allora che persona è Monti? In questo anno ne ha sparate a migliaia di frasi da capitalista reazionario. Sulla sanità, sul sistema pensionistico, scuola e lavoro, cose ignobili e degne di un estremista, altro che ""moderato"". Monti di moderato ha ben poco sotto questo punto di vista. 
E no, non sono un lòlcomplottista hurr durr minkiazzio-le-bbankke, ma ditemi come definire uno che definisce ""conservatori"" gli insegnanti che non vogliono lavorare GRATIS sei ore in più (mentendo sul fatto che erano solo due da Fazio). O anche, uno che afferma che il lavoro fisso è noioso e c'è bisogno di mobilità come in Europa (dimenticandosi però che nei paesi europei sussistono condizioni ben diverse da quelle italiane, ma si sa, l'Europa è diventata un cesto in cui infilarci di tutto, l'equivalente della Sostanza Reticolare della gestione dello stato). Monti è drogato di Europa, in tutti i sensi, ma solo per determinati aspetti; gli altri li tralascia volutamente.
Ma passiamo al concreto: le sue riforme? Beh, oltre al danno al welfare sociale, ad una riforma del sistema pensionistico e del lavoro che hanno creato il buco gigante degli esodati, alle liberazioni rimandate ai primi gné gné dei vendicaramelle (""farmacisti""), a dei nuovi contratti di lavoro che sono una mera presa in giro, alla ""sospensione"" dell'art.18 che c'è da dire? Nulla. Doveva sistemare dei conti, ha aumentato determinate imposte e ha fatto un po' di cassa.
Sulla coalizione: Monti è l'imene rifatto della vecchia DC. L'Italia non ha bisogno di ulteriori ingerenze ecclesiastiche, già ben chiare sulle sue parole sulle coppie di fatto e altri temi che pungono il culo alle alte sfere (e non menziono l'elettorato cattolico, che è più una chimera o una sparuta minoranza al giorno d'oggi). Chi lo sostiene? Il buon vecchio Casini, presente da ere geologiche e che mira a rompere i coglioni con il suo 4% fisso. Montezemolo, ma che idee ha? Boh. Fini, anche lui li da una vita e che non ha mai concluso nulla se non l'essere il cofirmatario di una delle più schifose leggi sull'immigrazione. La società civile? Banchieri, economisti e qualche sportivo dalle dubbie capacità politiche.

- The church will usually be chosen by the family due to significance and/or proximity. Eulogies will be made during the service.

- The funeral home will provide transport and the installation of an eventual tombstone if a new plot is used (but you can just make a simple flat-ground tomb, with a wood cross).

- The undertaker will do the digging work prior to the ceremony and lower the casket.

Wether that be through capitalism, socialism, something totally new or anything in between seems completely irrelevant.


It is not *completely* irrelevant, but you have a point. My grandfather, who absolutely *hated* the social democrats, used to say that as well. I hate them, but at least they are pragmatic (fun fact, my grandmother voted for the social democrats). For me it is just normal that you abandon your policies if they are stupid, but perhaps that is a Nordic way of looking at it.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; It is not that we are really doing anything odd and innovative, it is just that it seems to work a tad more in the Nordic countries.

I think you guys really are quite innovative, it's not about being left or right, but a different way of framing the political debate. My impression is that you are much more hard-headed about competitiveness, i.e. that if a person is doing a job which has an export value of EUR 35,000, they can only be paid EUR 50,000 for an intermediate period, until the business collapses. Britain is supposed to be liberal, but we really don't like the logic of that idea at all, and it is considered right wing rhetoric. 

On the other hand, you seem to have a much more interventionist approach towards skilling people up to become competitive. In Britain the unemployed get basically no help at all, not even a proper careers or advisory service. We don't realize that it costs £10,000 a year to support someone out of work, but only something about £7,000 extra to put them through education or training. After they're trained, they'll also probably end up paying back taxes. In other words, it's much cheaper and far more humane to make an unemployed person more productive, on a fully funded year's training course, than have them out of work for two years. 

So right wing on competitiveness, left wing on increased spending for education and training. And I think this policy will become increasingly successful as technology speeds up, and the labour market becomes more and more unstable. For instance, if driverless cars come about, there will be hundreds of thousands of people looking for new jobs. You guys will cut your losses, make your economy more efficient, and use the money to put in the investment to train them up for something else; our left wingers will hang on to the jobs till the bitter end, then our right wingers will cast the workers on the scrap heap, and call them scroungers.

**GERMANY**

http://german.about.com/library/blname_reg.htm

&gt; ""Germans are used to being regulated in many areas of daily life that Americans might find rather repressive. Want to name your baby? Better pick a name that the local Standesamt (office of vital statistics) agrees with. If they don't agree to register the name you picked, you have to appeal the decision. By German law, a child's name has to meet two conditions: (1) it must reflect the sex of the child, and (2) it must not endanger the 'well-being of the child.' A German couple who wanted to honor their favorite actress, Whoopi Goldberg, by naming their child Whoopi had their application rejected because, among other thing, the name resembles the English expression 'making whoopee.' Another daughter from a mixed Chinese-German marriage was to receive the name Fae-Schüe. The Standesamt did not approve the name until it had first checked with the Chinese embassy to verify that the name was indeed a common Chinese name meaning 'snowflake.'

&gt; As a result of this kind of control, most Germans end up with rather conventional first names such as Julia, Julian, Phillip, Maria, Maximilian, Lisa, or Christian..."" (THE GERMAN WAY, McGraw-Hill, pp. 96-97.

&gt; People expecting children can choose a pre-approved name from a government list of 7,000 mostly West European and English names - 3,000 for boys, 4,000 for girls. A few ethnic names, like Ali and Hassan, have recently been added.

&gt; But those wishing to deviate from the official list must seek permission at their local parish church, where all newborns' names are registered. A request for an unapproved name triggers a review at Copenhagen University's Names Investigation Department and at the Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs, which has the ultimate authority. The law applies only if one of the parents is Danish.

&gt; Many parents do not realize how difficult it can be to get a name approved by the government. About 1,100 names are reviewed every year, and 15 percent to 20 percent are rejected, mostly for odd spellings.

On the other hand, cheese isn't a bad idea. As an expat, it's one of the things I miss most. Someone suggested Maroilles; I'm from that very area and I'd say it's a great idea. To give you a bit of background, it's one of the smelliest cheeses in France (and that's saying something, even though the taste is fairly mild), so famous that it's the subject of jokes on the people from that area (le Nord), who are rumoured to dip it on coffee in the morning. 

Now, I don't have any clue about the availability of Freedom Cheese in the US, and Maroilles is pretty specific; but I think that, as an unexpected gift, it would certainly remind him of home because of its strong image and association with the region.

Otherwise, Reblochon or raclette are always welcome in wintertime. 

Alternatively, you could try to get you hands on *saucisson*, a dried sausage most commonly from southern France but enjoyed everywhere.  Bonus point if its made from venison, like boar.

I might add that they are married to non Gothenburg people who was shocked, and said ""this is wrong"". My oldest cousin, grudgingly admitted, that she ""might have gotten use to a few things"". Fun fact- she is a lawyer. 

Stockholm is certainly not better, but in the last 20 years, Stockholm has been foght over - bitterly, at every election. There is no room for errors in Stockholm.  They do not have the time to become corrupt, and even if they do, in four years, they will here about it, and  everyone will know. 

Göteborgs problems is that you have let the power stay with one man for far to long, and it shows. He, had far to much power, and you know it. I am pretty sure it is the same in Danderyd, Täby, Luleå etc, as well, but it doesn' impact as many people.

As it is now, the current conflict is not about the independence of the northern state of Azawad as a Touareg territory - it has escalated to an effort to push radical Islamic armed groups out of what they thought was an opportunity to take over Mali.

But you're not the only ones, we have our own share of stupidity.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_name#Forenames

&gt; In Germany, the chosen name must be approved by the local Standesamt (Office of Vital Statistics). The name must indicate the gender of the child and not negatively affect the well being of the child. Last names or the names of objects and products are not acceptable. For example, ""Matti"" was rejected for a boy's name because it did not indicate gender.

But nothing indicates gender. It is our perception that gives meaning and indicates gender. Names did not drop from the sky.",0,1359676546,null,0,1359676824,0,c876ztz,t3_17niyk,t1_c876ztz,t1_c87615i,null,1431145399,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3
