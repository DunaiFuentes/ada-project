You only pay to the university what used to be the 218.61€ per semester.

They are re-evaluated every year or so, so by the time you start, they might be in the ballpark of ~250€. As noted in your weblink, this includes a ticket which can be used on almost all kinds of trains within the Bundesland (state) of [NRW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Rhine-Westphalia) except the super-fast ones.

La mia storia inizia a fine 2011 quando cambiando abitazione termino il mio contratto con Fastweb. Mi informo e scopro che bisogna riconsegnare modem etc che avevo in comodato d'uso. (Nota personale: trattandosi di roba di 6 anni prima, probabilmente spendono più a smaltirli che altro, e gli converrebbe che scomparissero nel nulla).

Comunque dopo aver tentato inutilmente di riconsegnarlo in un paio di negozi presi da una lista sul loro sito, mi informo per telefono e scopro che posso spedirlo, spendo 12€ di pacco e via, una preoccupazione in meno. Lo spedisco prima della scadenza indicata e fortunatamente, avendo letto strane storie online, per sicurezza bado bene di conservare la ricevuta di spedizione.


Fastforward qualche mese dopo, verso marzo 2012 mi arriva la prima telefonata (avevano il mio numero di cellulare dal contratto Fastweb, mentre ero ovviamente irraggiungibile al vecchio indirizzo, e non compaio negli elenchi con il nuovo) dalla Ge.Ri. recupero crediti: gli devo 250€ entro qualche settimana e mi invitano a passare sul loro sito internet a pagare.

Io consapevole del fatto che si trattasse della mancata riconsegna (mai avvenuta secondo loro) delle apparecchiature, decido semplicemente di ignorarli: appena sento recupero crediti, riaggancio. D'altronde se un tizio ti telefona e ti chiede di versargli soldi su un conto tu glieli dai? Senza un foglio che giustificasse la richiesta, di sicuro non avrei scucito un centesimo.

Da subito ho pensato - e continuo a farlo - che le loro siano solo tattiche di pressione psicologica: ci provano, tanto spendono poco o nulla, se uno si spaura (o si scoccia) paga, altrimenti non andranno mai fino in fondo per cifre del genere. Ma qui le cose si fanno interessanti...


A un certo punto ricevo una telefonata dall'*""ufficio postale""* della mia città, che mi fa sapere della presenza di una raccomandata - sulla quale era indicato il mio numero di telefono - indirizzata all'indirizzo precedente e quindi rimbalzata, e mi chiede il mio nuovo indirizzo. Io aspettandomi effettivamente una richiesta cartacea da parte della società recupero crediti gli fornisco l'indirizzo, un po' sorpreso della cosa.

Solo quando la settimana dopo mi arriva una lettera, e non una raccomandata, datata un paio di giorni dopo la telefonata, con peraltro l'indirizzo leggermente sbagliato (blabla*rs*o anziché blabla*ss*o) capisco che si è trattato della stessa società di recupero crediti che mi ha **truffato** al telefono per avere il mio indirizzo attuale! 
Robe da pazzi ma per aggiungere danno alla beffa, sulla busta è ben presente il logo e la dicitura della società di recupero crediti e questa è una **violazione della privacy** perché tutte queste comunicazioni dovrebbero essere in busta anonima per evitare che tutti sappiano che hai ""problemi"" di debiti.

Ma passiamo al contenuto della busta: la classica minaccia a pagare entro tot giorni dalla ricezione altrimenti passeranno a vie legali. Vabé lasciamo perdere la validità legale di questa scadenza, non essendo nemmeno una raccomandata - perché gli costerebbe troppo - ma del motivo del mio debito ancora nemmeno l'ombra.

Seguono ulteriori telefonate, una volta provo anche a spiegargli che mi chiedono dei soldi che non gli devo perché il loro maledetto modem gliel'ho spedito, alché pretendono di sapere che non è così e che si tratta di ""fatture insolute"" (come se la parola fattura corrispondesse a bolletta) e addirittura quasi mi insultano perché, telefonandomi un giorno a caso a ora di pranzo, io non ho con me il loro codice ""cliente""... Insomma fanno di tutto per intimorirmi, oppure confutare la mia posizione senza prova alcuna in un puro esercizio di sofismo.

Nel mentre io per scrupolo richiedo a Fastweb una copia della fantomatica fattura, che mi conferma che l'unico addebito *presunto* riguarda la mancata riconsegna, e anzi c'è un'altra fattura, un **credito** di una decina di euro per acconti/conguagli/boh :D


Comunque passa il tempo - un paio di mesi di avanti e indietro - ed io me la rido alle loro nuove minacce via posta (stavolta da parte del loro avvocato, e siamo arrivati intorno ai 300€, poi 400€ scaduti i termini) in attesa che si stanchino o che agiscano veramente per vie legali, dove potrò dimostrare facilmente l'inesistenza del debito. Alla fine per accontentare mio padre che si preoccupava che venissi bollato come ""cattivo creditore"" telefono a Fastweb, spiego la storia e come richiesto mando via fax la famosa ricevuta della spedizione, richiedendo che comunicassero tempestivamente la risoluzione della faccenda alla Ge.Ri. Addirittura dicono che mi manderanno il conguaglio che mi spettava (mai visto, ma vabé diciamo che si è perso nella posta..).

Ciliegina sulla torta: qualche settimana dopo sono ad Amsterdam - per lavoro non pensate male :P - e chi mi telefona? Ma miss *pezzo grosso* del recupero crediti ovviamente, che mi propone un vantaggiosissimo patteggiamento last minute, 300 e qualcosa € anziché proseguire per vie legali.. qui mi giravano proprio le palle perché stavo anche pagando per rispondere al telefono a questi stronzi, gli spiego che ho risolto tutto direttamente con Fastweb, alché la tizia si inalbera e mi chiede con chi abbia parlato (ma con Clooney ovviamente!) e di tutta risposta le chiedo piuttosto come avessero loro ottenuto il mio nuovo indirizzo, perché avessero sostenuto che si trattassero di bollette arretrate etc.. insomma le faccio notare quanto la sua compagnia fosse *shady*.

Di tutta risposta lei mi fa: ""ma come si permette, guardi che la telefonata è registrata e potrà essere utilizzata in sede legale"". Le faccio notare che se veramente è stata registrata senza richiedere il mio consenso quella che dovrà spiegarsi in sede legale è lei e la mando a quel paese riattaccando.

What is there is the half-annual enrollment-fee which is around 220-250€, so you basically have to subtract the 480\*2 from your calculation, but add 30\*2=60 or so as a buffer. So you can subtract roughly 900€ per semester =&gt;1800 per year.

659 € per month for living expenses alone seems really high imho. For comparison, people on unemployment/welfare get up to 382 € per month, and you can live *relatively* comfortably with that (granted, you cannot afford fancy stuff) I would estimate maybe 500€ for living expenses. You'd spend roughly 150\*12=1800€ less than your calculations per year.

Based on those calculations, you can likely get by with 3600€ less per year than what you calculated, landing you at around 10k per year. Unless I miscalculated something. It's 2 AM here. You might want to triple-check.

I don't know about the living costs in Dortmund, but those seem about right. Maybe someone else can chime in about that. 

Also, I forgot to mention, the ticket should include public transport at least within city limits, and German public transportation is great, so you don't have to worry about needing a car.

A **violent attack** is fairly self explanatory. When someone is attacked, violently. These tend to be crimes in most places.

""**Hate crime**"" has a couple of different definitions, but the relevant one here is probably [this one](http://www.report-it.org.uk/what_is_hate_crime) - a crime ""targeted at a person because of hostility or prejudice towards"" that person's perceived characteristics/identity. For the most part this is an issue for the police and CPS; so this story means Manchester police will be expanding the relevant ""characteristics"" beyond the list in the above link to various subculture identities. This is an extra box for the police to tick when filling out the paperwork, and means the CPS - when prosecuting (or deciding to) - will consider this extra ""hostility"" as a relevant factor. It may also be relevant at sentencing, if an individual is convicted (the ""hostility"" being an aggravating factor, which may increase a sentence).

There are a couple of statutory ""hate crime"" things; there are [specific offences](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/37/part/II/crossheading/raciallyaggravated-offences-england-and-wales) for ""racially or religiously aggravated"" assault, criminal damage, harassment or various public order offences. These tend to increase the maximum sentence available under the substantive offences. There are also sentencing rules that say a court *must* take [racial or religious stuff](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/145) (in the crimes above) and [sexual orientation or disability stuff](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/146) (in any crime) as aggravating factors.

Not all violent attacks are hate crimes, and not all hate crimes have to be violent attacks.


As for why ""hate crimes"" receive extra attention, there is a fairly neat (if wordy) justification given by Baroness Hale in a [2007 case](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/8.html):

&gt; The mischiefs attacked by the aggravated versions of these offences are racism and xenophobia [this case was about racial stuff, not any of the other options]. Their essence is the denial of equal respect and dignity to people who are seen as ""other"". This is more deeply hurtful, damaging and disrespectful to the victims than the simple versions of these offences. It is also more damaging to the community as a whole, by denying acceptance to members of certain groups not for their own sake but for the sake of something they can do nothing about.

La part de la sécurité sociale dans la dette totale est bien moindre que celle de l'Etat:
http://www.cndp.fr/stat-apprendre/comptes/etat/dette/dette_raisons2t.htm

Ainsi le total de la dette de la sécu en 2008 (120 milliards) est moindre que le montant de l'augmentation de la dette de l'Etat entre 2008 et 2009.
Ainsi, la totalité de la dette des collectivités locales ET de la sécu en 2011 (370 milliards) est inférieur à l'augmentation de la dette de l'Etat entre 2007 et 2011 (400 milliards).

La question est donc, pourquoi une telle dette de la part de l'Etat?
Un bon article pour montrer l'arnaque et le double standard (dans les pays du sud on parle de service de la dette - remboursement intérêts et capital - alors qu'au nord on ne parle que de la charge de la dette - remboursement des seuls intérêts). On occulte les chiffres pour faire oublier que le montant servi en intérêts est ridiculement élevé et n'est que de l'escroquerie financière qu'un bon coup de guillotine devra un jour régler.

*1995-2011, le capital emprunté a déjà été remboursé 3 fois et il en reste encore 4,6 fois plus à rembourser !*

*En 1995, le stock de la dette publique s’élevait au 31 décembre à 431 Mds d’€. Fin 2011, le total cumulé des intérêts servis et des capitaux remboursés s’élèvera lui, à 2 013Mds d’€, soit 4,6 fois plus qu’en 1995.
Dans le même temps, la dette aura été élevée à 1 333 Mds d’€, soit plus de 3 fois le montant de 1995.
Les intérêts payés (658Mds d’€) représenteront plus de 2 fois le total des dépenses du budget général (285,7Mds d’.€ pour 2011).*

We have a ridiculously large number of crimes prevented by people carrying concealed that no one ever mentions. I believe it is an FBI statistic, though I have never had to look it up myself.

The logic behind a lot of it is familiarity with firearms gives you a respect for their use. I can attest to this. I have broken a lot of the gun-fear a lot of my liberal friends have -- they may not like firearms, but now they aren't big black scary things.

With an respect of a weapon comes a reluctance to use it. See the atom bomb for this logic on a grand scale. 

Naturally, you don't want everyone to have an atom bomb/gun, because that's how shit blows up. So enter gun control.

Basically, as a pro-gun liberal, I want to see easy-access of firearms to all citizens to protect themselves against the crazed minority that procure illegal weapons and use them to bully others. We even have state-chapters of pro-gun homosexual rights activists who advocate homosexuals to conceal carry for their own defense -- a proven deterrent to hate crimes. I believe they are called the Pink Pistols.

The problem is, our NRA lobbies and such don't want guns to be registered or any data to be collected that could be used as ammo, good or bad. So we have limited sources and anecdotal evidence firing all over the place on policy debate. It's kind of ridiculous.

What lots of people (particularly the anti-gun control crowd) fail to realize is that the *vast* majority of gun violence in the U.S. is gang and drug war related. It's minority on minority crime. People opting for concealed carry are very unlikely to ever be exposed to that violence.

It's all part of the plan of the NRA and the gun manufacturers who pull their strings to get people to buy up weapons and ammunition. There's actually a shortage right now because of all the people panic buying.

Anyone with any common sense can look at a chart correlating gun ownership and murder rates and see that the U.S. is so much worse off compared to Europe that it's ridiculous.

true,clearskiez,null,null,"Because I believe EU does better job at protecting interests of big companies than protecting interests of its citizens. And that is because of current EU political structure, politicians feel very little (if any) consequences of their decisions on the people, and the people are almost completely powerless to influence politicians.

Example: GM foods were forbidden in most of the EU states, until Brussel got enough power with Lisbon treaty, and in few months gave green light for GMO for whole Europe - even though more than 90% of Germans and 85% of French people were against it. With Lisbon treaty also came Citizens' Iniciative, possibility to change EU laws if one million signatures were collected for a petition. So an anti-GMO petition was created, and it quickly collected more than one million votes. [But EU decided to ignore it, and it has been doing so since 2010](http://euobserver.com/environment/31474), showing that politicians in EU don't have to fear the people and can simply ignore they wishes.

I also strongly disagree with monetary policy in EU and how the money is created (only as a debt to private banks - EU should be able to print its own money without owning any private bank anything). Private banks have way too much power in EU and over its legislators. [European Stability Mechanism is one of the proofs of that](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZZMXNr95Zs). How they replaced Greek PM in a week, after he just suggested to hold referendum if people would like to be more in debt to private banks in exchange for austerity measures, is another example; how EU is treating protesters in Greece, Spain, Cyprus is another; and there are more.

I don't like how EU pushed referendum for Lisbon treaty ('you will vote for it until you vote yes'). After getting 'no' three times in a row, no-one is asking Irish if they still agree with ratifying it.


**But** on the other hand, I think that it is wonderful that people of the Europe want to put differences aside and unite together, I just don't think that EU, as it is currently envisioned, is good for the people living inside it. And I would completely support some different political union, where politicians are more responsible to the people, and where banks don't have so much power, and where the state can create its own money.

Put it onto a slice of bread and cover it with freedom cheese (""Scheiblettenkäse""). Put into oven until cheese is melted, the cheese takes most of the hotness away, enabling you to enjoy the fruity/citrus-y taste.

You can use both to mean room, just keep in mind that raum has other uses in other words. Der Arbeitsraum can mean Arbeitszimmer, but it can also mean a place for working, or space in which to work, etc. as with Wohnraum, Konferenzraum, etc.

We sometimes use ""space"" in the same way in English. ""This is a great meeting space"" can in certain contexts be used to refer to a room, rather than just an area. I think raum is more closely tied to Zimmer in german though than space is to room in English.

Would wait for a native speaker to clarify about how relative usages, but Raum meaning an enclosed part of a building is listed as the first definition on duden, so I would assume that it's more than fine to use it that way.

So, for it to be democratic, and actually work in the long run (since the Eurozone can be built upon breaking treaties) the Maastrich treaty will have to be re-negotiated and voted about in the individual member states. 

I personally do not think any northern country will vote yes, but of course I might be wrong.

*Sir Humphrey Appleby:* Minister, Britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last 500 years: to create a disunited Europe. In that cause we have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. Divide and rule, you see. Why should we change now when it’s worked so well?

*James Hacker:* That’s all ancient history, surely.

*Sir Humphrey Appleby:* Yes, and current policy. We had to break the whole thing up, so we had to get inside. We tried to break it up from the outside, but that wouldn’t work. Now that we’re inside we can make a complete pig’s breakfast of the whole thing: set the Germans against the French, the French against the Italians, the Italians against the Dutch. The Foreign Office is terribly pleased, it’s just like old times.

*James Hacker:* But if that’s true, why is the foreign office pushing for higher membership?

*Sir Humphrey Appleby:* I’d have thought that was obvious. The more members an organization has, the more arguments it can stir up. The more futile and impotent it becomes.

*James Hacker:* What appalling cynicism.

*Sir Humphrey Appleby:* We call it diplomacy, Minister.

The viewpoint of those people who agree with some amount of segregation is hardly presented, when it is presented, it is characterizing them with the worst people, skinheads, neo-Nazis, and even when the view of the average person is presented it is called ""prejudice"", linked with murder etc. 

And this attitude is always typical of reportage when racial, ethnic tensions, especially with the Roma are reported anywhere in the western world. 

While journalists can present such tensions in third-world places like tribal wars in Africa or Muslim-Buddhist clashes in Sri Lanka in an objective way, here the Roma are always shown as purely victims, and the average white person as simply stupid, hateful, prejudicial etc.

This is very much one sided. What is missing is the everyday experiences of average people, a presentation of the sources of their prejudices (often ""postjudices""), a view that there is serious suffering going on on the ""white"" side as well, that is not simply privileged rich folks sailing easy and trying to oppress others for fun but often desperately poor villagers who just want a basic sense of security for their meagre property and their persons.

I mean, the point is not that these people are right, but that there are two sides to every story, and this side is hardly presented at all.

Even if you find it hard to empathize with the average antiroma white poor guy, there is another reason to present this side: whenever people feel their grievances are not represetented, they get extremist.  They get violent. Even if you think they deserve no voice because they are better off than the Roma, you must give them a voice because they are _dangerous_.

This I think is a problem both in Eastern European and Western European media, regarding any kind of ethic or racial tension, anti-immigration, anti-Muslim, anti-Roma, that the mainstream takes this ""they are fascists, yell them down, no debate with them"" attitude.

But when the ""little guy"" who has some actual problems, crime, shittier neighborhood, whatever, feels that nobody listens to his problems, he gets angry, hateful, and violent, so this will just result in more and more of that stuff like that shooter in Norway or skinhead bands beating people of color up.

The salary caps have just been introduced. If Switzerlands level goes beyond what the EU mandates then everything is fine, otherwise they will have to adjust that eventually. It's the good old principal - agent relationship. 

Your idea that the Swiss approach is somewhat better displays a rather naive view of the problem. In theory shareholders were always able to block anything proposed by the management. The simply fact is just that shares of bigger companies are mostly held by institutional investors. Which are run by managers themselves. Who have proven to be most sympathetic to demands of increased pay. The idea that under the Swiss proposal the lonesome shareholder (or even a bunch of them) is somehow able to block pay increases is ludicrous. 

I don't even understand where you are trying to get with your watch example. This is one product where there are probably close to none EU regulations, except the mandated use of ISO threads and the like. Standards in the context of EU regulations are more about emission and labor standards while producing something, sizes, quality standards, documentation, packaging, etc. Switzerland had and has to implement these standards in full. They are not going to refit their production lines just because they get the occasional order from China.

true,chilbrain,EURO,European Union,"I don't think that the right to be forgotten is important enough to back out of a europe-wide data protection framework, which is a very good thing.

However, I do think that the right to be forgotten is misguided. It is based on an old-fashioned distinction between data subject and data processor. However, in social networks, a user is usually not just a data subject, but a data processor as well. For the right to be forgotten to be effective, a social network would have to delete not only the content the user added to facebook themselves, but also the content that other users added about them.

This could not only disrupt the use of a social network by people connected to the person who is making use of their right to be forgotten, it could actually limit their freedom of expression. Also, if we legally oblige social networks to filter the content their users produce, especially on such intransparent grounds, we open the door for them to filter any content as they see fit.

Say you have a political campaign on facebook. facebook removes it and claims they had to do so because of someone's right to be forgotten. They can't show you the evidence and they can't show you who the person was who wanted to be forgotten, because that would defeat the purpose of their request to be forgotten. In other words, you social networks could filter content as they see fit and have the law on their side.

Furthermore, the enforcement of the right to be forgotten would be extremely difficult, as people on social networks are so interconnected. Even honest attempts to delete all the relevant information would regularly fail. Therefore, it is giving especially young people a false sense of security that their actions online can later be easily deleted, when this is not the reality we live in. It would be much more useful to teach children and youths that everything they do online under their real name will potentially be public and associated with them forever and that they should use direct means of (online) communication, pseudonyms and encryption for private stuff.

Bulgarians, Serbs and Greeks are orthodox Christians and Croatians are Catholics. The different religions have made so many conflicts in the area. Being in Albania you've probably been in the second(after Turkey) most hated country on the Balkans.

But wait...there is more. Territorial disputes are many and' it's not just the former Yugoslav republics. For example there is the Bulgaria-Macedonia which is pretty big. Some countries write different histories and try to take credit for things that other countries did(Yes Macedonia I'm looking at you).

It's not just that. Even Serbs and Bulgarians, who seem like the closest brothers(same religion, very close language) hate each other in massive numbers(which is a mystery to me).

Almost everyone hates the Turks(which is far from being a surprise seeing what they did)

true,BobLeeJagger,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Please answer me: If the EU really is holding member countries back, how is it Germany out-exports any other European country - including Switzerland?

I've not said that the EU is holding member countries back. I'm saying that a looser relationship (IMO) would be better for the time being - the evidence is the mess you're seeing in the EU at the moment. Do you think Germany would be better off if it didn't have to hand out huge swathes of cash to the southern countries?

&gt;Your idea that the Swiss approach is somewhat better displays a rather naive view of the problem.

Cool, but before you were saying that they had to follow the EU mandated salary cap, which was wrong. Your opinion of what is better isn't important because I'm guessing you're not an expert in the field. That's a philosophical discussion for another time, my original point (that the Swiss are exempt from EU financial regulation) still stands. 

The watch example was to highlight your absurd observation about the danger of ""half a dozen standards for their varying customers?"". I showed you the *exact* same Swiss watch being sold in two markets - do you seriously think the Omega factory retooled for that? No, of course not. Do you think they retool for china? No, of course not. Care to name an example where of Swiss good where the factory would have to be retooled for selling to another market? That's what you said happens - I'm saying it doesn't and it's not got anything to do with EU membership. 

You mentioned labor standards and you're wrong - In 2003 EU passed a directive saying workers should not do more than 48 hours per week, that's not the case in Switzerland (45 hours for Industrial and 50 for others).

First of all, I am British and work in Information Security. Second of all, please note that the EU's very own ENISA disagrees with many of the proposals in this law....

While it sounds like the type of law we ought to strive for and support, our objection is not one purely of ideology. Although I do suspect the influence of lobby groups somewhat.

Instead, our objection is one of practicality. Much like the cookie law, which is horrendously pointless and annoying, this law is unenforceable and creates all sorts of logistical and compliance issues for services operating within the EU. Greylings concern that it creates 'unrealistic expectations' here is completely justified.

Of course. This doesn't change the fact that the ideal itself is a good one. If only it were more... possible. I don't think we should be outright opposing it given our stance. Instead we should be demonstrating its flaws and assisting in writing a draft which will achieve as much of the objective as possible while still being practical.

-------------

&gt;Can you explain why this is impossible?

Glad you asked. I, working in IT, and Security specifically consider myself to be somewhat knowledgeable on such a proposal. So let me give you a scenario.

Bob, 14, on a drunken night out takes some photos of himself which he publishes online. The WayBackMachine, some of this friends, Google cache, etc all take copies. Furthermore due to Bob's inherent popularity several people take pictures with a handheld camera of the computer screen containing the photo's online. The story even reaches print media. Bob, now wants a paper round. However the owner of the corner shop, researching Bob online decides that this is not the type of employee he wants. Bob, invokes this right to be forgotten. He manages to remove the picture from social networking sites where he is the user concerned. But what of other people who have copied the photo. What of his Wikipedia page which even states the conviction he received? What of the newspapers littering bus seats? What of all the cache systems where he has no idea the photo is stored?

Worse still. Bob is not the only one in the photo. Andrew is in it too. He doesn't want to be forgotten and actively opposes take down.

My views are shared with the European Network and Information Security Agency;
https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/the-right-to-be-forgotten/

&gt; the right to be forgotten is basically do not track

Not quite. The law is much more comprehensive than that.

&gt; This is absolutely moronic; the same logic could be applied to almost any issue of Internet law - it's always hard to know whether data has been replicated, modified or deleted. And yet they have absolutely no problem pushing for draconian but equally difficult to enforce laws when they benefit corporations.

I see your point, but two wrongs don't make a right. I probably agree with you, however, especially given the ISP storage consideration - something I also disagree with on the basis of it being nearly impossible.

You are quite correct in the context of a recent proposal to track people online - specifically the origin and destination of communications with 'plugins' for various services. It is peculiar that our Government can propose with one hand and object with another.

However, it is worth noting that this law covers rights of the individual over their own data. Rather than the right to be monitored. Although they sound similar they are in fact quite different.

Danube is an exception because its phonology makes it possible to have entered Romanian in ancient times, even though its reconstructed form, *Donaris is quite different from the Latin Danubius.

Timiș might show an Albanian/Dacian feature of b/m change, so it's possible that it was borrowed in Romanian directly from the Dacians.

This process is by no means complete, this one just happens to be one of the next steps. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and predict that if the UK opts out of this one, Facebook will move its European HQ to the UK. 

Another factor is consumers. I know that no matter where in the EU I buy something, I'll have similar rights in terms of warranty, the Recycling Directive is in force, and so on. I don't want to have to remember that I'll have less privacy rights when I use a website in the UK, a shorter warranty in country X, or otherwise lesser consumer rights in country Y.  
For businesses, it's similar. I could make an online shop that uses a payment processor from another EU member, and be confident that it will adhere to privacy rights of my customers in third member states, without having to consult a lawyer. If I ran a factory, I wouldn't have to worry about competitors with unrestricted access to my market in another EU country that has opted out of some environmental protection policy.

&gt; The mischiefs attacked by the aggravated versions of these offences are racism and xenophobia

She thinks racism and xenophobia are bad, so she wants to do something about them.

&gt; Their essence is the denial of equal respect and dignity to people who are seen as ""other"".

They are bad because they involve separating out ""other"" people, and treating them worse, due to some characteristic that they may have no control over, and doesn't justify that treatment.

&gt; This is more deeply hurtful, damaging and disrespectful to the victims than the simple versions of these offences.

It is (slightly) worse to be attacked for who you are than for what you have done (e.g. being in the wrong part of town, or provoking an attack through your actions) as it tells you that there is something wrong with who you are, that you are excluded from the relevant society etc.

&gt; It is also more damaging to the community as a whole, by denying acceptance to members of certain groups not for their own sake but for the sake of something they can do nothing about.

It's bad for communities because it communities are stronger when they are accepting/welcoming of others, diverse, open etc.. Tolerating racism and xenophobia go against this by excluding certain people, again not because of something they have done (which might justify it) but because of who they are.

Dein Textverständnis ist auch nicht das beste. Er kritisiert nicht empirische Studien an sich sondern kurze Auftragsstudien die keine wirklichen neuen Einsichten bringen. Davon gibt es genug. Und gute Statistik und Studiendesign ist eine Kunst bzw. Wissenschaft. 

Zudem ist seine Kritik an der Ausbildung durchaus berechtigt.. toller English klingender Name des Studiengangs, eine Mixtur aus Fächern die meist unter Abitur-Niveau gelehrt wird und durch die Fülle der Veranstaltungen ist das Niveau meist ziemlich mies. Das Geisteswissenschaften so nicht wirklich funktionieren können ist doch berechtigte Kritik. 

Dass Naturwissenschaften völlig anders funktionieren und hier Aufsätze eine viel größere Rolle spielen ist auch völlig klar. 

Zudem sehe ich an meiner Universität den Großteil der Mitarbeiter und Professoren nicht Forschen sondern eben Anträge schreiben, In Meetings sitzen und Firmen bezirzen doch bitte etwas Geld für ein Projekt bereit zu stellen. Die Wissenschaft spielt dann keine größere Rolle mehr.

This is from a few days ago, as it was announced that Game of Thrones broke a new torrent record:

&gt;In a recent interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, ""Game of Thrones"" co-creator David Benioff speculated about all the special effects he could buy if those who illegally pirated the show were paying 99 cents or so per download.
&gt;
&gt;""You do kind of think, God, if we just had a little bit of that, we could have had that extra scene with the dragons,"" he said.
&gt;
&gt;Fans who might be willing to cough up that 99 cents for a pay-per-episode purchase of the new season don't have any opportunity to do so. New ""Game of Thrones"" episodes are available only to HBO subscribers, through its cable channel and its HBO Go on-demand app. Viewers outside the U.S. typically have to wait a week or more for new episodes to reach their local markets.

&gt;We call you Nazis because everything you do, you have to be in control and in power.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;That's why there's also the term ""Cleaning Nazi"" or something something Nazi whenever it is about domination and control.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;When we say Nazi we actually mean German - not because of the Nazi party and what Hitler did, but because the modern meaning of a Nazi perfectly describes the stereotypical view of a German - standardized, meticulos, always wanting to be in control and in power of everything.
&gt;All the Germans that I've met in real-life have also proven to be Nazis (not racist, man-hating, Aryan loving kind of way) but power-hungry, control freaks that wanted it their way or the highway.

Feelings toward colonies are really mitigated. On the one hand you have self-loathing people who see it as a shame and nothing more, on the other hand some of us want to consider the help we gave them to start industrialization.  
Colonialism can be roughly separated in two periods: we first colonized a large chunk of north america from the 16th century to the late 18th, and then participated in the scramble for africa and colonized Vietnam/Laos/Cambodia and a small part of China.  
There's no hard feelings about the first colonization anymore I feel. France has left a cultural trace on places like Louisiana and Maine but people don't really care about that either way. The obvious exception is Québec, whom we often refer to as our cousins and whose independance seem to be widely supported over here, despite the position of our last presidents on the matter. They don't seem to like us very much though, in spite of our bonds our cultures really have drifted and we are very different in some aspects.  
The colonization of africa and southeast asia is a different matter, and it involves more guilt. Nowadays some are economically skyrocketting (Tunisia, Vietnam), and in really poor places liked Laos and Mauriania voices are heard who call for stopping blaming colonization for everything that goes wrong in the country 60 years after it ended. Still, it's a common feeling that we have a part of responsability for the situation in africa, especially considering our neocolonialist tendancies.

These thieves aren't Spanish; they're (mostly) from Morocco. They're in the country illegally. They have no documentation and nothing much to lose. They're also smart - the robbery amounts are kept below the threshold of a major crime (like a felony) so the offenses are punished with fines, nothing more serious. Due to the way Spanish law works they can continue to rob with impunity and there's nothing the police can do about it. They have no legal tools to deal with the problem. 

This needs a legislative solution, and it's easy to think they should just pass a three-strikes-type law and be done with it, but that doesn't take into account the history of the country. It hasn't been long ago at all that instead of a democratic government, Spain was ruled by a murderous dictator and policed by a brutal police force. That left a lot of wounds and people aren't soon going to forget what that was like, thus the lax penalties for what are considered to be petty crimes and the great difficulty in passing stricter laws. 

I live in a small tourist town just outside Barcelona that has a lot of gay tourists. There's a gang of Moroccans that have operated here for several years now, with a foolproof business model: the sort-of handsome one will approach a single guy on the street and come on to him, rubbing his chest, telling how handsome he is, and while he's distracted one of the other gang members comes up from behind and takes the wallet and phone right out of their pocket. Usually the victim doesn't even notice. They do this in broad daylight, several times a day. The police know who they are, know where they live, and know what they do. Yet all the can do is write them a ticket and let them go steal again because they are ""petty"" thefts. 

In our case I think the local merchants have reached the point of looking at ""extra-judicial"" solutions to this problem. But you can't do that sort of thing on a large scale in a big city.

I'll preface the rest of this comment by saying I'm not an expert on Ottoman politics and am open to (and interested in) fact-checks. 

Official history taught in Turkey says the Ottoman Empire couldn't care less about cultural assimilation and only cared that it got its tax from newly invaded lands ([mostly true for local language, religion and law](http://tinyurl.com/yd8c3b), but for details see the next paragraph). Things didn't get very nasty with minority subjects until nationalism became a thing in early-/mid- 19th century. Most (not all) major revolts up to that point were either by Turkish/Turkmen folks in Anatolia and Middle East or by the military (Jannissaries). 

Speaking of Jannisaries, though, up to 18th century, they were chosen from -mostly Balkan- Christian kids, converted, raised and educated intensively for military (and also government) positions. This practice called ""devşirme"" and also the harem points to a rather unique dynamic compared to the other empires. It initially appears to be a horrible practice, taking kids from minority families at a small age and forcing them down a certain career (and converting to Islam too), but then again, come to think of it, it means that the Ottoman army, highest government officers, most artists and scientists AND Sultans (through their mothers) mostly ended up being of non-Muslim and Balkan origins. It created a very unique elite and was very inclusive (in a twisted way) of its new subjects.

Well my language isn't standardised so it would be impossible to learn in the traditional way and probably pretty difficult to learn if you didn't grow up there - you'd have to spend many years in Gib, try really hard and forget a lot of what you know about English &amp; Spanish in order to pick it up. So the answer is no given how it's not needed or advantageous to know it even within the territory.

As such I don't think that Hungarian is worth learning since you can't speak to anyone other than Hungarians with it. Perhaps knowing Hungarian grammar helps if you're interested in learning a Turkic or Indonesian language, but those are also not really significant on the world scene.

Let me show you an example. The sentence ""I've got pencils in my pocket"" in Hungarian would be ""Zsebemben ceruzák vannak"". The gramatical reason why it's like this is: ""Zseb-em-ben ceruza-k van-nak"" meaning (literally) ""pocket-my-in pencil-multiple exist-multiple"". With a language like this the natural way how you would talk to foreigners whose language you don't speak is that you add prefixes and suffixes to an existing word that you do know, like let's say ""pocketem in is's pencils"". Since Indo-european languages don't work this way, you'll be a lot less successful in communicating with an Italian than, say, a Swedish guy who has no knowledge of Italian.

Personally, I'm feeling very good about the situation. But it's easy for me to say that, since I don't have a mortgage.


Virtually all mortgages here are either pegged to the inflation rate, or pegged to the exchange rate. This is a necessary security mechanism for the lender because of the inherently unstable currency.


Both of these rates changed massively for the worse when the Icelandic currency collapsed in 2008. This would be a non-issue if we had the Euro. But because we don't, the implications for home owners is beyond anything people in the Eurozone know. Their mortgages actually got CHEAPER during the recession. Hah.

Most people think that the money taken out of our paycheck is invested but it is not true. It's just an extra tax that pays for the current retirees. When our generation retires, we will need the future workers to pay for us. A country cannot 'invest' in its own bond.

Since it's not really investing, but paying as you go, the real way to invest in your retirement, even at a country level, is to make babies. Social Security is just the same social contract as having babies that will feed you and wipe your but back when we were all farmers. The only difference is the scale.

Now, it could have bought other countries' bonds, but until recently it would have been a whole other matter altogether because of exchange rate risk. Even today, there's a risk of Eurozone breakup. The Euro is not as irrevocable as the ECB says it is. In fact, it has already broken up. A Euro in a bank in Cyprus isn't the same as one in Germany because of capital controls. Business in the periphery pay significantly interest rates despite using the same currency (so much for being work shy by the way, because good luck competing with German companies if you have to pay a much higher interest rate).

Long term, the prospects of Germany are not as rosy as they seem. They are not having babies. Also, if Spain goes bankrupt today, their babies will not be made and the young people will leave. Also, there's no social contract at the Federal level in Europe.

First part: It doesn't matter if they can be traced back. They all share the same sort of style. The vast majority have little to no cases, little to no tonality, similar vocabulary accross a sort of a gradient, and word order that isn't quite as free as in some languages outside of IE. Choose an IE language and you'll likely choose a language that is closer to another IE language than whatever else you'd pick from someplace else. 

For the rest, of course it's found in IE. It was a separate question. But as for the argument that it's not really different because you can use prepositions too instead of cases, well no shit. Languages can express the same content in different ways, with no language (in common use at this moment) being uncapable of expressing something the other can. 

I know finnish, english, swedish, and can due to partial mutual intelligibility understand various neighbouring languages of these to certain degrees (with finnish, there are many smaller languages related surviving in russia, plus estonian of course). I have tried learning german, russian, estonian, and norwegian to the extent that I'm aware of the basic differences in the languages. I've also read a lot on the types of grammar some language families have, without trying to learn the language.

Also, what kind of an argument is ""it's also found in IE""? IE is on average much closer to any language an IE speaker would know compared to languages outside of it. It doesn't matter if IE has a specific feature, a language outside of IE will still likely be more different, and thus potentially more interesting.

Secondly, culture. Yep, that old argument. Gaeilge is inseparable from Irish culture. Poems, stories, songs. Even just as a shared experience for Irish people, who can reminisce about their fear of the Teastas soirsearch. What Irish person does not immeaditly feel the dread announced by ""BEEEEP....

I'm pretty sure treasury bonds do not make up 97% of the portfolio though. There's usually also a significant amount of foreign treasury bonds, shares and real estate.

The difference to Spain is the motive to buy the bonds. The US Social Security administration buys treasury bonds because it's a pretty safe investment, not because there are not enough buyers for the bonds. I would think, and someone please correct me if I'm wrong, that Spain's treasury bonds do not have the required credit rating to be bought by their social security pension fund, but it's done anyway.

* If you learn Catalan, learning Spanish and French afterwards is like a stroll through the park.

* Do you think that Latin languages have very complicated verb conjugations? Catalan has the most simple idiot proof verb conjugation within the Latin family. You have to learn just 2 verbs: anar (to go) and estar (to be). With this 2 verbs you can conjugate like a champ all the tenses of any verb. 'Anar' conjugated + infinitive is for punctual actions and 'estar' conjugated + gerund for continuous actions. 

* Have you heard about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysynthetic_languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysynthetic_languages)? Do you want to have a taste of them without getting out of your comfort zone? Thanks to the pre-Roman substrate of Catalan you can have a little taste of them! For instance, we have the compound word 'capgirar' (cap (noun) + girar (verb) , head + turn) which is a verb that would mean 'to turn something upside down'. An almost complete sentence in just one word that can be conjugated like a normal verb and used to build an adjective: 'capgirat' (to be turned upside down).

Compare:

'I was turning upside down the table' with 'Estava capgirant la taula'. That's language economics in action!

true,charlofsweden,SWED,Stockholm,"&gt; One is that the hard left, communists etc. loved throwing around this term and really expected it to be insulting. Largely because the people they attacked with it were also on the left just more moderate, so they hated it. So if you accept this term you troll a lot of lefties with it. To them it sounds like ""I'm evil.""

I don't approve of this approach to politics. It seems pointless. Trolling people has never changed anyone's mind.

&gt; Second that it was generally associated with aristocrats like de Bonald, de Maistre, Chateaubriand, or Metternich. That's classy. What would be doper than posing around in gold and brocade and have ""prince"" before your name?

Yes, well, you won't be getting a bunch of gold and brocade to clothe yourself in just because you chose a label to apply to yourself. Likewise the entry to nobility is a bit higher than that.

Unless you already have a lot of gold and a nobility title just applying a term to yourself is hardly going to help you achieve those goals.

(Plus, the real money is in populism. Everyone knows that.)

&gt; Third, there are all these bit naive, bit innocent, good natured progressives today who can sort of imagine the existence of conservatives who are so dull that they thing things are just OK the way they are, but they can honestly hardly imagine why would anyone turn anything back.

true,Fairwolf,SCOT,Scotland,"I'd quite like Gaelic (Scottish) to be taught, but in terms of actual usefulness it's pretty slim. It'd be an interesting language to learn none-the-less. 

If we're going by Scots, I'm actually quite fond of the language, I find it's a bit more emotive than English, and it has a certain onomatopoeia behind it. It's not really actively 'Taught', largely because people still debate whether it's a language or not (It is) and because it generally isn't taken that seriously as a language, which is a pretty big shame. 

I think Scots' decline was perhaps one of the negative features of the Union, it stifled the language and culture a bit in favour of things being ""Proper English. It was treated as a language for the poor and en-educated, even as late as the 1940s, as shown by this quote from the Scottish Education Board:  

&gt;""...it is not the language of 'educated' people anywhere, and could not be described as a suitable medium of education or culture""

Scots didn't get it as bad as Gaelic however, Scots may have been scorned, by Gaelic was actively oppressed. Kids used to get the belt for speaking Gaelic in the classroom, for a long, long time.

No. A lot of people ""speak English"" but that doesn't mean they're good at it - or at least, good at conversing with native speakers. 

There is a whole different language spoken amongst non-native speakers that native speakers tend to have difficulty with - the grammar is easier and the vocabulary is smaller but the word order can often be jacked up.

Il discorso è che, se esistesse una legge del genere, un giudice può condannare (non è specificato il grado, quindi anche in primo grado) un politico per stroncargli la carriera. Non si specifica peraltro la condanna in quale ambito (la proposta di legge parla di ""appartenenza ad associazioni di tipo (sic) mafioso"", ma questo Articolo (ri-sic) non lo specifica, quindi potrebbe trattarsi di una condanna civile per aver sfondato il tettuccio dell'auto di un vicino con una tegola caduta dal tetto), quindi sarebbe molto facile per una magistratura interessata far fuori la classe politica producendo condanne, magari anche per reati effettivi, al momento giusto.

impedire a qualcuno che è stato condannato per qualcosa ed ha espiato la colpa, con reclusione o pecuniariamente, è semplicemente stupido.

My only doubts are for Cinque Terre, being a group of small coastal cities and not a big city. Which specific city are you planning to arrive to? 

Also when buying at the station counter you can always ask if there are some special discounts available (Trenitalia often miss to put promotions on the website). 

Also you could give a look at the new privately owned train company called [Italo](http://www.italotreno.it/EN/Pages/default.aspx) for the Venice-Florence part (they only connect the main cities, and Cinque Terre is not among them), it's waaay cheaper than the national Trenitalia company.

&gt;The main objective of the attackers was to gather intelligence from the compromised organizations, which included computer systems, personal mobile devices and network equipment.

&gt;La part de la sécurité sociale dans la dette totale est bien moindre que celle de l'Etat

C'est l'éternel débat de ""où trouver le pognon et à qui le donner"". N'empêche, [les dépenses publiques représentaient en 2010 56% du PIB](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=T12F133). Et si tu regardes les [dépenses par administration publique](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=NATTEF08335), tu vois qu'en 2011, on avait 532 milliards de dépenses pour la sécurité sociale.

&gt;On occulte les chiffres pour faire oublier que le montant servi en intérêts est ridiculement élevé et n'est que de l'escroquerie financière qu'un bon coup de guillotine devra un jour régler.

1. Ça ressemble à du baratin de gauchiste ;)
2. Toujours est-il que cela n'a rien à voir avec la loi de 1973. 
3. Ensuite, le terme d'escroquerie est inapproprié, les conditions des emprunts étaient connues par les parties prenantes. 
4. Et oui, quand tu prends en compte l'inflation, la plus-value réalisée par les préteurs depuis 1978 s'élève à 330 milliards d'euros. Dit autrement, si l'État avait prêté à un taux égal à l'inflation, il aurait versé 330 milliards de moins. Si on calcule depuis 1995, ce sont 230 milliards net d'inflation qui ont été gagnés par les préteurs. C'est effectivement beaucoup, mais cela n'explique pas entièrement l'augmentation de la dette : il reste les dépenses supplémentaires et les baisses d'impôts (dont [la plus grande partie a été réalisée par Fabius](http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/economie/l-etat-a-perdu-plus-de-100-milliards-d-euros-de-recettes-fiscales-en-dix-ans_235253.html)).

Once you know Catalan, learning Spanish shouldn't take you more than a few months (I'm being very pessimistic with my estimation here). The basic grammar is almost identical, Catalan has a few quirks related with pronouns. But these quirks will help you with the French pronouns. 

Tudo (Portuguese) - Todo (Spanish) - Tot (Catalan) - Tout (French)

Do you see that there is a pattern? There are several patterns, but they are mostly consistent. If a word in Catalan ends with -nt, in Spanish it ends in -ndo and -ent in French, for instance. When you know a word in one of the 4 languages, you can guess that word in the others with high success ratio.

Negli altri paesi civilizzati una legge del genere non verrebbe mai passata, perché basta essere indagati per reati molto meno gravi del crimine organizzato per venire ostracizzati dal proprio partito e non avere nessuna possibilità di raccogliere voti.

It can be argued that Greek is different from the Ancient Greek. I would normally agree but if you take an elementary student and showed him any ancient Greek tablet he would probably read it. Not understand 85% of the words but definitely read it. A High school student with only being taught 2-3 hours per week of basic ancient Greek for 3 years, would probably be able to understand and translate about 50% of an ancient Greek tablet.

Many books are translated from other languages to Greek, but personally I try to read a book in it's original language (if I know it).

Firstly you have to understand the Irish mentality, as a country that has spent the majority of the past millennium being suppressed and subject to abuse under a foreign occupation, there's a tendency for Irish people to sympathize with other occupied peoples.

Secondly, since Ireland's establishment as a sovereign state, Israel is the only country which has actively soured [diplomatic relations with Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland%E2%80%93Israel_relations) at all, and has done so unprovoked, on numerous occasions.


Also- there's a lot of talk about ""why an academic boycott, rather than a boycott on agricultural products/trade etc?"" 

While I agree with this point, it's important to note that there have been plenty of calls for trade related(and other) boycotts on Israel within Ireland, however nothing major has ever materialized.

&gt;Basically, yes, these people are wrong, but they are wrong for cultural and historic reasons which will not be dealt with by telling them that they have hurt your feelings. Instead, you need to either reassure them of their national sovereignty or explain more effectively why Germany does what it does not to politicians or to the international community but to the people you are imposing austerity on.

The thing is that national souvereignty is limited when one country will pull the others down the drain with it. I believe Greece was so forcibly saved because it would have took down the whole of the Eurozone down with it. When economies and threats go cross-country, the subject of sovereignty seems arbitrary, or a good excuse from the Greek policy makers to take flee from the hard reforms.

Also, I am not sure how far explaining can work. I have heard reports, even on this subreddit, that Greek media is somewhat subjective (Germany's as well, though). You are right, in my opinion the German government should maybe start an advertising campaign to reach more (of the common) Greek people, but what is down that road? Once politics become too medialiszed, you cannot go back. Think of the drama that was the American presidential election. So when normal media ways are somewhat ineffective, what else can you do?

Finally, you also have to consider that the Germans, me included, also tire from the whole crisis. When an argument becomes too long and uninteresting, it is only natural that one turns to short, simple phrases.

I don't know about the pre war/war times. After the war there were a lot of things different to the EU crisis right now.

The spirit of the EU is that the closer the countries are, the less likely a new war is. The EU didn't just suddenly appear but this was the spirit during it's 40 years or so of development. 

Also after the war, the front line of the cold war went right through Germany and it was in everyones interest in the west to have a strong West Germany opposing the East. On top of that it was easier, since there were simply less people involved with a much smaller economy.

Right now the idea is, I think, less about dealing with the current dept, but more with the systemic issues. I believe that once those countries put their economy on a viable basis there will also be more stimulus. Doing so right now though would however just bolster the current system.

Cultural reason : France perhaps has one of the richest literary bodies in the world, from the early medieval *Chanson de Geste*, to today, including the romantic and classic authors. French influence in world literature is simply phenomenal, and one needs to read these works in their original language, how they were intended.
Like Vercors wrote in his Resistance book *Le Silence de la mer*, if one needed to pick the best English writer it's easy ; Shakespeare. The best Spanish author? Easy : Cervantes. The best German? Goethe! The best French? Hugo? Balzac? Dumas? Molière? Voltaire? Corneille? La Fontaine?..etc.. Just too many to chose from.

Historical reasons : often and for a long while, French was the lingua franca. There are many historical documents, and still today, institutions, in French, due to the language's past importance.

Linguistic reasons : French has influenced many other languages, like Russian, but first and foremost English. A huge amount of English words come from French. Apparently, French is a pretty language (I don't really know - what I do know is that it's hard use - which is why French writers are so good, because they managed).",0,1365192782,null,0,false,0,c999e46,t3_1bq77m,t1_c999e46,t3_1bq77m,null,1431660308,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"My guess is that the ""named"" people technically don't own the companies; they will be owned by a small number of specialist people living in the British Virgin Islands - but the named people will have some sort of control over the companies.

I don't know how these specific schemes works, and am not intimately familiar with the relevant accounting stuffs, but if I had (or was about to receive) a lot of money and didn't want it to be common knowledge or be taxed, I would do something like the following:

* set up a Remainder Company^1 (R), owned entirely by me (maybe with a sham director);
* set up a Holding Company H, owned by R (maybe with a sham director);
* find a 'trusted' banker/accountant/lawyer/company/individual in the British Virgin Islands (probably through a friend who has also used them) willing to look after my money;
* have the Reversion Company sell the Holding Company to this person, for a nominal value, under very specific conditions including;
* - that they cannot sell the company without R's permission,
* - that they cannot spend any of its assets (other than investing its money, and paying an agreed salary or similar to them) without R's permission,
* - that R has the option to buy back H (at a nominal value) at any time.
* I arrange that all the money I want hidden/not taxed be paid into H's bank account (in the BVI).

Now, what does this get me? Technically I don't own H. So I don't have to pay any income tax or capital gains tax on the money I've made (and nor does H, as the BVI have no corporation or capital gains tax, and a 0-rate income tax). Similarly, I'm not registered as its owner (or director) so there is no public record tying me to the company (other than through R's prior ownership of H... but we can probably find a way around that).

The only people who will know and have records will be the bankers, accountants, lawyers etc., who should all be under confidentiality agreements (or duties as professionals).

If I need the money, I can always get back control of H (by exercising the option to buy in the contract) or ask the ""trusted person"" to advance me some of the money it has. Alternatively I could go to a bank and ask for a loan, using my ownership in the Reversion Company as security. Loans are better than money as I may be able to set off some of the interest payments against my tax liability.

The major weakness is that I'm relying on a contract to get my money back, rather than a proprietary claim - if something goes wrong (the ""trusted person"" runs off with the money etc.) it will be harder for me to recover it. But when this is being done on such an industrial scale, with some pretty powerful people involved, one imagines the ""trusted people"" will be playing nicely (and making a nice amount of money themselves).

^1 Technically I don't need to use a second company, I could all do it myself, but then things get slightly more awkward if I want to transfer my control of the money, or if I die; using a second company may be safer.",0,1365193929,null,0,false,0,c999u3g,t3_1bq6f0,t1_c999u3g,t1_c998702,null,1431660099,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,damaxoh,GERM,Germany,"&gt; That's not true. There isn't a lack of water but authorities can ask plants to shut down if the water temperature could get above a certain point. This is however a very rare occasion and is only a concern to four of the 15 inland reactors.

Doesn't change the fact that every system is depending on outside resources which are not always available. Solar requires sunshine, windmills require the wind and nuclear fission requires fuel, a safe nuclear waste disposal place and the general will of the surrounding population to accept a possible disaster which what force them to leave their home.

&gt; But there are enough times when there is too much energy.

I don't know what your point is. A smart grid with decentralized energy production is the only solution to our energy demand. Centralized power plants with nuclear fuel have no future in Germany. 

&gt; There is only a finite capacity of pump storage available and there is still the question of transporting the energy to it.

You don't seem to have a point here. 

&gt; The German solar industry is in a very bad shape and a lot of it is either bankrupt or sold to Asia.

You just pick certain points without proofing anything. I am wondering if I waste my time answering you. Anyway... the production of the solar cells has been sold off to asia. Same happened with most of the computer chip production. 

You seem to totally neglect the positive sides. Thousands of small to midsize companies invent and produce technology surrounding PV. Transformers, software, engines and than there are also the companies installing everything on your roof. And no... this is not done by Chinese. 

Germany is the world's top photovoltaics (PV) installer. Something to be proud about. 

You also seem to ignore biomass and other renewable energy technology.

&gt;The money went straight from German taxpayers to German banks who held Greek debt. 

First of Greek banks were the ones holding most of your debt and French banks the biggest foreign Investor (who even borrowed money from German banks to reinvest more in Greece). 
German banks hold around 23 billions € in Greek bonds and unlike the French banks they kept most of it and didn't *sold* it to the ECB. 

And they were forced like every private Investore to write off more than 50% of those bonds (Talking about debt cancellation Greek apparently never got).

Which would mean German tax payer would need to pay for 11,5 billion €, if we assume that the tax payer would need to cover all of their loans.

So a quick google search told me that the all the bailout packages for Greece reached a total amount of 240 billion € !

Germany's contribution to the ESM is a bit more than 25%, and to make it easier I simply assume it was the same with ESFS. The amount Germany give via IWF is a lot smaller and the ECBs part a bit higher though. So lets keep it simple and say that Germany gives 20% of those 240 billion. 

I am not that good in math, but 20% of 240 billion is a lot more than 11,5 billion, no? 
It is more like 48 billions. 

Do you still want to say that the German tax payer money went straight back to German banks? 


Let's be honest here.

Not many Germans think that there isn't needed something else to help to ease the pain for the crisis country. 
Most realize that Greece will never be able to pay back all of its loans (this is why we were a bit angry at Samaras when he personally gave us his guarantee that Greece will pay all of it back). 

ECB and IMF revealed as much last year, even Merkel herself gave hints that there will be more debt cancellation (yes more it doesn't help your point if you forget the 54% write off from the Private sector). 

You should also realize that no German politician will kill his career  for something which isn't needed immediately, but if you insist to have it now, you always can show Europe the finger and default.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt;  If I am not mistaken, Draghi mentioned yesterday something about the ECB proposing a solution which didn't involve a haircut during the initial negotiations.

I cannot imagine such a solution short of EU tax payers paying it all. Can you?

&gt; It became extremely clear that the IMF (who wanted a 60% haircut initially) and a few of the countries wanted a deposit haircut to take place as a condition for accepting a cyprus bailout.

Cyp participation was a requirement for a bailout, been for some time so not a surprise AFAIK. As both IMF and Eurogrp had a condition of ~1/3 Cyp participation in it's own bailout (BTW,seems Russia agreed), then it became only a question of where Cyp would raise it's share.

Then I don't know what happened. Perhaps we'll learn about that idiot proposal of general deposit levy in history books or smthng.

&gt; The ECB has the tools to fix the eurozone crisis, but there is no political will to fix it.

Sorry, no tools there. ECB cannot do what BoJ did. ECB is very limited by it's charter. Draghi keeps an eye on steady prices and that's exactly ECB's main target and charter. And that's what he said, from his POV it's not in his hands in this regard but gvts.

EDIT: Yeah, I do like pmorski too! But his interpretation is a bit superficial there. Draghi did emphasize something which should be obvious to all by now long last: *""I think one should always be mindful of what the ECB can do and what it cannot do. We cannot replace capital that is lacking in the banking system. That is quite clear. We cannot compensate for lack of action by governments ""*  
That just cannot be emphasized enough no matter how long it has been said again and again. That's just how it is. No tools there available. And when Draghi discusses low inflation and price stability he is not being evasive, that's exactly what he's supposed to do and discuss.

Pmorski's daggers towards Dijsselbloem are funny as usual, but then he's got a very good point about Laiki's ELA and it's transfer to BoC. Seriously. What happened there?",0,1365201539,null,0,1365209799,0,c99cjy6,t3_1bojal,t1_c99cjy6,t1_c995mdd,null,1431658818,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

That's how you proceed.  You get kicked out of your own country and then you become the least objectionable/unknown balls-up 'initiado-with-friends', or a compromise voting bloc leader there by virtue of nobody else being able.   It's the same across the hierarchy. 

Case sample: 

The President of the European Parliament could not qualify in an entry grade high school teacher programme, or a management programme to be a bank manager.  On qualifications alone they wouldn't even be able to meet the base qualification criteria.  Not to be elitist, but in this case there is no bar.  I could roll a dice and 'evens' say that on academia alone I'd find a better qualified candidate here on r/europe at least 50% of the time, purely at random.  Probably more so.  Some might say life experience is a qualifier.  The President of the Parliament is supposed to be impartial in his role.  In these terms Schulz has been an unmitigated disaster.


As for accountability: 

Four key leaders attended the Azores Conference where they planned the argument to the Iraq war :  Blair, Bush, Aznar, Barosso.   Three daren't hardly raise their own heads in their own countries they've become so toxic.  The 4th is still running the European Commission!!!


Rompuy has experience and political competence?  

His country, and its economy, is practically defined and sustained by the EU (not that they can forge a government most of the time) - that doesn't justify being able to manage it.  It's a paradox.  No EU and Rompuy wouldn't have any experience to run it.  Europe couldn't have picked a more EU-biased, self serving individual for the role.  It's like holding up a bible and saying it's true because the bible says so.   Let alone, name ANY major member state leader that couldn't run against Rompuy and demolish him in any domestic election.  He's the antithesis of statesman.  What happened after he declared the Euro-crisis over and then there was another bailout?  He literally went missing from the Parliament.  President of the European Council: just didn't turn up.

Then you get the likes of the commissioners.  Clearly they're there by account of diabolic deals, not competency,  The positions are bought politically.   Ashton...Foreign Policy?  She doesn't have a scrap in her CV to even suggest worthy mention of candidacy.  Experience in dealing with foreign nations?  None.  International deals brokered?  None.  Diplomacy or standing?

Something like that is probably needed, but I have yet to hear a good plan for it.
And Hollande, Merkel and Monti had a meeting last year, where they agreed that something like that needs to be done.

I don't think simply giving them a few 100 billions will fix the problem, it should be spent wisely. 

Spain, Greece and Portugal already received billions from the EU Budget as a Marshall Plan. 
Spain has more Airports than Germany per Citizen for example, Roads to nowhere and the like.

If we have to spent a few more 100 of billion (Which no one really has in the Eurozone btw. ) we should ensure that it continue to help them in the future and not only for a short time.

It simply doesn't make sense to deploy PV in Germany on a large scale.

And still you failed to address the initial point: The export of energy. It's absolutely not an indicator that the German energy market is doing well. Quite the contrary. The German grid is short of melting and requires some much needed improvements.

Meanwhile the heavily subsidised renewables are killing the energy market. Which would be fine if there were enough capacities to transport the energy to South Germany. The phase shift transformers will make this even worse. So cheap energy is available in the North but the South German grid has to be stabilised by ancient extremely expensive Austrian oil and coal powered plants.

Was mich an Reddit reizt ist gerade dass man so viele Leute da hat und bis vor kurzem zumindest regelmäßig auch gute Beiträge in den Standardsubreddits vorzufinden sind. Schade ist es dann wenn Empfehlungen für bestimmte Produkte und Webseiten gemacht werden die wiederum lokal gebunden sind im englischen Sprachraum.

Worum es mir also geht ist eine deutsche Community in der ich mich mehr ""zu Hause"" fühlen kann als auf Reddit. Ich will nämlich nicht glauben dass es einzig die US Amerikaner sind mit interessanten Startups und neuen, kleinen Webseiten. Mir fällt das jetzt etwa mit Bitcoins auf, unabhängig davon welche Meinung man darüber hat. Die ganzen Infoseiten dazu sind auf englisch und alle beworbenen Akzeptanzstellen in den USA. Natürlich gibt es auch deutsches Material und deutsche Akzeptanzstellen, aber auf die trifft man nunmal naturgemäß nicht auf einer englischsprachigen Seite.

Was ich weiterhin an Reddit sehr schön finde ist das Filtern der Kommentare durch Karmasystem. (Das Fltern der Einreichungen hingegen ist fehlerhaft wegen bekanntem Bias richtung niedriger Informationsdichte.) Leider ist etwa in der Kommentarspalte der großen Deutschen Nachrichtenportale wie Spiegel, Welt oder Zeit ähnliche Funktion nicht gegeben. Ich fände es sehr schön mit einem ähnlichen Anteil der deutschen Bevölkerung Nationalpolitik, und praktisch alle anderen Themen auch, diskutieren zu können wie es hier auf Reddit möglich ist.

Greece got a haircut and a reduction of her Debt level. 
Creditors lost money. 

Without the haircut Greece would have even more debt.

This is nothing you can argue about, and her Debt2GDP only didn't decrease because they found other holes in their Budget (see Greece Bailout 2 and 3 ) .

We can discuss if it was enough, but not about if Greece got an Haircut or not.

Talking about not being enough, of course it is not. 
IWF, ECB all said that there need to be another Haircut in the future (And both of them won't pay for it because they have special rights).
Even Merkel gave a hint that Greece will get it. 

But Greece will not get it now.

Not only Germany has loaned Greece money, even Slovenia had to participate in the Bailout (a country which a much much lower Living Standart than Greece).

And maybe you don't know it, but not only Greece has a hard time. Another Haircut could cause a lot of problems for other Eurozone members. Slovenia, Spain, Italia, Netherlands, France, Portugal, Ireland would all lose money, too.
It is not unlikely that a few of them will get problems with such a bailout, which could force them to need a bailout for themselves.

And don't forget, why should Spain, Portugal and Ireland write off those loans and not demand the same? 
(I am still surprised they accepted the special interest rate of 0.75% for Greece without demanding the same treatment for themselves). 

And what is the gain to have an immediately haircut for Greece?

Not only is the Interest Rates  of those loans lower then Inflation, Greece also get it back the moment they have a balanced budget. 

I don't see any benefit for Greece having a haircut now instead getting one in 2014-2015. 

Their Debt level is a long term problem which will be fixed in the future, but right now it would only cause problems.

Is Zimmer used more exclusively for specific rooms in the house, or can you use it for rooms in buildings generally? Does an office building have Zimmer? Looking at duden, it makes it seem like it's just for rooms in apartments/houses/places of residence.

Some of the same logic you are mentioning applies in English too I think. A kitchen is a room only in a more general sense of the word, and I would be hesitant to call a Vorsaal a room, though if I put up an ad for an apartment, and wanted to say how many rooms it had, I would certainly include a kitchen at least in the count.
