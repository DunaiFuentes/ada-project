My advice: use the search in the sidebar, there is a great thread on tourism in France every week or so, and a billion other threads. Tripadvisor is also great for France. 

The carte 12-25 ([link](http://www.voyages-sncf.com/services-train/carte-abonnement-train/12-25), it's apparently 12-27 now) is 50 euros and gives you a substantial reduction on train trips (-25 to 50%). Buy it if you intend to use the train a lot (you probably will) and are under 27. Bus is not so big in France, we do have megabus for Paris-London ([link](http://freu.megabus.com/about-us.aspx), I don't know if their service is as shitty as in the US) and iDBUS by the SNCF ([link](http://www.idbus.fr/)).

You had us pegged and condemned before you typed your first respone.  

How about we have no family here but lots of friends in Europe. Is that a good enough reason to move? We have a better support group out there. 

How about we lived in Europe before and really enjoyed the lifestyle. If I am going to work my ass off and be broke I'd rather it be in a beautiful city like Paris compared to a crappy American cookie cutter suburb. 

How about something more serious like I'm going to finish my masters in Neuroscience? 

We have an investor and an opportunity to open a restaurant out there. 

My husband is a teacher and got a good job at an International School. 

American schools are in decay and we want our children to have a better education than what they currently have acces too. 

Maybe somethign as simple as I want to live in a city where we don't need a car and public transportation is a viable safe option. 

This one should really be lost on you but I want my children to be multi-lingual.

Three questions:

1) Are they already seperate, and want them to merge? Or are they merged now, and want to be seperate? It seems like those go hand in hand, what is the reasoning behind seperating them if that is the problem?

2) This is how the UK operates its own energy sector correct? How does this effect Europe?

3) There were two other countries mentioned in that article that are being considered for the same penalty. What is the reason for the order of magnitude in difference between the UK's financial penalty, and the other two countries?

Okay, maybe a fourth question:

Is the UK trying to withdraw from the EU? Or is the EU trying to push the UK out?

That being one part I can agree with, along with a fair few other parts.  On the other hand there's some I where would disagree.  I'll him one thing, it's pretty decent rhetoric, quite convincing, however I am fairly cynical when it comes to right wing politicians and their rhetoric...  

For example a lot of the stuff he says about EU bureacracy stifling entreprenuers, the meddling ECHR... this is absolutely textbook Tory/Daily Mail territory for anti-EU moaning and nearly every time I actually look into these ""barmy Brussels red tape"" or ""EU's crazy so-called 'human rights' legislation"" stories I find myself on the side of Europe.   I would rather live in a world where people can't be fired because they're gay or Muslim, or pressured into working 80 hour weeks or getting no vacation, or sold improperly labelled foodstuffs or electronics that start house fires.   

Whereas the Tories in my view - perhaps a jaded, cynical, unfair view, I don't know - seem to prefer to strip away this all ""red tape"" with grand talk of economic growth and prosperity and freeing up businesses etc - but it seems like all the prosperity ends up in the pockets of an ever smaller number of people... It's doubtless simplistic to point to only [one graph](http://www.the-crises.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/gini-index-uk.jpg), but I find it pretty convenient, so I shall ;)

Anyway, all this sort of ""spurious regulation"" is often the territory where I'm bloody grateful we have the EU to prevent Cameron and his ilk strip burning our society to the extent that I believe they would love it, if that isn't too che-guevara-poster a thing to say.

Also, he bigs up national parliaments / British parliament as the real locus of legitimacy/sovereignty, which is... interesting, considering Scotland (Catalonia, etc).  

For me personally, as someone who has no sentimentality for nations nationalism, lives in London, which is / should be like a fifth country of the UK imo... I see a tier of London Assembly (or Welsh, or Scottish Parliament), which (hopefully) have genuine local buy in, and can address issues at a sensible local scale; I see a tier of European parliament, which can address issues at a sensible scale for modern global economic / geo-political bloc scale, single market etc; both these tiers have modern electoral systems, while the national parliament has a proven-ly shitty election system...

Well, if _I_ were going to swing the axe on some of this ""spurious"" bureacracy with a ""blue sky thinking"" vision for redrawing Europe and restoring political legitimacy and efficiency... I think my axe might fall in a different place to Dave's!

tl;dr - I can't really argue with his call to have a fresh think of how Europe works given the much enlarged membership, eurozone woes etc, but I would disagree with some of the substance of his vision of what should replace the current arrangement.",0,1359166696,null,0,false,0,c83q8hc,t3_178223,t1_c83q8hc,t1_c83ck01,null,1431081566,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

But I am going to look into it or get someone to do it for me, so as and when I have anything I'll try to remember to ping you.

On your last question though, the answer to that is 'neither'. The UK isn't trying to withdraw and no-one is pushing the UK out.  There is however a lot of debate in the UK at the moment about the UK's relationship with the EU, it seems there will now be a vote on whether the UK should remain in the EU in a few years, but frankly I doubt that will result in a vote to exit (but it should hopefully allow for a discussion and let people in the UK get a clearer idea of what they want out of membership..).

true,Lord_Monboddo,SCOT,Scotland,"It really is. rsurperq is quite right it is a descendant of Middle Irish which itself comes from Old Irish which originates in Ireland, it came to Scotland from Ulster into the Western Isles and the Kingdom of Dal Riata before spreading into the Pictish Kingdom of Fortriu (which became the Gaelic Kingdom of Alba then the Kingdom of Scotland when Scots or rather Inglis became the common language of the Kingdom) as well as the Kingdom of Galloway. Before that point the Scots spoke Brytonnic in the south (which was similar to Welsh) and Pictish in the North (which we have no idea what it sounds like other than the names of Pictish Kings). Pictish is the only indigenous language of Scotland (well Scots is indigenous but the jury is out on whether that's a seperate language), Gaelic was an import and has nothing to do with Celts on the island of Britain. It did not magically appear in Britain in 500BC, it arrived here from Ireland (also probably later than that during the Dark Ages). 

I would expect every linguist and historian would fundamentally disagree with you, where on earth are you getting this idea that Gaelic came from Scotland or Britain? Nothing bears out with that either archaeological nor in written records. You can actually see Gaelic arriving in Scotland from Ireland across the Irish sea historically. In fact all these points pale in comparison to the main one I should be making, the whole of Ireland was speaking Gaelic from way before the point it appeared in Scotland (and we have written records of that from Irish monks), if the Irish were speaking a language that was almost identical to Scottish Gaelic (the difference between Scottish and Irish gaelic are tiny and are more about spelling) before it appeared in Scotland do you not think that proves it came from Ireland?

It's quite interesting to see that the Iberian Peninsula ""ruled"" the world for 1/2 centuries in the past and compare all this with today's crisis.

FUN FACT: I read somewhere that the Portuguese refused Columbus's idea of reaching India by sailing westwards and later got there sailing all the way through the south and around Africa. We (the Portuguese) ended up reaching our goal but Columbus (sent by Spain after Portugal's refusal) discovered the Caribbean and most of the territories were therefore held by the Spanish crown (except for Brazil, ofc, which remained a Portuguese colony).

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't see anything wrong with broadcasting the meetings of the European Parliament, and I have to say I think it's silly to criticise the EU for lacking transparency while at the same time supporting initiatives to make it less transparent. Transparency, which by definition means actively giving access to the internal workings of institutions, does cost money and effort to maintain.

But I agree it could probably be done for less money -- the EU institutions are *not* very good at spending money, and I say this is a strong pro-European. I think there are structural reasons behind this, involving the fact that the intergovernmental nature of the EU and the need to compromise on everything means EU bureaucrats have a very limited space in which to operate and so in order to expand their own importance they're forced to complicate the limited fields they have control over. This started way back when Walter Hallstein was president of the Commission, it abated a little with the empty chairs crisis, but it's kind of carried over. I think -- and I know this is a counter-intuitive solution -- the best way to solve it is by giving them more real responsibilities rather than less, but also crucially to make them more responsible to the European public rather than to closed, behind-doors intergovernmental negotiations. 

The £14 figure, though, is misleading since it's obviously not only the viewers who are paying for it and we're not paying for the viewers, we're paying for Parliament to be broadcast. It would be more correct to say that it comes at a cost of 1.3p for every European (using the rounded figures in the article). (I recognise even that is way off the mark since taxation rates differ for individual people, I'm probably paying far less than that whereas someone richer in a stricter tax regime will be paying far more.) I'm happy to stump up 1.3p on my own part for Parliamentary meetings to continue to be broadcast openly and for clips to be provided where they're necessary on more mainstream news channels -- even though I don't watch the Europarl channel myself!

Public displays of affection such as kissing (and holding hands I imagine) have also been suggested, basically completely erasing gay people from the public eye and pushing homosexuals further to the fringes of society and obscuring their actual prevalence, allowing for more and more dehumanisation the more same-sex attraction is seen as an extremely rare, isolated thing as opposed to being evenly distributed among all levels of society, ethnicities and groups.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I've said before that I believe that many of the developments we're seeing more or less automatically follow as consequences of the way the political process in the EU is currently structured, combined with the domestic political (and economic) constraints that the various national governments that still make most of the policy have to operate under. This is an example of that.

I think we all agree that the status quo is, shall we say, imperfect. The Treaty of Lisbon brought some improvements, but even in most areas where policies already are an EU competence, decisions have to be made unanimously between 27 national governments. This alone means that EU policy decisions become issues in domestic political conflicts. That the EU is a convenient scapegoat to blame for unpopular developments doesn't exactly help.  

The article says that what this crisis has shown is that we need further integration, at least of the Eurozone. As we've discussed here innumerable times before, this isn't quite true. We've known this all along, since even before the creation of the euro. It's just that the necessary transfer of sovereignty over national budgets, as well as the necessary mechanism for automatic monetary transfers, has been something that was too politically inconvenient for those 27 national governments to approach, especially since every other month, one of them faces national elections. What this crisis has done, however, is to demonstrate the potential consequences of procrastinating on this issue further.

That this poses a problem for the UK is nothing new, either. Their economy is structured differently than that of the Continent, and politically this beyond of what seems acceptable for the UK. De Gaulle had already given this as a reason for vetoing UK membership twice. We might be past the old Balance of Power doctrine, but the UK has always had an issue with the concept of a Europe of Two Speeds, in which an integrated core would out-vote the rest.  
Previously, the UK tried to manage this by negotiating op-outs, the UK Rebate and by supporting expansion in the expectation that an increased number of members would, if not halt, at least slow down integration. This will no longer work.

So, the Eurozone has to further integrate their economic and financial policy, and as a consequence (or rather, a precondition), it has to integrate politically. Not just to streamline the decision making process, but for democratic legitimacy For the UK, this is very difficult to accept, and without a referendum it would face severe democratic legitimacy issues of its own.

Of course, the EU can't make any concessions that would be meaningful in terms of Cameron's suggested renegotiation. I think he knows this well enough. But it puts some pressure on the various players to come out and explain to the European public what their vision for the future of the EU looks like, so the British know what they'll be voting on in the first place. They obviously won't all agree on a common goal, but the debate is necessary.  
Losing the UK would be bad for the EU, and as the article said, it would be worse for the UK. But those five years should be enough time to explain the benefits of the EU to not just the British public, and for the EU leaders to outline concepts for how an economic, financial, and politically more integrated union could have a more transparent and democratically legitimate political structure. I believe this would be much more constructive than to base a campaign to get the British to ""vote correctly"" purely on the negative consequences of ending up outside of the EU.",0,1359178796,null,0,false,0,c83tdpf,t3_17a49e,t1_c83tdpf,t3_17a49e,null,1431083121,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I just keep coming back to the fact that the net cost of the EU to the UK is [£50m per day](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/8911689/EU-costs-Britain-50m-a-day-Ukip-claims.html), which is a LOT of money in anyone's book.  That may well be worth it, but I think at the moment it isn't (or at least nobody has yet made a convincing case for why it is worth it). 

I partly think this because it is paying for things that I think aren't in our interest such as the CAP or CFP, partly because a lot of it is wasted needlessly on things such as the caravan of politicians moving back and forth between Strasbourg and Brussels for identical meetings. I understand that it's a 'club' and we all have different interests, and I have no problem with give and take whereby we accept some things that we don't like but which suit the interests of others in return for getting things we want that some others may not. However I think for us, and for many EU countries, at the moment the EU is taking more than it is giving in this respect.

If he can make the EU more cost effective, and stop the Empire building that has seen it take on ever more competencies in areas that really, really should be better done at national level, then I'll be an enthusiastic 'European'. An example of that would be the working time directive, which I agree helps protect workers rights which is a good thing. However the UK is culturally very different to Greece, and we have different preferences for our working patterns. Neither is a 'better' approach than the other, but it should be up to us how long we work. It has no impact on France or Germany if we want to set our maximum working hours at six hours longer than theirs. There need to be protections for workers, but it should be up to us to set them, not Europe.
TL;DR - Pretty much agree with you, despite coming at it from the other side of the political fence I suspect, so perhaps there's hope for us all yet! :-)

I agree that a lot of the 'the EU is stifling business' talk turns out to be waffle or at least not quite as ridiculous as it's made to seem, but there is so much low hanging fruit in terms of institutional reform and needless duplication of effort which the EU refuses to address through institutional inertia that if we've become this bogged down after forty years, how Byzantine will the organisation have become by the time I'm looking to retire?

true,P_M_F,null,null,"I moved from the US (Denver, Colorado) for Prague about a year and a half ago. We will be in Prague for at least one more year, but don't know where we will be afterwords. 

We were (or really, I was) initially looking for something in Germany, I am half decent with German and I there are quite a few industry research divisions there where I could fit in. Before anything had gotten too far, my wife was recruited by a guy in Prague out of the blue. Although the offered salary was high relative to the Czech Republic, she initially turned the offer down, mainly because she would have to be supporting me until I got a job. He ended up doubling the offer and we decided to make the move. I found a good position about a month after moving here.

There are many things we like about Europe, but also many things I can do without. 

As for positive things, I love the lack of rules everywhere. I don't cause much trouble anymore; however, in the states when a police officer approaches me the first thought going through my head is, ""fuck what am I doing wrong right now."" That is completely gone here. I love being able to drink a beer on the street. I love dogs in restaurants. I love being not harassed every 5 minutes by the waiter. I love that there is no problem with the waitstaff when I order one beer and stay for two hours. I love the public transportation - I am not looking forward to owning a car again. I love the ski resorts out here - nobody wants to ski the powder and it seems I get the entire mountain to myself!

The main negative aspect of living out here is cultural. I really don't like the lack of interaction between strangers. Back home, if I'm hiking in the mountains (or walking on the street), people say hi to each other and occasionally stop to chat with one another. That is gone here. We don't even smile to each other, ""only a fool smiles when he has no reason to."" Shit, I see some of my neighbors just about every day, and they can't seem to have any more interaction than ""dobry den"" as we walk past each other on the stairs. 

The general lack of availability of food and beer also gets on my nerves a bit. Don't get me wrong, there is a shitload of negatives regarding living in the US - but a lack of good food is not one of them. I lived in a small city of 100,000 in the middle of Colorado for the past two years, but you could still find excellent Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Indian, Cuban, Ethiopian, and many other types of food. 

Also the beer - I love Czech beer, but drinking nothing but lagers can get to you. Sometimes I want an ale, I.P.A, stout, porter, bitter, weiß, barleywine, lambic, dubbel, or trippel. I just spent 550 Kč on 6 belgium beers yesterday, insane prices for Prague. 

Lastly, the weather. I don't mind the cold (I really like the cold), but the lack of sun is crazy. It is sunny just about every day in Colorado, it is sunny maybe 1 in 7 out here.

Overall, I love it. We are split between moving back to Colorado or moving to the Germany next year. I want to stay, my wife wants to go back to CO.

There are also a few arguments against Charles De Gaulle, depending on how you look at EU-relations:

- De Gaulle consistently vetoed the British application to the EEC in '63 and '67, and the UK could only join the EEC after De Gaulle was out of office

- The Empty Chair Crisis and the Luxembourg Compromise, which led to severe problems with decision-making later in the '80s

- His stubborn intergouvernamentalism

- His distrust of the UK was detrimental to the inclusion of the UK in the European integration and as a result it still has an impact on current European affairs

The fucking labour unions that don't allow for the regulation to be cut - businesses are being shut down for not being competitive and the youth unemployment is massive yet it's nearly impossible to fire someone who has the luck of having being employed before things started going wrong.

The dysfunctional government that has been raising taxes and making the whole economy even more uncompetitive to pay for the debt instead of cutting their still massive spending.

Bullshit. The government can only spend what it taxes so the net benefit is null.

Considering that you have to pay for all the bureaucrats and the impacts taxation have on the economy and the welfare have on those receiving it, there's increased unemployment from the taxation and there's increased unemployment as those who work lose the benefits, so it's actually a net loss from all government intervention.

&gt;If you cut them, there would be even more job losses as there would be less people to spend and damaging effects like higher crime rate and more prisons.

Again, you outright ignore the costs of those, ""job losses as there would be less people to spend"", how ridiculous is that?

If anything, the reduced taxation would allow the economy to grow and there would actually be a reduction in unemployment - like it has always happened ever.

But no, people like you think taxing and spending is good, I wonder why you still don't tax at 100% and give back at a 100% or 110%, if there's a net benefit, why aren't we doing it?

If we have access to safe, potable drinking water through the government or through private companies than we have access and thus our human right is not being breached. If you want to avoid liberalisation of the water market then fucking campaign for that and **stop saying that our human rights are being breached**. Nationalised water is great but not having nationalised water is not some how immoral. It's a very legitimate way to funnel water to people. We're western, first worlders. Our human rights are extremely well protected. In almost all circumstances our (westerners') human rights are not being breached and they're not about to be breached and especially not on a nation wide basis.

Additionally: This campaign seems to completely ignore how free markets work in theory. Whether you like free markets or not, it's making its claims as if they're fact and that's simply not true. I'm not saying they're wrong, but there's no consensus that says they're right on how this works. They claim that liberal water markets will drive down quality when in theory they drive quality up. (There's debate on this issue in certain industries but it is extremely far from a finished debate) Not only that but the campaign completely ignores the fact that in the EFTA we have quality standards for all produce which very explicitly covers water.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;I admire europe's social democracy, vs the USA's economic system.

No, you admire taxing and spending.

Oh, and the USA is hardly a model for the free market, they hardly could be more corporativists, the only difference between the EU social democracy and the USA corporativist system is that there the business lobby is dominant while here it's the labour movement.

Both rely on special privileges granted by the government at the expense of whole society, in both cases society would benefit if the state didn't act so actively in the economy.

&gt;Also, the government can only spend what it taxes? Nope.

For you to spend on benefits you have to either tax now or get into debt and tax later. There's no free lunch.

&gt;You do know how money is created right?

It depends on what's money. You could be talking about actual value or you could be talking about paper notes which can or can not be worth the paper they're printed on.

&gt;And the role of a central bank and interest rates?

What are you suggesting, for the ECB to expand the money supply and keep the interest rates below market price? Yeah, that did wonders for malinvestments in the USA, we should do just that here as well, having a bubble burst in some 10 years time.

&gt;When was the last time a business got worried about its debt, so it watered down the pound?

When was the last time a government got worried about its debt and watered down its currency? All the fucking time it still happens in some parts of the world.

Who benefits from this? Certainly not the people of those countries who see their wealth watered down because the government couldn't keep its expenses controlled and so taxed everyone indirectly through inflation.

&gt;Currency in the UK only has any meaning because it's backed by the government.

You're right, but I fail to see your point.

&gt;Also, when there are millions of people starving on the streets, you can expect a rise in crime.

Also, when there is a free-market system, people don't starve.

&gt;All the ""drowning the beast"" is just a code for pressing as much out of the state as possible while decrying its ineffectiveness.

[Drowning the beast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast)? 

&gt;""Starving the beast"" is a political strategy employed by American conservatives in order to limit government spending by cutting taxes in order to deprive the government of revenue in a deliberate effort to force the federal government to reduce spending. The short and medium term effect of the strategy has increased United States public debt rather than reduce spending.

This is quite stupid, if they want to reduce government, they should cut spending, not cut taxes without cutting spending as that will only lead to higher debt and consequently higher taxes in the future.

&gt;The invisible hand of the market will save us all.

The invisible hand only works for those who work. It's best than the visible hand of the government that takes from those who work and gives to those who lobby.

&gt;Trickle down!

Again, nonsense, wealth doesn't trickle down like that, no, a free market allows those who are most productive to thrive.

My cellphone is still a Motorola and they used to be a multinational yet they failed to adapt and now they're gone to be replaced with others who were more successful. Motorola could still be alive at the expense of the taxpayers back in their country yet their wealth trickled down and now others who were at the time down now have it.

&gt;Every house will only get more valuable!

Are you talking about the housing bubble? Well, they shouldn't have kept the interest rates so low for so long, people weren't properly accessing the risk of those investments and now they're paying for it.

Not the fault of the free market that their Federal Reserve kept their interest rates extremely low for so long.

&gt;Buy Buy Buy! Until we can't breathe anymore. 

What?

&gt;The result is sure a lot less anarchistic (rich people need someone to protect them from the many), but just as dire.

Nonsense, neoliberalism is in no way related to a military or police state.

&gt;Activist Grover Norquist is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, ""My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.""

Grover Norquist has a noble goal but is going about the wrong way of achieving it. Much like the people he so often criticises.

&gt;Me me me me me me me. I work hard for my money. I don't mind being taxed to make this state work -- what I mind is exactly the kind of stacked deck your ""free market"" policies effect.

I also don't mind being taxed if the money is wisely spend in public goods and services the free market can't provide such as a police system, courts and justice, roads and so forth.

But that's not what we're discussing here, roodammy44 was talking about social benefits. And as for income, the best way to provide it is to allow the free market to operate, not to tax some and give it to others.

Present me one example where there were famines on a free market system in which state intervention could have solved it.

&gt;In fact, it was the argument that stopped the government getting involved in Ireland's famine in the 1800s.

What? The Irish famine came about the potato blight and the government intervention that did not allow those potatoes to be sold in Ireland but rather kept exporting those.

&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith, an authority on the Irish Famine, wrote in The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-1849 that no issue has provoked so much anger and embittered relations between England and Ireland as ""the indisputable fact that huge quantities of food were exported from Ireland to England throughout the period when the people of Ireland were dying of starvation."" Ireland remained a net exporter of food throughout most of the five-year famine.
&gt;
&gt;[link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_%28Ireland%29#Government_response)

So don't fucking blame it as a failure of the free market as if they were free to do as they saw fit, they'd all have sold their products in Ireland. This was a clear failure by the English, had they allowed the market to operate freely, all of that would have been sold in Ireland and the famine would have been avoided.

Even on the next paragraph it says that ""Christine Kinealy writes that Irish exports of calves, livestock (except pigs), bacon and ham actually increased during the famine"", so yeah, the central planning of the English deciding what should be produced and where it should be sold as opposed to allowing the people to decide for themselves lead to this.

But that was also the case with the [Corn Laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_laws) which were abolished shortly thereafter, so yeah, they learned their lesson back then, unfortunately it was too late for hundreds of thousands but the following centuries in Britain were of prosperity.

&gt;You still keep insisting that we should tax to get through the slump.

We should tax to get through the slump? Where did I say that?

&gt;No, the government should borrow while the interest rates are low to invest in infrastructure and tax when the recovery comes.

Invest in infrastructure? What infrastructure do you need?

No, at least here, the government should not borrow, spend the lest it can and allow for the recovery to come with a reduction in taxes.

&gt;Government debt is not like personal debt, if it's in control of the currency.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;That's like saying socialism is in no way related to totalitarian communist states.

No because socialism leads to ever increasing government control (totalitarianism) while neoliberalism leads to ever decreasing government control (a free society).

Sure, a strong economy with a big government can lead to a police state as it happened here though that's not a free market society, it's one where businesses lobby the government for protection from competitors both domestic and abroad, it's one which doesn't rely on the people choosing for themselves but one which the state decided who should be protected at the expense of society.

&gt;Bullshit. Self-serving bullshit.

To reduce taxation and to make the government more efficient, isn't that a noble objective?

I'd say it's much more noble than say ""let's tax those who work and give it to x industry or y labour union"", though you might disagree.

&gt;Yeah, profitting from drug trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes sure pays.. Not sure how it relates to Liberalism.

Yeah, the average Swiss is a crook. lol

&gt;This is exactly where the free market fails. The way profits can be extracted while causing massive damage at teh cost of the public exactly pushes the economy towards destruction in even the mildest form of ""free market"".

No, you're wrong, it's not a free market if I can benefit at your expense (like when I pollute the river that goes through your town) just like it isn't a free market if I benefit at your expense (like when I break into your house and steal your laptop).

You're confusing a free market with externalities (as what happens when you don't set environmental standards) or with theft.

&gt;This is exactly why it doesn't work. People are no rational actors. To ever suppose that was just as ridiculous as neoliberalism.

Parmi ceux-ci, une tribu a élu domicile dans l'ancien Golfe du Mexique, aux abords du continent nord-américain.

That's confirmed by history.

&gt;Again, ideological phrasing -- meant to transport a certain world view which though it sounds so awesome, in the end is just greed.

Greed? Tell me a society that doesn't run on greed.

&gt;The reason our economies can work at all is because the state provides infrastructure -- which costs.

You're right, that's why I'm for a reduction of taxation and not the abolishment of taxation.

&gt;As such, reducing taxes is not noble.

It is if you're promoting state efficiency and economical growth.

&gt;An anarchy e.g. would have no taxes. 

But I'm not for anarchy, I'm for minimal state intervention in the economy.

You need to pay taxes to pay the police and the judges and the construction workers building new roads, you don't need to pay taxes to pay for benefits, subsidies and tariffs.

&gt;You are arguing for a dream world.

No I'm not.

&gt;Full true scotsman.

Do you even know what that means? Where did I went ""well, no true Scotsman""?

&gt;If it's bad, it can't be free market, no matter how much people have claimed it is and phrophesized the exact opposite outcome.

But it isn't, I gave you a concrete example, externalities or theft aren't a free-market, sure, it's individuals pursuing their interests but they're doing it at the expense of others, that's not a free market.

Here's [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market) on the subject.

""A free market contrasts with a controlled market or regulated market, in which government policy intervenes in the setting of prices.""

Nowhere in this it says ""in a free market you can steal and you can pollute your neighbour's garden whereas in a regulated market these are against the law"", silly.

I can understand your objection, but I don't believe anyone is trying to blackmail anyone else here; the trajectory of Europe simply is towards a higher degree of integration and a gradual erosion of national sovereignty. I am not certain, but am inclined to think, that the best route for Britain to go is nevertheless to forge ahead with the European project in a spirit of making its voice heard within a more federal Europe. If the British people decide that this is not for them, so be it; what seems selfish to me is to imagine that Britain can retain the benefits of being 'in' Europe while demanding that all other countries renegotiate the policies that don't suit us. It is, in the end, a fairly simple issue of in or out. Not 'accept all we [Brussels] say or get out', but 'commit wholeheartedly and stop waffling or get out'. 

It's the uncertainty and the lack of resolution - the attempt to have it both ways - that most bothers me about what Cameron is doing.

The understanding of economics is woeful - mercantilist claptrap. He seems to believe that remittances reduce the size of the British economy! Yet every pound ‘sent’ abroad must eventually be spent on British goods and services. (What else can pounds be spent on?)

In any case, the real problem is made in Britain: inequality second only to America’s and racism:

1. Too many British people are basically unemployable because of the failures of entrenched poverty and the education system. They are not competing for jobs – there is no work for people who can't read or count. It is a mistake to see Poles as stealing jobs that would not have been there if they hadn’t come (that is the lump of labour fallacy, which the author so dislikes)

2. The biggest reason immigration has become such a controversial issue recently is that British people of a different colour are turning up outside London in large numbers for the first time ([Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21568396-britain-becoming-more-its-capital-city-london-effect)). That is a perception problem (normally called by its proper name, racism) not an integration problem.

Isn't that more or less exactly what I was saying?  We (he) cannot commit wholeheartedly to a federal Europe because that is not what the Brits want.  And there is the language again - 'waffling'.  Cameron isn't waffling, he is raising some very important concerns about the future of Europe.

I don't think it is a simple case of 'us (the UK) and them (the rest of the EU)'.  As I said, there are other countries that agree with Cameron's take on this and I believe they will, having been bolstered by the first very visible questioning of what what is being assumed as inevitable (eventual federalism), start to raise their voices.  It's as if the pro federalists have completely stopped listening to any argument that doesn't end in a federal Europe.  They are obviously afraid of the debate.

Clearly blacks are a bigger threat to your safety than guns, this is statistics and acknowledging them is not racist. For all you know I may blame the higher crime rate of the African American population on their lower socio-economic status. It's only racist if I blame that on their race. I actually do believe this is mostly a racial issue, their environment doesn't help either but it's not the main factor since whites from the same socio-economic background aren't as criminal. 

You seem to have no problem acknowledging that higher levels of gun ownership lead to higher rates of gun homicide, why not do the same when it comes to race and crime?

France's subsidized market grab is not a problem because they now promise to do in future what Britain did twenty years.

With Germany you have to wonder how much of their pacifism is due to the Big Mistake and how much of it is due to the convenience of letting France and the UK deal with those inconvenient wars like Libya and Mali. I can't help but see a real moral cowardice in the German public's aversion to get involved in things like Libya.

&gt;But it does hint that if any big conflict was to happen in the next few years, the EU on it's own might not be able to defend itself properly, even though we got the nuclear deterrent.

Oh we can't at all. A few small countries can contribute in useful ways, Denmark, NL - but the only large countries with serious militaries are Britain and France. Most of the standing armies are an exercise in national penis waving and not much more. The nukes keep us safe, no-one can touch the EU because we've got around 500 nukes between your lot and my lot, but still, it's not nice to have to rely on them.

We need a unified military for this very reason. The UK and France are currently the only two nations paying enough towards defence of the EU, and we pay more than our fair share. If we unify the entire thing the entire EU could probably happily just have a set expenditure of maybe 1.8% of GDP - lower than I'd like but you know what the pacifists are like - and that'd provide a budget of 300 Billion USD. With that, and a single procurement process for all our kit instead of having 20 different assault rifles, 10 different MBTs, 4 different main fighters, we could quite rapidly build a large version of the powreful expeditionary militaries which France and the UK currently run.",0,1359217198,null,0,false,0,c83yt4k,t3_17ao2x,t1_c83yt4k,t1_c83yp1u,null,1431085760,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

So they're not meeting their foreign aid agreements, they actively campaign to keep Afrcan farmers priced out, which means these countries need aid, and they then get the UK to pay it.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;The german issue is quite 'special' to the say the least. I have had the oppoturnity to speak with quite a lot of germans and I still felt that 'Big Mistake embarassment' showing up sooner or later in the conversation.

Yeah but, like, how many times can we say *""Dude, that's not on you, that was your great grand parents. Your country is long since absolved, stop sitting in the corner just because 70 years ago some douchebag orchestrated some terrible shit in your country.""*

&gt;We have a somehow similar issue in France regarding budget spendings on defence, and to be honest, I for one is not a big supporter of investing too much in the military. But we (and I include myself in it) do believe that our national integrity, even the EU integrity is something too important to be dismissed and rely upon other states.

Yeah, in a way you're in a better situation than us. While the UK does like to maintain a powerful military, it's largely because of the idea that we're ""important"" and because many Brits still think of us as one of the big boys, which I suppose to an extent we are, but that means that in times like this no-one complains when we gimp our navy, or cut 1/5 of our Army.

&gt;As a matter of fact I totally agree with some kind of Joint Defence Equipment Development Program to be effectively reinforced, and to get rid past semi failures such as the Rafales &amp; EuroFighter.

Absolutely. The first step is development of a sort of NATO+ procurement standards, not just same ammo though, same everything. So that essentially we can put together one big military as and when needed and just slot together. To an extent this has been slowly developing with Tornado, Jaguar, Horizon class, Leopard, Eurofighter, and the new carriers which France and the UK are getting, all based on essentially the same design.

It can go a lot further though.

&gt;We have the abilities to be able to create top level equipment and weapons if we let a bit of this stupid national pride on the sideway, thus allowing us to compete with both USA, China and every other emerging block. And I also agree that a powerful EDF is necessary to defend and maintain our interests and sovereignty.

Exactly. It's about damn time that the EU started dealing with North Africa and being able to deal with the middle east as required. The US are going to have their hands very, very full in the far east over the next 20-50 years - we need to look to our own defence and our own ability to intervene in humanitarian situations.

&gt;Now, with the wild bet Cameron took, we might be able to see an evolution of the EU as whole, but that would be quite a loss to see you quitting that boat.

I don't see it happening mate. I really don't. I'll be pretty distraught if we do, but it kind of fucks the whole project.

I mean Britain, France and Germany make a great triple heavyweight combination for the EU. Without us France has to essentially become the military force of Europe, and without support from another large nation like Britain which accepts that it's a requirement of the forthcoming European nation, it could be the case that European defence continues to be woefully neglected as it is now.

It's such a waste too, because currently we collectively spend 261 billion USD on our military. We should have 4-5 heavy weight nuclear powered aircraft carriers, thousands of modern combat aircraft, capable expeditionary forces, dozens of amphib assault ships, maybe 40 useful destroyers.

As it is, we've got militaries like Greece with fuck all spending but 133,000 active troops (I wonder if they're any good :|) - Romania kicking about with 48 Mig-21's (I mean, fucking seriously?), and loads of fairly useless things like guided missile boats and gunboats, with a severe lack of destroyers (we have 19) and carriers (1-3 serious actual carriers in the EU now).

We could do better. We *should* do better. It would cost us no more than some national pride and acceptance that the pork might not get spread around in quite the same way. It would give us a *far* more capable military, capable of putting up a serious defence of EU borders against any nation or bloc in the world, and capable of putting a large combat force into enemy territory and winning any fight.",0,1359219750,null,0,false,0,c83zevk,t3_17ao2x,t1_c83zevk,t1_c83z3xa,null,1431086054,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Who says it's opt-outs for some? The whole argument is that other countries should have the same ability to take opt outs.

Note in the speech the other day the PM mentioned France and the UK in Mali, but that other countries shouldn't feel compelled or obligated or in part accountable. Effectively an opt out. He argued that small and medium sized businesses should be somewhat freed from overzealous regulation; that's something that Spain was calling for and could have done with during the crisis. Not just UK companies, for European companies.

AGRICULTURE:

By the same meter it is only mature to acknowledge that European economies are not the same. When half the EU budget goes towards CAP, and yet when the UK has some of the largest, most efficient farms, but obviously fewer of them in total number, the CAP doesn't represent UK farms for the better, but allows continental farms to close the gap. The Scottish even forced information using the freedom of information act. In it they found that corporations like Nestle and Tate&amp;Lyle had received billions over the last decade, whilst the average Scottish farmer had only received £9,000 per annum. Why are we subsidising huge corporations that already turn massive profits? From the UK perspective the UK wants to be able to take nothing from CAP and, if subsidies are necessary, to be able to tailor them for their own needs, to the most deserving, out of their own pocket.

FISHING:

People are all too fond of reminding the UK that they're an island on the corner of Europe. That also means we have a massive amount of coastline for our size and we have a large sea on one side and a large ocean on the other. When the Spanish joined the CFP the size of the European shipping fleet doubled in size. For 30 years since the UK, and conservationists, have argued constantly for meaningful reform. Every year 800,000 tonnes of fish are dumped back into British waters (British under international maritime law), dead, because of policy which has turned out to be impossible to reform. Completely counter productive to economy and conservation. Being an island this hits the UK disproportionately hard. Dropping out of the CFP would provide the UK with an extra £2.5bn a year before counting the extra costs of bureaucracy attached to managing the CFP; preserving a dying industry, removing some of the most harmful practices in UK waters, stopping over fishing through the numbers of ships, and providing a huge boon to conservation. That's not to say that the CFP couldn't continue on its own without the UK, but after 30 years, and a decade review last year which delivered nothing meaningful, the UK is being hardest hit, and continues to be so.

TRADE:

To address the UK's need for a trade commissioner. The UK economy is unique to Europe. Just as the economy differs greatly between North and South Europe, the UK in turn differs from the North with far more emphasis on finance and services. This means that when an EU trade commissioner goes on an overseas delegation on behalf of the whole EU, the UK's needs are not indicative. When the EU sent a delegation to India, India specifically had one thing on its bucket list: financial services. The UK had one thing on its bucket list: financial services. The Indians and UK were frustrated and manacled to negotiating around textiles and farming for months. Are we expected to believe an EU commissioner best represents UK financial services when the UK, along with the Czech Republic, were the only two states which refused the EU fiscal compact?

The UK doesn't need to be part of a large trading bloc, although it can still be part of that bloc and expect those trading through it with Europe to meet all the EU requirements, because of what its products are. We don't need to intimidate China to get a great deal any more than Germany needs to intimidate South America to get them to drive German cars. They want high end machinery designed to make cheap low end products - they come to the UK. If they want to extenuate a global footprint in finance, it's London. They want high end innovation, financial services and banking, top grade pharmaceuticals and chemicals. We don't need the EU to help sell these. We also shouldn't need the EU to trade with countries whom we share a Head Of State with! It's not an argument of empire. The commonwealth is built on recognising full sovereignty of others. It's just that through a fluke of history we find ourselves with a shared language, culture and history outside the EU, as well as having links to the EU, and going through the EU doesn't help the UK in these matters e.g. Switzerland should not be able to negotiate a free trade agreement with Canada faster than the UK.

POLITICAL INTEGRATION/SOVEREIGNTY:

Then there's the matter of Federalism.

In 1975 Edward Heath said,

       ""Fears that we shall in some way lose sovereignty or
        independence are, I need hardly say, completely 
        unjustified.""

That is how the UK voted. They never wanted political unity or judicial courts. For almost 40 years now it's small wonder that the UK has grown increasingly concerned. They've even been arguing for this debate since 1992 and Maastricht. Every time they secure opt outs and vetoes, legally and which others agree to, and then are harassed when they choose to exercise them.

The UK response to this is now fair:

You may have your federalism and the UK will never step in your way again. EU countries shouldn't however be bullied into either this vision of the EU or nothing. Let those that wish to go down that route, do so, but also let those that wish for a more flexible economic vision retain that too. There is no reason why it can't happen. Also, you should stop forcing countries into a currency as a necessary cost of joining Europe. It's disingenuous.

The UK is actually saying it will continue to be a net contributor, will continue contributing in European projects and defence. It is saying it will get out of the way of federalism and deeper political integration for those members that need it. It is also saying that over regulation, commitment to wasteful and detrimental programmes for member states who they don't represent, is killing competition within the EU, which is why countries in the EU are finding themselves forced to request bailouts. That the EU can have both: further integration and homogeneity for those that need it in the Euro, flexibility based around the Common Market for those that don't and aren't.

THE DEBATE CURRENTLY ISN'T IN OR OUT, NOR SHOULD IT BE ALLOWED TO BE FRAMED AS SUCH:
It's reform, until 2015 at least.

The debate for in or out is simple, since that's what you asked for:

The UK is already a signatory of the EEAA which guarantees the four freedoms i.e. the Common Market, signed outside of the EU and Maastricht/Lisbon. As such all the above arguments for UK and EU reform still apply to the potential UK exit. EEA contributions are considerably less than those of the EU, and the UK would only have to agree to regulations relating to the Common Market. Using the Icelandic ratio that means approximately only ~7% of them - whilst retaining all the benefits for the UK, control of the Agriculture and Fishing, and flexibility in trade outside the EU whilst still being a member of the common market.

                ""A report by the EFTA Secretariat in Brussels 
                 for the Icelandic Foreign Ministry that was published 
                 in May 2005, only some 6.5% of EU regulations, 
                 directives and decisions had fallen under the EEA 
                 Agreement over the first eleven years of its
                 existence, a total of 2,527 pieces of legislation.  
                 Of those only 101 required a change to Icelandic 
                 laws already in place.""

If more UK people knew that, there wouldn't be need for a debate!

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Do you think Portugal should move towards a more liberal, free-market economy

Yes.

&gt;like they do in the US

No. Like they do in Switzerland.

&gt;It seems like a lot of the problems you describe are due to heavy government regulation and massive spending on welfare programs.

And they are.

&gt;I'm not criticizing Portugal, the US has its own major problems. But I'm curious as to what you think is the solution.

No, you're right.

I just don't think the US is an answer as you have your own problems of constant public deficits, an insane spending on the military, you constantly devalue the dollar and raise the debt ceiling as opposed to cutting spending and/or raising taxes and you're getting quite regulatory and protectionist.

&gt;Also, why aren't other European countries that have large welfare states like Sweden or Germany as badly affected as Portugal?

Because these other countries get their money's worth in taxation whereas we spent it on useless shit like highways that we really don't need, airports without flights, stadiums for a single event and so on and so forth.

Taxes are not inherently bad, they are meant to pay for public goods and services like the justice system, the police, the basic public infrastructure and so on, these are a necessity.

There may be some problems in efficiency when the state taxes with the objective of redistribution but still, not all of this is bad, I for one support state subsidies in sectors like education and healthcare, it helps slightly with equality (specially equality of opportunity, as that's my main concern) and isn't that harmful to efficiency.

The real problem arises when a state taxes and outright wastes the money it levied from the taxpayers, and we've had that for way too long, that's why we need to reduce the scope of our state.

Sweden and Germany, these have their problems but they're still in great shape because they never allowed their debt to spiral out of control (whereas Portugal is now over 100% of GDP), these do for the most part get their money's worth in public goods and services and these don't over tax their businesses and don't compromise the competitiveness of their economy to pay for their welfare state (whereas Portugal has high taxes not only on personal income and VAT but also high corporate rates).",0,1359224529,null,0,false,0,c840n10,t3_17aebs,t1_c840n10,t1_c840g0z,null,1431086614,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

What I had suggested a couple weeks ago when the argument of sending other EU troops arose was that a few other EU nations could send in a couple hundred troops each (preferably Francophone and Anglophone, like Belgians or something), but France would finance their stay and they'd need to be under French command. I realize this is hardly doable, but that would be a first step to a EU army... if a country has the capacity to trust a partner with its soldiers for a common goal. France could easily just keep the non-French in defense positions in rather safe areas like Bamako, so the rest of the French soldiers could all go to the frontline. But yeah, it's kind of a stretch, and the politician who'd agree to give his country's soldiers to French command would be surely very criticized. So we could invent a NATO, only just for the EU, and say they're under ""EU command"" even though technically, for this first try, they'd be under French generals' orders.

And the EU is no gold standard on environmental laws at all.

Want to know the major driving element of the bushmeat trade in west Africa? EU fishing practises. When they over-fish around Europe they subsidise fishing trawlers to go to the South Atlantic off the coast of Africa. This depletes fish numbers meaning that African fishers fish less. With less fish on market stands people turn to alternative sources of protein, namely bushmeat.

You should also take a look at the recent Butter Mountain practises if you have a moment. It saves the EU money but keeps developing countries down, forcing them to resort to environmentally damaging practices (such as anthropogenic fire) to make any kind of living.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The Anthropological Review and Journal of 1866 claimed that ""Gaelic man"" was characterised by ""his bulging jaw and lower part of the face, retreating chin and forehead, large mouth and thick lips, great distance between nose and mouth, upturned nose, prominent cheekbones, sunken eyes, projecting eyebrows, narrow elongated skull and protruding ears"". This sort of ""scientific"" racism was not uncommon in the nineteenth century and was also directed against Jewish and African people. ""Without intending offence"", stated an article on the London Irish in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine of July 1901, ""we would point to this common feature in the Hibernian and Negro idiosyncrasy, that a dull manhood follows upon a youth of the highest promise"". This ""no offence, but -"" introductory remark always heralds a statement that will be offensive and is one commonly experienced by migrant groups.

Similar attitudes often lie behind anti-Irish jokes which stereotype Irish people as stupid or ridicule their accents, as in the Preston Lock-out [en dash, not em] cartoons. A survey carried out as part of Discrimination and the Irish Community in Britain by Mary Hickman and Bronwen Walter found that 70% of those surveyed found such jokes offensive and only 30% accepted them as ""harmless fun"". Only in 1994-95 did the Commission for Racial Equality commission this study, a move ridiculed by the Sun newspaper as ""a load of codswallop"". It greeted the news with a page of Irish jokes ""to give the researchers a flying start"".

I am haunted by the human chimpanzees I saw along that hundred miles of horrible country...to see white chimpanzees is dreadful; if they were black one would not see it so much, but their skins, except where tanned by exposure, are as white as ours.
- *Cambridge historian Charles Kingsley, letter to his wife from Ireland, 1860* 

A creature manifestly between the Gorilla and the Negro is to be met with in some of the lowest districts of London and Liverpool by adventurous explorers. It comes from Ireland, whence it has contrived to migrate; it belongs in fact to a tribe of Irish savages: the lowest species of Irish Yahoo. When conversing with its kind it talks a sort of gibberish. It is, moreover, a climbing animal, and may sometimes be seen ascending a ladder laden with a hod of bricks.

I agree with your wider point, but I should say on this, that a British Bill of Rights is not equivalent to the ECHR for exactly the reasons which you yourself have mentioned- MPs and parliament can change it if they wish. Britain has no constitutional framework for creating laws which cannot be over-turned by a majority in parliament.

Here is an interesting article about the legal situation: http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/11/obama-drone-wars-normalisation-extrajudicial-killing

Here is the important part:

&gt; The spirit of the constitution was quite the opposite: all of the founders were concerned, in varying degrees, with the risk of allowing the president to exercise too much discretion when declaring war or using force abroad. For this reason, the constitution explicitly grants the right to declare war to the Congress in order to restrain the president from chasing enemies around the world based solely on his authority as commander-in-chief. The founders would be horrified, not comforted, to know that the president has implicated himself in the killing of foreign nationals in states against which the Congress has not passed a declaration of war.

&gt; Beyond bypassing the constitution and the War Powers Act, the Obama administration has also adopted a dangerously broad interpretation of the legal right to use drone strikes against terrorist suspects abroad. According to his counterterrorism chief, John Brennan, the legal authority for the drone strikes derives from the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed by the Congress in September 2001 to authorize the attack on Afghanistan. He notes that there is ""nothing in the AUMF that restricts the use of military force against al-Qa'ida to Afghanistan"".

&gt; This interpretation treats the AUMF as a warrant to allow the president to use force against anyone at any time in a war without a defined endpoint.

&gt; Together with the bland assertion that the US has the right to self-defense against al-Qaida under international law, these legal arguments have enabled the president to expand drone operations against terrorist organizations to Yemen and Somalia, as well as to escalate the campaign against militant networks in Pakistan. To date, Obama has launched 278 drone strikes against targets in Pakistan. The use of drone strikes is now so commonplace that some critics have begun to wonder if the administration has adopted a ""kill, not capture"" policy, forsaking the intelligence gains of capturing suspects for an approach that leaves no one alive to pose a threat.

&gt; This vast, expansive interpretation of executive power to enable drone wars conducted in secret around the globe has also set dangerous precedent, which the administration has not realized or acknowledged. Once Obama leaves office, there is nothing stopping the next president from launching his own drone strikes, perhaps against a different and more controversial array of targets. The infrastructure and processes of vetting the ""kill list"" will remain in place for the next president, who may be less mindful of moral and legal implications of this action than Obama supposedly is.

&gt; Also in contravention of his campaign promises, the Obama administration has worked to expand its power of the executive and to resist oversight from the other branches of government. While candidate Obama insisted that even terrorist suspects deserved their due process rights and a chance to defend themselves in some kind of a court, his administration has now concluded that a review of the evidence by the executive branch itself – even merely a hasty discussion during one of the ""Terror Tuesdays"" – is equivalent to granting a terrorist suspect due process rights. With little fanfare, it has also concluded that American citizens may now be killed abroad without access to a ""judicial process"".",0,1359242922,null,0,false,0,c845gr9,t3_17bb0d,t1_c845gr9,t1_c845e77,null,1435638280,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The occasional leaked board camera doesn't change that. My point is that the threshold to go to war is lowered because it's to easy to rationalize it ""surgical strikes"".

Front line reporting reached its peak during Vietnam, and you know how this worked out. There's a reason why the Pentagon has changed its policy towards journalists.  
Your comment is actually an example for how well this works, because you assumed I was talking about soldiers, not the civilians on the ground. Going by your username, you're American, so that's no surprise -- your perceptions of war probably have been shaped by reports and movies from a soldier's perspective, whereas mine has been shaped by my grandma's stories.

Wut? Nearly everyone in Greece has ""higher education"", primary/secondary education really means ""people past their 60s"" and they in general religiously vote the same thing they did  3 decades ago. I mean say, would a political party as dumbass as the Golden Dawn get 5% of the votes of the ""highly educated""?

If you are talking about the people that in Greece would be more or less described as ""those that get high grades"" it's something like, the liberal arts/ medicine/ military officers/ career in education/ pharmacists will usually be by around 80% anti-reform. While most with an economics background/engineering degree/ business owners/ self employed, will be by 80% pro reform. And the above excludes all those that are heavily involved as members of political parties and/or their youth movement versions, cause, basically, they are all full of shit.

edit: In addition talking about Syriza and the KKE as ""the left"" is kind of misleading, I believe the majority of leftists in European countries would find quite a few objectionable things about both. Say the KKE officially declared the late  North Korea dictator a hero of the proletariat and often goes about how the LGBT rights movement is meaningless capitalist imperialist propaganda. Or say Cohn Bendit when he claimed that Syriza are lying / crazy / possibly corrupt.

EDIT: I looked it up : the CAP is 42% of EU budget, and France contributes 17.2 billion €, or 7.2 billion in proportion of the CAP.

EDIT2 : The above was 2006 figures taken from Wikipedia, I looked up the more recent [2011 figures](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm) from the site of the European commission :

* Total EU budget: 129.394 billion €
* Total direct aid to agriculture: 39.663 billion €
* French contribution to the EU budget: 19.617 billion €
* Estimated French contribution to the CAP: 19.617 x 39.663 / 129.394 = 6.013 billion €
* French CAP subsidies: 8.007 G€
* Conclusion : we still receive about 2 billion more than we contribute as part of the CAP.

&gt;Britain will see its population swell from today's 62.2 million to 77 million, an increase of 24 per cent.

&gt; while Germany will actually see its population fall sharply from 81.6 million to 71.5 million because of a lack of immigration, and a far lower birth rate than that in Britain.

From early in its life the Admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the Union Jack, whatever its use, and in 1902 an Admiralty Circular announced that Their Lordships had decided that either name could be used officially. Such use was given Parliamentary approval in 1908 when it was stated that ""the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag"".

For a start, it's in the rules.  As in, actually in the Lisbon Treaty, article 125.  Each country is liable for it's own debt and Sweden even has an obligation to make sure it receives guarantees before doing anything else:

http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and-comments/part-3-union-policies-and-internal-actions/title-viii-economic-and-monetary-policy/chapter-1-economic-policy/393-article-125.html

It's another example how the rules are constantly cherry picked.  They tried to make Italy provide loans to Spain out of a sense of community at 3%, when Italy itself was having to borrow at 7%.  Even the ECB shouldn't be buying government bonds.

It's aggressive federal negotiation through 'mutual indebtedness'; once everyone's debt is everyone else's problem federalism becomes the only option.  It's why the UK agreed to provide bailout funds but insisted on going through the IMF.  Or, another way of putting it, if we make it 'We're all in it together', we'll have to politically integrate more.  'All in it together' is the financial market equivalent of a medical research facility saying 'the Ebola escaped'. Choice will be off the table.

Well, we're not all in it together if we remember to stick to the rules and stop cutting edges.  The system is actually set up to limit exposure and to provide security, containment.  People are just being asked to ignore it:  AGAIN!

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt; Does the Scottish executive, whilst Scotland is part of the United Kingdom, have the legal standing to negotiate/apply on behalf of a nation state that's yet to exist?

No; powers relating to foreign policy are reserved to Westminster. As such Westminster are required to represent the interests of Scotland in this area (that Westminster is refusing to take up the EC's offer to discuss the situation is, IMO, unfortunate).

The Maastricht treaty refers to ""regions"" of a member state seceding from that state to form a new country; those new countries then have to apply like any other applicant. While Scotland is not an independent country, it is quite clearly a country (the UK being a state formed of four countries, not a singular nation state) - as such I think there is potential to interpret this with some latitude.

The most likely scenario, assuming this referendum passes, is that the secession from the UK and the change in status within the EU would be done in parallel. There's no real reason why the 5 million people living in Scotland, who are as much a part of the EU as any other EU citizen, should have to be temporarily ejected.

The situation with Spain/Catalonia is superficially similar, but has some profound differences: Spain has a constitution which is based on the ""undissolvable unity of the Spanish nation"". The UK does not, and both the Scottish and UK governments have agreed the terms and implications of the referendum.

But then I think the figure for th EU budget should be only the ""national contributions"" (which excludes custom duties: it is likely that agricultural imports/exports would change, but it is fuzzy how).

* Total direct aid to agriculture: 39.663 billion €
* French direct contribution to the EU budget: 18.050 billion €
* Estimated French contribution to the CAP: 18.050 x 39.663 / 103.216 = 6.936 billion €

No, I said he was British. He is also English. The previous one was Scottish, the one before that a mixture of both. So.The.Fuck.What.

&gt;Correct, unless of course Scotland leaves.

Unlikely, given support is now down to less than 30%.

&gt;I am talknig about 4 monolithic identites, three of which have their own governments to differing degrees. The united kingdom is by no means the single, unified entity it was 100 years ago and you know it.

It's still a single country, and I reject this intentional division across ethnic lines which you intentionally force for. I mean fuck me did you clap when Bosnians and Serbs started murdering each other?

&gt;Pulitzer-winning stuff. Genuinely asking here, if you can try to remain civil for a sentence or two, what is it about being british that means so much to you? Do you genuinely not see it as being ""more english""?

It's a completely separate identity and fairly dictinct culture comapred with  any of the home country ones. I mean for starters there is no English culture, to take south eastern people, Cornwall folk, and people from proper northern England call that one monolithic culture is tremendously ignorant. Same with Scotland, to a lesser degree, there's the north south split. Same north south split in Wales. I don't think I even need to explain the differences in NI to you.

Britain takes all that and sticks it all together. I'm not a huge fan of most of the aspects of Scottish cultures I can find, nor of English ones either, but I find that the British identity tends to put together the best of these, intentionally so, in order to make a good cultural and social mix.

So, yes, I see British as far more than English, and I kind of feel embarrassed for people who don't understand that it is, because English cultures and British culture are very very different things.

&gt;And now you've jumped into bitter, pointless racism. Well done.

No, just expressing a point, I don't know very much about Irish culture, you clearly don't know very much about British culture, or the various subcultures found within.

La question est donc de changer la loi, soit pour permettre à tordre le bras à Twitter, soit pour reconnaitre que c'est inadapté à internet.

La question n'est pas de décider si twitter est une zone de non droit, il s'agit d'examiner l'inadéquation de lois pensées à l'époque de la production d'information centralisée à notre époque de transmission d'information décentralisée. 

Et je pense que ton point de vue légaliste ne suffit même pas à défendre la censure : on a des lois, aujourud'hui, qui régissent la façon de condamner un Français qui commetrait aux US des actes illégaux chez nous et vice versa, mais là on a des Français (utilisateurs de twitter), avec un complice Américain (twitter) commettant à moitié en France et à moitié aux US, des actes défendu quasi-sacralement aux US et condamnés en France. 

La loi, ici, est dans sa limite : les US ne feront strictement rien pour aider cette procédure, par respect de leur loi et constitution. La loi Française peut à la limite reconnaitre que les utilisateurs ont fait une chose illégale mais pas les identifier ni forcer Twitter à le faire.

&gt; Est-ce que ce qui est interdit sur tout autre media en France devrait être autorisé sur Twitter ?

D'un point de vue strictement légaliste, twitter est une boite US, elle n'a pas à respecter la législation Française. Elle a les même droits que, par exemple, le New York Times. Est ce que JM Le Pen pourrait par exemple être inquiété en France pour avoir publié un article négationniste dans un journal américain ? C'est ça le vrai parallèle.

A la limite, le point de vue légaliste serait de dire qu'en France, Twitter doit servir un ""twitter France"" bien nettoyé, bien censuré où tout le monde est gentil, ne dit ni du mal des femmes, ni du bien du cannabis. 

Chacun se rend compte que ceci ne servirait à rien si on pouvait encore à accéder à Twitter US depuis la France.

Are you saying that free market capitalism would be the way to go, an a-la American way of farming? That will lower the prices for food, but so will the quality on products go down, and it will equate to a loss of jobs for the countryside, and environmental issues.                        
And why do you think the food produced is of a worse quality for a higher price? I don't think this has any basis in reality, most of the food grown within the EU is highly regulated to ensure a higher standard. Regulation does raise the price for food, but I rather think that environmental and animal welfare regulations, should be something all western nations should have.

Because subsidies are generally awarded by quantity rather than quality.

However the quality that goes to food specialisation etc. can only be ensured by user buying preferences. The CAP undermines this process.

The whole 2113 thing you keep saying is your way of trying to paint me as a ""conspiracy nut"" by thinking there is some 100 year plan in the works, it is just your idiotic way of trying to prove me wrong. What I said was that Germany will need to find ways to power its booming economy for the next 50-100 years which IS TRUE, especially since they have or are planning to ban ALL nuclear energy in Germany after the Japan meltdown.

What is going in greece has been done NUMEROUS times before, this is the thing you do not understand because you are too ignorant or naive to believe to have happened. Just read one of the numerous books or numerous documentarys on this subject. 

The IMF has in the last 40 years gone to multiple countries with natural resource . . ""Helped"" them by giving them Massive loans they knew were impossible to pay off with Masive interest rates(7% in greece, unheard of) .  . 

Then when the time comes to pay and they are unable to, a strategy by the IMF comes into play where the debt is ""re-structured"" and then the in-debited country has to hand over natural resources hubs/infrastructure for pennies on the $ or allow the IMF controlled corporations to go in there and set everything up. 

This is not some crazy ""theory"" like aliens or 9/11 . . . this has happend dozens of times already, and the same thing is happening in Greece. 

Only a year after getting this ""generous"" loan from Germany, Greece has gone into a Great Depression and forced to firesale there infrastructure now . . 

Greece is not going to be a protectorate by 2113, it already is.
