Actually one thing that occurred to me as I write this that might help explain why there are many anti-EU people in Britain... There is *strong* anti-immigration (not anti-Immigrant) sentiment in this country. So then the people ask the government ""Okay, can we be like Australia and Canada and put restrictions on immigration?"" And the answer is ""No, we're a member of the EU which means freedom of movement in and out of the country."" *Therefore* people want us to leave the EU *so that* we can restrict immigration. There's this perception here of 'benefits tourism' or 'healthcare tourism'. UKIP say all this stuff about how we should be trading more with non-EU countries and sovereignty and blah blah, but in my opinion I think the *driving force* behind their support is that the EU is the obstacle in the way of restrictions on immigration. I think if we were allowed more control over immigration, UKIP's support would quickly collapse.

to the rest, I have not much else to add. for you it's a matter of degree, for me a matter of principle. one can argue forever where that degree should be because there is no objective truth to it, only various personal ideologies (I have stated mine, you have stated yours; which BTW I find very strange, so you believe a citizen from zimbabwe or cuba or any other country that allows emigration (of which I only know north korea) shouldn't be allowed to keep their saving from being taxed even though they have no voice in the matter, or if they do, they are in a minority? they can theoretically move to a democratic country but they can't practically, largely because they are taxed so heavily and are left with no way of emigrating due to lack of finances).

I think switzerland should do what is in their best interest as everyone else, and if they are getting too much of other countries taxes those other countries can and should pressure switzerland (trade restrictions, etc) to change their laws to stop it (which IIRC is starting to happen, [yes it is](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-14/swiss-government-panel-recommends-automatic-data-exchange.html)), if people are willing to risk going to jail for tax evasion maybe also is a sign that their countries tax rates are too high.",0,1380496452,null,0,false,0,cchuc2g,t3_1n8l97,t1_cchuc2g,t1_cchs9xb,null,1429300396,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm just wondering, why were you denied a work permit? I know a guy from Australia who got one without problems. He just said he wants to work as a bartender for the time he's there.
Here are a few options:

1) You stay, work illegally on construction sites as a common laborer (nothing to be ashamed of; I did that, despite my legal status, and the payment was ok because I didn't pay taxes of course), eventually get caught by the BuPo, fined and deported back to Canada.

2) You do a 3-month vacation in another country (e.g. Bosnia, Serbia, Turkey) and come back with a fresh (3-month) tourist visa.

3) You look for a job that meets your qualifications or you have a bonus for being Canadian/a foreigner (Germans like Canadians more than US-Americans, you're considered exotic, but not crazy;) like e.g. bartending at the Kiez and bring your future employer on your side. If he's willing to give you a job and the only thing in the way is a work permit, you have better chances to convince government officials. It's worth a try. But the two of you (your future employer and you) must be serious, or at least act like that.

However I don't think you can jump from that to saying that it's their focus as a campaign (Scottish Labour's own former leader believes they focus on ""[fear and scare tactics](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-ditch-no-campaign-mcleish-1-2992714)"" - I find it hard to disagree with that assessment).

A good example would be Ed Miliband's conference speech last week, where he discussed the example of a woman from Glasgow who required specialist treatment at a hospital in England. Her two key points were ""I would ask Alex Salmond how we would pay for the NHS"" and ""could I keep the ongoing help and support I receive in England"".

The Scottish NHS is currently devolved, so it would be paid for in the same way as it is today - primarily by revenue generated in Scotland. She would also continue to be eligible for the same treatment - as with any patient at that specialist unit, the bill would be sent back to the health service that referred her (as they do today with Irish patients).

Better Together also released the infamous ""[500 questions](http://b.3cdn.net/better/38a382b210f856a0e2_5zm6b1yew.pdf)"" document, including such critical issues as ""Would a separate Scotland enter teams into the Olympics and Paralympics?"" and ""What work has been carried out to assess the attractiveness of a separate Scotland to Internet Service Providers?"". I find it hard to see that as a serious attempt at positive campaigning.

Yes Scotland have compiled [a list of responses](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yesscotland/pages/1755/attachments/original/1373290492/YES_A4_Project_Fear_July13.pdf) for those that actually got some play in the media. Perhaps a partisan view, but they do provide sources for the stories and a reasonable sounding answer to each.

If you ask me what Better Together could do, I would like to hear positive stories about what further political devolution the Labour/Conservative parties plan? Or why reducing healthcare devolution (floated by Labour last week) are beneficial for Scotland?

Sure!

The issue can present itself in other forms, like media brainwashing or an overly restrictive framework where legal parties must fit.

&gt; Would a super-national district system be a solution? With every district of equal weight and value?

It would be a possible solution. The main drawback is that we would have people in less populated areas having more electoral power per individual than their counterparts in dense areas, which can be argued to be an unfair distribution. On the other hand, if every vote weighed the same, very populated areas could form stronger voting blocks in certain issues to further their interests.

&gt;You could move them outside the town where there's plenty of space and perhaps build a large shelter there, but they don't want to live there because it's far from the city center where they can beg.

&gt;So what is the proper solution?

that would work if all homeless would be willing to go to those shelters, which is not the case. making it obligatory to have somewhere to sleep and shower, etc might work in conjunction, but how do you enforce this? if they still don't want do you jail them? costing the taxpayer even more then paying for a cheap accommodation that they would accept? IDK... I think it's more of a ethical question then a practical one. there are many actions that would result in no homeless people, but to choose the best most righteous, is a more complex issue that involves basic ethical questions that there is no clear consensus or even majority on.",0,1380501169,null,0,1380501915,0,cchvt82,t3_1nd4b5,t1_cchvt82,t3_1nd4b5,null,1429299707,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

If the parents choose to mutilate their childs genitals, (or frankly, mutilate their child in any way) they will be prosecuted and go to jail.

I guess they could permanently move abroad never to return if it is very important for them to permanently damage their child, but I expect most of them would stop.

Okay, but bringing a child to church doesn't leave the kind of physical evidence left by FGM. How would the state know that the child was being brought up with a religious upbringing?

The ministers and the churchgoing population will generally be united in refusal to reject their children from churches.

If his past record is one of breaking promises and doing things his electorate doesn't approve of, then he doesn't get votes. this is the theory; the problem is that most people are too apathetic/lazy/ignorant/stupid to do some proper research or to value proper research made by others (IE investigative journalists), thus they just listen to some public campaigns by the politicians themselves (not even their debates) and go with a kind of ""gut feeling"" of them, or simply vote on family traditional parties because they trust their older family members.",0,1380514401,null,0,false,0,cci0air,t3_1nddy2,t1_cci0air,t1_cchk5fe,null,1429297544,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

I'm not secure about what you mean here... do you mean direct or representative democracies? or do you mean rated, plurality, preferential voting systems? or something else? Anyway my contribution is that range-voting is the most representative of all single-winner (and probably multiple-winner also) elections. [here's some data](http://rangevoting.org/) that proves it to me (if anyone can find a flaw in this proof, I'd be very interested in hearing about it)

&gt;Do you think Europe can be more democratic? Should it?

of course it can, as long as not every decision is decided by the people directly it can be more democratic. how democratic and in what way is a better question, but one that is very complex and has many theories with very little evidence.

&gt;Do you consider the EU a democracy?

EU is a democracy IMO because the governing bodies are more or less directly or indirectly voted in by universal suffrage (18 and over).


Edit:

some general thoughts:

I still see a major problem in all democracies, that is: there's blatant tyranny of the majority; sure there are constitutional rights, but did *everyone* consent to that constitution? no. does everyone or even a majority consent to that constitution? not everyone, and a absolute majority also not, a simple majority we don't know. Fact is that majority rules is tyranny of the majority, there's not 2 ways about it. The best solution I've come up with is to institutionalize the most fundamental right for every individual: the right to be sovereign over one' own person. (second to this is extending that right to ones property, but that already comes into complex implications and grey areas situations). Of course this is not perfect, like who is an individual (how old? how mentally able? how human?) and more philosophically but nevertheless essential: where does a individual and their sovereignty begin and end? I mean, ultimately lots of things affect us, noise, air particles, light, the environment of the earth, other people and animals, etc, so where does one draw the lines? that is a matter of opinion, thus reverts back to a communal decision, thus a democratic tyranny of the majority.

Ultimately it's tyranny of the most powerful, that is the law of physics, we are deterministic cogs in the machine we call the universe. Anyway, getting a bit sidetracked here...

Yeah, so individual sovereignty to mitigate tyranny (of all kinds including majority)",0,1380516897,null,0,1380518010,0,cci0z12,t3_1nddy2,t1_cci0z12,t3_1nddy2,null,1429297227,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I would guess that the UK population vs contribution ratio is fairly similar to that of other European nations with similar populations like Germany.

true,Carnifex,null,null,"Eh .. Problem: IPv4 IP Adressen gehen aus. Lange bekannt, es gibt schon lange eine Lösung: IPv6 mit einer anderen Adressierung. Nur, seit Jahren kümmert sich so gut wie keiner drum, nur wenige ISPs und Rechenzentrenbetreiber steigen um. Ist halt ein wenig Aufwand und so. Bedingt durch die vielen Mobilgeräte, kommt das aber so langsam in Fahrt.

Unitymedia bezieht (soweit ich informiert bin) seine IPv4 Adressen aus dem Pool der Telekom. Diese hat UM nun den Hahn relativ zugedreht. Ergo vergeben sie an Neukunden nur noch IPv6 Adressen.

Das Problem:

Um aus dem IPv6 Adressraum in den IPv4 Adressraum zu kommen (95% des restlichen Internets!) braucht man einen Umsetzer. So in etwa wie dein Router zu Hause für deine 2-3 Geräte dafür sorgt dass sie aus deinem Heimnetz ins Internet kommen. Das macht bei UM der DS-Lite Knoten. Das ist also quasi ein Flaschenhals über den alle müssen die ins IPv4 Netz wollen - denn IPv6 machen halt noch nicht viele Webseiten. Der ist bei mir auch mal ausgefallen, mit dem Effekt dass ich quasi nur noch Google, Youtube und heise.de nutzen konnte. Selbst die UM Webseite geht nicht über IPv6! Und halt wie oben erwähnt - wenn das Ding überlastet ist, trennt es halt mal Verbindungen.

Dazu kommt noch: das Internet ist mehr als ein wenig surfen. So funktioniert DS-Lite nämlich nur in eine Richtung: von einem IPv6 UM Anschluss in das IPv4 Netz. Wenn man nun zu Hause Dienste laufen hat,  z.B.: eine private Cloud mit meiner Musik oder auch Heimautomatisierung wie Heizungssteuerung oder ähnlichem, heisst das ich kann die von einem Freund aus oder von der Arbeit aus nicht ansprechen, da man halt im Normalfall im IPv4 Netz ist. Ich kann meinen Heimanschluss aus dem IPv4 Netz heraus NICHT erreichen. 

Problematisch auch für Gamer: die Zwischenstation DS-Lite Knoten kostet erheblich Latenz. Bis vor kurzem gab es auch Probleme mit diversen Konsolen und deren Internetplattform. Das soll wohl aber nun gehen. Dennoch gibt es z.B. noch alte VPN Clients die von manchen Firmen aber vorrausgesetzt werden, die damit nicht klar kommen.

Es gibt Dienstleister die die IPv4-IPv6 Verbindungen ermöglichen (quasi wie DS-Lite nur umgekehrt). Aber wieso soll ich bitte für so etwas noch extra zahlen? Ich war besonders stinking weil da nirgendwo vorher drauf hingewiesen wird. Und der Kundendienst sich entweder doof stellt oder doof ist. Ich erwarte von keinem dass er die Hintergründe kennt.

Riguardo al secondo punto, non è una violazione se la modifica viene effettuata secondo le regole del precedente articolo 138. Riguardo al primo punto, è un'opinione legittima ma pericoloso non significa incostituzionale.

Riguardo il conflitto di interessi, alla fine si sta dimostrando una tempesta in un bicchier d'acqua.

true,Innominate8,null,null,"&gt; Is mental health a big contributing factor to some people being homeless?

It's most of it.  It's pretty difficult to be homeless from mere poverty.

You do run into a bit of a semantics problem with the meaning of ""homeless"".  There are homeless people who are sleeping in their car while trying to save for a place to live.  There are homeless people who live out of shelters, or who depend on the kindness of friends/family for a place to stay.  These aren't the people I'm talking about, while many of them are in a bad situation, getting out of it is generally within their ability.

Then there's the homeless who live and sleep on the street with no hope of getting out.  This is the group that people tend to think of when they talk about homelessness and it's utterly dominated by the severely mentally ill.  These aren't people who simply don't have a job, they tend to be unemployable.  They simply cannot function within our society and so are either shunned or withdraw themselves.  Even in countries where help is readily available, many mental illnesses make their sufferers hostile to the idea that there is anything wrong with them, or that they even need help.

On a side note - in Commonwealth there was the highest nobility (szlachta) to peasants ratio in whole Europe (approx. 10%!)

The very important noble family in the Commonwealth - [Radziwill / Radvila](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82) has self-polonised, but always stayed loyal to their Lithuanian ancestry (which many times caused major conflicts in the country as a whole). In effect they happened to be called ""traitors"" by both Poles and Lithuanians... tough luck, eh?

I would say it's really very complicated, my friend... ;) 

The least we can do is not to you use someone's ancestry / national background to stereotype or blame them for anything.

true,G_Morgan,WALE,Wales,"The worse thing about it all is the reason it has come to this is we managed to legally claw the power back to Britain. The HRA was about giving British courts the ability to rule on ECHR style judgements before going to Strasbourg. All in all a reasonable policy and it was assumed the Strasbourg judges would take the British judges comments on the cultural leeway the law allows into consideration.

This policy was a complete victory. The vast bulk of ECHR judgements now stop in the UK. So what is the problem?

It turns out the judges disagree with government on what actually constitutes the cultural norms of the UK and historic interpretation of what the treaties mean. The UK judges, with all the legitimate sovereign authority they have as a UK body, take a far harder line than Strasbourg. They assert that in actual fact Britain doesn't like countries that torture people (imagine that).

This is why the talk has been about a ""British Bill of Rights"" which removes the cultural leeway clauses and forces the British judges to give the rulings the government wants. Of course we'd need to leave the ECHR to do this. The judgements that have already taken place mean that the understanding the government didn't want is enshrined in UK law unless they leave the entire mechanism. If we want to deport people to places they might be tortured, based upon shaky evidence, we'll have to leave the ECHR.",0,1380532975,null,0,1380533521,0,cci3pwi,t3_1ndbpq,t1_cci3pwi,t1_cchjaph,null,1429295946,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,rensch,NETH,The Netherlands,"Quick history lesson of The Netherlands so you guys might understand some of our cultural tendencies better:

- First gained independence from Spain after a mostly protestant uprising in the 1500s led by William 'the Silent' of Orange, the father of the nation. He is our George Washington. Protestants like William of Orange, an influential nobleman, weren't granted the same rights as catholics by the Spanish king. This resulted in an uprising.

- After the independence in 1581 a new republic was founded that encompassed roughly the current Benelux area. In the 1600s and 1700s his quickly evolved in a powerful but ruthless slave empire, encompassing places like Indonesia, Manhattan and South Africa. This age was known as the 'Dutch Golden Age' and saw The Netherlands become the world's most modern, powerful and wealthy trade empire. This was the age of thinkers like Baruch Spinoza and Desiderius Erasmus. It was the age of seafarers such as Admiral Michaël Adriaanszoon de Ruyter and Willem Barentsz. It was also the age of Dutch Masters such as Jan Steen, Rembrandt van Rijn and Johannes Vermeer. Jews and catholics were mostly tolerated and some were even influential in areas were many of them lived. This is the first stirring of our culture of toleration and liberalism. In the colonies, however, the United East-Indian Company, the world's first multinational, and the West-Indian Company enslave Africans to ship them to foreign lands. Many die during the trip. The famous tulips also become popular during this period when we first import them from Turkey. This leads to the 'Tulip Crisis', a phenomenon not unlike what we saw in 1929 and 2008. And, yes, we also invented the stock exchange.
 
- By the later 1700s and 1800s much of the old glory had decayed into insignificance. Napoleon put his brother on the throne when he conquered The Netherlands.

- After the fall of the French Empire the country remained a monarchy, now under King Willem I, a descendant of William of Orange. This dynasty lasts until this day. In the 1830s Belgium and Luxemburg become independent.

- 1848 Prime Minister Thorbecke writes the Constitution, the monarch gives off most of his power to the wealthy elite and the country becomes a constitutional monarchy to prevent violent revolution like in France.

- In the later 1800s and early 1900s, a new wave of Dutch masters emerges with names like Vincent van Gogh, Piet Mondriaan and M.C. Escher.

- 1917: Women are allowed to vote, finalising the country as a full parliamentary democracy.

- In WW2 we are part of the Third Reich between 1940 and 1945. In this period, thirteen year-old Anne Frank writes one of the world's most influential books: Het Achterhuis, known in English as Dairy of a Young Girl. It is a first-hand account of what it was like for a Jewish teenage girl to hide for the nazis in her own home. The house in Amsterdam is now one of the country's most popular museums.

- After WW2 Indonesia becomes independent after a bloody war between colonial powers and the Indonesian natives. The natives are heavily oppressed by colonial forces but are supported by the Japanese eventually. The Japanese put colonists, Indonesians who are part of mixed families and people who supported the colonial rule in interments camps. After the independence, Sukarno became president of Indonesia. People from the Maluku strait, who want their own republic as promised by the Dutch government, never actually get their wishes fulfilled. Those who support the Southern Maluku Republic (RMS) are still persecuted in Indonesia today. Many of these people and their descendants still live in The Netherlands. They even have a president in exile and are important part of Dutch communities, especially in southern and western cities. Their spicy, rich cuisine becomes very popular throughout the 50s and 60s and is a revelation for the Dutch who are used to rather simple and bland types of food.

- The Netherlands, one of Europe's main WW2 battlefields, is rebuilt with the Marshal Aid. Willem Drees, the first socialist Prime Minister, sets up a pension system. A universal healthcare system is made. Phenomenal economic growth throughout the 50s. 

- After a flood in the southwest in 1953, killing thousands, the Delta Works are initiated. This is a series of dams and bridges that prevent the sea from flooding the below-sea level areas again. It also makes the connection between Zealand and Rotterdam, the world's leading sea port at the time, much easier.

- In the 1950s the first immigrants from (former) colonies such as Suriname, The Antilles and Indonesia (mostly the aforementioned Maluku) arrive. Others major groups include Spaniards, Moroccans and Turkish. The latter two bring Islam to The Netherlands. 

- Until well into the 1960s everyday life in The Netherlands is aligned along four so-called 'pillars'. These are the country's main political and religious groups. The four main groups are the catholics, protestants, socialists and liberals. Your religion or lack thereof, upbringing and social status generally define which of these you belong to. If you were a protestant, you didn't buy your groceries at a catholic-owned shop down the street. Instead you'd prefer to walk another mile to buy them at a protestant greengrocer. This emcompassed public TV and radio, newspapers, sports clubs, schools, political parties and many other things and it generally defined with which people you interacted and with which you didn't. Much of the contact between these groups happened at the leadership level. In parliament, provincial councils and city councils was were the leaders of these movements would meet and vote on policies, but that was mostly it. After the 1960s pillarisation died down with the rise of the counter culture. The public TV and Radio still kind of works like this, though. Every group who can show they represent an important group within Dutch society can apply for broadcasting time based on membership numbers, a system unique in the world. There still exist socialist, catholic etc. TV broadcasting stations.

- The 1970s and 1980s see a rise in leftist sentiment. Particularly young people show renewed interest in the works of Marx and the like. Socialist candidates do well in elections. In the late 70s Labour PM Joop den Uyl is very popular among voters. Suriname gains independence in that period. A conservative minister of health - of all people - partially legalizes pot. 

- Protests against nuclear energy and American warheads are commonplace in the 1980s. In 1980 Queen Beatrix is sworn in amidst protests against a lack of housing for young people. The 'lost generation' is a term heard often.

- By the 1990s and early 2000s, much of that sentiment has died down. A centrist government comes to power. For the first time in decades, only secular parties govern, allowing for the legalization of same-sex marriage, euthanasia and prostitution. The economy is booming and life is generally awesome.

- The 2000s mark the rise of right-wing populists. Pim Fortuyn, islam critic and leader of a new political movement, rises in the polls. His support comes largely in the wake of 9/11 and concerns about immigration. A few days before the 2002 elections, a leftist radical kills Fortuyn. His party goes from 0 to 26 seats in parliament and enters the coalition with liberals and christian democrats. The ministers and MPs are, however, incompetent and the cabinet collapses within a year. In 2004, another Islam critic, filmmaker Theo van Gogh is killed by a Muslim radical after making a short anti-islam film with liberal and feminist MP Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Hirsi Ali is still alive but now lives in the US. This fuels the rise of Geert Wilders, a member of Hirsi Ali's liberal party. He splits of and launches his own party, which is now a major political force. Much of what Fortuyn adressed is now being adressed by Wilders and his anti-Islam, anti-immigration and euroskeptic Freedom Party. The Dutch reject the draft of the European Constitution in 2005.

- In the 2010s the euroskeptic sentiment is still strong amidst the eurocrisis and aid to depth-burdened southern European countries. What this will lead to we will see.

In Latvia 1000 EUR per month is more than most people make, you'd do fine with that amount of money. Similar in Lithuania. In Estonia with its slightly higher standards you'd also be fine, the average salary in Estonia is 1000 EUR but before taxes. Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria and most of Ukraine would be cheaper. Most (perhaps all?) of the former Yugoslavia would also work.

Of course most of those cheap places are probably not where you want to live. This will also depend on what you want to do. Countries like Spain and Italy may be more fun to live in but they're still more expensive than the others I listed.

You may face the obstacle of visas and other immigration requirements. Staying for a year would not count as a short-term tourist stay, and some countries may in fact demand that you show a sufficient amount of funds.

You would first need a marriagability certificate (Ehefähigkeitszeugnis). As a foreigner, this probably needs filing with your embassy. I was lucky enough to live twenty minutes away from the US embassy, but still had to wait about a week for the appointment.

You will also need an original copy (oxymoron, I know) of your birth certificate sent over from the authorities in Canada. If your authorities are anything like the ones from my birth state, this will take about a month. Then you need the international recognition paperwork (Apostille). Then you need both to be officially translated. Time, time, and more time.

You'll need a language certificate as well, but I assume you already had one when you applied for your visa the first time.

Then you go to your local Standesamt. If yours is anything like the one in my neck of the woods, it will take around a month for them to review your paperwork. Not accept, but review. You may need additional documentation and/or a hearing where you must prove that the marriage is not solely for economic/immigration reasons. Being previously denied a visa and then rushing to get married may be a bit of a black mark.

If all of this works, you're at the mercy of whenever the Standesamt actually has marriage appointments.

It would also be mad foolish to do this without consulting a lawyer first for a prenup.

Of course all of this also costs money. My fiancé and I have shelled out a couple hundred euros now just on this paperwork.

We thought we'd be married by the middle of September. Our paperwork is still under review, but even if it got accepted *right now*, we wouldn't be able to book an appointment until November.

 Que les américains le fassent pour bien faire comprendre que quand les états-unis disent qu'il y a une ligne rouge, il ne faut pas la franchir, ça je comprends : ils ont la puissance militaire pour faire les frappes et accompagner le discours par l'action.

Mais la France ? La Syrie n'a pas d'intérêt stratégique majeur pour nous, en tout cas comparé à d'autres pays comme Israël, la Russie ou la Turquie. Les armes chimiques sont préoccupantes pour l'OTAN mais la Turquie et Israël ont les forces militaires pour neutraliser la Syrie si celle-ci les emploie à l'extérieur de ses frontières.

Est-ce que c'est juste pour le gain diplomatique d'affirmer que la France est à la pointe des dossiers diplomatiques internationaux ? Dans ce cas-là, c'est non seulement cynique (penser aux pauvres mecs qui se recoivent des missiles de croisières et qui n'ont attaqué aucun français) mais stupide : les rafales sont trop peu nombreux et les stocks de missile de croisière trop faibles pour avoir une véritable influence militaire comparé à la marine et aéronavale US qui peuvent lancer des tomahawks par paquets.

Ce dont je suis sûr, c'est que ce n'est pas pour faire plaisir aux industriels de l'armement. A 850 000 euros le missile SCALP, même si on en tirait une centaine, ça ferait moins de 100 millions d'euros, moins de 0,3% du budget annuel de la défense.

Non so chi voterei alle prossime elezioni. Ma la domanda dice: chi voterei **ORA**, quindi per capirci: niente Renzi, niente alleanze FI+lega, nessuna scissione del PDL, M5S semi-compatto senza piattaforma per le decisioni online, ecc... insomma **ORA**.

Ora probabilmente votereri per il M5S. Sia chiaro: il M5S non mi entusiasma per niente, vedo molti più limiti che potenzialità e il Grillo-pensiero mi irrita non poco.

Ma ecco perchè **ORA** sarebbe la mia scelta:

Ho sempre pensato che il programma di FARE fosse l'unico in grado di dare un'impatto positivo all'economia del paese. Sono ancora scottato dalla vicenda di Giannino, sono ora senza riferimenti e non sono soddisfatto di nessuna delle opzioni che mi rimangono (posso approfondire). 

Quindi penso che selezionerò 1-2 punti chiari che voglio dal prossimo governo. E credo: 1) riduzione della spesa pubblica + 2) riforme istituzionali (funzioni del senato, maggiore governabilità). Chiedo molto di più dal parlamento e dal governo, ma dato che questi non sono tempi in cui si può pretendere molto dalla politica, decido di fare una severa selezione di ciò che voglio e dimenticare tutto il resto.

A quel punto farò una lista ordinata dei partiti che (secondo soggettivissimi e mutevolissimi fattori) avranno più probabilità di portare a casa quei risultati.
Poi da queta lista cancello il partito che sta lì solo per salvare il culo a Berlusconi.

A quel punto voterò il primo partito di questa mia lista. Anche se fosse portavoce di valori incoliabili con i miei, se fosse uno zerovirgola party, se fosse un partito pirata o se frequenta cattive amicizie.

Non so chi sarà il vincitore di questa gara al momento delle elezioni, spero non il M5S.

Ma se si andasse alle urne domani, con questi criteri che mi sono dato, ahimè, voterei il M5S.

EDIT: e comunque in genere non do lo stesso voto alla Camera e al Senato. Se si andasse al voto con questa legge elettorale potrei comunque dare un voto diverso al senato.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"Actually, the likely abolition of the Irish upper house is a good example of where the naive view of democracy clashes with functional systems of democracy - its current state, on the other hand, is a good example of the difference between the theory and practice of the latter.

The upper house is not ""undemocratic"" except in the most naive conception of democracy (that is, one person one vote on everything as an absolute binary yardstick). It has a limited electorate, which if democracy is being observed, should mean a limited mandate - that is, it should have only weak powers. This is the case - the Seanad exists as a talking shop whose only legislative power is delay. They can propose amendments to legislation, but their proposals are voted on by the lower house.

What the Irish upper house is *supposed* to be is exactly what has been suggested here several times. They are supposed to represent specific important sectors of Irish society who might be supposed to have a technical input to legislation, and whose interests are most likely to be strongly impacted by the general run of legislation. So there is an Agriculture 'panel' to which 11 senators are elected, an 'Administrative' panel (representing the interests of the public service) to which 7 senators are elected, an 'Industry' panel to which 9 are elected and so on. The university panels exist to give a 'liberally educated' voice. The panels are supposed to be filled by experts in the relevant fields.

These panels, bar the university ones, are elected by MPs and county councillors - who have been elected in turn by the general public. So while the electorate is restricted, it is universal by proxy for the majority of senators. In fact, it is more universal than the electorate for the Taoiseach (prime minister) who is elected solely by the votes of the lower house, and who forms the government.

So in theory, the upper house consists of an expert scrutiny body with a balance of the major special interests in the country whose ability to debate, delay, and amend legislation from the lower house adds to the quality of Irish legislation. They have a limited electorate, thus a limited mandate, and so limited powers.

In practice, unfortunately, an electorate consisting of MPs and councillors results in the upper house being largely a parking place for failed politicians who then vote according to their party division in the lower house. This, along with the government's power to appoint 11 senators, makes the upper house generally a cipher, with the exception of one or two notable characters who slip through the net.

And it's unlikely to be abolished even on the basis that its legislative role  is superfluous, but on the spurious basis that it will save a bit of money - that's according to current public opinion research.

It may seem that a talking shop with a limited electorate has no real role to play in a democracy, but in fact a central and permanent talking shop is important, because it feeds the media, who in turn feed public opinion. The lower house should perform this role (under the Irish whip system, where every vote is guaranteed to go the government, it's the only role they play), but unfortunately the government also have the power in the lower house either to truncate debate by use of a 'guillotine', or to avoid it entirely by use of fiat legislation called Statutory Instruments, and recent governments have made increasingly heavy use of both these mechanisms to avoid debate in the lower house - probably 75% of Irish legislation goes through on one or other of these mechanisms. That's important, because the only real opposition to government action in Ireland comes not from the legislature but from informed public opinion - and it's hard for public opinion to be informed without debate.

So in fact what is happening is that on the basis of a spurious claim of saving money by the government, the Irish public will vote for being a little less informed in advance about government legislation, and democracy will be reduced a little bit. Not a lot, mind you, but we don't have a lot.

true,theothercoolfish,CZEC,Czech Republic,"&gt;Really? That's your attitude in 2013? Jewish Europeans are not foreigners or citizens of Israel. You have a funny mix of attitudes.

If they want to continue stone age behaviour, then they can go to a country that permits &amp; encourages stone age behaviour. I'm not a lawyer, but their Law of Return pretty much makes it easy peasy for them to get Israeli citizenship. As for Muslims who want to drag the stone age into Europe, I'm sure they could easily immigrate to some dirt hole that will happily accommodate them. I do have a funny mix of attitudes. I don't believe we should be bombing other countries, or forcing them to get in line with our cultural values, but that goes both ways - people who want to drag Europe down to their level can fuck right off. 

As for civil liberties - I don't believe parents have any liberty to harm their children, and there's absolutely no need to discuss the parents' religion and religious beliefs when a child's well being is at question. It's as simple as that, and all this hand waving is trying to be politically correct and not insult the religious. Fuck 'em. Health and wellbeing of the child is more important than their relationship with their imaginary friend(s).

The entrance hall however, was stuffy and dusty and made Fawlty Towers look outright modern.

Light was just about the only thing the very British windows *didn't* properly let through. There were no blinds or curtains to add any protection from wind and noise.

The water pressure in the shower was basically non existent. The pump mentioned in the blog article must not have been functioning and soaping up in the shower like usual simply wasn't an option at roughly five drops per second - it would have taken half an hour to rinse the soap off again. Showering was all about guiding what little water there was into the more important key areas.

A mon sens, ce n'est pas vraiment l'utilisation à l’extérieur des frontières qui inquiétait tout le monde.

Si la guerre civile Syrienne était restée ce qu'elle était, c'est à dire un échange de balles, missiles et autres joyeusetés entre le gouvernement et les rebelles, personne n'aurait fait valoir un droit d'ingérence dans le conflit. L'OTAN et l'ONU auraient continué à menacer, infligé des amendes etc... autant dire, continué à pisser dans un violon parce qu'ils n'ont aucun pouvoir concret sur un territoire souverain.

A partir du moment ou, en Syrie, il y a eu utilisation d'armes chimiques (remarque que je ne me positionne pas sur le camp qui en a fait usage), tout le monde a interprété ce geste comme un point de non-retour où un camp ne tentait même plus d'épargner les populations civiles pour arriver à ses fins. Parce que les armes chimiques sont certes efficaces mais pour une bonne partie incontrôlables, les USA et la France ont jugé qu'il était temps qu'ils s'en mêlent (à tort ou à raison, chacun son opinion).

So it quickly became very rich. (not that your average worker would have felt that.)

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"One way of looking at democracy which doesn't seem to have come up here is in terms of the formal relations between the parts of a constitutional architecture - where democracy, in practice, boils down to accountability of the executive and legislature to the people.

What needs to be done to run a modern state? Laws must be made, laws must be applied, public services must be funded and run, decisions must be made about the use of resources at levels from the strategic to the detailed, relations with other states must be managed, problems must be tackled, and so on. And someone must do these various things.

A fundamental assumption underlying the constitutional architecture of a democratic state is that left to their own devices, the people who do these things will entrench themselves and their preferred heirs in their positions, and use these positions to their own advantage, avoiding the detriment of the general public only to the extent necessary to avoid revolution. They will become an aristocracy, and the state an oligarchy - and probably from time to time a tyranny of some kind when one strong individual captures the levers of the state.

Democratic states therefore have a set of checks and balances, particularly separations of powers, which seem designed to be awkward - as indeed they are, because they are intended partly to slow down the process of government to allow the people to influence it.

The most fundamental set of checks to oligarchy in a democratic state is the right of the people to decide questions of policy directly themselves, or to decide who will decide them on their behalf. Without this right, a state cannot be democratic.

The second most fundamental level is the separation of powers. This means that the laws are created by a body representing the people (the legislature), not by the sitting government (the executive), and applied by judges (the judiciary) who are independent of the sitting government.

In theory, then, the executive proposes laws, the legislature creates laws, and the judiciary applies laws. The executive also makes all the day to day decisions (in detail via a permanent civil service) - but the important thing is that they can only do so within the framework of law created and applied independently of them.

So, while we can elect an executive - directly or indirectly - and do so on the basis of their proposed set of policies, once they are elected they should automatically, as part of the ordinary workings of a democratic state, be *presumed* to be likely to be working for their own interests rather than those of the public. That is why they are to be corralled by laws not made or applied by them, because they are automatically under suspicion. That is also why the legislature, as directly elected by people, have the right to unseat a sitting executive through motions of recall or non-confidence.

It should be obvious from that that it doesn't actually matter much whether you elect an executive directly, or indirectly, or just appoint people (technocratic government), because the mechanism by which the executive is held accountable - the judiciary and the legislature - remain the same in every case, and the suspicion with which they should be treated should also be the same in every case. There's actually quite a good argument for technocratic government, which is that members of the executive then have no mandate independent of the legislature, and therefore can't ever argue that they are themselves as representative as the legislature.

Unfortunately, party politics seem to be an inevitable result of being human, and are very damaging to the separation between the legislature and the executive. What tends to happen, as we all know, is that executives are formed usually by members of a particular party with a majority of the seats in the legislature. That then means that the executive has a built-in majority in the legislature, and depending on the extent of the freedom given to individual legislators by their party in voting, may well have a guaranteed rubber stamp and no possibility of recall. In the Irish system, for example, every vote, no matter how trivial, requires government party members to vote as they're told or face expulsion from the party - the result of which is that the Irish government never ever loses votes in the legislature, and can govern unchecked except for the basic law in the Constitution.

So real democratic systems are built around the notions that the people will not want to make all the decisions, that someone must do so, and that the someone who does so must be considered suspect and held accountable to the people directly and/or to their elected representatives. The various checks and balances required to make this work against the fact that the executive actually have their hands on the levers of power require constant and vigilant defence because they are always amenable to erosion in the name of efficiency, party loyalty, or cost cutting - but it is rarely a good idea to give any of them up.",0,1380553512,null,0,false,0,cci7d43,t3_1nddy2,t1_cci7d43,t3_1nddy2,null,1429294172,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

2. A lack of shared political culture. This one is much harder than just fixing the structures. In the UK at least MEPs are not picked on anything approaching a wider EU view of the picture. It is either a protest vote against the EU or a protest vote against the British government. Nobody votes on actual EU policy (not helped by the fact the EU Parliament is a giant social club) but on largely internal facing issues. In a wider sense it isn't helped by the fact I don't know what the French or German parties are saying about Europe. There isn't really a political landscape in which myself and a Frenchmen are picking candidates from the same cloth. We are picking French and British candidates that are loosely affiliated if at all.

Exactly, that is why a lot of us, in Europe, has decided we need a court that is *above* that, just because we do not have faith in our own courts. 

&gt;Of course governments should say no to stuff they don’t approve of. Everybody should say no to stuff they don’t approve of.

Not if it concerns *Human Rights*. Seriously, is it so impossible for you to imagine (or, in fact, just look at the facts) that sometimes the government ignores Human Rights? Are you saying that they never ever do that, so you want to give them all power, forever and ever, amen? What is wrong with having a higher court who tells them no, *when it comes to human rights*. 

&gt; I happen to believe that all humans have rights, and that courts aren't always looking out for them, not at all. 


Well, that is what *the Court of Humans rights do""*. They look out for the humans, even when the government doesn't. You however, are arguing for two things at once, that contradict each other.First, you want human rights, but you do not want a watch dog, you claim that every government does it better without signing a paper or belonging to the ECHR. Btw, do you have proof of that statement? 


&gt;Why is it that you have so little faith in democracy that you consider it suspect that elected representatives are better holders of power than unelected bureaucrats?

Becaue they are judges whos only goal is to protect *our human rights*. How can anybody be as naive as you. So, Berlusconis goal is to protect our human rights? Go to the ECHR and see - every government has been convicted. Apparently your plan isn't working, all the governments aren't looking out the whole time for peoples human rights. You must be beyond naive (and ignoring facts) if you believe tht. That is why we have an extra watchdog, whos only goal is to protect us, our human rights.

after that we had no work, no business and lost everything and were literally poor, nobody wanted to help us and the case was thrown out when we tried to counter sue the government, i was wearing my cousins used clothes and had to eat food donated from my aunts and uncles, 10 years later when the law finally did come out we asked for a permit and they said we could have one but it would cost us, they were un-able to give us a cost because they don't use computers as of yet, they still had phones and faxes (in 2004) so we applied and they said they will let us know, failure to let us know the cost within the first 6 months would result in us paying ZERO euros, which was great, 6 months, then 1 year, then 2 and finally after 3 years we get a bill in the mail for 380,000 euros from the italian government, it was issued shortly after we asked for it, but was never sent, even after we called multiple times during the first 6 months they said they still didn't know, and the bill was issued from the office 2 doors over.  

Me my mother and father went to rome to speak to the head of the department of communications and i had to literally beg him to fix the thing, and explained it to him, seeing as the company was in my name i told him i did not have this money as we barely made enough because it was not the same as the years prior, he looked at me and said ""well you know, i have a son so i can understand your problem, i'll make a few phone calls and have it removed"" and we went downstairs and redid the license correctly and he told us the cost on the spot and it was 3000 euros a year which was better.

after all that mess, we worked for a while till we ran into different issues and were forced to sell the company, my father is over 60 and i didn't feel like climbing on roofs anymore, i know live in Austria and make very good money from a desk job in a internet company.


I have a million more stories about how the italian government is run by a bunch of Aholes who get money under the table from the Camorra and the mafia to pass laws to screw up the whole country.

Y en a plein. Cercle d'influence culturels, diplomatiques, militaires... quel que soit la manière dont tu regardes les choses, la Syrie est à la limite de ce cercle d'influence. La lybie était bien plus à l'intérieur dans le cercle militaire et le liban est bien plus dans le cercle diplomatique.

Bof. La Syrie et la france n'ont jamais été copains comme cochon et à moins de se bercer d'illusions, les acteurs locaux comme Israël, l'iran, la Russie (bah oui, le caucase, c'est tout près) et la Turquie, etc... pèseront toujours plus lourd.

Quant à ton raisonnement sur les matières premières, il est loin de faire l'unanimité en géo-politique. L'argument économique a été mis à mal après que le japon a montré qu'on pouvait réussir sans ressources après une guerre désastreuse pour en acquérir et l'argument stratégique, notamment pour le pétrole, est discutable.

British is a self-identifier anyone in this country who identifies with Britain *on any level* is likely to use. 'British' isn't the same as English or Scottish in that it's much easier to 'become British', which is largely a political and cultural idea, than to 'become English' or 'become Scottish', which runs deeper.

Cioè, mi pare quasi che ti aspetti che sia il vegano a doverti informare di tutte le altre cose che si possono fare per migliorare il mondo, ma quella è una tua responsabilità, trovare una ""tattica"" in cui credi, mica del vegano che per una bizzarra distorsione del concetto di onestà intellettuale o deve essere l'enciclopedia vivente della sostenibilità ambientale o è il fighetto con l'iphone.

Boh non so, queste cose esistono da secoli, letteralmente: quando erano in pochi a saper leggere e scrivere, già circolavano teorie complottiste.

Con l'aumentare dell'alfabetizzazione e della diffusione della stampa e poi di Internet, queste teorie hanno visto un'esplosione e hanno raggiunto un numero di persone che prima era, per forza di cose, necessariamente molto più ristretto.

Une fois que tu as acquis un niveau de base, tu n'as plus besoin qu'on te parle en français durant le cours.

Durant le cours tu essaies d'être le plus en immersion possible. Ça travaille ton oreille, et tu dois aussi faire l'effort de ne parler que la langue du cours. C'est dur mais c'est un minimum. C'est l'exercice même.   

Le prof doit trouver un moyen de t'expliquer en utilisant des mots simples, des dessins, des mimes, etc... Il faut carrément écarter la traduction simple parce qu'on risque de faire des traductions de phrases plus tard et non plus des phrases conçues directement dans la langue apprise.

true,Turminder_Xuss,,Schleswig-Holstein,"Actually, German R is closer to French R then Spanish R IMHO. The Spanish R sound (barring regional dialects) is made very close to the front of your mouth. The French R sound as in ""incroyable"" is much more back. Actually, it's pretty close to the German.

As the video explains, there are two cases of ""R"", however. In front of a syllable, like in ""radio"", you make this gargling sound. It's made almost at the same spot a (accent-free) Spanish ""j"" would be made. Just a little bit more back, and not hissing, but gargling. The other case, like in ""morgen"", or ""Germany"", has a bit more regional variety. In northern Germany, the R is not really pronounced, but replaced with sort of an ""A"" sound. Think of very broad American pronunciation of ""Germany"". The video speaker definitely has northern accent. Standard pronunciation would spell the R a bit more, and you definitely hear almost no difference between ""morgen"" and ""radio"" in many parts of Germany. 

The northern way of not pronouncing the R has made some funny things happen in my life btw, and it has made learning Spanish a daring endeavor. :)

I mainly stick to the variety of where I grew up (Slesvig-Holstein, R almost nonexistent). In rare cases I use the pronounced R, for example in an overly formal greeting of people I see all the time (""Einen wunderschönen guten Mo*r*gen, Herr Bürokollege""), just for shits and giggles.

Generally, pronunciation of the R does not matter. You can tell the approximate geographic region the speakers hails from, if you want. Very ""rolling"" R (think Rammstein music) is oftentimes associated with nazis or Hitler. People sometimes use it mockingly to poke fun at overly nationalistic people. Also immigrants of Russian descent are known for a very pronounced R.

The way I read it, the report explains that in other countries the relationship between shools and LGBT associations is much stronger than in france (for reasons they explain) and it advocates the need for a better collaboration between the two. BUT it's not clear to me that they want ONLY lgbt associations to be allowed to teach these classes to pupils: they explain that these asssociations need more money in order to be able to have enough people qualified to train the schools' staff. The report also lists a lot of ideas to help teachers and other people in the hierarchy of schools become aware of these issues and include them in the curriculum (in various ways), but concerning who should teach these ""sexuality"" courses is not really clear to me. (They state that the associations receive a lot of requests to intervene but I'm not sure they mean in front of all pupils, from the elementary to the secondary level). It seems that they want the associations to intervene mostly in the ESPEs (universities where future teachers are trained (former ""IUFMs"")).


I would also like to point out this important paragraph:
&gt; **Adapter les problématiques traitées et les ressources à l’âge des élèves**

&gt;• Accorder une priorité à la prévention en collège : chez les jeunes LGBT, la prise de conscience de sa différence et la découverte de son homosexualité se font principalement pendant la période de scolarisation au collège. C’est le moment d’une grande fragilisation de ces jeunes. C’est pendant cette période qu’ils ont besoin d’une école inclusive.

&gt;• Ces actions devront se poursuivre bien évidemment au niveau du lycée.

&gt;• En primaire, c’est au travers notamment de la diversité des familles, de l’homoparentalité, du refus des insultes et des discriminations que le sujet peut être abordé.


= They explain that these classes should, of course, be adapted to the age of the kids: focus on the ""collèges"" (ages 11-15) when teenagers who may become aware of their ""differences"" need to feel particularly included by their school. They say that the youngest ones (ages 6 to 10) should be told about the diversities of family types, including homoparental ones, and about discriminations... So, of course, it's in no way about teaching young kids about sex :) (Anyway at this age they are in their latency stage which means their development doesn't allow them to understand all these things.)

Actually, without being as negative as u/erdie, your problem will not be your tatoos but finding a job. 
But what kind of job are you thinking of, precisely ? If it´s barmaid or something like that to cover your future studies costs it´ll be even welcomed. If it's a corporate, executive kind of job in a few years, after your master, it´ll frowned upon and better hidden from view when doing interviews. 

Now something off topic : you being a former marine. That'll elicit an almost automatic positive view in the US (according to what I read on reddit). But mostly the opposite in France. If you mention Irak you'll probably get neverending arguments with people thinking it´s a war without a cause. And if the subject of Guantanamo arises I know that personally i'm mad at the US, at Obama, at the US government in general, and at the american citizen (for their lack of reaction to this situation).

true,sayheykid24,UNSA,United States of America,"Here's the piece cut and pasted: 

Europe’s political leaders have seized on the first uptick in European economic indicators as evidence that their policies are working. Who would have thought that?

Eurozone gross domestic product expanded 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of this year. It will probably have expanded again in the third quarter. So if you define the end of a recession as two consecutive quarters of positive growth, you might be tempted to forecast that the recession will end at precisely midnight on Monday with the end of the quarter. If you do this, you are either a fool or someone with an agenda to peddle – or both.

A recession is a broad-based downturn in economic activity. The focus on two consecutive quarters of GDP is at best a shorthand back-of-the-envelope indicator for a normal business cycle. But this is not a normal business cycle. Just look at the order of magnitudes involved. Comparing the first half of 2007 and the first half of 2013, real GDP contracted by an accumulated 1.3 per cent in the eurozone, 5.3 per cent in Spain and 8.4 per cent in Italy.

In the same period investment was down by an accumulated 19 per cent in the eurozone – and 38 per cent in Spain and 27 per cent in Italy. Between the first quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2013, employment fell 17 per cent in Spain and 2 per cent in Italy. I would not call the end of the recession until we see a sustained improvement in growth and employment. Once the recession ends, I would expect that we will get back to the pre-recession trendline.

The biggest drag on eurozone growth right now is Italy. The coalition of Enrico Letta, the Italian prime minister, has effectively collapsed over the weekend as Silvio Berlusconi has withdrawn his ministers. The latest political turmoil will prolong the recession as the uncertainty holds back investment.

Even a new government will not bring a solution. Italy is stuck with a combination of an unsustainable high level of public debt and no productivity growth. It has essentially two options to adjust – become like Germany, or leave the eurozone. The country is unable to do the first, and unwilling to do the latter. As the economists Francesco Giavazzi and Alberto Alesina calculated in an article in Corriere della Sera last week, it would cost some €50bn to reduce the tax wedge – the difference between labour costs and net income – to German levels. There is simply no political majority in sight for such radicalism. The centre-right prioritises tax cuts on consumption and housing, while Mr Letta’s Partito Democratico vetoes spending cuts. Italy faces no immediate threat for as long interest rates remain low. The country will be able to muddle through for a while until some political or economic shock will force a decision one way or the other.

Meanwhile, the single largest constraint on the resumption of eurozone growth is not fiscal policy – which is broadly neutral at present across the single currency area – but the continued failure to clean up the banks. The growth rate of loans to the non-financial sector turned negative in 2009, showed some intermittent improvements, only to then deteriorate again last year. Things have not improved since: in August this year loans to the private sector were down 2 per cent over the past year. M3, a broad measure of money in circulation, grew by an annual rate of just 2.3 per cent in the June to August period.

The monetary and banking data are telling us that the economy will teeter on the brink of zero or low growth for the foreseeable future because the financial sector is not supplying the economy with sufficient funds to expand.

Banking union could help, but only if it were to break the relationship between banks and sovereigns and clean up the balance sheets. Yet neither is going to happen. I believe Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is serious in his determination to produce a clean and honest asset quality review, which will start next month. He certainly does not want to repeat the mistakes of the European Banking Authority, which has lost its credibility with farcical stress tests.

But what can he do if governments fail to agree a fiscal backstop for this exercise? Would it not be irresponsible to admit that banks need several hundred billion euros in new capital when that money is simply not there? But without a clean-up of the banking sector, I see no trend change in the monetary and bank lending indicators – and this will postpone the recovery further.

The most positive news we have had in the eurozone has been the growth of Spanish exports, which have risen 11 per cent in real terms from the first half of 2008 to the first half of this year. The improvement of Spanish export competitiveness is substantive, but mostly as a result of cuts in employment rather than wages. It is not clear to me whether an export-led growth strategy of the kind pursued by Germany would be feasible and sustainable for Spain.

Italy’s political and economic implosion, the credit crunch and past austerity are among the main factors weighing on the eurozone today. The recession that started in 2008 continues, once you ditch the silly obsession with two consecutive quarters.

So, American rights are easily negotiated, given that most of the actors live in the same country and all share a culture of, well, mass-culture marketing.

I would have *expected* the AfD to suck up a lot of the NPD vote. And my state-by-state chart shows them scoring best in the same states: Sachsen, Brandenburg and Thuringen.

But it doesn't appear to have happened. I mean, the AfD surged into a near-5% score (which to German standards is quite a breakthrough), and the NPD lost ... almost nothing. It went from 1.5% to 1.3%.

Exit poll data [about voter flows](http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2013-09/Wahlergebnisse-Bundestagswahl-CDU-Merkel) confirms that ex-NPD voters seem to have made up only a small part of the AfD vote. ""Other parties"", a catch-all category which includes the Pirates, the NPD and all the smallest parties, together lost some 410.000 voters to the AfD - but the AfD got 2.060.000, so that's just 1 in 5 AfD voters.

Ripeto: al PD l'accordo con il PDL andava bene perché almeno sapevano cosa aspettarsi. Il M5S inizialmente non ha dato prova di grande affidabilità (e non aiuta il fatto di non avere interlocutori diretti che non vengano smentiti quotidianamente da Messora o Grillo), quindi dopo il primo tentativo, fatto con buona volontà ma poche speranze, e sostanzialmente per non scontentare la base, hanno lasciato perdere.

In ogni caso, una volta formato il governo Berlusconi tiene tutti per le palle, al minimo sospiro minaccia di far cadere il governo. Ma il PD sa che prima o poi si stuferà comunque, magari alla prima bega giudiziaria, così come ha fatto con Monti. Il PD si è opposto al Mattarellum per una questione di opportunità: quando cadrà il governo, prima che vengano sciolte le camere il governo andrà avanti un mese o due sull'ordinaria amministrazione, e ci sarà il tempo di fare tutto quel che si vuole sulla legge elettorale, essendo stato nel frattempo il Porcellum bocciato dalla Corte Costituzionale. E magari finire le ultime letture del dimezzamento dei parlamentari per lanciare la campagna elettorale (i tempi sono stretti, per questo si è cambiato l'art 138) con l'appoggio del M5S che a questo punto non può dir di no,

true,erdle,null,null,"""without being as negative as u/erdie"" - IF the French economy grows in 2014, it will be the first time in 3 years. The French economy has experienced negative growth since OP was in the Navy. And the Finance minister is just delusional. And the European Commission has hit them on the hand and is continuing to do so until they trim their budget deficit. 

I love to travel, Paris is great, I've lived there. But you should also be real with someone that is young and clearly planning the next few years (if not more) of their life around Paris and France. 

Do you want to be real about the future of France? How many native French speakers are there in the world? A littler over 1% of the world speaks French. There are more than twice as many native Russian speakers than French speakers. Look at where other economies are growing and find the comparable companies in France. Did the Chinese just include French search engines, social networks, and apps in their new free trade zone? How many French car companies are developing autonomous vehicles? How many French ISPs are trying to snap up the Verizons of the world? 

With the exception of luxury goods, the whole country peaked in the 19th century and it's been a museum ever since.
