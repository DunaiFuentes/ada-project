As far as tradition goes, the traditional red meat products are mostly based on pork, and those are the kind of meat products that would be salted heavily. The trend may be going down, but tradition is strong. They do tell us that meat is bad (meat in general, these days, not just red meat, even though poultry does have a ""more healthy"" image) but most people will only make these kinds of changes slowly.

I found [this FAO data](http://de.scribd.com/doc/91840616/Meat-Consumption-Per-Person):

As you can see, it's *only* pork that Germans eat more of among the identifiable red meats in this data.

Et au passage, il fut un temps où l'on respectait les vieux, pour leur sagesse et leur expérience, au lieu de les traiter de réactionnaires en discréditant d'office leurs conseils (c'est mon cas, mes grands-parents avaient tellement vécu de choses que cela imposait le respect : guerre et prison, torture, occupation, résistance, décolonisation, ... jusqu'à la démocratisation d'internet). J'ai l'humilité de penser qu'ils en savent plus que moi, les très vieux (la génération 68 de mes parents, j'attends plutôt qu'elle s'excuse).

&gt;Pas de sexe hors mariage? Pas de sexe avant X rdv? Que proposes tu concrètement?

Non, ça c'est réactionnaire. On a maintenant des moyens de contraception et de protection qui permettent de ne plus se mettre en danger quand on couche avec quelqu'un.

Concrètement, ce que je propose, c'est la maîtrise de son corps et la responsabilité. Dire également qu'on n'est pas obligé d'être triste sans sexe. Le vrai bonheur, ce n'est pas de coucher avec quelqu'un dès qu'on en a envie, c'est d'arriver à maîtriser ses envies, et de le faire quand on veut vraiment et que l'autre aussi, pas quand notre corps nous l'impose.

Proposer une nouvelle morale qui ne serait plus fondée sur la domination de la femme mais lutte contre l'idéologie hédoniste de la vaine jouissance.

Sinon, complètement d'accord avec toi :

&gt;la possibilité de choisir d'avoir une relation sexuelle, de choisir son partenaire, de choisir sa contraception (surtout pour les femmes)... Pour moi c'est un progrès quand même :)

Mais pour moi, la libération sexuelle comporte également une culture le jeunesse, avec le fameux slogan ""il est interdit d'interdire"" qui tend à opposer toute forme de jugement sur la sexualité (y compris des pratiques SM, scato, zoophile etc. que je trouve moralement condamnables). Et finalement, tu l'as souligné, le passage du sexuel du privé au public avec une marchandisation de tout et un appel aux instincts et aux pulsions au lieu d'appeler à la raison.

That I agree with - although given the power of the German states, you have to remember that there are state and local institutions too - this is about national representation which, fairly understandably requires some level of national approval.

The Pirates are a good example of that, they have elected representatives all over the country, but they don't seem to have managed to inspire the confidence needed at the national level - That should be a spur to work harder and improve both their image and organisation, but they do represent people in serious bodies, doing serious jobs across the country..  

See what I like about the German system is that it is a bit of both, in the UK you need to win enough seats for a majority in parliament, by taking rather a lot of constituency seats (each with around 90,000 voters in them, give or take) via FPTP - that means you could come a close second in every single parliamentary constituency, or poll a consistent 20% across the whole country and end up with no seats at all.  Like I said, I think the German system balances it to a certain degree (not perfectly..) in that you have both party candidates and individuals with a geographic link - it seems to work.

That I agree with, large parties are better organised, funded and more able to compete simply because they have the infrastructure and experience.  However there is a huge difference between running a well supported local election campaign (which in germany can mean a whole host of different things) and a national one.

Being in Belgium gives you the opportunity to experiment with many different beers, so it is hard to pick. Hell, i might even drink a kriek (cherry beer) when the weather is good. 

If I then need to pick it would be Karmeliet: A strong beer which is usually  best enjoyed around friends.

true,FrankOBall,tourist,,"I will tend to exclude the ethymology related to Ionian Sea, because I don't find it likely at all that the second dyphthong ""io"" in ""Ionio"" would have become ""o"", resulting with the doubling of the ""n"". As far as I know, this phenomenon never occurred phonologically. Also, there are surnames tied to towns, but I've personally never heard sea-related family names.

Since some of the surnames listed in /u/simoneb_'s link are ""Di Ionno"", it makes me think that it was a first name, because in Abruzzi/Molise regions (where Campobasso is), surnames with ""Di + [first name]"" such as ""Di Pietro"", ""Di Gregorio"", ""Di Francesco"", ecc. are extremely common.

In fact, they are typical of that area.

The alternative solution would be that it's a toponym, which could also explain both the forms with and without ""Di"", but I couldn't find any town or place with that name.

So, I'm pretty sure that Ionno is/was a rather uncommon male name.

Now the speculations about its possible meaning. It might come from Iano (Janus), but it's very likely I'm wrong about that.

I'm 99% sure that it was a male name, though, for the reasons I explained before.

true,Misato-san,HUNG,Hungary,"**Hungary**

The 80's was politically a very colorful period in Hungary (like in most countries east of the Iron Curtain, I guess), and this diversity shows strongly in culture, even in pop music. The Socialist Party had the means to exercise censorship for most of the decade, but they had a policy to let some Western influence in and a little bit of system critique go through, to ""release some steam"".
So we had bands ranging from strongly supported by the Party to completely banned, and many varieties in between.

One of the most popular groups was founded by a guy whose parents fled Hungary in 1956, emigrated to the US, the guy (Miklós Fenyő) grew up there and at the end of the 60's came back to Hungary to ""teach a country how to rock 'n' roll"". They were immensely popular, and since they refrained form politics they could perform freely, as far as I know. This is them from 1981:

[Hungária - Hotel Menthol](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjBefVAKmIM)

They had offshoots trying to follow in their footsteps:

[Neoton Família - 220 felett (1982)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sBj6Aqytac)

[R-Go: Szeretlek is meg nem is (1985)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH9HTEQ7Te4)

There were bands that engaged in some form of criticism of the system, mostly between the lines, and could perform because they were a controlled way of expressing dissent:

[Illés - Nemzeti dal (1981)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXKWeYyY3cg)

[Hobo Blues Band - Vadászat (1984)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VmGQmPlIDg)

[Beatrice - Azok a boldog szép napok (1987)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQPiP-Kbk)

And there were the ones, the ""counter-culture"", that pretty much had to go underground for most of the decade, and their music spread through cassettes copied at private locations.

[Balaton - Ott torony volt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhZ9ie8HY2w)

true,ajehals,null,null,"&gt;But the problem with the German system is not that it can be biased against minorities it can be biased against majorities as well. 

But that is inherent in the system when you try to build balance into a democratic system.  It will skew things (slightly) in both direction. If you think about it, if you do get 5% of the vote in Germany, you are comparably well represented, whilst as you say, a majority party may well find that it is less well represented than you would guess from the votes.. It isn't unfair or undemocratic though.

&gt;For you to say whether a system is democratic or not means that you must have a definition of democracy. What is it?

Essentially my definition is Government by the people, either through representatives of directly.  - I wouldn't go any tighter than that - I would argue that within that there can be undemocratic action (who can vote is important, the cost to stand, the banning of parties etc..) but broadly speaking it is any system where the people have the responsibility for choosing who governs, and those who govern have to make a case to the people..

&gt;The one I am using is that a body is democratic to the extent that, for any proposition P, the proportion of elected members who support P will be the same as the proportion of voters who voted for candidates/parties/lists that supported P

So.. your definition of democracy is any perfect PR system? And only where the whole assembly is elected with a full national ballot? I assume you can see the problem with that in a federal system, or indeed any system where you might feel a geographic link is important?

This isn't a numbers game, it is about representation.  There are better ways and worse ways of running elections, depending on the outcome you seek, I think its rather hard to argue that there shouldn't be a bar for parties to cross if they lack strong support in any one area and have fairly diffuse support nationally - it should mean that they work to consolidate support (and there is funding for political parties in Germany, so that makes it a little easier) but this shouldn't be about ensuring that every party with 0.5% gets a seat in a national parliament..

When it came to personal liberties, other parties tried to fill the void, like the Pirates. Even the Greens were more progressive and liberal in many areas than the Liberals.

First there's a matter of principle. If half a percent of people vote for a certain party, then it seems only just to have half a percent of representatives from that party.

Second the political practice in Germany (and probably many other countries) is in conflict with the original idea of how a parliament should work. That idea IMHO is that many people from different parties get elected by different people representing a multitude of ideas and ideals and they work hard to find solutions that are good enough for everybody.

Now the reality is that a big part of the population is ignored and essentially a minority from only two or three parties forms a coalition, decides behind closed doors what is the right decision and use their time in parliament not actually debating and trying to convince others of their position, they give speeches which sound good to the stupid voters.

We are essentially cut off from the process of democracy.

Now having more smaller parties in parliament would make it a lot harder to find a coalition with close enough political positions to cheat us out of democracy. It would lead to either coalitions with more parties, that would probably lead to more open fights or it would lead to minority governments that would have to fight for support for every idea they have, which IMHO is how a democracy should work.

People will always look for ways to make their jobs easier, but that doesn't mean we should be okay with that and allow laws that are only made to make life for politicians easier even if that removes us more from the ideal of democracy.

Everybody can feel free to disagree with me on this. It's just my personal view of how I think democracy should work and what I think would improve the situation.

You essentially get to express something like the following with your ballot: ""in case my preferred candidate doesn't win, the next best alternative also has my support. The following others are sort of ok as well, except those last three."" (In the Schulze system, not ranking a candidate at all reflects a strong rejection of them.)

true,cabalamat,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt; if you do get 5% of the vote in Germany, you are comparably well represented, 

Indeed.

&gt; whilst as you say, a majority party may well find that it is less well represented than you would guess from the votes.. It isn't unfair or undemocratic though.

In the German system, a party getting &gt;50% of the votes will get &gt;50% of the seats.

&gt; So.. your definition of democracy is any perfect PR system? And only where the whole assembly is elected with a full national ballot? I assume you can see the problem with that in a federal system, or indeed any system where you might feel a geographic link is important?

In any system where each delegate has the same weight of votes, then there is an inherent granularity in the system, since representation comes in quanta (in German's case, 1/598ths) of the total. In the German system if they want a hurdle, it wouldn't particularly bother me if they elected the Bundestag by each Land separately; there are 16 Laender so each would elect on average 37 delegates, giving an implied hurdle of 2.6% which is a good deal less onerous than 5%. Or they could go the Norwegian route and have regional lists and then a national top-up as well.

&gt; I think its rather hard to argue that there shouldn't be a bar for parties to cross if they lack strong support in any one area and have fairly diffuse support nationally - it should mean that they work to consolidate support (and there is funding for political parties in Germany, so that makes it a little easier) but this shouldn't be about ensuring that every party with 0.5% gets a seat in a national parliament.. 

0.5% would be 220,000 votes. If all these people lived close together, they would get represented because they'd win a constituency seat. But if they are spread out, why should they be denied representation because of that? 

Part of the reason parliaments are elected by geographical area is administrative convenience, but part is because people who live in the same area can be presumed to have something in common. So e.g. people in Berlin probably care more about the Berlin S-Bahn than people outside Berlin do. 

But people who all vote the same way have probably got more in common, in terms of their beliefs and values, than people who merely happen to live near each other. If the German state said to a city of 220,000 votes (ie. 400,000 people) that they should get no representation, it would create a massive shitstorm, so shouldn't the same principle apply *a fortiori* to 220,000 people who vote the same way?

The Bundestag has 598 members (actually more because of overhangs) so shouldn't it try to represent 598 points of view? if the answer is ""no"" and the seats are handed out disproportionately to the big parties using a closed list, then is it electing people with an independent mind or merely sycophantic yes-men who suck up to the party leadership?",0,1379928223,null,0,false,0,ccdpjlg,t3_1mw9q6,t1_ccdpjlg,t1_ccdp6fw,null,1429371951,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm not a native, but I have sampled a fair few of the commercially available beers.


Most popular: Probably 1664, which is a pretty damned generic lager. However, you can usually get Pelforth on tap, which is somewhat better to my mind.



The best: My favourite genuine actual French beer is [La Goudale](http://beerpal.com/La-Goudale-Beer/11696/) - which is from the bit of France that's been swapped back and forth with Germany half a dozen times in the last few centuries, which is probably why it's the main beer producing region in the country. *(Edit: No, it's not, as Stemp kindly pointed out - but it is from near Belgium, so that explains why it's so good.)*  
However, there's not much incentive to go hunting for good French beer when there's so much really nice Belgian beer readily available. Leffe, Hoegaarden, Affligem, etc are all sold in the supermarkets here, and the French attitude seems to be ""Let the northeners worry about making beer, we'll concentrate on the wine.""  
I have tried a few French micro-brewery beers, and they've generally been pretty unremarkable.

No. You'd have to add up the percentages from the parties that did not get in the bundestag because they did not get at least 5%. These parties are AFD, FDP and Piraten.

AFD and FDP are more right while Piraten is left. 

AFD 4,7%

FDP 4,8%

Piraten 2,2%

Conclusion:

Conservative/right: 

CDU/CSU 41,5%

FDP 4,8%

AFD 4,7%

= 51%

SPD 25,7%

Grüne 8,4%

Linke 8,6%

Piraten 2,2%

= 44,9%

So the majority of germans voted conservative. But the Bundestag will not represent this because of the 5% threshold. Seats in the Bundestag do not reflect what the majority voted for. Left parties got the majority of seats, I don't deny this, but they did not get the majority of votes.

For the **UK** as a whole, **most popular** would be have to be Carling or Carlsberg probably, it's unfortunate because it's basically watered down piss lager.

For the **UK** as well, **the best** for me would have to be a good real ale; anything from the Wychwood Brewery like Hobgoblin or Wychcraft is lovely stuff, they have a fine selection of different types and you can get multipacks with their most popular ales from any decent supermarket.

For **Wales** though, the **most popular** is probably still the same as the UK as a whole, but in my region people are pretty fond of Wrexham Lager, which can only really be found in a few small pubs across Wales. It goes for about the same price as your standard lager (as low as £2.30 a pint, as much as £2.90) but tastes so much smoother. Before they introduced that at my local it was either Heineken or Fosters for me, after trying Wrexham I can't really go back.

For **Wales** as well, **the best** definitely has to be The Rev. James, get it on draught rather than from a bottle and you'll be hard pressed to find an ale that goes down better. It's also pretty accessible across the whole of the UK, but you're more likely to find it in pubs in the mid-south Wales area.

So che può sembrare polemico, ma non lo sono.

Non riesco a vedere l'ateismo come conseguenza necessaria della scienza.

Autori e filosofi nel corso dei secoli (sia aristotelici, ma soprattutto neoplatonici, gnostici, ermetici, e compagnia bella) postulavano invece la scienza come il metodo principe (anzi, il solo) per avvicinare l'uomo alla divinità.

Non vedo perché non debba essere così.

Un approccio puramente scientifico dovrebbe portare, come unica conseguenza necessariamente logica, all'agnosticismo metodologico: sospendo il giudizio fino a prova contraria.

Il negare l'esistenza di qualcosa che non sia visibile e misurabile è un passo successivo, un atto di scelta personale, come lo è il credere che ci sia qualcosa che vada al di là dei cinque sensi e della materia, e quindi di qualsiasi strumento, di cui non vedo l'impossibilità teorica.",0,1379936824,null,0,false,0,ccdqjpv,t3_1mtstg,t1_ccdqjpv,t1_ccclp85,null,1429371483,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

On the other hand, certain political projects would probably find very clear majorities with such a coalition, even topics that are very important and central to all three parties (minimum wage, abolishing the child care subsidy, …).

I personally think that the SPD has a moral obligation to at least try (in good faith) to form a red-red-green coalition (and the other parties have a moral obligation to cooperate in good faith).

true,Kartoffelplotz,null,null,"Well, most criticism in that direction was aimed at the the Greens focusing on their tax-plans for their campaigning. By doing that, they almost completely left their niche of ecological politics they inhabited and where they gained most of their votes. 

Most voters were concerned about the Greens leaving their ""native"" area of politics to the CDU/CSU, which was an especially bad move considering that the transition towards green energy is one of the biggest topics in German politics right now and for the foreseeable future. 

In some post-election interviews, the leaders of the Greens already admitted that mistake, but of course far too late.

Concerning whether it makes a difference if the Greens or the SPD enter a coalition with the Union: Yes, it does. The SPD is far more experienced in terms of great coalitions and government in general, but at the same time the last time they entered a great coalition, they suffered heavily because they had to give up their claims on being an equal to the Union rather than a junior partner that can only become part of the government if they join forces with their big rival and subordinate themselves.

Meanwhile the Greens are in an interesting position. With the FDP not getting into the Bundestag, they can now take up the FDP's spot. The FDP has historically been the ""majority giver"" - they switched sides between the conservative and the socialist camp quite often, being a much wanted partner for gaining majorities. By using that, they gained more influence than they would have normally had based on their share of votes. Now that the FDP is gone and the SPD refuses to go into a coalition with the Left and would suffer heavily from being the junior partner in a great coalition once again, the Greens could seize the opportunity and install themselves as the ""new FDP"".

At the same time that would probably cost them a lot of identity, since they up until now have been strictly anti-Union on a federal level.

If you are registered in germany for a religion you have to pay additional 8% (Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg) or 9% (all other states) calculated from your income tax on top of it. Basically all religions can do this mandatory for their members.  
It works that if you are registered to a religion at the government they will collect those taxes for the religious groups as they do with your income tax but transfer it to the known bank account of that group.
And here comes the christianity part of it:  
  
""The church tax is historically rooted in the pre-Christian Germanic custom where the chief of the tribe was directly responsible for the maintenance of priests and religious cults. During the Christianization of Western Europe, this custom was adopted by the Christian churches (Arian and Catholic) in the concept of ""Eigenkirchen"" (churches owned by the landlord) which stood in strong contrast to the central church organization of the Roman Catholic Church. Despite the resulting medieval conflict between emperor and pope, the concept of church maintenance by the ruler remained the accepted custom in most Western European countries. In Reformation times, the local princes in Germany became officially heads of the church in Protestant areas and were legally responsible for the maintenance of churches. Not until the 19th century were the finances of churches and state regulated to a point where the churches became financially independent. At this point the church tax was introduced to replace the state benefits the churches had obtained previously.""

Well, up until now nothing has been decided when it comes to coalitions. During the campaign, the Greens strictly ruled out a coalition with the Union, but seeing that they have already lost votes forcing a reelection could be a bad move for both the SPD and the Greens (the Union does not hold a majority, if the left camp refuses to enter a Red-Red-Green coalition and neither SPD nor Greens join the Union in a coalition, no government can be formed and the elections have to be redone). Reelections could actually lead to the FDP getting into the Bundestag again, since they only failed to get in by a 0.1% margin and for reelections they would most likely be able to mobilize those missing voters. So in case of reelections, the Greens would actually most likely devoid any chance of government participation, thus making everything even worse for them.

Also, there have been a couple of Black-Green coalitions on state-level, so it is not exactly far fetched. Concerning their credibility: It is hard to say whether they would suffer more from going into the opposition to reform, but thus losing any credibility of ""wanting to participate in the government"" (and also chaining themselves to the SPD while the SPD doesn't really give a fig about them and will quite happily enter a coalition with the Union if that means government participation) or from entering a coalition with the Union even though that was ruled out in the campaign. Then again, everyone bar the FDP ruled out a coalition with the Union, but someone has to give in now or the aforementioned reelections happen and that will, as I said, most likely be even worse.

By that logic, we could say that not qualifying Egypt or Irak of beer country is arguable because ancient egyptians and mesopotamians did drink some kind of beer; not to forget that what we call ""beer"" is probably one of the easiest alcoholic beverage to make and has existed pretty much everywhere since the dawn of history.

When I use ""historically"" I talk about a relevant period of time, i.e. recent history, one or two centuries ago max. If you go back far enough, eveything usually seen today as ""typical"" of one country becomes aguably typical of said country.

While really popular today, drinking beer in France is a recent phenomenom; one century or even 50 years ago THE alcoholic beverage was wine, and at every level of the society, from the alcoholic hobo to the wealthiest bourgeois. 

And actually the discriminatory tax treatment of all other alcoholic beverage you're talking about play against you : those taxation are really recent, not more than a few years, meaning that they are created IN RESPONSE to the new popularity of beer in a country where the historic beverage is wine. 

Beer isn't less popular in France than in Germany because of taxations; taxations are created in France because beer is way more popular in France than before.

true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"&gt; those taxation are really recent, not more than a few years

Nope. Wine has long been receiving an extremely favourable tax treatment in France compared to other alcoholic beverages. Even before the latest increase of the alcohol tax on beer, it was 2.75 € per degree of alcohol and per hectolitre (thus, 16.5 € per hectolitre for a pretty normal beer of 6° ABV). Now, it has been increased by 160%, to 7.2 € per degree alcohol and per hectolitre (thus, 43.2 € per hectolitre for the same beer).

By comparison, wine has an unchanged flat tax of 3.60 € per hectolitre, regardless of the alcohol content. The tax on beer has increased to more than 10 times the tax on wine, but it was already 4 times higher!  

It all [comes down](http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/economie/pourquoi-le-gouvernement-veut-surtaxer-la-biere_342824.html) to the very, very powerful wine growers' lobby: Remember the noise they made when Sarkozy said he didn't like wine?

I'm also pretty sure that this differential tax treatment goes back all the way to the Ancien Régime: Beer is the quintessential plebeian drink, and any town dweller could brew it with a minimum of knowledge and care. For winemaking, on the other hand, the grapes had to be pressed in the countryside close to the wineyards (otherwise they would spoil), and the fermentation required large cellars nearby. It isn't a coincidence that winemaking is so intimately linked to ""châteaux"".

The high taxation of beer compared to wine in France has nothing to do with a recent increase in popularity of beer (beer consumption is actually decreasing), but instead has its roots in the same advantageous tax treatment of the aristocracy that led to the French Revolution. It is thus quite funny that it is being perpetuated and even increased by a Socialist president of the Republic...

&gt;  that means she's exempt from domestic law.

Well there is a slight problem there .. diplomatic immunity 

She wasn't in a diplomatic  vehicle, she had no diplomatic immunity on the vehicle. as such she would not be arrested however she can be removed from the vehicle (if that was not designated as diplomatory or consular veichals. 

&gt; The Israeli soldier could try calling the police... 

She assaulted a police officer.

To make it clear  according to the fact the Israeli legal system is not put in place (West Bank is not annaxed) the police officer (it's called border patrol but they are a wing from Israeli police ).during this event there had been actuall military people on sight but they weren't operating (at least from the videos) and had been there for support

&gt; Israel on the other hand will get a well-deserved, talking to about mistreating foreign diplomats. It really is a serious breach of international agreements. 

From what the media now start to tell these diplomats initiated a course of a event (braking local law, entering closed military zone) that is an actuall serus *crimes* (normal person could have been put to jail for few years or being shot for that).

I don't think they would prevent many conflicts if any, but I haven't seen any conflict in my lifetime where foreign intervention bettered the situation. So I'd really be in favor of my government only acting in the certainty that their action *will* better the situation, not just facilitate our foreign relations. For Kosovo that would have meant actually intervening seriously, instead of becoming bystanders to massacre, for every recent conflict it would have meant *not getting involved*. Which luckily we learned from Afghanistan *before* helping with the invasion of Irak. 

Essentially the CDU and FDP already did what Die Linke proposes: no foreign interventions. They just did not formally rule it out, while still making clear that they aren't interested on sending the Bundeswehr into any conflicts. So non interventionism is already the stance of the majority of political parties in Germany right now, the point about weapon exports is the really interesting one. The population doesn't like it, the majority of parties don't like it, yet even those that were violently opposed in the past exported weapons once in government. Except Die Linke, who never got the chance to export weapons. Would they stay true to their promise or cave in like Die Grünen did under Schröder? Probably depends on their weight in a coalition.

true,AntisocialScientist,NRHW,U. A. M. R.,"They won't let new elections happen, it would be completely irresponsible and counterproductive. In regards to the AfD, giving them a second chance only a month or two after they scratched the 5% hurdle would basically be an invitation to parliament. To a lesser extent this might also ring true for the FDP. CDU, SPD and Greens will also consider the effect that political instability has on the markets. To be slightly dramatic, if people were to get the idea that Germany became ungovernable, Europe is over, done, finished. So, they absolutely need to work with what they got.

And of course neither party is keen on governing with Merkel, the SPD probably even less so than the Greens because they already got burned in 2009. But I think the ideological differences between the CDU and the SPD at least have been played up to respond to criticisms of a boring campaign devoid of content and competition. On a big issue, namely rent controls, they agree completely. In regards to the minimum wage, the difference is that the SPD wants to take the extra step of mandating a minimum wage of 8€50/hr once. Beyond that, they can agree to leave it up to employers and employees, even if they have slightly different approaches - the question of putting a commision in charge of it or not. The previous government also tried to make adjustments to the pension system. There's at least some room for consensus. I also doubt that people will shed too many tears about promises of tax increases being left unheld. They have clearly not been very popular to begin with.

And like I said not to overestimate the importance of big majorities, I have to add not to underestimate the SPD's masochistic potential.

For the Syrian military it would have been much easier to buy this stuff from China or Russia. Therefore I'm sceptical whether it really had anything to do with the chemical weapons program.

And do Syrians deserve bad teeth because the government could use the chemicals as a tiny puzzle piece in the production of a chemical weapon?

Can't talk about this subject exactly, as I haven't familiarized my self with it and I just don't care enough to do so. Just one thing, if one large company goes bankrupt it does not mean country will go bankrupt as you hope it will (There are more than plenty of examples).

As for war you seem to not understand the most basic things. They would ultimately win ""the war"" by your understanding, but would lose on all the other aspects. 

-Political (no one would trust them, meaning they could potentially control Ukrainian teritory but even the closest countries to them would slowly creep away from them, because they would fear the same outcome. They would swich sides.

-Economical. The easiest to understand thing about this is that war on itself is expensive, maintaining the control of the territory is even more costly. But the most of the problems flow from the political part. Countries would ""creep away"" from them.

And as for military part. It is just my personal finding, but you can judge the country's military strength by how well they feed their soldiers. To put it lightly... they don't feed them with quality food.

And lastly for failed states... Well it is just my personal views but I see most of the countries from FUSSR and it's sphere of influence as failed countries.

Leaning towards center will cost them their support amongst the left, while leaning to the left won't significantly diminish their support in the center as those people have already cast their vote for Merkel. The left wing won't tolerate another coalition like the last, their voters won't either, so they have to either show they can bring their ideas into the coalition, won't get the support of the left wing of the party and not agree to the coalition, won't get the support of the left wing of the party and ignore them risking a new split of the party (which would probably be suicide right now) or getting the left wing on boat, but losing voter support once again, leaving them once again with no shot at chancellor. 

The left wing is powerful right now, voter support is unstable, their leaders would of course like to be part of the government again, but they'd also like getting a shot at deposing Merkel in 4 years. To get attention alongside Merkel you have to increase Merkels involvement in arising conflicts, which is only possible with concepts she is radically opposed to (otherwise she'll know how to take credit for it). Funny that those concepts are inside their election program, favored by their left wing and reason they got a better result this election than last time (they lost votes to CDU, but gained votes from Die Linke, Die Grünen and FDP). 

Abandoning the left leaning points of their election program would be political suicide for whoever tries to role with it. Plus, there is just no reason to not try to force their program on the CDU.

At some points the other countries will demand German involvement. And either Germany follows up or things will change against Germany's interests. That's the reality of things. We aren't Switzerland or Austria who are too small to get noticed. (And even Austria has foreign involvements).

That's why I trust a Realpolitik much more. It's easier for Germany to stay out of conflicts if we stay in NATO and take part in less controversial missions. Essentially what the CDU and FDP were doing.

Listening to UK people on the Euro / finance crisis is a little setting a fox to keep the geese. 

&gt; You need to back up this a little more if you want it to be credible. Just saying Merkel is bad doesn't cut it. The economic data at the moment says the opposite [...]

If there's any politician to thank for the current good economic climate in Germany today it's Schröder. Nothing Merkel did had any significant positive influence on that. Apart from being in a relatively good position thanks to the positive effects of HartzIV, the situation was further improved by lucky side effects from the Euro / finance crisis. Us suddenly being able to get money for very low to *effectively negative* interest. That made refinancing our debt much much easier and brought in lots of money. 

Her actions with the bank rescues and bail outs will be very costly for us though without really improving the mess that is southern europe. As much as corruption and waste needs to be fought, the austerity measures had devastating effects on southern europe. All this will come and bite us in the ass badly in the future while she keeps denying these problems exist at all.

impressions, schmimpressions..

edit: No.. not enough yet.

Her behavior is a little like the old joke about the guy who's jumping from the 50th floor of a skycraper. As he's just falling by the 5th floor, he says: ""Well.. this isn't so bad all.""

I may have spoken much to positively about HartzIV and its consequences. The SPD had no real chance to improve on the negative effects of HartzIV all while Merkel had 8 years to improve things but did not, mostly just denying the problem (There is no rich-poor divide etc). 

We have lots of people who will not get any kind of meaningful retirement because they're not paying in now, mostly because they just cannot afford to. Whole sectors moved to being run on Mini-Jobs. The poor get poorer, the education is lacking, there is no real equality of chances. The low wages again have a very bad influence on the southern european nations because it means that they cannot compete with us in the same way. We have more and more people working full time while also having to rely on HartzIV (""Aufstocker""). In the end these are hidden subsidies for the benefit for our companies, ruining the rest of europe while also meaning that we will have to pick up the tab at the end.

There's no such thing as trust in international relations.

&gt;maintaining the control of the territory is even more costly

Marinating the control of hostile territory is costly. Eastern Ukraine would welcome Russia with flowers.

&gt;Countries would ""creep away"" from them.

Just like they did after Russia attacked Georgia? Which one exactly?

&gt;And as for military part. It is just my personal finding, but you can judge the country's military strength by how well they feed their soldiers. To put it lightly... they don't feed them with quality food.

Don't be ridiculous. Russia's military budget ($90 billion) is almost 2x of Ukraine's ENTIRE budget ($59 billion), alternatively, 50% of Ukraine's economy ($180 billion)!

&gt;And lastly for failed states...  
A failed state is a state which has no real control over its territory and with no rule of law.  

http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/exorbitant-hotel-prices-threaten-to-keep-fans-from-ukraine-tournament-a-827152.html

""Still, the hotel is attracting significantly more attention in other places -- especially in mafia circles. A few weeks back, masked men wielding clubs and shields stormed the hotel's lobby and brought it under the control of the ""Lushniki"" gang, a criminal syndicate notorious for contract killings whose membership once included the man who assassinated Russian investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya in 2006. In the hotel, the attackers beat employees and shot a guest.""

Oui tu as raison. Mais c'est aussi une bonne grosse gifle pour François Hollande qui dénonce toutes les mesures que Merkel supporte telles que les mini jobs. Les allemands viennent de démontrer que eux aussi soutiennent les mini jobs. Ils préfèrent donc travailler avec un petit salaire qu'être au chômage allant donc a l'encontre des socialistes français qui traitent Merkel de tous les noms malgré ses succès économiques et politiques et malgré les échecs cuisants des socialistes français de droite comme de gauche.

I don't think an MBT is particularly useful to crush protests. You rather want a vehicle which is capable of transporting troops. The troops can better protect the vehicles, make arrests, interact with the crowd, block roads. The armour requirements are on the other hand fairly limited. It should be able to withstand rocks, petrol bombs, and small arms. But you don't need thick enough armour to withstand tank rounds. In other words any APC or armoured truck would do a better job than an MBT.

But more importantly: What will change for Saudi Arabia and the protests movements if Germany says no? Nothing. The Saudis will just go to another country to buy tanks. Do you think the US, UK, France, Italy, Japan, India, China, Russia, Ukraine, South Korea, and what other countries build MBTs would all say no? Unless there is an arms embargo nothing will change for them. But your economy has lost a few hundred millions or even billions and thus jobs and tax revenue.

I could understand the attitude if there would be an arms embargo by several important countries or if Germany would sell some exclusive technology. But otherwise it doesn't matter to the protesters or to Saudi Arabia. It only matters to the people and families who find employment.

I'd say that an even bigger factor is that, while red/red/green may have a theoretical parliamentary majority, it is nowhere near an actual popular majority: the added tally of SPD, Left and Greens is just 42.7 %, hardly more than the CDU/CSU on its own. If they attempted to make a coalition government, they'd face not only an overwhelmingly hostile media, but also the majority of voters: the leftovers of the FDP and most of those who have voted for AfD would rally the CDU/CSU in a take-no-prisoners opposition, led by the most respected politician in Germany, Merkel.

We've also already got a big defense pact in the EU, where our most important allies for any war against Germany are already members.

I could support giving terrorists a bomb of certain specifications if I know they *will* get a bomb anyways and know me giving it to them will make sure the explosion isn't bigger than necessary. That saves lives and is basically the same rationale I used in the OD case: it's okay to sell heroin to someone because he will get it anyway, if you make sure he knows how to do heroin and not OD.

Well, except denying the poor and unemployed the right to vote, but I highly doubt they'll ever make that an official policy of their party. Personally I'd suspect that's just a fringe opinion within the AfD, such a policy just would go against their plan of becoming the new liberals. But we'll see if I must stand corrected later on, the party has just been founded after all.

What if, 10 years from now, instead of 2 parties failing to reach 5%, 3 parties will fail to reach 3.5%? Lower the treshold to 2% then? It'd be a race to the bottom.

5% is a reasonably low treshold I would say, but I do admit, it is problematic that so many people vote for parties that they know will probably not pass the treshold. In other words, voters are disappointed by the ""big parties"". But the solution to that problem, IMO, is not simply to admit more smaller parties (for a pretty bad result of that approach, see Italy).

Final counter argument: small parties *can* make it. Green party went from fringe to government partner in less than 20 years. AfD almost passed the treshold on their first try (sadly). I like the system because while it doesn't allow for a large number of minor parties, it appears to be permissive enough to let a minor party to grow into a medium sized one in relatively short time.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The Electoral College is designed to preserve the voices and influence of the smaller and less populous states *(I.E. Wyoming, Alaska or Rhode Island)*. In a pure direct election, than the larger and more populous states *(I.E. California, Texas, New York &amp; Florida)* would have a huge advantage given their population, but with the electoral college, while those states STILL HAVE  a huge advantage, since there is a elector for every Representative &amp; Senator, and the aforementioned states all have a huge number of Representatives, it is slightly evened out by the ratio of Electors-to-Senators, since every State is restricted to 2 Senators, no matter it's size or population *(This is one of the major reasons why small states become ""swing states"" and actually matter in elections)*.

People call it outrageous, but if the European Union ever federalized fully, wouldn't countries like Ireland, Finland, Denmark or Luxembourg want similar guarantees? I mean, the influence of the larger states would still be decisive and huge, but at least their voice is somewhat preserved enough to still be heard and influence the proceedings of the Executive Branch's election. I mean even if the E.U. opts for a weak Executive, it is still a hugely important position. 

And I can understand the dates between elections. Senators are divided into three classes so the entire chamber isn't shuffled out in a single election and it's proceedings completely disrupted. This coincides with it's position as ""Upper House"", where it's supposed to be somewhat more bipartisan, deliberative and prestigious compared to the House, given it's longer terms, smaller size, and statewide constituencies. The House on the other hand, is not held to the same standards, hence why during every 2-year election *(compared to the Senate's 6)* it's members can be shuffled about so much and lines redrawn so easily, it's Representatives more in-tune with the public's immediate will and stances, which also contributes to it being more partisan. 

I'm unsure about taking office being based on *""travelling by horseback"", however, and am genuinely interested. Can I see a source so I can read up on this myself? 

Also, some of the major things I would change if I could would be the lowering of a Senatorial term to 5 years, the increasing of a President's term to 5 years and the increasing of a Representative's term to 2.5 Years.

up until the 2000s for us Norway was  women and salmon (sorry we are that shallow) . but then every time something blowed in the face we got remained by that. even that we were aware of AHLC we kinda ignore that and had been in an oferia . (I was one of the people in that offeria in the belief of a bright future)

* We also kinda accepted/shocked to hear about how the Israeli are seen as Nazis since the 2000s. 

during the same time we had learned about the actions of Norwegian ""funds""^[1](http://palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=157&amp;doc_id=8630) and it kinda slapped our faces. But the politics that really provided the enhancements had been terrorists attacks had related to the occupation (hint that was going on way before there had been any occupation). 


* The next serious reason is the activists this time Norway isn't that to blame but somewhere few years ""Finish/Norway/Danish"" activists had been lumped into one group .

How do you suggest dealing with the high levels of crime being commited by certain groups? Because it seems like lefties just want to pretend it isn't happening which means that the rest of society has to face increased crime rates because we don't want to hurt the feelings of these groups.

And if you lower the threshold to, e.g., 3%, you can easily construct a scenario where five parties hover around 2.8% of the votes. Given that a lower threshold would probably encourage people to vote more for fringe parties, I think this is not unlikely. 
The hurdle as is is fine I feel. It prevents fringe sentiments to garner representation in the parliament and to obstruct the political process. As others have pointed out, if a movement garners serious political traction, a party will sooner or later make it solidly into the Bundestag. Cases in point: the greens, the linke. 
The hurdles has been tested before the Verfassungsgericht btw, and the Verfassungsgericht says it's fine. Off course, any affected party can have the Verfassg. test it again in the face of the new reality.

(opinion part) I also believe the hurdle served very fine this year. Both the Linke and the AfD, if they had made it into the Bundestag, are basically political dead space. They (would) share a percentage of the seats in the Bundestag, but there is no constellation where they actually constructively support politics. Both are, at the moment, not able to enter any sort of coalition. Both propose some policies that are fundamentally at odds with central tenets of postwar German foreign policy (integration into the west, in particular EU and Nato, for example). As such, they just make governing harder. Now I would not call both parties anti-democratic, but both of them harbor proponents of some questionable ideas, some even close to being at odds with the constitution. 
I really long for the day when the Linke have their Godesberger program. That is the day when SPD leads don't have to pray the mantra that ""of course we wil not collaborate with ze evil communists), giving free brownie points to the CDU and being forced as junior partner into a grand coalition. There is a left majority in Germany, but it's distributed over 3 ( and a half) parties: SPD, Greens, Linke (and the pirates, to a lesser extent). But this majority can never be used, because one of the parties involved cannot be a member of a coalition.

First of all, the locals are gone, and that means you'll have less people in bars and restaurants, and in the museums in the week end.
All the shops are still open, maybe some restaurants will be closed... But the majority would still be open.
And you will enjoy Paris in the summer. Sure, if it's hot, it can he very hot (especially in the metro as it had been said before) but Paris when it's very hot can be really great (and it's not always hot in august, sometimes it's cold and rainy) You can hang out in parks at night : the parc de la villette, for exemple, have awesome events in the summer nights, like open air movies, concerts... And it's free. [You can check their website before you go :](http://www.villette.com/en/) Also, as not all the parisians can go on vacations in the summers, there are always events like that in the city, but they are usually not in the touristic city guides, and they only take place in the summer. You can also check the official webiste of the city of paris, many summer events will be listed here : www.paris.fr (don't visit the english version of the website, 90% of the website aren't translated)
And you can also check my favourite website when I was living in paris : www.mylittleparis.com ; check the sections ""restos-bars"" for awesome restaurants, ""insolite"" for unusuals bars, events, places to visit...

Also, you can take the ""rer"" (suburban train) and be very quickly in the ""country"" near paris, and vist some really nice villages, walk in the forest, have a bath in a lake...

No, an act of detainment did not happen there (nor any of that elements had there). 
in the example of ammunition transfer there is also no element of it (as the person go free). 

&gt; Did the person in question get ""detained""

to detained a person you perform a legal action: you say to the person you are now detained and a ""clock"" start ticking from that moment. you may use force to stop him. 

That is a really shity procedure as if that was not a legal detainment the person who perform the action can get jail time (this action can be done by a private citizen which is similar to citizens arrest but has many restrictions). 

legal paperwork must be filled for this, there are variants of this action which other actions will do that. 

to be sure denying the freedom of a person is not detaining in the legal meaning

You can see in Israel and the west bank to legal system:

1. Israel civilian law is a mix of Ottoman (civil) , English (common) and Jordanian (civil?)  legal systems 

The ottoman legal system had a religious party which based the Israeli , Lebanese and I think Turkish legal system. above all we also have the local adminstration laws that can supersede country law (if a regional council say you may get a fine for using non white color to paint your house or have sanctions on you  for example - this is a real law in Naharia)

2. Israeli military rule is based directly on the British military law

but there is civilian legal law  in Israel while there is military rule (military law) in the West Bank.

Awesome , it actually real good to read many views and while I read about the 1948 war it is always nice to see other views. 

&gt;  There is a lot to learn and read about Israel's past. I for one don't object to the settlers effectively kicking the Arabs out after 1948

there had been no ""settlers"" in 1948. the modern term of settlers apply to any Jewish person who lives cross the green line. 

and that during 1948 to 1967 no Jewish people had been allowed to live in the west bank, and their properties had been passed to property administrator of enemy states. one reasons of the tenses between Jewish and Arab post 1967 was the fact that these who had been removed in 1948 demanded their properties back (till today some of the legal fights continue). 

&gt; , that's how humans have always done it. What's the point in complaining about spilt milk? 

To make it clear the refence was to 1948-9 to 1967 not anything before.

That is only a snippet. Turkey has been playing a very destructive game in Syria and the overwhelming majority of rebels and jihadis have entered Syria from their territory. The only place in the Syrian border they have spared is Kesab an Armenian town due to the attention it would bring up.

[Víking Gold](http://www.vinrad.is/Media/w350/64c278c9cb98679a.jpg) is probably the most popular followed by Thule and Gull. Víking has a pleasant, lightly hoppy flavour, it's not too bad but not great. The others are piss-lagers.

The micro-brewery culture is only rather recent in Iceland so this one is up for discussion. My personal favourite is [Móri](http://www.brugghus.is/english/attachments/Image/Olvisholt-Mori.jpg), mainly because it's a good copy/tribute of Hobgoblin (my worldwide favourite). Other contenders are [Tumi Humall IPA](http://bjorspjall.is/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/21012.png) or any of the seasonals including the elusive [Giljagaur](http://bjorspjall.is/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/giljagaur.png) Christmas beer.",0,1379966811,null,0,1380128999,0,ccdzfdw,t3_1my2be,t1_ccdzfdw,t3_1my2be,null,1429367270,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Architecture in modern central and eastern Poland (which for the most of Polish history was also central Poland) is very different from German. See Old City in Warsaw, Kraków, Lublin, Przemyśl, Zamość, Sandomierz, Rzeszow.That's how most of the Commonwealth looked like. More Italian with Slavic twist, than German. The parts that do have German architecture are either multicultural Polish-German areas like Silesia, or wasn't even Polish 80 years ago :)


Regarding words I think facts are obvious.

8 pages of German words in Polish: http://slownik-wyrazowobcych.eu/tag/niemiecki/

Compare to 38 pages of Latin words in Polish:
http://slownik-wyrazowobcych.eu/tag/lacina/ 

We even have grammar system similar to Latin (6 or 7 cases, like Polish, when German has 4). We don't do the ""die/der/das"" business. One point for using German ""W"" instead of ""V"", though.

Half of the scientific, political, legal, medical and such terms are from Latin. From German we have mostly mechanical words (and even there half of them are from French)

Political tradition of Rzeczpospolita is taken stright from Roman Res Publica. Our institutions are based on Latin. Compare political systems - completely different. We sometimes ""borrowed"" some things from Germany, but on much shallower level.

I remain convinced Latin influences are much more important than German (but of course 10% is still big influences).

Regarding Jewish influences vs German influences - how much do you know about Jewish mythology and how much do you know about German :)?

Because I bet you recognise more than 30 heroes from Jewish mythology, and from German you probably only know Odyn, Thor and Loki :) And not much details about them.

The whole concept of ""Poland as a Mesiah of nations"" that was central to Poland during partitions is stolen from Jewish culture.

9/11. Whether you agree or not but NATO declared it as an attack.

Lieber Hännes

Du wirst wohl denken, ich hätte Dich ganz vergessen, aber das glaube nur nicht, 
ich denke noch alle Zeit an Dich. Ich hätte Dir auch schon längst mal geschrieben, 
aber ich konnte nicht dazu kommen, weil ich und noch andre Kameraden jeden 
Abend in die Spielstube (?), oder ins Wirtshaus gingen.
Lieber Hännes, ich sage Dir, es geht ????????????????? 
Wir haben Wein und Liquier (sic) in der Spielstube getrunken. Es hat manchen 
Groschen gekostet. Gestern war ?????????????dersoll sich ????und nächsten 
Freitag ist ???????, da soll deine Gotel (?) kochen. Da kannst Du auch 
herkommen, da wirds den Abend nicht schlecht gehen, da wirds auch ???? 
besoffen geben. 
Sonst wird wohl hier niemand mehr heiraten. Ich will auch nochmal ?????, 
ich und Du wollen ???? noch mal zusammen in die Spielstube, wenn wir gesund 
zusammen bleiben. Unser Schimmel hat auch gefohlt, es ist eine braune Stute,
mit 2 weißen Hinterbeinen. Auf Urlaub wirst Du wohl nicht mehr kommen bis 
Ostern, dann wollen ????uns mal die Eier zusammen hohlen (?) bei den z???
Es ist jetzt die Zeit, daß das schöne Frühjahr wieder bei uns einkehrt (?), 
wo morgens und Abends Amsel und Drossel ihre Stimmen laut höhren lassen, 
und man des Sontagsmorgens (sic) mal in den schönen Wald mit einer feinen 
Cigarre spazieren gehen kann, denn das war doch immer meine Freude.
Aber es sieht bei uns jetzt noch gar nicht so aus, es ist gerade wie um
die Weinachtszeit (sic), es liegt alles naß mit Schnee und schneit noch jeden Tag, es wird wohl in Carrel (?) auch noch kein Sommer sein. 
Lieber Hännes, ich bin Gott sei Dank noch recht munter und gesund und das 
hoffe ich bei Dir auch. 
Sonstige Neuigkeiten gibt es augenblicklich nicht.


Also viele Grüße von uns allen, und von deiner Gate (?), und bleibe recht
gesund. das wünsche Dir dein Freund Konrad 


*Seigertshausen*

*Dear Hännes*
*You will probably think that I had completely forgotten about you, but don't believe so, I still think about you all the time. I would have written you long ago, but I couldn't get around to it because I and some comrades/buddies went to the Casino or the pub every night. Dear Hännes, let me tell you, (illegible). We drank wine and liqueur in the Casino. It cost quite a few dimes. Yesterday (illegible) something something next friday, on that day Gotel/Gate (?) (presumably recipient's girl) is supposed to cook. You can also come that day, it won't be a bad night, (illegible)(something about somebody being drunk). Other than that I guess nobody else will get married here. I want to ??? again, me and you should go to the Casino again if we both stay in good health. Our Gray (grey/white horse) also had a foal, it's a brown mare with two white hind legs. You probably won't come on holiday til easter. Then we will ???? (something about collecting eggs). Now is the time when beautiful spring once more returns to us, when blackbird and thrush let their voices be loudly heard in the mornings and evenings and one can stroll through the forest with a nice cigar on a sunday morning, as was always my pleasure. But it's not like that yet, it's like around Christmas time, everything is wet with snow and it still snows daily, it won't be summer yet in Carrel (?), either. 
Dear Hännes, thank god I am still in good spirits and healthy and hope the same for you. There are no other news at the moment. 
So many greetings from everybody and your Gate (?) (recipient's girl), 
and stay healty/safe. This wishes you your friend Konrad*

true,musik3964,null,null,"&gt;I don't think Russia and China count as non-interventionists. E.g., the Russians are deeply involved in the Syrian civil war even if they don't send combat troops. When Georgia tried to take South Ossetia the Russians intervened with combat troops. China intervened in Vietnam to punish Vietnam for their intervention in Cambodia. Both Russia and China are UN veto members and make use of it to pursue their interests. Both of them take part in anti-piracy operations near Somalia. India intervened in the Bangladesh liberation war, Sri Lankan civil war, Maldvies coup and they regularly take part in peace keeping mission. (Russia and China can't take part in those because they are veto members.)

The Russians might support one faction, but they aren't taking part in the civil war themselves. Non-interventionism doesn't mean impartiality. China hasn't involved itself in any international conflicts since, unless what they consider their territory is affected (Taiwan, Tibet). That's actually the reason these 3 countries are against military interventions. Russia fears intervention in Chechnya, China in Tibet and India in Kashmir. So the West is doing bad things for good reasons, while those three are doing good things for bad reasons ;)

&gt;9/11. Whether you agree or not but NATO declared it as an attack.

That's just another reason to not be part of the NATO, they don't even know what legally constitutes an attack on a sovereign country. Or did they purposefully reach the wrong conclusions to legitimize an attack on Afghanistan? Doesn't really matter which option you pick, it doesn't really help the NATO's image. 

&gt;That's not true. Germany is part of, e.g., the war in Afghanistan, the Baltic Air Policing, anti-piracy operations, and even in the Iraqi training program. The only exception was the Libyan intervention.

Their last direct participation in a NATO operation has been Afghanistan. Helping sort out the mess in Irak happened *after* Germany and France made significant attempts to stop the NATO from attacking Irak. Somalia is with UN mandate. So a formulation of ""more recent"" can apply ;)

&gt;Without NATO Germany would require more military spending because it's military forces would have to conduct international missions on their own.

*If* Germany leaves the NATO, they will probably stop conducting any international missions without EU or UN support. Germany isn't known to involve itself directly into other conflicts without another organization taking on responsibility.

Today though the goals of Die Linke have changed to a really social election program with (in my opinion) good and progressive ideas regarding tax reforms (generally taxing the rich while taking pressure away from the middle and mostly the working class), a new concept of electricity taxes, Mindestlohn, pensions, etc. Germany is going to need these reforms in the near future and basicly, everybody knows it.

Most importantly (for me personally) they are the only party today that is 100% contra warfare and weapon exports which is also why SPD and Grüne always call them ""not able to govern"".

In all seriousness though, this party has a really dark history and some extremist members are still around today. They need to get rid of them as soon as possible and switch to a slightly less radical left wing standpoint as a whole (which I think is the way Gysi wants to take) in order to reach wider masses in Germany.

Tellement que les allemands en sont très contents et ont re-élu Merkel avec une majorité énorme et avec une cote de popularité qui ridiculise Hollande. Ça a du mal à rentrer ça on dirait. Les allemands aiment leur système qui leur donne du travail et le préfèrent au chômage de masse français qui rend Hollande très impopulaire. Comme je l'ai dit en France quand on parle des mini-jobs allemands, l'accent est toujours mis sur les travailleurs précaires, travailleurs pauvres, intérimaires etc. Tout pour noircir le tableau. On avance le chiffre d'environ 8 millions de personnes dans la précarité tout en travaillant. Ce chiffre de 8 millions fait cependant l'amalgame entre ceux qui sont satisfaits de leur situation, et ceux qui ne le sont pas. Comment peut-on être satisfait de cette situation ? Quand on est étudiant, par exemple. Les mères au foyer, qui y trouve un revenu complémentaire. Des retraités, qui ont assez pour vivre, mais veulent encore profiter un peu de la vie. Tous les emplois précaires ne sont pas occupés par des personnes en difficultés. En France, le salaire minimum étant trop élevé, tout ces gens se retrouvent au chômage.

&gt; Mais j'oubliais la grande doctrine de nos amis libéraux ""Arbeit macht frei"" ce vieux dicton allemand.

Il n'y a qu'en France où l'on pense que Hitler était libéral, quelle ignorance! quelle connerie sans fin! Hitler était un socialiste (national-socialiste) et un étatiste keynésien tout comme Hollande mon cher. L’économiste proto-keynésienne et socialiste Joan Robinson a écrit que « Hitler avait trouvé un remède contre le chômage avant que Keynes ne termine de l'expliquer. ». D'ailleurs Keynes lui-même admirait le programme économique nazi, et a écrit dans la préface à l'édition allemande de la Théorie générale:

&gt; La théorie de la production dans son ensemble, que le livre suivant est tâché de fournir, est beaucoup plus facile à adapter aux conditions d'un État totalitaire, que la théorie de la production et de la distribution dans les conditions d'une libre concurrence et d’une large dose de laissez-faire.

Le socialisme, qu'il soit appliqué par les fascistes, les nationalistes ou les soviétiques a toujours été anti-libéral et contre le laissez-faire. Au contraire, le socialisme est propice et fonctionne mieux sous le totalitarisme comme Keynes lui-même l'a dit.

&gt; No German or Belgian influences in Finnish beer?

German influences have been huge.

It goes way back to BCE as Finns probably learned brewing beer from Germanic people because many beer related words such as *olut* (beer), *mallas* (malt), *vierre* (wort) and *humala* (hops) are originally Germanic loans. 

Through the middle ages Finns brewed ales. Heh, in 1555 Sweden's archbishob Olaus Magnus wrote that drinking Finnish beer grows people to endure any kind of hardship and it makes women so fertile that they mostly have twins.

The German influences are obvious in modern days. Industrial breweries started booming in the 19th century and the brewing technique with bottom-fermenting yeast was learned from Bohemia. During 19th century most Finnish brewery masters learned their trade in Germany.

Management got an idea to put new fast trains on lucrative Berlin - Prague - Vienna line. Initially, they ordered ten trains from a local manufacturer but this company went tits up. So they switched to Pendolino and for the money they were able to buy only five trains.

These trains had lot of technical problems at the start and were unable to get proper certification from Germany and Austria for years. So they were used locally, on shorter lines and were not profitable. Because this plan was purely commercial enterprise for railway company it was not possible to obtains state subsidies here.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I'm late in the thread and this will be a WoT, but I feel there are still some points that are missing.

The writers of the German constitution had the advantage of being able to draw from many real-world observations, notably from our own experience with the Weimar Constitution. In Germany, parties are part of the design of the electoral system, whereas in the US, they only emerged as a consequence of a system that, at its core, is about persons representing electoral districts.

Let's talk about the US system for a moment. The basic idea to me seems to be that people in an electoral district send off one from amongst their mid to represent that district's interest in the House. The assumption appears to have been that the people share a common interest based on geography, but in practice this doesn't seem to be the case, and political priorities are based on other factors instead.  
The result of this was that voters who opposed the candidate most likely to win rallied behind the most auspicious candidate they would rather have represent them, and the best way to ensure that they wouldn't split their votes in favor of the one they agreed they wouldn't want was to form parties in which they agreed on a common candidate. So, parties in the US, the way I see them, are essentially electoral clubs to ""prevent the other guy from winning"".

In contrast to that, parties in Germany (and most other countries) are active throughout the entire electoral period and develop positions on ongoing developments. Because coalitions, and consequently compromises, are necessary to form governments, and because there are more than one opposing parties, there's an incentive to argue *for* ones own positions rather than *against* those of your opponents. That is, they *tend* to be more constructive than destructive, although obviously this isn't absolute, and strategic considerations do play a role.  
After all the votes are cast, typically two or more parties have to negotiate an agreement to form coalition, and this further ensures a compromise based approach to policy making. Coalitions can also break apart, and parties can regroup to elect a new chancellor at any time, btw.

On financing:

Parties in Germany have several sources of income. Their proportions vary from party to party, but typically, their largest sources of income are membership fees plus a share of the salaries their representatives receive, public financing based on the number of votes received in elections, and only after that donations. They can have additional sources of income, like foundations or even property, but the point is, they rely much less on donations than their American counterparts.

Finally, to answer your original question:

I quite like our system. It's not perfect, but I think it's a good compromise. A lower threshold than those 5% would allow for a more granulated representation, but at the cost of stability. Situations such as right now, where a relatively large proportion of votes ""got lost"" are unusual (in fact, it's never been that many), and several parties have demonstrated that changing the political landscape by passing the threshold is possible.  
Tactical voting, such as considering the threshold, ""lending votes"" to parties threatened by it, or voting to influence proportions of coalitions rather than entirely based on the parties' electoral programs is half the fun.",0,1379974974,null,0,false,0,cce2msb,t3_1mxxxv,t1_cce2msb,t3_1mxxxv,null,1429365761,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Human rights apply to single individuals too, not just groups of individuals and certainly not groups of individuals reduced down to a common denominator. One Roma behaving exactly like one of his fellow citizens not treated equally because other Roma have shown criminal tendencies is frowned upon by those that granted them the right to equal treatment and also graciously granted you the right to voice your contrary opinion, yet not act on it (I hope you like this less metaphysical and more social-Darwinist approach). Basing suspicion on ethnicity is illegal, no matter if statistics point that way or not, *because the individual is not at fault for what other people of that ethnicity did*. In essence, using statistics to specifically target some groups over others *is against European law* and punishable. 

That's actually a fact and therefor not really up for opinion. Singling out Roma because of crime statistics is treated as abuse of power and discrimination by the European Court of Human Rights.

An excellent way to get to know many wines and discover what do you like is finding out when is the day they open to the public the Salón Gourmets and spending an afternoon there. They only open for free the last day I think, but you get to try everything there for free. I go there for business every year and it's always a lot of fun. 

Also I recall there was a nice bar near Opera with an excellent wine selection, where Viuda Blanca Viuda Negra used to be, the had wines that are usually two expensive to buy by the glass and they sold them either by glass or by carafes conining 2-3 glasses.

Another time was in Regent's Park (I was treated like some kind of American stereotype for asking for a Diet Coke with ice, then told to leave the cafe because I hadn't purchased a meal).  Another time was at a Prett.  I asked for ice and the woman working there just said, ""No.""  To be fair, at another Prett near the British Museum they did give me ice.  In all these situations I was very polite (said ""please"" and ""thank you"") and it was incredibly hot outside by UK standards.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; By your logic any country can just demand what it wants and then negotiating and reducing those demands would be concessions. Great!

&gt; I'll phone my father tomorrow and tell him I demand 500 Euros. Then I'll talk to him for a few minutes and in the end I'm going to insist on 200 Euros. What a concession I have made!

No, that's not the same at all. That's what the Palestinians are doing. They make a claim like ""Israel must withdraw from the area given to the Arab state in 1947"" and then say, ""well, no, we'll accept just the 1967 borders"" as if that's a real concession. It's not. The Palestinians have no way of securing either outcome, so changing one ludicrous claim to a slightly less ludicrous claim isn't a concession. They aren't giving up anything.

On the other hand, Israel is actually making a concession. The comparison here would be this: you and your dad agree that your dad will give you 500 euros. You get drunk and break your dad's car, so he tells you he'll give you 200 euros instead. He's not doing what he would do, but he's still giving you *something*, something that he doesn't *have* to give you. Do you get what I'm saying here?

&gt; Israel doesn't have a formal right to expand their territory at will on occupied land. The only situation where this might be forgiven is when certain areas are crucial to defence or life. The problem with that however is that such reasoning can easily be misused.

Nobody has ever the ""formal right"" to expand their territory at will, and yet, most people on Earth have tried to do so. And when they give up land, it's a concession. They are *conceding* something that they have taken, regardless of how they got it.

&gt; Germany, very pro-Israel and for years lenient towards them. One of those countries that vote pro-Israel in the EU and the UN. Do you think Germany would ask to stop building new settlements if it were such an impossible demand? Merkel really isn't known for being a harsh critic of Israel.

Yes, I think that Germany *would* ask Israel to stop building new settlements despite it being an impossible demand. I think that Germans don't understand or appreciate or really care what Israel can or will do. They have no idea what's going on between Israel and the Palestinians and they have no willingness to investigate further.",0,1379987186,null,0,false,0,cce6y57,t3_1msdp9,t1_cce6y57,t1_cce4kf3,null,1429363747,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

&gt;Au contraire, le socialisme est propice et fonctionne mieux sous le totalitarisme comme Keynes lui-même l'a dit.


Keynes n'est même pas socialiste, et son modèle économique a contribuer a créer plus de richesses dans les pays occidentaux que jamais avant. donc encore une fois bon.


Mais au delà de mes piques faciles contres une idéologie de gamins pourri gâtés qui veulent pas qu'on leur pique une partie de leur gouté pour le voisins mon propos peut se résumer à ça :

**C'est ça, t'as le décompte par catégorie socio-prof pour justifier ta propagande ?**

Moi j'en ai et c'est 15,8% de personnes sous le seuil de pauvreté en Allemagne, malgré une croissance moins atone que la zone euro, et avec seulement 5% de chômeurs. Contre 13,9% en France avec 10% de chômeurs Donc ouais ça crée un travail subventionné par la collectivité qui maintien des travailleurs dans un état d'indigence. Ouais vive le travail allemand. C'est un maquillage complet des comptes publics (que la France fait aussi mais avec moins de souplesse car la compta est très encadré) et sociaux pour cacher des déficits. C'est des länders sur-endetté pour certains, à faire palir nos propres collectivité. Ya des trucs très biens en allemagne par ailleurs, mais ça ne rachète pas les tares.

Hard things:

The writing system is a mess. For years I had a halfway decent spoken English level, but I couldn't write for shit. Then it more or less clicked in my brain and now I can write a little better, but I still sometimes fuck up double consonants.

Word order. We hates it, we fucking hates it. [Rules like this](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/cyc/a/adj.htm) on adjective order are insane.

Prepositions: too many of them. Spanish (my first language) has 21. We learn them as an alphabetically ordered list as children. Once I tried to count the English ones and I stopped at 50. They all are subtly different in ways that are incredibly hard to formalise. Getting them exactly right is, I think, almost impossible for a second language speaker (I've probably made prepositional errors somewhere on this post already).

Phrasal verbs: they sound weird. Also, remembering what preposition goes with which verb. Also, remembering that some verbs govern specific prepositions (relying on, fighting over, worrying about, caring for, etc).

Stylistics in general, and sounding natural. I think while other languages are more grammatically demanding, English is quite forgiving that way, but it is more difficult to use the language in a way that both sounds natural and gets the register right (formal, informal, etc). The grammar is so lax that it allows many things first language speakers wouldn't actually say. It's also very hard to get them to explain why, as it's not usually clear to them.

Unlike other people, I learn best by formal methods (my school lessons on grammar were really useful, though the endless turn this sentence into passive voice exercises were a bit annoying and boring). Asking English first speakers about grammar, though, is usually a lost cause. I'm not sure if it's just me that learned a large amount of grammar in school, but Brits in particular don't seem to be very familiar with really basic things like parts of speech, etc. So that also makes it harder to get reliable corrections from first speakers.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  my main criticism of MMP and Party-List Proportional is it seems to give a lot of power to political parties since they make the lists.

Well, yes, but that's hardly avoidable. In FPTP systems, the parties determine their candidates as well, which could be seen as just a very short list. Independent candidates can still run for a direct mandate, or sometimes they're supported by one of the parties.  
As for the lists themselves, there are various methods depending on the country (or even within Germany, for regional or state elections). In some electoral systems voters have several votes that they can distribute among list candidates of one or even more parties (of which candidates don't even necessarily have to be members), which kinda turns the party lists into mere recommendations.

In practice, however, the parties do have a lot of influence by determining the candidates they support and ordering them on those lists. And as far as I'm concerned, that's fine. I'm fairly interested in politics, but I still don't really know my regional candidates, apart from reading up on the top candidates of parties I consider voting for.  
What I do know is what the parties stand for, and I know that their programs reflect the consensus their members have voted on, which in turn becomes the basis new members join those parties on. Parties over here are active throughout the year, not just before elections. Members of local chapters know each other and elect delegates they find qualified. They invest much more time into getting to know the candidates than I would be willing or able to, so I know what I'm getting when I vote for party X, even if those candidates may not be the best speakers or able to finance their own campaign without the help of their party.

The point is, I don't even want to have to choose between hundreds of candidates. I choose a party, the party creates a list of people that reflect its positions. Most of all, I don't trust other people to gather enough information about candidates to make an equally well informed decision as those party members who have known them for years.",0,1380007918,null,0,false,0,ccecfgk,t3_1mxxxv,t1_ccecfgk,t1_ccebxvx,null,1429361135,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Ich bin der Meinung man sollte endlich damit aufhören so etwas medial auszuschlachten, man spielt damit den Rechtsextremen in die Hände.

Auch verweisen die Rechten dann wieder auf die Gerichte und deren doppelte Standards, führen die ihnen Recht gebende Kriminalstatistik an, bekommen neues Futter für ihre Hetze gegen sämtliche Ausländer und bevor man sich versieht, stehen wieder ein paar Menschen mehr vor einem Asylantenheim und schreien Flüchtlinge zusammen, die gar nichts mit all dem zu tun haben.

Es ist Zeit zu verstehen, dass unser Rechtssystem keinen Unterschied macht(oder zumindest machen sollte), was die Motivation angeht. Jemand der einen zugewanderten Imbissbetreiber totprügelt, handelt mit den selben, klar im StGB definierten, niederen Beweggründen, wie der Zugewanderte der auf den Kopf eines deutschen Jugendlichen stampft bis dieser verstirbt.

Theoretisch sollten beide nach Abwägung der Umstände gleich hart bestraft werden. Wäre dies der Fall, hätte man den Rechten schon mal viel Nährboden genommen. Würde die Presse nun auch objektiv darüber berichten und nicht eine Unterscheidung zwischen rechtem und zugewanderten Rassismus machen, hätten die Rechten weit weniger Themen, die sie emotionalisiert ausschlachten können.

Durch solch einseitige Berichterstattung wird genau das Problem gefördert, auf das man hinweisen will.

Corrigé ton message (je pense que c'était implicite mais bon)

Elles me vont très bien les CGU Steam, parce qu'elles ne sont pas sans contrepartie. On peut être contre les DRM par principe, ce qui ne me choque pas, auquel cas effectivement Steam n'est pas acceptable.

Par contre on peut considérer que les DRM sont acceptables sous plusieurs conditions : 

* Confiance envers la plateforme technique (va-t-elle fermer du jour au lendemain ?)

* Bénéfices pour l'utilisateur

La confiance se construit dans la durée et pour le moment c'est plutôt correct pour Valve. Maintenant on ne peut pas garantir que ça sera toujours le cas, certes, mais le seul scénario qui a du sens c'est que Valve fasse faillite. Ca laisse encore quelques années de jeu devant nous.

L'autre point ce sont les contreparties, j'en vois trois : 

* L'intégration des jeux avec Steam pour tout ce qui est achievements et communauté. Pas de quoi se lever la nuit, mais j'apprécie l'expérience.

* Le dématérialisé. Je n'ai plus acheté un seul JV en boîte depuis une éternité, j'achète sur Steam. C'est vraiment facile et pratique.

* Les prix. Il y a des promos régulières, j'ai pas payé énormément de jeux plein pot et je m'y retrouve complètement là-dessus. J'ai payé des jeux que j'aurais sans doute piratés si je n'avais eu que l'option de les payer au prix fort.

Ireland needed a high funding rate during the crisis, while France needed a low one. Some countries need a strong currency, others need a flexible one. 

It's a secret to no one that the euro is undervalued for Germany's economy, while too high for a good number of eurozone states. Sharing a common currency killed their competitivity.

During the crisis, [investors transferred up to 700 billion euros to Germany](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/TARGET2_balances.png) because when the euro explodes, they'll have claims on the Bundesbank (instead of previously having claims on the Central Banks of Italy, Spain, Greece, etc.).

Why ? Because the DM will gain 30% in value, while the other currencies will lose 30-50%. The Bundesbank will have to supply investors in DM, having in return claims on Central Banks that are on the brink of defaulting. 

This is why Germany wants to get out of the euro, but I don't think she will be the first to do so, as she can't pay the political price of doing it.

In the meantime, the rest of the continent sinks in poverty, with unemployment rates unseen since the end of WW2.

Ho semplicemente letto quello che pubblicizzano, ovvero una versione di chromium (e già qui storco il naso, considerato che certe sue caratteristiche lo rendono ben poco adatto a privacy e affini) moddata con un ad blocker e scriptato per cancellare i cookie a chiusura del browser e bloccare i tracker. Tutto qui.
Non solo tutto quanto promette è già disponibile per qualunque browser la fuori tramite plugin e qualche impostazione (togliere il search engine default alla barra di navigazione per non mandare query, usare la modalità anonima o qualche tweak in about:config in firefox), ma a questo aggiungono un sensazionalismo che disinforma alla stragrande. Un esempio? Pubblicizzano la navigazione in sandbox come quasi fosse esclusiva al loro browser, quando invece è forse la caratteristica più discussa di chromium. Oppure affermano di voler proteggere l'utente da prism ed NSA. Come? Semplice, facendo passare le ricerche tramite il loro proxy, utilizzato anche quando attivi di tua sponte per ""anonimato"". Rileggi questa parte per favore, capirai perché lo ritengo inutile. 
Non solo da la falsa impressione all'utente di essere al sicuro, ma lo vorrebbe fare tramite una feature che opera ha da anni e che non è utilizzata per motivi di privacy. 

TL;DR: placebo ingannevole sotto certi punti di vista. Leggasi la storia di SRware Iron browser per ulteriori info su una cosa simile.

Come difendersi quindi? In modo totale, questo è impossibile. Si può rendere più difficile il lavoro a pubblicitari e servizi internet usando i seguenti plugin:

-self destructing cookies (aggiungete una whitelist se serve);

-ghostery (configurate lo per fargli cancellare i cookie di flash);

-adblock con easy privacy (questo è un overkill con ghostery)

-phony

Disabilitate l'invio di query tramite barra di navigazione. C'è un'impostazione in tutti i browser.
Disabilitate la cache (su firefox fatelo da about:config) o cancellatela semplicemente se avete un disco a stato solido. In modalità anonima è automaticamente disattivata.

And THEN at some point if outside help agrees there's no other way you can take it by force. The thing is: which of Israel's partners thinks it's okay that Israel build more and more settlements?

&gt;Yes, I think that Germany would ask Israel to stop building new settlements despite it being an impossible demand. I think that Germans don't understand or appreciate or really care what Israel can or will do. They have no idea what's going on between Israel and the Palestinians and they have no willingness to investigate further.

&gt; Keynes n'est même pas socialiste, et son modèle économique a contribuer a créer plus de richesses dans les pays occidentaux que jamais avant. donc encore une fois bon.

Keynes était socialiste au sens de Hollande oui, et son modèle n'a fait qu'échouer, imprimer de l'argent et créer plus de dettes n'a fait que ruiner les pays (Europe du Sud etc).

&gt; Mais au delà de mes piques faciles contres une idéologie de gamins pourri gâtés qui veulent pas qu'on leur pique une partie de leur gouté pour le voisins

Comme dit le grand Tom Sowell: **[I have never understood why it is ""greed"" to want to keep the money you have earned but not greed to want to take somebody else's money](http://i.imgur.com/ZtBPZ.jpg).**. Je te laisse méditer là dessus :)

&gt; Moi j'en ai et c'est 15,8% de personnes sous le seuil de pauvreté en Allemagne, malgré une croissance moins atone que la zone euro, et avec seulement 5% de chômeurs. Contre 13,9% en France avec 10% de chômeurs Donc ouais ça crée un travail subventionné par la collectivité qui maintien des travailleurs dans un état d'indigence. Ouais vive le travail allemand

Le seuil de pauvreté est plus élevé en Allemagne, le chômage en France est plus proche de [20%](http://www.leparisien.fr/economie/chomeurs-mais-inconnus-de-pole-emploi-27-12-2012-2437759.php), et comme démontré, les gens qui ont des mini-jobs ne sont pas tous dans la misère, pour beaucoup c'est un complément. Ils en sont très satisfaits et ont voté en masse pour plus de la même chose avec Merkel. T'as vraiment du mal à l'accepter ça on dirait.

Quand des socialistes me parlent d'inégalités sociales, je pense tout de suite à [ça](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdR7WW3XR9c). Ce qui compte c'est que le niveau de vie et le salaire moyen soient plus élevés en Allemagne, ça montre que les gens vivent mieux, sont plus satisfaits et cela se voit dans la cote de popularité de leurs dirigeants: ils en redemandent!

Es gibt eine **parlamentarische** Mehrheit links der Mitte, aber was die gesellschaftliche Mehrheit angeht, halte ich es mit Jürgen Trittin. Der hat auf der gestrigen Wahl-Nachlese der Grünen erkannt, dass wir es mit einer 'konservativen Mehrheit' zu tun haben, die im Parlament nur verhindert wurde, weil FDP und AfD gepatzt haben. Wenn wir den im Bundestag vertretenen 41,5% der Union die nicht vertretenen 4,8% der FDP, 4,7% der AfD und zusammen 1,5% von NPD und Republikanern hinzufügen, kommen wir auf 52,5%, die bekannte (wenn auch nicht immer signifikante) rechte Kräfte gewählt haben.

'Schlimmer' noch, diese Mehrheit ist gewachsen und sie ist durch den Untergang der FDP und den Aufstieg der AfD weiter nach rechts gerutscht.

&gt;Keynes était socialiste au sens de Hollande oui, et son modèle n'a fait qu'échouer, imprimer de l'argent et créer plus de dettes n'a fait que ruiner les pays (Europe du Sud etc)

Parce que tu penses que la financiarisation de la dettes publiques et privé depuis les années 90 n'y a pas contribué ? Parce que la lutte forcené anti-inflation n'y a pas contribué ? Parce que laisser les banques privés êtres les récipiendaires des émission monétaire n'y a pas contribué ? Parce que tu penses que le modèle européen de niquer toutes les protections européennes tandis que les autres (US, Chine, etc..) se protégeaient encore plus n'y a pas contribué ? Parce que tu pense que donner des milliards gratos pendant des années à des pays en leur disant que tout va bien, sans intervenir pour restructuré leur économie tout en faisant des clients de l'Allemagne, en les aidant à maquiller leurs comptes pour masquer la fraude fiscale n'y a pas contribué ? Et ne parlons même pas des cadeau fiscaux fait depuis 20 ans qui ne changent rien à une croissance atone, que ce soit aux US ou en Europe.

true,cleefa,IREL,Ireland,"Mind if I comment? I'm technically a native speaker but I was educated through Irish.

Pronunciation: English begs, borrows and steals from other languages and you nearly need to know which one in order to figure out how to pronounce a word. In Irish if we borrow a word we change how it's spelled so it's more phonetic and more consistent. I pity poor tourists who are forced to try and pronounce anglicized Irish place-names. In particular Kiltimagh. It's just cruel. 

Fuzzy grammar: There are all these 'rules' that no one agrees on and they have exceptions. 

Spelling: see pronunciation. Irish has one spelling rule, which sometimes leads to long words, but you can't break it!

Vocabulary: It has a lot of words from many different languages - this makes puzzling out meanings of new words difficult. Irish is a bit like German - we like taking words and sticking them together to make new words. 

Irregular verbs: So many. Irish has 11 and they are the most common ones so you have them learned off pretty quick.

Verbing: suddenly anything and everything can become a verb! It's weird. Useful though.

Vagueness: English seems more ambiguous to me. It's easier to misinterpret something. I think it goes back to a less rigid grammar. 

Tenses/Cases/Syntax: These don't match which can lead to fun. It's also why Hiberno-English is a bit odd.

**Good things:**

Plurals: so easy.  

Mutations: Irish mutates both the start and end of the word depending on tense/case/subject/other. If you make a mistake (mostly when writing) it can be confusing. English has very little mutation/conjugation.

Brevity: It's much easier to write short concise sentences. 

Yes &amp; No: You have words for these! We don't which doesn't help with the brevity issue.",0,1380024167,null,0,false,0,ccee9xs,t3_1mzcz1,t1_ccee9xs,t3_1mzcz1,null,1429360274,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

The alternative adjustment mechanisms are changes in internal prices and wages, movement of people and of capital.

If the residual flexibility is enough, or if the existence of the euro induces a major increase in flexibility, the euro will prosper.*

*Will the euro contribute to political unity? Only, I believe, if it is economically successful; otherwise, it is more likely to engender political strife than political unity.*

*If not, as I fear is likely to be the case, over time, as the members of the euro experience a flow of asynchronous shocks, economic difficulties will emerge. Different governments will be subject to very different political pressures and these are bound to create political conflict, from which the European Central Bank cannot escape.”*

the Term should be ""elektroingenieur"" which you might want to search for.


Xing is sure worth a try, if you get connected. I am in Sales but I at least every week a Job offer for the fields I have been in and curtly am.

Usually for every kind of engineer Xing should do its work.

As you said you looked the term elektroingenieur up on Monster and did not find much, I found over 500 pages with that term.

Why would you look into the Munich Area? TBH (IMO) Munich is expensive, is not what you think about Germany most of the time, is full of snops and douches... Well it’s clear though.


I always experience that people from outside Europe like Munich and hear a lot about it... but Germany got so much more to offer - The north is quiet nice, Hamburg, Bremen...


East - Berlin the New states - Leipzig etc...



The West is pretty nice for work (NRW Area) (currently moved here, and have to say all those big cities close to each other, got something good!).

Well I drift away...
Do not choose only Bayern, not just because most of Germany does hate Bayern, just because you should have a clear opinion on Germany.


Now to your Resume - CV.


You NEED a CV (statistically) in any point usually, especially if it comes to technical stuff.  


You need a Cover letter; you need a picture and copies of greater achievements. 


(This is the least I demand in sales when I hire new staff).

• CV

• CL

• Picture

• Copies of Achievements - Degrees

I could help you with the basics on your (I guess PDF Files) on what to include, usually its better to get more in then less.



Optimal would be:

•Cover

•Cover letter

•CV (including Picture)

•testimonials (degrees) + credentials (only from the last employment)

•decorations (academic distinctions - Technical distinctions)

L'État français conduit une politique étatiste à l’extrême avec l'un des taux de prélèvement les plus élevés au monde. Il est difficile de faire plus anti-libéral que cela. Si réguler le marcher du travail, réguler la santé, réguler la retraite, les 35 heures, avoir un code du travail de plusieurs milliers de pages c'est être libéral alors je ne veux pas être libéral! Le libéralisme classique est proche du minarchisme, de la liberalisation de tous les secteurs, de la flat tax proche de 0 et de la séparation de l'État et de l'économie. Là, on est en plein capitalisme de connivence et interventionnisme. La France, de part sa politique de keynésianisme et interventionniste dépense plus qu'elle ne gagne, elle doit par conséquent être à la merci de ceux chez qui elle emprunte qui sont parfois libéraux mais l'État français lui ne l'est pas sinon il n'aurait pas besoin d'emprunter pour dépenser autant car il ne serait pas interventionniste. 

Malgré le fait que la France emprunte, elle rechigne à passer des mesures de libéralisation de son économie et marché du travail comme le demandent ceux chez qui elle emprunte et qui aimeraient bien avoir des garanties de remboursement, au lieu de ça, la France ne fait qu'augmenter les impôts avec ses dépenses et abuse de la pression que lui permet la taille actuelle de son économie. Jusqu'au jour où les autres en auront marre et arrêteront de lui prêter, là, la France sera obligée soit de se libéraliser, soit de s’effondrer encore plus. J'attend ce jour avec impatience en esperant qu'elle fasse le bon choix mais j'ai des doutes vu que 99% des français sont pour l'étatisme et dépenser plus que ce que l'on gagne ce qui oblige à emprunter aux méchants ultra-turbo-libéraux responsable.

true,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"J'ai dit ""oligarchie libérale-mondialiste"", pas ""libéral"". 

Le mondialisme libéral, n'a rien à voir avec le libéralisme. Il ne garde du libéralisme que le libre-échange.

&gt;Si réguler le marcher du travail, réguler la santé, réguler la retraite, les 35 heures, avoir un code du travail de plusieurs milliers de pages c'est être libéral alors je ne veux pas être libéral!

En l'occurrence, c'est payer des ouvriers Chinois, Vietnamiens ou Bangladais pour que des européens consomment. La marge allant évidemment [toujours au même endroit](http://www.forbes.com/sites/russalanprince/2013/07/08/the-rich-are-getting-richer/). Et c'est un article de *Forbes*, avant que tu cries à l'influence des subventions étatistes et à la partialité.

&gt;Jusqu'au jour où les autres en auront marre et arrêteront de lui prêter, là, la France sera obligée soit de se libéraliser, soit de s’effondrer encore plus.

Haha. En fait non. Il y a eu des tonnes de [banqueroutes d'état](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9faut_souverain). On peut très bien décider de ne pas rembourser sans conséquence majeures. L'Argentine est un très bon exemple. Mais pour cela, il faut du courage politique.

Libéraliser le marché du travail dans une zone de libre échange, c'est mettre en compétition des ouvriers à 1$ de la journée avec des Français. C'est tout simplement suicidaire. Si on libéralise, il faut garder le contrôle des frontières et de sa monnaie (théorie de Milton Friedman). Sinon, comme on n'a pas le contrôle de sa monnaie et qu'on a affaire à un [immigrationnisme inconditionnel](http://fr.liberpedia.org/Mondialisme#La_confusion_du_lib.C3.A9ralisme_avec_l.27immigrationnisme__inconditionnel), on joue sur d'autres leviers, c'est à dire les impôts et régulations.

Mon alternative, c'est de l'État dans les domaines où l'État est justifié d'un point de vue économique (incertitude de revenus, barrières d'entrée élevées, impact urbain très fort)  : santé, éducation, transports. Et de l'État dans les domaines qui relèvent de l'intérêt national : énergie, défense, sécurité. Quand un marché n'a aucune chance d'être parfait (au sens de la micro-économie), il vaut mieux que ça soit l'État qui s'en occupe (en particulier les cas d'asymétrie d'information et d'externalités négatives, comme la pollution). De toute façon il n'y a pas de débat là-dessus chez les économistes, c'est entièrement prouvé.

Comme notre économie est fondée sur des marchés imparfaits (en particulier les ressources naturelles qui causent tant de guerres et de connivences), on ne peut pas appliquer le libéralisme partout. Dans certains secteurs, ça marche, mais il faut les conditions d'un marché parfait.

Ma priorité, c'est surtout d'avoir un État souverain, donc droits de douanes et contrôle des devises et de l'immigration. Sortir de l'euro et de l'espace Schengen est un pré-requis à toute reprise de contrôle de l'État sur l'oligarchie de *libre-échange* mondialiste (j'ai changé l'appellation pour toi).

true,narthgir,null,null,"&gt;Well, I was objecting to the use of force (law making, and to a lesser extent the school curriculum) to protect children from their parent's belief/culture. 

The precedent exists, for example Female Genital Mutilation, this is a cultural belief which most western governments have either already outlawed or are in the process of doing so. Parents who refuse to send their children to hospitals due to their religious beliefs are prosecuted under the law. These are just two examples of the government forcefully acting against someones beliefs - with the obvious difference that both involve physical harm to the child, however I argue that mental harm is just as valid. Surely you would object to someone being raised being told that all foreigners are evil and that if you befriend any of them you will be burned to death by an evil demon? It would raise the child with an intrinsic fear of foreigners.

I think it could easily be argued that the mental issues caused by religion, the fact that it teaches faith over evidence and actively discourages critical thought are actually major enough to scar people for life - in fact, it clearly does seeing as many continue to believe ""just in case"". How can anyone think that telling someone, *when you have absolutely no evidence that it is true*, that an invisible being watches every single thing you do, and if you do anything he defines as bad, you burn in hell for all eternity is not actually a form of child abuse. It is lying to children to scare them in to believing a load of nonsense. The ultimate Big Brother fantasy, with the added element of eternal punishment.

&gt;On a side note, religion is just one of the many reasons people kill others irrationally (nationalism being a huge one).

Agreed, but it is one of the main contributors whether it is Christians vs Muslims, Sunni vs Shia or Protestant vs Catholic. Secondly, religion also tries to interfere with day-to-day life (contraception, abortion, prayer rules, fasting etc) so it is more harmful than just the violence which results from it. Finally, it actively encourages irrational thinking and actively discourages rational thinking, this is one of the most poisonous influences on our society today and in my opinion goes beyond violence as religions worst consequence.",0,1380034021,null,0,false,0,ccegeiu,t3_1n0ld9,t1_ccegeiu,t1_cceflis,null,1429359269,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

If someone was to make a study on the effect of religion on well-being, they actually would probably have neutral or positive results, but it is not the core belief of religion. The core belief is in a supernatural being, and this can never be proven no matter how detailed a study you conduct.
