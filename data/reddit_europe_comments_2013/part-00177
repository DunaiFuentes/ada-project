true,Manzikert,null,null,"&gt;None of it is part of capitalism, though. Everything I mentioned is part of communism, because communism only works if everyone complies to the communist ideal. And if they don't, well, they need to be removed.

The same thing is true of people who oppose capitalism: look what happens to indigenous groups when they try to fight back. 

&gt;Some people work harder than others. Some people are smart than others, some people are physically more capable than others. This will give them an automatic and natural advantage over others, thus rendering them unequal.

And? Natural is not good. We should do our best to fix natural inequalities. 

&gt;Who will provide for this?

People who work, obviously. 

&gt;Who will make sure this all works?

Everyone, collectively. If someone willfully refuses to contribute to society, most people aren't going to allow them to continue to have a role in governance. 

&gt;Who will decide what a person needs?

Last time I checked, biology. There are certain things that you will die without. Those are needs. The rest is luxury. 

&gt;Who will decide what a person deserves? 

Nobody deserves anything. Deserves is an empty concept. We should try to maximize happiness: that's the only moral concern. 

&gt;Conflict creates fights.

Eliminate imbalances of power, so that any conflict would harm both parties. 

&gt; Surely you need a big force to make sure everything stays peaceful.

No, you just need to make sure that nobody is capable of harming others any more than they can be harmed. 

&gt;What if people want a state? Are they then not allowed to get it?

I'm a socialist, not a communist, so I have no problem with the existence of a state, so long as it's democratic. 

&gt;But we are in disagreement right now! This divides us.

That's not really a significant division. Neither of us are likely to kill or be bigoted towards the other. That's the sort of division that can, and must, be eliminated.

It'd be better if we can avoid doing it, but if violence is necessary, then so be it. The ends justify the means. 

&gt;How will you fix natural inequalities? Biologically engineer people to make sure they're completely equal?

Why not?

&gt;What if someone doesn't feel like providing for other people? Force him to do it?

That's what taxation is essentially, so yes, force them. 

&gt;So it's comply or get the fuck out? Sounds wonderful. 

What isn't?

&gt;What will you do with that person that just got kicked the fuck out?

I don't support kicking people out: I was explaining the communist point of view. 

&gt;So everything that will be provided to someone is nothing more than just food and water? 

Where did you get that? Those are the things that absolutely *have* to be provided. Luxuries are good too, they're just less important. 

&gt;Different things make different people happy. Some people get happy by winning, for example, and we can't let that happen! Winners are more succesful than others, this makes the people unequal.

If their winning comes at the expense of others, yeah. For example, I enjoy military strategy: it's fun. That doesn't mean it's ok for me to join the army and try to start a war so I get a chance to do it more. 

&gt;What does this mean?

Direct democracy

&gt;How? 

Ensure that everyone has what's necessary to defend themselves against another individual: a shotgun, perhaps.

&gt;What if the democracy doesn't want socialism? Is it democracy if you want socialism, no democracy if you don't?

Why would the people not want socialism? It benefits the majority, so it's going to be supported by the majority. If you're referring to the present situation, then yes, socialism first. Just to be clear, I'm not advocating a vanguard party or any of that nonsense. If we're going to be overthrowing the government, it needs to be immediately replaced with a functioning democracy, not a ""transitional state"".

&gt;I think you people are incredible dumb and gullible.

Again, socialist, not a communist. 

&gt;I'd kill communists if a war were to break out. Just like they'd kill me because I'm a threat to the communist ideal.

If you're willing to kill people because you don't like the way they *think*, you're a sociopath, and need psychological help. 

&gt;You just assume people will comply, you just assume people will lay on their back and take it

Take it? The majority of people would benefit. The ""lie on their back and take it"" part is right now. 

&gt;It hasn't in the past

Except sometimes when the outcomes of the referendum are simply ignored and re-voted in parliament where the government in power has the majority.

Also, the main problem in the democratic system most european country have is that usually when you vote for a party, you don't only look at what they think about the EU but also their national environmental, social and reform programs. Let's you say are a convinced pro-federalist and you have to choose between a pro-federalist party with racist views on immigration, a pro-europe anti-federalist party with a very nice national plan for more social fairness, and a euro-sceptic party with a great environmental project that will bring employment to everyone. Who are you going to vote for? And you have to count all those ministers with their own skills and ideas.

To me, that is the main problem. 

More over, it's not a national referendum on the EU that would change anything because it will undeniably turn into a vote for or against the party who introduced the referendum, especially in time of economical crisis. And even if it is just a european election, you always see the same faces defending one side or another. I remember EU election we had a few years ago, 65% of abstention and the winning government party just claimed they were happy to see the people still had faith in them. I was sick with rage.

Not if it's harmful. Really good murderers don't get to murder. Really good bioweapons designers don't get to release custom plagues.

If everyone has equal say, everyone has equal power.

If that has the potential to hurt people, jail them. Otherwise, let them go.

**As far as societal expectations of you, what are you taught from an early age (~6) until you complete your secondary education (~16-18)? Do others place a great deal of emphasis on your profitability, your happiness, a civic duty, etc to guide your future decisions?**

I feel that the emphasis placed on you in English schools is just to pass your next step, your next exams. The whole school system feels like a way of teaching you *how to pass your exams* and not to pass on of useful life-skills. I never had a discussion with anyone during school about what I should do after it all. Just preparation to take the next set of exams and to move onto the next level of education. The concept of a vocational guidance councilor is literally foreign to me, although we did have work experience days. These days usually just involved going to work with a relative and pissing about. There's no help from the school to do this, and it was pretty useless for most. Luckily I landed a place at the local newspaper through my own sense of interest; my current career path actually stemmed from that! It's pretty much something that has to be done by the school, but not something they take very seriously (30% of people didn't even bother).

Once I got to my A-Levels (final two years of education between 16-18) there was a shift onto picking your degree. This is where a strange elitism comes into play. You're basically told that you must apply to university, as there's no reason not to. This included people who were pretty sure they wanted to do other things or just weren't cut out for academic life. During this time I pretty much felt that I had to go to university or I'd be destined to be a bin-man for the rest of my life. The successful non-chavy, middle-class kids applied to university because they 'wanted to' [avoid being seen as a failure]. 

Now this is very subjective and probably not universal across Britain, but it's how it felt when I was 17. Choosing a degree here means specialising early as we don't do Majors and Minors - you just do your degree in a particular subject. But that means choosing what you'll be doing in four years when you're 16-17! For me that ended up being a Journalism BA from a Russel Group university (Slightly less than 'Ivy League' status). I chose that university because it was a Red Brick top ranking university and my teachers at the time were impressed. There was a level of social elitism, possibly inherent in our culture anyway, as people who applied to Oxford, Cambridge and the Russel Group universities got *a lot* of extra attention towards their A-Levels. Lunch clubs, after school meet-ups, personalised help with our application forms. Those who were doing A-Levels as their final step of education did not. Schools here seem to emphasis sending their students off to university as it makes them look good - and as such university is seen as a 'must do' for a certain class of people. 

I chose journalism because I'd 

tl;dr: The social prestige of university drives some people to go when they might be best off taking a vocational route. 

**Clearly many of the complaints and praises from the previous threads have merit, but they are all anecdotal and each persons experience in a given field will not be the same. The common theme, however, seems to be that the first priority is placed on high incomes regardless of the persons interest or enjoyment in the work, and on any STEM fields (science and medical fields, technology, engineering, mathematics) due to their high output, profitability, recognition, and other positives over seemingly ""lesser"" paths such as skilled trade work (plumbing, electrician, machinist, manual labors), social sciences, humanities, arts, teaching, etc. basically anything that either doesn't produce or isn't regarded with any prestige (in American society at least). How are career choices in your country similar or opposite of this particular emphasis?**

Aside from teaching I'd say it's similar here. Teaching is seen as a great route for a lot of university leavers, despite the pay. STEM is seen as brilliant, and people are jealous of those with the capacity to get onto a STEM course. The manual labour category is seen as jobs the people who didn't go to university do - I'll admit there's a class based edge to that as there is with a lot of things in the UK. Growing up middle class, there was never a question that I'd end up as a tradesman - even though I may have enjoyed it and it does pay relatively well here (pluming especially). I chose journalism most especially **not** for the pay. I saw my father work away at an IT job and be bloody miserable at it. I wanted something that was interesting, something I didn't mind bringing up in conversation. After university I had to re-shift onto more practical jobs to get money - and then the wage became all important. 


**Since a few countries have higher education subsidized by their governments, is the entire notion of incurring massive debts to pursue a degree unthinkable for you? (similar to the concept of debts from medical bills) Or for countries who do not have free access, how has this affected your choice (or not) to attend higher education?**

Knowing that my actual tuition was taken care of up front by the government, I honestly never thought about it. It was **never** a consideration before university, and would never be something to put you off. We also got an interest free loan to allow us to live and such. You pay this off based on your earnings and only once you start to earn over £15,000 per year and comes off of my wage like a tax - I never even see the tiny segment which it deducted. In my previous job I was paying back £5 a month! If you've not paid it off by a certain time in the future then the debt is wiped. Even now, unemployed, it's not something I have to think about.

**Following the theme of debt from a lack of free public access to basic human needs or rights (forgive me if that's inflammatory), do you have an overall lessened or non-existent worry and stress over finding, or keeping, a job that provides you with medical insurance benefits? Does this being a non-factor in your search allow you more freedom of mobility to change jobs?**

A complete non-factor. The concept of finding a job based on how good their medical coverage is is insane. As I've said, I'm unemployed right now and although I am concerned about things like rent and utilities I know that even if I get a major illness I've nothing to worry about financially (in fact, in a sick way, being in hospital would reduce my house bills!)

I've paid a tiny fraction of National Insurance (the NHS funding tax) in my brief career, yet I'm eligible for every medical procedure a multi-millionaire Managing Director who's paid NI for 50 years is. 

The thing which reduces my job mobility is simply how good or bad the job market is for openings. 

**What examples of occupations in the other threads are not common in your country, and vice versa?**

Not really applicable... I spotted the same types of jobs that are common here. Engineers, software devs, marketing, PR, banking etc. Mostly jobs in the services sector which is pretty much the British economy. 

**Is there much corruption (visible or suspected) within certain sectors? E.g. government work, education, emergency and medical work.**

Hard to say from my very limited experience. Unless you count the fact that people will do just about anything to get their own friends and family jobs - knowing someone is 90% of the application process it seems.

**What does life mean to you? A linear progression of school, job, work, then die or something different?**

At this point (mid-twenties) just getting a job where I can live a happy life out of my job. I dont think I'll ever make much of a career-man unless I do make it back into journalism. I'll take a well-enough paid office job and enjoy life with my family and friends. I may even retrain to something else.

It's really difficult to get a work permit nowadays because there is an EU priority system in place: French citizens are given top priority for job openings, followed by other EU citizens, then non-EU citizens. Theoretically any company that offers you a job will have to prove to the authorities when they sponsor your work permit that they could not find anyone in France OR in the rest of the EU to do that job.

I lived in Paris from 2011-2012 with a youth mobility visa and I'm currently working through the paperwork to go back, so I know a bit about the immigration process (it sucks). I'm Canadian though, so the specifics for an American may be different.

You could try to get transferred to a Paris branch of an American company, but in order to get your work permit the company would still need to prove to French authorities that they couldn't give your job to a French or other EU citizen. I think companies get around this by claiming that you have ""company-specific"" knowledge and training that is essential for the role.

If you're under 30, there might be a youth mobility agreement that could get you a temporary working visa for 12-24 months (giving you time to network and look for a more permanent job). You might have to prove that you already have a job offer there or at least the funds to support yourself (I think when I got my visa it was €750 for every month I wanted to stay).

If you're in a position to further your education, you could attend a French university with a student visa. If you're in a degree or other certificate program, they will normally give you a visa that is good for an additional 6 months afterwards to facilitate a job search. I know that if you graduate from a university in Germany the German officials waive the EU priority rules for taking a job; not sure if France is the same, but it would be a huge boost. However, if you do graduate from a French university, you can expedite the process for French citizenship... if you find a job in France after graduating there I think you can apply for citizenship after just 2 years.

France also has something called a ""skills and talents"" visa for non-EU citizens with exceptional skills that would make a substantial contribution to French society. I don't know how strict the criteria are or how many of these visas they give out.

**TL;DR** trying to move to France as a non-EU citizen sucks.

No, it is, to the exact same extent. 

&gt;But wouldn't that undermine previous statements you made? You said you wanted to ""fix"" natural inequalities. If someone excels at math chances are he is naturally more talented at math. This is not equal.

Yeah, that is unequal. It's not a good thing, but if we can't avoid it, we might as well take advantage of it by getting people to do things they're good at. 

&gt;Not if I shoot and kill you. Then you can't say anything anymore. 

And neither can you, because you'll be in jail or dead.

&gt;But you just gave everyone a shotgun, ergo they always have the potential to hurt people.

As long as we're reliant on physical bodies to stay alive, we will always have that potential. What's important is that we make sure that hurting others is never a rational choice to make. 

&gt; communist utopia, they are automatically jailed.

No, if people start actively undermining society, they'll be jailed, just like now. 

&gt;I thought you thought a capitalist society was bad, but your society does not seem any better.

People starve to death in capitalist society. Anything that can alleviate extreme poverty is better. 

&gt;Alright. But let's say, for the sake of the argument, that you'll let him go. What will this person do? Stay in the society, but not work? Will he receive welfare? If the welfare group becomes big enough, you'll get an entire group of people dependant on others providing for them

Yeah, and? Better than an entire group of people who are dead.

&gt;And, because everyone is equal, they will get the equal amount of food/money/whatever as the person who works hard. How is this fair to the working man?

When did I ever say that? I think that necessities should be provided for free. If you want scarce luxuries, you had better damn well work for them. 

&gt;What if a group of let's say a few hundred people decide to form a militia and rebel?

Why would they? If they're not trying to impose anything on others, it's not going to benefit them. If they're trying to reestablish capitalism, there are more people in a position to oppose them. 

&gt;And communism does it for all of the world. And, at least in a capitalist society, people get a chance to improve their situation. In communism this is not the case.

Again, socialist, not communist, and in either case, you're wrong. You're able to improve your situation simply by working. Need a chair? Chop down a tree and make one yourself, or do some work and pay someone else for the chair. In capitalist society, if you chop down the tree, you get arrested for vandalizing private property, and a portion of all your labor goes to your boss, so you have to work more to get the chair.

&gt;Ah, alright. Using violence and coercion to force people to behave like you want is okay, but wanting to kill these authoritarian nutjobs is not okay. Gotcha.

Yeah, that's exactly right. Murder is orders of magnitude worse than assault. In fact, I would say it's the worst single act you can perform. 

&gt;Yes, I suppose they would prefer to work in the diamond mines under communism as opposed to under capitalism.

There would be no diamond mines in a communist or socialist society, because nobody is going to be willing to expose themselves to horrific conditions for such worthless products.

true,c-herms,Normandie,Normandie," PARIS — For decades, Europeans have agonized over the power and role of Germany — the so-called German question — given its importance to European stability and prosperity. 

 Today, however, Europe is talking about “the French question”: can the Socialist government of President François Hollande pull France out of its slow decline and prevent it from slipping permanently into Europe’s second tier?

At stake is whether a social democratic system that for decades prided itself on being the model for providing a stable and high standard of living for its citizens can survive the combination of globalization, an aging population and the acute fiscal shocks of recent years.

Those close to Mr. Hollande say that he is largely aware of what must be done to cut government spending and reduce regulations weighing down the economy, and is carefully gauging the political winds. But what appears to be missing is the will; France’s friends, Germany in particular, fear that Mr. Hollande may simply lack the political courage to confront his allies and make the necessary decisions.

Changing any country is difficult. But the challenge in France seems especially hard, in part because of the nation’s amour-propre and self-image as a European leader and global power, and in part because French life is so comfortable for many and the day of reckoning still seems far enough away, especially to the country’s small but powerful unions.

The turning of the business cycle could actually be a further impediment in that sense, because as the European economy slowly mends, the French temptation will be to hope that modest economic growth will again mask, like a tranquilizer, the underlying problems.

The French are justifiably proud of their social model. Health care and pensions are good, many French retire at 60 or younger, five or six weeks of vacation every summer is the norm, and workers with full-time jobs have a 35-hour week and significant protections against layoffs and firings.

But in a more competitive world economy, the question is not whether the French social model is a good one, but whether the French can continue to afford it. Based on current trends, the answer is clearly no, not without significant structural changes — in pensions, in taxes, in social benefits, in work rules and in expectations.

But Mr. Hollande’s Socialist Party and the harder French left have not seemed to grasp the famous insight of the prince’s nephew in Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s renowned novel of social upheaval, “The Leopard,” that “everything needs to change, so everything can stay the same.” Sometimes, talking to French politicians and workers, one has the feeling that they all consider themselves communards and revolutionaries, fighters on the left — but at the same time, like the far right, they wish to lock into place the comfort of the known.

In May 1968, students at the University of Paris in Nanterre began what they thought was a revolution. French students in neckties and bobby socks threw cobblestones at the police and demanded that the sclerotic postwar system must change.

Today, at Nanterre, students worried about finding jobs and losing state benefits are demanding that nothing change at all. For Raphaël Glucksmann, who led his own first strike in high school in 1995, members of his generation have nostalgia for their rebellious fathers but no stomach for a fight in hard economic times.

“The young people march now to reject all reforms,” he said. “We see no alternatives. We’re a generation without bearings.”

The Socialists have become a conservative party, desperately trying to preserve the victories of the last century. Many in the party, like the anti-globalization campaigner Arnaud Montebourg, now the minister in charge of industrial renewal — let alone those further to the left — seem to believe that France would be fine if only the rest of the world would just disappear, or at least work a little less hard.

There is nonetheless an underlying understanding that there will be little lasting gain without structural changes to the state-heavy French economy. The warning signs are everywhere: French unemployment and youth unemployment are at record levels; growth is slow compared with Germany, Britain, the United States or Asia; government spending represents nearly 57 percent of gross domestic product, the highest in the euro zone, and is 11 percentage points higher than Germany. The government employs 90 civil servants per 1,000 residents, compared with 50 in Germany.

Hourly wage costs are high and social spending represents 32 percent of G.D.P., highest among the industrialized countries; real wage increases outpace productivity growth; national debt is more than 90 percent of G.D.P.

About 82 percent of the new jobs created last year were temporary contracts, up from 70 percent only five years ago, not the kind of full-time work that opens the door to the French middle class. That keeps nearly an entire generation living precariously, no matter how hard people study or work.

Last year, France was ranked 28th out of the 60 most competitive economies in the world, according to the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland. The United States was first. Even China, at 21, and Japan, at 24, outranked France. In the World Bank’s ranking of “ease of doing business,” France ranks 34th, compared with 7th for Britain and 20th for Germany.

In Amiens, in the north of France, Goodyear owns two tire factories. The work force at one has grudgingly accepted a change in work schedules, preserving its factory. The workers at the other have refused, and Goodyear is trying (not so easy in France) to shut it down, throwing more people out of work. Claude Dimoff, a former union leader at the more flexible plant, said: “I’m part of a generation that experienced the common program of the left. We had visions for the future, and different values, but all this is forgotten. The left has completely deviated from its promises.”

The country retains plenty of strengths. France is the world’s fifth-largest economy, with strong traditions in management, science and innovation. The gap between rich and poor is narrower in France than in most Western countries, although it is growing.

When the French work, they work hard; labor productivity, perhaps the single most important indicator of an economy’s potential, is still relatively high, if dropping. But with long holidays and the 35-hour week, the French work fewer hours than most competitors, putting an extra strain on corporations and the economy.

Large French companies compete globally; there are more French companies in the Fortune 500 than any other European country. But the bulk of their employees are abroad, and there are few of the midsize companies that are the backbone of Germany. Ninety percent of French companies have 10 or fewer employees and fear expansion because of extra tax burdens and strict labor regulations.

Even in France’s justly famous agricultural sector, the shrinking number of farmers has not been matched by a similar reduction in bureaucrats. Jacques Galaup, a farmer near Gaillac in the southwest, spoke with disdain of the number of hours he had to spend on paperwork — and estimated that there was probably one functionary now for every farmer.

true,c-herms,Normandie,Normandie,"Mr. Galaup showed off his records on the fewer than 30 cows that he raises. The files are thick and all done by hand; computers have barely made it to most levels of government.

In poll after poll, the French insist that they want renovation and modernization, so long as it does not touch them. That is always the political challenge, and Mr. Hollande’s conservative predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, is considered to have failed in his promise to make serious structural changes.

While complaining constantly, for example, about the horrors of the 35-hour workweek, Mr. Sarkozy never dumped it, but simply played with the tax consequences of overtime, a change that Mr. Hollande immediately revoked. One of Mr. Sarkozy’s advisers, Alain Minc, who tried to get him interested in Germany’s social market revisions, once admitted that Mr. Sarkozy was simply afraid to confront the unions and the social uproar that real change would provoke.

There is a broad consensus that real social and structural renovation can be carried out only by the left. But that can happen only if Mr. Hollande, who has a legislative majority, is willing to confront his own party in the name of the future, as the former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder did a decade ago with a series of legal modifications that now get much of the credit for Germany’s revival.

Mr. Hollande says he believes in “dialogue with social partners,” which has so far produced relative peace but little substantive change. With centrist union agreement, he has slightly loosened the labor market, making flex time easier and taxing short-term contracts more steeply. And in 2014 he is moving about $27 billion of social costs from corporations to the regressive value-added tax.

But what can seem bold in local terms tends to yield minor results, and these modest efforts have taken place at the height of Mr. Hollande’s power, which is inevitably declining.

In his book “The Resistance: The French Fight Against the Nazis,” Matthew Cobb quotes a man named Boris Vildé, executed by the Nazis. His last words were: “I love France. I love this beautiful country. Yes, I know it can be small-minded, selfish, politically rotten and a victim of its old glory, but with all these faults it remains enormously human and will not sacrifice its stature.”

But by refusing to grapple with its underlying faults, many here say, that is exactly what it is doing.

However new agricultural methods, for instance GMOs are real, that single property makes them far superion to fairy tales.

""Yes every industry is for profit, but that does not justify anything.""

That's a meaningless statement. You said that GMOs can not be regulated because this industry is profit driven. Well, this industry can be regulated just as well as any other industry, they are all profit driven. And in a free market a single faulty product can drive a company bankrupt, so the agricultural companies will be especially careful to produce safe seeds.

""The risk of gmo is real because we are experimenting with code at a binary level in an insecure environment, with risk of cross contamination.""

Well, that's not a real threat, just some vague, general statement. And ""code at a binary level"" is simply menaingless, DNA is not a binary code, four bases are incorporated into the molecule. You will be surprised, but we have been experimenting with spontaneous mutants for thousands of years, which we knew nothing about. That is surely a risk, don't you think? Could you provide some proof, that for instance a GM plant is more risky to grow, than another strain which harbors a comletely unknown mutation which arose by pure chance? If not, then what dangers are you talking about? relevant example, the cms-T corn: http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/05/on-the-evolutio-1.html

We, as in the Western world, shield the midieval Saudi regime and similar in the region, such as Baharain, from any modern kind of government or society. Be it introduced form the outside (Saddam in 1990) or the inside (Arab spring). With military and intelligence support as well as money. And a lot of that money we gave/give to them flows to radical groups. Over the years they have set up madrasses and a lot of church based charity work. All over the globe.

&gt; I suppose when Sunnis attack Shias in Pakistan, it's our fault too? 

Pakistan is different, though. You should check into Indian history if you want to know more. 

&gt; Muslims bear NO responsibility for 9-11, London, Madrid, Beslan, Bali (I &amp; II), Mumbai, and all the other recent incidences of Islamic terrorism? They are completely innocent of these crimes?

Osama is the result of Billions of Saudi dollars. I described to you above, why the terrorism and extremist Muslim problem is the result of strong Western support of midieval regimes that would be long gone, had it not been for us. 

&gt; Your professors must be proud of you. You are the perfect finished product of the modern humanities narrative.....a self-hating Westerner who blames ALL the worlds ills on the West. May God help you.

What does that have to do with education? Are you against education and knowledge? Against science? That would fit your political views. I did study business, btw. 

And why should I be self-hating? Osama is a bad guy. He could only become so big by outside help. Without us, he would still be bad, though not as big. But I don't see that as evil. It is an unintended consequence. Also I don't think the West is evil as such. It's just not good. Western countries do whatever benefits them. If a couple millions here or there perish, if billions more live under brutal regimes, so be it. And as I said: the resurgance of extreme Islam was never planned.

It split off with some help from the Red Army ;)

So here we go:

* Eastern half of the historical region of Moldavia

* We call them Bessarabians, because the name ""Moldovan can refer to both our Moldovans (eastern Romanians) or to citizens of Moldova.

* Romanian (Moldovan) majority, Ukrainian+Russian minority

* Young Romanians are pro-Union, elders and minorities are pro-Russia

* Politics is split between the Communist Party (not very communist, but quite anti-Romanian) and the ""pro-European"" parties, which are from neutral to very pro-Romanian.

* They can easily get Romanian citizenship.

* Its capital is Chisinau, and it has two ""autonomous regions"". One is peaceful, Găgăuzia, home to a Cristian Turkic minority (they have the right to secede in case Moldovans decide to reunite with Romania). The other is a ""breakaway republic"", Transnistria, the land that time forgot, dominated by the Russians there. The 14th Russian army has a ""peacekeeping mission"" there, and the place looks like it's still in the USSR (Lenin statues,hammer and sickle on flag, parliament is called ""Supreme Soviet"")

* Poor

* The regional dialect has a lot of Russian words and a lot of words that have fallen out of use in Romania, so it has an archaic feel sometimes.

* Calling the language ""Moldovan"" is very political. You will find a lot of Romanians insisting it's Romanian and should be called that. (There were soviet attempts to create a ""Moldovan ethnic identity"" and it reached ridiculous levels when they started insisting that ""Moldovan"" is an entirely different language, to the point of having a Romanian-Moldovan dictionary)

* Flag and CoA modeled on the Romanian ones

* Nicknamed ""Our brothers from across the Prut""

* The Orthodox are split between the ""Moldovan Orthodox Church"" - subordonate tot he Moscow Patriarchy and the ""Bessarabian Orthodox Church"" subordonate to the Romanian Patriarchy",0,1377501867,null,0,1377506854,0,cbvhwpm,t3_1l3pw8,t1_cbvhwpm,t3_1l3pw8,null,1429697167,64,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,64

[proof needed]. Security teams from active GNU/Linux distributions are fast and transparent.

&gt; Linux is not much better, just those two a rarely used so they have security through obscurity whcih is bad.

Rarely used doesn't mean security through obscurity; where'd you read that? Free software is far more secure by design: it's open and subject to public scrutiny, has no secrets, backdoors, unfair competitive advantages via secret APIs, and frequently downstreamed, copied, reused and contributed to, which helps getting it poished. Several layers of security teams work on it, from the original developer of libraries to the final distribution security team.

Any UNIX-like system, not just Linux, has been much more secure and less subject to shameful exploits than Microsoft operating systems partly due to the unnecessary complexity and complication of the later, and partly due to the way Microsoft always neglects security in favour of anything else — which is evident in things such as why it took Windows 21 years (from 1985 Windows 1.0 to 2006 Windows Vista) to finally have a reasonable (albeit extremely flawed) security scheme where grannies don't run as root — 37.5 years after UNIX did.

Security has never been a priority at Microsoft, nor it's never one of its bullet points. As a matter of fact, just one month ago NASA, despite being an American public organization which is always prone to use American contractors as American politicians love to turn public money into private pockets, switched its OSS laptops to GNU/Linux over security concerns.",0,1377503173,null,0,false,0,cbvi40n,t3_1kvfct,t1_cbvi40n,t1_cbtqq5v,null,1429697072,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Of course this is only based on speculation due to the lack of citable sources but i suspect it goes along the following lines:

Germany being the most influential power in the european union and thus shaping their foreign and domestic policies especially in regards to armed conflicts, handling of the economical crisis and stance towards the Arabian Spring revolutions.

Due to a high amount of muslim residents it could be feared by the US to serve as a radicalization platform for extremists. A part of the 9/11 perpetrators lived and planned in Germany.

Protection of Privacy and Data Security are among the big values of Germany so the possibilites of the German Intelligence Agency (BND= Bundesnachrichtendienst literally: federal news services) are limited, so the US could see the German information gathering machine as unsufficient and stepped in to fix this. Also Germany could have requested information they are unable to obtain due to above mentioned restrictions (highly speculative).

There are elections soon in Germany and even though everthing indicates a 3rd term for Merkel it could be useful to know the exact attitude of every party involved towards the US.

As a succesful industrialized and innovative nation Germany is historically a big target for industrial espionage.

A major concentration of internet cables and data centers is in Frankfurt am Main. The majority of all Internet traffic in Europe passes through there. 

Those are more or less the reasons, most likely it is a combination but until we know the nature of the information gathered (political, economical, surveillance of individuals...) it is hard to determine the intentions of the NSA.

Due to much needed reforms, these laws have been relaxed a bit, but the result is that the Chinese *won* in the world where longer hours were a big advantage (hence their dominance in convenience stores, restaurants, etc.).

And to veer off subject a bit, there is a ridiculous belief in Spain that the Chinese can somehow trick the ubiquitous slot machines that you see in every bar and will always win money.  So many Spaniards actually believe this that many places will not allow a Chinese person to play the slots.

You have indeed all rights to have you own opinion, I never contested that.


The dichotomy between rich and healthy capitalist countries  VS starving socialist countries is biased.

First of all, the amount of poor workers in capitalists countries have been increasing dramatically for the last decade.

Secondly, socialism or communism doesn't necessary have to be authoritarian. Of course, stalin was a dictator, and we don't want to repeat that experience !

But if you look for things like libertarian communists, or anarcho-syndicalists, you will find anti-autoritarian non capitalists societies.

We don't have many experiences of such governance in the past. There is one in the revolution of spain in 1936, but it was stopped by Franco 2 years after that.

To get it you'll need your passport and a picture (there are many booths around mMadrid that will take and print the right picture for this case.

With that you can go to the Sol metro station and get your abono in the offices. 

it'll give you unlimited traveling in all transportation systems (bus, metro and ""cercanias"" short-distance trains). It's definitely the best choice for you.

First of all, perversion is more often than not a very religious notion, and refers to everything that is outside of its dogma. Adultery is considered perversion, and more generally sex out of wedlock is considered perversion. I know it's a word often used in the USA because it's a very christian nation, but even if you are religious, you must understand that in the western european more secular society, the concept of perversion is kind of obsolete, as religion doesn't dictate anymore what is wrong or right – society does, thanks to a common sense born from reasonable thinking. It sure still represents a set of arbitrary rules, but they are more logical than the christian, jewish or muslim ones. They can include pedophilia or zoophilia for example, but not homosexuality.

I can't deny there's some LGBT lobbying that try to push paradigms that aren't suitable for a healthy society, and there are some crazy homonazis who are all about ""heteronormativity"" hate, but I must assure you they are very uncommon and should be fought like any other extremist. If you look carefully you won't find many examples of aggressive ""promoting of homosexual lifestyle"" (and if any there's a good chance you're view of it is biased). 

My point is that hate is very easy to identify : ""look, these people do this, so they must be inferior"". It's as simple as that. While perversion is a very subjective notion.

How do GMOs make things ""worse""? For instance GM-cotton is currently making things better for poor indian farmers: http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0064879 When will the making worse start?

""We can do better than this, just many of us don't want to ""

What have you done recently to give food to the poor third world countries? 

""If we grow lots of food and throw most of it away but poverty still exists, developing projects for greater yields does not answer this problem. How could it?""

Simple math, if you grow 2x tons of food, and waste halfe of it, in the end you will have less to eat than when you produce 4x tonns of food and waste half of it. It's not that hard.

And if you take GMOs into account, they are not only based on yield increase. For instance in India half of all fruits and vegetables simply rot before reaching the market. Yet since 1994 we have the technology to prolong the shelf-life of tomatoes, by using this modification it would be possible to dramtically reduce food wasting in India.

Le formaldéhyde, est massivement retrouvé dans les maisons (contribue à l'odeur de neuf, des voitures aussi), en raison des colles, enduits et autres. Les métaux lourds nous sont apportés selon leur nature massivement par les produits de la mer (ou d’élevage), les végétaux etc. Donc, effectivement ""peuvent"" et ""potentiellement"", bref rien de probant.

true,Jonisaurus,EURO,European Union,"&gt;No it isn't. Having to pay more than one's annual income in taxes is absurd.

It's not absurd. There is no work or activity that justifies one person getting billions of dollars. That is perverse wealth. There is a difference between hard/intelligent work and being so lucky and fortunate to earn billions of dollars.

&gt;So basically your greed and jealousy entitles you to violate the property rights of others?

My greed and jealousy? No one is forced to be citizens of countries that have such an ideal. If you want minimal taxes then piss off to other places. But you don't get to keep all the privileges of living in a high tax society.

What you completely ignore and probably don't understand is that society is more than just the sum of all individuals. There is a social balance that needs to be kept otherwise things turn to shit. Societies without large wealth redistribution always end in giant inequality gaps and rich people walling off their properties from the rest of the population. Have fun living in that country.

&gt;Sure there is: they earned it. It's theirs.

Except the type of wealth I'm talking about here is NEVER earned by one person. Money doesn't make anything, you know? There is no productive value to food speculation. Human labour (physical or mental) and natural resources are the source of all production. So if you earn billions of dollars a year not thinking much about it and letting your subordinates deal with everything, what are YOU contributing to society? Seems to me like THAT person is a leech.

There is a point of monetary critical mass where people are able to earn inordinate sums of money whereas others work 50 hours a week with two shitty jobs barely scraping by.

You are entitled to be rewarded for your intelligent decisions, but there is a limit. What you ignore is that not only is the moral ground for having billions of dollars/euros sketchy, such huge income inequality destroys the fabric of society.

As I said earlier... you're free to move to south America and live in a country where rich people build their own towns away from most of the population that is dirt poor. Have fun. I don't want that here.

&gt;The difference between you and the mega-rich is smaller than the difference between you and the global poor. If you want to be consistent in your rhetoric, you realize that you're just as disgustingly wealthy in a global perspective as the mega rich, right?

The general idea of that statement is correct, but I as a person live in the context of my country. There is a harsh limit to what I can do as an individual. I can donate, I can live a reasonable life, which I do because I live off of less than 1000 euros a month and my family doesn't stuff money up my arse, but I can't change the economic system in the world. 

What I CAN do though is support policies that change things for the better in the world. Those are policies that you would never support because you believe everyone's fate is totally in their hands and therefore everyone is at fault for their own well- or not so well-being.

&gt;I can't speak for them but you certainly sound like a greedy parasite.

Cheap and boring insults. The lowest form of argument. You're calling me a greedy parasite because I don't believe everyone's fate is completely self-determined but that there is a large portion of luck involved. I'm a moderate because I'm not at all absolutist. I don't want to make rich people poor or punish them. I just believe their wealth is not just the product of their work but also of their environment, their life's circumstances and luck. And from that belief income redistribution (not everything, rich people can stay rich, just not absurdly rich) is the natural derivation.

It doesn't help that the links he includes as examples of said conventional wisdom don't really make much of an argument about the economic crisis fuelling a sharp rise of the extreme right across Europe. The Transform! link is a case study of Greece, specifically. Moreover, it underlines that ""the economic crisis is certainly not the only explanation for the rise of the far right.""

As for Libya, I suppose that it was deduced that the best way to protect civilians was to expand rebel controlled areas, which mutated into unilateral support as they proved to be rather decent.

Humanitarian intervention sometimes involves overthrowing governments as such. I doubt that will happen in this case though, Assad's forces are much stronger than Gadaffi's were.

No. You're substituting an unreasonable belief for a reasonable one. Everyone agrees that we need reasonable restrictions on who can come and live here.

That's your opinion, and I notice you're not in charge. No, there are activities which merit such levels of pay. How do I know this? Because there are employers willing to pay that sort of salary.

&gt;My greed and jealousy?

Yes, your greed and jealousy. You label salaries larger than some arbitrary standard ""perverse"", for example. 

&gt;If you want minimal taxes then piss off to other places. But you don't get to keep all the privileges of living in a high tax society.

Not wanting to pay more than one's annual income in taxes is not wanting ""minimal taxes"".

&gt;Societies without large wealth redistribution always end in giant inequality gaps and rich people walling off their properties from the rest of the population. Have fun living in that country.

And societies with large wealth redistribution always end in GULAGs and death camps. What fun generalizations are!

&gt;Except the type of wealth I'm talking about here is NEVER earned by one person

So Bill Gates, who inherited no wealth, didn't earn his fortune? 

&gt;Human labour (physical or mental) and natural resources are the source of all production.

Wrong. Capital investment is.

&gt;So if you earn billions of dollars a year not thinking much about it and letting your subordinates deal with everything, what are YOU contributing to society?

Capital investment. Your billions of dollars are on the line. If you fuck up, you lose them.

&gt;What you ignore is that not only is the moral ground for having billions of dollars/euros sketchy

Only according to collectivists like you that wish to impose their arbitrary limits on what others possess because of greed and jealousy. Luckily you're not in charge of many nations and the nations you are in charge of are shitholes that serve as examples to the rest of the world.

&gt;As I said earlier... you're free to move to south America and live in a country where rich people build their own towns away from most of the population that is dirt poor.

And you're free to move to North Korea where the government makes all your decisions for you. I don't see why I have to move and surrender my country to the shitty economic decisions of collectivists. 

&gt;There is a harsh limit to what I can do as an individual.

No, I'm calling you a greedy parasite because you jealously look at the possessions of other people and find ways to justify stealing them. You're a  leech.

Yes you do. You paint a villainous caricature of them, dismissing the notion that their wealth could have been legitimately earned, and support confiscatory taxation.

Which requires that you cede sovereignty to a supranational organisation? 

Absolutely not. I also reject all arguments that people have a hangover from the empire.

&gt; Everyone agrees that we need reasonable restrictions on who can come and live here.

No they do not. What's ""reasonable""? What you consider reasonable is not what somebody else would consider reasonable.

&gt;  But there's a spectrum of views on immigration, and far too many people don't understand the benefits that it has had for us and just want to scrap the whole thing.

Far too many people don't understand the negative consequences it has had for this country and are opposed to tighter controls.

&gt; Here's a tip: If anyone says that decisions are made ""by unelected politicians in Brussels"" that means that they do not understand how the EU works.

I understand the EU perfectly and there's nothing unreasonable about that. The majority of people that make decisions in the EU that relate to Britain are not elected by the British public. They may be elected by other European nations, but this is of little consequence if you think that we should exit the European Union and that British laws should (mostly) be determined by British politicians.

&gt; And yet these are the very people who are supposed to be allowed a vote on it. Laughable.

""Democracy's a bitch"".

&gt; Anyone who has a problem with muslims living in the UK is a bigot and should be deported. Intolerance should not be tolerated.

Well that sounds...how do I put it...rather bigoted and intolerant.

What next? Deport people who think that Islam is a horrible religion? Deport people who use blasphemous language.

In your crusade for tolerance, you inevitably turn into the very antithesis of this. I see this quite often.

&gt; You agree that both papers share the same views. Good, then we have nothing further to discuss about it.

Fortunately for you, we do have more to discuss.

You are insinuating that the Telegraph is racist and xenophobic because it's a Conservative newspaper and there's another ""Conservative"" newspaper that's racist and xenophobic. Weak argument.

&gt; I said that I find hearing outside perspectives on UK-related issues valuable. You responded ""I disagree"".

That's not what you said Mr SoyBean. You said that people outside the UK see thing more clearly. This is a generalisation and I believe inaccurate.

&gt; It doesn't add anything because all you've done is go ""yeah but no"", you haven't explained your position or why I should care. No I'm not going to be convinced by you just stating that you disagree with me.

Let me explain then. I believe it's a generalisation that uses the ""grass is greener"" philosophy of believing that people outside of the UK are able to understand our politics greater than people living here. I would coincidentally say that people outside of the UK have less knowledge of UK politics. I do not believe this makes their viewpoints more ""clear"", yet less informed.

&gt; Half of them are bigots, but all of them are idiots.

All of who? Everybody that disagrees with you are idiots?

&gt; You've seen the survey by Ipsos Mori I presume?

Yes I have.

&gt; And this is our voting populace. 

Once again, this is democracy. It's the same in **every** single democratic nation on Earth. You are misleading yourself into thinking that you live in a country where the people that disagree with you are vicious bigots.

&gt; It's not about opinions here, it's about facts, and they're wrong

It shows that people believe immigrants and non-whites make up a larger percentage of the population than they do. Does that show peoples bigotry? If you live in a city like London you could absolutely be forgiven for thinking that a larger portion of the country are immigrants/non-whites than in reality.

The rockets were good enough to get into space, but not enough to actually travel anywhere (beyond the moon, which is really close from an astronomical point of view). The landers were capable of landing somewhere with very low gravity, but wouldn't have been even remotely able to launch from anything bigger than the moon.

Aside from the milestone of leaving footprints, not that much really happened in the 60's.

Also taking my previous example from my first reply to you: in the former case voice is used as a means to express opinion; in the latter, it is used as a physical mean to physically force someone to be silenced and not be heard.
Of course we live in a physical world and opinions can't be expressed without physical means (i.e. voice, text, etc), but do we really want to start arguing even this? :p

true,SoyBeanExplosion,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Which requires that you cede sovereignty to a supranational organisation?

&gt;Absolutely not. I also reject all arguments that people have a hangover from the empire.

Yes, it does. I hope in the future that Europe will become somewhat like the US as a federal system. By the same logic that we give up certain freedoms by agreeing to obey laws in order to benefit society, we should cede sovereignty to an overarching EU parliament, yes. Otherwise we have no hope of being recognised on an international stage against the US, Russia, China, etc. No EU country on their own can compete with any of them which is why it's important we pull together.

&gt;I understand the EU perfectly and there's nothing unreasonable about that. The majority of people that make decisions in the EU that relate to Britain are not elected by the British public. They may be elected by other European nations, but this is of little consequence if you think that we should exit the European Union and that British laws should (mostly) be determined by British politicians.

Most people do not understand how it works and either way I have no problem with us not having total sovereignty. As I said, there are some of us who who would like to see a somewhat US-like system but with states having more autonomy.

&gt;""Democracy's a bitch"".

People who do not understand the EU should not be allowed to vote on the EU. I don't mind if they disagree with it, but if they don't *understand* it then they should not be allowed a vote on it.

&gt;Well that sounds...how do I put it...rather bigoted and intolerant.

&gt;What next? Deport people who think that Islam is a horrible religion? Deport people who use blasphemous language.

&gt;In your crusade for tolerance, you inevitably turn into the very antithesis of this. I see this quite often.

You are mistaken. It is impossible to be bigoted towards a bigot.

&gt;You are insinuating that the Telegraph is racist and xenophobic because it's a Conservative newspaper and there's another ""Conservative"" newspaper that's racist and xenophobic. Weak argument.

The Daily Mail espouses bigoted, racist, and xenophobic view points. The Telegraph espouses these same viewpoints, therefore it is equally bigoted, racist, and xenophobic. That is my logic.

&gt;That's not what you said Mr SoyBean. You said that people outside the UK see thing more clearly. This is a generalisation and I believe inaccurate.

&gt;     

Let me explain then. I believe it's a generalisation that uses the ""grass is greener"" philosophy of believing that people outside of the UK are able to understand our politics greater than people living here. I would coincidentally say that people outside of the UK have less knowledge of UK politics. I do not believe this makes their viewpoints more ""clear"", yet less informed.

Well that's a fault in my wording so I apologise for that. What I meant is that I appreciate an outside perspective on UK issues, and what I tried to get at is that I find that outsiders sometimes *do* see through some of our local issues more clearly. An outside perspective is always valuable.

&gt;All of who? Everybody that disagrees with you are idiots?

No, these Little Englanders. I have respect for people who understand an issue, for example the EU, but disagree with me. No problem with that. I have no respect for people who have opinions on things they do not understand.

&gt;You are misleading yourself into thinking that you live in a country where the people that disagree with you are vicious bigots.

They are not bigots *because* they disagree with me. They are bigots solely because of their views as expressed through the Ipsos Mori poll.

&gt;Once again, this is democracy. It's the same in every single democratic nation on Earth. You are misleading yourself into thinking that you live in a country where the people that disagree with you are vicious bigots.

Not so. Germany and most of Northern Europe has a voting population far more in tune with the reality of issues.

They mention it because that's the whole point? People who are descendant of Germans, as opposed to Poles, who lived within today's borders of Poland at a time when Poland was elsewhere.

""Elsewhere"" is to be taken literally btw. After WWII, the USSR annexed the Eastern part of Poland's old territory and Poland got some land in Eastern Germany to make up for it. Some of this land had been German and inhabited by Germans for hundreds of years. There's a reason why Prussia was named for a tribe that originally inhabited the area to the East of the river Vistula in Eastern Poland.

(In this context, ""German"" doesn't necessarily refer to a German state, but to the general group of tribes and peoples that are considered German now.)

true,JayKayAu,AUST,Australia,"I just want to point something out that our American friends sometimes forget: *Absolute* freedom of speech is *not actually a good thing*. 

Freedom of speech is *generally*, most of the time, under normal circumstances, a wonderful thing. Yay, let's all be free to say what we want! We definitely want to be standing on the *freedom* end of the spectrum. The other end of the spectrum (like North Korea) is not a pretty place. Not at all.

Anyone from a developed country would agree with this. Freedom is mostly a great thing.

***BUT*** be very, very, *very* careful when you decide to do something *absolutely*, with no exceptions.

When you push this idea of ""freedom"" of speech *to the extreme*, you start to get some very, very nasty problems pop up. 

Some examples:

 - Alice copies Bob's work, and sells it as if it were hers. (copyright)
 - Bob claims Charlie is a child molester. (defamation, slander)
 - Charlie sells Dianne fake artwork claiming it as original (counterfeiting)
 - Diane runs a business and knowingly misleads her customer, Ernie. (trade practices)
 - Ernie hates a minority group, and organises anti-minority rallies against them. (hate speech, incitement)

If we have *absolute* freedom of speech, you can never solve these problems. Ever. People can cheat, lie, and slander, and incite with absolute impunity. *Absolute* freedom means that there are *no (legal) consequences*. Because if you're free to do anything, then the law has nothing to say.

So there are *always* going to be a class of situations where what you say (or do) *MUST* carry consequences.

That means we will never (regardless of what country we're in), have *absolute* freedom of speech. Our speech will be limited in some way or form regardless. And that's both a necessary and a *good* thing.

So what we're *really* talking about here is *where* do we draw the line of freedom of speech?

At the moment, America is *pretending* that freedom of speech is absolute. It's not. That's a delusion. (Try making a bomb joke at an airport.)

Other developed countries don't bother pretending, but instead are honest about where the limit is. There's a limit, there's got to be a limit, so let's talk about it like adults.

So forget about ""freedom of speech"". Let's talk instead about the limits of speech. Where are they? Where should they be? What's okay? What's not okay?

&gt; Angela Merkel's main rival in the German general election next month has pledged to suspend EU-US trade talks over the National Security Agency spying scandal if he replaces her as chancellor.

&gt; In a further sign that the NSA row has soured relations between the US and its European allies, Peer Steinbrück, leader of the Social Democratic party, told ARD TV: ""I would interrupt the negotiations until the Americans say if German government offices and European institutions are bugged or wiretapped. We don't know if the Americans may be sitting under our desks with some technical devices."" He pledged to press Washington about the spy agency's activities before continuing with the talks about a transatlantic free trade agreement.

&gt; His move comes after Germany's Der Spiegel weekly reported that the NSA bugged the United Nations' New York headquarters, with the European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency among those targeted.

&gt; Der Spiegel said files obtained by whistleblower Edward Snowden showed that the NSA spied on the EU in New York after it moved to new rooms in autumn 2012 and that the NSA runs a bugging programme in more than 80 embassies and consulates worldwide called the ""Special Collection Service"", which has ""little or nothing to do with warding off terrorists"".

&gt; Other files cited in the report describe how the NSA managed to access the UN's video conferencing system and crack its security.

&gt; Snowden's revelations about the NSA have plunged privacy-conscious Germany into outrage during the campaign for the election on 22 September. Distrust of the government's handling of the surveillance scandal threatens to damage Merkel's bid to retain the chancellorship.

&gt; Earlier this month, her government attempted to reassure voters that US and British intelligence agencies had observed German laws in Germany. But critics remained sceptical, pointing out that would not stop foreign agencies accessing German online communication data transferred to the US-based servers of Google, Facebook or Microsoft.

&gt; At a recent rally, the chancellor struggled to make herself heard over chants of ""hypocrite"" and ""liar"" and the sound of vuvuzelas being blown by opponents worried about stories of American snooping.

&gt; Germany's independent privacy watchdogs say the surveillance programmes run by the NSA breach an EU-US pact meant to ensure cross-border data protection. ""We're just at the beginning of the debate,"" Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the Social Democrats said on Friday. ""The assurances ... do not refer to data taken from American servers.""

Yea, weirdos exist and have weird theories. Imagine how many people Brevik could have killed, if he had the financial support of Christian extremists from the US, who, in turn, would be protected by a military superpower.

&gt; What could India possibly have to do with Pakistani Sunnis slaughtering Shias??? You're desperate to blame anybody and everybody for the crimes of Islam except Muslims themselves!

You keep taking stuff totally out of context. There are customs (FGM) and local rivalries (Pakistan) that exist alongside Islam. Islam is a culture as much as a religion and mixes with local customs. Which is why I compared it to saying Christianity is responsible for Hitler. Hitler was Christian. So is a large part of Europe now. But that's about it. There are other reasons why Hitler did what he did. Same with the conflict in Pakistan, which has it's roots in the history of the Indian subcontinent. So I told you to look at the history of India. You know, India and Pakistan weren't always divided. 

&gt; You're implying that there was no basis in Islamic tradition for extremism....that it was somehow an accident that was imported from the West. Whatever the sins of the West (and there have been many), Islam was ALWAYS extreme....and your attribution of Western responsibility is a manifestation of self-hatred.

Dude, whatever you think of Islam also applies the Christianity and the Jews. There isn't such a big difference. You can take anything to the extreme. Or to the mellow. Like I wrote in an earlier comment about Japanese Buddhists. When it came to WWII there wasn't anything mellow about their Buddhism. And Christianity and Islam aren't that different. 

What the West did is use extremists for their purpose. And support some backwater kingdom for oil. Backwater kingdom then exportet their extreme nutcase version of Islam (could be Christianity, it is completely replaceable). And now we have what we have.

I'm serious. The current level of traffic is unsustainable in the long term.

&gt; How would you do that?

First, I would shift subsidies. [A study](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/studie-steuerzahler-muessen-autoverkehr-subventionieren-/7838564.html) has concluded that the taxpayer subsidizes cars and trucks with 85 to 90 billion euros a year. For comparison: In 2012, the railway system got 2,5 billion euros in subsidies for the network and 7 billion for regional trains. DB had to pay out 500 million as dividend, therefore the total expenditure to the taxpayer was 9 billion euros. 

Now, you need to remember where driving is efficient, and where it is inefficient. Driving from small village A to small village B 20 km away is efficient because there are only a few people doing it per day. Driving from Hamburg to Munich is inefficient, though, because a lot of people want to do the same. Same goes for driving in central Berlin.

Therefore, a system needs to be developed that allows driving from small village A to small village B with relatively little cost, but makes driving from Hamburg to Munich expensive. You could have dynamic pricing, or just introduce a toll for the Autobahn and for central areas of cities. Or, alternatively, you could just make driving less comfortable and save on maintenance by imposing a speed limit on the Autobahn and reducing capacities in inner cities.

For reducing total traffic, that's more of a question of city planning. For a long time, separation has been standard in city planning: You had your living areas, your industry areas, your shopping areas and so on. Now this makes sense in some regard, you wouldn't want a chemical plant in your backyard, but an office building can be next to apartments, and grocery shopping can be done in small supermarkets on the ground floor of apartment buildings.

But again, it's a question of subsidies and infrastructure: As long as it's easy and cheap to ship the groceries to a shopping center out of town, and every single customer driving their car from their home in the town to the shopping center, instead of shipping the groceries to local providers and people getting them by foot, traffic will be generated.

Once again, the false equivalence here is this: Brevik was a single individual who represented no one's views but his own, which were essentially the psychotic musings of a madman, while Islamic fundamentalists number in the millions and have a definitive theological rational to regulate their behavior....which would and DOES exist regardless of the actions of the West. These pathologies (violence, stonings, FGM) didn't appear out of the blue - as Brevik's illness did, they are time-honored traditions that go back to the first generation of Muslims and the teachings of Muhammad. To blame them on the West is a blatant example of displacement of responsibility. I don't know why this is so hard for you to comprehend?
 
&gt;Hitler

Hitler was BORN a Christian....but he had NO fidelity at all to the religion as a belief system. I would liken him to Saddam Hussein, who was BORN a Muslim, but who was motivated by nationalism, socialism, and most of all, personal aggrandizement. But Bin Ladin, the Wahhabis, the Salafists, their actions are motivated EXCLUSIVELY by their interpretation of - and fidelity to - Islam. They didn't learn their behavior from the West. It emanates from THEIR OWN TRADITIONS!!!

&gt;India....Pakistan....local cultures....weren't always divided...

Yes, I know ALL ABOUT the history of India. I've studied it extensively. Did you know that the first Islamic incursions occurred in the 10th century, that the conquest was on-going for the next 700 years, that some demographers claim that upwards of 80 million Hindus were slaughtered over that time period, that the slaughter is documented mostly in Islamic triumphalist literature, and that the Muslims finally conferred the status of dhimmi on the polytheistic Hindus because the latter were simply too numerous to exterminate? The great historian Will Durant referred to the Muslim conquest of India as ""perhaps the bloodiest chapter in human history"". Did you know any of this???

&gt;Dude, whatever you think of Islam also applies the Christianity and the Jews. There isn't such a big difference.

If you weren't so intellectually slothful, you might engage in some theological study and discover that the ethos of Jesus, as portrayed in the gospel, and the ethos of Muhammad, as promulgated in the Quran &amp; Hadith, couldn't be more contrasting.

But no, you're not interested in the historiography, in the theology, in the empirical evidence...you have your simplistic, vapid multicultural mantras to live by....repeating by rote what the culture has programmed you to think, that all religions are the same, all cultures are the same, etc, etc. It's tantamount to saying all ideas are the same, which even a relativist like you would protest against.

BOTTOM LINE: Christianity is not perfect....no religion is. Christians have done some horrible things in this life. But by and large, they've done so in CONTRAVENTION to the teachings of Christ. Muslims who wage bloody Jihad, who stone adulteresses, who mutilate the genitals of their daughters, do so in COMPLIANCE with the teachings of Muhammad.

20 bis 25 sollen die Veranstaltung gestürmt haben. Da die Kamera während der Störung nur die Bühne im Blick hatte, ist es kein Kunststück, die anderen Personen nicht zu sehen.

Ja, da müsste die Bühne schon weit definiert werden, um auch acht zu kommen.

&gt;Durch die Angreifer wurde im Bereich der Bühne Pfefferspray eingesetzt.

Es mag kein Pfefferspray gewesen sein - möglich. Aber es wird im Video hörbar, dass mehre Personen laut husten und eine Verwechslung von *Reizgas* mit Pfefferspray ist im Bereich des Nachvollziehbaren.

Der Autor versteift sich auch darauf, dass einer der beiden Personen auf der Bühne Pfefferspray eingesetzt haben soll. Das das aber gar nicht Voraussetzung ist, übersieht er.

true,[deleted],null,null,"""meaning if we later discover a fault in this gene ie bees dyin, then too late this gene has spread all over.""

Actually Cry genes, which encode Bt toxins were isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria. These are insect pathogenic bactera, which live in the soil and on plants. So these genes have been spread all over the environment for millions of years, we found them in nature. We can not contain them, because these genes were widespread long before we even used stone axes.   
And its's funny you are fixed on CCD (colony collapse disorder) so much, as it is a prime example how much harm anti-GMO campaigning can do. You see, in te 90' there was a GM-potato, resistant to colorado beetle. Famers wanted to plant it, but anti-GMO activists made such a fus about it, that they eventually dropped it altogather, and used imidacloprid instead, a new pesticide which was extremely effective against colorado beetle. Fast forward a few years, bee populations are declining, but not beacuse of GM crops, the main suspect is imidacloprid, which was favored because it's not a GM plant, but a pesticide. So by favoring a solution with wide toxicity (imidacloprid) instead of a solution with extremely narrow toxicity (GM-crops) we are killing the bees, when a completely bee-freindly solution is within reach, only we do not want to use it, as it's GMO. So if you are worried about bees, the least you could to is to stop opposing GMOs and let farmers use the bee-friendly crops.

""There are ways to safeguard against this, in a heavily regulated industry that is more socially conscious than purely profit driven.""

Such as? 

""If you have 2 tonnes of food and waste 1, and others have 0, you having 4 tonnes means you waste 3, and others still have none. It's very simple.""

You have surely heard about something called the free market? You know, a place where food can be bought for a magical thing called money. The more food circulates on the market, the cheaper it will be, the cheaper the food, more people will be able to buy it.

""You hear about all the Indian farmers who have to buy seeds every harvest coz they've been coded to be infertile.""

Many many lies are spread on the Internet. You see, Monsanto has a patent on a terminator technology, however they never used it in any commercially available product. ( http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/terminator-seeds.aspx ) So this is a simple lie. Coincidentally, you can readily buy seedless watermelons, which are triploid or in your words ""coded to be infertile"" and farmers growing it have to buy the seeds every year, but it is not considered to be GMO so noone tries to ban it.

What you are refering to is hybrid seed technology, which has been used for a century and has been used exclusively for four-five decades.  This technology has nothing to do with GMOs. http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/timeline/corn.htm
So if you think this is socially detrimental, why do we not feel its effects? This technology has been used since the time of your grandfather was born. 

So if you want to help poor indian farmers, simply do not protest against GMOs. As you can see, there are many studies, which conclude, that by planting GM-cotton, poor indian farmers actually earn more. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871678410005364

So please try to learn something about the thing you protest against, anti-GMO arguments are littered with lies, misconceptions and simple urban legends. The reality is that GM crops are not more dangerous than conventional ones, are environmentally friendly and can help the poor farmers the most as they can be used without any large investment (machinery, pesticides, etc.).

Si tu veux, je t'explique le sens. Mais il faut arrêter de prêter à l'Église des intentions qui n'existent pas.

&gt;on en est plus là socialement et l'Eglise n'a pas encore compris qu'il fallait que son modèle change

L'Église change constamment et s'adapte, tu as dû louper quelques événements. Par contre elle n'est pas dans l'éphémère. Son échelle de temps, c'est la génération. Elle a de la mémoire et ne subit pas les caprices du temps présent. L'Église a compris qu'elle devait représenter la morale, qui est bien mise à mal dans notre société individualiste de consommation.

&gt;il fallait qu'elle vende Saint Pierre et toutes les terres consacrées et qu'elle utilise l'argent des ventes pour participer à la recherche médicale et créer des missions laïques.

Le vendre à qui ? Pour construire quoi à la place ? Un centre commercial ou un bâtiment occupé par des banquiers ... symbole du culte de l'argent ? Pour le plaisir de détruire un monument historique et les millénaires d'histoire qu'il représente ? L'Église est responsable de garder ce patrimoine de l'humanité en bon état.

Pour le coup des organisations laïques, je t'ai déjà mis le lien des caritas... Ça existe déjà et ça marche très bien : ces organisations aident 24 millions de personnes par an. La lutte contre le SIDA ""à la chrétienne"", c'est à dire en promouvant la réduction du nombre de partenaires sexuels, marche bien mieux que le fait de distribuer des capotes.

Enfin, l'argent seul ne suffit pas. La connaissance seule ne suffit pas. Il faut de l'âme et de l'éthique, une philosophie de vie. C'est ça qui manque, et c'est ça que l'Église fournit.

En fait, tu voudrais que l'Église soit irréprochable, et qu'elle résolve toute seule tous les problèmes du monde ! Et bien non, c'est une organisation humaine, et comme tous les êtres humains ont des défauts, l'Église a des défauts. De plus, comme toute institution ayant eu un pouvoir politique important, elle comporte des contradictions liées à l'exercice de l'autorité.

Ce n'est pas à l'Église de changer la nature humaine. Elle propose un chemin de sainteté, où tu réfléchis au but de tes actes et à leurs effets sur les autres. 

C'est très proche d'un platonisme déiste et je trouve ça très adapté à notre société où le modèle est censé être un jouisseur capricieux et insatiable qui ne vit que dans l'instant et la consommation de biens, d'autrui et de soi.",0,1377533898,null,0,1377539177,0,cbvo2sz,t3_1kqss5,t1_cbvo2sz,t1_cbux0jv,null,1429694209,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

true,Britzer,GERM,Germany,"You keep making up this weird conspiracy theory as if Muslims were some bloodthirsty religion totally different from all the others. This is simply not true. It is very similar to the other religions. And the biggest similarity ...

&gt; If you weren't so intellectually slothful, you might engage in some theological study and discover that the ethos of Jesus, as portrayed in the gospel, and the ethos of Muhammad, as promulgated in the Quran &amp; Hadith, couldn't be more contrasting.

... is that most of it's followers have no idea about theology. Best example is the US. Many if not a majority of Americans consider themselves Christians. But Jesus Christ himself said that rich people don't get into heaven and that you should never make war, even if attacked. The US is very rich. Everyone strives to be rich. They are very materialistic. And they are, by far, the biggest military machine humankind has ever seen. They take pride in carrying weapons. 

So: The majority of Christians usually do the opposite of what Jesus Christ taught. What the theology of Christianity is. 

So what if you interpret something into Islam? Many Muslims probabely can't even read. They consider themselves Muslim, because that is what you do where they live. Just like we, in the West, drive cars. Or consider ourselves Europeans. Ask a European what it means for him to be European. Or ask a Muslim what Islam acutally means to them. Or what the deeper theology behind it is. Most of them will either give you no answer or something they learned verbatim, which has no meaning to them beyond the mere words memorized. I would argue that to most Muslims the faith is a lot like the color of their skin. They wear the headscarf, because others do, too. If all men in Europe would start to wear skirts and talk about the morality of wearing skirts, I think it would really catch on. No matter if you personally would see anything to it. 

&gt; Yes, I know ALL ABOUT the history of India. 

So you know that Hindus and Muslims have been killing each other for a long time? Why would that all be the fault of Islam?

&gt; But you'll never grasp it. Your cultural programming has been too comprehensive. 

You are a racist. Instead of the color of the skin you chose another abritrary thing and attach bad meaning to it. But that's no biggy. A lot of people are racist.

Iraq has had more casualties in July 2013 than any time in the last decade even during the height of the ""insurgency"". Over 1,000 people have been killed in July in Shia/Sunni Sectarian Fighting/bombings/ambushes/etc

Lebanon is on the brink of an all-out civil war between Shia's and Sunni's after two major car bomb attacks in the last few weeks. One aimed at the Hezbollah headquarters which killed over 40 people and one aimed at a Sunni mosque last week which killed about the same amount of people.

This civil war will soon engulf Syria/Lebanon/Iraq and like i said, NATO bombing will ONLY escalate this to all-out war. Hezbollah is on the brink already of declaring all-out war in Syria/Lebanon and the same goes for the Iraqi Shia's.

Mutations, useful, indifferent and negative, happen all the time regardless of inbreeding: we produce a copy of our DNA at each cell division, and although this copying process is astonishingly faithful, mistakes are made.

However, in our [genotype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype) we carry two alleles, that is, two copies of each gene, one in each chromosome of a pair of chromosomes. Depending on [dominance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics) ), one or the other allele (or both) will be expressed in our [phenotype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype). Moreover, in sexual reproduction, the cards are shuffled: in each pair of chromosomes, one comes from the father and the other one from the mother. Therefore, if just the father had one mutated allele, the chances of the son inheriting it are 1:2, and the chances of the mutated allele actually expressing itself in the son's phenotype are even more reduced, depending on dominance. In successive generations, barring new contributions of the mutated allele into the bloodline, the mutation will be further diluted and eventually disappear from the bloodline. This is, of course, where selective breeding, inbreeding, or natural selection come into play by ""stacking the deck"": any of these increases the chances of mating with a partner carrying the same mutated allele and producing ""true-breeding"" offspring with mutated alleles in both paternal and maternal chromosomes. But even then, the chances of producing such ""true breeding"" offspring are just 1:4.

What I take that to mean is that you can't enforce a state on a bunch of disparate groups without first bringing them closer together via diplomacy. It's the huge mistake that the U.S. made in Iraq- they completely eliminated the Baathist state that had ruled over Iraq for decades, and attempted to replace it without having the support, or even opening up dialogue, with the many different sectarian groups in the country. 

Syria is so chaotic right now, and there's sooo many groups that are controlling areas of the country where the Syrian state has retreated, it seems like any Western countries that intervene in Syria could be bogged down for years, and faced with a similar problems to what the U.S. faced in our attempt at state-building in Iraq. 

I think the West, and particularly my country, the United States, needs to come to terms with our impotency when it comes to building states out of chaos in the Middle-East, and that can be hard to come to terms with when we see all the death and destruction happening over there- we instinctively want to do something to stop it.  

Sure, we can invade countries and easily topple governments, stuff like that, but state-building is not really something any Western country is equipped to do effectively at this point, IMO. There's a good chance we just make the situation worse if we're not careful. This looks like a big mistake.

E' tutta questione di COME SI VIENE EDUCATI, se i genitori ti insegnano la differenza tra realtà e la finzione che si vede nei videogiochi e film, la differenza tra bene e male, allora capirai che tentando di imitare quello che vedi in TV prima o poi ti farai male o farai male a qualcun'altro. Magari a 6 anni vedevo i protagonisti dei videogiochi o dei film come eroi, ma era la stessa cosa che pensavo dei protagonisti dei cartoni animati come Dragon Ball, ma mica ho mai pensato di poter volare come Goku...

Es gibt viele Varianten der Marktwirtschaft und Kapitalismus ist nur eine davon.

Statt Besitz durch Geld (= Anspruch auf Leistung oder Waren anderer) kann man Besitz auch an Arbeit und Teilhabe koppeln, zum Beispiel durch belegschaftsgeführte Betriebe oder genossenschaftliche Banken und Wohnbauten. Kapitalanhäufung innerhalb reicher Familien könnte vermieden werden indem man wieder eine annehmbar hohe Erbschaftssteuer einführt. Die Infrastruktur zur Grundversorgung (Wasser, Strom, Verkehr, Gesundheitssystem, Sicherheit, Bildung, geförderter Wohnraum) gehört grundsätzlich in die Hand des Volkes, weil diese Güter zu wertvoll sind um sie denjenigen zu überlassen die Geld haben. Banken haben sich vollkommen neu erfunden und erbringen Dienstleistungen die mit der Realwirtschaft nur noch so schwach verknüpft sind, dass die globale Geldmenge (= Anspruch auf Waren und Dienstleistungen) die erbrachte Arbeit um ein vielfaches überschreitet. Mit voranschreitender Automatisierung können immer weniger Arbeiter in immer kürzerer Zeit immer mehr Güter produzieren, doch statt die freigewordenen Ressourcen über Steuern abzuschöpfen in benötigte Dienstleistungen wie Bildung, Kinderbetreuung, Altenpflege, Umweltschutz und Forschung zu investieren fließt der Überschuss in die Taschen derjenigen die schon haben. Hier beißt uns die EU in den Hintern, den Abwanderung wegen Gewinnschmälerung könnte man mit Zöllen effektiv unterbinden, oder Großbetriebe per Gesetz dazu zwingen der öffentlichen Hand bei jeder Betriebsverkleinerung ein Vorkaufsrecht für die abzustoßenden Unternehmensteile einzuräumen.

true,almodozo,null,null,"&gt; Most ""far-right"" parties in Europe in my experience just want to cut down on immigration.

Depends greatly from country to country. Here in Hungary, the far right is more concerned with Gypsies, Jews and gays than with immigrants; the Bulgarian Attack! party is mostly anti-Turkish (and the Turkish minority there is centuries-old, not the result of immigration); the Romanian far right, through the decade or two of its success, was about distrust of Hungarians and Jews; etc. In addition, in all these cases, the far right didn't only benefit from whipping up of resentment against domestic minorities, but also from public disgust with corruption which chimed well with its rhetorics about parasitic elites, and populist campaigns on law and order and economic policy.

That's not just an East-European thing either. The French National Front, before its attempts in this decade to clean up its image, was associated with anti-semitism as well as anti-immigration feeling, and of course populist law and order campaigns. Same goes for Austria's far right, which had an unpleasant habit of trying to make the country's WW2 past seem more innocuous than it was. The German NPD, successful at state level if not at national level, covers the whole neo-nazi spectrum of ideological positions.

So no, I would not say that the only thing that sets the far-right parties apart from other parties is their resistance to immigration. Though obviously the way they frame the need to cut down on immigration is one thing that sets them apart; it's hardly just about proposing some policy change.

The Romanian far-right has had a long time to discredit itself, and it's worth to note that PPDD essentially replaces PRM (~20% in 2000 and ~12% in 2004), whose success was also due to populist rather than nationalist reasons. 2008 was at the top of a good period financially, and mindless populism lost traction.

true,Paladin8,null,null,"Was tun? BGE einführen. Wie finanzieren? So:

400 € BGE im Monat für jeden, vom Kind bis zum Greis. Kostet 385 Mrd. € im Jahr.  
Dazu Mietbeihilfe im Bedarfsfall, Einzelperson bis 400 €, danach gestaffelt. Dafür setze ich 35 Mrd. € im Jahr an, was etwa der Hälfte der Ausgaben für ALG II, Grundsicherung, Sozialhilfe, Wohngeld und BAFöG entspricht.  
Finanziert werden müssen also 420 Mrd. € im Jahr.

1. BGE Steuer in Höhe von 25% auf alle Einkommen bis 18.400 € im Jahr (1.600 € im Monat). Der maximale Steuerbetrag beträgt 400 € im Monat, man zahlt also gerade sein BGE zurück. Als ich das durchrechnete habe ich aus allen möglichen Quellen, primär destatis, Daten zur Einkommensverteilung zusammengetragen und bin auf folgende Einnahmeschätzungen gekommen:  
Arbeitseinkommen 175 Mrd. €  
Renten 40 Mrd. €  
Pensionen 10 Mrd. €  
Lohnfortzahlungen 7+ Mrd. €  
Gesamteinnahmen ohne Kapitaleinkünfte, Miet- und Pachteinnahmen, Beamtenbezüge, Arbeitslosengeld I und sonstige Einkommen: 232+ Mrd. €

2. Abschaffung folgender Sozialleistungen da durch BGE und Mietbeihilfe ersetzt:  
Kindergeld 34 Mrd. €  
ALG II 32 Mrd. €  
Sozialhilfe 25 Mrd. €  
Grundsicherung 4 Mrd. €  
BAFöG 3 Mrd. €  
Wohngeld 2 Mrd. €  
Gesamteinsparungen ohne Waisenrente, einmalige Sozialleistungen, Asylantenunterbringung und sonstige Beihilfen: 100 Mrd. €

3. Abschaffung großer Verwaltungsapperate:  
Schwer abzuschätzen. Im allgemeinen kann man bei öffentlichen Körperschaften von einem Verwaltungskostenanteil von 5% ausgehen, ausgehend von 2) würde ich also 5 Mrd. € ansetzen.

4. Einführung eines allg. Mindestlohns von 5 € pro Stunde für ungelernte Tätigkeiten und 7 € für gelernte Tätigkeiten: 5 bis 10 Mrd. €  
Die Zahlen hatte ich noch von älteren Studien im Hinterkopf, deshalb kann ich hierfür nur Schätzungen abgeben. Die Ersparnisse dürften aber eher noch höher sein, da die potenziellen staatlichen Leistungen ja auch höher sind. Für die Berechnung unten nehme ich mal 5 Mrd. € an.

5. Mehreinnahmen durch Mehrkonsum.  
Zieht man von den 420 Mrd. € Ausgaben die Punkte 1 bis 3 ab, so bleiben staatliche Mehrausgaben von ca. 90 Mrd. € die sehr wahrscheinlich zu einem großen Teil direkt wieder reinvestiert werden (arme Leute verkonsumieren praktisch ihr komplettes Budget). Bei einer Staatsquote von knapp 45% würden so auf dem einen oder anderen Weg 40 Mrd. € Mehreinnahmen in die öffentlichen Haushalte gespült werden.

6. Steuermehreinnahmen durch wegfallende Freibeträge  
Durch das BGE können einige Steuervergünstigungen entfallen, insbesondere der Kinderfreibetrag bei der Einkommenssteuer. Hierzu habe ich kaum Daten gefunden, grob überschlagen gehe ich von einem Betrag um die 10 Mrd. € im Jahr aus der zusätzlich eingenommen wird (12 Mio. Kinder und Jugendliche, bei 2/3 wird der Freibetrag ausgenutzt, Durchschnittssteuersatz 20% =&gt; 8 Mio. * 7000 € * 0,2 = 11 Mrd. €).

7. Mehrwertsteuerreform  
Der ermäßigte Mehrwertsteuersatz wird auf 9% angehoben und gilt nur noch für Nahrungsmittel, Wasser, Säfte, Bücher und ÖPNV. Gleichzeitig wird der allgemeine Mehrwertsteuersatz auf 18% gesenkt. Zusätzlich wird ein erhöhter Mehrwertsteuersatz von 27% eingeführt, der auf (Zier)Waren aus Edelmetallen und andere teure Rohstoffe wie Marmor und Tropenhölzer, Rennpferde, Fahrzeuge oberhalb eines gewissen Energieverbrauchs u.ä. erhoben wird.  
Die Senkung des allg. Mehrwertsteuersatzes kostet 6 Mrd. €, die Abschaffung von Ausnahmen bringt 7 Mrd. €, die Anhebung des verminderten Satzes bringt 3 Mrd. €, die Einführung des erhöhten Satzes bringt 1+ Mrd. € =&gt; 5+ Mrd. € Mehreinnahmen

**Abrechnung:**  
420 Mrd. € Mehrausgaben  
232+ + 100 + 5 + 5 + 40 + 10 + 5+ = 397++ Mrd. Mehreinnahmen oder Einsparungen
___________
~20 Mrd. € Finanzierungslücke

Ich wage zu behaupten dass das durch die noch nicht berücksichtigen Einnahmen aus Beamtenbezügen, Kapitaleinnahmen, ALG I und sonstigen Lohnfortzahlungen, den Einsparungen bei Waisenrente, einmaligen Sozialleistungen, Asylantenunterbringung und sonstigen Hilfeleistungen sowie den abgerundeten Beträgen bei Mehreinnahmen oder Einsparungen durch Mehrkonsum, Mindestlohn und Mehrwertsteuer finanzieren lässt.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; So what we're really talking about here is where do we draw the line of freedom of speech?

Agreed. The classic American example of this is ""You can't yell ""FIRE"" in a crowded theater"", due mainly to an unfortunate incident where a number of people died as a result of being trampled. 

I'm definitely not an authority on this, but our limits include prohibitions against harming someones reputation *untruthfully* through slander or libel, and of course, making direct *credible* threats of violence against someone. There is more to it, but the biggest difference (with some of Europe) is that you don't have the right to not be offended by something someone says. 

This last is unfortunately changing with the politically correct crowd. One of the most extreme examples of this is the prohibition (in some areas) against speaking about ""Black Holes"", as this astronomical phenomenon can be deemed racist against black people. Perhaps the US is adopting a perverted version of European speech limits, because ""being offended"" appears to be a new pastime in some segments of the population.

Ahhh, but they have the literate Imams to help them comprehend Islam....exhorting them on Friday prayers to kill the ""enemies of Allah""...to mutilate the genitals of their daughters, etc,. 

Interesting that ""lack of education"" is one of the typical leftist memes to attempt to exonerate Islam from the actions of Muslims, but that in point of fact, most radical Islamists are indeed educated, many at the university level. All the professional guilds of Egypt during Mubarak's reign - lawyers, doctors, engineers, elected IslamIST leadership.

&gt;So you know that Hindus and Muslims have been killing each other for a long time? Why would that all be the fault of Islam? 

I'm sooooo glad you asked this question. It is incontrovertible evidence of your complete and utter ignorance! Let me explain to the hapless pupil....

Why would the killing in India ""all be the fault of Islam""? 

BECAUSE IT WAS THE MUSLIMS WHO INVADED INDIA!!! If you knew anything at all about history, you'd know that the 'Mogul Empire' and 'the 'Sultanate of Delhi' were MUSLIM EMPIRES in the Hindu heartland! There were no Hindu conquests or even incursions into the Islamic heartland! The overwhelming percentage of those killed in the 800 years of Muslim conquest of India were HINDUS!!! Only a myopic leftist like yourself could possibly insist that the two parties are equally responsible for the killing....(the fact that in the last 65 years, Hindus have been finally able to fight back doesn't change the historical backdrop in any way....and if you think it does, you have no conception of time in a historical context).

Now, watch as you completely ignore the argument I've just made because you know I'm right and you have no functional counter-argument!

&gt;You are a racist. Instead of the color of the skin you chose another abritrary thing and attach bad meaning to it

You're not even aware of the utterly contradictory essence of that assertion. You call me a racist, but then you concede my concerns have nothing to do with skin color. 

But the most ridiculous part is the assertion that my concerns about Islamic extremism are ""arbitrary"". There have been over 21,000 religiously-motivated terrorist attacks since 9-11 (thereligionofpeace.com) killing hundreds of thousands of people. Honor killings and FGM continue to proliferate, even into Europe. Religious minorities continue to endure systematic violence and legalized discrimination in many parts of the Islamic world.

But my concerns are ""arbitrary"", eh?

Absolutely false. The only ones responsible for a crime are those who perpetrated it. 

What I AM trying to get across your thick and sluggish intellect is that there are commonalities to the behavior of Muslims EVERYWHERE, based upon the theological traditions of the faith. Let me elaborate...

You seem to think that the Muslims of Europe are entirely DIFFERENT than what you call the ""nutcases"" in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm trying to tell you that's not necessarily the case. FGM is practiced in North Africa and parts of the Middle East....and TODAY, it is ALSO practiced by some Muslim immigrants in Europe. Honor killings occur mostly in the Middle East and South Asia, but they've ALSO begun to occur among Muslim immigrants in Europe. Jihadi terrorism is endemic to the Middle East, Southwest Asia, and North Africa, but it's also occurring among Muslim immigrants in Europe (London, Madrid, Beslan, the British soldier recently beheaded).

You delude yourself into believing this is all accidental or incidental. I'm telling you it is part of a historical pattern of behavior. I'm NOT asking that you hate Muslims, I'm merely suggesting that you acknowledge that maybe, just MAYBE, there are patterns of behavior that are specific to the Muslim community and that warrant our attention. But even THAT is too much to expect from a mindless leftist like yourself.....because to acknowledge that culture and religion actually influences the behavior of people jeopardizes your multicultural fantasy that everyone is identical. 

&gt;everything that is happening in the Muslim world, including Syria, is totally relaxed.

&gt; Il passaporto è una garanzia da parte di uno Stato di prendere responsabilità per una certa persona classificata come ""cittadino"".

Assolutamente no. Il passaporto è un semplice documento di identità che uno stato rilascia per certificare l'identità e la cittadinanza di una persona. Eventuali accordi riguardo ai crimini commessi dai propri cittadini in territorio straniero sono regolati da trattati internazionali, non sono impliciti nel rilascio di un passaporto.

&gt; Se sta gente ha una nazionalità, i costi processuali, di incarcerazione e di danneggiamento sono a carico dello Stato tutelante.

Solo se la cosa è stipulata da un trattato internazionale. Inoltre, anche nei casi in cui lo fosse, i luoghi di provenienza degli immigrati clandestini spesso hanno strutture statali e finanziarie talmente fallimentari che sperare di ottenere un rimborso dei costi carcerari è irrealistico.

&gt; e sta gente arriva in Italia senza passaporto, la si manda via.

Ma la grande maggioranza dei clandestini arriva inizialmente in Italia con tutti i documenti perfettamente in regola. Ti cito [un sunto di wikipedia basato su dati del Ministero dell'Interno](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrazione_illegale#L.27immigrazione_illegale_in_Italia): il 60% dei clandestini è entrato legalmente in Italia ma rimane oltre la durata del proprio permesso, mentre un ulteriore 25% entra attraverso i confini europei e non ha quindi bisogno di documenti per passare la frontiera.

Quel 15% di clandestini che arrivano senza documenti tramite una frontiera controllata (cioé ormai solo queli che arrivano tramite il Mediterraneo) sarebbero il caso che citi. 

Il problema è che queste persone arrivano via mare, normalmente su imbarcazioni che non possono fare un viaggio di ritorno (perché prive di pilota, danneggiate e prive di autorizzazioni allo sbarco in un qualsiasi altro paese), quindi non si può semplicemente ""mandare via"" i clandestini. Per ""mandarli via"" bisogna identificarli (problematico, in assenza di documenti) e convincere il paese di origine ad autorizzarne il rientro (problematico, in assenza di trattati specifici).

Quindi, per rispondere alla tua domanda:

It's like you want to say things that sound right when you lack an understanding of basic economics and international relations. It's not like China is shipping all of those manufactured goods to the United States just because. American demand for Chinese goods keeps China producing things, which with its export-led model of development leads to economic growth, which employs hundreds of millions of Chinese workers and so on. China needs that US demand. During the financial crisis when American demand and thus imports dipped perilously low, the Chinese, who were fearful of the effects on their economy initiated a temporary stimulus to soak up the excess demand left by the decreasing amount of exports to the US. 

And even today one of China's primary concerns internationally is that if Europe doesn't make a turn around and European demand for Chinese goods shrinks it will adversely affect Chinese economic growth and development. Most of the scholarly consensus is that while both economies would be adversely affected by a cut off in trade or China attempting to coerce the US over the debt, the loss in demand for Chinese goods would absolutely devastate the country in a way that it wouldn't in the US or Europe which are much more developed markets and much more self sustained. In fact as a percentage of merchandise trade to GDP, to US is one of the most [independent economies in the world](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TG.VAL.TOTL.GD.ZS?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=asc).  China is only able to keep producing so much as long as there is the large market of the developed world to sell to and as long as they can keep buying stable US treasuries with all of those dollars the Americans send to them. 

Which brings me to the point you made about the ""single phone call"". China holds over 1 trillion (with a t) dollars in US treasuries. If they were in any way to goad the United States over their holdings the result would be a plummet in the value of said treasuries. This would certainly have bad consequences for the US ability to service its debt but don't you think it could possibly harm the country that has 1 trillion dollars in wealth invested in them? The Chinese would have no motivation to pressure the US on its debt or stop buying treasuries unless it was planning on committing economic suicide, which I'm quite certain the Xi Jinping and the rest of the Standing Committee isn't interested in.
