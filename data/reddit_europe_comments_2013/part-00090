 I suppose I find your accusation of racism baffling because they look exactly the same as everyone else. I couldn't give a shit if the person living in the camps was Roma, Irish, Black or Danish.

1. Parliament should initiate legislation and be the lower house, an absolute minimum requirement. Allow the Parliament to form a European Government.

2. Make the Commission either directly elected or a 3-seat appointment by each national government, thereby also assuming the job of the European Council.
In the case of the second option, the 3 seats are in place to better represent coalition governments, and a national parliament may appoint new commissioners if they form a new government.

3. The definitive head of the European Union should be either the head of the European Parliament a.k.a. the ""European Prime Minister"" or a directly elected President. I feel more comfortable with a prime minister personally, but I've heard some decent arguments for a president regarding voter engagement.

This isn't a disagreement of Keynsians and Classical economists. This is really basic shit he either gets wrong or considers revolutionary.

The author seems to be smugly assuming that the premise of the piece, 'In short, austerity is recessionary', is somehow a controversial statement. Yeah...no shit. Short term spending boosts the economy, the problem is that if it is not demand driven then you store up problems for the future. 

He then claims it is somehow odd that:

&gt;'the debt burden, which is simply the government debt relative to GDP, was increasing.'

In spite of deficits falling. Surely someone with a modicum of sense would sense would realise that if you were still running a deficit, then you'd still be running up debt. You'd just be doing so at a lower rate. The figures -taken from an article that he linked to - show exactly that.  

&gt;""Both the euro-zone and all of the E.U. states together saw a roughly 3% debt-burden increase. Why is that?"" 

Actually, based on the figures he supplied (from the Herald Tribune article he linked at the bottom) it is a 3.7% increase - 3.7% to 3% is a big rounding error when you are dealing with trillions of Euros and in this highly accurate economic context. Why is that? Because on average they are running just under a 4% deficit (down from 4.4%) and borrowing costs have lowered due marginally more favourable market conditions and action from the ECB. Next year the debt-burden will increase at a lower rate if they decrease their deficit but rise again. 

&gt; Even if GDP contracts without any increase in the deficits, we would expect to see the total debt-burden in the euro-zone worsen relative to the combined debt-burden of all the E.U. states, unless a number of non-euro-zone states were also undergoing austerity. 

What? If GDP contracted we would expect a corresponding rise in debt spending unless the government was also undergoing austerity at the same time. I'm struggling to get my head round what that paragraph means to say, or what point the author is trying to make. I don't understand why he'd introduces non-euro-zone states into this. Also there is not a state in Europe that isn't currently not undergoing austerity. The UK, the largest and most significant is certainly undergoing austerity, whether it is 'savage' or 'not fast enough' depends on which paper you read. That is a completely bullshit attempt to manipulate a set of statistics to make a point that is complete and utter shit. 

&gt; Austerity reduces demand in the economy and increases unemployment, which in turn puts pressure of governments to increase social spending—either by raising taxes or increasing the deficit, and thus debt.

Going bust because a nation is unable to service it's debt also reduces demand and increases unemployment. Does he think that borrowing equals free money. The cost of servicing debt in the UK amounts to about £800 per man, woman and child. Around 50% of people don't pay tax, so that is around £1600 per taxpayer, 3% of GDP, 6% of Government expenditure. 

&gt;with the most vulnerable people put most at risk. 

Ah - a true statement, but here in lies the politics of the article. Another American deficit denier. 

&gt;Yet how is it then that the debt-burden of the euro-zone did not change in percentage terms relative to all of the states put together?

That literally makes no sense and doesn't correspond to any of the figures the article puts forward. Who wrote this shit? There is one reference - to a fucking Herald Tribune article - at the bottom for all the figures (which he still manages to miscalculate. I sincerely hope this blog dies, it is utterly shameful.

With this three images it seems as if the killing of Jews would have been a necessity to get to the light from the darkness - which is not what this flag is about!

The flag is a reminder of our history and the struggle for personal freedom, freedom of thought and unity in demogracy. It origins in the resistance versus Napoleon and later the freedom and national movement of 1830 to 1848/49. 

It always hurts my heart to see this beautiful flag and the idea of freedom associated with it used by racists in the last years, who obviously don't know the basics of vexillology or history. This is the flag that always opposed nationalists, conservatives and monarchs and became a symbol for freedom and unity. But try to explain that to a skinhead in a train...

Take the example of hurricane Katrina.  Louisiana and Mississippi took a major economic hit.  Their marine sectors shut down and they had massive damage to repair.  

Since their economies turned sluggish, their tax obligations to the Federal government shrank substantially, reducing flow of money out of the states.  At the same time, all sorts of people became eligible for disaster relief, needs-based safety net programs, unemployment, etc. from the Federal government.  The states were also given Federal money directly to repair infrastructure.  It of course doesn't work for everyone and a good number of people end up moving to more prosperous parts of the country and find work and a new life.  

Imagine the situation under semi-integration.  LA/MS start missing loan payments to NY and CA, so their interest rates get jacked up, disabling their ability to borrow and increasing flow of money out of the states.  LA/MS state safety net programs and unemployment benefits are hit up by all the disaffected people, but the economy is not producing enough wealth to pay for all of it, exacerbating the need to borrow in a situation where borrowing has been made much more difficult.  

NY and CA agree to extend fresh loans to LA/MS in exchange for a future ownership stake in their maritime industries and a restructuring of the state's needs based safety net programs.  LA/MS citizens can't find jobs in the slowly recovering maritime industry, and get thrown off the welfare rolls per the emergency loan terms.

Anyway, I wouldn't take much meaning from this article. The estimated size of the shadow economies are just that, estimates. Further more, just because it's illegal activity, doesn't mean it can be taxed. If we started taxing drug dealers, they'd probably move somewhere with a lower tax rate. Furthermore, a lot of the shadow economy stuff is ilegal and thus if we cracked down on it no extra money would be earned because it would just disappear. Personally I'm all for legalisation of all substances as I believe that it is a person's right to fuck up their own lives, so long as they're given the freewill to do it and that they know the consequences of their actions (ie, harmful substances like cocaine should be clearly labelled so). However, if I was campaigning for the legalisation of substances, I wouldn't talk about profitability as I believe tat law should be defined by what is right and not by what is economically beneficial, which a lot of politics is geared around at the moment.

I could claim that the France and the UK's (c 2010) relationship has parallels between the US and Soviet Union (c 1950) relationship. Obviously these two relationships are completely different in basically all aspects, but I could talk about how both relationships have similar amounts of populations between both partners and how they both have similar levels of power (economic, political, military) but I don't really think it's worth comparing the two sets of relationships. If this makes sense. 

There's definitely a North-South divide in Europe, which I think is even bigger than the East-West divide is *today*. But I'd say the situation is more akin to the North South divide in the USA rather than in Korea. We have our differences, but we have enough in common to create and run this quite nice political-economic union and to be honest it's pretty impressive (this goes for USA and EU). There can often be huge difference in opinion between the heads of state of each country/state but it's what we agree on that's important, not what we disagree on. The news *always* focuses on where political organisations disagree, but you'll usually find they agree on the overwhelming majority of things.

Maybe.  If so, I don't blame them.  They'd be betting on AKP staying in power though and would be risking the opposition turning increasingly anti-US by doing so.  Not that US support for unpopular regimes is unheard of, but this is not a good bet for the long run.  We're not privy to this information though, so it is unclear what they are thinking.  

&gt; As I understand it the voting patterns of poor people moving to cities is not changing either i.e. stregthning the conservatives in the cities as well.

Nitpick: in no reasonable sense are these people _conservative_, much of this stuff they do down to the much-talked-about headscarf style is new.  There's a particular amalgamation of organized and politicized religiosity that's proven attractive to the relatively newly urbanized masses, yes.  

Keep in mind, though, this is happening in a relatively high economic growth environment and many of the structural reforms that underlie it were done by the previous gov't at a very heavy cost (all coalition partners were voted out of the parliament!).  The understanding that people are voting for the AKP on ideological or religious reasons is false, IMHO.  They fell below 40% in local elections when the effects of the economic crisis were being felt.  They are getting rewarded for success by their voters, and had they acted somewhat differently they may have surpassed 50% easily.  

&gt;Also, Turkey don't have the ""joker"" in form of the military to stir up politics anymore, this has created a new politial landscape where both populism and punishment (for journalists and such) can be used to a much greater extent.

We don't know if that is true.  The problem isn't/wasn't simply the military but rather what's locally referred to as the 'deep state.'  A certain number of people are in jail, some are convicted [pending appeal] but what the AKP did in that regard and all those trials did absolutely nothing to convince us that (1) they dismantled the 'deep state' (2) they jailed the right people (3) that enough has been brought to light that we can understand what went on in wrt. the 'deep' stuff.  So that 'joker' might still be there, and it might yet surface when the time comes.  That's what I think anyway.

I got it from wikipedia first, backtracked the source to [B.G. Teubner (limited preview)](http://books.google.de/books?id=DAHM46NRrQAC&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q=der%20Knechtschaft%20durch%20blutige&amp;f=false). He writes that the Lützowsche Freikorps of the Prussian king (Prussian irregulars) who were recruited from students against Napoleon got black uniforms with golden buttons. The red is said to represent the blood. 

I'll quote: ""Aus der Schwärze der Knechtschaft durch blutige Schlachten ans goldene Licht der Freiheit."" (from the blackness of serfdom through bloody battles to the golden light of freedom). 

He doesn't write it, but I know from classes that this student soldiers also were said to be the first to wear those colors as a flag, it ~~should not be too~~ is hard to get sources on that ~~I think~~. After 1832 the flags were all over the student fraternities (and after 1848 forbidden by death sentence in some states).

However, Teubner does not provide a source and you got me curious too now, so I did some short research. [Dr. Bernhard Reinhold Pilz wrote an essay on this exact topic](http://www.danubia-muenchen.de/upload_vortragstexte/vortragstexte_1344281282.pdf). I did not read the whole article, but on pages 29 (source 72) he quotes a letter from 1831 by Professor Karl Follen who was in USA exile at this time, in which he provides the same interpretation. This is not the only interpretation that I found though, after all, those are just three colors and people associate different attributes to them. Other interpretations mentioned in that article are ""designation, hope, vigor"" and ""honor, freedom, fatherland"". Even if the interpretation is not certain though, its history as a symbol of the unity and freedom movement of the early 19th century is.

&gt;Do the Nazis actually use it? I thought they rather disliked it and preferred the black-white-red one.

There are stupid neo-nazis and there are brainless neo-nazis. There are also radical leftists that will destroy flags on cars at world championships and leave a card saying this would be a ""Nazi-Symbol"" who I judge equally harshly (though I own neither a car nor a flag myself).

Sidenote: I know a student fraternity who still uses the traditional black-white-red one in my city.

Trotz unzähliger Wiederholungen ist diese Behauptung beweisbar falsch:  

die deutsche Wirtschaft, samt Exporten, stagnierte erst einmal vier Jahre lang nach der Einführung des Euros, von 2000 bis 2004. 

&gt;Löhne gedrückt und dann auf den Exportweltmeister onaniert.

Deutschland ist seit über 40 Jahren eine der führenden Exportnationen. Auch noch mit der DM, lange vor dem Euro, bei höheren Reallöhnen als heute. 

&gt;Zu Kosten der Nachbarländer.

Deutsche Exporte:

- 1999 in den Euroraum 235 Mlrd., in andere Länder 275 Mlrd., 46% zu 54%.

- 2010 in die Eurozone 393 Mlrd., außerhalb 566 Mlrd., 41% zu 59%.  

V.a. Asien und europäische Länder mit eigener Wahrung bieten größere Absatzchancen  als die Eurozone. 

Reales Wirtschaftswachstum im jährlichen Durchschnitt während dieser Zeit: 1,2%. 

Zum Vergleich: von 1990 bis 1998 waren es 2,4% - ganz ohne Euro. 

Die spanische Wirtschaft wuchs von 1999 bis 2010 real um durchschnittlich 2,6% pro Jahr, die irische um 3,9%. 

Dabei hat niemand hat Länder wie z.B. Irland oder Spanien gezwungen, übermäßig Kredite aufzunehmen, um damit Grundstücksspekulation und Bauboom zu finanzieren, oder aus  Deutschland zu importieren.  Unangemessen niedrige, weil lange Zeit einheitliche Kreditzinsen im Euroraum haben dazu geführt. 

Und was Griechenland betrifft: dort gibt es seit gut 40 Jahren eine negative Handelsbilanz. 
Dafür einen angeblichen deutschen Wirtschaftsimperialismus, mit Euro und Niedriglöhnen als Waffen, verantwortlich zu machen scheint gelinde gesagt ein wenig realitätsfern.

Wenn der Protektionismus und die Bankenverflechtung der EU nicht wären, hätten auch statt Deutschland China, Japan, Korea oder die USA diese Märkte bedienen können. Mit Krediten, Gütern, und Dienstleistungen. 

Die Gefahren der Währungsunion sind von zahlreichen bekannten Wirtschaftswissenschaftlern lange vorhergesagt worden, darunter Nobelpreisträger wie Milton Friedman und Paul Krugman.  Und von den Politikern der EU ebenso lange ignoriert. Die Bankenkrise 2008 wurde schließlich zum Auslöser der Eurokrise. 

Wer jetzt auf Europakritikern oder der AfD herum hackt und sie als 'Populisten' abzutun versucht, der übersieht, daß europaweit die etablierten Parteien kräftig beim Geld ausgeben und Schulden aufhäufen mitgemacht haben, nur um dann ihren Wählern ""Austerität"" zu verordnen, als die Situation unhaltbar wurde. 

Das Ergebnis ist Massenarbeitslosigkeit und Verarmung - und wird sich gewiss nicht mit elitärem Naserümpfen und hohler Propaganda von den angeblichen Segnungen des Euros überwinden lassen. Wenn das Establishment parteiübergreifend 'Alternativlosigkeit' predigt, dann bildet sich die Opposition eben außerhalb des gewohnten Spektrums.

La gestion de projet et la maitrise technique sont 2 domaines totalement opposés, qui ont leur majeure (spécialité) en 4ème et 5ème année à EPITA.


Tu peux très bien faire une école de commerce et te retrouver maitre d'oeuvre dans des projets à dominante technique (du style projets web) ou bien même consultant ERP sans vraiment de background en informatique (j'ai connu des consultants SAP pur fonctionnel venant de HEC ou de fac même).


EPITA se distingue car elle forme des ingénieurs (dans le sens général) mais avec une expertise technique très forte. Cela veux dire être capable de gérer des projets, mais aussi mettre la main à la patte (programmation) s'il le faut. 


Il n'y a peut-être pas de différence à la sortie de l'école qu niveau salaire ou titre, mais au niveau des perspectives de carrière, cette polyvalence représente un gros atout.


Par exemple un poste de RSSI (responsable sécurité de système d'information), ou de consultant sécurité a besoin d'une forte expertise technique (connaitre les différentes vulnérabilités, pouvoir comprendre l'assembleur, analyser les binaires, etc), chose qui n'est pas abordé (ou pas assez en profondeur) dans des écoles plus généralistes.


Il est beaucoup plus facile dans une carrière de passer de la technique vers du management, beaucoup plus difficile dans le sens inverse.

France, the UK, USA, Russia, etc all have names that were determined before there was an official transliteration system.  Perhaps the ones with transliterated names now had different names before, but they didn't last.  I'm not sure why that is.

What I do know is that most countries are transliterated in a systematic way, the same way western surnames are.  There are specific characters that are always used to represent each sound when transliterating.  ""Lan"" is one of them.  They aren't actually trying to name a bunch of countries after flowers; it's just how the ""land"" is transliterated into Chinese, using a set character with a neutral-to-positive connotation that is not used much otherwise.

Si on suit mon hypothèse c'est tout bonnement le contraire. Les États-Unis et plus généralement la domination de l'anglais et du modèle anglo-saxon sur le monde sont une source de fierté pour les britanniques (peut être à l'origine de leur arrogance).

Not the same people.

The Greek government put the country in the dire situation it's in and they're the ones who asked for help.

The average Greek was the one paying for their governments' mistake and they're also the ones that felt hard done by not only their government but also those who were ""doing business"" with them and who they believed were/are consciously screwing them over. It's difficult to appropriate the blame (be it to a country's govt or their ppl) and obviously their response was impetuous and naive. 


&gt;I mean did they actually expect to just receive loads of money without sacrificing anything at all? And I don't even consider introducing a German-inspired tax system, or getting rid of lifetime public job guarantees a sacrifice. Or to work until they're 67 for that matter.

Sorry I might've not understood correctly. Again with the ""they"", the govt ""they"" knew they would have to do something about it, the people ""they"" seemed like they'd rather leave the euro than undergo the degree of austerity measures currently in action. Also, the average Greek works longer than the average German, so it's also a HUGE fucking insult when there are such stereotypes that can be quashed by facts. And again I don't want to come off as aggressive in any way, so if such interpretation arises I will try to explain myself better.

Finding a job without speaking German and having a formal qualification is almost impossible. However, you can apply at companies for a training, but again, the TVET schools only teach in German. 

There are 2 forms of Universities in Germany, Universität and Fachhochschule. An Universität expects a German Abitur or equivalent. The German academic and school system differs in that way and is pretty unique. 
What is considered equivalent depends on where you are from and what you did in your school. However, universities in Germany are governed by the federal states, so the local laws apply.  
A Fachhochschule is usally easier to get in, but they only offer certain courses (Engineering, Economy etc.)

Have a look at http://www.uni-assist.de/university-applicants.html

&gt; Another question, what prices are cheap apartments in cities and those in towns? Where is it cheaper to live?

Depends on. I pay less for my 60m^2 apartment than students pay for a small room in Munich or Hamburg. Crowded university towns (Munich, Hamburg, Heidelberg etc.) are usually way more expensive than smaller towns in rural areas. 

&gt; What is the cost of living for say a week or a month?

You can live comfortably with 1000€ per month, depending on where you live.

Concerning your marks and being allowed into german universities... you can get into german universities if you have at least 2 subjects on A levels, 3 on intermediate and the Test in ""System of Knowledge"" - http://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/schulabschluesse-mit-hochschulzugang.html#land_gewaehlt (Homepage is in German only unfortunatly).
Universities in Germany work with a range of systems. Marks are usually given in points. The range here is between 0 and 15 points - 15 points being the highest mark achievable.

Finding a job really depends on in what area you wanna work. In most speaking German will be necessary tho.


Finding apartments again differs on the town / city you go to. Berlin used to be cheap, Munich is the most expansive one in Germany. Generelly speaking going to the newer federal states to cities like Leipzig, Dresden, Magdeburg is cheaper than going to cities in the west and south.
To get a general idea what rent costs in a certain city, just google 'city name + Mietspiegel' - every town in Germany releases a sheet which states what the average rent is - again those will probably be in German only.


Maltese driving licence is accepted in Germany, since Malta is part of the EU. There are only restrictions if you have a licence to drive Buses or Trucks :-P


Costs of living depend on what you do and need, and where you life as well.
I'd say, that you can make a really good living with 400-600 € (for rent, food etc.) a month, tho I know people who barely scrap by with 1000 €.

true,bbmm,null,null,"&gt;The headscarf issue is a fight between kemalism and the traditional ottoman values, hence a fight between western and Eastern values. 

Not so simple.  I know this is the popular narrative, but there's nothing 'Ottoman' about the headscarf thing.  Both sides may like saying this tho.  'Ottoman' for one side is an empire that collapsed and caused misery/backwardness, and it means past glory for the other.  The headscarf issue today is more about urbanization, people getting more religious in a particular way _after_ they get urbanized and getting organized around religion.  This is why how it is tied becomes an issue (the new style is rejected by the old order).  

&gt; Turkey managed to avoid the islamic backlash of the late 70s and early 80s in the rest of the middle east (probably due to the military taking over).

Turkey had a far left problem in the 70's, and Islam was used against that too.  The coup of '80 shifted the state ideology towards what's called Turk-Islam synthesis which may, alongside the other sociological factors, have helped the resurgence.  The 1984-ish mantra that goes 'the army is against Islam, the army has always been against Islam' is just that (I don't know about Europeans but I've seen a few Americans swallow this hook line and sinker and repeat it).  The AKP is actually a related but different phenomenon than the supposed rise of religiosity.  I'd be very surprised if a party could go near 30% on religiosity alone.  

&gt;  Ít is possible that Turkey is having a mini ""backlash"" of its own with the election of the AKP.

Possible, but there are other explanations that work better that involve pecularities of politics here.

I do undertand that many Greeks now feel resentment towards Germany for taking active part in changing their lives. I found it however extremely tasteless and primitive to be using nazi references when all Germany did was to help Greece not fall into a dark endless economic pit.

I understand the people would rather leave the euro, but the government didn't. This leads to the people getting angry about the changes because they had no say in the matter at all.

I didn't say that Greeks didn't work as long as Germans. I merely mentioned that adding 2 more years to the normal retirement age isn't that big of a deal, in my opininon.

I did not know that Germany actually gaines money from bailing out failing economies. This seemes a little unreal to me.

I'm sure many will recommend the tourist spots, but if you're looking for nice bars, check out Hook, La Bosc de les Fades and Stoke.

**[Bosc de les Fades](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d1008608-Reviews-El_Bosc_de_les_Fades-Barcelona_Catalonia.html)** - It's essentially a small forest or wood inside, which was pretty cool. Found at the bottom of Las Ramblas, can't miss the small alley way that leads to it. Go in for a pint. Lovely place, but not the kinda bar you'd sit in all night.

**[Hook](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d244890-Reviews-Hook-Barcelona_Catalonia.html)** - A really quirky and cool bar. It takes it name from the film, so it's all pirate themed. Every inch is covered in pirate memorabilia and objects. Very small and only one or two bar staff on, who make cocktails and have the odd bottle of beer. Superb inside and probably a place you can chill out in for an evening of drinking.

**[Stoke](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d3693856-Reviews-Stoke_Bar-Barcelona_Catalonia.html)** - Not too far from Las Ramblas, just off it. Again, quite small, but really chilled out and most noticably, the cheapest bar I visited. Serves up some superb food and great cocktails. All the staff are great and easy to get along with. I get a bit of a hostel/travellers/student bar vibe from it, but really nice. Definitely a bar you can sit in all night and get drunk.

Because everyone would rather live in a nice, quiet neighborhood in the suburbs or a developed city like Ghent or Antwerp instead of the slum that is Brussels. Brussels has nice parts but those aren't affordable for most people. The deterioration of Brussels is for most due to geopolitics: the city is a constitutional clusterfuck. Not only does Brussels has its own Community, it has [19 (!) mayors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels#Municipalities). Result is that nothing gets done as everyone blames the other guy. Any attempt for reform will block the whole country as all those 19 mayors are from Francophone parties.

To give some numbers about the etnic composition of Brussels ([source](http://www.npdata.be/Data/Vreemdelingen/Vreemde-afkomst/1990-2008/tabellen/Portaal/index.html)): In 2008 out of a total population of 1.048.491 there were:

- 333.195 ""Old Belgians""
- 715.296 (68.2%) of foreign origin, of which: 340.460 of European origin, 363.357 Non-European origin and 11.479 Refugees.

The Flemish Region has 816.245 foreigners (379.781 Non-European) on 6.161.600 total population and the Walloon Region has 778.087 foreigners (206.844 Non-European) on 3.456.775 total population. And most of those are located in the cities.

Regarding the Abmahnung there are three options available:
You either sign it and pay, don't sign it and risk a lawsuit or sign a modified Abmahnung.  
If you sign it, you might well try to haggle, saying that you did not do it, are about to leave the country, don't have much money etc.  
If you don't sign and pay, I would definetely recommend to find a lawyer. It might very well be that the Abmahner looses interest – after all, there might be easier prey.  
The third way means that you do pay, but modify the Unterlassungserklärung, maybe lower the penalty and more importantly cross out e section that reads something along the lines of ""if I download anything ever again, I agree to be enslaved by you for the rest of my life"".

First of all, the city is not a slum. Some areas are very poor indeed, but Brussels is a large city and no +1 million city in Europe (except perhaps Zurich) can say it doesn't have poor areas. And let us be clear: Brussels has no downright slums (actual shanty towns), while a major city like Paris does. The perception of Brussels is very skewed in Belgium, a lot of people who have never been there have this view that it's like South Central LA. If you look up crime statistics, Brussels actually comes out as one of the safer metropols of Europe (I'm on my phone, so no link but it's easy to look up)

Secondly, Brussels is not boring (at least to the people who actually live here). I dare say I know most Belgian cities pretty well (Antwerp, Ghent, Liege mostly), and Brussels is, by far, the most interesting. Ghent has extraordinarily beautiful ancient monuments, Antwerp has a cool cosmopolitan vibe thanks to its harbour, but both still seem ""provincial"" to me. They're too small. They don't have that ""world city"" feel that Brussels is getting more and more.
Brussels has an abundance of delicious restaurants and awesome bars. There's even a ton of decent clubs! The area of Sint-Katelijne, for example, boasts a ton of cool bars and clubs. Ixelles' student area (35.000 students) has an amazing nightlife as well. Good restaurants of any ethnicity are scattered across the city, just like musea, concert venues, parcs and other sights.

If certain groups get to big, they perpetuate these negatove patterns within their own subcultures. That's what happens with the large immigrant groups in the US and also in Europe.

Yes, perhaps the analogy is apt.  Of course in Turkey there is no element to inflict some kind of bigotry on them due to their foreignness.  Though there's this insane white/black Turk expression that popped up a decade or so ago that gets exploited even by the PM.  You are right, it is challenge, and I think we may well be over the hump.  That is, that kind of religiosity may have peaked already and that bunch will slowly secularize.  (It took what's called a postmodern coup, two party closures, much strife and strain and pointless but very real polarization.  So even if we're over the hump it wasn't cheap.

Also, why does the ISP, in this case Deutsche Telekom, simply hand out personal information of paying customers like that? Isn't that supposed to be protected by privacy laws like it is in my country (except in extreme cases - in which case a court warrant is required)? And isn't this handing out of personal info in contradiction with the wiki exerpt I posted above?

If they set you a time limit (German: ""Frist"") for your reply (and it is way to soon) (have your GF) write them a letter telling them that you do not agree to the time limit because there is no need to hurry and you need time to fetch a lawyer. 

Remember that I am just a random person on the internet, I only have an OK knowledge on the laws involved but I do not know most relvenat rulings. Also, I could be lying to you. And if you look up guides, there are many that might be bullshit, as they could be made by random people (like me) or, even worse, the exact law firm trying to get money from you.

Also, as a service announcement to every german: DO NOT USE P2P for anything remotely not legal. In P2P you automatically distribute the content, which is way more illegal than just downloading. For law firms it is easy to monitor the IPs in torrents, so it is very easy to press money from somebody. If you need illegal things, just download it from sites like Megaupload.

Random amount of money. It needs to be high, so the law firm can get more money from the case. There have been roulings about that (I remember reading about one related to music). The amount is way too high.

&gt;case a court warrant is required

yes, they got one. The reason is that, using P2P you distribute the file, making it a way worse offense (perhaps even comercial copyright infridgment).  That is why, in germany, you never use P2P for illegal things (not blaming you/her, just reminding everyone). Sadly, even it said information was obtained illegaly, it is still usable in court (as is all illegally obtained information in germany - sadly). Also, the court and the Law firms are buddies. The law firm is probably situated in Hamburg, as the court there is quite famous for their insane bullshit rulings...

I know of a case where a family was blamed, and they addmitted it unnkwoingly while trying to haggle. If they did not, they (to my knowlege) could not have been sued, because it was not clear who  actually commited the infrigement.  So never admit anything.

There would seem to be massive arbitrage opportunities across Italy-France, Italy-Austria or Italy-anywhere. But there probably aren't; knowing Italy, there'll be taxes and regulations driving prices up to ridiculous levels.

Scandinavian energy is super-cheap because of abundant hydroelectricity, because of competition between both local and Russian gas, and also because of nuclear.

Bulgarian, Romanian and French electricity are all much cheaper than they otherwise would be, because of the large presence of legacy nuclear plants churning out almost-free electricity from deprecated capital.

I'm not sure why things are pricier in the UK and Ireland. First guess: that might owe something to the tendency for banks to prefer consumers over businesses, and for investors to traditionally demand higher yields (higher cost of capital adds massively to the cost of power). Second guess: island effect and lower number of cross-border transmission lines reduces the number of competitors on the market, resulting in higher costs &amp; prices. If those two causal factors are prominent, there might not be an easy policy answer.

true,umman,null,null,"&gt; die deutsche Wirtschaft, samt Exporten, stagnierte erst einmal vier Jahre lang nach der Einführung des Euros, von 2000 bis 2004.  

Dann kam HartzIV. Sinkende Lohnstückkosten und dadurch steigende Exporte. Mein Punkt verbleibt im Rahmen des Kontext relevant und richtig. Du hast ihn nur nicht verstanden.

Auch interessant: https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:HBSaldo_ToT.png&amp;filetimestamp=20080512174326

Und: 

&gt; Deutschland ist seit über 40 Jahren eine der führenden Exportnationen. Auch noch mit der DM, lange vor dem Euro, bei höheren Reallöhnen als heute.

Aha ja und inwiefern macht es das was ich gesagt hab irgendwie falsch? Vor allem in dem Kontext? In dem Kontext sind nicht allein die Reallöhne relevant sondern die **Produktivität**. **Zusammen** ergeben sie die Lohnstückkosten deren Verlauf seit der Einführung so aussah: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=de&amp;pcode=tipslm20

Weisst du schon was Lohnstückkosten sind und warum sie so wichtig sind?

Was jetzt nicht nur historisch/geologisch benachteiligten EU-Ländern in den Arsch getreten hat, sondern auch den gleichwertigen in direkter Nachbarschaft. Frag mal die holländischen Bauern.

Die Geschichtlichen Hintergründe zu Problemen in Spanien z.B. liegen in der Franco Era (Thema Immobilien. Hast du sicher auch noch nie was von gehört. Versuchs mal mit google. Dann lernst auch was.). Dieses Land zusammen mit Irland in einen Satz zu packen der auch so so klingt:

&gt; Dabei hat niemand hat Länder wie z.B. Irland oder Spanien gezwungen, übermäßig Kredite aufzunehmen

zeugt entweder von Gleichgültikeit oder Unkenntnis der Tatsachen. 
Wahrscheinlich soll das aber einfach nur mal wieder vom neuen Wirtschaftsstammtisch gefallen. Liegt nun auf der gleichen Tonspur wie der Kümmeltürk den ja auch keiner gezwungen hat her zu kommen...

Ich weiss nicht wie du so hirnlos noch die DM hier reinwerfen kannst. Dir ist schon bewusst, dass ich hier über den europäischen Binnenmarkt spreche oder? Lohndrückende Arschlochnationen wie Deutschland schaffen **sofort** ein Ungleichgewicht. Handelsbilanz [Definzite/Überschüsse](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Einfuhr_Ausfuhr_Grafik.png&amp;filetimestamp=20080512172424) wirken sich sofort auf den Markt aus. Keine Ahnung was du dir mit deiner Argumentationskette gedacht hast. Was glaubst du den was das bedeut wenn ein Land in der EU viel von einem Produkt produziert? Verstehst du überhaupt diese simplen Grundregeln der VWL? Deine bisherige Argumentation (Vorlage?) geht nicht nur an meinen Punkten und am Thema sondern auch an der Realität vorbei. Sie scheint auch noch irgendwo in der Welt der BWL zu spielen. So Sparkassenniveau.

&gt;    1999 in den Euroraum 235 Mlrd., in andere Länder 275 Mlrd., 46% zu 54%.

 &gt;   2010 in die Eurozone 393 Mlrd., außerhalb 566 Mlrd., 41% zu 59%.

Guckstu: http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/158303/umfrage/deutsche-exporte-und-importe-2010-nach-laendergruppen/

Keine Ahnung wo du die Zahlen her hast. Was fällt dir auf wenn du diese Tabelle betrachtest: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=File:International_trade,_2010-2011_%28EUR_1_000_million%29.png&amp;filetimestamp=20121008124126

Vor allem wenn du die Daten die ich oben angegeben habe bedenkst.

Na?

Hier gibt es einen Artikel dazu: http://www.boeckler.de/pdf/p_imk_report_68_2011.pdf

Les mal. Dann lernst du vielleicht auch wirklich was. Diese AfD Wurfzettel sind ja was zum Konsumieren. Hier kannst du auch selber denken.

&gt; Wenn der Protektionismus und die Bankenverflechtung der EU nicht wären, hätten auch statt Deutschland China, Japan, Korea oder die USA diese Märkte bedienen können. Mit Krediten, Gütern, und Dienstleistungen. 

Zu deinen bullshitigen ""Analysen"" der EU-Kriesenländer habe ich oben schon was gesagt. Hat jetzt auch keinen Sinn in deiner Realität weiter zu argumentieren weil deine Schlussfolgerungen bereits auf Fehlinformationen basieren...

&gt; Die Gefahren der Währungsunion sind von zahlreichen bekannten Wirtschaftswissenschaftlern lange vorhergesagt worden, darunter Nobelpreisträger wie Milton Friedman und Paul Krugman.

Oh wie ich diese vorgefertigten Sätze liebe. Wie aus nem Wurfzettel der FDP. 

Wo sind den diese ""Marktmanipulierenden Wohlfahrtstaaten"" (Milton) die diese ""Wissenschaftler"" so hassen? Waren das vielleicht Griechenland und Spanien und Italien?? Nööö die sind im Norden. Da wo es den Ländern gut geht. Der Bullshit den diese Leute seit Jahren verbreiten will einfach nicht wahr werden. Egal wieviele ahnungslose BWL Zombies versuchen es zu glauben. Am schlimmsten sind jedoch die, die wie du denken diese Regeln würden ihnen sagen wie die VWL funktioniert. Sie denken sie müssten einfach nur die Regelungen abschaffen und der Markt würde sich schon von selbst regeln. 

PS. dieser ""Nobelpreis"" ist nicht DER Nobelpreis. Den haben sich diese Markmanipulaten selbst ausgedacht. Nicht nur das. Nobel hat sie dafür gehasst und war wie ich der Meinung, dass die Wirtschaftswissenschaften gar keine Wissenschaft sind. 

Google das mal nach. Dienstag bin ich wieder an Land dann kannst du mal zeigen ob du bis dahin was gelernt hast. Ich würde damit anfangen. Das sollte auf deinem aktuellen Brainwashniveau gerade noch hinzubekommen sein.

&gt; Wer jetzt auf Europakritikern oder der AfD herum hackt und sie als 'Populisten' abzutun versucht, der übersieht, daß europaweit die etablierten Parteien kräftig beim Geld ausgeben und Schulden aufhäufen mitgemacht haben, nur um dann ihren Wählern ""Austerität"" zu verordnen, als die Situation unhaltbar wurde.....blahblah habe die Phrasen von der AfD Werbebroschüre abgeschrieben also nicht wundern wenn dir die Augen zufallen ob der hohlen gebilde...blahblah

Hast du überhaupt auch nur einen HAUCH von Ahnung was es bedeutet wenn der Staat Geld ausgibt bzw. WARUM wir das getan haben? Kannst du in deiner kleinen BWL-Welt auch nur erahnen was es bedeutet? Die Leute denen du hier in den Arsch kriechst haben am meisten davon profitiert als der Staat Geld ausgegeben hat. Sie haben davon profitiert als Griechenland in Grund und Boden manipuliert wurde und sie sind es auch die nun davon profitieren, dass diese Länder gezwungen sind die Wervollsten Assets an Heuschrecken zu verkaufen!

true,Taenk,GERM,"For a democratic, European confederation","All three are very valid concerns. I will offer my opinion on all of them.

1. Our Greek fellow wants to have official government documents more easily recognized by local governments. There is absolutely nothing I could say against this. The idea that I would have to provide a birth certificate to register with the local authorities seems ridiculous, even a passport (I assume he means the traveler's document, not the national ID card) seems totally overblown. Arbitrary document requirements ultimately undermine right of residence in the EU.

2. This french woman laments that she sees different prices when she accesses the same website from different locations and sometimes they straight up refuse to deliver to certain countries. The former is classic price differentiation: People who are capable and willing to pay more are charged more, people who are less capable or willing are charged less. We see a more extreme form of this at itunes where an album can cost 10€ in the EU but less than a dollar in India. Personally I see no problem with this. Straight up refusing delivery to certain countries seems simply weird, seeing as the shops only loose business this way. Is there some kind of regulatory hurdle to have pan European delivery, even with varying costs according to country? Because let's face it, it costs more to send something from Spain to the UK than from Austria to Germany.

3. Speaking of Spain, our last interviewee is concerned that his social insurance does not translate in other EU countries, again undermining mobility. There is a pretty simple, somewhat controversial solution: Moving away from social insurance to private, capital based insurance in health, unemployment, pensions. Classic functions of governments like subsidysing these insurances can still be implemented, if done carefully, but this proposal completely avoids the problem of few people that pay pensions.

I will also offer an afterthought. With EU citizenship, especially with the right of free movement, national citizenships are undermined according to the weakest nationality law in the EU, seeing as I can get the easiest nationality and then move to my desired destination country and benefit from most things national benefit. So we see that we have a weird mix of national citizenships.",0,1368024622,null,0,false,0,c9ut0c3,t3_1dxkoy,t1_c9ut0c3,t3_1dxkoy,null,1431261960,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Il fatto che un dizionario riporti la forma ò non è necessariamente riprova che l'uso sia ""corretto"". Infatti accanto alla voce verbale c'è tanto di ""id."" ossia idiomatico. Ciò implica che, a meno che tu non stia componendo una poesia o scrivendo un romanzo neorealista, l'utilizzo della forma idiomatica è da considerarsi errato. Esso genera confusione e in un qualunque scritto ""formale"" - non solo la lettera all'assicurazione, anche la prosa ordinaria - è fuori luogo.

Der Arzt, der die Diagnose ins Leben geholt hat, und dann auf dem Sterbebett von seinem Irrglauben abkehrte, weil er Angst vor der Hölle oder um seine Reputation hat.

Was mich auch stört ist, wie unreflektiert die Idee einer fiktiven Krankheit bleibt. Wenn man wirklich auf den Kern der Sache zurückgeht, ist jede Krankheit fiktiv, denn eine Krankheit ist erstmal nur ein körperlicher oder mentaler Befund und ob dieser Befund eine Krankheit genannt wird, hängt von den Werten der Gesellschaft ab. Über die positive Interpretation der ADHS-Symptome wurden im Artikel schon einige Worte verloren, daher ein anderes Beispiel: 

Es ist durchaus vorstellbar, dass ein von unserer Gesellschaft als Krankheit bezeichneter Zustand wie Krebs in einer anderen Gesellschaft ein göttlicher Segen ist, da er die Menschen schneller zum Tod und damit ins Himmelreich bringt. Nicht so in unserer Gesellschaft, die das unausweichliche Ende des Lebens so lange und so hartnäckig wie möglich versucht zu verdrängen und zu verzögern.

Schlicht: Der Artikel ist mir bei weitem nicht radikal genug. Er gibt sich mit halbgaren Erklärungsansätzen zufrieden - vielleicht auch weil sein Augenmerk nicht bei der Erklärung, sondern bei der Darstellung liegt - nämlich die üblichen Verdächtigen: Überforderte Eltern, die Leistungsgesellschaft und ganz besonders Big Pharma. Aber Big Pharma ist nicht aus dem Himmel gefallen, sie ist gekommen, weil wir sie bestellt haben, weil wir ein unerwünschtes Verhalten pathologisiert haben, nachdem wir mit Scham und mit Strafe bei seiner Auslöschung nicht weiter gekommen sind.

Die Frage, die sich keiner stellt ist, wieso im Jahre 2013 die Gesellschaft immernoch Verhaltensweisen beschämt, kriminalisiert und pathologisiert, bei denen niemand zu Schaden kommt.

Thing is, I asked her today (not even an hour ago.) There's no real system, as far as she knows, behind naming countries. Which means there's a bunch of different ways it's done.

Some countries are done phonetically (hé lán, aì ěr lán, bō lán)
Some countries, (fa guo, de guo, ying guo, mei guo) are a combination of partial phonetics (Fa for france, de for deutschland, ying for england, mei for america) and a word for ""country"". 

She thought ""e guo"" would fit in with that format and that the ""e"" would be based on the russian word for Russia but that doesn't really work as Russia is basically pronounced Russia in Russian.

So even if the country is now eluosi, that still doesn't explain the ""e"", although it is more phonetic.

&gt;I found it however extremely tasteless and primitive to be using nazi references when all Germany did was to help Greece not fall into a dark endless economic pit.

Completely agree, the nazi references were obviously over the top. Unfortunately when people are put in such shocking conditions it's hard not to make such exaggerative claims. 


&gt;when all Germany did was to help Greece not fall into a dark endless economic pit.

Unfortunately all this ""bailout"" money isn't showing any signs of *real* help though, at least not for the average Greek. In their eyes, it covered the richer Greeks and politicians, and yet came along with austerity measures that really has crippled the average worker. 

These ""loans"" unfortunately aren't being allocated to things that will provide *real* help and actually get the country out of this mess. They're not actually helping the people in this time of need, but rather just flooding the country into even more debt. It seems as if they're curing the symptoms but not the actual problems (which are in abundance).


&gt;I did not know that Germany actually gaines money from bailing out failing economies.

I'm not sure the extent of the following, but there are examples such as [this one](http://www.lepointinternational.com/it/politica/europa/550-the-submarine-deals-that-helped-sink-greece-.html), that supposedly the Greek politician felt forced into accepting given all the loans. 

Also, that's just how debt and loans work. It's not necessarily a ""bailout"" because Greece has to pay back the financial aid, it's more of a loan. And with that loan there is interest and other dirty economic actions. 

Although Greeks may not seem like they are politically or financially conscious (they might seem like they don't care as much about that as their frape, maybe because they reelected the same politicians who got them in this mess), many youth there are interested and conscious of what's going on. 

They are experiencing similar outcomes ""soft power"" has with ""hard power"", which along with poverty is a loss of freedom, and that's why they felt so hard done by ""Germans"". This is the cause for the satirical depictions. I don't condone them, many Greeks don't, but they have been put in this situation (maybe indirectly through electing these politicians) and want their voices to be heard (and again this is unfortunately what leads to the over-exaggeration). This is what I was trying to touch base on earlier, it's difficult to place blame. In reality, it's not you, the German civilian who is at fault and nor who they believe is at fault, but yet unfortunately you are associated with the real target, the German govt. 


&gt; However I feel like most Germans want this money to be put to good use, preferably domestically.

(domestically meaning in the bailed out economies?)

Zu nennen sei Cannabis, MDMA (kürzlich in Kanada zur Behandlung von PTBS), Halluzinogene etc. Die guten Drogen jene, die, und hier liegt die Kernaussage, AUS UNS FUNKTIONIERENDE ARBEITSTIERE MACHEN.

Last I recalled, 1991 was not the 18th century. And yes, it would be a war, don't be naïve. Another thing, my ass. Look, I know catalan nationalists like to think of themselves as beings of pure light above all human concerns whose *seny*, *humiltat* and *valors* entitles them to getting things just by asking, unlike those evil castillians, but if you really, really want independence and you can't get it by legal means, then you will have to resort to the illegal means. And that means a war. And Spain doesn't have to do anything to start a war, that's a ball in Catalonia's yard. Sorry, if you want independence you will have to dirty your hands and become an evil imperialistic, bellicose, probably centralistic state just like everyone else has done at some point. That's how it works. (And don't start with M-MUH BALTIC STATES, because as fucked as Spain is now, it still has nothing to do with the 1991 Soviet Union) And if you decide to go that way, don't complain if you get your ass kicked and your cause ignored. That's how it works as well. 

&gt;Besides, the OTAN, the ONU and the EU will have a saying in the issue, won't they? Do you think that they would side with the aggressors? Ha! In the instant that the first tank is in the street, our independence is guaranteed. Spaniards lose, we win.

Considering that Mas has been consistently and thoroughly ignored in his laughable attempts to reach to the EU and the US, I assume all these people would side with the side that promises to keep the status quo, because what Europe needs now is certainly not more instability.  

Besides, you got it backwards. Spain doesn't need to do anything. It would be the Catalans who would have to take tanks out to the streets first, that's how independence wars work. And in that case, you'd be incredibly naïve to think that the international community wouldn't side with Spain. You also seem to forget that the old Yugoslavian constitution entitled each Republic to keep a National Guard: the Slovenian NG had spent months prior to the independence war buying and storing weapons in secret. If Mas wants to go that way... well, go ahead. It certainly should be fun, specially when he gets his ass in prison.

There was a landmark case a couple years ago where they held a man liable for files that were downloaded by someone who was illegally using his connection because it wasn't secured.  

There is a whole industry that has come up around this.  I had my niece over to visit last summer and she torrented a couple songs which got me a letter very similar to yours.  There are three or four main practices in Germany who are processing thousands of these cases and they're doing it pragmatically (which might be good for you).  

They are really looking primarily for the people who will be intimidated into paying immediately.  Even if only 10% or so do that then they're making money.

Some people will ignore the letters and the follow up letters and some of those people will get dragged to court and lose and possibly have to pay a lot more than they otherwise would have.

Some will ignore them and never hear anything else.

Some people (like myself) hire a lawyer that specializes in these cases and, for a few hundred euros, not have to worry about it anymore in all likelihood.  Because the guys who are sending out the letters are not super interested in spending their time in litigation with someone who actually knows what they are doing, once they get a letter back from your lawyer they will move on to the low hanging fruit that is still left over.

I see them in a balanced light too. I am Russian expat who lives in US but has lived in several other Euro countries as well.

You know Romanians because you are one whereas you don't know some of the other ethnicities you had no problems trashing. Sound familiar? People who don't know Romanians will trash them just as easily as you will trash them, but when you have deep personal experience with one ethnicity you rush to their defence. Also, you live in Sweden where you may or may not have received discrimination for being Romanian, which of course makes you pro-Romanian. That's fine, because I like Romanians as well. It's just that I don't like how you haven't learned a lesson about being nice to everyone, so you don't have problems emulating the Euros who discriminate against Romanians by discriminating against everyone whom you perceive to be on a 'lower' rung of cultures than the Romanians.

If China wants to subsidise a solar panel plant in China and then they want to sell cheap solar panels in the EU, so I might put said panel on my roof and have cheaper energy bills and more money in my pocket - then that's a choice I'm not capable of making.  I absolutely need a government to guide me on what to buy.

I don't know what you were reading before, but I'm all for heavily subsidising and/or providing protectionism for jobs which aren't commercially viable.  Those are exactly the jobs we need.

As for the appointed Commission and electing politicians, I apply the 'plumber principle'.  If I hire a plumber to do a job, and then when he comes around he hasn't subcontracted the job out to somebody less qualified who I didn't agree to hire, then I'm most disgruntled.  Where's his entrepreneurial spirit?  For extra points he should decide on who the subcontracted is by getting together with some other plumbers who I didn't phone for quotes.  Same goes with politicians.  If I elect a politician based on their ability and policies the last thing I want is for him to manage the job in hand.  No, I say.  Thrice No.   What I want for him to do is to get together with a large group of people who I didn't elect and to throw all the power I have temporarily bestowed on him, onto a 3rd person.

I absolutely need and crave your authoritarianism over me.   I need your protectionism.  Your decision making on whether I buy cheap Chinese or more expensive local.  I absolutely need that guidance, and for the EU to economically attack China - because it's not as if the machines China uses to make components, to mould plastics, to make things they sell to the world, it's not as if China doesn't buy these things in the UK.  They do, and things are going too well at the moment, so we relish any extra challenge the EU can provide to keep things interesting.

The first thing to know is that you can ignore the deadline given in the letter. Take your time, read up on the modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung *until you are sure you understand how to reword it for your case*, then send it. Avoid hiring a lawyer as he is unlikely to know more than what you can learn on the internet. There are at least 2 sites I know that are supported by lawyers anyway.

What happens next can vary. Some never hear back, sometimes you get a reply that they accept your UE but still want the money, sometimes they ignore your answer and keep sending the initial letter a few more times(which is illegal). In any case after your first response, if you did it right, you don't have to react any more. If you want to get a better feeling for how to react, try googling for the specific lawyer or movie title - often you will find forums where people share how they reacted and what happened after.

- Food Stamps: $200 a month. Hope you have access to a kitchen and fridge and don't mind going practically vegetarian!

- Housing: AHAHAHA. Know what the waiting list for public housing was in my county? *Four years*. And it wasn't free, it was sliding scale from $200 - $800 a month. Know what a homeless shelter is like? Overcrowded and unforgiving.

- Education: Are you seriously attacking the idea of free public education for all? This hardly merits a response. I'll note though that the ability for anyone to learn is *severely* compromised when you have no housing, little food, and the massive stress that comes with being poor.

- A/C: ...huh?

- Cell phones: My cell phone was $15 up front and is $30 a month, pretty cheap. You must seriously lack a sense of empathy (and since you've admitted you have Asperger's you really want to rethink your attitude) to not realize that a cell phone is absolutely vital to get anything to improve your situation: housing, food, a job, help from friends or family, etc. And the only cell phones provided by the state are if you are on the work/general assistance program which requires that you turn in proof that you are applying to jobs every week.

But let's not get lost in the details. You completely fail to understand that in order to get to a better place, one where you can ""work or give back to society"" you NEED to have a stable source of food, shelter, and communications.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; You can fire employees with temporary contracts for free the first three years(two years before). NEW: you can fire for free permanent employees under 30 years the first year. If your company is losing money or revenue(even having a net profit) the government the firing costs will be 20 days per year and the government will pay 8 days per year. And the government allows you to use interns as employees and you can fire them for free and you can pay them under minimum wage.

You need to have the ability to fire anybody at any time. European companies need to have the ability to for example imitate what Jack Welsch did in GE...

&gt; Former General Electric Co. CEO Jack Welch is the most passionate advocate. He believes that managers should assess their employees every year, and divide them into three categories: the top 20 percent, the middle 70 percent, and the bottom 10 percent.
&gt;
&gt; The top 20 should be showered with praise, affection and various and generous financial rewards. “Sprinkling” financial rewards over a much larger group is a mistake, Mr. Welch argues.
&gt;
&gt; The middle 70 should be given coaching, training, and thoughtful goal-setting, with an eye toward giving them an opportunity to move into the top. Keeping them motivated is the most difficult part of the manager’s task, he says. “You do not want to lose the vast majority of your middle 70 – you want to improve them,” Mr. Welch says in his 2005 book, ”Winning.”
&gt;
&gt; As for the bottom 10 percent, “there is no sugarcoating this,” Mr. Welch says. “They have to go.”

This is the ability that European companies are missing.

I don't know either, but crime rates within the 'home nation' are subject to many local laws and idiosyncrasies. In other words, they are not a 'control' sample. Each country has their own differing laws and different methods of reporting crime. If you're arguing that UK is very xenophobic in the arrests it makes, it would naturally make sense that other immigrants would be arrested too, but for some reason Romanians got arrested quite a lot in comparison to other immigrants.

&gt; Prior to the Spanish Labor Reforms, the Labor Act required, under certain circumstances such as unjustified dismissals, that employers make severance payments to the terminated employee computed on the basis of 45 days’ gross salary per year of employment with a maximum of 42 months’ salary. The reform law reduces the required severance payments to 33 days per year of employment and caps payments at a maximum of 24 months.  Additionally, if an employer can demonstrate three consecutive quarters of losses, the employer will now only be required to pay 20 days of severance per year of employment.

First of all, there's the separatist behavior. It's perpetuated by the politicians in Hungary, and by the UDMR ( democratic union hungarians in Romania), by the neo-nazis movements in Hungary and in Romania. 
The fact of the matter is that today, Romania simply doesn't have the same ulta-nationalistic and/or neo-nazi movements in terms of power and influence. 


But yet we keep discriminating them. Of course, without proof. They have schools in their shitty language, they have college classes in their shitty language, they have theaters in their languages, street signs in their shitty language. And yet it's not enough. We have to make hungarian and official language and make Szekely county - which is somewhere in the middle of the country - independent. 

Yet we are the haters, the xenophobes, the racist. They are the separatists which want independence based on ethnic reasons, they're the ones with the neo-nazis, and their reasons are always the same ones like - they are here for generations/hundreds of years - and so on. 

But every time I ask some dumb hungarian separatist on reddit why we don't give the serbians, russians, tatars, turks, ukrainians, gypsies and so on, the same privileges it's always the same reason - because there are more hungarians than any other ethnicity-.

Here's how it works:

You take out a mortgage. At the same time a companion savings account is opened at the same bank. Each month you are required to deposit into that account an amount equal to what an ordinary mortgage payment would be. At the end of the mortgage period, the bank is paid off using the account.

I don't know enough about the ins and outs of the tax situation to know exactly when/why this arrangement is preferable for some people, but it really is the same as a mortgage for most purposes, except that the money you're repaying technically remains in your name rather than the bank's until the end.

There is a book called High-Tech Europe which explains why European computer manufacturers failed so badly (like Olivetti, Vobis, Siemens, Philips, etc.).


Quote: 

*Philips and Siemens did not move into production of digital ICs until 1967, and then both relied on licenses from Westinghouse. In general, European companies were late entering the digital IC market and therefore did not benefit either from cumulative learning-by-doing, as the Americans pioneers did, or from economies of scale, which rewarded the first producers. By the early 1970s the major European semiconductor makers hat retreated from the standard digital IC markets, concentrating instead on small niches not subject to American competition.*

So basically Europe was late to the party, like Nokia is late to the smartphone party and is struggling now, that's the story. Nonetheless there are big European software and hardware makers, but there aren't so many as American ones.

Examples:

**Nokia**, struggling today, but they dominated the cellphone market for a decade.

**SAP**, fourth largest software maker in the world.

**Siemens**, a technological behemoth.

**Ericsson**, telecommunication giant.

**Skype**, was founded by a danish and swede in Luxembourg, sold to Microsoft for 8 billion.

**Rovio**, anybody knows Angry Birds (they aren't really big, but ...).

**Spotify**, developed in Sweden, one of the biggest streaming services for music.

Nobody said that.

&gt;I don't know either, but crime rates within the 'home nation' are subject to many local laws and idiosyncrasies. In other words, they are not a 'control' sample. Each country has their own differing laws and different methods of reporting crime.

The way the EU is structured, the labour market can't work the way it works in the US. Each country is on its own, they're trying to force the large corporations to stay in their country; they lose too much if the companies leave. The government will have to pick up the tab and pay unemployment benefits, etc for those people laid off.

In the US, this is not an issue: if a company leaves California for Nevada, it doesn't affect that much the state of California because the unemployment benefits, social security, food stamps, etc. are paid from the federal budget to which the company and the new employees will contribute in the new state.

true,boulet,YAFrance,France,"Melun in itself is pretty dull but as NorthMoriaBestMoria said: Paris is at hand. It would be smart to get a monthly/weekly transport pass. It might look a bit pricey at first but you will save money real fast. 

Also if you can, try and avoid RER D and catch ""train direct"" (Melun is sometimes the last stop before Paris Gare de Lyon). One, it will cut the train ride to a half hour. Two, depending time of day it might save you annoying encounters. Once in Paris, go crazy, the pass will let you go anywhere. Even Versailles if you want (but that means more train/RER).

Now about Seine et Marne (the area Melun is in): some parts are really pretty. People mentioned Fontainebleau and its castle. Moret sur Loing is not far and a lovely village. Both can be reached by train. 

If you like riding bicycles Seine et Marne is awesome as long as you have a map and avoid highways (totally feasible). Landscapes come in two main flavors: forêt de Fontainebleau, a national park that's very popular for horse riding and bouldering. Oh btw I'm not sure how it works in Utah but you can enter the park anywhere you want. It's free public space. The other flavor is Brie: fields, hills and farmland in general. Cute villages left and right. I wandered all around as a teenager and I loved it! 

Restaurant wise I have no advice since I've been away for a while now. But the name Brie should have struck a chord... like Brie cheese? There are different sorts. Brie de Melun is strong and pungent. Brie de Meaux is the one most people know of. Brie de Nangis is creamy, delicious and my favorite. Anyway pick the brain of locals they'll know what's about.
