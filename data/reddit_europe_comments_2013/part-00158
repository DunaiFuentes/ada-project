When traveling from Napoli to Sorrento, consider that you'll be arriving from Florence at the central train station. The local train departs from the same station, whereas the hydrofoil to Sorrento departs from the port of Napoli, which is quite far away , so you'll need a taxi or a bus ride. For the sake of convenience, I honestly suggest the former: Piazza Garibaldi (the square where the train station is) has a major renovation going on; therefore, depending on the time of the day, it may be quite difficult to find your way. Also, piazza Garibaldi may be quite a shady area, where some tourist scams and petty crime may happen. On the other hand, traveling by sea you will cross the whole gulf of Napoli, which may be a bit more expensive, yet very interesting from the sightseeing point of view, and definitely a more comfrotable trip.

Since you'd like to visit Pompei, the Amalfi coast, and Capri, I believe Sorrento is your best option as a place to stay: it's right in the middle of all those things. However, Sorrento is at the tip of a peninsula: you can very easily go to Capri by sea, to Pompei by train. Getting to Amalfi may be a bit more complicated from there. My opinion is that you will have to pick just one of those per day.

Overall the main difference was that the foreign students had parents that took an interest in their kids education.

Kids with language difficulties got extra classes. Maybe not in the same school but within a few km. This would provide introductory subjects in German with a concentration on the German way of doing things. So the end result is that we ended up with a bunch of foreigners who can do something (if not attend University).

The not so academic kids end up out of the way during secondary education so they are less of an issue. As for those who do want to study, should we be sending [these guys](http://www.crytek.com/) back to Turkey?

You don't know what you are talking about. Despite your statement a few posts back, the Crown is literally defined as a ""corporation sole"". It owns its estates, the government does not. Revenue from the estates goes to the Crown. The Crown then *gives* the government that revenue. Crown lands aren't even restricted to the UK. If you wanted Crown lands to become government lands, the government would have to use compulsory purchase - or eminent domain, as it is called in the states.

2. Eliminating perks, except for things that are purely to do with carrying out their duties (i.e., a small budget to pay for staff, office expenses. Fully audited, transparent, and publicly disclosed, of course.)

If you go to Štúrovo (Párkány), bordertown on Slovak side, you can almost everywhere see bilingual billboards, marks, signs, everything. When you cross Dunaj (Duna) and go to Ostrihom (Esztergom) which is bordertown as well, you find almost nothing written bilingual. Tip of the iceberg was little more than 10 years ago when the bridge across Dunaj was in construction, and on Hungarian side was information table written in Hungarian, English, Italian, French, etc... but not Slovak, wat ? This should be more balanced I think, but I guess it's deriving from the fact that on Slovak side live more people who speak better Hungarian than Slovak, it doesn't work same way vice versa though.

I've been in Germany for 2 years now (Mexican-American), and the problems from the Turkish community are not very different from the Latinos in USA. The issues ZeMilkman describes were noticeable even for me in a short amount of time. It is incredible for me to notice, that I speak a better German (which I've only studied for less than a year) than the Turks being born here. 

As soon as some integration is demanded, suddenly all the minorities take out their race cards and again, the Germans with their ghosts feel bad about it and say, no ok, forget about it. This guilt trip is also detrimental to a fully integration of all immigrants to Germany. If you can't cut the mustard (learn german, get a job soon, if you dont have skills, get Schulung) then you can't work, period... We're not talking about mass deportations here, but definitely something can be done.

I lived that through my German integration course. All these enclaves (Turks, Serbo-croats, Indians) have very good people, of course, it's an undeniable fact, but the others come here to exploit the system. They go to the course, they stop going, they fail the exam. They go again to the Auslanderbehörde to get another chance, same cycle repeated for years. Most of these immigrants come for work or Hartz-IV. It would be a great motivation for them to demand for stronger requirements in order to receive either of them. But God forbid the Germans asking things from the Immigrants, because, gasp Germany!

I am far from being hte poster boy for Integration, but within 2 years I learned German and got a job. Some of my friends or colleagues from the course whine instead, that Germans are so mean, and they hate immigrants, and if you're called Meryem, or Pablo, or Yevgeni you're not gonna get a job. BS. It can be done, and I can understand the frustration from people when they see Germans that were born here, and suddenly cry racism when they are being demanded something. These turks are German citizens, they ahve the same standards, obligations to become good citizens as any other German, but they get the benefit of saying ""My family is Turkish, you just don't get it"". That is far from racism.

Pretty simple. The people I mentioned stand out to me because they are the exception and make up maybe 15-20% of the Turks I know. The point is that just having a Turkish name or looking like a Turk does not prevent you from getting a job. It's lack of qualifications, unwillingness to conform with what's expected and often the lack of language skills.


&gt;Maybe you don't have a point.

I do.
&gt;Maybe you're venting your frustrations as indisputable facts.

&gt;Maybe my comment did not warrant a passive/aggressive response.

The correct wording is passive-aggressive unless you can't decide whether my response was passive or aggressive. 

&gt;These are speculations. This is not: you're a racist.

First of all Turks are not a race. Therefore even if I hated them I would not be racist in doing so. The word you are looking for is xenophobic. Secondly I don't have a problem with Turks because they are Turks. I have a problem a lot of Turks in Germany for the reasons stated. Thirdly

&gt;And maybe drinking liters of beer is just not their thing.

As a response to me pointing out that a lot of Turks are not willing to assimilate is not only passive aggressive but you also just reduced German culture to drinking beer. Which is pathetic and, unless you are a self-loathing German, pretty xenophobic.

I mean for example in both cities the 8th distict is ""Joseph town"" and it is likely not a random coincidence. Inner ring road, outer ring road... perhaps the most surprising part is the football hymns, ""imma wiada"" and ""újra itt van"" having a similar tune and similar lyrics. 

People have very similar taste in food in Austria and Hungary. Every Hungarian who tries Käseleberkäse goes ""why don't have this, this totally tastes like everything we have"". 

I think the typical goulash - type Hungarian food may be an Ottoman influence because pre-15th century cookbooks are different. As Austria today  gets a huge kebab - falafel influence the tastes are growing even similar. 100 years ago it was a common hobby to challenge Austrian/German guests with spicy hot food, today they are not so afraid of it, due to the kebab shops.

Jokes, slang is very compatible, ""don't shake that slap tree"" and all that.

Pretty much every German word ending with -el or -en can be translated as -ni -li. Socken - zokni, Trottel - trotli, Kästchen - kasztni etc. Pfuscher -&gt; fusi: does bad job or works for cash under the table (i.e. Eastern Europe normal :) )

The good thing about this is that when a Hungarian wants to earn three times as much money i.e. move abroad, then Vienna is the only place that does not feel fully foreign. It's reaussuringly similar with the Kotányi spices in the shop and the zöldveltelini (Grüner Veltliner) wine.

Hell, Mali is right next to Niger, which provides the majority of French uranium....and IIRC, French nuclear power plants power most the country.

As far as I know, ""my pet's one-time medical bill is too expensive"" usually isn't accepted as a good reason. 

Also, and I know this isn't entirely conclusive, but it does give you an idea of the general atmosphere. Just google 'Einschläferung gesunder Tiere', 'werden Tiere im Tierheim eingeschläftert?', 'kill-shelters in Germany', etc and you find a couple of forum posts by people who just found out about the practices in US shelters, stats of animal adoptions from Spanish shelters and news articles from 2007 about one shelter in Hamburg that *might* have put down a perfectly fine dog while claiming it was aggressive.

&gt;**Laqueur:** Freedom, human rights, social justice are all wonderful, and I don't want to minimize the achievements of European societies. But a role model? Europe is much too weak to play a civilizing or moral role in world politics. Nice speeches and well-intentioned admonitions carry little weight when made from a position of weakness. In fact, all they do is aggravate China and Russia. Such reproofs are presumptuous, insincere and, unfortunately, often ridiculous. Under the current circumstances, Europe would be well advised to keep a lower profile.

The world is changing. We are going from one dominated by a American Hegemony to a Multi-Polar one, with many calling the next one hundred years the ""Asian Century"".

The problem with explaining the pronunciation of Hungarian (or any other language for that matter) to a person who speaks English is that English is spoken with so many different accents.

I have a good Hungarian friend who sounds very, very Irish when she speaks English.

My kids go to an International school and a lot of their Hungarian class mates sound very, very American.

Anyway - the point is, it's tough to give written examples. It's much better to hear the words. If someone wants to hear the name of Hungary sung in Hungarian - it's in the chorus of this rather awesome Quimby song. [Kivándorló Blues](http://youtu.be/4CAeApwu1tM)

But let's talk about the threats to Europe:

- We border Northern Africa, and yes, they are an unruly lot, but they lack any military power, so they're not a military threat to us (if needed, my own country Air Force could destroy every single aircraft and ship from Morocco and Algeria, the only real military power in Northern Africa would be Egypt, because you give them a shit ton of weapons, and they are too worried about Israel to care about Europe).

But you know what's the funny thing about those two threats? They all prefer to commerce with us instead of fighting us, so maybe the soft power does in fact, work.

When they got into government, their first act was a flat tax rate. They are scrambling to fill the hole it left on the budget ever since.

Reduced funding of education, healthcare, etc... (while fucking *Soccer* gets more and more money and new stadiums - we haven't qualified for a world event since 1986, just to put it in perspective).

Every single government contract goes to companies that are owned by the same small group of people. OK, this wasn't different during the other governments either...

The difference is that they are now redistributing private businesses too. Sounds weird? Selling tobacco was fairly simple before. Then you had to apply for concession from the local government. And, lo and behold, the *vast* majority of the businesses that got the concession belong to someone close to Fidesz. (Obviously, the applications are not public.) Some where funded by the wife / nephew / uncle / brother-in-law / etc... of the major just for this purpose.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; We border Northern Africa, and yes, they are an unruly lot, but they lack any military power, so they're not a military threat to us (if needed, my own country Air Force could destroy every single aircraft and ship from Morocco and Algeria, the only real military power in Northern Africa would be Egypt, because you give them a shit ton of weapons, and they are too worried about Israel to care about Europe).

Which is why Mali and Libya were a walk in the park? Hell, NATO Major-General Marcel Druart, addressing the European Parliament committee on security and defence, said NATO relied heavily on US military expertise on intelligence, surveillance, logistical and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. In short, [NATO couldn't do Libya without the United States](http://euobserver.com/defence/115650). Remember how it was supposed to be a mainly European operation, with France, Britain and Italy being the main hitters? [That didn't last for long.](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-future-nato). My country even tried to stay out of it at first and only offer minimal support, but it wasn't long before we were maintaining the largest logistical networks, doing most the intelligence gathering and even had to start offering a good-portion of the combat missions ourselves, before eventually we also ended up taking over most of the Command-and-Control. 

And Mali? Where, even though it was supposed to be a independent French operation, France still critized the shit out of us for [""not doing enough""](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/01/29/the-united-states-must-support-france-in-mali), even though the rest of their European allies were basically doing jack shit? Until [we eventually gave in](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/03/19/us-steps-up-support-for-french-in-mali.html)? Not to mention the SOF troops we put on the ground in Niger so they could help stop the insurgents from cross-border attacks on French troops in Mali.

Yeah dude, totally fucking roll over every country in North Africa. You're completely right bro. /s

&gt;Then we have ""the evil east"", those nefarious countries such as Russia, Ukraine or Belarus, and while those countries all have huge armies, all of them lack any kind of power projection, so even if they decided to attack us they could only nuke us (and for that, nothing you can do would protect us, specially not your ""anti missile shield"").

You don't need power projection when you're target is your neighbor. Supply lines don't need to be *that long* when all you have to do is cross the border. And here's a little interesting textbook from Russian military universities, [The Foundations of Geo-Politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics). Take a look, it's a good read. 

You need deterrence. Soft power doesn't deter a country like Russia. And fuck, if you think we haven't done shit for the past half-a-century, then I want whatever the fuck your smoking. Europe has been the focal point of American strategy through-out the Cold War, it's the reason why European militaries are so small, because we carried the majority of the weight with France and the United Kingdom. Do you think the last half of the last century would've played out the same if we didn't garrison the [Fulda Gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulda_Gap)? 

But the world is changing. We recognize the Cold War is over. Europe doesn't. We won't be as committed, defensively or politically, to Europe as we were in the past. We're moving away, [""Pivoting to Asia""](http://www.foreignpolicyi.org/content/obama-administrations-pivot-asia) as the President has called it,  where 60% of our airforce and navy will henceforth be stationed. Not Europe anymore. That means we're not going to be there to pick up the slack, to help with operations like Mali and Libya. 

In the words of one of your own Generals, [the E.U. is becoming 'marginal' in Asia-centric world](http://euobserver.com/defence/118070). Which is bad, because America needs a stronger Europe so it doesn't need to help with shit like Mali or Libya or deterring Russia for you. But it can't, because you can't, which fucks us with our own overall strategy in Asia. By helping you we're hindering ourselves. America wants to see Europe take care of itself and patrol it's own neighborhood so we don't have too. The significance of this is multiplied when you realize that [China is even eyeing taking up a former U.S. base in Portugal](http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/gordon-g-chang/china-eyes-forward-base-atlantic). 

As I said before, the United States doesn't fear the competition of Europe; it only fears being the only ""West"" in the world.

&gt;Also, you point at Srebrenica, and you are totally right, we Europeans dropped the ball and let Milosevic kill tens of thousands of people in ""our backyard"", it's a shameful point in the history of Europe, and we should work together so it never happens again, but well, at least we didn't sell him the weapons like you did in your backyard with Pinochet, with the Argentinian Junta or with the Contra, so I'm not sure how you can claim any moral superiority.

I'm not claiming moral superiority. I'm claiming military superiority. Which is the problem, we shouldn't have it, we should share it with Europe, especially when it comes to European problems. Your countries should be in the lead and conducting the majority of the operations, not America.

Wednesday and Friday nights, the crowd is much less than during the daytime.  Avoid the Louvre and Orsay on Monday and Tuesday: one is closed each day, making the open museum busier than average.

Depends on you.  It's quite unique and awesome, but the line is horrendous.  Go during the week, be there at or before opening, and eat breakfast in line.  Note that the entrance can be hard to find: it is ON the plaza across from the main metro exit at Denfert-Rochereau.  Looks like a dark green outhouse and is quite small.

Combined with your other question about being poor: go to the grocery store and check out the wine selection.  Look for ones with little cardboard deals around the necks.  Check that it is for a prize or guide or selection (not just marketing).  Buy those, get surprisingly good value.

Keep your ticket in case of controls.  Buy a carnet of 10 or an all-day pass.  If you change between metro and RER (or back) you will pass the same ticket again.

Se vuoi gli stabilimenti, le docce, il bar e la discoteca in spiaggia puoi tranquillamente andare -non so la butto a caso - a Rimini o in Toscana.

Se vuoi una spiaggia libera, col mare pulito e alcuni chioschetti in cui rilassarti e farti una birra puoi tranquillamente venire in Sardegna.

Il turismo c'e' sempre stato e la gente che voleva riposarsi pure. Quindi non credo che improvvisamente tutti i turisti vogliano le discoteche.

Quello che negli anni e' cambiato e' la disponibilita' di denaro e il costo per raggiungere certi posti.

La percezione che il senatore sapesse quello di cui stava parlando e' stata un po' sminuita dal fatto che ha citato piu' e piu' volte la ""Comunita' Europea"", ""le sanzioni della Comunita' Europea"", ""le norme della Comunita' Europea"".

Peccato che la Comunita' Europea sia stata abolita il primo dicembre 2009, e al suo posto ci sia ora l'Unione Europea. E' un inutile dettaglio nozionistico ? Puo' darsi, ma ignorarlo stona assai nella bocca di chi vorrebbe fare le pulci puntigliosamente al resto del mondo.

Sul merito della questione non entro, causa la mia ignoranza in materia.

Sul carattere generale dell'intervento: le leggi e' abbastanza normale che vengano fatte dalla maggioranza politica che sta in parlamento. All'M5S e' stato offerto di far parte della maggioranza politica, e loro hanno rifiutato (come beninteso era loro diritto). Come ho scritto altrove, in questo modo si sono, per il momento, auto condannati all'irrilevanza. Evidentemente se ne stanno rendendo conto.


Comunque lamentarsi che un emendamento presentato dall'opposizione non viene accolto, quando all'opposizione ci sono loro, mi sembra un po' ipocrita.

Se al governo ci fosse il PDL, il PD presentasse un emendamento e questo venisse approvato, Grillo e i grillini urlerebbero ""Inciucio ! Inciucio ! Inciucio !"".

Ma se al governo ci stanno PDL e PD, e' l'M5S ha presentare un emendamento, e questo viene rifiutato, allora e' ""Nonnismo da caserma"".

For an Air Strike in Morocco and in Algeria, Spain wouldn't need any logistical capability (not even air refueling), we wouldn't need your inteligence capabilities (having your satellite capabilities would be nice, but we have huge HUMINT and SIGNIT deployed there)

Libya and Mali are literally RIGHT NEXT TO Algeria and Morrocco. Yet despite that, and despite the ability to use both Spanish, Italian and the numerous island airfields in the Mediterranean  *(plus, you know, the aircraft carriers)*, Britain and France *(along with their numerous European allies, I think even Spain was involved)* still needed extensive U.S. support *(admittedly, it wasn't as extensive for Mali)* for the operations to succeed. Now I remind you, France and Britain are literally the strongest military powers in the European Union with the largest capability for power projection. 

&gt;Also, I'm not sure how the fact that France wanted to save some money by passing you the bill means that they couldn't do it by themselves, hell, when the Falklands were invaded the UK was able to to fend off the Argentinians by themselves in a different continent, because obviously a country will use every single resource when need arises (the UK felt the integrity of its territory and the life of its citizens threatened), but won't break the piggy for defending some stupid country in bum-fuck Africa.

It wasn't about saving money, it was that they were unprepared. With both [intelligence](http://spectator.org/archives/2013/07/22/brother-can-you-spare-a-drone), and most importantly, [logistics](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/27/us-military-tankers-french-mali). And it wasn't so much ""passing the buck"" as, ""We literally lack the strategic airlift capability to get to Mali and need your planes."" Not to mention the SOF personnel we deployed to Niger to assist with the Mali conflict.

And the Falklands was a long time ago, the United Kingdom has retired most their aircraft carriers, retired the Harrier and have been [making drastic military cuts](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/concoughlin/100219594/britain-is-losing-the-military-capability-to-fight-alongside-the-americans/), with [France doing the same](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9955667/French-defence-cuts-could-harm-British-military-partnership.html). 

&gt;Also, regarding other of your points, what ""active defence"" does the US have in Europe right now? While it's true that during the Cold War there were thousands of hundreds of US personnel in Europe, right now most of your operations in our continent are simple pit stops for transport aircraft (I think Aviano, Rammstein).

At the moment, this is true. But remember those same ""pit stops"" are still garrisoned by a lot of soldiers, and they have been used in both Libya and Mali to assist with those operations, not to mention the Balkans as well. And the only other active defense I can mention is NATO in general, with those bases allowing the U.S. to respond quickly to any attack on Europe. It's a effective deterrence. But that's changing. We are moving to the Pacific region and reducing our footprint in Europe, yet Europe hasn't moved to pick up the slack, instead they've only continued to make more defensive cuts and rely on us even more.

Sul decreto del fare non so esattamente come sia andata. Questo invece e' quanto successo a giugno (dalla pagina facebook di una deputata del PD):

&gt; il dl 43 ambiente è un decreto legge del governo Monti che deve essere approvato entro martedì 25 giugno.Il senato lo ha tenuto fino all'ultimo modificandolo e consegnandolo alla camera giusto il tempo necessario per ratificarlo.
&gt;
&gt; Per capirci, ce lo hanno mandato all'ultimo minuto non consentendoci di fare emendamenti in tempi utili, rischio la mancata approvazione totale del decreto.Questa cosa è stata denunciata in ogni sede, in aula e nelle commissioni, ma visto che al suo interno ci sono cose urgenti come la proroga dello stato di emergenza e la ricostruzione in abruzzo abbiamo stretto i denti e siamo andati avanti.
&gt; 
&gt; Il M5S ha fatto quello che può fare l'opposizione: ostruzionismo.Che vuol dire chiedere la parola per interventi da un minuto a testa e parlare di qualunque cosa per non far votare gli emendamenti, quindi non far approvare il testo, quindi non mandarlo al senato, quindi farlo saltare.
Benissimo.
&gt;
&gt; Ieri siamo stati in aula 10 ore ad ascoltare centinaia di interventi di Lega e grillini che si alternavano, coordinati dai leghisti. Abbiamo bocciato 3 emendamenti su 120 presentati e abbiamo perso tempo.
&gt; 
&gt; Questo però a portato un grande risultato all'opposizione, non sono ironica sono seria, cioè che il governo ha ceduto e gli ha chiesto quali piccoli emendamenti si potessero fare per poi approvarlo.
&gt;
&gt; Si era arrivati ad un accordo all'unanimità, sarebbero stati assorbiti alcuni emendamenti, si sarebbe votato e poi si sarebbe spedito il testo al senato per l'approvazione finale.Ma qualcosa è andato storto , si sono chieste ulteriori modifiche, il governo ha accettato anche l'abolizione di un articolo nuovo, e ha chiesto di rimettersi all'aula.
&gt;
&gt; Ma ancora niente vogliamo di più!
&gt;
&gt; E nel frattempo erano le 15:00 si minacciava di fare ostruzionismo e si chiedevano emendamenti che avrebbero costretto il senato a ripartire con la discussione e rischiare di non approvarlo.
&gt; 
&gt; Solo allora si è chiesta la fiducia, che ha bisogno di 24 ore di preavviso, per permettere al senato di approvarlo entro martedì.
&gt; 
&gt; Ora io sono assolutamente favorevole all'ostruzionismo, ma se è finalizzato ad un miglioramento della norma, questo oltranzismo ha portato per l'ennesima volta ad una situazione gattopardiana, in cui si urla di cambiare tutto e non cambia niente.
&gt;
&gt; Risultato?
&gt;
&gt; Gli emendamenti chiesti e accolti dal M5S sono saltati, si torna al testo originale e il ruolo del parlamento perde di nuovo senso con un voto di fiducia imposto.

First of all ""the people here"" aren't the EU. There is no official reaction yet from the EU and Berlusconi (unlike Tymoschenko) probably won't ask the EU for help.

Now for the question, why the european public might have different opinions in the two cases: I think the real reason is that Berlusconi was already under investigation for several crimes while he was in power. He made laws to protect himself, etc. Now that he lost some of it, he will get house arrest, which isn't a big punishment.

Tymoshenko to my knowledge wasn't investigated when she was in power. The things she is accused of seems to either be new stuff when she left office or old things that were already dismissed by courts before she even took office. Also she is very sick and was denied proper medical treatment. She doesn't have the luxury of house arrest. Even if what she is accused of is true, the treatment she gets seems to be especially tough and it seems to be specificly because she became an opposition figure.

Now the two cases might be more similar than some think (maybe they are both guilty), but at least the treatment Berlusconi gets is much different from the treatment Tymoshenko gets. Do you think she was at any point or is now able to make such a public statement about what she percieves as injustice, like Berlusconi just did?",0,1375444297,null,0,false,0,cbfg3fv,t3_1jiatx,t1_cbfg3fv,t1_cbfe9jl,null,1429971451,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

o and e do the same thing. o becomes like my oi and e becomes like é when in front of j or ly.

They do it consistently - but the bottom line is that one has to know these sounds will change when those letters will combine. There is not a letter for each sound. And letters can change sound.

Ok the express is a shite tabloid. 

&gt;Foreign nationals being arrested for some crimes including robbery, burglary and theft have more than doubled in the period, figures show. In general, crimes committed by those born abroad has increased by 53 per cent. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9475500/Eastern-European-criminals-blamed-for-surge-in-migrant-offences.html

Ok but the telegraph is a tory paper. 


&gt;Crime has always been an import-export affair and in many ways mirrors ""legitimate"" business. As old family firms in Britain have been replaced by multinationals so, too, have the family-based gangs in Britain (the Krays, Richardsons, Arifs, Adams) been overtaken by multinationals, where different nationalities co-operate in the pursuit of higher profits. This is a two-way street. Many British criminals have moved abroad, most famously establishing themselves on the Costa del Crime.

http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/25/eastern-european-immigration-crime-britain

OK so the Guardian - as left wing and immigrant welcoming paper you can get even admits that regardless of the fact British criminals now operate in Spain eastern europeans now operate in Britain and dismisses it as ""an import/export affair"".

I know a Finnish person who I talked to about the languages some time ago, and we noticed that the words were barely similar but the way how roots and suffices were used were pretty much similar. 

The main reason to this lack of information on the roots of Turkish is that the ancient Turks were kind of like the Dothraki from GoT; they lived on horses, had a completely different culture, never settled and always moved, and never needed concepts like agriculture and text for a long, long time. For this reason, linguists decided to place the language in some family and never mention it again because nobody knew a fucking thing. People try to relate it to Uralic languages, Mongolian, Japanese, Korean, Basque, Native American languages (seriously) and many other things.

&gt; Tymoshenko to my knowledge wasn't investigated when she was in power. 

Investigatin into the how these contracts were signed started when she was still in power and carried on when she lost elections. Even Russia's [ITAR-TASS confirms this.](http://www.itar-tass.com/c154/246008.html)

&gt; The things she is accused of seems to either be new stuff when she left office or old things that were already dismissed by courts before she even took office.

Well, there also investigations into her activities as an Oligarch prior to 2000. Some of them are carried on in Ukraine and some were dismissed. Some are still investigated here and [some in the United States.](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/us-federal-court-accepts-41-million-complaint-against-tymoshenko-325504.html)

She was sentenced for a number of cases. But the one that drew the most criticism is the gas deal and how it was signed. And this case is neither old nor obsolete. And abuse of powers is a crime punishable in every european country.

&gt; Also she is very sick and was denied proper medical treatment. 

She is neither sick nor she was denied medical treatment. If her health is something [we can only speculate about](http://youtu.be/JioUKzuX_2E) the fact that she has unprecedented amount and quality of health care is something that can not be disputed. Regular treatment by the best doctors from Germany is something that no ukrainian prisoner can afford.

&gt; She doesn't have the luxury of house arrest. Even if what she is accused of is true, the treatment she gets seems to be especially tough and it seems to be specificly because she became an opposition figure.

She has a separate cell, she is allowed to accept visitors non-stop (despite her ""poor health condition"") her cell is an order of magnitude better than an ordinary cell. She is not forsed to work and there are many other things that she has or allowed to do that no other prisoner can.

The crime that she committed does not suggest a house arrest.

&gt; able to make such a public statement about what she percieves as injustice, like Berlusconi just did?

If you're going to assume they're tampering with the statistics, they'll tamper with those too. It's even easier to do that, because the GDP as we know it is one giant broken window fallacy. It would be easy to boost GDP temporarily with loans, for example. And then there might be a huge company that mostly imports and exports: great GDP boost, but very little adds to the living standard of the population.

When I think about counterfactual history I try to imagine *how* things could have been different, not just assume that they would be. Like for example if Sweden-Norway took part in World War 1, a war I think was even more certain to happen than WW2. Perhaps the added Norwegian part made Sweden enough of a power-factor that it got involved in the war, on German side. 

It's unlikely that it would completely turn the tide of war, but it could stop it from ending in the near complete defeat of Germany. Perhaps it would end up roughly with the status quo, with the excetion of Russia, which would probably still have a revolution since it would probably still be defeated. Unless they were defeated so fast that they were out of the war early, removing perhaps the biggest reason for revolution to happen in the first place.

My guess is as the 'j' and 'ly' is very very close to 'i' in pronunciation, together with the preceding vowel they are kind of making a diphtong while you say them: so the vowel tries to roll into an i every time when it's in front of a 'j' or 'ly'. It's not shifting, just easing :) But if you actually say it without shifting toward an i nobody will look crosseyed about it. Well maybe a BKV ellenőr will, but it's kind of a workplace requirement for them :)

true,charlofsweden,SWED,Stockholm,"&gt; I think you're too focused on the butterfly effect. When talking about counterfactual history it's usually best to just assume that things would end up roughly the same if history happened again, unless you can find specific reasons otherwise. Which is obviously not true, but reality is that we have absolutely no idea how history would have turned out.

For the sake of writing a story and making a narrative, sure. You can't deviate too much and expect to reach a wide audience. People need familiar things to relate, that's just the way it is.

&gt; When I think about counterfactual history I try to imagine how things could have been different, not just assume that they would be. Like for example if Sweden-Norway took part in World War 1, a war I think was even more certain to happen than WW2. Perhaps the added Norwegian part made Sweden enough of a power-factor that it got involved in the war, on German side.

Yeah, I usually create a scenario and *then* look back at history and try to find alt-historical ways that scenario could've happened. I think that's the only practical way to do it, since the whole genre is pure speculation anyway (though based on history and fact.) So yeah, we can say ""how would WW1 have turned out if there was a united Norway-Sweden fighting in it?"" but we can't say for sure ""a united Norway-Sweden would've fought in WW1."" I agree that WW1 was pretty certain, but the actual war the way it broke out in our timeline couldn't possibly have happened if you change things around too much. But eventually something would have happened that caused the great powers of the day to fight, that's for sure. Norway-Sweden would probably have had a very real and definite effect. Fighting with the Central Powers it would've provided an additional front for the already stretched Russians to fight on, fighting with the Entente it would've prevented Germany from projecting naval power into the Baltic. Either way it would've had an impact.

&gt; History is fucking great.

true,yaix,EURO,EU-DE,"&gt; I don't trust neither the Greek government nor the Greek people.

That's what the austerity is for, to force them, let them no other choice than actually implementing reforms. And for the people to understand that when many steal money, then the money is actually gone.

&gt; people won't be making decisions, only arguing and discussing in a huge cloud

Until people are pissed off enough to actually tell their ""uncle who 'works' a government job"" that he is an asshole and partly responsible for the mess. Until young people start asking their parents why they are being so dishonest at the expense of their own children. Until politicians can't just offer some ""government jobs"" to angry people to make them vote for their party again.

A healthy society requires that you also tell off your own family members and friends if they are part of the corruption system. That may have personal costs. You may not get that easy-peasy gov job everybody wants. But it makes the society better.

Moving away is understandable from a personal perspective. But its a choice that will make Greece even weaker. With every good person who moves away and decides not to fight.

Just sayin'

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; As I said, GDP is far from perfect. But there's a reason why countries are ranked by that. It's one thing to manipulate statistics, redefine the meaning of some statistical terms that most people have only used in high school, etc... and another thing to manipulate the national economy to get a 5% raise.

I thought income and median were both relatively straightforward terms. Much more straightforward than GDP, if only because you make a direct link between the income of the people and the income of the politicians, instead of going through an abstract measure like GDP... and I've seen much greater divergences in GDP estimates than income estimates, anyway. How do you account for import/export, destruction, investments, loans, credit, etc.? Income, on the other hand, is simply disposable income.

&gt;Voters are supportive of these measures and voice their opinions too. Every single year the parliament increases their wages and there's a huge uproar on Facebook. But ultimately, there are easier ways of getting votes. Like a one-time pension premium (a.k.a. legal vote buying), lowering utility costs for households (and thus forcing the providers to raise the prices for large consumers, which ultimately presents itself as a raise in product prices, but it can be blamed easily onto the ""greedy bakers""), etc...

A facebook uproar is a start, but you have to prove that you are willing to take it to its conclusion.

true,rtharper,SWED,Sweden,"I can testify to the idiocy of their immigration policy on paper and in practice.  I went to Oxford as a non-EU citizen.  I started in 2007.  Almost year-on-year until I left in 2012, the required information one had to show to renew a student visa became more and more onerous.  The waiting times became longer, and they hold your passport the entire time. 

I don't come from a so-called ""suspicious country"" (a loaded term that I would say they use to justify discriminating practices against certain immigrants rather than my own views on those countries).  I also saw the ability for highly skilled, educated students stay after their degrees to look for jobs.  I saw people with degrees from top UK universities driven home by rising income requirements, the dismantling of routes to transition from a student to a work visa, and an increasing sense of unwelcome in any interactions with government authorities (including a time when the NHS attempted to deny medical care despite the fact that I was legally resident and willing to prove it). 

The sponsorship process for a company to hire a non-EU citizen has become worse and worse, and the only option left to manyis to work for a large company or a bank in the City, as all medium-sized businesses were essentially pushed out of this process.  I had larger companies attempt to lower salary offers based on sponsorship.

Ultimately, after watching several of my friends suffer the same sadness, including being separate from long-term relationships by these policies.  I left.  Not back to my country, but to another European country (Sweden), where I was welcomed with open arms.  I was aggressively recruited by companies, and my work permit process took about 24 hours for a preliminary reply stating it was approved.

London is perhaps the most global city in the world.  The tech industry, where small and medium business look for quick and easy hiring of qualified professionals and attempt to adopt low-cost and lean processes, are already giving up on this hostile environment because hiring any non-EU citizen who is globally competitive is such a headache. 

I find this at odds with the fact that the UK exports its citizens all over the world, often taking advantage of youth visas to experience the world and work in a huge number of countries.  This inward looking attitude will cost both their citizens and their economy dearly.  Applications to many UK universities have dropped as the exorbitant cost of international fees, usually considered worth it, suddenly seems less worth the bother.

Now you have to understand: we don't hear a lot about Ukraine in the media.

He and his crimes were visible in our media all the time and we saw time and time again how he evaded justice. Maybe this is also the picture you have of Tymoshenko and maybe that is even correct.

End result is that public services stay shit, forever. That's regardless of the immigrant population being a net provider of wealth through taxation.

Le Figaro is one the main French newspapers. It's well-established and right-leaning. The article seem to be [on their website too, though only for subscribers](http://www.lefigaro.fr/mon-figaro/2013/08/01/10001-20130801ARTFIG00277-gallipoli-le-bapteme-de-feu-des-australiens-et-des-neo-zelandais.php). Moreover maybe you'd rather have a paper version?

So [here is their online boutique](http://boutique.lefigaro.fr/rayon/26-achat-au-numero?brand=1). The daily newspaper does not seem available though. There's a link to [this picture](http://boutique.lefigaro.fr/assets/visuals/frais_de_livraison-3b2117f735fe79642865654553c4223d.jpeg) which shows the shipping costs: 23€ for you (Oceania). So the *do* ship to your place, the problem is ordering the daily newspaper.

On [that page](http://www.lefigaro.fr/divers/2007/10/29/06-20071029ARTWWW00234-mentions-legales-et-droits.php), under ""Numéro récents"" is written that you can contact them to buy a paper copy of any of the papers published over the last 6 months. 1.90€.

So what you'll want to do, I think, it contact them at the given number (*Tel: +33 1 57 08 71 10/ 08 *) on Monday morning (I could do it for you if you want) and ask them for it. If everything goes a I expect, you'll pay 25€ and receive the newspaper within a few weeks.

I checked [on La Poste website](http://www.laposte.fr/Particulier/Utiliser-nos-outils-pratiques/Outils-et-documents/Calculez-le-tarif-de-vos-envois) and one of us sending it to you would be at least 3 euros more expensive.

If you don't want that hassle you can get it for 1€ (web subscription) I think on Le Figaro's website.

I hope it helped!

We don't need 27 different opinions.

I do not blame Europe for trouble in Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Ireland... I blame how Europe was build and the lack of initiative to a more integrated Europe. 

What kind of more integrated Europe? Good question, at least some discussion among nations and citizens on what kind of Europe are we looking for will be a good start. But, speaking for France, we hear more and more skepticism toward Europe from both politicians and citizens. The problem for those people: Bruxelles, the Euro, those officials from Bruxelles, the power they hold while they are not elected... Are they to blame? Sure they have their responsibilities, but in the end who control the budget, the debt, the fiscal policy, the social policy? Who built the Europe, the Euro? Nations, parliament, elected officials from sovereign nation! They are those who are really to blame.

But hey, those guys are smart ass: let's blame it on the Euro it's good populist policy and it works on the short term (politician only care about short term, i.e. the next elections).

* Roughly 10 million people.

* It seems like some right-wing populists have been getting more footing in your nation recently, but I might be wrong about that.

* When the Ottomans were invading Europe in the 1500s and 1600s, Hungary fell under Ottoman rule for decades. After that, they fell under Austrian rule.

* They had a revolution in 1848 when they tried to free themselves of Austria. They lost, but the nation became Austria-Hungary.

* They were on the losing side of both World Wars.

* After World War I, there was a short lived socialist republic led by Bela Kun.

* During World War II, they fought with Germany. They took parts of Slovakia and modern day Ukraine, but lost it back when the Soviets came. Their monarchy ended with Soviet rule for obvious reasons.

* In 1956, Hungary tried to kick out the Soviet rule. It didn't end well for them, and Soviet units were sent to Hungary.

* That uprising, however, allowed Hungary to have more freedoms, economic and personal. It is known informally as Goulash Communism here, but I doubt you call it that. :p

* Hungary is now an EU nation.

* You don't click your glasses when toasting due to some massacre that happened.

* You have a strong relationship with Poland.

* A weird as hell language that is related to Finnish and some minor Russian languages. 

* Hungary had ruled over Slovakia for centuries, and it has bred some animosity between the two.

* Great food. Paprikash is my favorite food. While goulash is the most popular in America, there is obviously plenty more, and it's wonderful.

* From what I've seen, an amazingly beautiful nation.

Public services responding to demographic change is a problem that will exist whether immigration occurs or not.  And what do you mean by ""mass immigration""? That sounds like some sort of scare word designed to conjure an image people suddenly and uncontrollable moving into Britain.  Is that happening? Do you have any figures that demonstrate this sudden and uncontrollable flood?

Do you have any figures to show up next tax income/benefit? Immigrants who come after their education who are also employed have had a large portion of their dependence on public funds paid for by someone else.  How are they not, then, less likely at that age not to be net providers of tax revenue? Let's also be clear, the narrative that immigrants come as benefit tourists [has been shown to be false](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/20/truth-about-benefit-tourism).  

I fail to see the economic argument to simply shutting off immigration.  You could not come from outside the EU before 2007 without a work permit, either, or if you could only for relatively short periods in which you were allowed the seek work.

The US organization I work for is called CRU and in Hungary it is called Timóteus Társaság Alapítvány. (They are independent of one another legally but work together if that makes sense.)

I grew up in the US during the cold war and this part of the world always held a lot of fascination for me. In 2008 I attended a conference in Tihány (in the winter - a little odd) and I fell in love with the place. Through a series of different events we found out there was an opening for us here, and we were able to move here in 2011.

After getting here I found out that my great-grandparents on my father's side were from Hungary, though I don't think they were ethnically Hungarian. But learning that, a lot of stuff about my family, how I grew up and my own cultural values made a lot of sense. I really enjoy living here and I'm working on trying to track down the documentation that might make it possible for me to gain citizenship. But I'm learning the details of all that would imply right now so I think it is a little while off. I'm not in a rush as we haven't had any issues getting residency permits.

The people in my office are from all over - so we operate in English. This is problematic for me as it's made it harder for me to learn Hungarian. I'm talking to my boss now to see if I can find a way to work my schedule so that I can spend more time on it. I've been here two years but I can't carry on a conversation.

I really knew nothing about Hungary before I visited. Once I did visit, I loved it. I've tried to learn about the history and culture as much as I can. Though there is so much to learn I pick up new things every day.

I had a Hungarian flag for my flair here, but I switched it. On the one hand I identify strongly with Hungary and I live there, but at the same time I realize it might make people think I'm Hungarian but really I'm not.

My kids love it here as well. My son is 10 and when he has his ""When I grow up ..."" discussions with me he always talks about living in Hungary.

My wife loves it too - but has a hard time with the winters. Before this she lived in Arizona, Florida and Ghana. She really likes the sun and warm temperatures. She's really happy right now, I'm already looking forward to the fall when things cool off.

Way more than you wanted to know, I'm sure. But the security guard didn't show up at the office and now I'm hanging out until the other guy gets here and I can go home.",0,1375461603,null,0,false,0,cbfl1pk,t3_1jjq5q,t1_cbfl1pk,t1_cbfkcmt,null,1429969070,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

What I mean by mass immigration is large scale population changes in a specific area. The UK might have 60 million people and only 500k immigrants per year (http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/cross-cutting-topics/migration/index.html) but those people aren't getting spread out, most of them are going to the same places. Which means that in terms of local population vs immigration in those places it truly does look like mass immigration.

It's specious to twist the immigrant argument into being about educated professionals. They make up a tiny portion of the immigrant population and nobody is saying they don't pay their way eventually. Although even for that group if they happen to need medical attention, schooling for children, emergency services, etc then they haven't actually paid for the use of those yet in taxes. Of course if they stay long enough then you'd expect them to catch up.

The more worrying group is, for example, a family with two children and a stay at home mother with the father working minimum wage. That family is an economic loss for a minimum of at least one generation, probably more.

I'd agree that there isn't a strong economic argument against immigration by professionals. There is however a good argument that allowing immigration to fill gaps in professions leads to underinvestment in local training/education. You can see this happening with professions like medicine and engineering where because doctors/engineers can be imported (especially from Europe) there is no pressure to increase the number of places for training/education available to the native population.",0,1375463546,null,0,false,0,cbflt99,t3_1jjru6,t1_cbflt99,t1_cbfkm02,null,1429968714,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

La magistratura sta perdendo, non perchè non ha condannato Berlusconi, ma perchè non ha giocato d'astuzia.

L'ideale per distruggere uno come Berlusconi è creargli un opponente ad hoc (che al momento non esiste) dato che lui è un industriale, uno di quelli con i paraocchi che si appoggia a destra e a manca e piano piano è arrivato in cima. Gli va creato il vuoto intorno, va fatto rimanere solo *e lì* abbatterlo, in modo da creare una destra più sana e formare una sinistra che abbia un capo e una coda. 

In poche parole, la magistratura secondo me ha fatto bene ma allo stesso tempo s'è tirata la zappa sui piedi: adesso usciranno fuori ottocentomila polemiche sulle varie vicende insabbiate dalla magistratura e dai media, tipo lo scandalo monte dei paschi, tutte le truffe delle COOP eccetera, danneggiando magistratura e sinistra e probabilmente portando ad una riforma della magistratura nel lungo termine.

EDIT: vorrei aggiungere che ho notato un temibile rovescio della medaglia nei due casi in cui

1. La magistratura è coperta in questo, il fatto che siano bersagli politici può essere come può non essere: il problema non è che la magistratura indaga i politici incastrandoli, è che la maggioranza dei politici è truffaldina di natura e la magistratura (o almeno gli individui con interessi politici al suo interno) *è probabile* che ne approfittino. Non ci sono prove e mai ci saranno, è una serie di *se* e *ma* da complottari e non porta mai da nessuna parte purtroppo.

2. Il popolo non odia berlusconi, perchè altrimenti non faceva il 25% alle scorse elezioni. Il popolo informato lo odia perchè da una parte ci sono dei media che lo idolatrano come se fosse gesù cristo, e dall'altra ci sono personaggi che si fanno tondi con l'antiberlusconismo. E come in tutte le cose la gente prende le parti, e chi ha (=internet) si fa sentire di più. Ecco perchè sembra che venga odiato da tutti, perchè solo loro hanno l'intelligenza di farsi sentire. Inoltre l'aver versato milioni di euro nelle casse dello stato è un suo dovere da cittadino italiano, non è che allora io che verso mille euro di tasse devo essere giudicato in modo diverso da lui: se fa le cazzate paga come tutti.

It's one of the worst EU rules, to be honest. The intention is to reduce nepotism, corruption, and stimulate market forces, but it's not executed very well.

I think your way of thinking is that, you probably see as ""The Crown"" as a government posistion and department.

If I shut down a department of government like a post office or something (I'm bad at examples), the post office's property still belongs to the government. 

It's not the same case with the Crown though

So, the idea of having The Crown as a corporation is to separate The Royal Family's property from government property.

The main reason is that we don't live in a world of equal regions or indeed equal countries. What we have is a world of superpowers. As Europeans we need to acknowledge that we have as our neighbor a giant that is still not politically of economically stable. While I don't feel threatened by Russia, it's clear from how they handle Belarus, Ukraine and Central Asia that the main interest of Russian foreign policy is Russian dominance in it's own neighborhood. 

In addition to Russia, we have our southeastern and southern (beyond the mediterranean sea) neighbors, who have huge potential in terms of population and resources, but are also the most unstable regions in the world at the moment. Beyond these we have the rising eastern powers of China and India.

My point is that in our world of superpowers, unified Europe will be much better equipped to keep our corner of the world afloat and, quite importantly in my opinion, provide an alternative to the currently most globally visible political systems of the US and Russia (personality cults) and China (secretive, bloated, frankly quite undemocratic and controlling).

tl;dr a unified Europe might seem like a step in the direction of protectionism, but I support it because the current superpowers seem intent to step on everyone else just to create or keep their hegemonies.

So far, luckily, the other parties have refused to acknowledge the politics of the Sweden Democrats and refuse to see them as a legitimate party to ally with.  Time will tell if this is the case when a block would be made or broken by including them, but I'm hopeful.

There do exist media sources that constantly question the rhetoric of Sweden Democrats and their ""facts"", which are often true but misused to suit their purpose.  They have, as you said, though, made greater strides in the past few years, and the last polls I read put them at more popular than during the last election =/  

The rise of populism during economic downturns is not surprising, but I think it would be very damaging were it allowed to occur unabated.  I don't think the Swedish media is without fault, but I think they have done a better job than the British and US media in preventing politicians from completely steering national debates in the direction they want without question.

true,ThePhlogist,ENGL,England,"Most of the economic problems you mention arose recently, were exacerbated by a lack of co-operation not by too much and have coincided with the shift of wealth from west to east. A decrease in profitability world wide should be expected - the US has similarly decreased. 

Secondly, being in favour of the EU or European co-operation is not the same as being a federalist. If federalism happens it will not happen or should it happen for at least 50 years. I'm not hugely in favour (though most of the perceived downsides are either economic and thus would disappear in a federal system or focus on some sort of loss of state identity which any look a the US would prove incorrect). If a non-federal international common market in work and trade can be formed that is all I could want. A common market required some unification of regulation which necessarily will come from above though the EU often uses directives allowing EU states to draft the legislation themselves thus reducing unnecessary bureaucracy. More of that would be good. Waste and inefficiency are not fatal flaws but ones to be solves. It's not worth in my eyes throwing away my ability to live and work in another country for these minor reasons especially if my own country decides to do something stupid like spy on all my digital communications and censor the Internet...y'know...crazy stuff. 

I don't understand why you don't think it has any democratic legitimacy? Every person in Europe has both a vote and a representative in the EP. No doubt the influence of the commission and it's ambitious expansionism is a bit worrying and this is one area where the EU can overstep it's boundaries. I find it unsettling the the Commission is so keen to keep including country after country into the EU. This pushes up the cost of the EU adds to people's concerns about east to west migration and about economic stability. However again this should be solved within the EU. I don't want to lose my own rights because of a solvable problem. The EP should have more power and the people should be ale to dictate Europe's direction not the commissioners nor selfish national politicians. 

The EU currently costs about half a percent of our budget (3.8 billion from 668 billion public spending) and for that I have the entirety of Europe to make my life and to travel in and (were I a business owner) to trade with/in. I really do think it is value for money. Being part of our multicultural group makes me feel solidarity with people who for centuries my ancestors hated viciously. I really like the fact that we can trust each other, that we can benefit each other and create something bigger and better than we started. I'm aware that from a Libertarian viewpoint bigger and better are oxymorons but by bigger I don't necessarily mean more centralised or more expensive. There are changes we can make to the EU to make it into an organisation that effectively acts as a way to improve our national experiences not to worsen it or replace it. We can improve standards so that when I buy electronics or food from Croatia or Spain and I see that CE sign, I know it will be as good as anything bought at home. We can improve living and working conditions both of which remain a problem at the bottom of even the richest societies. We can improve transport and infrastructure; we already lead the way in Internet infrastructure (except parts of Asia) and the EU's focus on improving our infrastructure is part of encouraging that. Now the UK may well have done that anyway but many other countries would never have been able to and in just the same way I want to see parts of my own country I don't even live in improved so I want to see other places in Europe flourish and for Europe to be a better place on the whole for it. Putting the political power in the hands of the people is essential to making the EU more democratic and is something I hope to see soon. 

In other words I see many benefits to co-operation through the EU and the downsides are mostly minor problems which are either temporary or simply solved if we even for a moment put some effort into solving them.

I completely agree. Without the hasty fiscal/monetary integration countries like Germany and the entire Eurozone would not have been dragged into what would have been an isolated crisis. It forced other European nations to deal with issues that would have normally been handled at the national level. And as you said, the traditional national remedy would be devaluation, which is no longer available. The Euro certainly has its place, but admission should have been based on a country's fundamentals as opposed to the desire for a United States of Europe.

The point of the article, I believe, is that such hostility is not limited to illegal immigrants. The aim to reduce immigration could be legitimate if done with some tact and intelligence. Instead they seem to to be trying to scare people away with threats of arrest, harsh burdens on legal immigrants from poor 'high risk' nations or simply trying to make the entire country look unattractive. 

Telling the streets of London to go home or face arrest is quite a hostile attitude that is intimidating and aggressive to legal immigrants and merely expected by illegal immigrants. Nothing is gained and much is lost. Having people like Nigel Farage claiming the signs in London are bad not because they are insensitive or needlessly aggressive but because in his own words they are still 'flooding in at Dover' does to help either.

- EU is flawed and not a real democracy because member states prevent it from being one. We have a flawed compromise between government on a national and a European level.

- EU is very accountable, just mostly to the national governments. Popular accountability is small because that would mean somewhat proper European government and reduce national sovereignty.

- *""Bloated and incredibly wasteful""*. I would ask you for sources. I very much doubt this is true. The EU commission, dislike it as much as you want, works with top-educated people. They don't just take anyone. Compared to many national civil administrations it's elitist and lean.

- *""Intrusive""*. It is not intrusive because EU guidelines and directives are deliberately loose and lax to accommodate a wide range of national laws. And these minimal guidelines are not randomly put into place by the EU Commission (it doesn't have that much power, contrary to what you hear in the British press) but are passed and decided by the national governments (in the form of the Council of the EU and the European Council).

---

**My arguments pro EU**

- The EU is a vision of a truly united Europe where we delegate political tasks to the level most suited to them. Big issues should be dealt with on a European level, national issues on a national level and small issues on local or regional level. Some issues simply cannot be dealt with on national levels any more and this is showing now.

- Deriving from the last point: Europe is weak and divided on an international scale if we are not united in policy. It won't be perfect, we need a lot of compromise. But guess what, that is exactly what democracy is. Compromise. You can't just govern to your heart's content, you have to deal with different interests and ideologies. We need international weight to protect our interests in the world. The EU needs to be that.

- This is more personal, but I grew up and lived in different countries. I feel European. I don't think there is all that much that divides us. We have common history and heritage, we have common culture, we have in many cases a common political culture (not uniform, but influenced by each other). I love that we have common civil rights in the EU, that we can move anywhere, work anywhere and have open borders.

- We have common ideals: **Everyone should be able to live their life freely, protected by society, treated fairly and able to pursue one's dreams. Disadvantaged people should be helped and a minimum standard of living ensured, not for free but if you are engaged you will be helped.""** That seems like a pretty good summary of what most Europeans would agree to (I think).

---

One last thought... European unity will not be easy. It's very hard and tiresome work because we have been politically divided for so long. And politics on a European level won't please everyone, but we have the chance to stop thinking supremely as ""protecting national interests"" and instead think like we do in national politics: by political interest.

true,parigot,ZZZZphilippines,Philippines,"French universities are very different according to whether you are in an elite one or an ordinary one. You probably won't like an ordinary one because French universities (I speak from experience) are a nasty shock for the average American student spoiled by teachers who listen and praise their students, administrators who are well organized, and a pleasant physical campus. Instead you are likely to face a single large, often ugly building with dreary out-of-date classrooms, overcrowded and dirty classes, libraries and cafeterias, ridiculous schedules, teachers who do not value interaction with students and have no office hours (and are state employees almost impossible to fire), no place to meet other students, who often leave right after class, and a lack of communication from the administration. Your inability to find out any useful information online is actually 100% typical of how French universities operate. Your best bet on that is to find out someone's name at each institution you're interested in and write directly to that person. 

Your best bet IMHO is either Sciences Po which has a special entry for foreigners and is very prestigious in France, or possibly the less high-pressure program in French at the Sorbonne. If you are interested in business you could also think about applying to HEC which is an elite school that is more open to foreigners than other French universities. 

If you decide to go the regular French university route, make sure you visit first, find out when classes are held (Friday nights? Saturday afternoons?), how students are informed of things (very important: they often expect you to find crucial things out completely on your own), who the teachers are, what subjects you will actually be allowed to study, how and when to sign up for classes (don't be half an hour late!), how big the classes are and where they are held, when vacations are, etc. 

Another thing you could do is just sign up for a year at the Alliance Française or the Institut Catholique de Paris (many non-Catholics), which I have heard good things about from foreign students.

It's quite hard to get a job in France unless your French is excellent AND you have working papers. Don't forget that English is not enough because everyone in the U.K. and Ireland has the right to work here without any fuss, so an employer is not likely to help you get a visa. I believe full-time university students can work if they have a student visa but this is easier said than done. France is in a bad recession and even well-qualified, well-connected French students are having trouble getting jobs in places like Paris. Also don't underestimate how expensive Paris is.

Most people are unaware that Russia is very much still playing the old games and that currently Ukraine and Georgia (and others) are being forcibly disrupted to prevent a closer association with the EU.  

While Georgia required physical intervention, the Ukraine is being shaped by powerful business interests and manipulative oligarchs.  The 2004/2007 expansions were preemptive maneuvers to carve the sphere of influence in favor of Europe.  

Frankly I find it to be very heartening, that a state more powerful than any single other one in Europe is having its ambitions curtailed by a union of the remainder.  We will bear the costs of this premature integration, but it may even be too late for some of the remaining states.

I consider myself not a libertarian but a liberal, meaning I, too, am somewhat suspicious against collective bodies.Not fanatically, I not so naive to want the state to just go away to leave me at the mercy of powerful out of control non-state actors. I also am perfectly fine with the idea that the strong should support the weak. So I'm no libertarian. But I'm rather uneasy with the state intruding my personal life. Especially when it claims to execute the will of the people. First, this is bullshit anyway, since most people most of the time only want to drink their beer in peace. Second, it is the very nature of human rights that they cannot be overridden even by the (fictious) will of the (imagined) majority.

The phrase ""national sovereignty"" or ""sovereign nations"" rings all kind of alarm bells for me. Because in my experience it is pulled mostly by elites that don't like the fact that they aren't able to do with the people or some people what they would like to do with the people or some people. The EU adds another layer of governance, another set of checks of balances, not adding intrusion but making state intrusion somewhat less easy even in cases where all national players think this would be a wonderful idea. When I'm at home, I'm never fully at mercy of the German state and when I'm in Britain, I'm never fully at mercy of the British state. And that is a wonderful thing. I could give concrete examples from the basics of the basics, namely the four freedoms (meaning the EU *prevents* protectionism, at least inside the internal market) to lots of decisions of the ECJ or ECHR (which isn't a EU institution but also a supranational body limiting state power).

true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"&gt;Alright, I'm only here to educate myself more on why you guys have your opinions on this matter. As I am genuinely interested to know why.

Cool.

&gt;As a big Euroscpetic and someone from a Libertarian perspective, for me the EU represents everything that is wrong with politics. Not only do I want my country the UK to leave, but I want the thing to break and dissolve into the history books.

Later on you write about protectionism and how you dislike it. But here you'd prefer to re-erect borders and barriers? I don't see the logic.

&gt;In my view, and as expressed by many others, the EU has no accountability, no democratic legitimacy, it is bloated, it is incredibly wasteful, it is incredibly intrusive, and it works within a failing currency.

The EU employs fewer people than any larger European city, be it Cologne or London. Its budget is around €120bn/yr, which is tiny in comparison to national or regional governments. It is not bloated or wasteful. Its parliament is just as elected as any national parliament, its ""upper chamber"", the council, consists of our national governments. The commission is appointed by our governments and confirmed by parliament. I don't *really* see how that is less democratic. It's as intrusive as its mandate allows it to be so that it can do its job – well, not intrusive enough, actually. Some things aren't working because they are left to the national governments and they're stuck in a huge prisoner dilemma.

&gt;Bearing these things in mind, why do you support it so much? Why do you reject the idea of free sovereign nations that trade and cooperate with each over and can have all the benefits without being in a political union?

We can't really trade freely if our trading rules differ. With the EU's single market I know that what I produce in Portugal can be sold in Germany, the UK, everywhere. That requires certain political unity. Bilateral agreements between the 28 member states (and the rest) would truly be a bureaucratic nightmare, way worse than our current arrangement.

&gt; What gives you hope that this idea of a federal Europe will succeed despite being the only continent on earth that is not growing, and where its share of world GDP Has fallen from almost 40% in the 1970's, to a predicted 15% in less than 7 years time. What makes you think in the age of globalisation that protectionism can work?

I think your argument is flawed since Europe used to be way ahead of (much of) the rest of the world and now they are catching up. It's perfectly normal for our share to decline. That said, what evidence of excessive protectionism do you have? I think the combined strength of the European economies allows us to adequately respond to protectionism by other blocs.

&gt;What gives you hope that there can be such thing as a federal Europe, when the Southern American countries, which have many similar cultures, and same languages, politely rejected all the ideas of federalism despite the wishes of the EU, and that it can work in this part of the world where there is a vast array and a massive collaboration of different linguistics and cultures.

It depends very much on what you think when you say ""federal."" I think of a common foreign and defence policy and an integrated economy. Research, too. Not (lower) education, not culture, anything else can stay with the states. I don't see why that shouldn't work: Europeans, by virtue of geography alone, have similar foreign policy and security goals.

For any student that does a language in my university (and for most universities I know of in the UK, perhaps not all), their 3rd year of study is generally spent either studying in a university in the country of their chosen language, or on a work placement.

 If you choose to study at a (foreign) university, your home university will provide you a list of so called 'partner' universities that it would already have exchange links with, for example I was given the choice between Barcelona, Valencia, Granada, Seville, Cáceres, amongst a few others. You provide a shortlist to the university and based on demand (and perhaps some other criteria like grades etc) you are granted a place in one of these universities.

 From there, the University tends to walk students through the application process (such as choosing modules and signing 'learning agreements' with the other uni). After all the administrative work is finished, it is generally the students responsibility to organise accommodation, which can be done either by viewing and organising online, or by arriving a few weeks in advance and staying in a hostel while going house-hunting! 

With work placement, it is the same sort of process except rather than being given a list of partner unis, you have to find work placement yourself. This option tends to be more taxing and requires the student to be a lot more organised, which I most certainly am not!

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"The short answer, as you can see from some of the replies, is that 'europhiles' fundamentally disagree with your characterisation of the EU. As such, the question ""why do you support the EU"", with the implied ""when I don't"" answers itself - they're looking at a different EU. Nobody would support the EU *you* think you see.

The proper questions, then, are why you see such a different EU, and whether you're right. Now, to be honest, it's hard to see why *anyone* would create, or continue working on, or with, the EU you think you see, including those governments which evidently do so (including the UK's government), which suggests either a fantastical answer (that is, a conspiracy or some other insanely powerful hidden force), or that you're wrong. My money is on the latter.

I appreciate that's maybe not the most flattering of answers, but it's logical - either (a) the EU only exists by virtue of some mad conspiracy, or (b) it's not what you think it is. Assuming we can leave aside (a), which is not always going to be the case on the interwebs, we have (b), and the question becomes why you have such a distorted view of the EU?

The simple answer to that has also already been given - the UK press and political classes have spent the best part of the 40 years since they joined painting the EU as exactly what you believe it to be, while simultaneously (and presumably mysteriously, to a UK eurosceptic) not leaving it.

Out of interest, has it ever occurred to you to follow that bit of logic through, and wonder why the UK has never left and the EU continues to exist despite apparently being the worst thing ever?",0,1375483935,null,0,false,0,cbftjoa,t3_1jkyjx,t1_cbftjoa,t3_1jkyjx,null,1429965034,20,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,20

Ok so let's make Europe more accountable, more democratic, less bloated, less wasteful and less intrusive. These are fair worries for any large organisation and things that all of us are concerned about. We have the minds, so let's improve how Europe functions. I don't think anyone is against making it into the best possible Europe we could possibly come up with.

I'm an American, so admittedly, I'm not familiar with a lot of the workings of the EU, so I can't comment on much of [/u/Cameron94's](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cameron94) criticisms.

I do however, feel qualified to say that this analysis is correct. Sorry, but compared to America, the UK (and every EU country by itself) just doesn't matter on a global scale. The UK/NATO follow American foreign policy because the US demands it. And until they provide an alternative to NATO (or at least becomes unified enough that they don't care what the US says), they are going to continue to be puppets.

Examples:

* Julian Assange. Nowhere else in the world would I be able to find an example of a country threatening to storm an embassy for someone wanted for a domestic crime, and you have the US to thank for that.

* Gary McKinnon.

* British Guantanamo detainees. ~~Do you think the US would have even dared to take a Chinese or Russian citizen as a detainee? And how many UK detainees were and there and how long did it take to release them?~~
Yeah, this is wrong, as I've discovered. There were Chinese and Russian nationals.

* The whole incident with Evo Morales' plane getting grounded is scary, quite frankly. It clearly illustrated that the power the US has on other countries, and it also clearly showed that the US does not care that it will cause political fallout for them.

Now both groups have completed 2 years of language study and are going on Erasmus years. We're both getting the exact same treatment and experience 

Erasmus is about getting that opportunity to become more fluent in a language. The idea is that regardless of what level you're at before you leave, a year of studying, socialising and living in that language lets you become more knowledgable and (most importantly) comfortable in the language.

I hate Christianity and Judaism, but that doesn't mean I hate all Christians or Jews, or that I hate Italians or Hebrews; I try to judge a person on a individual basis which racists, homophobes, xenophobes, etc. fail to do.  I think it will take some time, but Islam will water itself down and become more moderate (i.e. less of itself) as Christianity and Judaism did in the West.  The Islamic countries will remain a problem however and therefore emigration of these people with ancient ideas (like the Christians stupid and simple enough to believe in demons) will be a problem and need to be prevented from influencing the political atmosphere.  I don't want to live in a country where Conservative Religiosity in any country are allowed to take away individual rights simply because lunacy has become the majority - which of-course has been the case for the large majority of human history.

To summarize, I think Europe has been far too tolerate with religious fundamentalism (and State Churches like in Denmark should be removed immediately) and that Islam is a problem but to a lesser extent so is ""Islamaphobia"" or hating a person because they're of a different faith.  But I would describe this as a problem with Christians, Jews, Hindus, not Secularists and Atheists who seem to understand the distinction and the correct ""balance"" though it really isn't balancing anything.  All we can do is offer children of Islamic parents ( I refuse to call them Muslim children, just as I refuse to call children of Catholics Catholic children ) decent secular education where critical thinking is praised over faith and stupidity and give these people economic incentives to work in fields of intelligence.  Since educated and prosperous countries are the most-likely to adopt Secular and Liberal attitudes.

true,MrBubblesworth,BULG,Bulgaria,"I'm a Bulgarian living in the States, so that's how I'm a little biased fyi. I'll try to address your complaints in sequential order as how they appear.

1 I would argue that the EU exhibits a democratic deficit because the individual EU states do not want the EU to have a public mandate, and be able to increase its power at the expense of the nation states. The people who are in charge of the EU are career bureaucrats with minimal ambitions and that's intentional (I also think that it's also something like a purgatory where you can exile politicians, but correct me on that).

The EU as an organization has only like [38,000 employees, and spends about 6% of its budget on administrative costs.](http://europa.eu/about-eu/facts-figures/administration/index_en.htm) Additionally, the EU budget is slightly over [1% of GDP.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_the_European_Union) At least in my little opinion, I think that's relatively efficient. I'd image some British ministries are much more ""bloated"" but that's another topic.

2 I honestly believe that the political union brings some sort of stability to the whole of Europe (at least in the Balkans). That's kinda hard to prove one way or the other, take that with a grain of salt.

Free and sovereign nations can engage in free trade. But let me ask you this question, if they are so willing and able to do that, then why haven't they already? Not to mention that all countries agree to joining the EU, and all countries agreed to accepting subsequent countries. The EU and the EEA provides a legal and formal framework for helping to integrate economies and removing trade barriers (something I'd assume a libertarian would be OK with), and it allows small countries like Bulgaria to gain favorable terms in free trade agreements with other countries simply because it is in the EU. Also, other countries which are not part of the EU do also participate in the common market (Norway, Switzerland, etc.). In addition, the Shengen treaty provides for free movement of peoples, and even non Shengen-country citizens can live and work in other European countries. This kind of liberalization of movement is unprecedented, and it is because there is a framework for developing and harmonizing governmental controls and standards that this can happen. (Freedom of movement is another libertarian point.)

Growing in what way? is my first question. Let me flip the question, can Europe afford to not federalize and harmonize its political and economic systems in the face of developing third-world countries? (I would also explain some of the decreasing share of world GDP as impoverished countries developing much faster than European countries over the last 40 years. Also I don't know how you got those numbers, so I don't know if the entire USSR's economy was ""European"" just saying.)

3 Much of the objections to the EU are the same objections that were posed to the new American constitution proposed in 1787. I think that a more federal Europe could have avoided the sovereign debt crises by imposing more controls on national budgets. (I think governments spending within their means is another huge libertarian point.) 

And I don't know what you're talking about with South American countries dismissing political integration. There are two more [continental unions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_union). These countries are attempting to integrate economically (and in Africa the AU I'm sure provides some sort of political stability). Keep in mind that the European Union didn't spring up over night, just because South America (which did draft a [pan continental treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutive_Treaty) and Africa aren't at the same stage of political integration now doesn't mean that they won't in the future.

I think the multiple cultures and multiple languages argument is not that good of an argument. America has many different cultures and regions (including Native American reservations) with many different opinions on governance, yet America still exists despite all of our internal arguments. Switzerland has 4 languages; China is also very culturally diverse and has many different spoken languages; the same applies to India and Russia. 

And just to add a little elaboration on my points: giving more power to a government doesn't automatically mean that that power is coming at an expense of your liberties. Safety, economic progress, and national accountability might require national governments or individuals to give up some liberties, but the liberties that they provide are very important  and probably increase the quality of life and are liberties themselves. 

Also much of the weakness of the EU is because it's sort of a half-assed attempt at real political integration.

UK prime ministers definitely come under fire for this but not so much Merkel.

The crown properties are not the personal property of the monarch or the royal family. If the crown ceases to be then the owner no longer exists. Just as if a government (some forms of government are another type of corporation sole) ceases to be the government properties do not revert to the ownership of the last person to hold title to the office. They belong to the new government.

They're a weird type of corporation. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_sole

But a corporation nonetheless.
They organized this ages ago to differentiate between ""government property"" and ""property of the crown"". The 2 are completely different things.

So, what happens: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland don't recognize the Crown as the Queen of the United kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. They take the Queen off the money, scrap any salaries the UK gives the Royal Family.

And the Royal Family gets all the profits from the land back.

That's how the current deals are set up.

In the aftermaths, really. In 68, the parliamentary elections have shown support of him isntead of support to the rioters, so he repressed the protests. However, he was old, and understood that his support in the population was only temporary (one famous quote from him: ""no one should accept presidency after 60""). One of his fears was to become like Petain: war hero then dictator. he checked if he was still popular enough to push down some constitutional reforms, and decided to step down, at 78. 

&gt; I've always really admired how he conducted himself during WW2 though

The fact that France was considered to be on the victorious  side at the end of the war was largely his doing. The fact that France even existed after 1945, was not even granted. Before he officially deserted to create the France Libre, the government had been proposing to make France a part of United Kingdom in exchange of British military protection. Things could have been totally different.

&gt; It seems like he did a lot to reestablish France's place in the world- even when that meant distancing France from the U.S.- after the war.

He claims in his memoirs that both sides (US and USSR) have thanked him for that, giving them a neutral ground and making the game a bit more complicated than a nuclear dick contest. Because France decided to not be part of NATO, a lot of peace conference could be organized in Paris.

* tax related (registered and approved churches in some countries don't pay taxes)
* related to accomodation in state hospitals, prisons etc.  (special meals, religious service provided by priests...)
* army related (the same advantages as the prison ones)
* marriage related (the church gets the right to marry people and the marriage will be recongined by state)
* confession related (the priests of reg. and appr. churches must not reveal anything that was shared with them as part of a confession, except for planning of a crime)

And to be able to benefit from the 2nd type of religious rights, the church needs to be stable (10 years in the CZE), have a certain amount of members (10 000 in CZE) and the CZE also requires them to reveal their finances.

Some smaller towns have some kind of social housing, but the big cities (including Bucharest) have no such thing. 

From what I read, the homeless people are either:

* orphans who were kicked out of the orphanages after reaching the age of 18
* children running away from abusive alcoholic parents in the countryside
* divorced working-class men with no place to stay after getting kicked out by their spouse
* middle-class (almost always childless) elderly people who got their house illegally taken away from them
* people with various mental illnesses

Madre-Figlio-Figlia sono vestiti in modo elegante per un americano, gli americani ci ammirano moltissimo per il nostro senso dell'estetica. Non c'è nessun Padre con i baffi alla SuperMario che grida pizza pizza con la coppola e la macchia di olio sulla canotta, e non c'è nessuna donna coperta di nero che urla (vedi l'ultimo film di Allen su Roma).

Il venditore dice con trasporto che gli mancheranno, salutandoli col bacetto e un ""ciao"", che fa molto italiano, mentre all'inizio gli acquirenti sono piuttosto perplessi e imbarazzati da questa feature, mentre nell'arco dello spot piano piano si ricrederanno, come nei più classici percorsi narrativi.

Parte il primo discorso della famiglia che verte - guarda un po' - sulla trasandatezza, mostrando una mamma un po' apprensiva, tipicamente italiana (forse agli occhi nostri tipicamente del Sud). Gli americani apprezzano il trasporto di noi italiani, ma in questa fase la coppia ancora si sente estranea.

I soldi: piccola gag in cui gli italiani pensano che con gli euro possono pagare (piccolo perculamento monetario) e insistono con gentilezza. Non ci sono occhiatacce perché tutto finisce bene col parcheggiatore è anche lui per un quarto italiano e li fa passare. Messaggio: gli italiani sono molto gentili e la gentilezza paga, anche se in effetti qua fanno un po' la figura da tordi, ma ne guadagnano in amabilità.

La scena del caffé, come ho detto prima, oltre a sancire la superiorità della tazzina sulla bibita, mostra un'altro stile di vita italiano che gli americano guardano sempre con curiosità mista ad ammirazione: il gustarsi il caffé. Se hai visto Mangia-Prega-Ama (io sotto ricatto) c'è una scena appositamente dedicata a come si prende il caffé a Roma. Ne sono quasi più consapevoli loro che noi, tant'è che di Starbucks in Italia non ne vogliono aprire.

Il pezzo dell'inversione a U esprime la caciaronità dell'italiano che urla e gesticola, ma non mi sembra sia stato mostrato in modo particolarmente negativo, solo divertente.

Altra scena sul vestirsi bene, inoltre chiedono consiglio sul mangiare, altro merito pacificamente riconosciuto al nostro popolo.

Si entusiasmano per il goal, ovviamente la correlazione calcio-Italia viene facile che ci piaccia o no, e qua per la prima volta il marito si lascia trasportare dall'entusiasmo italiano.

E qua parte la trasformazione, la coppia comincia a parlare non solo ""italiano"" (tutto loro) ma anche con lo stesso trasporto, tant'è che il trio stesso rimane tra il perplesso e divertito.

Nel finale, sono diventati italianissimi (agli occhi di un americano lol). Vestiti eleganti (che lei sia vestita da vecchia non se ne accorgerebbe nessuno in USA :P) c'è il tocco finale di romanticismo un po' latino che tanto fa presa sulle ragazze.

**Insomma**

Lungo tutto lo spot la coppia di americani, che inizia con l'essere stranita da questi intrusi per poi finire in un apprezzamento nei loro confronti, si affidano e in un certo senso piegano a loro (chiedono di cucina, portano il caffé vero), con un guadagno finale in stile e felicità. Lo spot è un'incarnazione dell'idea degli americani che in Italia si vive bene e con allegria. Se avessero voluto avrebbero potuto fare un corto commerciale sull'italiano furbone che ti vende il Colosseo con la macchina, oppure riferimenti alla mafia, Berlusconi, vendetta, ecc. ecc., invece a mio parere hanno sottolineato il meglio. Tutto nel contesto di uno spot, quindi per forza ci vanno messe le gag e semplificazioni, ma viene trasmesso un messaggio positivo sull'italianità.

Tutto IMHO eh.

True, but even, eventually we would have had this same crisis, maybe in other countries, but the same crisis again. The thing in here is that when you give enough time, any country will turn into wrong direction and go too far to make it back to a healthy condition.

What we in the Euroarea are missing is intervention mechanism that contains instruments to both help inject money into troubled country, but also take over the leadership when needed. For example in both Greece and Cyprus, what would have been needed is take over of both countries for a limited time to allow restructuring, for example over ruling constitutional protections for state workers to allow fast rebuilding of state institutions.

Um, the UK produces [the most scientific papers in the whole of Europe](http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php).  Germany is second, but it's not like it's a close-run thing, the UK by far is in the lead.  Further, [the UK's citation count](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/03/global_science_research) is also substantially higher than Germany's.  In terms of research, the UK's output is more profound than that of Germany, more far-reaching and more important.  We also get the most funding from the EU's FP7 programme and have co-ordinated the most scientific projects under that programme where such project are multinational in scope.  Again, Britain's lead there is substantial.

Ecco a me è capitato di finire nell'archivo della rivista EMPORIUM di Bergamo, pubblicata dal 1895 al 1964. 

Ho fatto questo album su imgur per condividere con /r/italy questo viaggio, alcuni marchi sono intramontabili tipo FIAT, Fernet, Richard Ginori, Pigna e Pirelli, altri marchi invece sono caduti impietosamente sotto i colpi del progresso. 

La rivista è un compendio di arte, cultura, geografia e tecnologia, anche li è evidente il progredirsi degli eventi storici, ma ho preferito focalizzarmi sulle pubblicità.

This is hilarious, as it's a nice insight into how little you know, or how you're arbitrarily picking statistics to suit your case.

On the first point, wage stagnation is hardly something unique to the UK.  Beloved Germany's average wages, for instance, [have been stagnant for the last decade](http://www.dw.de/wage-stagnation-the-other-side-of-germanys-economic-story/a-6346893), even decreasing whilst the rest of the industrialised world, including the UK, had an average wage increase of over 25%.  The lesson seems pretty clear: if you're an average worker, get the hell out of Germany, with its focus on manufacturing and concordant need to keep wages low, and move to the UK, as the recent historical record demonstrates that once the UK economy starts to recover the benefit will be passed on to the average worker in terms of wage increases.  Not so in Germany.

On the second point, average house prices have ballooned due to a number of reasons, hardly any of them to do with British banks.  The single largest cause is the complete fuck-up you're making in the Eurozone, which is seeing anybody and everybody with money to invest move it out of Italian, French and Spanish investments and park it in London property.

If the oil price rises in the future then it's another story.

For example, finding a few million mmbbl is completely economical for an onshore drill, costing maybe a few hundred thousand dollars to drill depending on the depth and type of rig.

Finding a few million mmbbl offshore and you wouldn't bother even extracting it due to the cost of renting an offshore rig. (runs into millions per day)

Most Church properties (30% of the whole country) were nationalized in the 1850' to curb the abuses (slavery and exploitation) as well foreign influence (the Romanian church was a part of the Greek orthodox church and thus under its rule). Then the communists in the 1950's nationalized what remained but the church buildings themselves were still used by the romanian church who colluded with the government and the secret police. Nowadays I think they're owned by the state and used by the church though many many more churches were built (thousands). Also the priests are payed by the state to the tune of 200M euros a year. 

The higher-ups in the church who are rich as hell and powerful as hell are now saying that it's normal for the government to pay because we nationalized in the 1850's. I say that they can go fuck themselves and feel lucky we don't take more in reparations for the shit they did throughout their history (notably slavery). 

All the old churches should be leased not given freely (kept as state property since they're historical buildings), all the new ones be put up for sale, and maybe can keep not taxing their business if we're feeling kind.

I would compete better? It's how capitalism is supposed to work — you adapt to the market. Someone does it better or cheaper than you? You step up your game and do it better than them, or find something else to do.

&gt; Globalisation is probably inevitable so slowly crank down the barriers or something not hundreds of thousands of people a year. This assumes labour is simply a commodity which it isn't it also has massive social consequences.

As noted in the article linked elsewhere in this thread titled ""British public wrong about almost everything"", immigration is nowhere near what the 'floodgate' rhetoric will have you believe. Far fewer people are competing with you due to immigration. A lot of people are competing with you due to the Internet.

From an economical point of view, to have a single market between 28 nations, without a unified political body to govern it, is infeasible. So this begs the question, why couldn't the rest of the EU nations upkeep the single market and UK could join it like the US is attempting at the moment, through a free trade deal between the two economical blocs?

The reason is, that why should the remaining EU negotiate such a deal with the UK? US is huge a country with industry, high-tech companies and rampaging innovation. The UK is what exactly, what are the bargaining chips that the UK could use, to force 27 nations to make a free trade deal with it?

The difficulty is going to rise, if you think of the resentment this kind of act would bring admidst the remaining 27 EU nations.",0,1375530286,null,0,false,0,cbg41ya,t3_1jkyjx,t1_cbg41ya,t1_cbg3tvb,null,1429960060,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

In my view, the FED economist denounces Germany's pressure on the ECB's behavior, which focusses on Germany and loses sight of the euro-zone as a whole. Germany forces the ECB to be cautious, as a lever for structural reform in the troubled regions of the EU.

52.

In sintesi: hai ragione nel precisare che c'è stato un processo di cambiamento che è cominciato prima ma io credo che tu lo renda troppo netto. Se non sbaglio (ammetto di non esser un esperto) Berlinguer è morto solo nell'84 e negli anni seguenti è successo di tutto a livello internazionale per condurre all'abbandono di una nave ormai non più troppo presentabile. Quando il nome fu cambiato in PDS all'interno c'erano diverse correnti, tra cui quelle ex-comuniste non confluite in PRC che non sposavano il socialismo di cui hai parlato sopra. Quindi, di fatto ex-comunisti non socialisti ce n'erano ancora nel partito, e tanti.

Poi tu sarai più preciso e più esperto dei dettagli ma ciò non toglie che per chi non votava PCI, il PDS era composto da ex-PCI.
