My point is simply that there is no need to freak out about it.

La Sagrada Familia is a must do, even if you are not particularly religious. The architecture is jaw dropping and the story behind it even more so. Book online in advance to avoid the ridiculously long queues and I recommend going earlier in the day - gives you more time to stay longer if you decide to do tours.

At any ice cream stall (and few stores) particularly around La Ramblas order some horchata (often spelt orxata in Catalan). It's a tasty refreshing drink popular (but not well known by tourists) by the locals. Made from a crushed root vegetable similar to potatoes, and tastes sort of like a sweet coconut milk - it is my absolute favourite when I'm in Barcelona. 

If you can catch the cable car from central city (by the ports) up to Montjuic. Again I would do this earlier in the day as exploring Montjuic can take a long time and the gorgeous views overlooking the city will have you paralysed.

Some states allow it, some states don't. Plus I honestly don't think a country's approach to gay marraige is the best metric for comparing whose country is better than that. I see reddit debates about the silliest things trying to prove that their country is better than someone elses.

These regions have always been fucked up work-wise (specially Galician people, whose expat-rate has historically been astoundingly high). So for most of these people, macro-economical variables doesn't mean much: they stick to what they have, they pick whatever jobs are available, etc... if you know what I mean. Let's say these regions don't have a bunch of middle-class kids saying ""I don't want to bend my back in the construction side because I deserve better, so I'll wait for the global economy to re-grow so I can find a nice job in an office with aircon and everything"" (I guess I'd be more like one of these, although I don't know 'cause half of my family is from these other regions and they are more like ""fuck it, gimme whatever job there is"").

Now I don't want to hear anything like ""these people are heros and the other ones are pussies"", because it's not like this at all. It is not a matter of will, it is simply a matter of circumstances.

* Marsh  
* Cork  
* Corcaigh  

So at the bottom Corcaigh would be the original Irish

Marsh at the top would be what that translates to in English. 

The middle 'Cork' is the anglicized form as when the British renamed Irish place names, they looked at a map and pronounced them as though the Irish used the Roman alphabet the same way they did. They would cut off bits to make it easier to read or throw away bits they couldn't think how to pronounce (mh or bh for example which sound like v or in this case 'aigh' which just sounds like 'ig'). 

Some counties on the bottom-right of the map are known in English by their anglicized Viking name. These are in gold. 

In those cases like Wicklow for example, the meaning of the original Viking name is at the top — meadow of the Vikings.

Then comes the anglicized Viking name by which it is commonly known in English — 'Wicklow' and that's followed by the original Viking name in brackets. 

Under that would be the original Irish name (still used when speaking Irish and  on road signs, all of which are in both languages) and its English meaning in brackets which in this case is the charming 'Church of the Toothless One'.",0,1358074327,null,0,1358079228,0,c7w35lv,t3_16hipj,t1_c7w35lv,t3_16hipj,null,1430945660,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15

the bigger clubs, like ""alando"" (the biggest) or ""5elements"" and a lot of smaller ones (kleine freiheit, unikeller, sonnendeck, grüner jäger, bottled, lagerhalle, balou and many more) most have a more or less specific theme (kleine freiheit for example is rather 90s and rock, sausalitos and others are rather south-american/spanish themed)

restaurants: yeah they exist, but i can't really say a lot about them since i just grab a döner when i'm hungry. ""the ranch"" is good (great steaks as far as i can say- never tried american steaks), there are some pizza places like ""vapiano"" and places for asian food, spanish food and everything else

for osnabrück itself: a lot of students around there, so 60% of the evenings there are people around bars every evening.
i don't know how interested you are in cultural stuff, but you can walk through the ""altstadt"" and look at all those old houses while shopping
also there is the ""felix nussbaum"" museum (a lot of people consider it worth a visit [never been there so i can't say anything particular about it])and the ""schlossgarten"" (well to be honest its some grass and some statues next to the ""schloss"", but the ""schloss"" is just a yellow building to me. also considered worth a visit

if you tell me the general area where you are going to stay i might be able to get some information on what is close to you and worth a visit

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Istanbul#.C4.B0stanbul

&gt; The modern Turkish name İstanbul (pronounced [isˈtanbuɫ]) is attested (in a range of variants) since the 10th century, at first in Armenian and Arabic and then in Turkish sources. It derives from the Greek phrase ""εις την Πόλιν"" or ""στην Πόλη"" [istimbolin], both meaning ""in the city"" or ""to the city""; a similar case is Stimboli, Crete. It is thus based on the common Greek usage of referring to Constantinople simply as The City (see above). The incorporation of parts of articles and other particles into Greek placenames was common even before the Ottoman period: Navarino for earlier Avarino, Satines for Athines, etc. Similar examples of modern Turkish placenames derived from Greek in this fashion are İzmit, earlier İznikmit, from Greek Nicomedia, İznik from Greek Nicaea ([iz nikea]), Samsun (s'Amison = ""se + Amisos""), and İstanköy for the Greek island Kos (from is tin Ko).

Quest'articolo fa cagare.

Capisco la necessità di rendere accessibile il pezzo alle masse, ma tra rendere accessibile e instupidire un argomento (che tra l'altro tira in mezzo anche le sfortune di un povero ""smanettone delle macchine"") ce ne passa.

La tentazione sarebbe di esporre questo articolo al pubblico ludibrio traducendolo in inglese e sbattendolo in /r/all, ma sai cos'è? 
E' che sembra proprio il frutto di un traduttore automatico, e non vorrei che facendo il percorso inverso si trasformi in un qualcosa di comprensibile al più come un monologo in na'vii.

Per concludere: se vuoi lurkare, lurka. Se non hai idea di cosa sia reddit o il concetto stesso di user-defined community, non tentare di spiegarlo con l'impegno che il mio cane mette nel masticare un nuovo giocattolo prima di tornare a leccarsi le palle.

Anyway, a company will hire when the employers wage is lower than the revenue + costs (and reinvestment). That difference would be profit. And this might sound confusing but a wage has barely anything to do with labour worth. For an employer it's simply, the lower the better. And €800 instead of €1000 just means €200 extra profit. There's no direct correlation between minimum wage and more jobs at all. Only when this is reinvested (implying there's a market for it) extra jobs could be created. 

So really, only in the situation where a higher minimum wage would mean the difference between profit and loss would this argument valid, but I'm guessing you'll need an obscenely high minimum wage to get to that level.

Much more important to explain this map are labour costs and worker productivity. Which would also explain abberations within countries with the same minimum wage like Wallonia and Nord pas de calais because these are regions that have a low productivity because of historical reasons (closing mines for example).

Generally, Bathrooms should have 21°C, all other rooms also 21°C, not occupied rooms are allowed to be 18°C. You are allowed to lower the temperature in all rooms by 2°C during night time to conserve energy.

This also means, that you are entitled to this temperature. Of course there are some physical limits (like when it is -50°C outside, you can't expect 30°C inside), but afaik a temperature difference of 25°C has to be possible. So if its -5°C outside, your room **has to have** the possibility to be maintained at +20°C.

So, please check out your rental agreement and if you are not certain about anything you could also check out the [Deutscher Mieterbund e.V.](http://www.mieterbund.de/), they defend all tennants and can give you tips on how to handle this situation.

For the short term relief, you could buy a heater fan (Heizlüfter) or an oil filled convector or Infrared emitting heater (Wärmewelle). You can buy these either on Amazon (cheapest) or in your local hardware store (Obi, Praktiker, Bauhaus, Toom.....)

Keep in mind that heating with electricity is much more expensive than by central heating. Central heating is usually also divided up for all tennants of the building, so if you have to turn up the heat more, the additional costs are shared with everyone (in part, see your rental agreement).

Ich lache immer, wenn in der anderen Hälfte meiner Herkunft die Liberalen und die Konservativen öffentlich zeigen, dass Politik und Schlagwortgefechte Synonyme sind und denke mir: ""Zum Glück lebe ich hier!"" Dann schallt es von links *Nazi!* von rechts *Antisemit!* und dann von links *""Mein Spruch!""* und ich denke wieder: ""Arschlöcher.""

**WERBUNG:** *Beschneidungsdebatte? Ja? Antisemit sein ohne Israelkritik in 10 Schritten!*

Es geht um Schwänze. Wer hat den längeren? Bescheißen die Juden, weil er ohne Hütchen größer wirkt? Nein, sagen Experten, gemessen wird nicht mit deutschen Journalisten, sondern mit Islamgeborenen, und die haben, wie allgemein bekannt, ja auch kein Hütchen. Inzwischen sogar ohne rechtliche Grauzone. Sieht ja auch doof aus.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Anyway, a company will hire when the employers wage is lower than the revenue + costs (and reinvestment). That difference would be profit.

Of course.

&gt;a wage has barely anything to do with labour worth. 

Yes it has, a wage and the benefits are the compensation for the labour.

If a company doesn't want to pay what the employee is worth it, then the employee won't work there as the employee won't benefit from it; just like a customer won't get a car below market price just because he's not willing to come to an agreement with the car dealer.

&gt;For an employer it's simply, the lower the better.

Obviously, but for the employee, the higher the better. It's all about demand and supply of labour, the costs of one side being the benefits of the other.

&gt;And €800 instead of €1000 just means €200 extra profit.

And 1000€ instead of 800€ just means 200€ extra for the employee. Regardless of how the negotiation goes, if there's an agreement then it's because both the employer or the employee benefit.

&gt;There's no direct correlation between minimum wage and more jobs at all.

There is because once you increase the minimum wage past the threshold of the market price, it becomes unprofitable. For example, in that example, there might be a business across the border that pays 900€ and makes the same product, if we were to set the minimum wage at 1000€ then the other product would be 100€ cheaper.

This would be silly because on the long run all the jobs would be lost here and the people just across the border would then be getting all of the money.

Furthermore, between a guy straight out of college and a guy in his 30s, a company might be willing to employ both, one for 800€ or the other for 1000€, with the minimum wage the only choice is to hire the 30 year old guy for 1000€, thereby increasing the youth unemployment.

&gt;Only when this is reinvested (implying there's a market for it) extra jobs could be created. 

It's not only like this, even if the 200€ go to the worker as opposed to the employer, that worker can also use those 200€ to start a business of his own.

&gt;So really, only in the situation where a higher minimum wage would mean the difference between profit and loss would this argument valid, but I'm guessing you'll need an obscenely high minimum wage to get to that level.

You're right, unless the minimum wage is above the market value of the labour it has any effect, and for pretty much everybody, the minimum wage is too low.

Though it is true that there are people (such as myself) whose qualifications aren't worth paying a full minimum wage and so, in my case, I'm either stuck doing unremunerated internships or not working at all as the government won't allow people like me being employed for less than 470€*14 months.

This is very silly, that's why I support the Austrian, German, Danish, Swedish or Finnish system, because it allows for people such as myself to come to an agreement and get a lower minimum wage while people who have worked for years and are much more experienced to get a much higher one, as long as it doesn't interfere with the market value, it won't create unemployment, and the Portuguese system of an arbitrary value that's the same for everybody does just that.

&gt;Much more important to explain this map are labour costs and worker productivity. Which would also explain abberations within countries with the same minimum wage like Wallonia and Nord pas de calais because these are regions that have a low productivity because of historical reasons (closing mines for example).

You're absolutely right, to assume that unemployment is only caused by the minimum wage is ludicrous, though I never said that. It can be a serious factor or it can be negligible/non-existent, the point I was making is that the minimum wage does promote unemployment that targets much more strongly the youth.

But no, you're right, it's not the most important factor, other labour laws, the tax system, the demographic composition or the natural resources, to name some examples, these can promote much more unemployment that the minimum wage ever does.

&gt;On an international scale we have Germany that has reinvested in its economy for decades, compared to Greece whose capitalist class has invested its money abroad and in luxury yachts which made Greece pretty much determined to export feta cheese and olives.

I'll say that you're partially right as there's some truth there but you can't just say the investments in Greece were for the most part unwise because of the ""capitalist class"", that's silly, they would invest in Greece just like the Germans invested in Germany if the Greek government had provided the same conditions and incentives for productive investment in their country.

E il suo social network, Reddit, è più una piazza virtuale - o almeno lo è stato fino all'acquisizione di Wired coi dollaroni della Condé Nast - che quella vetrina anche delle vanità diventata Facebook.

Questa frase lascia trasparire un certo disprezzo verso Aaron perche' e' stato il ""solito sfigato"" che ha dato veramente peso alla sostanza (una piazza virtuale in cui poter parlare di qualunque argomento e non censurata stile Cina - vedi vari casi di rimozioni di articoli su fb) rispetto all'apparenza (la vetrina di fb).

Secondo me, questo e' uno dei problemi chiave del nostro povero Paese: conta piu' quello che sembri che quello che sei veramente. Ed uno dei problemi per cui la tecnologia, quella VERA (non fare i fighi con l'iPhone 5 per esempio), avra' sempre difficolta' ad affermarsi.

Cars in Germany have to get inspected every 2 years, this inspection is called *Hauptuntersuchung* and costs around 80 Euros. The inspection is done by one of the following organisations: TÜV, DEKRA. In colloquial language Germans refer to this as ""the TÜV"" as in ""how long does this car have TÜV?"". Your garage usually can also arrange the inspection for you. I usually give my local DEKRA a call for an appointment, and have it done in about 30 minutes.

The ""Grüne Plakette"" is the green (yellow, red) sticker you will see at a lot of cars in Germany: ([examples](http://www.tz-online.de/bilder/2009/03/10/99788/1307214861-umweltplaketteumweltzonewapperl-1C09.jpg)) Certain cities ban older vehicles from their limits, so you will need the right *Umweltplakette* to enter. Example: The city of Munich does ban all vehicles with a red sticker (or no sticker). Don't worry: Most cars built in the last years get a green *Umweltplakette*, with the exception of a few diesel vehicles which get a yellow one.

You can get the *Umweltplakette* at various places (e.g. TÜV, DEKRA, your local vehicle registration office, your garage) just by showing the ""Fahrzeugschein"" (which specifies the type of vehicle) and paying about 5 Euros.

It was an organised attack, meant to ruin a person's life and deter anyone who wants to fight for information freedom, coordinated by well off, educated people who made conscious choices, had access to all the facts, were reminded repeatedly by the media how ridiculous and immoral their actions were and did it all for the political and financial benefit of special interests and the serfdom of everyone else.

&gt;These people were informed, they had to know how malevolent they were acting towards Aaron and those who try to maintain freedom and democracy in the digital world. They were aware and still chose to try to ruin his life even though he was clearly acting entirely in the interest of others and doing it in a manner that was civil and non violent. They did it just because he was smarter than most and thus a greater threat to entrenched powers. The level of evil here is truly off the scale. The fact that it resulted in his death is just...

In former Yugoslavia, and the ex-USSR, similar polls generally show an even more favorable view. Baltics and Czechia mostly less, which is probably understandable.

Secondly, the divide between the East and the West of Europa was already visible in the 19th century and became less pronounced with the rise of the Soviet Union. It's a fact that at least the USSR and Yugoslavia made greater economic progress than the rest of Western Europe. States like Bulgaria and Rumania I don't really know about.

Then, during the late 70s, 80s the system started to slow down, didn't manage to innovate and then the collapse and unbridled free market pretty much did more economic damage than two million German soldiers invading the place 50 years ago. This in my opinion explains the divide better than a simple free market/central planning hypothesis.

Whether the state provides the water or private companies provide the water. You're still paying. One is upfront and the other is through taxes. Seeing as I'm paying I might as well *choose* which water I want to buy rather than being stuck with what the government gives me.

Personally I'd like nationalised water in my country (UK) with private industry on the side incase they think they can stand up to the nationalised behemoth (If they're innovative they can). However I don't think it should be imposed upon people. If people such as the homeless or disadvantaged can't afford water *then* the government can step in to give them it, along with food and perhaps clothing. However, some one has to pay for that and that will be non disadvantaged tax payers.

Non disadvantaged tax payers shouldn't be forced to pay for **their own** water **if they don't want to** and **they make up a majority in the country**.

They should be taxes to pay for the water of those who can't afford their own but I'm not uncertain this isn't already the case or that this petition limits itself to that remit. I think what this petition is saying is that all water industries across the EU should be nationalised in the same way the health service is nationalised in the UK. I disagree with that as a **blanket** principle. Yes, I think the UK water industry should be nationalised. But we shouldn't *force other people to nationalise their own industries*.

That's nonsense.

&gt;While the Germans did much, much more effort in building off socialism in East Germany than they ever did in denazifying Germany.

Oh, come on, don't pull the ""GFR is a continuation of Nazi Germany"", that's retarded.

&gt;In former Yugoslavia, and the ex-USSR, similar polls generally show an even more favorable view.

All those countries are free to try the same moronic socialist policies again.

&gt;Secondly, the divide between the East and the West of Europa was already visible in the 19th century and became less pronounced with the rise of the Soviet Union.

If you ignore all the famines and the repression and the collectivisations, yeah, things weren't that different. Though you're ignoring the elephant in the room.

&gt;It's a fact that at least the USSR and Yugoslavia made greater economic progress than the rest of Western Europe.

It's also a fact that mostly everybody lived in awful conditions while the nomenklatura and those friendly to the regime lived with even more extravagance than the system they set out to destroy. At least the monarchs and the aristocrats of the ancient regimes weren't hypocrites.

&gt;States like Bulgaria and Rumania I don't really know about.

Read up on Romania and Ceausesco. I dunno what you'll make of it, you might even like it, though I personally find it extremely distasteful.

Yes, demonstrating the flaw of central planning. I mean, it collapsed on its own, right?

&gt;unbridled free market pretty much did more economic damage than two million German soldiers invading the place 50 years ago.

What? So the success of the West was the downfall of the East? I really don't get you, Zombie Lenin.

&gt;This in my opinion explains the divide better than a simple free market/central planning hypothesis. Namely, more than 20 years of the worst of central planning combined with the worst of the free market. 

The worst of a free market? Switzerland seems amazing all around.

Poor little Netherlands votes fully against nationalisation, but because France with its 60 million votes likes it, they get ti inflict nationalisation on the water industry.

You should also see, that an apprenticeship is originally not designed for people with A-levels, so the curriculum is slower than you might need it, but others might not be that bright. 

Regarding payment: While it may be quite low, you might know the saying ""Lehrjahre sind keine Herrenjahre."" (""You have to start at the bottom of the ladder"" as a very very rough translation). Apprentices in metal and electrics for example get 849€ in the first year, 897€ in the second and 955€ in the third year in bavaria. While this is not that much, you can easily live off it. I had much less money during my time at university and I did quite well. Of course there are other crafts where apprenticeses get less. On the other side, the expectations among young people are quite high in germany. Why do many young need the new iPhone 5 as soon as it arrives, or a huge flatscreen, 2-3 weeks of summer vacation (Spain is the least, better Asia or Dominican Republic) and a week of skiing in the alps and partying hard every weekend while doing the apprenticeship? 

When I lived and worked in spain and talked about the differences of these systems with coworkers, they were quite frustrated about the spanish system.
I believe the german system is good after all, although there might be room for improvements of course.

Yes they are. And they wont be convinced by someone who condemns the experiences of people who actually lived there as moronic.

&gt;If you ignore all the famines and the repression and the collectivisations, yeah, things weren't that different. Though you're ignoring the elephant in the room.

The elephant is imaginary. Economic progress under socialism dwarfs anything the old order came up with, famines and repression occured there too, but at least under socialism the famines that may have been the result of collectivisation (or at least made existing famines worse) lead to a massive increase in food production.

&gt;It's also a fact that mostly everybody lived in awful conditions while the nomenklatura and those friendly to the regime lived with even more extravagance than the system they set out to destroy. At least the monarchs and the aristocrats of the ancient regimes weren't hypocrites.

That's untrue. Living conditions rose for the general population and the extravagance of the nomenklatura is a myth. Except for megalomaniacs like ceausescu.

&gt;Public ownership of essential services like the water supply, energy supplies, healthcare, telecoms etc. ensures that they're operated for the public good

They are indeed operated for the public good and not for private share holders, however a conservative or libertarian would argue that it forgets the main point of a capitalist system. That point being that when multiple people/companies try to achieve the same goal for their own benefit, it means the standards become better for every one. This dynamic is vacant in a socialist, state owned system. On some fronts it's worth having a state owned industry any way (such as health) and some times it is (ever heard of a good car that's come from the USSR?).

Different people and different countries will have different opinions on where that line should be drawn. I think the line should go further left in the UK, (to encompass water and rail like it used to but not steel for instance). But people who live in different places, as well as literally living in a different economic and literal climate than me will have different opinions on where that line should be drawn. Perhaps they believe the line should include the steel industry or perhaps they believe that line should go further right and exclude the water and rail industries. That choice is, and should be, theirs. 

I have this belief that the truth always comes to the top. If having state owned water industry is ** truly** the best option I believe we'll all **eventually** ^(I didn't say it would come to the top quickly) make that decision.

Economic progress under socialism was negative, there was a massive loss in life quality. And the old order is dead and long gone, they aren't coming back, not in the form of monarchies they're not, no, now tyrants come disguised as man of the people, you know, like every communist government there has ever been.

&gt;at least under socialism the famines that may have been the result of collectivisation (or at least made existing famines worse) lead to a massive increase in food production.

With the exception of WW2, free market systems didn't have famines. Oh, and starving people to overproduce food is beyond retarded. Also, look up the definition of ""opportunity cost"".

&gt;That's untrue. Living conditions rose for the general population and the extravagance of the nomenklatura is a myth. Except for megalomaniacs like ceausescu.

And the Soviets. And the Chinese. And the North Koreans. And the Cubans. Face it, these people became the very thing they set out to destroy once they seized power, the only thing achieved was often a bloodbath, an even more repressive system and a decrease of the average life quality.

&gt;I don't see why my defense for aspects of old socialism make me agree with a dictator who inspired his policy on North Korea leaderworship

The problem with old socialism is that it leads to the new socialism. Your ideology sure is appealing as they describe it but it always fails because we're greedy humans and power corrupts and people only want what's better for themselves, nobody actually cares more about the poor and the needy in a socialist system than they do in a free market one. It's like religion, just because you might believe in it with all your strength, that doesn't make it true, we're still going to be whom we are.

&gt;No. It's precarious condition made it possible to be overthrowed.

No, it was precarious because it was poorly designed and dysfunctional, it was overthrown because it was socialist, not despite being socialist.

&gt;I don't deny capitalist success stories. I don't deny capitalist failures either, like Bangladesh, Eastern Europe, Venezuela, etc...

I don't know about Bangladesh, Eastern Europe is THE failure of communist, not capitalism, and Venezuela has plenty of oil and is also destroyed by Chávez socialism.

&gt;No, but I do realize that corporatism is pretty much inevitable in a capitalist society.

Not if you keep a balance of powers. It's the same for everything, in a weakened democracy it can be both the corporations or the workers and the unions seizing power and the consequences being wholly negative for everyone.

However there are examples like Switzerland where power has always been balanced, democracy preserved and the free entry of the market cherished and they're a great example, they just live there in the mountains and have a great life quality, they have never faced that which you mention about corporatism and protectionism, exploitation and censorship.

A few things:

- the south has great weather, but can be bitterly expensive.  

- job wise, I know there are English language schools in Nice, which is a big city, but not too big. 

- A smaller places like Montpellier and Aix-en-Provence have large student communities.  There are likely to be opportunities there.  

- Do a bit of research on AngloInfo France (Google AngloInfo France). You can select a region.  You'll find quite a bit of info, plus forums.  

- A personal favourite is Lyon.  Very friendly people.  Large student population.  Well connected.  

- generally speaking, the consensus is that the people in the south are friendlier.  And depending where you are, also more likely to speak English if you make an effort to speak French.  

- Personally, I would opt for somewhere in the south.  Look at Bordeaux, Montpellier, Avignon, Aix, Nice.  

- Marseille is unlike any other city in France.  It has a very diverse community and feel to it.  It has a bad reputation, but that reputation is somewhat outdated.  It is dirty and smelly in places.  It is well connected, but even with that, it's probably not the best place to begin.  And it has the Mistral (wind), which can drag in for a bit.  

- I have found Nice very friendly if you gave basic French.  Nice is well connected (second busiest airport in France).  There are trains to Paris and to Ventimille in Italy.  The trains are frequently late.  From Nice you can explore the south easily.  

- Teaching English won't earn you much, so you do have to watch your living costs, especially if you are in a place like Nice.  Bus travel in Nice (that department i.e. 06) is very cheap.  Rents are very high. 

- if you look at AngloInfo you can get an idea of rents.  Also, sometimes people look for roommates on airbnb.com. 

I would avoid cities like Caen, Rennes, Rouen, Orleans, Le Mans and Reims.  They all have very characteristic features and are worth visiting, but try finding info on the south first.  Then work your way up to Lyon, Tours, Nantes and Nancy.

In 1995 the drought was the other way round - plenty of water in East Yorkshire and none in West Yorkshire. I along with pretty much every available truck driver within 100 miles hauled hundreds of tanker fulls of water from the water treatment plants in East Yorkshire over to the reservoirs in West Yorkshire which supplied a population of about 2 million people. You couldn't find any tanker trailers to hire within 100 miles so many were being used and the govt suspended all drivers hours restrictions whilst the emergency continued. 

After that, Yorkshire Water had the foresight to decide that a massive underground distribution network was needed to prevent it happening again and during the drought in the east of the UK in 2010-11, we in East Yorkshire got the benefits. Whilst Lincolnshire on the south bank of the river Humber served by a different water company had hosepipe bans, in East Yorkshire we had no restrictions at all as water was just pumped from North and West Yorkshire over to us.

Yorkshire Water is using its unique £300 million underground grid to move drinking water from North and Central Yorkshire to mitigate lower than normal groundwater levels in East Yorkshire.
Whilst water resources in the region remain healthy at 97% - with the company able to source water from rivers and groundwater as well as its extensive reservoir network – the company is concerned that not all sources are as high as they would expect.

Groundwater supplies in East Yorkshire in particular,, which are part of the supply to meet drinking water demand in many parts of Hull and the surrounding areas, are currently standing at 20% lower than the company would normally expect around this time of year.

In order to give depleted groundwater supplies in East Yorkshire a chance to replenish, the company is sourcing more water for Hull and surrounding areas from other sources, using its £300 million grid of underground pipes to move water from the north and centre of the region, where it is more plentiful.

On the first situation then the government needs to step in and establish a maximum price (but one that doesn't lead to the company closing down) and in the second situation then it was unfortunate but it's an extra expense that if it wasn't supported by the increase of the price, it would be supported by the taxes, in the end you'd be paying more regardless of who owned the water company so it's indifferent.",0,1358111579,null,0,false,0,c7waz39,t3_16hwhr,t1_c7waz39,t1_c7w9cdr,null,1430949431,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You and your employer pay ~15% of your income to the insurance and they pay for A LOT! Virtually any treatment is payed by them. Except many teeth treatments, they make you pay ~30% by yourself AFAIK. 

The patient has to pay also soemthign like 5 Euro for every medicine prescription.

Children and unemployed husband/wife are insured for free within your insurance.

That's the compulsory health insurance, if you earn more than ~55k Euro a year or are a (state) clerk then you have another option. You can opt out of the compulsory health insurance and make a private health insurance, as someone who knows both versions I can tell you that there is only very little difference, the only major difference is when it comes to waiting to get to a specialist, the privates get to see him/her much quicker. 

On the downside a private health insurance customer has to pay EVERTHING by himself and has to settle teh cost with his insurance, but they also pay nearly 100%.

Children and unemployed husband/wife must be insured additionally.

A private health insurance can get very expensive, but most of them are MUCH cheaper as the compulsory health insurance at the beginning and get real expensive as you get older.

There are some more options also, for students etc., but I don't know them very good...

tl;dr:

The german health insurance system is really complicated, but in every case you will get a very good treatment.

* The law is called ""Mariage pour tous"" and is falsely named as it still not recognize cultural and religious polygamy. We eithr open mariage for everyone or just to *just* one of many minorities. The name is hypocritical by itslef, as are those who dared present the bill.

* The project is used as a diversion to hide other bills and reforms from the headlines (mostly the european budgetary pact). Just check the media's headline prior to the annoucement of this one bill.

* I have many gay friends and conducted personal polls that show less than 15% of gay people giving a shit about mariage. Most just don't even want it or any of the related measures. More significantly, moste told me that they consider to have been used in a debate that only concern an active minority of the gay community.

* With the opening of mariage for homosexuals comes two issues : loss of identity for parents (father and mother beeing replaced by parent 1 and parent2 in official documentation), and worse, adoption.

* Adoption in France is a real issue. The loss of right to anonymously abandon a child at birth emptied the only legal adoption branch. There only remain monetized adoption scams and trafics from abroad. Opening adoption to new couples with no childs to adopt in a legal and free way will raise pressure on a limited *market* therefore helping human trafickers all around the globe.

* Last, mariage is a symbol, and legal rights have been bound to this symbol, mostly inherited from cultual references. The *PACS* , first civil contract to legalize the union of two people of the same gender in France, could basically have the same role as mariage without the need to alter a cultual symbol.

My personnal opinion is that this bill is only set as a diversion and to raise tensions between communities (gay v.s. religious). The so-called ""equality in rights"" could have been achieved by a milder bill expanding the PACS instead of altering the ""old fashioned civil union"". In such case there would have been no debate and everything would have gone just fine for everyone (but some fanatics).

This bill is bad bill, wether its goal is sound or not. I firmly oppose it and ask for it to be rewriten as a real enhancement for civil rights, and not as a civil tensions timebomb as it has been designed.

Compare modern Belarussian nemavlya, Polish niemowlę and Ukrainian nemovlya (meaning baby) - they all simply mean ""a little person who mumbles/lacks speech""; and modern Czech němota and Polish/Russian niemota - muteness.

An early Slav could've very well simply called the people whom he understood Slavs (""people who speak my words""), and everyone else - people whom he couldn't understand - Němьcь (""people who don't speak my words"").

Just do the same with your heterosexual friends. The figure is going to be as low.

&gt;With the opening of mariage for homosexuals comes two issues : loss of identity for parents (father and mother beeing replaced by parent 1 and parent2 in official documentation

What does that change ? They still will be ""father"" or ""mother"" in real life. You just can't have a paperwork with mother and father, like what : ""mother or father 1"" and ""mother and father 2"" to differentiate them ? 

&gt;Last, mariage is a symbol, and legal rights have been bound to this symbol, mostly inherited from cultual references. The PACS , first civil contract to legalize the union of two people of the same gender in France, could basically have the same role as mariage without the need to alter a cultual symbol.

Yeah, basically, outside of adoption/PMA of course, this is what is at stake. People do not want a ""separate but equal"" system. Yes it's a symbol, and people want it to change.

&gt;and worse, adoption.

Why ? Not only there are already lots of gay couples with children (but legally, nly one of the couple is the parent), and experiences from abroad who legalized adoption for gay couples do not show any harm for the children.

&gt;The project is used as a diversion to hide other bills and reforms from the headlines (mostly the european budgetary pact). Just check the media's headline prior to the annoucement of this one bill.

Both sides are to blame here. The Left has hidden itself behind it, and the Right just fell into to it.

However dog tax vastly differs between cities. In Hamburg for example it's 90€/year/dog while in Hannover it's 120€ for your first dog and 240€ for every dog after that.

If you get a Listenhund (breeds considered dangerous) the dog tax is 600€/year/dog in both Hamburg and Hannover. 

Then there is dog food (and as a responsible owner you will avoid any of the cheap ones with wheat and sugar in them) and the important vaccinations for your dog also you should probably calculate at least one visit to the vet each year because your dog ate some toxic shit or has an infection or something like that.

So as I said, financially you should ask yourself if you can spend 1000€/year if nothing goes horribly wrong. 


Whether dogs are allowed in your apartment depends on the contract and what the landlord says. Generally speaking they can prohibit you from having any pet that's bigger/more annoying than a cat.

Dall'ingresso in Umbria in poi, immagini dalla penombra caotica del bus, strade completamente deserte coperte da sporco nevischio tardivo, vento gelido, le stanze malconce di un tre stelle fuori stagione intrise dall'odore di Nike sudate, deodorante economico e ganja di bassa qualità, si fondono confusamente in un limbo mentale, come gli ascensori di Gubbio che non ricordo da dove partissero o dove arrivassero, apice indiscusso del mio spleen adolescenziale.   
Dalle cuffie del Discman uscivano Berlin di Lou Reed, The Doctor Came at Dawn di Smog, e Da Qui dei Massimo Volume, dischi dell'oblio profondo che ho tuttora il terrore di riascoltare. Nell'autobus qualcuno mandava in loop i terribili Articolo 31.

true,Perky_Goth,PORT,Portugal,"&gt;No, austerity is not that, austerity is cutting excessive public spending, look it up. 

Look it up? Language changes, and that is not the definition that is applied in practice, so I won't use it.

&gt; they're being used by the government wastefully, let me keep my money and I'll take great care of it, certainly much better than the guys in the AR.

Everyone uses it wastefully, mate. The market does not make things efficient by magic, only when there's strong competition and rights leveling for the case of weak parties.

And no, you can't always use it better because you're a much weaker party in negotiations and don't deal in volume. When Americans have a serious disease, there's not even negotiation, they pay or they die. It's not even always clear what's happening until after the fact, like the ridiculous amount of money a degree costs, but for many careers, there's no choice either.

Some things can be fixed with laws, others by the state being the primary provider. But if you're going to go the law route, it has to have teeth, it has to be able to close companies and it has to be able to put people in jail.
&gt; Hollywood and all of that is achieved without any public investment, let people keep their money as that's what's necessary

Hollywood also achieves DRM and ridiculous copyright terms, while mostly recycling old shit every year. Color me unimpressed. 

There are things that private companies are just not interested in doing because they are not profitable, but that have an unknowable value for the future. I'm not a cultural man, so it's hard for me to say what, but I can point out that without the state interfering there would not be the Internet or the many innovations that came from NASA.

I think PBS and BBC do a great job that isn't necessarily profitable, and certainly RTP *had* the fairest reporting in the media. Of course, IMHO.

&gt;anyone could be a manager or a business owner if the state didn't have to make things so difficult with all the bureaucracy and taxes and regulation and laws and waiting periods

Anyone can be a manager in an hour, and there's no lack of small business here. What happens is lack of oversight over the public offices and most of the money ends up being funneled to things we don't need or are too expensive, but is both a big and small government problem. Banks certainly don't help.

&gt;the fees you must pay to fire someone are massive and it's no wonder our unemployment is so high now given that there's such a restriction to employment.

If they don't work you **can** fire them for free. I fail to see how being able to fire people who do good work for whatever you want is an issue.

&gt; people that do end up unemployed will also have a much easier time creating their own employment as opposed to sitting around waiting for someone to employ them.

Oh, yes, with the huge salaries managers like to pay, I'm sure all they lack is a push. And we all know everyone is cut out to be a business owner, why should we even have employees in this country, especially ones who can have a comfortable life? That's terrible!

There's tons of startups, connected to universities or not, and most of the business in Portugal are very small, so I don't get what problem you're trying to correct.

&gt;In the US or the UK people can fire you almost on the spot

That is state dependent, some are not like that at all. That creates terrible work conditions, anyway. I've heard they offer other ways for people to get on their feet that we don't, but I admit I haven't researched it. However...

&gt; as long as they work well as if that's the case, it's already in the best interest of the business that that worker is well taken care off 

Right, like outsourcing to India isn't a huge thing in your role models, which is quickly increasing their unemployment rates. And it's common to fire people who want a vacation, or people who want to go to a funeral. It's not even unheard of to fire sick or pregnant people here, let alone in the US, regardless of how well they worked before. There's very little incentive to keep someone who isn't going to be productive for a while if you have to keep pulling your numbers up to have you yearly bonus, especially since you'll be long gone using your ""skills"" elsewhere when the shit hits the fan. That's a common CEO path.

&gt;If you're productive, you have nothing to fear, you'll only benefit from this.  If you're not productive, then I'd worry because you can get fired and that's how it should be

That's not how people work, period. And people have sickness, depression family problems and all kinds of issues all the time that are only going to be amplified by further stress.

&gt;what about the employer which might have to close the plant in 6 months time because there's 5 workers not doing their job properly and he can't fire them and now there's more people slacking off

If they couldn't before, they can certainly be easily fired for a few years now, so I don't get what you're complaining about.

2013 is also a good year to move there because we're the [European capital of culture](http://www.mp2013.fr/?lang=en).

Marseille is also a cheap city to live in. Rent is notably cheaper than about anywhere else in Southeastern France. Marseille being a relatively poor city, food and other commodities are relatively cheap as well if you know where to go.


That being said, we have a bad reputation regarding security. While YMMV, I lived there my entire life until I moved to the US this year and never had any real problem, you just have to have some common sense.

&gt;Besides, comparing gay marriage and polygamy or incest is useless and insulting.

Depends what you mean with polygamy and incest. If you take polygamy as one man, several submissive women, and incest as one adult abusing under aged family members, yes it is.

If you take polygamy as a marriage between several individuals, with *consentement éclairé* then what's the problem ? How is it wrong ? It's like polyamory, with legal benefits. Just the same as incest. You can legally marry your cousin. You can have a love affair/sex with any member of your family legally, provided both are adults and willing to.

Although these cases are taken as slippery-rope argument by opponents to gay marriage (if gay marriage then POLYGAMY ! Then the end of the world ! beware !!oneone!!), it raises a valid question. Where do you draw the line ?

Marriage is not based on biology. We say love and mutual consent is enough for two persons of the same gender to marry. Then why not three, or four, or ten, or 2n+1 ? Culture and tradition ? Well, let's keep straight-only marriage then. Same with incest.

Legalizing gay marriage is moving an arbitrary line to another arbitrary line, and it's quite difficult to back up something arbitrary while not backing something as arbitrary.

true,Perky_Goth,PORT,Portugal,"&gt;People with extremely debilitating diseases shouldn't be a burden on companies, at most they should be at the care of social security or the NHS.
&gt;As for the unemployable, that's a problem for the education system and social care

Since you're for massively lowering taxes, where does the money come from? If they have to pay taxes, they're going to pay for it one way or the other. But I mostly agree that the state should be the ones to educate them and so on, the problem is that then people from your side are still going to call them bums and cut the programs.

&gt;The mandatory overtime with little pay would end the moment unemployment went down

Happened nowhere, ever. That would be a prime reason for unemployment not to go down, BTW.

&gt;as companies would lose much of their bargaining position

Which hasn't happened anywhere either without social protection or on a market with very few qualified people.

&gt;pensions should be managed much better as the current system isn't sustainable for not even 10 years 

I hope you're not talking about private funds, otherwise I'll point to you how it works in practice in the US: their money gets taken out because businesses need the money elsewhere.

But I think the issue is solved here with the increase in retirement age, huge decreases in health care quality and much higher costs.

&gt;and public transportation should be privatised as we already spend loads of money on it and the private sector provides the same service much more efficiently, not to mention we already spent massive amount of money on the roads.

Sure they can. Just cut whatever offers there are to the profitable ones. You'll get Intercity trains from Porto to Lisbon, most of the metropolitan routes in Porto and Lisbon, but with much less availability, and there you go. So much for mobility and only two cities will grow, but it's profitable. 

I'm extremely unconvinced that transportation should be profitable by itself, there's too much people left out. And privatization usually ends very badly, like the train privatization in the UK.

Yeah, we built some stupid highways that barely look like highways, but that's how big business works.

But...

&gt;No, it's nothing like that, if anything these measures would turn us more into the UK or Switzerland.

We may not be talking about the same measures, I don't know. But in the UK and the US, they also say they're too privileged, so I maintain the the end goal **for them**, not you, is to turn us into China.

&gt;The moment the state leaves that business and the companies are left on their own and without taxpayer funding having to compete with the rest of us mortals by the same rules.

No politician ever wanted that, so never? It doesn't work, anyway. Pharmaceuticals need huge investments from the state. There's no market incentive to stop global warming. In fact, there's not even a market incentive for people not to go hungry, so Monsanto happens.

&gt;I don't know, though we must also not follow Greece into that path of defaulting, Socrates made the deals, now Coelho is paying for it and he can't force Socrates to cough up the money.

He's gone far beyond the deal and plans to go much further. This **is** a default by another name, the contract is impossible to fulfill. No country has ever tried to pay it like this without a war, and there's a reason for that. 

&gt;Because our public schools not always can provide the same service. I did my high school on a private one and it was the state that paid for it because my area of study wasn't available in the eb2/3 I was in, and I should tell you, it was a school much better managed than all the public ones I was in.

I can believe that. But go watch the TVI report on the GPS group about how it's working these days. Public schools are empty because the students are being sent to the private school next door that rejects the students they don't want. Honestly, the fact that they don't do much better then public schools is pretty damning.

&gt; you have to control the beneficiaries and you must be able to pay for it without creating a great burden on the rest of society 

That's great, as long as we agree that it's better that some slip through so that others can be helped. There's a ton of paperwork needed these days that is easy to misfile.

&gt; let's look at the cases of success such as the UK, Switzerland, Finland or Austria

Sadly, I can't comment. Aren't they in recession too?

&gt; not where the businesses we do have are forced to leave or move some place else

They leave because they don't pay taxes elsewhere. Paychecks are so minimal that I seriously doubt how a couple of unfirable bad workers, by your view, would even hit the bottom line of major companies.

&gt; let's not go down the same path of the cases of failure such as Greece, **Venezuela, Argentina**

Simplifying much? AFAIK, they're growing pretty well after throwing off foreign intervention, even if Venezuela's inflation is mental. 


&gt;&gt;the economy grew in a much more stable way when social rights appeared.

&gt;False, our economy grew when we joined the EU and the restrictions to competition from the Estado Novo were lifted

Yeah, we're an anomaly, I meant after the Industrial Revolution, the Soviet Revolution and during the cold war. Unsurprisingly, they happened due to fear, because power never cares about the lower classes otherwise.

&gt;Take your socialist rhetoric elsewhere, there's no 1% taking all the profits, in Portugal what you do have is an environment that kills the competitiveness of any business and inept governments and corrupt politicians that either offer special favours to interest groups

Right, the Banks, Brisa, Martins dos Santos and so on have all bled profusely since 2008 and haven't improved in profits every year. 

And it's not like the Troika business is just a way of funneling German taxpayers money into their own banks so they don't get responsibility for the risky deals they made. Oh, that's right, they deal with trillions but had no idea that they were being fooled by Greece and just gambled, sorry, invested unwisely. 

Believe what you want, I've given up hope anything will change until catastrophe strikes in a few months, anyway.

It is about propagating 7th century ideals, where women are subject to the tools of masculine domination (unequal rights, the burka, arranged marriage), homosexuals worthy of death and so on. And rare is the muslim who does not eat halal.

Both sides have good points but you have to chose one side (or a realistic alternative of which this is not) or your not really contributing. People who say Charles should abdicate give me the sense of people who are against the monarchy but don't want to give up the cultural value of it...which is fine as long as your honest about that.

Insurers are obliged to insure all persons regardless of age, state of health unconditionally and without waiting periods.

The set of treatments covered is mandatory for each basic policy. In addition to that one can get additional insurance to cover private rooms in hospitals, some dental expenses, etc.

Everyone has to pay the premiums which are calculated from a set of factors (e.g. amount of franchise, age, gender, insurance model). I would say that one is expected to pay few hundreds CHF per month. Low-income households can get lowered franchise depending on the canton. 

How does it work? Either one is billed and has to pay, and then claim the money from the insurance (90% or 100% in function of retention).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Economic progress under socialism was negative, there was a massive loss in life quality. And the old order is dead and long gone, they aren't coming back, not in the form of monarchies they're not, no, now tyrants come disguised as man of the people, you know, like every communist government there has ever been.

As in all liberating ideologies there are people who aim for personal gain. To see communism as a ploy though is silly. And no, economic progress under socialism wasn't negative. The greatest catch up movements were done by socialist regimes wether you like it or not. 

&gt;And the Soviets. And the Chinese. And the North Koreans. And the Cubans. Face it, these people became the very thing they set out to destroy once they seized power, the only thing achieved was often a bloodbath, an even more repressive system and a decrease of the average life quality.

What they want to destroy was the oppressive economic relationships and poverty resulting from it, which they did. Life expectancy increased tremendously in China, just like it plumetted in Russia in the 90s. Before socialism, the future soviet states, China and Cuba were ruled by either absolute monarchs, fascist leaders or foreign sponsored dictators. But yes, democratically speaking few progress was made. But as long as you can't prove that totalitarian governments necessarily follow socialist economies this really doesn't prove anything.

&gt;The problem with old socialism is that it leads to the new socialism. Your ideology sure is appealing as they describe it but it always fails because we're greedy humans and power corrupts and people only want what's better for themselves, nobody actually cares more about the poor and the needy in a socialist system than they do in a free market one. It's like religion, just because you might believe in it with all your strength, that doesn't make it true, we're still going to be whom we are.

I'm not the kind of socialist that denies human nature. But, apparently, a society is possible that seek to ban poverty by force of law, versus societies that accept it. Maybe you prefer the latter, I don't. 

And what about racism and apartheid? Is that part of human nature, because it certainly looked like it 50 years ago. But then there were states, with the USSR as the avant garde, that proved it wasn't.

&gt;No, it was precarious because it was poorly designed and dysfunctional, it was overthrown because it was socialist, not despite being socialist.

The West used anything except nuclear force in it's fight against communism. That doesn't mean inherent aspects of socialism didn't made it weak in the 80s, but then you can't also deny that inherent aspects of it made the USSR strong after the revolution till during and after the second world war. You're understanding rest on a simple dychotomy ""socialism bad, free market good"".

true,PrePerPostGrchtshf,FRAN,France,"&gt;Parliament should be a legislative organ, not an advisory one.

It is a legislative organ under the [co-decision procedure](http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/index_en.htm), which means a lot of what the EU legislate as. (you can think of the EU as a kind of bicameral system for stuff that fall under this procedure, with legislation being initiated by the Commission). The EU system is quite complicated, there are many specific procedures for specific areas of legislation, but the co-decision procedure is more and more prevalent (it was renamed ordinary legislative procedure). Something a lot of people don't understand is that the EP has a lot of power (it can make amendments more easily than the council).

&gt; The Commission should pretty much be abolished.

Why? The Commission kicks ass, think of it as an executive (it applies that laws voted by parliament/council) that is not affected by day to day politics (except it kinda is to an extent).

&gt; As should the CAP (and if we want to be sure of food security, we can make an FTA with Ukraine, and in future maybe include them. If each country wants a strategic food independence, they haven't understood the whole point of the EU)

We have food security now allright, we make massive amounts of food just in France alone =P The thing is that it originally was a sorta deal between France and Germany (we protect French Agriculture vs we make a market for german industrial goods). Anyways, I pretty much agree, but that is a matter for Member States to decide, the EU institutions themselves have no say in the matter.


&gt; Tobin tax on all financial transactions. Any country that refuses will lose free trade privileges, at least for trade in financial products (I'm looking at you, UK).

Again, national governments through the drafting of the EU treaties do that. The EU can't raise taxes on its own. (which I think it should)

Second, I'm not saying that there *isn't* access to water in your country - we have access to water throughout Europe and in most countries the water supply is still under communal control.
I have, however, seen a [report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq4ncp-iNNA) (in German, there seems to be a transcript on the right2water site though) about the plans of the EU commission to open the markets. I personally am against that, because many attempts in privatising water supplies from what I heard have turned out rather negative for the people: Dramatically rising prices and often lower quality. 
In the report they show a portuguese community that sold its water supply to a private company as a ""field test"" for the planned privatisation of the market in Portugal. From what the community says, the water prices have risen over 400% in the last few years, while the quality has declined. 
In my opinion, something as vital as water shouldn't be subject to the free market, I'm very very sceptical about the possible consequences (like the example written above). At least, quality and prices should be under strict regulations. 
That's why I wrote ""prevent"" - it's a preemptive measure against plans that are seemingly in motion inside the EU. 

From this thread, however, that there are many people who see that differently, especially from the UK. I'm glad that a discussion has been started and yes, if you don't support the cause, don't sign the petition. 

The headline *is* sensationalistic. Absolutely. I'm aware of that - I was, however, simply adapting the rhetoric of the campaign, mainly because I think it might get people interested in looking into the site and not just browsing over it - like you did, for example, so thanks for that.

true,captainhamster,EURO,Special Snowflake,"A comprehensive plan for integration of the current EU (or a part thereof). I'd like there to be an agreed upon course that plots our future. Right now there's so much uncertainty in where we are going that it creates distrust or apprehension. It's becoming increasingly difficult to take a bold step forward, but that's exactly what I want. I want that exciting feeling of something new being forged, something big.

The EU has expanded a lot the past few years, so I suppose in part that is why I want a 'deepening' rather than a 'broadening' of the EU for now. I don't really mind if it doesn't include everything I'd wish for, but some things I'd really like to see:

* Integrated digital and online business/practices, to streamline online services and business.

* An increasingly common phone provider system, that is at the least more compatible than now. The limits on roaming fees in the EU was a big step in this direction.

* Fiscal union of some sort, along with our current monetary one.

* A vastly increased focus on EU-wide research projects and institutions (modelled after ESA or CERN or such).

* Creation of a number of Battlegroups (such as the Nordic one) instead of an EU army, and for this to slowly replace our current NATO system (I'm not a fan of NATO).

* (Objective) teaching about the EU to be a much larger emphasis in national school curricula.

* No more CAP (at least vastly diminished).

* Effective legislation against current banking and financial services industries (I've left this vague as I'm unsure as to what would be the best).


----------------------

I realise many of these might require a new treaty, but that's a good thing for me, not a bad one. It's a step forward. Lisbon was ambitious in trying to reform the EU institutional structure and legal system, but was curtailed due to nitpicking. I would truly like a treaty that simplifies and clarifies the EU, rather than add another complex layer. Cutting red tape, so to speak.

Ja, geistiges Eigentum wird von materiellem getrennt betrachtet, weil es gravierende Unterschiede gibt. Es ist dennoch vergleichbar (was nicht heißt durch und durch gleichzusetzen), da es eben auch massive Parallelen gibt.

VW hat keine Verwendung für Millionen von Autos, sondern nur für das Geld, das sie für den Verkauf bekommen.

Was bei dieser ganzen Diskussion auch immer wieder vergessen wird - so erscheint es mir jedenfalls - ist, das auch materielles Eigentum nichts weiter als ein gesellschaftliches Konstrukt, eine Vereinbarung ist.

No. I didn't imply that it *is* happening in Sweden right now, at least that wasn't my intention and I'm not sure how you read that out of the title, however polemical it might be. 
The word ""prevent"" just implies that there is a strong possibility of it happening in the future. 

It is already practice in bailout countries to push water privatization to reduce national debt: http://www.neurope.eu/article/commission-favor-water-privatization-countries-receiving-bailout

The EC ""encourages governments to open these services [i.e. water] (""services of general economic interest"" or SGEIs) up to competition"" [1](http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/opening_en.html) 

[Here](http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/Reply%20to%20Mrs%20zanzanaini.PDF%5B1%5D_0.pdf) is a letter confirming that. Yes, it says corporate monopolies shall be prevented and it shall be consumer friendly etc., but I and many other people are skeptical about that. 

[The report I was talking about earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq4ncp-iNNA), courtesy of the German news magazine ""Monitor"". It is in German, but [here](http://www.right2water.eu/de/news/monitor-commission-plans-water-privatisation) is an English transcript. 
I know you will be skeptical seeing as the transcript is provided by right2water but I can assure you that it is correct and German speaking Redditors can confirm that. 
The portuguese community displayed in the report doesn't benefit from the privatization efforts at all.

Like I said: I'm NOT saying that water is being privatized right now in your country, **but** it could be, if it goes according to the intentions of the EC. And some people want to prevent that from happening, because if not regulated properly, water privatization can turn out pretty bad: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Cochabamba_protests

To quote /u/embicek from this very thread: 
&gt; In Czech Republic many of city water utilities were privatised during the early 90's. The main result are price increases every year, over thousand of percents over the time. 


**Edit:**
Again, I am **NOT** affiliated with right2water in any way, I just felt like it is a cause I want to support and share. Using this subreddit, because I was sure many people here would be interested as well.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; You might not think of the issue of divine rule. Other people, meaning people that are not you, do think of that. The Monarch is also the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. This is not a random motto and a random title for millions of Anglicans.

It's not an issue of belief in this case. The fact is that at least one war and one revolution occurred in the UK over the issue of the so called ""Divine Right To Rule"". Parliament executed Charles I for treason in the C17th, which would never have happened if we had accepted his assertion, in court, of his ""Divine Right To Rule"". Later that century, we had the Glorious Revolution, in which we forcibly removed James II, and replaced him William of Orange, a foreigner. In the following century we further asserted the right to pick our own Monarch by fighting the Jacobites, who wished to place the ""rightful"" Monarch back on the throne. 

The fact is, that at least in the UK, the Monarch rules only with the consent of Parliament. There is no accepted ""Divine Right To Rule"", and there hasn't been for 300 years. 

&gt; It is a taboo issue for the vast majority of the people of the UK. 

It is not taboo, I discuss it frequently with many people. It even gets discussed in public, the last time being 2012, during the Jubilee celebrations. It pops up as a topic on programs like Newsnight. The Guardian newspaper declared itself in favour of a Republic decades ago. It still occasionally pops up as a topic *there*, in one of the most popular newspapers in the country. It is very far from being a taboo topic. 

&gt; It is considered unpatriotic to question the Monarchy. 

Hmm. No, it honestly isn't. 

&gt; Other people from the UK think the same, some of them commenting below. I also remember people writing to the Queen and asking for a referendum. The Palace responded something along the lines of ""the people of the UK have no interest in this matter"". How the hell do they know? Did they ask them about it? The answer is NO. 

Oh, come on, there are frequent polls on the subject. Although I would prefer a republic, you must faces facts and realise that the majority, at the moment, are simply not in favour of it. 

&gt; So, spare us the insults. People have differing opinions and you might not always be right about something, get used to it.

Though I would still be careful with that because a productive worker in Germany that works for €10/hour will still be more valuable than an €6/hour European who doesn't have the same tools and equipment as Germany. Minimum wage affects overall wage cost, just like many regulations do, but is just a part of the determining factor. The main reason for example why Germany managed to drop unemployment after the Hartz reforms was not because of the absence of minimum wage but because of simply, a drop in wages. Which makes more sense. Compared with Germany's historically high productivity this was pretty effective. Greece on the other hand is one of the most unproductive countries in Europa but kept wages high with debt. Which became a road to disaster.

And I don't deny social mobility, but it's irrelevant. There's always only one group of people that take economic decisions, and I don't see why capitalist class should be a dirty word, as capital is the basis of their power.

Btw, it's not because we agree on this that I support dropping wages to solve unemployment.

It's not about the destruction of rights, but rather the bolstering of them.

In relevant part:

&gt;**Household exemption**

&gt;Under the 1995 Directive, the processing of personal data “by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity” is excluded from its scope. The European Commission has recognised the need to continue to exempt certain types of domestic data processing from the proposed Regulation: article 2.2(d) provides that the Regulation will not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person “without any gainful interest” in the course of his or her own “exclusively personal or
household activity”.

&gt;This provision seeks to draw a line between those processing activities which are personal and those which are commercial in nature. The exemption will not apply, therefore, if an individual has a “gainful interest” or if the activity is not “exclusively” of a personal or household nature. For example, if an individual decided to sell a musical instrument or rare book online, he or she would fall outside the scope of the household exemption and the provisions of the Regulation would apply.

&gt;Therefore the Presidency invites Ministers to discuss—
whether the scope of the proposed household exemption is correctly or toonarrowly defined in article 2.2(d);
if too narrowly defined, in what way the scope should be extended; for example, by replacing “gainful interest” with “professional gainful interest” and by taking into account the frequency or occasional nature of the activity.

...

&gt;**Right to be forgotten**

&gt;Building on the data subject’s existing right to erasure of personal data, article 17 of the Regulation provides for a new “right to be forgotten”. The objective is to ensure that individuals have the power to require controllers that store their personal data to erase them once they are no longer needed for any legitimate purpose. It will mean that if an individual no longer wants his or her personal data to be processed – especially data supplied while he or she was a child – and there is no legitimate reason for keeping them, the data must be erased from the controller’s system. This new right takes account, in particular, of evolving technologies and practices and addresses the risks of possible financial, reputational or psychological detriment to data subjects in the context of social networking sites.

And even if it *were* about the destruction of rights, that couldn't be done, since those rights are constitutionally enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU:

&gt;Article 8

&gt;**Protection of personal data**

&gt; 1. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.

&gt; 2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of theperson concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to
data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.

&gt; 3. Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independent authority.

true,NuclearWookie,null,null,"&gt;This kind of globalism leads to a downward spiral where the businesses simply get what they want, wages on par with the lowest in the world.

That hasn't actually happened, even in countries with modest wage protections such as the US. That's kind of why businesses are still offshoring to places where labor isn't cheap and excessively entitled. 

&gt;The problem has never been socialists

It's always been socialists. Their greed leads them to destroy economies. The politicians you elect to office today can bribe you with your own money and the money of others, but they just create intense pressure for the businesses affected to move to a less hostile country. After the confiscated wealth is wasted away the population wants even more, yet the tax base is smaller because businesses have moved away. If you want to talk about a downward spiral, notice how that is the exact situation currently being played out by European social democracies like Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. 

&gt;Hence, the only option left will be to take public control of our economy on an international scale.

Since that has resulted in famine, labor camps, and mass executions in the past, no thank you. Whenever government controls the economy it is utterly unable to allocate resources efficiently or fairly since economic necessity takes a back seat to both corruption and politics. Capitalism may have problems, but they are nowhere near as severe as the problems that happen in a command economy.

true,annoymind,null,null,"In most parts of the world vegetarianism is probably seen as an exotic illness. Most cultures have a heavy focus on meat or other animal products. In some European countries there might be larger numbers of vegetarians and thus people start to adopt. But think about people in your family or acquaintances who are not vegetarians. What would they serve if they had some special guest for dinner whom they didn't know? Very likely it would be a meat dish.

In north-western Europe you'll certainly find more vegetarians and restaurants and people start to adopt. But go to eastern or southern Europe it changes. As a vegetarian travelling the Balkans? You'd probably starve unless you can survive on onions alone.

And as the article says: If you are in a country where vegetarianism is exotic then be aware that even dishes that might look/sound like containing only vegetables can contain animal stock or lard or might have been cooked with some trotters/bones in them. Actually it's not unlikely that you encounter that in the UK as well. I recently went to a Chinese restaurant with a vegetarian friend. They had all kinds of vegetable dishes. But I realised they seemed to use one large stock pot as the base for many dishes and I wouldn't be surprised if that contained some chicken stock as well. I didn't tell my friend and we both enjoyed the meal.

But in my opinion that's something vegetarians have to understand: You can't fully experience a foreign culture if you have such limits. (The same if you don't drink alcohol.) In many cultures eating meat and drinking alcohol is a very important social aspect. And it's a bit ignorant in my opinion to go to a foreign country, wanting to experience a foreign culture and then demanding all those extras.

However, if you argument against the monarchy is that the king is some kind of tyrant or just that he is too stupid to be head of state I must protest. The king does nothing of any political importance. In fact, he is constitutionally forbidden from doing so. He isn't and can't be a despot under the current system, and it doesn't matter if he's a moron because he doesn't do anything, politically speaking. Now, if the argument is that from a democratic principle there shouldn't be a king in the first place I have no objections, because that's a good argument.

Furthermore as per our constitution the head of state has very few functions, meaning that it is in fact entirely irrelevant if the person holding the position does or does not have brains or an education. It also means that if we abolish the monarchy we won't be directly electing our head of state anyway. The position will be an appointed one, chosen by the parliament or even the prime minister. Look to the German model for something akin to what I'm talking about. Likely in fact the first speaker of the parliament (riksdagens förste talman), who is not directly elected as I'm sure you know, is going to be our new head of state if the monarchy is abolished. Constitutionally speaking the first speaker already performs much of the functions of the head of state in the king's stead (however, I'd like to reiterate, those functions are entirely symbolic in nature), so it's a natural choice.

Like you said, if tax money is going to be spent it should be spent on something worthwhile. A national election of a symbolic position with no inherent power or de jure influence is a massive waste of money, and thus we won't be having any.

How on earth, you can get from ""Water campaign"" to *your* title, without the heaviest of editorialising and sensetionalism, I don't know. 

Second- you said it was for a good cause. So, aren't they all? 

If I wanted to provoke a debate, I could have for example (looking at r/europes frontpage) posted a link that says [Fucking France hates gay people](http://www.dw.de/thousands-protest-in-paris-against-gay-marriage/a-16518660). *That* would surely provoke a debate, to a cause that is also good and dear to me - gay rights. That must surely count as a good cause - right? However, doing that would be a lie since the title would be completely incorrect, most of France doesn't hate gays and it is just wrong and provocative.

Another idea: [The French are loosers](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/9798891/French-capital-flight-spikes-as-Hollande-hits-business.html) (good finances are very dear to me, it is for a good cause you know, if the economy goes well, the French can support the environment more....). 

So, if everyone did like you, how do you think the front page would look like? 

What makes your cause so much more worthy than everyone elses? What makes you the exeption to the rule?

I'd like for you to answer that please.

&gt;No. I didn't imply that it is happening in Sweden right now, at least that wasn't my intention and I'm not sure how you read that out of the title, however polemical it might be.

...""privatization in Europe through the EU....""

Through the EU implies the EU, if you haven't understood that. Otherwise, you write southern Europe, or more specific, Portugal and Greece, which I understand is the case.

This is another reason why you shouldn't write your own titles, obviously you didn't graps that ""in Europe through the EU"" is read as exactly what it says, *not* as southern Europe. Why didn't you just write that then? Nórthern Europe is not a part of the EU perhaps?

&gt;The report I was talking about earlier,
&gt;http://www.neurope.eu/article/commission-favor-water-privatization-countries-receiving-bailout

etc


I know what you are talking about *and* I would happily have discussed it had you bothered to just start an open discussion about it, since I find it an important issue (for example, the CAP is most certainly not adjusting to the climate changes and the water issues we are facing), but I really don't want to. You just you made me click on something  by lying (OK editorializing/sensationlism) and why would I want to discuss it then.

If I want false advertising, I turn on the TV or open a magazine. I am attempting to escape it here on at least a few subreddits. No matter the cause, what you wrote is still false advertising. I doubt that you know anything about the water situation in the Nordic countries.

&gt;If the news behind the campaign turn out to be hot air, I'm fine with that and I don't feel like there's harm done.

OK, why is your issue so much more important that anyone elses, that you can ""lie"" in the title. Is the intentions is all that counts, I am sure you are fine with every singe title on r/europe being changed, but it would soon make this subreddit unreadable. Are your intentions much more noble than other peoples?

true,JB_UK,null,null,"To pad this out a bit, the NHS works through regional/local Primary Care Trusts. They are set up by government to cover a particular geographical area, and they commission services and set up treatment pathways (for instance, cancer treatment services) from hospitals within, or sometimes outside their area. 

PCTs make their decisions with advice from other evidence-based policy making bodies, the local Strategic Health Authorities, and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.

Hospitals used to be run by central government, but there's been a movement towards making each of them independent, as so-called Foundation Trusts. So they exist as financially separate organizations, each tendering for services from PCTs, and also now encouraged to take in private patients to make money which can be spent on other services.

General Practitioners operate mostly through their own  privately owned practices (a holdover from the original compromise with the doctors' union when the NHS was created), and play a strong gatekeeping role for patients, so that all referrals go through GPs, except in emergencies. They are also financially incentivized to roll out certain nationally encouraged treatment programme, for instance getting people over 60 to take a flu jab, or to get someone with high blood pressure onto statins. 

There are big reforms underway at the moment, which will shift responsibility for commissioning from the Primary Care Trusts, to consortia of GPs. So a GP, rather than finding himself assigned to a.PCT because of his geographical location, will now be able to choose to join any of the consortia, according to which he thinks does its job well. It's not yet known whether the consortia will end up being local, regional or national in scale.

In comparison to the French system, it's quite paternalistic, because patients can't self-refer, but must always go through GPs, and GPs are expected to use preset treatment pathways. But the flip side is that it is cheaper as a result. Also, there is no copayment system, everything is free at the point of delivery, except for small prescription charges. Oh, and finally, there's nominally NHS coverage for dentists and opticians, but in reality it is so patchy that most people use private services.

true,FrisianDude,FRIE,Friesland,"Ah. Firstly; I disagree with the idea that Normans were Vikings. Yes fine, Rollo and his immediate family were probably from Norway. He probably brought a few boatloads of Norweegies to that bit. Where they did what? They mingled. The intermarried with those already there, Frankic and Celtic, they accepted their position as vassal of the Frankic overlords, and eventually a wholly different sense arose; they were not Franks. But they were not Vikings either; they were the *Gens Normannorum*. They were Normans. They considered themselves distinct from their neighbours, but one could say that by about the eleventh century (Rollo had landed in the ninth, if I'm not mistaken) they had closest ties to Bretagne, Flanders and multiple Anglo-Saxon families. After all, William, via Harold, had something resembling a claim on the fledgling and newly formed English kingdom. By 1066 the Normans would have felt far closer relateed to the Anglo-Saxons in England than to the Barbarians in the North. 

To claim Normans are frankified vikings seems one of the most strident oversimplifications common to Anglophones and only so they can consider themselves more Viking. Which is baffling in itself. Vikings are among the most exaggerated groups of people ever, what did they do, exactly? They traded here, the plundered there, they mercenaried elsewhere, oh, and they founded Kiev and some other cities. Big whoop. :P

true,HansAdler,,Muttersprachler,"I recommend setting the keyboard to US International with deadkeys. The layout is essentially the standard US layout (no need to change the physical keyboard!), but there are two important changes:

* The keys ""'`~^ become deadkeys. I.e. after pressing them, nothing happens at first. If they are followed by a space or an appropriate letter, they appear on their own or over that letter, respectively. So "" has to be entered as "" followed by a space, and äöüÄÖÜ is entered as ""a""o""u""A""O""U. Also ~n~N appears as ñÑ.
* The right Alt key gets the AltGr function. Combine it with s to get ß. Combine it with , or &lt; to get ç or Ç.

The deadkeys are a bit inconvenient when you need their symbols in the usual way (not as accents), but you can get used to this. The only real problem is that some software gets confused about this. A minor problem is that operating systems differ in how they deal with non-standard input such as pressing """". (Some helpfully turn this into "", some less helpfully into """", and some beep or do nothing.)

I am German and fluent with both German and US layouts. I have switched completely to this keyboard setting, even with German physical keyboards, because it's better for programming than the German layout -- []{} are easier to reach -- and still allows me to enter German letters and even French/Italian/Spanish accented letters easily.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-International#US-International

If you can't get used to deadkeys, follow aeiouh's advice and use US International without deadkeys.

Yes. I see your point there, and again I apologize for offending your standards. I understand. I can not change it back, though, so I will keep it. My title was not a headline, it was a call-up. 
And I have understood that that bothers you. Could we keep it at that?

&gt; What makes your cause so much more worthy than everyone elses? What makes you the exeption to the rule?

I don't know, actually, probably nothing. It's just a topic that didn't get much exposure and I thought it would be worthy to share. And judging by the reception of my post, other people seem to feel the same way. 
My intention are not more noble than others and I have never said or implied that with anything I wrote, neither in my title nor in my contributions to this thread. 
I shared a site and more people liked than disliked it. That's the way this site works - I did not upvote the post all by myself, you know. 

&gt; ...""privatization in Europe through the EU....""

&gt; Through the EU implies the EU, if you haven't understood that. Otherwise, you write southern Europe, or more specific, Portugal and Greece, which I understand is the case.

&gt; This is another reason why you shouldn't write your own titles, obviously you didn't graps that ""in Europe through the EU"" is read as exactly what it says, not as southern Europe. Why didn't you just write that then? Nórthern Europe is not a part of the EU perhaps?

And AGAIN you happened to leave out the key word here, which is **PREVENT**, which means ""to keep something from happening"", i.e. before it has actually happened or in this case has taken full effect.

It does NOT mean that it is already happening throughout Europe, but it is a growing trend in certain parts of Europe, backed up by an EU wide agenda to support the privatization of water supplies, as you can read on the EC site I provided a link to. 

I'm not sure if you're trying to prove a point about your perception of my ""lies"" here, but right now you are just putting words into my mouth / twisting around what I wrote - to make a point about me ""deceiving readers into thinking that the EU privatizes Swedish water supplies at this moment""?

true,Gandzilla,null,null,"it's one of the biggest problems in germany and ""freedom"" IMHO, you either go the current route and ban denial of the holocaust, books like mein kampf and so on, or you actually let democracy happen. Is it worth cutting into the freedom of people to prevent ww2 germany from ever happening again (if that was even possible) ? In the US they allow very open freedom of speech, to a point where teenagers are even allowed to raise the confederate (south US during the civil war, slavers) flag in the morning in front of a school whereas in germany the swastika is simply banned from pretty much ever appearing except for historic documentations. To the point where they were banned on patches that had them crossed out, e.g. http://www.fontblog.de/wp-content/durchgestrichenes_hakenkreu.jpg). It cuts into the right of Freedom of speech but protects the other citizens from hate speeches and various other problems that come with extremist mindsets.

Then on the other hand you have the problem that is beeing discussed right now, if you ban their political or private places where they gather (like the tried split of the burschenschaften that happened last year or the tried (and failed) ban of the NPD a decade or so ago), it just makes them disappear more and makes them harder to track. At the same time it probably should make it harder for them to find new ""recruits"".

true,Munegascu,Lorraine,Lorraine,"As a student in southwestern France, I'd strongly recommend the Toulouse area, which has a strong activity, busy airport with daily connections to London airport. The Toulouse area is also the hotbed of the aeronautical industry, thus many engineering schools are settled around this area. I'm in one of them and many of our English teachers are natives from England or even Scotland and Ireland. Which means that you could teach English in my school for example. 

However, many of these natives often told me, unlike said before, that people from the North are far nicer and friendlier than people from the south. My Irish teacher said that he found that people in Toulouse were not always smiling and friendly. But, when he flew to Strasbourg - near the German border -, he found everyone way friendlier and sensed a huge difference between these two regions.

All in all, we have a great quality of life anywhere in France and the south may seem more attractive at first. Sun is a big plus, but trust my opinion as a born and raised northeastern man studying in the southwest : the weather may be warmer in the south but what is it compared to the warmth with which people from the North would welcome you ? 

Cities I'd recommend in the southwest : 

* Toulouse (dirty city though)
* Albi, where I currently live, outstanding medieval small town with many higher education schools

In the Northeast : 

* Nancy, I spent two years studying here and it is an awesome city with a lot of cultural heritage and not far from major European towns such as Luxembourg or Frankfurt. A friend of mine, from Normandy told : 'Damn, this city is like a museum'. You'd see what he means if you happen to wander in the city centre. Big squares with ironworks and amazing city lights. Best place to go : [Place Stanislas](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs14/f/2007/113/1/5/Nancy__mon_amour_by_agateway.jpg). To me, it's the most outstanding square in France. For obvious reasons.

So wie kein einziges deutschsprachiges Reddit Sub irgendein Gewicht hat (weder /r/de noch österreich,schweiz,germusic usw..), sind dann wegen der immerwiederkehrenden Parolen StudiVZ,Shortnews usw. im Nirvana versunken.
Daraus resultiert dann auch, dass ""wir"" facebook zerstören werden - die Usergruppen dort beweisen bereits wie die ""gefühlten Digital-Natives"" jedwede Banalität und Dogmatismus massenhaft anliefern.
Facebook-Gruppen zum Thema Hackfleisch (z.B. JungVonMett) haben eine Facebook-Etiquette für das Posten von Bildern von Hackfleisch, Muttis nutzen FB für Geburtstagskarten-FB-Apps usw...
Und das auch nicht erst seit jeder Idiot den KONY2012 Link ""teilen"" wollte...nein, die Idioten sind von Anfang an da....denn die Deutschen haben weniger ""Digital Natives"" als andere entwickelte Nationen.

Die Eltern von Nazi666 haben Ihre Informationen noch aus dem Videotext bezogen und halten sich heute für kompetent genug ihren Blagen die Sicherheitseinstellungen von Facebook anhand eines Ratgebervideos im DrittenProgramm zu erläutern.
Ohne das auch nur einer von denen das ISO/OSI 7Schichtenmodell verstanden hat.
Und das geile ist, selbst die Länder die später als Deutschland Internet bekommen haben, sind heute weiter.

How can it really matter so much that they want to see themselves as Macedonian, even though indeed a good portion of their ancestry will be Slavic? I've said it before and got downvoted, but do you really think Greek population itself never changed even the slightest? 

Greece and Macedon are arguing about a very much shared ancestry; Macedonian hegemony may have been based in part on Philip and Alexander's interest and love for the Greek culture, but even slightly after Alexander the Macedonians were more than a bit fed up with the Greeks, really. I mean, when Philip II was murdered Alexander had to fight off multiple claimants, had to cow the Illyrians, the Triballi and the Thracians back into submission and what happened while he was doign that? Why, the Greek states rose up in half-arsed rebellion again. Except Sparta because Sparta had been left alone. To be quite honest, I don't think *anyone* should claim to be Alexander's heirs any more than anyone else, neither the FYROM nor Greece.

- Greek population has not really changed that much since Alexanders time. Im not saying it hasnt at all, but the majority of migrations that happened after the Romans came was between Greece itself. 

Remember During Alexanders time and before Alexanders time each city-state saw themselves as there own country. So Sparta/Macedonia/Athens/Each Island and countless other city-states were there own country and people married only other people within each city-state.

What Alexander did was destroy these boundaries and create a unified country and also created the 1st Greek army which spread culture between the city-states.

The Macedonians(real Ones) were 100% greek, but because they were up in the North mountainous areas and were not as ""sophisticated"" and ""intellectual"" as the Athenians they were always looked down upon by the smug Athenian intellectuals. 

After the Romans conquered Greece, the main migrations in Greece did not come from outside Greece but from within Greece and the city-states who now had freedom to travel around and interact with other villages/cities without fear. So Spartans married Athenians who married Macedonians who moved to greek islands etc. This never happened before Alexander/Romans came. 

So yes Alexanders Macedonian people do not exist anymore neither in Greece nor FYROM but Greece contains the people whos ancestors dated back to Alexanders Macedonia and who has the rightful claim to Alexanders people.

The Slavics who exist now in F.Y.R.O.M. came around during 400-600 AD when the whole of Europe was moving around and changing after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. 

 -Greece would rather have Turkey in the EU 100x more then FYROM. Most people in Greece and Turkey have no harsh feelings towards each other, maybe a bit of mis-trust but that is to be expected.

Nazis are a joke inside Greece, the Mainstream media of Europe has gone overboard with there fear-mongering.  Want to know why Golden Dawn went from nobodies to 8% of the vote? Because the people who voted for them were doing so in a ""protest vote"". They did so to tell the government that something has to be done about immigration and it is a serious issue. Golden Dawn will slowly fade away over the next few years until they are back to there usual 2-3% polling.

- Vandalismus an BVG-Kameras ist Unfug, da die Kameras dort quasi durch politischen Willen hängen. Um die Kameras wegzukriegen, muss man Einfluss auf die Politik nehmen (Piraten, etc.).

- Les travaux de recherche qui avaient mis en place de vraies méthodologie dans les années 90 semblent indiquer que quand il y a un ratio de 2:1 entre l'estimation des organisateurs et de la police, c'est généralement la police qui est plus proche de la vérité (dans leurs mesures elle sous-estimait seulement de 10%)

- Plusieurs méthodes peuvent être employées : le compte-personne quand un cortège est relativement fin et lent, mais généralement, on utilise une mesure de la superficie prise par le cortège ou par l'occupatioin d'un endroit. Il y a un ratio de presque 2:1 qui est incompressible car la police considère qu'il y a 1 manifestant au mètre carré et les syndicats, 1.5, de plus la police considère que ne manifestent pas les gens qui sont sur le trottoirs mais uniquement ceux sur la chaussée. Mathématiquement, il est impossible qu'il y ait une différence de moins de 50%, et avec les estimations de surfaces différentes, le 100% de différence est quasi-garanti.

- Les gens à l'intérieur de la manif sont de très mauvais estimateurs du nombre de participants, même s'ils sont persuadés du contraire.

- Une photo de plusieurs centaines de milliers de personnes est à peu près impossible à faire. Les photos de boulevards remplis dépassent rarement 100 000 personnes. Pour vous donner une échelle, la photo linkée ici, des JMJ, comporte seulement 142 650 pixels. Vous aurez du mal à trouver une image vous montrant 300 000 personnes et encore moins 800 000.

It is painted as his opposition to Turkish membership in the wikipedia article, while the original source contradicts this as mere concern that Turkish membership of the EU will require a completely different approach from the previous enlargement waves. Because adding Turkey will mean that new values, cultures and traditions will enter the Union that are far more different from the ""norm"" of the EU than when other European countries joined. His opinion was that the EU should complete its restructuring (which was still ongoing back in 2004) before talking about such a radical expansion. 

He never actually opposed the expansion, he merely considered the timing back in 2004 to be not optimal due to the restructuring and lack of popular support. In fact, the original Dutch source wikipedia refers to is a rebuttal to such accusations of not wanting Turkey in the EU which were made by the British and Turkish press taking these two sentences quoted on wikipedia out of context back in 2009.

And besides, even if he did oppose Turkey in the EU it still does not make him any less suited as president. The EU is built on consensus and compromise, not personal opinions. Everyone gets a voice and personal opinion but abides by the compromise that everyone else agrees with.

Je pense que le gouvernement pense que s'il n'avait rien fait ce serait développé une zone de non droit dans tout le sahel et que par effet domino ils auraient dû finir par intervenir plus tard pour un coût (humain et militaire) plus important. Les zones de non droit permettent au terrorisme de se développer beaucoup plus facilement et se révèlent néfastes pour les populations (quoi qu'on pense de l'intervention américaine en afghanistan, faut pas oublier que les talibans sont de vrais salopards.)

La puissance militaire française permet d'empêcher les rebelles d'avancer car une colonne de véhicules est très vulnérable aux raids aériens. Par contre, reconquérir tout le Nord Mali, ça c'est un tout autre boulot qui demanderait plusieurs milliers d'hommes des forces terrestres. Et là ce serait plus une simple intervention mais une vraie guerre.

 Se poserait alors la question de l'objectif final de la guerre : les groupes armés prospèrent car la misère est telle que les types n'ont pas grand chose à perdre à se battre et sont facilement endoctrinés.

La pauvreté est le terreau de la rebellion et une force armée ne conduira pas cette zone à la prospérité.

Dividing Europe like this usually has the most relevance if you look at its historic religions. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Estonia have a mostly Protestant majority? Well CE has been a mix between catholic and Protestants, while EE has been Eastern Orthodox.

There was a map here that divided Europe based on this factor. One thing I found a little out of place is the Estonia was marked as CE, and so were the other Baltic states. Poland is CE, but the other Baltic states should be Eastern Europe due to their Eastern Orthodox heritage, which leaves Estonia with not really anywhere else to look to but Northern Europe.

If Finland is NE, so should Estonia. I don't think making the Baltics it's own category does justice to the similarities it has with its neighbors. It's tricky with them because they're really at the border between 3 civilizations.

I think NE is the only correct classification for them because its really the most consistent classification. I'd imagine Estonia had more in common with Sweden (maybe a few decades in the past) than with Slovenia or Austria.


As I've said, if nothing else, then the similar religious background and climate (because that's pretty important in society building) should make Estonia NE.

It means they've been part of historic WE (that is, they have been either catholic or protestant, not eastern orthodox), but haven't gone around the world setting up colonies. Germany had barely any colonies, so it's debatable whether to call them western europeans or central europeans. Not to mention that CE has a history of being part of the eastern bloc, though with a western culture (same as defined above, it's historic religious affiliations). Again Germany is in-between CE and WE. Sure they had parts that weren't part of the bloc, but they also had a big chunk of the country really one of the more oppressed countries behind the iron curtain. If Austria is CE (it could be argued that it had a big part of how we view CE due to the Hapsburg empire), then it seems that former communist Germany *shouldn't* be just WE.

Germany really is one of those transitional countries, so you're definitely not wrong in thinking they have more in common with WE.

Another way of looking at CE vs. WE is that, in the 19th and 18th centuries, there were really only two cultural powerhouses the rest of Europe looked toward.

Ton problème est bien un problème hardware.

Ton OS n'est pas encore chargé à ce stade. D'ailleurs, tu peux sans doute enlever ton disque dure, ton ordinateur sera parfaitement capable de t'afficher le logo Acer.

Ensuite, quand ça vient du hardware, c'est souvent enquiquinant car le problème peut potentiellement venir de n'importe où. Dans ton cas, les symptômes font fortement penser à un problème de RAM (mémoire vive) car ils sont plutôt aléatoires. Et à la mémoire vive de la carte graphique en particulier puisqu'ils dégradent ton affichage.

Et du coup j'ai une question: est-ce-que tu sais si ton ordinateur a de la mémoire graphique dédiée ? Souvent dans les ordinateurs portable, le processeur principale et le processeur graphique se partagent la même RAM. Si c'est le cas chez toi, alors si ça se trouve ton problème peut être simplement résolu en changeant tes barrettes de RAM.

Si tu ne sais pas où trouver cette information, tu peux me donner le modèle exact de ton PC et je peux aller farfouiller sur le net.

Enfin, tu peux déjà tenter de faire un [www.memtest86.com](www.memtest86.com). Ce programme test la RAM principale de ton PC (il ne test pas la RAM graphique). Si elle est défectueuse, il s'en rendra compte.

&gt;Si le mariage homosexuel me gêne, on peut l'interdire

Justement, c'est exactement ce qui se passe : le mariage homosexuel ne gène plus la majorité, donc on l'autorise. Par contre, le mariage entre parents ou la polygamie gênent encore, donc on interdit.

Pour détailler cet argument, je préciserai qu'il n'y a pas de droit universel au mariage civil. Les limites à la famille et au partage de biens sont uniquement culturelles. Il n'y a donc pas plus de raison d'autoriser le mariage entre personnes du même sexe qu'entre personnes de la même famille ou entre plus de deux personnes. C'est uniquement parce que le mariage homo est ""tendance"" qu'on va l'autoriser, mais ce n'est absolument pas quelque chose d'universel ou d'égalitaire ni même de logique. On a très bien le droit d'être contre sans avoir de haine particulière envers une sexualité.

If you stick strictly to the definition it is binary, however there really is a question over how free *it is good to be* in terms of speech. For instance: Is it ok to say some thing that directly incites violence such as saying ""let's burn this man's house down"". Would following some one around with a megaphone shouting profanity at them be protected under free speech? Most people would have a hard time saying that *should* be protected by law.

There are very few places on the planet which have genuinely free speech in it's strict definition because it's not necessarily a good thing to have. It's not necessarily a bad thing ether. We're in a position to preach because we're in a very good situation in terms of our human rights and our media freedom. The bigger issue with Turkey is that it is criminalising people who we believe have done nothing wrong. Even if our media isn't free, we're certainly in a position to say that they're mis treating people for no good reason (though the whole West isn't perfect on this ether)

You have to buy into the ""West should set the global standard"" argument for this to make sense. I'm not going to argue that we should be imposing our will upon the world and I'm not going to argue the opposite. I think we're in a position to improve some other places like Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya, Syria and Turkey so long as we do so through peaceful means (unless it's for our own protection. That's a different issue.

true,charlofsweden,SWED,Stockholm,"Vi behöver inte nödvändigtvis skriva om hela grundlagen bara för att monarkin avskaffas. Grundlagen i sitt nuvarande utförande har föreskrifter för vad som ska göras om en monark saknas, och det finns ingen anledning att inte gå efter den modell vi redan har. Frågan är helt enkelt vem som blir statsöverhuvud istället för monarken (i grundlagen ska en ståthållare utses om en monark inte finns, samma princip kan utövas bara att förste talman också får i uppgift att utföra de uppgifter ståthållaren rent formellt måste göra, dvs det förste talmannen redan i princip gör). Om du tror att våra politiker är villiga att helt göra om systemet från grunden bara för att monarkin avskaffas tror du fel.

Anledningen att jag tog upp tyranni är för att jag inte ser varför kungen demokratiskt sett annars kan göra skada. Spela roll om han säger dumma saker ibland och är lite pinsam för expatriater: det har ingen som helst demokratisk vikt. Kungen är politiskt maktlös och då spelar det väl ändå ingen roll vem som har posten? Frågan är ifall vi ska ha monarkin kvar eller inte, inte ifall kungen är kompetent eller inte.

Tänk så här: när du säger att bästa argumentet mot monarkin är den nuvarande kungen säger du också underförstått att ifall vi då hade en kung som var kompetent och smart så skulle du inte ha några problem med monarkin. Jag tror inte att det är det du menar.

Det finns bra argument mot monarkin. ""Den nuvarande kungen"" är inte ett sådant.

I don't think the NPD are limiting the freedom of other people with their words.  They may be deliberately reinforcing racist views that were already there, and then individuals may decide to act on their views but I don't agree that the speech itself directly impacts the freedoms of others.    

It's a question of personal responsibility.   I am responsible for my actions, regardless of how much bullshit someone has told me.   I think instead of banning speech, we should be nurturing better opinions, and I know that is hard to accept in a world that is sometimes so violent and hateful.

But as someone that really just wants peace and freedom in the world, I say don't ban the NPD, offer a better alternative to their disgusting views.  Racist parties thrive from poverty and alienation, and racism is an easy outlet for that frustration, as we see in Greece lately.

I wish I could believe that.  But look at the rise of 'golden dawn' in Greece.   They were a nothing party, but as Greece becomes more poverty stricken and desperate, the Greek nazi party becomes more powerful.   All people want is a solution, and an easy solution is to create a scapegoat, and pretend that removing it will solve the problem.

Obviously removing all the immigrants and becoming extremely racist isn't going to solve Greece's problems, but lots of people are stupid and think that it might work.   

Just hypothetically, I'd like to try a little experiment.   Let 'golden dawn' remove all the immigrants from Greece, and have them accomodated in other EU countries with better working conditions than they have now.   Then kick Greece out of the EU, and have no more tourists go there since it's a nazi state.

Just FYI, those are pretty much all micro states. I mean Slovenia is the only one that you can even see one a world map, let a lone point out. Yeah, that line excludes a nation which has *links* with Europe. It's not necessarily European though. Canada and the US are observers on certain EU programs because it is beneficial to do so for both parties. Same with Turkey. But full accession? I'm not saying Turkey can't be an EU member. I'm just saying that the EU's main, underlying goal and principle is to create a united Europe, free of war. Turkey doesn't fall under that category, at least most of Turkey doesn't.

I know it's an arbitrary line. It really is. Unfortuntaly that arbitrary line is one of the things that stops us from trying to over achieve. The guys in Brussels and European capitals would surely love to bring peace and unity to the entire world, but they have to succeed in bringing it to Europe before that. When that works, we can raise our horizons. In the mean time I wish Turkey the best of luck in getting in even before those horizons are raise on different criteria than ""Because it's in Europe"".

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Look it up? Language changes, and that is not the definition that is applied in practice, so I won't use it.

Just because people say Pluto is still a planet, that doesn't change reality. The case is the same here, austerity means cutting public spending, not raising taxes.

&gt;Everyone uses it wastefully, mate. The market does not make things efficient by magic, only when there's strong competition and rights leveling for the case of weak parties.

Which is why we must free the market, to minimise the waste created by monopolies (be them privately or state owned).

&gt;And no, you can't always use it better because you're a much weaker party in negotiations and don't deal in volume. When Americans have a serious disease, there's not even negotiation, they pay or they die. It's not even always clear what's happening until after the fact, like the ridiculous amount of money a degree costs, but for many careers, there's no choice either.

That's why there's insurance for healthcare. Oh, and between someone paying 500€ if he gets sick and paying 1000€ in taxes or paying 0€ if he gets sick and paying 1500€ in taxes, the overall picture is the same, the government acting as insurance isn't an argument for nationalisation.

&gt;Some things can be fixed with laws, others by the state being the primary provider. But if you're going to go the law route, it has to have teeth, it has to be able to close companies and it has to be able to put people in jail.

The law should always prevail. And we already have a massively inefficient state. The best choice is obvious, let the private sector handle it and, at most, regulate it when it proves necessary (like in the case of a natural monopoly, though these are few rare).

&gt;Hollywood also achieves DRM and ridiculous copyright terms, while mostly recycling old shit every year. Color me unimpressed. 

Yeah, you're right, it was a bad example. Though if you read the link I gave you from Bastiat, he provides better ones. The point being, you don't need to subsidise these activities for them to exist.

&gt;There are things that private companies are just not interested in doing because they are not profitable, but that have an unknowable value for the future. I'm not a cultural man, so it's hard for me to say what, but I can point out that without the state interfering there would not be the Internet or the many innovations that came from NASA.

Actually the Internet came because of the Yanks research during the cold war so that they'd still be able to launch a counter-attack if their HQ was destroyed, hardly a good example for good government research as it was the private sector that adapted it for civilian use.

&gt;I think PBS and BBC do a great job that isn't necessarily profitable, and certainly RTP had the fairest reporting in the media. Of course, IMHO.

Yeah, though that opinion of yours doesn't justify the massive burden it creates on the taxpayers whereas SIC and TVI provide just the same service and they don't need your funding.

You could have more money in your pocket at the end of the moment, that money would then be used to satisfy your needs and the employment of someone else doing a service you might value much more than RTP and that's just not possible because the state takes that money away from you so that Jorge Gabriel and the like are paid their wages even though Goucha and the like on the other stations also do the same and not at the expense of society.

&gt;Anyone can be a manager in an hour, and there's no lack of small business here. What happens is lack of oversight over the public offices and most of the money ends up being funneled to things we don't need or are too expensive, but is both a big and small government problem. Banks certainly don't help.

The point I was trying to make was that if the government didn't require so much bureaucracy, employment would go down and the productivity would go up. Opening a business here is a nightmare and it shouldn't be.

&gt;If they don't work you can fire them for free. I fail to see how being able to fire people who do good work for whatever you want is an issue.

Because nobody is that obvious. You can't fire someone because he spends too much time on the coffee machine, constantly goes to the bathroom or spends more time chatting with co-workers as opposed to actually working.

Employers should be free to hire and fire at will, workers should never be able to work less at the expense of the company and with the safeguard that it's too costly to fire them, even though there might be much more productive people out there that are unemployed and can't find employment because even though they work better, it's too costly to fire those who already have worked there for years.

&gt;Oh, yes, with the huge salaries managers like to pay, I'm sure all they lack is a push. And we all know everyone is cut out to be a business owner, why should we even have employees in this country, especially ones who can have a comfortable life? That's terrible!

What do you mean? I'm just saying, if you facilitate the conditions for creating employment, more people will. You won't have the emigration you currently have where people out of university can't find a job and can't create a company and then go outside to do just that.

&gt;There's tons of startups, connected to universities or not, and most of the business in Portugal are very small, so I don't get what problem you're trying to correct.

Then why is our youth unemployment so high? And how many of those startups are successful?

&gt;That is state dependent, some are not like that at all. That creates terrible work conditions, anyway. I've heard they offer other ways for people to get on their feet that we don't, but I admit I haven't researched it. However...

Their conditions are better than ours. We really need to reduce unemployment to give workers a bigger bargaining position, while we don't, you're right, it's hard to negotiate in equal terms with employers.

&gt;Right, like outsourcing to India isn't a huge thing in your role models, which is quickly increasing their unemployment rates. And it's common to fire people who want a vacation, or people who want to go to a funeral. It's not even unheard of to fire sick or pregnant people here, let alone in the US, regardless of how well they worked before.

That's nonsense, companies that do that only lose out, if they want to survive in the market, they can't do that as that's not beneficial for them.

Oh, and all the laws of the world won't prevent you from some assholes doing just that, if they can't cut on the wage or on the vacation, they'll cut somewhere else, so let's not bother with those as they always get what's coming to them.

&gt;There's very little incentive to keep someone who isn't going to be productive for a while if you have to keep pulling your numbers up to have you yearly bonus, especially since you'll be long gone using your ""skills"" elsewhere when the shit hits the fan. That's a common CEO path.

Yes, and that's how it's supposed to be. If someone's productive, they get to be employed, if not, they should be the burden of the company, at most they should be a burden to their families and society. Attaching the misfortunes of some to the company isn't safeguarding the well being of the poor fellow, is jeopardising the employment of everybody who works in said company.

&gt;That's not how people work, period. And people have sickness, depression family problems and all kinds of issues all the time that are only going to be amplified by further stress.

Again, that's life, you shouldn't continue to work in a private company if you can't do your job any more just like a policeman can't continue to patrol the street if he can no longer perform his job. If there's misfortunes, it should never be at the expense of the company, at most it should be something the whole society should take care off.

&gt;If they couldn't before, they can certainly be easily fired for a few years now, so I don't get what you're complaining about.

A few years from now? What if I need to cut costs now, what, should 150 people lose their job because somehow that's better than the 5 less productive people losing theirs?

&gt;Regardless, what you can always do is declare bankruptcy and then restructure however you want, with no issue from the courts.

Hmm I can't really say if i'm against it.

I don't mind it being saved for investigation and prosecution however ""detection"" smells like a loophole that would enable member states to spy on their citizens.

If a warrant is needed in my country I wouldn't mind, otherwise though...

Then again if that's the case, since this depends on the country in question's national law those countries probably already have that option.

I think if with actual good intentions they should further federalize this so that the limitations are the same for each country instead of depending  on each country's law. (probably can't trust all 27 of them)

If not then it should indeed be thrown out of the window.
