true,[deleted],null,null,"Hah! not even close man . . . The greek orthodox priests are family men who raise children and are in relatonships with lifelong partners . . The rate of pedophilia among them are extremely low . . you are just spouting bullshit.

I saw many of the links on that russian website and most of them are not for pedophilia but for physical abuse of there own children . . . 

I do not think you understand the scope of pedophilia in the catholic church . . . TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CASES have been covered up never to be heard about  . . . there are only the occasional leaks by one of the victims(of dozens) from each church where it happens . . . much of this coverup is from the vatican giving the victims millions to keep there mouth shut.

The Greek orthodox church does not have a bastion of evil like the vatican . . the greek orthodox church is not a wealthy kingdom like the vatican and could not be able to pay a single victim millions to keep there mouth shut let alone thousands like the vatican does.

There does not go a week without a new catholic pedophilia case being discovered . . where as I have NEVER heard of a GREEK orthodox priest abusing a kid in my life on any new network american or greek.

Like I said, if the catholic church could possibly allow there ""holy"" men to have loved ones and families maybe it would not be such an epidemic   . . . I never understood why they do not allow them wives anyway . . how can you understand Jesus teachings if you do not understand what true love and family is(the number #1 thing jesus preached about).

Anyway . . keep apologizing for your pedo priests . . . I dont mind destroying your avoidance tactics to protect your pedophile priests.

p.s. Thanks for that link of Mount Athos . . looks like a very charming place, I would like to take pictures there one day.

A few suggestions: 

1. Don't wait till you get here to start studying Spanish. Do it now. Even though you'll probably be taught Mexican (it's compatible with Spanish Spanish) it's well worth the effort. My first few months here I was completely lost and wish I had had the benefit of knowing even the basics. 

2. Once you're here, learn Catalan. The government will pay for your classes, and being a Catalan speaker is a big help in many situations, especially business and employment. The Spanish/Catalan issue is very politically charged (probably more than English/French in Canada) and by learning Catalan you're making a statement that gives you a leg up. Your Spanish classes in Canada will help you learn how the language works, and that's all applicable to Catalan. It's true that Spanish is a lot more useful on a global basis, but don't worry - you'll pick it up by osmosis. 

3. Your accommodations wish list is a pretty tall order. The ""popular"" neighborhoods are pretty much around Gracia, Sant Gervasi, and the Born, as well as parts of the Eixample and the Gothic and Raval quarters. It's been my experience that many North Americans have a bit of culture shock coming to the tiny, dark, old, flats they find in those areas. Also Barcelona's beaches are OK but nothing special so I wouldn't put too much weight on that factor. Take a look at http://idealista.com for an idea of what you can get - and what you'll have to pay - in different neighborhoods. Keep in mind that you'll have to pay first month plus two months' deposit plus an additional month commission to the real estate agent when you move in, and most landlords won't rent to you unless you have an employment contract. 

4. English-speaking architects and software analysts can probably find work in those fields here, but don't forget that unemployment is about 25% (50% for young people) and job offers aren't going to be flooding in. I doubt Barcelona needs anymore expats trying to teach English. 

5. You might think about living outside the city. This is the decision I ultimately made based on value for money, safety (Barcelona doesn't have much violent crime but it's lousy with pickpockets and petty thieves), atmosphere and beach access. I live in Sitges, a beach town about 20 minutes away from the city by train and have a 220M townhouse with seaview, parking and multiple terraces for 1100€/month.

true,Gro-Tsen,null,null,"&gt; Sure, there are irregular verbs, but nowhere near as many as in English.

On the other hand, learning an irregular verb in English means learning two or three verb forms; in French, you need to learn something like the entire present tense and at least one or two forms from every other simple tense.  In France we spend a ridiculous amount of time, in elementary and middle school, learning from the *Bescherelle* the absurdities of the conjugation of such verbs as [résoudre](http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/Annexe:Conjugaison_en_fran%C3%A7ais/r%C3%A9soudre) and [coudre](http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/Annexe:Conjugaison_en_fran%C3%A7ais/coudre) and wondering why the f\*ck they have to be so different.  And a striking number of adults get it wrong.

He did. We just agreed that he raped a child and was convicted for it. If raping children is not preying on children, then I don’t know what is.

&gt; Why?

Because he rapes children.

&gt; How would you know such a thing?

I based that on him being the kind of guy who rapes children, who was “educated” in madrassa, who believes women are wroth less than trash. Perhaps he is a Mother Theresa in the making. I doubt it, and I don’t see why the British should risk their children with a convicted child rapist for the odd chance that he is.

He was “educated” in madrassa, so I assume he was not born in Britain – or that he doesn’t have British citizenship. If he has citizenship all the more reason to lock him up for a long time.

Rape as in assault would be praying one children, but I don't have a hard time imagining a 18 year old getting horny over a 13 year old without beeing a pedophile. Just because the use of the word rape applyies in this situation (apparently.. as a swissgerman, that's weird), and he was convited for it, doesn't mean reality is altered and it becomes what people usually imagine a rape would be.

&gt; Because he rapes children.

Again, what happend seems to be far away from what one would imagine a rape to be, so why should the accused in this case ""have been given the fullest sentence available under the law""?

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;**To what extent does the European sovereign debt crisis reveal the failings of the European welfare state model and to what extent does it reveal the breakdown of European integration?**

It has nothing to do with the welfare state.  

Nothing.  

Both Sweden and Greece have welfare states yet they're poles apart.  Sweden, with one of the world's most highly evolved welfare systems, has also one of the healthiest debt-GDP ratios.  As does Australia on the other side of the planet - which also happens to tax less than the US.  There's certainly grounds for how certain welfare states should be reformed, but they're not in debt *because* of welfare.  Most countries in Europe have a lower debt as a percentage of GDP than the US.

Rather than a breakdown in integration it actually indicates how integrated everything has become.  The problem isn't with one country going down, it's that everybody is now so exposed to everybody else.

&gt;**How much can the U.S. insulate itself from the consequences of Europe's sovereign debt crisis and to what extent should the U.S. government agree to work with European allies to find a solution?**

Perhaps a touchy subject given that some in Europe would argue that the sovereign debt crisis actually started across the Atlantic in the US with some very dubious practices which sold poisoned CDOs as something else!  Other dominoes might have fallen since, but that was the first monolith to tumble.

How well can the US insulate itself?  There's plenty of emerging markets but you can't see what is now the largest global market in the world to suffer and not see everyone else take a burn.

I don't really see what the US government should actively do to help, or why they should feel a need to. 'Don't make it worse' would seem to be the order of the day.  

Fluctuations in the oil price won't help.     
Loss of confidence in the dollar won't help, given that plenty of bourses still stipulate oil price in dollars.       
When the US plays Russian roulette on whether to extend the credit ceiling or to default it might seem like gently rocking the boat, but by the time the vibrations reach Europe it rocks an already jittery market, which affects it disproportionately.  The US can help by simply being stable, considered, with careful spending and a restrained foreign policy.  

Calm and steady wins the day.

&gt;**Should U.S. banking regulators discourage American banks and money market funds from investing in Europe (to limit exposure to potential losses on European investments)?**

If it wants regulators making those sort of decisions and also wants to see the world burn in a trade war -yes.  If not let banks develop their own risk assessment and the markets to work as they should.

&gt;**Should the U.S. government encourage its European allies to hold together the single European currency or should it encourage failing countries like Greece to leave the euro?**

It should absolutely, 100%, stay out of it.  

There are already so many chefs in that particular currency's kitchen.   The soup's pretty ruined as it is, but if it is going to be rescued another voice at the back isn't going to help.

As for Greece leaving the Euro: all of Greece's European debt is Euro denominated.  Greece leaving the Euro won't solve their debt, it will catapult it into the stratosphere.  When Greece simply can't make its repayments everything Greek overseas gets seized.  If that happens they can't pay for fuel.  They can't get credit overseas so their businesses can't import goods.  They're not close to being sustainable.  If you ever hear of somebody trying to compare Iceland to Greece remind them that they're literally endorsing something which would lead to hundreds of thousands of people dying, if not millions.  They wouldn't be able to buy medicine, they wouldn't be able to keep hospitals open, and there'd be very little energy and fuel in a country with a population spread over hundreds of islands, little natural water off the mainland, and where it tends to get very hot.

Yes, once things flatten out they'd have a weak currency so lots of people will want to go there for a cheap holiday and their exports, but when somebody advocates this gently remind them what they will have to go through to get there.  There is no real choice between 10yrs of austerity or leaving the Euro.

&gt;**Should the IMF use its resources- including U.S.capital subscriptions - to bail out rich European countries, or should IMF assistance be limited to technical advice and guidance?**

The IMF should establish its policy on a case by case basis on their own risk assessment.  It should continue doing what it is doing in raising capital by selling SDR bonds.  If a central bank or a government wants to buy these bonds, then that is up to them.  If the IMF agrees to bailout a country let them argue their own terms.  If a country doesn't want the IMF getting involved in their affairs, it should tell them to shoo.

&gt;**Should the Federal Reserve provide access to liquidity in dollars for European banks operating in the U.S. and for European central banks operating in Europe?**
 
Purely a US concern but I'd hope 'No'.  If they're in trouble let them sell assets, survive or die.  From a US perspective before cutting any cheques/checks and pumping in liquidity, I'd think on how the only reason the US has been able to continue writing such checks is because of its unique position as world reserve currency - and the IMF has just started selling SDR linked bonds for the first time.

I don't see how the US flooding the market with rescue-dollars which they'll convert into Euros is going make anything better, only worse.  A weak dollar and a dangerously high Euro is exactly the sickness at moment (well, one of them).  If anything the European Central Bank should be putting the Euro into a controlled dive to get some fuel into the carburettor and oxygen into its engine. 

&gt;**Should the U.S. withdraw the U.S. from global capital markets or work more closely with allies in Europe and elsewhere to draft new rules and regulations to make global markets more stable?**

No, and no.  Global rules makes for global homogeneity and global ruling/government.   The closest I can get behind that is the IMF creating a basket of currencies that is largely self regulating, as they've done with the Special Drawing Rights.  This at least embraces diversity.  Global rules look to strip diversity, and when that happens in nature is when species go extinct.  Diversity is what keeps systems healthy; it's what keeps problems contained when they arise, and it is what ensures competition that raises the bar for everybody.  

The US foreign policy should be to largely stay out of the European crisis which is being horribly managed, to be a stable neighbour, and then to work towards a controlled step down of the USD from world reserve currency status.  It's going to happen in the next 20 years or so anyway, but if the US doesn't plan for it now and start working on it, it isn't this crisis that we need worry about but the one after it.",0,1361119678,null,0,1361195106,0,c8gpl9g,t3_18ovk6,t1_c8gpl9g,t3_18ovk6,null,1431320078,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19

Also, while many people find it very difficult to learn, I think it's actually easier than indo-european languages, but with a steep initial learning curve.

Why is it easier, you ask?

* It has 27 cases. Wait. They are regular, and there are almost no exceptions. They mostly serve the function of prepositions in romanic languages. E.g. instead of ""I'm moving the chair to the table"" you'd say ""chair the table-towards moved"" or instead of ""I'm putting the glass on the table"", it would be ""glass the table-ontop put"". You do not need to know and learn phrases with the correct prepositions (like in german or english). You can always construct the meaning from a finite set of cases.
* You just concatinate the tenses and other stuff at the end of the word. Like the cases.
* No fuss with genders.
* You spell it as you speak it, and you speak it as you spell it. (Take that, french, german, english, ...)
* It has vowel harmony! Learn a language with vowel harmony today, it will enrich your life!
* Word order like Yoda makes you think!
* You'll learn to move your tongue in ways you didn't think possible. This extends to the bedroom.
* The cursing is hilarious and inseperable from the language. ""Horses dick up your ass"" is a normal expression of disagreement. ""Fuck me!"" is (I kid you not) used as an interjection such as ""really?"" or ""well ...""

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"I can only recommend you stuff for France/Paris. Here goes :

&gt; What’s the cheapest option for traveling to France and will it make sense to do it at night?

It doesn't make sense to do it at night. London to Paris is an extremely short ride, be it by train, plane, or even boat. I'd recommend taking the Eurostar (the tunnel train under the sea) cause it's quick, not a hassle like the airport, and you'll get to see the countryside of both south England and northern France rushing by, and you'll be dropped off in the center of Paris. The plane can be sometimes cheaper I guess but it is a hassle, plus you'll be dropped off in the northern suburbs of Paris, which are kind of gloomy and far away from Paris, and have to take the shitty suburb train. Another option which I thought was pretty cool, though it takes some time, is to take a ferry boat that goes from south England to Calais It's actually pretty nice to take a ride on the sea, especially in september/october (I did it then) when it's nicely fresh and windy. It's also probably the cheapest, however it's surely the most time consuming and least practical. From Calais you can then take the high speed train to Paris.

All in all, I'd recommend you take an early morning Eurostar, comfy and practical.

&gt; How long would it realistically take a tourist to visit the Eifel Tower, the Louvre, the Seine River and the Palace of Versailles? And what’s the best way to travel to Notre Dame de Paris?

You can take an entire day and see largely enough of the Louvre, Notre Dame de Paris, and walk around the old neighborhood (Quartier Latin) surrounding both these places. They're very easily accessible, and you should walk from one to the other because those are the nice neighborhoods. September/October isn't the touristy season in Paris, so you probably would have a fairly short wait to enter the Louvre. The Louvre is huge as a mother fucker, so I'd suggest you rather decide beforehand which art or history periods you really want to see, start with them first casually, and then you can ""run"" through other parts of the Louvre if you have to. But the Louvre is definitely too big for you to see everything in only one day. So perhaps you'd want to see the Louvre in the morning, have a lunch break and walk to Notre Dame. Visiting the cathedral should be very quick. Then head by subway to the Eiffel tower which isn't too far away (15 minute train ride, but you'll have to change trains). I don't know how much of a queue there would be at the Eiffel tower, or how long you'd wait. I've only been up there when I was really small. But again, sept/oct isn't the tourist season so it should do.

Take a second day to see Versailles, which is accessible by train into the suburbs, but still at some distance away, and the palace and gardens are fucking huge.

&gt; Is Paris easy to navigate?

Extremely easy. The subway system is extremely dense, fast and easy.

&gt; Are there any city tours I can join without a booking? If so, where’s the best place to find them?

If you want to see the Seine, I could recommend taking a ""Bateau mouche"", these tourist boats that go up and down the river. I believe there are stations for that sort of thing right by the Notre Dame Cathedral (which is next to the Seine). Just go down to it and ask around.

&gt; Recommendations on any good hot spots?

Sorry, nothing really extraordinary comes to mind.

&gt; What’s the night life like?

It's okay I guess. Not incredible. Just regular bars, nightclubs and shit. I wouldn't really know what to recommend really.

&gt; Recommendations on any hostels/hotels?

Sorry, never took a hotel in Paris. But for cheaper housing, I'd recommend you stay at what we call ""auberge de jeunesse"" which is a youth hostel. Usually full of young tourists your age. Like this one : http://www.aloha.fr/index.php but there are many others.",0,1361122893,null,0,1361123563,0,c8gqczt,t3_18o5w5,t1_c8gqczt,t3_18o5w5,null,1431320446,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;1. To what extent does the European sovereign debt crisis reveal the failings of the European welfare state model 

Not at all really. The countries with the most extensive welfare states are not the ones suffering. The problems in the *Eurozone* (which is 17 states out of + 40 that are European) are due to the fact that the Euro is wrongly constructed, it is the most imperfect of currency unions. 

&gt;and to what extent does it reveal the breakdown of European integration?

What do you mean with European integration? What is that? Do you mean integration in the *European Union* (not Europe) and do you refer to financial integration? If you are referring to financial integration in the European Union, it has increased, in particular among the Eurozone countries. Popular support for the union and the Euro however has sunk, but is still high. Europe, the continent, is not and have never been that financially integrated, some countries among them are. I mean, the Nordic countries are somewhat integrated, BeNeLux as well for example, but it is not like Russia and Ireland are integrated. 

&gt;2. How much can the U.S. insulate itself from the consequences of Europe's sovereign debt crisis and to what extent should the U.S. government agree to work with European allies to find a solution?

The Euro is wrongly constructed, the US can't solve that.

&gt;3. Should U.S. banking regulators discourage American banks and money market funds from investing in Europe (to limit exposure to potential losses on European investments)?

No

&gt;4. Should the U.S. government encourage its European allies to hold together the single European currency or should it encourage failing countries like Greece to leave the euro?

If I were them I would just be quiet, Greece will be forced to leave eventually. Perhaps I'd mention it quietly in a talk with Hollande/Merkel/whatever Italian prime minister there will be, but I would not take it as a official policy. I am sure the US are quite prepared for it anyway, it would be professional misconduct not to be.

&gt;5. Should the IMF use its resources- including U.S.capital subscriptions - to bail out rich European countries, or should IMF assistance be limited to technical advice and guidance?

I understand some help from the IMF, but not to the extent it has been given.

&gt;6. Should the Federal Reserve provide access to liquidity in dollars for European banks operating in the U.S. and for European central banks operating in Europe?

No, unless it is a) an emergency to save a country like Germany that is important, but now I am thinking more along the lines of Marshall aid. Not likely. b) perhaps aid, for and to Greece for example when they are needing it after leaving the Euro.

&gt;7. Should the U.S. withdraw the U.S. from global capital markets or work more closely with allies in Europe and elsewhere to draft new rules and regulations to make global markets more stable? 

Don't withdraw. Work with the rest of the world to regulate the market more (both US and European banks for example).

The European sovereign debt crisis reveals the failing of the unified European currency.

Normally, when a country is doing poorly, they can adjust the exchange rate of their currency, to attract more foreign currency (people want to buy from them, when their products are suddenly cheaper), and keep their own money inside the borders (foreign products are suddenly more expensive).

Greece was doing poorly, germany was doing well, and neither of them could adjust the exchange rate of their currency.

There are two ways out of this - one is going ""back"", and abolishing the Euro. The other is to make a centralized economic control, which requires that all involved countries give up more sovereignty. I don't know which is going to happen, but it certainly does not have anything to do with the welfare state models.

For comparison - the US government sends money from the poorer states to the richer states. If they stopped doing that, you'd have a similar situation.

----

**3**

No, there are plenty of opportunities for investments, and if the US investors stopped sending their money here, we'd both lose out. It's true that there is a risk, but it's not like every European country is going to nationalize their entire industry, and refuse to pay foreign stockholders.

----

**4**

Encouraging ""failing countries"" to leave the Euro will do nothing. It's the actual currency agreement that's flawed, and as long as there are more than one country in the Euro, one of them's going to be failing.

The biggest challenge to the EU is the rush that results in so many half-assed reforms. The US *will* encourage the Europeans to hold on the Euro, because there's still hope that it'll create a single strong market that can trade with the US, rather than a smattering of small markets.

----

**7**

The US. should definitely strengthen the rules and regulations to make markets more stable - it's consumer protection of the first order, and not addressing those needs is to abandon the society that needs it.

It's kind of like how English is today, but in the past--we all know English belongs to England, but England is just a tiny part of the Anglophone world today, and once upon a time Persian, which came out of a little area in Iran called Pars/Fars, for centuries was a widely used literary and international language. According to Wikipedia, ""Persian was the only oriental language known and used by Marco Polo at the Court of Kublai Khan and in his journeys through China."" I believe Persian went everywhere the Silk Road did. It's always great when a language crosses national boundaries (well, I think it's great). In addition to widely exported, it also exerted enormous influence over other languages, and even lead to the formation of new languages, Urdu chief among them.

Nowadays, Persian is officially the main language in three countries: Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. A decent chunk of Uzbekistan speaks Persian because the Soviets gave Central Asia's two largest and best-known Persian cities, Samarqand and Bukhara, to evil nitwits Uzbekistan instead of the officially-Persian Tajikistan. The language has severely lost its political influence in Asia, where it was the court language in India at one time (as we all know, getting into India is notoriously difficult). Iran was the first major nation to become Muslim (Arabia was peanuts back then), and so the spread of Persian language and culture became part of the spread of Islam early on. Arabic, Turkish, and any other Islamic civilization ended up massively acquiring from Persian language, literature, art, culture, etc. Recent strains of nationalism, however, have lead to groups like the Turks and Arabs attempting to dissociate themselves from Persian and invent non-Persian or anti-Persian national identities. The notoriously racist Turks even went as far as to engage in massive state-enforced language reform to accomplish this. Likewise, I've met Bahraini people who deny that Bahrain was ever part of Iran, an obvious historical fact. Persian will probably never return to its former glory, but it's not like we have an alarming shortage of users.

This video mentions a couple other places where Persian is most frequently found today: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-BB1mDBniA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=55s All the places mentioned were at one time part of Iran.

true,argh523,SWIT,Switzerland,"&gt; I guess, if your daughter had sex with a 20 year old man, you would call it a rape, wouldn't you?

No, because of something I only hinted at earlier. In german, a rape is forced sexual activity (not nessesarily penetration) or ""sexuelle Nötigung"", which is translated with sexual assault, but would better be translated as coercion I think (to put someone under pressure, exploiting a situation etc., without actually physical forcing the act)

The fact that she was ""quite willing"" *and* the guy was apparetly a clueless horny 18 year old does matter. I agree that on paper, this still sounds bad, but it does open the possibility that both parties where attracted to each other in a completly normal way, that the girl was a little more mature than the ""I *love* ponies!""-kind of 13 year old girl one might imagine, and that there are no perverse drives or sinister motives behind the guys actions. And apparetly, this is how the judge, well, judged the situation, which is why he still sentenced him to 9 months in custody, because it's still illegal, but not to a much longer jail sentence\* because that punishment would not fit the crime. I trust the judge did the right thing, because I can easily imagine such a situation. And the suspicus lack of information in the article about the girl supports this\*\*. 

Ok, I feel like I spelled out the obvious enought times now, I'm gonna call it a night. Bye.

\* Since he was sentenced to *youth* custody, he was obviously trialled(?) as a minor. Judges can do that depending on maturity level, on both directions. If he had be trialled as an adult, there would have been a minimum sentence higher than 9 months, in the case of rape usually 3 or 4 years I think (don't know UK). The judge can't just make up whatever sentence he wants. And apparently he thought that would be too harsh of a sentence.

\*\*I mean, they titled the article ""spared from jail"" when in fact he was sentenced, they call it rape without specifying the girl was actually willing, and make a big deal about his upbringing when that didn't seem to be of much importance to the case (only in the way that his current ""maturity level"" might be related to that, but does in no way seem to be the motivation behind the act. I mean, seriously, how is what this guy *has been thought* (not nessecarily believes) of much relevance when he clearly didn't listen to the teachings. After all, he did just have sex before marriage, wich is clearly against the teachings of a devout muslim, right?)  
They only mention those things in the last paragraph of the article, so when a newspaper does that, I'm going to be sceptic and assume the things they *didn't* tell you about might not be so supportive of their case.

true,hughk,EURO,European Union,"&gt;1. To what extent does the European sovereign debt crisis reveal the failings of the European welfare state model and to what extent does it reveal the breakdown of European integration?

Nothing really to do with welfare states more to do with an imbalance between what governments spend and what they collect, particularly in the southern parts of Europe. Further integration is needed to provide better controls and to give confidence for capital flows. It is beginning to happen. Not in the direction that the US has taken but it looks much more positive now.

&gt;2. How much can the U.S. insulate itself from the consequences of Europe's sovereign debt crisis and to what extent should the U.S. government agree to work with European allies to find a solution?

It is in everyone's interest that there is stability. It should be noted that already the ECB is implicitly guaranteeing the Eurozone countries so they are unlikely to fail hard. There will be headaches though. As for US working with Europe, well it seems that certain US Banks may have worked with candidate countries to overstate their ability to meet the entry-criteria.

&gt;3. Should U.S. banking regulators discourage American banks and money market funds from investing in Europe (to limit exposure to potential losses on European investments)?

No but they must  insist that institutions practice proper due diligence, so that the level of investment is always related to the possibility of default.

&gt;4. Should the U.S. government encourage its European allies to hold together the single European currency or should it encourage failing countries like Greece to leave the euro?

The US needs stable partners. Whilst it is feasible for Greece to remain in the Euro, they should do so. The exit of Greece would not be just painful for Greece, but also for its trading partners (incl. the US).

5. Should the IMF use its resources- including U.S.capital subscriptions - to bail out rich European countries, or should IMF assistance be limited to technical advice and guidance?

Why not, all EU countries are IMF contributors? Again, it should be noted that the financial failure in a well connected bank is potentially a problem for other well-connected institutions in other countries such as the US.

&gt;6. Should the Federal Reserve provide access to liquidity in dollars for European banks operating in the U.S. and for European central banks operating in Europe?

For example, Deutsche Bank in the US is a US registered company. it started by acquiring Bankers Trust, a US Investment Bank. All banks in the US are run through US companies. Not to accept the US operation of Deutsche as any other US entity would create a bad precedent. However the extent of any bailout should be ring-fenced to the US operation.
 
&gt;7. Should the U.S. withdraw the U.S. from global capital markets or work more closely with allies in Europe and elsewhere to draft new rules and regulations to make global markets more stable?

No, the US should not disengage itself from Global Capital Markets but it should work with responsible partners such as the EU to raise regulatory standards and to make them enforceable. This already happened with anti-money laundering measures.

true,SamEmbleton,null,null,"**TL;DR: The article is wrong, wrong, wrong. 'Traditional' sovereignty has never existed, so we can't kiss it goodbye. The reason he suggests we kiss it goodbye is the Drone War, enabled by the 'bleeding-heart' doctrine of 'Responsibility to Protect', which he claims is the precedent that justifies the routine assassination of US and non-US citizens with no judicial oversight. This is wrong, R2P is limited consistently to humanitarian crises, not threats to the state. Instead, the Drone War is a logical extension of the decidedly stone-hearted doctrine of the sovereign right to pre-emptive strikes.**

*Long Enough; Will Read:*

The tone of this article is arrogant and churlish in the supreme. I really think any article with the words ""bleeding-heart"" should be automatically disregarded as lacking any sensible content.

That in itself isn't enough of a good response, however, and probably goes against subreddit rules. So let me just take issue with the first couple of paragraphs, which underpin the whole article.

Sovereignty is a myth. Firstly in that it's a legal and social construct and thus liable to change with the needs of populations. But more importantly, the ""fact"" of Westphalian sovereignty, articulated in this article primarily through the principle of the right of non-intervention has literally never, ever been real. It's a lawyer's fantasy.

Let me just make a couple of points: (1) Westphalia's significance was basically hijacked by anti-Hapsburg propagandists much later after the event; (2) intervention and interference are more often the norm than not; (3) the doctrine of sovereignty as a privilege is neither new nor is it the predicate for the drone war.

**1 - Westphalia**

Westphalia, for those not in the know, is the name given to a couple of functionally identical peace treaties that ended the Thirty Years War, which was essentially a pan-European war centred in the Holy Roman Empire (now mostly Germany). It was essentially caused by [The Defenestration of Prague](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration_of_Prague) and provoked a panic among the Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperor (HRE).

The incident split the Empire, which can be loosely characterised as an asymmetric confederation of European states (the EU is the closest modern-day cognate). The split was initially largely along religious lines but soon opportunistic states (like France, England and others) weighed in on one, the other, or both sides of the conflict. Everyone got a look in, trying to further their ambitions -- which is why the war went on for about 30 years.

Here, most accounts -- including Wikipedia -- will tell you that the treaty affirmed the *sovereignty* of the little European States in the HRE and made the Emperor mostly a pathetic figurehead waiting for history to sweep him aside. 

Apparently, the Emperor, his family, and his allies, who also ruled Spain and vast parts of the New World, were fighting for ""universalism"", or the subjugation of all Christendom under the spiritual authority of the Pope and the temporal authority of the Emperor. The other side, Protestant Reformers, were fighting for *sovereignty* -- aptly understood as the right to self-government.

Once the treaty was signed, this cod history goes, the underlying principles of International Relations 101 was sealed in stone and functioned intact until basically the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the bleeding-heart liberals with their lamestream media ruined it all for everyone.

From my irreverent tone, you will have surmised that I believe this account to be false. There are a *lot* of things wrong with this history, most of which I don't know, some of which I do, but I think it's enough to say that for a supposedly revolutionary treaty, most of the participants thought they were being reactionary -- they understood the process to be *restorative*. I'd link it up to some quotes, but they're all in a slightly unreadable English from the period. But suffice it to say that they weren't claiming their right to sovereign equality as it were but were instead claiming what is called *Landeshoheit*.

On the first point, one of their delegations complained to the organisers of the Peace Treaty that they were sent in after an 'inferior' state. When told that would imply they saw themselves as equal to France (second-order), they simpered that they would *never* presume themselves to be equal to the French, who were Kings by title, just they thought they were slightly above the pecking order than the other lot. Compare that to, say, the Olympics, where no country is shown precedence except the host. Or the EU Council, where each country has the right to send its Head of State.

On the second, it's simply an obscure term referring to one's ancient right to exercise authority in a place. Not all Landeshoheits are created equal, so some 'competences' would be in the hands of some states but in the Empire's otherwise. It simply conflicts with the idea of sovereignty which is by nature exercised equally according to the myth.

**(2) - Intervention is the norm**

I don't really need to say much on this but look at the pressure that China puts on North Korea, or the US on Britain in Suez, or Germany on Greece. I have honestly never heard of a time in history when states weren't interfering with one another like an international relations boarding school.

Until fairly recently, it was common for states to invade each other to settle debts. Nor is humanitarian intervention really all that new, many colonialists believed they were intervening in another people's affairs to civilise them -- with all the unhumanitarian consequences it entailed. Nevertheless, it was in some cases motivated by Western notions of what it meant to be humane.

**(3) - Responsibility to Protect is not the legal basis for drones**

R2P is actually a very tightly defined doctrine. It's very much a cornerstone of humanitarian interventionism. Basically, as the author says, it's the notion that states' sovereignty is conditional on being able to protect its people. The definition of protection is *very* tight. It's got to be a humanitarian emergency and intervention must be proportional. It's essentially there just to say that if your state has failed or is committing genocide, then the international community has a positive duty to come to the rescue of the people.

Being a harbour for terrorists isn't on its own evidence of failure, nor is it a necessary consequence of R2P. There's nothing arbitrary about the restriction of R2P to humanitarian crises -- as in it's not a slippery slope thing. Otherwise the absurdity would be that every time someone is murdered it would be a failure of the state to protect the person and the international community must invade. It'd be nonsense.

The actual justification comes from the notion of the right of self-defence, which was subtly changed under Bush. The legality of pre-emptive strikes has been a constant -- you needn't wait for them to bomb you to bomb them to prevent damage. While this is all fully endorsed by the author, he fails to see that it is actually this 'traditional' bit of sovereignty to blame for the Drone War, not us bleeding-heart types who put people before polities, because we see that the latter is purely a fiction for the benefit of the former.

The Bush administration's position on this was simple: we won't just strike to destroy known, imminent threats. We will strike to prevent those threats becoming imminent, or even material -- which *is* a new norm.

This norm is somewhat justified superficially, given that threats aren't really state-based anymore but new technology has given the Bush/Obama administrations great licence to essentially assassinate anyone they choose at will, with very little in the way of due process.

But R2P has nothing in there that inherently leads us to that conclusion that failure in states is defined as harbouring threats to another state. That's plain old Hobbesian state-as-guarantor-of-safety jazzed up with remote-control killing machines.",0,1361131908,null,0,false,0,c8gsqxx,t3_18p6ue,t1_c8gsqxx,t3_18p6ue,null,1431321570,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Of course there are German dialects which are heavy for me to understand (Plattdeutsch is more Dutch than German IMO, some guys in Oberbayern are as fucked up as our Tiroleans etc.), but since we all learn Standard in school we all should be able to hold a conversation in it. Of course unknown dialect words will lead to some confusion, but everybody who is educated enough to speak English fluently should know the ""real"" word for it or, if there isn't a real translation to Standard German, be able to explain it shortly.

**Visas and employment**

I don't want to bring down your awesome plans, and if you want to move to Barcelona, you should absolutely live in this wonderful place, but it is far from sensible. Others mentioned the unemployment rate (25%), and think about it: these 25% mostly speak outstanding Catalan and Spanish and they have the right to work in Spain already. You, on the other hand, fail both of these essential requirements. Spanish is your lesser worry, I'm sure you will pick it up quickly with the right choice of a language school and constant practice you will get once you get off the tourist trail (it's totally fine to step on it initially, of course!). Your biggest obstacle is getting a work permit. If you are able to find a job that fits your education and doesn't require language skills, the employer will have to file an application for the work permit for you, which is not easy for them and not many companies will take the trouble to do it, since they can probably hire a local or at least someone with a EU passport to do the same job. Unfortunately, you CANNOT apply for just a generic sort of work visa and then start looking for a job, the application needs to be tied to a job offer which you currently do not have. I suggest you look at your network in Canada and see if you can be hired by a company with an office in Barcelona. It's a stretch, but you never know...

**Accommodation**

You shouldn't worry about nice restaurants and pubs, most neighbourhoods have those, and if you can't find any, you haven't been looking hard enough. Trust me. Regarding the beach requirement, public transit in Barcelona is outstanding, and you can get to the beach by metro or bus quite quickly. Dogs are not allowed on beaches anyway, so you won't be needing the proximity to walk your pet there. Large terrace/patio is not too hard to find, even in Gràcia, which is so popular with expats you can't spit without hitting someone who speaks English (I'm kidding :)). However, with all your requirements in mind, I'd suggest renting in Poblenou. I may be biased here, since it's one of my favourite areas of the city, but it has the beach, the restaurants, it's slightly quieter than the central neighbourhoods of Barcelona, has this nice *barrio barrio* feel, and yet it's only 10-15 mins away by metro from the Gothic quarter, Born and Gràcia. Poblenou is also a newer area and it's easier to find flats that are not too dark and too small there. I work with real estate in Barcelona, and the only apartments that spring to mind, with great patios and such, I rented out in Poblenou :)

**Pet-friendly**
I have just one more bit of info you may find relevant: pets, with an exception of service dogs, are not allowed on metro or buses, unless they are in a hard-case pet container, which is not really good news for your black lab.

German, Spanish, and Greek are cool too. 

I despise French (which sucks as a Canadian who had no choice but to learn it). I'm not a big fan of Italian either. 

To me, words in Romance languages generally don't sound like what they mean, like they paint over the essence of core concepts with their own rigid style. It's just the way my mind interprets them, I guess, since they have a much more limited supply of phonemes compared to English and sounds are constantly repeated and dropped. Some people like that fluidity but I don't since words kind of lose their individual power. (And to what end, so that every sentence sounds like every other sentence? How boring. It's like lazy poetry! Aesthetically other languages are much more dynamic, imo)  

And as an English speaker I value conciseness. French is just so damn verbose, even in simple everyday use! It's not uncommon for me to see translations that use more than twice as many words for a few simple sentences (and I understand it so I can recognize if something is added or lost in translation). And French constantly bounces between nasal, guttural, and pursed lipped sounds. Everything about it seems so unnatural and strict to my senses so it often sounds pompous and slightly exhausting. My experience with it can basically be summed up as ""familiarity breeds contempt."" Unfortunate but c'est la vie I guess.  

I don't mind Spanish as much because 1) the vowels sound natural, 2) it's phonetic and consistent, 3) the extra dimension of Arabic influence, 4) its huge presence in the Americas, and 5) I didn't grow up with it. Essentially it's exotic yet palatable and rich so I can overlook aspects of it I don't love. Italian seems too bound and defined by its cultural insularity, and French by its awkward preservationist constructions and inability to resolve non-standard spoken dialects with its proper written form.

&gt;&gt; liberty, security, secularism etc all oppose each other

&gt; Never thought about it that way. We generally feel that they all work to enhance each other, instead of opposing each other. Don't you think all three are possible at the same time?

These principles are more like a goal, a guideline than an actual thing. You can never have absolute freedom/no freedom at all, or absolute security, you can only have a certain degree of freedom and security, be it low or high. Now yes, they can coexist to an extent, but if you want as much security or secularism as possible, you'll necesarily limit freedom and vice versa.  
It is also worth highlighting that in a lot of situations, absolute freedom cancels itself, because when there are no laws, the default law applies: natural selection. 

&gt; Regarding secularism: do government officials need to be secular?

Not sure what you mean by that. They can be religious and they can talk about it as much as they want, even though they probably won't be very popular if they choose to do so. 

&gt; I see. But would it be safe to assume that one would be allowed to wear, lets say, scientific equations or quotes from Charles Darwin's One The Origin of Species, or maybe even a quote criticizing religion (possibly from Christopher Hitchens' God Is Not Great)?

""We are all african apes"" is as fine as ""I don't come from no stinkin' monkey"". ""Religion is bad for ye"" and the likes wouldn't cause too much trouble I guess.  
""Catholics are untermenschen"" or ""fuck muslims"" would fall under incitation to hatred. 

*However*, this is just the law. I'm not sure if it is prevalent in the states, but having your opinions written on your shirt is flat-out shameful for teenagers here (I was one not long ago) and it's even worse as an adult. The price you have to pay for wearing any of the above in public isn't a fine, but a social segregation. That's just a private thing nobody wants to talk about. 

&gt; Personally, do you think this law is good for integration or do you think it will lead to (further?) fragmentation of the French society along religious lines? Do you personally think this law will be a hinderance to foreign investors or entrepreneurs? As a Sikh, I constantly hear about this law by other Sikhs around the world... but is this law considered controversial by the French (do you see frequent protests, media coverage, etc)?

Everyone made a fuss about the last law but it isn't actually about religion, it's about covering your face entirely in public places. It was already forbidden to wear the kind of turban you wear in schools before, and enforced. I clearly remember being explained that when I was in middle school, and it was in the late 90's.  
About that already existing law, I think it's an excellent thing, and I'm pretty sure that our politic of secular assimilation is one of the few things that isn't controversial from the far left to the far right.

These issues always happen when you're learning the language and how to translate it.

I've used english from age 7 or so, and I always thought it was neat and tidy. When I started studying swedish, it always felt cumbersome compared to english. But as I progressed, I discovered certain traits that made it easier to express certain ideas in swedish.

Because you're awesome, that's why :D

More seriously though (and note that I like Castillian and this is all a personal preference thing) Portuguese and Spanish are quite mutually understandable when they are written/read, but there is a *huge* difference in terms of phonetics, mainly due to the number of vowel sounds, etc. Portuguese is sound-wise closer to Catalan and - from what I keep hearing - Russian than to Spanish, which is in turn closer to Greek for most people. Actually, some of the way we treat the vowels and the speed of it is not unlike Dutch - perhaps this influences your preference?

What I've read on the subject seems to attribute the differences mainly on the substract: Castillian is heavily influenced by Basque, whereas Gallician-Portuguese follows French in inheriting the sonority of Celtic-ish tribes. Note that I'm talking merely of the language, not anything else.

Why Hof? It reeks, it has one of the highest unemployment rates in Bavaria and after 2200 they pull up the curbs.

For a place take a look at: http://www.wg-gesucht.de/wg-zimmer-in-Hof.234.0.0.0.html even if your not looking for a wg, there are quite often nice rentals.

Hof has a Uni, so with some luck somebody will be looking for a new tenant.

Pretty good and affordable theater.

Two kinos, ""clubs"" , dozens of shops, bars, restaurants and cafes around Altstadt and Lorenzstreet.


The HofBad is nice and there is or was a paintball hall.

I love Italian because it sounds like music and there are many elegant ways of expressing beautiful things in it, but I barely speak it. 

I dislike French because I had to learn it in school and never had any use for it. It’s unnecessarily complicated in writing and I have a hard time understanding native speakers if they come from the wrong corner of the country. Sorry, guys.

Hungarian and Finnish both sound very melancholic and I keep hearing all the time that Hungarian (maybe Finnish too?) is a very unique and logical language. Therefore I’d love to learn the basics but it’s hard to find a place teaching it where I live.

Swedish has some really cute words in it („bil“ for automoBILe) and the grammar - like the article as a suffix of the noun - is interesting. I can read quite a bit of Swedish although I cannot speak or understand a word because the pronounciation is very different to German even though the words are not.

Yiddish is very cool, funny and almost like a German „mundart“ (dialect). Unless they write it in Hebrew.

Icelandic seems to be very „pure“ - free from foreign words and almost the same like it was 1000 years ago. The pronounciation is beyond crazy though.

I wouldn't scoff at that! Irish is one of the nicest accents in English. In the scale of nice accents it goes some thing like a mix of (nice) Scottish, Irish, south British, Australian and Canadian. Those are the good ones you want. And German accents tend to sound pretty nice to English ears anyway (at least in the UK). So long as you don't pick up the North English accents, Glaswegian or *god forbid an American accent* you'll sound nice. RP is overated and really hard to achieve.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_mafia

&gt;The Albanian mafia or Albanian organized crime (Albanian: Mafia Shqiptare) is the general terms used for criminal organizations based in Albania or composed of ethnic Albanians. **Albanian organized crime is active in Albania, the United States, and the European Union (EU) countries**, participating in a diverse range of criminal enterprises including drug trafficking and arms trafficking. **In Albania alone, there are over 15 mafia families** that control organized crime. According to Wikileaks reports, the Albanian mafia has monopolized various international affiliations from as far east as Israel, to as far west as South America. These reports primarily indicate a strong connection between politicians and various Albanian mafia families. According to the Research Institute for European and American Studies, or RIEAS, Albanian Mafia groups are actually hybrid organizations (various sectors of society), **often involved in both criminal and political activities**.[1]

In this light it seems like the politicians and Nato is also involved in this criminal activity. It would be nice to find out what Albanian troops bring to Europe from Afghanistan in those US Air Force cargo planes...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Battalion_%28Albania%29

&gt;In July 2010, a detachment of 44 men (codenamed EAGLE 1) from the BOS was deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan. Differently from the rest of previous Albanian contingents, this unit was directly involved in combat operations. It is believed that the unit **worked closely with US military intelligence** and was responsible for deep reconnaissance behind Taliban lines as well as intelligence collection on High-value targets.

That pork thing is very true. It's a call-card or a ""signature"". You see, when they rob a house, they usually know that the family is out of the country etc. When they left that piece of meat to rotten on the floor, it makes the whole apartment smell like death. And that smell and flies will destroy the apartment, you can't live there without doing a massive, costly wall, painting, carpeting etc. work.
There are rules in robbery i.e. Russian mafia. But not in albanian mafia. And I don't get it, how could those people get a Nato status? Did they bribe? Was there any threats? And who wants to join Nato, when they a covering up a nation like that?

fuck albanian mafia.

Copy-pasted:

Distinction (Spanish: distinción) refers to the differentiated pronunciation of the two Spanish phonemes written ⟨s⟩ and ⟨z⟩ or ⟨c⟩ (only before ⟨e⟩ or ⟨i⟩, the so-called ""soft"" ⟨c⟩):
⟨s⟩ represents a voiceless alveolar fricative /s/ (either laminal as in English, or apical);
⟨z⟩ and soft ⟨c⟩ represent a voiceless interdental fricative /θ/ (the ⟨th⟩ in think).
This pronunciation is the standard on which Spanish orthography was based, and it is universal in Central and Northern parts of Spain, except for some bilingual speakers of Catalan and Basque, according to Hualde (2005).

In many other Spanish-speaking regions and countries, however, the phonemic distinction between /s/ and /θ/ has been neutralized or merged:

* Ceceo is a phenomenon found in a few dialects of southern Spain in which the historical phonemes /s/ and /θ/ are both realized as [θ]. 
* Seseo is the merger in the opposite direction: the original phonemes /s/ and /θ/ are both pronounced as [s]. Seseo is the most widespread pronunciation among Spanish speakers worldwide.

Tl;dr: there are three variants: distinction, with [θ] and [s], which is the orthographic standard and the pronunciation in Northern/Central Spain; ceceo (only [θ]), found in rural areas of Southern Spain and some part of Central America; seseo (only [s]), found in Southern Spain and widespread in Latin America. And none of them is a speech impairment. ",0,1361147430,null,0,false,0,c8gx45p,t3_18ou5l,t1_c8gx45p,t1_c8gswr9,null,1431323711,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Also, I believe there is an application deadline of April 1 for students wishing to attend a course starting in the fall. Check with the French consulate or embassy closest to you to be sure.

If you *know* you're heading to Paris in the summer, get the process started now, and you might get lucky and have you visa in hand before you go for the summer. BUT, I'm pretty certain you need to already be accepted to a particular program before you can apply for a visa.

Indeed, and you have had several opportunities to explain why you can arbitrarily categorise foods into 'ok' and 'not ok' and somehow no one else can. Its moral to eat horse because you personally don't think it's any different to beef. 

&gt;The criteria are not entirely subjective insofar as a potato had neither sensations nor emotions.

The decision that sense and emotion are worth considering is entirely subjective. There's nothing out there that says something with a nervous system is better than something without, that's merely your personal opinion. 

&gt;On a molecular/atomar level we are all equivalent. My argument was that those that are outraged by the killing of one animal ought to be outraged by the killing of another.

Which is ridiculous as I've been fruitlessly trying to explain to you. You draw the line and say all animals are equivalent to each other and each possess the same moral properties. You've given no objective reason why you draw the line at the kingdom level (animalia) and not say the domain or phylum level nor why we cannot say all life is equivalent and if it isn't then there is no reason why all members of the kingdom animalia are. Oh except humans for yet another unexplained reason. 

Indeed if you believe there is no moral difference between eating different animals but also refuse to eat humans because its immoral..... well there is a word for that.

This is a very insightful comment. Globalization has changed the world a great deal in the past twenty years. Europe in particular has witnessed it to the greatest degree. The continent, once split into two ideological camps has slowly been unifying. A developed and rich continent with so many small countries is bound to represent globalization better than any other.

true,le_butthurt,UKGB,United Kingdom,"As canard_glasgow says, the British Empire mentality hasn't really gone away. We think we're awesome but we aren't allowed to say that.

In fairness, we have had a rather significant impact on the world's history and development. Evolutionary theory is attributed to an Englishman and his contemporaries are considered historical appendages to his greatness, calculus was worked out/discovered by and Englishman as were the basic foundations of modern physics, banking and stock markets were arguably invented by a Scotsman, university education has some of it's oldest roots here, the abolition of the slave trade was furthered drastically by an Englishman. The Magna Carta (which I think translates to Big Map), *Habeas corpus*. I could go on. Basically this impacts the national psyche by making us think that the world should listen to us. 

Also, the part we played in the two world wars (and the fact that we won) imprints the mind with the idea that we are unequivocally correct in all our views.

We don't learn about the things we got wrong, like how we, along with other imperialist powers, screwed Africa royally in the days of conquest; we don't talk much about the American War of Independence; we'd rather teach our kids about Churchill than Edward VIII. We spend more time talking about the Nazi's than we do the fact that our Royal Bloodline has a good amount of Germanic blood in it. It's pretty one sided. As a result, we think we're never wrong and always right.

We do, of course, have a huge problem with the Class System. We can't escape it. We need it. It's how we identify ourselves. In my own generation (I'm late 20s), people would rather downplay their middle class upbringing and call themselves Working Class. I don't understand why. It might have something to do with our rejection of money (or at least the crime of having more of it than the next guy), it might be because by painting oneself as the underdog we suddenly approve more of our own lifestyle.  
Where does our obsession with the Class System originate? Probably the fact that we have a monarchy. Whether we think about it or not, we can never become our own Head of State. That and, given the nation's history as being somewhat wealthy, there is a lot of Old Money, which obviously perpetuates the issue. There has always been, and perhaps always will be, a constant struggle between the haves and the have-nots.

As for the Islander mentality, it's always been there. A long time ago we told the Continent, 'Shove it; we'll have our own Church.' It's never gone away, either.

The fact that our history is so old and convoluted probably explains why we're so liberal. We tend to be more liberal than other countries I've been to and don't like nationalism (at least not overtly). Our own brand of nationalism is one of a subtle arrogance that goes primarily undetected. Pride in one's country is an absolute necessity yet vehemently rejected--which explains why the Olympics was such a confusing experience for so many people: national pride was suddenly allowed in public spaces.

true,blorg,EURO,Ireland,"The Basques in Spain have a serious secession movement, as do the Catalans. The Basques and Catalans in France don't, at all; the character of the nationalism/regionalism there is cultural, not political.

The only serious secession movement in France is Corsica, but it is still a minority and with France as one of the most centralised and unitary states in Europe with a long history of trying to stamp out non-French regional identities I don't see a change in Corsica's political status any time soon.

The secession (or more accurately, reuinification) movement in Northern Ireland is far far stronger than either the Basque or Catalan one in France and doesn't deserve to be grouped with them. The movements have had far greater support and Northern Ireland has achieved substantially greater autonomy than either region in France.

At the same time I don't see Irish reunification happening in my lifetime. Independence in Scotland actually has significantly more support, although I don't expect that to pass either, there just isn't enough support for it and the Conservatives will pull no punches in running the dirtiest of dirty FUD-ridden campaigns against it, just like they did with voting reform. In fact, they have already started.

Only this time they will also have the support of the other two major UK parties, Labour and the Lib Dems, who between them have almost half the vote in Scotland. These parties, and Labour in particular, *need* Scotland to remain in the UK to have any hope of attaining a majority in Westminster. Scotland leaves and as England is solidly Conservative the rUK parliament will be dominated by them for decades. So Labour also has a strong incentive this time to fight it.

On the other hand, the only people who actually want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK are the people in NI. Strong majorities in both Ireland and Britain support Irish reunification. Labour has been explicitly committed to reunification since the 1980s and all UK parties now take a neutral line supporting reunification in the case that a majority there desires it.

The UK-wide political parties simply don't exist in NI so there is no strong incentive to any of them to hang on to it for seats in Westminster. Although absolutely tiny (about 3% of the UK population) historically it has been nothing but a troublesome place which has been a massive drag on the UK treasury. 

Currently however even a majority of nationalist voters in NI don't actually want to leave the UK. This is of course related to Ireland being in the absolute shit at the moment but it is a mistake to think that all Catholics actually want out of the UK; many (and indeed currently, most) are actually perfectly happy with an end to decades of discrimination and fair representation in an autonomous government while remaining within the UK. Which is what they finally have, right now.

So although the long feared 'demographic threat' is actually [coming true in Northern Ireland right now,](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/northern-ireland-report-statistically-the-future-is-catholic-and-female-28720110.html) with Catholics set to [make up an overall majority of the population as soon as 2016](http://namawinelake.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/what-happens-in-2016-when-northern-irelands-catholics-are-on-a-par-with-protestants/) it would be a mistake to conclude that this will result in reunification in the near term. It won't.

For most of the seccessionist groups in the EU increased autonomy is an acceptable compromise, and that is what I expect will also happen with both Scotland and Catalonia. Scotland because although they *are* having a binding referendum the people won't vote for independence, Catalonia because Madrid will do absolutely everything and anything in its power to prevent asking them the question.",0,1361186926,null,0,1361187715,0,c8h5qg2,t3_18q8pi,t1_c8h5qg2,t1_c8h2eh2,null,1431327824,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Price-wise I'm certain you will have many options among concertada and private schools in the 3-6k range per child/year and I would recommend avoiding public schools if you can afford to do so.

 Not all public schools are dismal, but you have better choices and more control/involvement in a concertada or private with the only drawback being the price. And nor should you feel that a concertada or private school will isolate your children in some ivory tower, a large percentage of students attend concertada/private schools and only the most posh international schools or conservative Opus dei schools are considered to be outside of a normal schooling experience.

You say that like it's a bad thing.

In the cases in which capitalism does not function it makes no sense to attempt to apply any sort of ""partial capitalism"" because the risk of failure is the primary corrective mechanism in capitalism and the absence of failure can only lead to cancerous growth of mismanaged or overmanaged and, thus, costly institutions.

You triggered my curiosity and so I did some research. [This map](http://imgur.com/NNZNgRr)(sorry for the bad quality) illustrates what everyone is talking about.

As you can see, there are different parts of Baden-Württemberg apart from just being Baden and Württemberg. I grew up in ""Süd-Mittelschwaben"" (Leutkirch). Everyone outside this wine red area of Süd-Mittelschwaben is (*for us*) a ""Badenser"". Unfortunately, Riedlingen is also north of that line. Although Ost-, Mittel- and Westschwaben are not in Baden, we despise their dialect (which differs quite a lot from ours) and thus also call them Badenser (as an offense).

The yellow parts are actually Baden and since Franken (blueish) is out of sight anyways we call that Baden too.

I'm a bit sad about it. I think it's a good idea that people should give a year in service to their society, of course women should have been included.

No on both accounts because a) virtually nobody really cared which of those two you actually did and b) Zivis got payed more - because the military gives you food, a bed and health care, but most people lived at home at that time anyway so Zivis had more money in the pocket. So it would have been advantageous for poor people to do civil service.

&gt;Or, is the opposite true? Did the program serve to bring young people together through a shared experience of civilian service?

Not really, most Zivis didn't have much contact to other Zivis, it really was more like an underpaid job instead of some grand experience.

In the beginning it was much more difficult, you had to appear before a kind of trial with military officials and defend your case. Zivildienst was 2-3 times longer than military duty back then, as a form of punishment for not wanting to defend your country as a soldier.

I knew nothing when I moved here, and signed up for a two-week intensive Spanish course as soon as I arrived, mostly to get some basic vocabulary and more importantly to learn how the language works. After that it was a matter of practice and expanding my vocabulary. Same with Catalan, pretty much. I took the classes paid for by the government for about a month and then it was just practice. Both languages have a similar structure so the basics you learn in a Spanish class will help you when you go to learn Catalan.

It helps that I am married to a Catalan and we speak Catalan and Spanish at home (he doesn't speak much English). Also watching foreign series on TV here with the original soundtrack but Spanish or Catalan subtitles is a great way to improve your vocabulary.

I'd recommend you pick up a copy of Barcelona by Robert Hughes (**not** the confusingly-titled Barcelona the Great Enchantress by the same author) before you come. It's probably the definitive English-language history of Catalunya, a fascinating read (for a history book), and will give you a great deal of understanding into the issues surrounding the language and the politics that accompany it.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"A lot of countries don't learn about their nation's 'bad bits', and tbh I think Britain is relatively progressive in that. I learned about Empire. I learned that it had good aspects to it, and did some fundamental good to the world. However, I learned about the terrible bits. Massacres such as Amritsar, forcing our culture and religion upon people because ""they were savages that needed modernising"". I learned about the poor handling of decolonisation in different countries, and how prior to this we exploited their economy to bolster our own after the world wars.

Everything you say about the class system is perfect. That's the biggest divider in British society. Our politics is still based on it. The Conservative Party still work to redefine 'Tory' and Labour still call them 'Tories' in a derogatory manner whenever they announce a policy that might hurt the working class ('same old Tories'). The concept of a Christian Democratic Union ala Germany is absolutely foreign to me. For us its rich vote one way, poor another.

Yet our class system is also part of the positive identity of being British. We know people see us as the nation with the Queen. Other nations have royalty, ours is undoubtedly the most famous. I bet our country creates more income for non-Brits doing 'royal tourism' than any other nation.

With regards to other nations what you say about the Island mentality is correct. I think it works two ways though. We see ourselves as being European, but not quite like 'the Continentals'. That such a term exists implies Britain not only sees itself as different, but also that it sees Europeans as much more similar. That same Islander mentality also gave us our Navy though, and in terms of Armed Forces that was our pride and joy for centuries. Check [Rule, Britannia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule,_Britannia!) for more information.

One thing you did overlook though, its the American Revolutionary War. We were the ruler, they revolted (in British eyes of course, USA obviously sees it differently). Similarly, India was granted independence, it did not win it. However, an inquiry into the historiography of other colonial powers would reveal similar traits.

Per quanto mi riguardava, il corso di studi delle scuole superiori era IRRILEVANTE con la scelta della facoltà:
Non dico che se hai fatto ragioneria allora ti tocca far economia e cose simili ma, ovviamente, sei leggermente avvantaggiato grazie alle conoscenze apprese nei 5 anni.

Devi poi guardare le tue inclinazioni personali: per esempio..per quanto mi piaccia smanettarr amatorialmente sul calcolatore, mi rendo conto che fisica e matematica per me sono dei deal-breaker.

Devi considerare, forse con minor peso, i tuoi ambiti di spicco, per esempio: ho avuto la fortuna di crearmi un ottimo bagaglio linguistico per quanto riguarda la lingua inglese ma..ció non significa che debba andare a far lingue. Hai solo un valido strumento in più da utilizzare.

In my experience the people who wouldn't have outright volunteered for a similar job but were forced into one through the civil service found it very worthwile and rewarding. In a society that's getting more and more divided every day, Zivildienst provided people with an insight into an area of society they wouldn't normally get. It also helps developing important social skills, the lack of which companies forced to hire 22year-old university graduates often lament. 

As for the financial side of things, I was always under the impression that most of the work being done during the Zivildienst was unskilled labour anyway and it wasn't so much a matter of taking away jobs from regular workers but young people performing simple tasks that their employers wouldn't be able to pay for  otherwise. And I have a feeling that the people who were too egoistic to sacrifice 9 months of their lives to give something back to society wouldn't be the first to voluntarily pay higher taxes so all those places without Zivildienstleistende could hire skilled workers instead.

Waste of money. When I had to do this years ago it was a 13 months ordeal.

I spent 6 months or so working as a pre-university programmer, so it wasn't all wasted, but a lot of people didn't have that option.

No, I don't think so. Mostly it was a question of how well you function within an authoritarian system like the military and whether you could accept an extra month of duty.

&gt; Or, is the opposite true? Did the program serve to bring young people together through a shared experience of civilian service?

This would be more true for some than for others. I didn't get much out of it, but there are people who defended Zivildienst on these grounds. If I had to guess, I'd say for most it was just a weird little detour before the actual real life begins.

true,Rotze,null,null,"&gt;Do you think the Zivildienst was a force for good in German society or a waste of money?

I don't really know what you mean by ""force for good"", Zivildienst nonetheless was an important part of the German social system for a very long time. Waste of money would imply that there was money lost and there is more than one perspective on that. While the state may have invested money in the people doing Zivildienst, I don't think that money was ""lost"" and without being able to prove it on solid facts I'm pretty sure that any person doing their military service cost the state a solid bunch of more money than a person doing Zivildienst. Another perspective on this is from the point of view of the institutions that employed Zivildienstleistende. They definitely did not lose any money, instead they saved a huge amount of money by employing people that they didn't have to pay the same amount of money that a ""normal"" qualified worker would have earned.

On an individual level, Zivildienst/voluntary service can be something amazing. Especially in a time where everything gets faster, people are coming out of school earlier and are thrown into work or further education much earlier than before, Zivildienst can be something like a buffer. It helps young people to get a little more time to ""grow up"" , develop their own personality, get aware of their interests and help them mature. This may deflect somehow of the fact that society and politics desperately needs to rethink it's core values and developments that make everything faster but as this doesn't happen, I guess Zivildienst can be very helpful for young people's growing up process.

Furthermore it may help to develop some basic social skills like compassion and helpfulness. Supporting people that need to be supported (older people, people with disabilities or illnesses, etc.) is a crucial part of what society has to supply in order to be functional and, let's call it humane.

&gt;How do you feel about the termination of the Zivildienst?

You have to make clear that there was no ""termination of the Zivildienst"", rather than an intermission in the practice of the compulsory military service. By absolving your Zivildienst, on an official level you fulfilled your duty to go to the military. 

I feel that this duty should have been cancelled a long time ago and the practice to have people justify their motifs of not wanting to go to the military (instead of letting them choose freely for example) is absolutely wrong, because it's (at least in my opinion) against some basic points of the German constitutional law. 

Also it helped to fortify a point of view that let Zivildienst be seen as something 'worth less' or something 'lower' than the actual military duty. What's also happened is that suddenly institutions that employed Zivildienstleistende started to panic because they realized that they were dependant on those cheap workers. In fields of social work and medical care, in which most Zivis were employed, it is crucial that the people employed are highly educated. What the practice of Zivildienst did was to avoid that, leaving Germany in a situation where it is in desperate need of workers in social and care fields but at the same time has nobody wanting to do them because they're paid poorly and are sort of looked down upon from society.

So basically I feel good about the ""termination"" because it forces the government to rethink something that should have been rethought and changed a long time ago. For people still wanting to do something like Zivildienst there are still basically the same possibilities that were there before. Zivildienst has not just been terminated but merely replaced by another form of voluntary service.

The experience you get from it varies extremely as the work and the carriers (Caritas, Diakonie, Rotes Kreuz) are not really forced into a standard.

Everyone gets about 370€ a month, which does not exactly put you in a position in which you can live on your own. Note that this is a fraction of the money that you got while being a Zivi while you do the exact same work (for example my job was done by a Zivi before).
The next problem is that your salary is fixed and intended for a 39 hour week, but some jobs, for example in elementary schools, simply can not add up to 39 hours a week, which means that your ""co-BFDlers"" might get 370€ for 20 hours of work.
Especially the work in elementary schools is trivial. Most of the time you just sit there in class and wait for a ADHD-kid to interrupt the flow of the class, get him/her out and wait for her/him to calm down.

On the other hand there are some BFDlers who do varying shifts (even on the weekend) and do at least 39 hours (mind that working more is not compensated). These jobs are often in institutions for the mentally ill or otherwise handicapped people which can be violent at times.

Now, who in their right mind would put 40+ hours (on weekends) for less than 400€ a week (and you still have to pay for fuel and food you consume at work). Since one of the reasons the Zivildienst was bad is because of the lowering of the salaries in social jobs, this is much worse.

My work was stacked with volunteers, for one trained worker there were 2-3 volunteers, who were necessary for the institution to work.

Most people who did a year in the Bundesfreiwilligendienst did it because they did not know what to do with their lives. Some of them did not find a job and the Agentur für Arbeit assigned them to do Bundesfreiwilligendienst, some have not finished school and are just trying to do a quick buck.

People who did it for the purpose of contributing society and helping people in less fortunate positions were extremely rare.

It was different when it was called Freiwilliges soziales Jahr (FSJ) a few years ago. Since you could decide between Zivildienst and a FSJ most people who were in for the money would choose the Zivildienst.

It seems like I just listed cons in here, but there are definitely pros for doing a BFD.

The biggest one is how much you learn from getting a full working experience directly after school. You gain a certain work ethic and responsibility for your acts. However this might not be true for every job, so you have to choose wisely.

The second big pro are the seminars you get. We had about 30 days with activities and BFDlern who had other jobs. I crafted many friendships in these days and learnt a lot.

I actually would do the BFD again if I had to choose. It was a great year for someone in the position I was in. 

If there are any questions left, feel free to ask!
And sorry for my stringy, german-like sentences, I just woke up :)

&gt;Do you think the Zivildienst was a force for good in German society or a waste of money?

Definitely not a waste of money for the employer, since Zivis (short for ""Zivildienstleistende"") did get only a small wage +food/housing if needed. Force for good? I would say so, since it gave cheap labour to places where it was needed. Young people on the other hand had the opportunity to learn to do practical stuff, interacting with handicapped people/elderly, teamwork. Some also did get interested in working in the medical field/nursing which they did not consider before (good friend of mine now is a physician, before his Zivi he did not even consider that possibility and wanted to become a software engineer).

&gt;Do you think it caused a social divide, i.e. young people from lower income backgrounds more inclined to serve in the military for a year whilst the more well off would serve for a year in the Zivildienst?
&gt;Or, is the opposite true? Did the program serve to bring young people together through a shared experience of civilian service?

I would say the latter, since the people I worked with had nothing in common except all were young men from my town.

&gt;How do you feel about the termination of the Zivildienst?

Some say that the organizations that used to employ Zivis now have a hard time getting enough (cheap) labor. But then again the Zivildienst was meant as a replacement for the military service, so it only makes sense to terminate the Zivildienst if the military service is no longer required. Also the fact that only a small part of men was drafted (even when I had to do my Zivi) has to be considered: At the end it was clear to everyone that this was some kind of gamble where the ones with even small handicaps (really bad eyesight, small back problems) were lucky.

I've met all kinds of people during my Zivildienst, most just did their Abitur (~A-Levels) like me, some were already working etc or doing their apprenticeship. From what I've heard though, there were more people with a lower degree going for the army instead of zivi. But it wasn't the Zivildienst/Conscription that caused this disparity, it was only a sign of it.
 
&gt;How do you feel about the termination of the Zivildienst?
 
You know, I actually view it as a thoroughly positive experience, then again, there are people that had much shittier jobs than I did. It greatly influenced my decision of what to do after school and it was the first real glimpse into work, I mean real work, not some student job. It thought me a lot about growing up and especially about getting old (I worked with elderly people a lot). 
 
The only thing I thought (and still think) was shit, was how easy you could get out of it and thus get to college earlier, which I simply found unfair. When I went to my musterung (physical and psychological examination prior to serving) I thought ""if they take me I'll do Zivildienst instead, if not, well then I'm off"", I saw no need to lie, whereas a lot of people/friends simply told bullshit stories or came with a medical certification that their uncles uncle got them, because suddenly they had a bad back/foot/whatever (despite doing A-Levels in PE often...) exempting them from doing military service (and thus Zivildienst). I found that unfair, lazy and cowardly, still think it is.
 
&gt;Do you think the Zivildienst was a force for good in German society or a waste of money?
 
I wouldn't say it was a force for good strictly, but for example the place where I worked got quite a few volunteers through the Zivildienst, mostly in the area of emergency medical care, but still - some of those people would not help out there if it weren't for the Zivildienst.
Many people complain that it held wages down for specialized workers in the social field, I think that's exaggerated.

Because of the nature of the hospital, occasionally (while everything was going smoothly) surgeons would take the time to explain certain aspects of their ongoing procedures to junior doctors and allow me a glance as well. Anaesthetists did so even more often.

On the other hand, other Zivildienst tasks around the hospital included maintenance men, and they probably had a completely different experience throughout the 13 months it was back then. I certainly wouldn't have appreciated that as much.

When you take into account that not everyone was invited to Musterung and out of those who were deemed fit and didn't choose Zivildienst right away, only an unknown percentage were actually called to service, even back then, the overall process wasn't fair.

**Thankfully** it's pretty much legally impossible to force people into something like that in Germany. The only way it could be pulled off in the past (and still can be btw, they just don't for now) was because of special laws surrounding the *military* which was thereby designed to partially consist of non-professionals.

Take away the military roots and focus on a mandatory Zivildienst and you are left with forcing adults into specific labours that someone decided provide ""important social skills"".

I spent my Zivildienst time at a special needs school and it was one of the best times of my life. The people I worked with were awesome and the kids... - it was just so rewarding to dicipher their way of seeing things and learning to properly respond to it!

I spend about a week at a Zivildienst camp where we would exchange our thoughts with others and our supervisor. From what I got there were some people who chose really boring work areas and got nothing out of it, often also not able/willing to put much effort in their time being there. That was the main problem with people who disliked their civil service.

On the other hand people who worked in social areas like me often provided a very positive feedback. During my time I achieved some first experience of actually working and taking responsibility. Also, the work environment was really good. The teachers at the school really appreciated having ""Zivildienstlers"" around to take care of things that would usually interfere with the lesson plan, giving us a certain form of self-valuation, because we knew that we were needed. I gained the knowledge that I could actually work with mentally challenged kids and how rewarding it was. This even changed my plans for the future in terms of career.

All in all, I feel bad that future generations will miss out on this awesome experience **but** if the Zivildienst had continued there should have been more support for people *before* their 9 months of civil service. Everyone should have been made more aware of what certain work areas can offer them and what their expected input would be.

One is that it's obviously kind of forced labor. It makes you waste time on a low income job that you could better spend on education or real work. It's also extremely cheap for employers, which means that other workers can't compete. In my mind, out of these two issues, the second aspect is the bigger problem. 

On the other hand, I've known *several* people who benefitted greatly from doing Zivieldienst. When you're done with school, move out of your parents' house, enroll in a university, and suddenly have to structure your own live and do all the things you never had to do before, that can be a lot to handle. Zivieldienst can be a bridge here that allows young people to learn some of the realities of life and gives them some room for growth before they take on their next challenges.

I can't see a real difference in giving money to producers (=farmers) on the one side and reducing costs (=import taxes) for companies on the other side. What do you mean by saying this would be different? Could you explain this please?

The CAP is beeing constantly reduced during the last years because the EU wants a consolidation of the agriculture sector in the EU (bigger farms, less small family business) on the one side and the subsidies kind of destroy the agriculture in third-world countries because these don't have the eu-subsidies and therefore can't produce that cheap goods. When these farmers can't compete even on their national markets (because imported goods are cheaper), they go out of business, which leads to more unemployment, poverty, desertification and dependency.

true,flusterer,EURO,European Union,"Spain: historically the colonization of South America was both a boon and a curse. It brought riches, that's for sure, tons of gold, silver, and other precious cargo were arriving to Spain non-stop. However that was a windfall, no real improvement happened in the society nor in the industry later on. People grew used to live from the yields, and working was considered inferior. If you have read Don Quixote, maybe you are already familiar with the term 'hidalgo' and the poor nobles that just wanted to keep the appearances in spite of everything else.    
Forward to the age of Enlightenment. We missed it. Spain had the chance of either importing ideas from the French invaders, or create our own system away from the monarchy. Instead, the French were expelled, and one the worst monarchs in Spain's history reinstated (Fernando VII).    
Forward to the Industrial Revolution, we missed that again. Without a proper social contract, without a proper land distribution, capital was very concentrated on an oligarchy that fought all progress. Spain remained rural and uneducated. Last colonies were lost. The social climate in 1898 was of extreme pessimism.     
Next opportunity was during the II Republic, there was such the need of change that it went to the extremes. Fanaticism appeared on both sides, the country was wrecked, and 40 years of dictatorship followed it. If there was a regime change was more because of the death of the dictator, and maybe international pressure (the CIA might have played a role during the transition), than because of the actions of the population. As with the gold influx from America, when you get something without working for it or without being prepared for that, in the end it doesn't work.     
The democracy in Spain is only democratic in name, there are elections, but there is no real separation of powers (and the little Independence was abolished in 1985), public participation and involvement has been minimal aside from casting the vote once every 4 years. The thinking was that you have to accept what you are given and there is nothing you can do to change that. With that thinking, little political control, and a culture of favoring your friends even if it is illegal, we arrived to the actual situation of +25% unemployment and a deindustrilized country. Polarization of the political spectrum is still present, egotism is still present, lack of responsibility and involvement are still present. Luckily this harsh situation is being a real eye opener for many people that before supported the current political system. Younger generations want a change (cfr. 15-M protests, young unemployment is around 50%), however change won't happen until life conditions become unbearable for the majority of the population, and only then the state will be reformed.

You're working three jobs and can't afford to feed your children or take yourself to a doctor? Fuck you, work harder. Nobody gives a flying fuck about your problems, you're expected to provide for yourself and your family. Where I'm from you're expected to have a job by the time you're 16. When I was in high school I worked 30-35 hours a week at nights (employers will do everything they can to keep you under ""full time"" 40 hours a week so they don't have to give you any benefits (insurance)) and went to school during the day. That's pretty standard where I'm from. 

I can remember one of the girls I worked with in high school had a pretty nasty ear infection. She was probably 22 or so. She had no insurance and couldn't afford to see a doctor. So she just bought over the counter medicine and hoped for the best. About half of us thought that it was just another sign that the ""system"" was fucked up, this poor girl should get medical attention regardless of her income. The other half wrote it off as ""She can't afford insurance? She must not work hard enough. Fuck her"".

It's a big part of our culture to not take ""hand-outs"". You work damnit. The only way it's even somewhat socially acceptable to get some financial help is if it's given by blood family and even then it's going to take some convincing to accept and I *will* pay you back. Things like Medicare and Social Security are alright as you pay into it your entire life so it's acceptable to take back once you reach that age.

I'd say all the self-reliance stuff ties into the distrust of authority and the borderline hatred for the federal government. There's pretty big regional and state loyalties. After all, our country is so damn *big*. The distance from L.A. to New York is farther than Lisbon, Portugal to Moscow. Think about that for a second. There's big differences in regional cultures. On our T.V. shows, half the time they're subtitled. When those shows with the people from the Louisiana Bayou or the people from Boston or New Jersey come up I can't understand a word they're saying. 

I'm from the midwest, I've never been farther West than Iowa. Never been to California. I've never been to New York. I've never been to Hawaii. Most everyone I know was born in my town and most of us are expected to live there until we die (this has begun to change though).

Sorry if this seems somewhat fragmented and rambling. I just woke up and am running late for class. Someone else can probably explain and format much better than I can. I'm more than happy to elaborate and expand though.

That's a loaded question. It was definitly no waste of money from the state's POV, having people work full time in social services for ~€1,20 per hour can certainly not be considered a ""waste of money"" (even if you take into consideration that Zivildienst is just a subsection of Wehrdienst which was a costly way of having a ""citizens' army""). And yet, it was forcing a specific social group (physically fit young males to be precise) to work for immorally low wages with the threat of a prison sentence should they refuse, therefore I have a hard time calling it a ""force for good"".

It's a good thing. Doing it certainly didn't hurt me, but anyone who wants to have this experience can choose to volunteer for a year. Freedom and choice gained, nothing lost for those who would have participated in it otherwise.
 
&gt;Do you think it caused a social divide, i.e. young people from lower income backgrounds more inclined to serve in the military for a year whilst the more well off would serve for a year in the Zivildienst? 
 
No, not really. In its early stages it might have been problematic, but at the end the bar to get accepted into Zivildienst was not set all that high anymore and it was basically open for all young males.
 
&gt;Or, is the opposite true? Did the program serve to bring young people together through a shared experience of civilian service?
 
No, the experiences people had during Zivildienst are too diverse to achieve that - it's basically limited to working a year for ridiculously low pay, other than that the jobs people could take were rather varied (though obviously limited to work that did not require any extensive training).",0,1361204307,null,0,false,0,c8h8onq,t3_18qvsx,t1_c8h8onq,t3_18qvsx,null,1431329215,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

They generally work more like insurance than buying a stock or product directly. For example you could purchase an interest rate swap that costs you maybe $5,000 a month but if the baseline US Fed Interest Rate goes above say 3% it pays out $1,000,000. The actual cost of buying the derivative will be a lot lower than the face value (or no-one would buy them).

Most of the 'value' of a derivative may never actually be realised at all. So just adding up all the face values (which is where the enormous $X trillion values come from) distorts the actual payouts and risks involved. Also a lot of these derivatives will pay out in situations the opposite of other derivatives (so they can't all be realised).

What on Earth are you talking about?  Lamarckian evolutionary theory is completely different to Darwinism, and Lamarck died when Darwin was 20 years old.  This is high school biology in the UK.  Your post makes it sound like the two were contemperaneous, with Darwin just having beaten him in a close race to the finishing post.  How could he have been ""working"" on a theory when he was dead?

Besides, you completely miss the point of why we credit Darwin with the discovery.  He didn't just come up with the theory, he actively sought comprehensive evidence for that theory and then packaged the whole lot in a series of publications that the lay reader could understand.

&gt; Because it would hinder their competitors..

Um no.  Abolitionism was pushed by various non-conformist groups and the movement gathered steam over the best part of a century, with various legal rulings also chipping away at slavery's legal status (or lack of it, c.f. Sommerset's Case).  It wasn't a top down decision by the government that came from completely out of the blue, but one that had widespread public support especially amongst the newly politicised working classes in industrial cities that had been targeted by the likes of the Quakers.  Further, there were many British towns that relied heavily on the slave trade for their income.  Bath and Liverpool were two cities that were mostly built on slave money and relied on it for their income.

No offence, but judging by my limited interactions with you in this subreddit, you seem to be the stereotypical bitter Continental cunt that gets right up the noses of the British; always too eager to try to play down any achievement on the part of the British whilst crediting others with the achievement, no matter how little you actually understand of it.",0,1361207791,null,0,1361208878,0,c8h9qvo,t3_18qqv4,t1_c8h9qvo,t1_c8h75hs,null,1431329759,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,gerusz,HUNG,Hungarian living in the Netherlands,"Yes. It's too many, especially considering the extra wage gained by getting a college / university degree and the taxes.

But this isn't even the main problem with the whole concept. This is again very typical from the current government: treating a symptom while ignoring the root of the problems.

Despite the government's subtle(?) defamation tactics, young graduates aren't leaving the country only because they get paid more. It's a favorite strategy of Fidesz, painting everyone who is not with them as traitors, antihungarians, lazy parasites, etc... - if things get uglier, I expect the phrase ""30 silver coins"" to arise in the government's communication.

Young graduates are leaving the country because:

1. They can't get a job, especially not in their area of expertise. The economy is ruined, private companies aren't hiring (quite the opposite, usually), most of them have a deficit or barely make the bottom line. They simply can't afford to hire a graduate.
2. The whole country is deep in depression. Not only economically, psychologically. Everybody is constantly annoyed, people are tired, frowning, neglect themselves, etc...
3. Hopelessness. There was an emigration in the last government cycle too, but it was lower because people were still hoping that this government will fix the country. Especially because they actually had the power. Now even this hope is completely shot, the current ones aren't a bit better than the previous mafia. In fact, they absolutely lack the subtlety of the previous ones; they had several decades of practice, they pretty much turned ""how to steal without making it too obvious"" to an art form. Yes, they were stealing, but at least made an effort to hide it. The current guys don't have the practice, as a result the stealing and corruption is extremely in-your-face. The prime minister is a narcissistic jackass with a huge Napoleon-complex, the economic minister is basically retarded, the minister of internal affairs is a well-known crime lord, etc... And there are no new ones on the palette. On the next election people can choose between the gang that's fucking up the country right now, the gang that fucked up the country before them (separated into several parties) and extremists.
4. Nepotism. In the West, getting a job without knowing anyone is hard. In Hungary it's impossible. And even if you know some people in the company and you're the most qualified person applying for a position, it's not guaranteed that you get the job because the CEO's uneducated nephew might be looking for a job as well. (This applies more to Hungarian companies than multinational ones... and *especially* applies for public-owned companies where expressing dislike for the government on Facebook might be grounds for termination)
5. Obviously, the money. In Western Europe you can at least save up from your wage. Not in Hungary. 42% of the young people still live with their parents and not because family ties were stronger. The middle class is almost nonexistent, even people who earn the 140.000 Ft have to buy clothes from thrift stores, buy cheap food, etc...

I left the country in September. I miss a lot of things. I miss the food, I miss the cheap bars, I miss the girls, I miss my family, I miss my friends, I miss Budapest... but despite all of this, I'm happier here in the Netherlands than I was back ""home"". People are *way* friendlier and more helpful, I'm not feeling the usual hopelessness and I don't even know who is the prime minister because I don't have to.

A much better definition would be returning MPs or securing high numbers of votes or having some sort of representation in government. Just because a movement gets huge media coverage (a huge following) doesn't mean it is successful, but if it has some sort of power in government, it certainly is to an extent successful and will have media attention of some sort.

By that measure Scotland is the only separatist movement which has *significant* success. However I think Catalonia has certain representation in its devolved government body as well. After that the next most *prominent* would be Belgium and I'm not sure about that at all.

I am, in the long run, for fragmentation but I think the EU would have to be much more popular and powerful before we can do that so fragmentation at this point is not a good idea.

Do Austrians feel like they're Germans? No!  
Are Austrians, Germans, Swiss, Liechtensteiner something completely different? No way.

It's more or less one people (let's call it West-Germanic), which is divided into a fuckload of sub-groups with different traditions, dialects and even religion (Styrians, Tyrolians, Sachsen, Schwaben, Bayern, Franken, Züricher, Berner, etc. etc). Those sub-groups formed federations which are the current states. Austria always considered itself part of the shared German(ic) culture but not part of Germany  We were Germans in Austria, but not a part of Germany. One people in two countries (let's forget the Swiss for now, they made their own club long before), if it weren't for our extended empire we would have been part of the first Germany without any discussion. 

After WW2 we needed and wanted to separate ourselves from Germany all together, suddenly everybody tried to not see the huge similarities between our countries and searched for the small differences. But after all it's just a matter of distance between two random people which makes up the biggest part of the differences. A Bavarian is more like a Salzburger or Tiroler than a North-German, some German from BaWü on the border to Switzerland is more like a Swiss than a Berliner.

TL/DR: If they Germans wouldn't have taken the name ""Deutschland"" we would probably still call us Deutsche, but since they took the name and we developed a strong distancing need from them after WWII (not as strong as the Swiss always did though) you are insulting every Austrian when you call them German. 

PS: Even the Dutch called themselves German for a long time, long before Germany was a thing.  
PPS: You could also throw this question to a Norwegian about feeling Danish or Swedish, or an Canadian about being American, New Zealanders and Australians etc etc Shared heritage, divided by history, now pretending to be nothing alike

But this is indeed a problem in Greece, cause when you are 7 yo at the elementary school, and your teacher gets serious (as in soap opera actor serious) and goes ""when we were building the parthenon they were up in trees harvesting nuts"", you take this for real.

Continental Civil Law with its closer association with Legal Positivism has led to a presumption of positive liberty.

Rights are defined as things you are allowed to do by the sovereign such as freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly. You are enabled to do these things.

This is probably why we have the most single households in the world, tha largest amount of women in the workforce and a low percentage of ""young adults"" living with their parents. This do also means that Swedes hate having debts to anyone, people will even pay back ""loans"" of just some cent.

We do also have a culture of consensus, which means that there will always be endless meetings until everyone has agreed to something. We're very afraid of conflict, kind of like Japanese. We do also have some proverbs like ""speaking is silver, silence is gold"", but foreigners will probably think we're cold or smug when we're quiet.

true,keepthepace,FRAN,France,"EDIT : after reading al the negative things people have to say about their respective countries, I guess you will spot a trait commonly and rightly attributed to French : we are arrogantly proud :) I guess there is some truth to the story that the rooster is France's national animal because it is the only bird that sings with both feet in the shit...

Discussing this with my Japanese wife, there seems to be two very clear events that shaped the French mentality : the French revolution and the WWII occupation by nazis.

French revolution is still very present in our culture and history. Its message is clear : tyranny is not something that the French people will accept easily, and riots are to be taken seriously as they can end up into a revolution. Whether it is a myth that this can happen again today, this is a belief that is still here.

The other one, and maybe the most obvious, is what happened in WWII when the population was divided in two parts : resistants and collaborators. In the end, resistants are now considered to be the heroes and collaborators the bad guys. The interesting thing is that collaborators were the legalists, they were the one following the law. Resistants were considered terrorists, outlaws and traitors during occupation. It is worth noticing that the official French government had surrendered and declared the people continuing to fight to be in illegality and labeled them terrorists. 

The end result is that ""it is the law"" will not appear as a good enough reason for most French to comply to something. The law can be wrong and has been in the past. What you should do is what is good, not what is legal. 

Another less obvious characteristic of France is its anticlericality. It took me a long time to see that this was really uncommon in other countries. A lot of French people will believe that many ideqs of the Enlightenment originated from France, but actually most of the democratic ideas came from England and Germany. Only one idea, the defiance against religion, originated in France.

That put off a lot of people. That it didn't carry over the legacy Netscape compatibility that Firefox did didn't count much in its favour, either- as an Opera user way back then, it was basically a necessity to have IE on hand to open the ~30% of sites that didn't play nicely with anything but IE. 

Then, of course, along came Firefox- with extension support, speed, marginally better compatibility (at least at first), and a much, *much* better marketing campaign.

think it was a good thing,  most social or health related facilities lack funds.

well it was necessary with the end of the wehrpflicht, but i wish they would have introduced some kind of compulsory ""social year"" but i guess it would cause major problems to define this law.

&gt; Do you think it caused a social divide, i.e. young people from lower income backgrounds more inclined to serve in the military for a year whilst the more well off would serve for a year in the Zivildienst? 

not from my experience, if people complained about the army then there were usually higher ranks involved.

&gt; Or, is the opposite true? Did the program serve to bring young people together through a shared experience of civilian service?

i have meet a lot of nice people from all backgrounds and still have contact to some of them.

That's not to say all, or even most, Serbian nationalists are like this, certainly not all Serbians. But, there are a special few with really ""out there"" ideas.

First, some of them believe Croatians and Bosniaks are Serbians, only with different religion, and Croatian language is a modern falsification, we all speak Serbian. This is one of the more widespread and believable ones. 

On the other hand, there is a guy (who has a Ph.D) who claims that Jesus and the Apostols spoke Serbian, and that Phillip and Alexander the Macedonian were Serbians (after all, Macedonians are neighbors, ) and speak a South Slavic language.

But they are not the same. Surely, the context determines the word ""noch"", but the meaning is different.

3rd meaning: ""Sind wir fertig?"" - ""Noch nicht.""
""Are we done?"" - ""Not yet.""
The meaning is that something hasn't been done until now, but it will be done in the future: We aren't done yet, but soon we will be done.

2nd meaning: ""Wir sollten noch einen Termin ausmachen.""
""We should settle an appointment (in the future).""
The meaning is that something will still happen. That's not identical with the 3rd meaning.

People who live in big cities and (especially) work in tourist industries tend to speak better English. So that's why when you take a vacation in Berlin, it seems like everybody in Germany speaks English.

Source: I have family in the former East Germany. When we visited, they had to make sure the younger members of the family were around to translate for their elders. The younger members' English was comprehensible, but I would not call it fluent.

PFI deals that push debt off the books and keep the taxpayer paying out for decades to come, ID cards, fire control centres, dodgy wars, throwing money at everything without consideration, NHS IT, most of the grand public sector IT projects, a huge expansion of the public sector, highly paid non-jobs, etc etc etc.

That's just off the top of my head, there's probably a lot more. I wouldn't say they're ""pretty good"", they're pretty awful. 

I'd rather the water company spend it on what civil engineers think is necessary rather than highly paid public sector pen pushers who have no idea what they're really doing or signing but since it's not their money it's okay to waste it.

&gt; It's a fact that many businesses and their shareholders use tax loopholes.

Did you shop at Amazon, play.com, HMV.co.uk or any of the other Jersey online stores? Do you have an ISA? Everyone avoids tax. You're making a massive assumption that every water company does this.

&gt; Governments do not - they have no need to.

No, they'll just get into even more debt to do it. Hence our problems.

- the fee is regarded as unjust, since people tend to not value the public broadcasting stations and their programming (e.g. [this stuff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkst%C3%BCmliche_Musik)). There is a huge debate on what the public broadcasting organizations should cover in their programming (amount and kind of entertainment, sports?)
- the fee has to be paid even if you don't watch TV at all (but own a working TV set). The fee has also to be paid for computers and ""things that can connect to the internet"" (even if you never listen to any radio or watch TV on them).
- the GEZ outsourced the investigation of TV ownership to individuals, which then sometimes tricked non paying citizens into admitting to own a TV set
- there are stories where the GEZ wrote invoices to the deceased, and then were quite insensitive about communicating with the bereaved (e.g. demanding a death certificate)

I don't know if all the horror stories about the GEZ are actually true and happen that often, but they shape the public perception a lot. Most of the people I know are in favor to have just an increase in taxes and to get rid of all the GEZ bureaucracy: But this is not likely to happen. The reason is that the public broadcasting stations are supposed to be independent from the government (good idea IMO) so they can't be financed by taxes (when in fact they are financed by a very tax-like fee system).",0,1361220376,null,0,false,0,c8he1kh,t3_18jhll,t1_c8he1kh,t1_c8h65s2,null,1431332104,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

(here with [translated lyrics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGt8ZRLYy2o) but crappy sound)

I also like some of the (perhaps overtly) patriotic military marches, not because of kickass nationalism but because of their history. Knowing the relevant history I can relate to those guys in those times and feel like a copatriot with them, and the marches also show how our history entwines with the larger history of Europe.

* [March of the Finnish Cavalry during the Thirty Years War (1618 - 1648)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YSkW4sJU4) or Hakkapeliittain Marssi/March of Hakkapeliittas.  
Those days Finland was part of Sweden, and I like how Swedish and Finnish cavalries still share this battle march as part of our common military history. Was a horrible war that, [Hakkaa päälle!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakkapeliitta)

* [Suomen Kaartin paluumarssi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gztGzNljqW4) / Finnish Guard's Return March (from the Russo-Turkish War 1878).  
Then Finland was autonomous part of Russian Empire. Finns were with Romanians and Bulgarians fighting against Ottomans for Romanian and Bulgarian independence, and one especially memorable victory was [Battle of Gorni Dubnik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gorni_Dubnik). I can imagine them marching back home to Finland singing this, gotta love the lyrics:  
*""Long we have suffered cold and hunger,  
fighting in the Balkan mountains...""*

* [Sibelius: Jääkärimarssi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7b8E2lgLY4) / Jäger March (1917)  
Written and composed in defiance of the Russian rule. Finnish volunteers (Jägers) were in Germany in clandestine military training and preparing to fight the Russians. Shortly thereafter Finland became independend (and had a horrible civil war).

It would be highly unrespectful to our neighbours and apart from the far right nobody in Hungary thinks that we should invade them. 


However, we do think that it's important to protect the rights of ethnic Hungarians living in other countries. (That's not really what our goverment does though.)

Finally, this might be odd, but nationalism and hard rock both were means for the youth to express their feelings against the communist regime in the '80s, hence a 'rock opera' titled ""Stephen, the king"" about the first king and the foundation of the Hungarian kingdom has come to life.

I feel it would be accurate to say that most younger Germans can, at the least, understand a fair amount of English and speak a bit. Depends a lot on your schooling and work.

I've been using Opera for over 15 years now. It came first with all the major improvements that eventually all major web browsers implemented. It still feels faster to me than IE/FF/Chrome to me. In addition to that, it has some other cool perks that the rest doesn't (without spending time to install various plugins etc). It is better, but, generally not by that much for most people. Open source-ness and anti-IE-ness was the selling point of Firefox, then later, Google-ness was the biggest selling point of Chrome and they became major players. 

I used to be a web developer, and it was a huge pain to optimize for major web browser (meaning, IEs, Firefox, Safari and Chrome). Opera, with its tiny market share, had to resort to the laborious process of optimization to work with major websites, because the web developers wouldn't waste time to optimize for such a small webbrowser. Earlier versions of Opera even identified themselves as IE to spare users from ""this page isn't optimized for your web browser"" sort of messages. So the Opera guys had to spend significant amount of time to optimize for the major web browsers strange quirks. 

Yes, there are standards, but no major browsers seems to be taking them too seriously, as of course, they all assume web developers test everything for all major web browsers.

Sorry, only in Swedish. I remember it was a long series of articles, several years ago in a series on Sweden's economics in the 90's, since that was a very turbulent times for us. Then there was quotes from Tobin saying he was opposed to the implementation in Sweden, which you might know, was a spectacular failure. 

He was also deeply against the fact, that the Tobin tax, was hijacked by the the anti-globlisation movement. Here is a quote: 

""I have absolutely nothing in common with those anti-globalisation rebels. Of course I am pleased; but the loudest applause is coming from the wrong side. Look, I am an economist and, like most economists, I support free trade. Furthermore, I am in favour of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation. They've hijacked my name. ... The tax on foreign exchange transactions was devised to cushion exchange rate fluctuations.[4][5][6][7] (See last part of quote in the above lead section)."" From Wiki. 

I do know what Tobin *really* wanted, was deeper financial integration but since he didn't know how to achieve that, he suggested the tax. Also, his original proposal was towards foreign exchange only. 

What you posted was a link to the European Union, of course they are going to be positive about it. It is like asking if they think they are doing a good job. Are they going to say no? I was after more neutral research. 

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction_tax#Effect_on_volatility) is some (albeit wiki) articles why it might not be successful, not all research, and certainly not implementation says so.

As a german i say noch whith more feeling than logik.
I wouldnt care so much about it. 
I think that noch is in this 2 sentences the same. The 3rd and 2nd nochs are both telling that s.th. will come. Only the time changed.
So this ""Noch nicht"" is like ""We aren't done yet, but soon we will be done."" And the ""Wir sollten noch einen Termin ausmachen."" is ""We aren't done yet, but soon we will be done."" too^^ Or better: We havn't done a termin(or date?)(i think in english its different?=)), but soon we will do one.""

The difference is the time of the sentence, but both ""nochs"" are the same for me. 
But maybe ur right. Im looking at Germanpractice and notice that the simplest words are the difficultest in other countrys, very interresting. And this easy words are really hard to explain!

true,BusHeckler,EURO,European Union,"I feel bad for using the word moronic, sorry. Having re-read your questions in the context of your comment I can see where you're coming from. As an apology here's some thoughts: 

I think it's really good to have a discussion group like yours, I think the statements and questions are rather loaded towards giving certain answers though.

The welfare systems in most EU countries, like the UK for example, as that's where I'm from, tend to presume that the service itself is necessary and the means is split in a way that invisibly funds it through taxes that come out automatically from your income - like National Insurance here, income tax and all sorts of other things. This means that the burden of supporting huge systems like the National Health Service is spread in such a way that it's not actually felt that much. More difficult and painful taxes are things like the road tax on cars and the council taxes that are set by local governments to support services like refuse collection and child services. These taxes are paid on a per household basis so if you live on your own it can be quite a burden indeed. Large taxes are paid on all consumer goods, with a 20% VAT rate (sales tax) and prices at the petrol pump are at £1.40 per litre (google tells me that's $8.21 per gallon). Higher taxation however, does not mean that we have to pay it if we are poor. If you earn under a certain threshold, you get housing benefit that pays for your rent (yes, 100% of it), you can get exempted from council tax and you can get certain levels of cash payments so long as you prove you are jobseeking if you're out of employment. All health care is free up front.

As for whether this is contributing to our debt? I doubt it, though I am no expert. Welfare in the UK is currently having massive cuts because of the right wing government that is seeking to reduce all budgets, but ultimately most people who need support still get it. The things that are going are things like some child tax credits - payments to families with children - when they earn above certain amounts.

The EU Commission and European Parliament still has a relatively weak influence on how we Europeans live. At least 90% of what happens in our lives is down to national parliaments, and the EU budget is largely devoted to infrastructure in development areas - particularly felt in the former Eastern Bloc countries but I have seen some EU funded schemes in the North of England. That and subsidising farmers and other industries affected by the common agricultural policy that controls food surpluses and protects market value of crop (very controversial as it means that surpluses are destroyed).

The really powerful body is still the Council of Ministers, which brings together all the ministers that act under certain competencies so they can decide common policies and strategies for moving forward together. The Council can therefore facilitate decision making by bypassing the European framework and getting common or similar bills through the participating countries' parliaments. Say all the chancellors/economic/finance ministers all decide a tax on paint is needed - it wouldn't need to go through the European parliament if all the governments just introduced a bill saying they wanted to tax paint.

I digress, but hopefully that was interesting enough to make up for my incredible rudeness. Very sorry, again.",0,1361228421,null,0,false,0,c8hgr6k,t3_18ovk6,t1_c8hgr6k,t1_c8hf9ca,null,1431333376,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Well the problem is that there isn't a social organization resembeling a anarcho-syndicalist organization in Somalia. It's society(ies) are organized by muslim militias, government supporters, and a few others. It isn't anarchist because it lacks all the proprietys that identifies a anarchist organizational plattform.

I thought it was anarchist because there was no government. If anarchy is the lack of an organisational platform, then I guess there will never be anarchy, as humans organise themselves, even if not through actual organisations, they organise themselves even within their families.

&gt;If you are a communist and thinks that the way to abolish the state is to strengthen it, it sounds quite paradoxal to me.

I'm certainly not a communist but I assumed that in the process of achieving the stateless and classless society, that first there would have to be a state to remove the barriers for that already present in our society. I mean, that's what's in the Communist Manifesto, right? A communist state to abolish the old order is required to pave way, right?

&gt;Atleast from the experience of Libertarian socialist is to as I said in my first post.

Libertarian socialist makes just as much sense as a capitalist communist or a cat dog.

Libertarian refers to liberty for the individual, freedom from coercion, voluntary association and voluntary exchange, a society where the government as a limited role, only acting in those areas that can't be provided by anybody else like public safety or a justice system.

Socialism, on the other hand, means common ownership of the means of production and government rule over what should be done, some people planning what others should do, it's in direct conflict with libertarianism, it requires coercion as for you to redistribute you must first take something away from somebody else, it doesn't respect private property and it focuses on society as a whole and not on each individual separately.

&gt;It's basically the first step to push economical and desicion making power from the state and capital towards the population.

Shifting the power from the state and the capital towards the population? What is the state if not the people the population elected? What is the capital if not the resources each and every individual in the population already has?

Last time I checked, the people in government and the people running businesses where not reptilians, they were people that got elected or that started their own business or rose through the ranks of their companies, saying we need to take those back makes just as much sense and me breaking into my own house.

&gt;When the Unions have amassed enough people it can start to take the funktions that the state and free market had previously.

Yeah, call me a counter-revolutionary but that's not going to happen. Fine, feel free to take away power from the state, they really shouldn't be interfering with the market anyway, they most they should do is force people to internalise their externalities and they've gone way past that. But to take away power from the free market? That's quite hilarious, if you don't want to deal with it, don't, it doesn't force you, cultivate your own food and live off the land, tell the butcher and the baker to go fuck themselves, you don't need to deal with them, after all, it's a free market, you only take a part in it if you voluntarily agree to it.",0,1361229444,null,0,false,0,c8hh2jk,t3_18pkdt,t1_c8hh2jk,t1_c8hg8qi,null,1431333528,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Pacioli was a mathematician and he devised this self-checking system to allow merchants to keep track of their financial transactions minimizing the risk of errors and without using negative numbers, which I think would have been too difficult for an ordinary merchant at the time. The T-account is said to resemble a cross, because Pacioli was a friar, but I find it hard to believe.

true,kabbinet,BKFG,Anarchism,"&gt; I thought it was anarchist because there was no government. If anarchy is the lack of an organisational platform, then I guess there will never be anarchy, as humans organise themselves, even if not through actual organisations, they organise themselves even within their families.

Just because a society lacks a governmental institution dosn't equal it as anarchist. To label a society as anarchist it needs a anarchistic organization. I.e. Direct democratic organization that governs both economy and society.

&gt; I'm certainly not a communist 

Sorry I didn't mean you were a communist, it was a figure of speach, I should have said: Suppose a communist or something in that manner.

&gt; but I assumed that in the process of achieving the stateless and classless society, that first there would have to be a state to remove the barriers for that already present in our society. I mean, that's what's in the Communist Manifesto, right? A communist state to abolish the old order is required to pave way, right?

Yes you are correct. But I'm an anarchist we mean that a socialist society cannot be implemented with the use of a state. It's up to people themselves to govern society after they have aquired direct democratic rule.

&gt; Libertarian socialist makes...

Libertarian in the original sense means anarchist basically. And it was a way to distinguish it self from the authoritarian marxists, leninsits, and from reformists. A libertarian socialist seeks to implement a socialist society without coercion from a state or capitalist economy. It's a free association of people in a community that works cooperatively. There is no discrepancy in that statement unless you define socialism as Imposed collectivsm.

&gt;Shifting the power from the state and the capital towards the population? What is the state if not the people the population elected? What is the capital if not the resources each and every individual in the population already has?

The state is a body of institutions not controlled by the people, You might be able to vote for polititians but you can't vote for the people it employs, nor do you have a direct influence on it's detailed actions. 

&gt; Last time I checked, the people in government and the people running businesses where not reptilians, they were people that got elected or that started their own business or rose through the ranks of their companies, saying we need to take those back makes just as much sense and me breaking into my own house.

I never said they were reptilians :/ What we mostly object to is the lack of democratic practice within both the state, capital and representative democracy. 

&gt; Yeah, call me a counter-revolutionary but that's not going to happen. Fine, feel free to take away power from the state, they really shouldn't be interfering with the market anyway, they most they should do is force people to internalise their externalities and they've gone way past that. But to take away power from the free market? That's quite hilarious, if you don't want to deal with it, don't, it doesn't force you, cultivate your own food and live off the land, tell the butcher and the baker to go fuck themselves, you don't need to deal with them, after all, it's a free market, you only take a part in it if you voluntarily agree to it.

What makes you think that the farmers, bakers, butchers isn't allowed to collectivize? ",0,1361233002,null,0,false,0,c8hi4sv,t3_18pkdt,t1_c8hi4sv,t1_c8hh2jk,null,1431334045,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
