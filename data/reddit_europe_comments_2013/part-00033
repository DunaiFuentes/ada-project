Wou, that was 43 years ago...

And that title ""disarmed"" is just shit. The US forces in Europe was an occupation force which turned during the cold war mainly and only as a US force against USSR.

European countries have nukes, own missiles, navy's, tanks, satellites, drones and ...everything. We don't need US to create tension between Russia. We want peace and we are looking to increase our trade with Russia. And Russia has withdrawn its troops and are now only capable of defense at the west border. Like Europe is. We have learned our lesson.

Now when the political and military tensions are rising in Pacific region, there is no need for ""preparations against massive Red Army and Warsaw Pact"" attack through the Fulda Cap.

The Danish are very active in Nato at the moment because they are becoming a Big Oil and Gas producer in North Pole region. They are afraid that they can't hold those areas and therefore are licking the US butt hard. They are even ready to poke Muslims with that ""Cartoon drawing"" shit and that is just shitty ugly propaganda they use to create reasons why they are in Afghanistan even with their Air Force. Vikings, yeah my ass.

No body is surrendering to Russia. US can get their 2. class troops out of here. And we are not alone. It's USA who is alone, if they don't change their attitude and fix their unhealthy monetary system which draws us down every time when they go down.

Presumably you would argue that the reference in the pledge of allegiance to the flag links back to the constitution, rather than being just about 'general feelings of national pride and broad ideals'.

The point about the Presidential control isn't about poor strategy or logistics (!), but about centralization of power, and about the lack of Congressional/Parliamentary authorization for war. This is partly also what I was talking about in terms of the flag, the way in which, when push comes to shove, these things usually come down to people massing behind banners.

There's an example of what I'm talking about is in the recent Lincoln film, about the self-acknowledged contradictions in Lincoln's positions on the Declaration of Emancipation (although presumably the public self-acknowledgement is not factual). Incidentally, this seems to me an interesting aspect of American shared political culture. In one of the most seminal moments of American history, what would traditionally be thought of as two intertwined, progressive, liberal principles - anti-slavery and self-determination - were in fact ranged against each other. And that appears to have echoed onwards for a long time afterwards, with state's rights debates, particularly around the civil rights movement.

Personally, I don't want the automatic spending cuts, I want *real* cuts passed with our future budgets. The fact that we are responsible for 43% of the World military spending is ridiculous.

When i finished school in 2001 there was the first reduction of miliary under SPD government, i think it happened 1. Okt. of said year. But the exact date is not so important.

What's more important is that my first scheduled checkup for miliary was arround a month before the political change occured. But the doctor called in sick so my appointment was postponed to a date after the date where the size of german military got reduced and thatfore the medical requirements were raised to compensate.

I was judged ""untauglich"" (disqualified) because of my shortsighness so i didn't have to attent military nor Zivildienst.

As far as I can remember, the only way to legally avoid paying customs fees is if the item is a gift sent from a private to a private and its value is below 45€. Above that, you're looking at paying roughly (roughly!) 40% in customs and VAT if the parcel is inspected. It may not get inspected, though: the procedure is hit-or-miss, I suppose they pick packages pseudorandomly.

I am not sure I would trust a 400$ phone (with tax&amp;shipping) to Poste Italiane: theft does happen in their logistic hubs. As goerz says, a courier is safer and will clear customs for you but it will be quite more expensive.

 He has some interesting stuff to say if you opened your mind to it. Just have a look at this article: Zionism, Antisemitism, and the People of Palestine. 

He says a lot of things I think you would agree with, that other jews would rage against. If anything, it demonstrates that there could be no such thing as a vast jewish conspiracy, as there are so many different jewish viewpoints that they could never agree on anything. Here are some examples of the things your top professor has to say on Israel, for instance:

&gt;It is a mistake to draw a moral line between Israel and the Occupied Territories; it is all occupied territory. 

&gt;on the basis of ascribed descent, the Zionist officials assign those they have selected a privileged place within the state. If that is not racism, then the term has no meaning.

&gt;Israel’s greatest support comes from the United States, $3 to $5 billion a year, more than what the U.S. gives to any other country and exceeding the total of U.S. grants to the whole of Africa south of the Sahara. Every shell fired into a Palestinian village, every tank used to bulldoze a home, every helicopter gunship is paid for by U.S. dollars.

&gt;The greatest ideological weapon in the Zionist arsenal is the charge of antisemitism.

I can go on and on, but you should really read the article, it is very good and I agree with most of it myself.

Most importantly, he himself, this Harvard professor who you say would be put in jail for saying they should abolish the Jewish race, pretty much says the same thing in this very article:

&gt; The “Jewish” population of Israel includes people from fifty countries, of different physical types, speaking different languages and practicing different religions (or no religion at all), defined as a single people based on the fiction that they, and only they, are descended from the Biblical Abraham. It is so patently false that only Zionists and Nazis even pretend to take it seriously. In fact, given Jewish intermingling with others for two thousand years, it is likely that the Palestinians—themselves the result of the mixture of the various peoples of Canaan plus later waves of Greeks and Arabs—are more directly descended from the ancient inhabitants of the Holy Land than the Europeans displacing them.

In other words, this jewish guy himself actively fights against the idea of a Jewish race. I really wonder what you have to say about that.

true,t_maia,SAAN,Sachsen-Anhalt,"&gt;What did you like most about living in the GDR? What did you dislike the most?

IMO people were more family-oriented. You had to be careful what you said when, so you valued your privacy and turned to family and close friends. Money had less value, bc you could not always buy the things you wanted. To get what you wanted or needed, you needed connections, friends and colleagues, somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody... In a way, the economy itself made friendship more important than money. 

There was very little to worry about, you could always get a job - the problem was just getting a good one. One of the things I disliked was how everything was preordained - the government made important decisions like who could go to university and what you could study. Essentially they looked at your profile when you were 14, 16 and 18 and then decided where they wanted you to work. For example, a friend of mine wanted to study English literature. They did not let her. She was given the choice between studying for an chemical engineers degree or not attending university at all. Somebody higher up had decided they needed more chemical engineers for a factory nearby and so people were pressured into taking that particular course at university. 

I also really disliked how travel was restricted. I love travelling and one of my fantasies as a child was travelling all over the world. I dreamed of getting jobs that allowed me to travel to placed outside of Eastern Germany. When I was ten I even made plans on where to cross the German-German border in secret, so that I could go on to Italy and Spain and whatnot. I had no clue about how dangerous crossing the border was and I knew I could not to tell anybody, not even my parents. But I think I might have tried, if reunification hadn't happened. 

&gt;What do you like the most about living in modern capitalist Germany? What do you dislike the most?

I think modern Germany has the best of both worlds with its Soziale Marktwirtschaft system. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy 

The system allows tremendous individual freedom, compared to the GDR. You can travel, you can choose your own profession, open a business if you want, you have freedom of speech and as long as you got the cash you can buy whatever you want.

I mean that at least the money is spent according to the rules. There's no particular reason those rules can't be changed.

&gt;The CAP is beeing constantly reduced during the last years because the EU wants a consolidation of the agriculture sector in the EU (bigger farms, less small family business) on the one side and the subsidies kind of destroy the agriculture in third-world countries because these don't have the eu-subsidies and therefore can't produce that cheap goods. When these farmers can't compete even on their national markets (because imported goods are cheaper), they go out of business, which leads to more unemployment, poverty, desertification and dependency.

Export and production subsidies are being reduced, but otherwise the CAP is being reformed towards a land stewardship policy rather than just a plain production subsidy.

Part of the problem is that Europe should do more with less, with that demand however comes higher per-unit prices. How much money can be saved with one European fightercraft tender? Instead of pitching Rafale, Typhoon, F35 and Gripen to every nation individually (with most taking laughably small numbers), pitch them to ""Europe"". Each country will be able to get more bang for its buck (quite literally speaking) due to volume discounts and serial production driving the costs down.

The article is spot on in using the word ""disarmed"" because all the guns in the world won't do you much good if they're in the wrong place and you lack the ability to get them to the right place.

How are we getting troops to Mali today? How did we get troops to Afghanistan and Iraq back when? For that matter, how did we get troops to Yugoslavia? 

Irrespective of whether or not you agree with the political rationale behind these wars the fact of the matter remains that if we, as Europe, want to do absolutely anything anywhere that's not inside the EU and a short drive from the barracks we will need the ships and aircraft to ferry our materials and troops.

Similarly, it doesn't matter what excuse we had for having to buy guided weapons from the United States. 

Didn't have any, didn't want to use up precious reserves (what exactly is stopping us from spinning up a munitions plant to bring stocks back up to an acceptable level?)

The main reason that lack of support was the short duration of the winter war. No neighbor would enter the war officially for fear of being dragged into the war(s).

And again, you're looking at this in a black-and-white way, none of these are needed only for invading someone, they're needed for Europe to take any action at all beyond its borders. Take for example Mali, a war which seems to meet with a high rate of approval in this subreddit according to my completely unscientific findings. 

Why is France there so quickly? Because they have a network of bases in former French Africa (currently Djibouti and uh, Chad? I can't be arsed to google where the other one is) where they keep POMCUS, materiel and forward deployed troops. Where would that intervention be today if France had lacked these capacities? Even with that capacity they're still having to ask the US and British forces for some help. They would have benefited from having more prepositioned materiel and a greater capacity for power projection (in the form of more strategic airlifters).

Of course, this argument falls completely on its face if you're of the opinion that the militaries of the EU should do nothing but drills and parades for the rest of their existence because war is over, but if that's the case we might as well just go ahead and abolish the whole thing because it *would* be an exceptionally well armed pension fund at that point.",0,1361268441,null,0,false,0,c8hr175,t3_18scwg,t1_c8hr175,t1_c8hqxhp,null,1431338289,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,[deleted],null,null,"As far as I know from reading around Leibniz's notation was co-opted in the 19th century.  Whilst the notation stayed, the underlying ideas changed.  Excuse the [Wikipedia quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz's_notation):

&gt; The Newton-Leibniz approach to infinitesimal calculus was introduced in the 17th century. While Newton did not have a standard notation for integration, Leibniz began using the character S. He based the character on the Latin word summa (""sum""), which he wrote ſumma with the elongated s commonly used in Germany at the time. This use first appeared publicly in his paper De Geometria, published in Acta Eruditorum of June 1686,[2] but he had been using it in private manuscripts at least since 1675.[3]

&gt; In the 19th century, mathematicians ceased to take Leibniz's notation for derivatives and integrals literally. That is, mathematicians felt that the concept of infinitesimals contained logical contradictions in its development. A number of 19th century mathematicians (Cauchy, Weierstrass and others) found logically rigorous ways to treat derivatives and integrals without infinitesimals using limits as shown above. Nonetheless, Leibniz's notation is still in general use. Although the notation need not be taken literally, it is usually simpler than alternatives when the technique of separation of variables is used in the solution of differential equations. In physical applications, one may for example regard f(x) as measured in meters per second, and dx in seconds, so that f(x) dx is in meters, and so is the value of its definite integral. In that way the Leibniz notation is in harmony with dimensional analysis.

&gt; In the 1960s, building upon earlier work by Edwin Hewitt and Jerzy Łoś, Abraham Robinson developed rigorous mathematical explanations for Leibniz' intuitive notion of the ""infinitesimal,"" and developed non-standard analysis based on these ideas. Robinson's methods are used by only a minority of mathematicians. Jerome Keisler wrote a first-year-calculus textbook based to Robinson's approach.",0,1361270136,null,0,false,0,c8hr787,t3_18qqv4,t1_c8hr787,t1_c8hefa6,null,1431338367,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

This isn't a vote.

&gt;better no. Different - yes.

Different, like Horses and Cows for example.

&gt;The line between life forms able to sense pain and other emotions (those with a CNS) and those not (those without CNS, such as oysters, bacteria and plants) can be clearly drawn.

Then I think you need to read a bit more into the literature as the sensation of 'pain' (and indeed what 'pain' even is) a bit more complicated than that.  This dichotomy also has trouble explaining the boundary and transition to an animal that can be said to feel pain from one that did not.

&gt;The differences between horses/cows/pigs/chickens/humans, in contrast to that, cannot consistently and clearly be layed out and defended.

Now you are insane if you are honestly suggesting that we cannot tell the differences between farm animals.  I think you'll find the whole field of phylogenetic taxonomy works very well in spite of such an obtuse assertion.

But once again all of this is a mere distraction from your consistent inability to understand that people are capable of arriving at different moral values than you are.

true,thatfool,null,null,"You're spot on. We all learn English in high school. I was required to take English classes for seven years (ended up with nine, but the last two were optional). Since then, they've started teaching it even earlier in some elementary schools. There are exceptions: We have different paths for secondary education and those that don't qualify you for university are shorter. You're also right about older Germans who grew up in the East; in the GDR they would have learned Russian instead. But in general we're all taught English in school at some point now.

However, despite all the training we get, we *never* actually need to use the language in day-to-day life. All our movies are dubbed, all our books are translated, all our software is localized, and all the English speaking tourists want to practice their German :P 

I've always made a point of reading novels in the original language if I can read that language. I also prefer English when I watch videos, and some smaller cinemas also sometimes show English originals. I don't watch TV at all, but I could watch British news if I wanted to. I read most of my news in English on the web with the exception of a few local sites. I play video games in English if I can. I have to go out of my way for all of this (some video games and movies aren't even available with English audio in Germany and I have to import them from Austria, streaming is sometimes limited to German, and so on), and none of it actually allows me to practice *speaking English*. I can read five or six languages that I can't speak at all, it just doesn't work if you don't get to use it yourself.

The only reason why I *do* actually speak English reasonably well is that I work for an American company, and we only speak English at work. There was one other German on my team until recently, but we would still communicate in English for the benefit of the others. Most Germans don't have this kind of opportunity. Even with it, my ability to speak English greatly varies for reasons I haven't completely nailed down. On a good day my English is almost accent free or at least passes for some weird accent from some other English speaking country, on a bad day my accent is positively atrocious, sometimes I have people ask me if I'm French, and so on. I suspect it's somehow related to being exposed to so many different accents, or even dialects, between all the American English accents, British English, Indian English and so on. And of course, to accents of co-workers who aren't native speakers either.

Traveling to English speaking countries often is one of the first things I'd recommend btw. There's nothing like being exposed to a language in a consistent way over the course of a few weeks. Unfortunately I don't really have that option anymore due to some health issues that prevent me from flying, but it's really the best thing you can do if you're serious about learning and *practicing* a second language.

The big drop at the high end of the range is probably also due to less English being taught in school in the past.

The comparison to Scandinavia and France is interesting. In Scandinavia, people generally speak better English but their English actually improves during their 20ies, perhaps because they still have to use it for education or work. OTOH, people in France generally speak English badly or not at all but, at some point in their 20ies, figure out that it's a really useful skill and start learning it.

(Above the 30ies or so, differences in the school system probably don't allow for this kind of statement, but I'm pretty sure it works for teens and 20ies because the amount of English that's taught in school hasn't change by that much in the last 20 years.)

That's as much a requirement as a cost thing. Pacific navies spring for a lot more endurance on their ships than do Atlantic navies because they have more distance to cover. 

The US ""needs"" the C17's capabilities because they have an entire ocean to cross east or west before they'll get to where they need to be. That and the need to move heavier equipment over longer distances. With more troops carried and a larger weight allowance than the C130J the A400M should be more than capable of ferrying the light(er) vehicles and troops to areas like Mali.

Mehrwegpfand is a deposit on re-usable containers that are re-filled after you return them. You'll find this on many glass bottles but not much else. Mehrwegpfand is not regulated by law and anyone can pretty much do whatever they want. In theory, only the exact store where you bought the product is required to return the deposit. In practice, many stores that sell the same *kind* of product or the same *brand* will also accept returned containers, but they're not required to. 

Einwegpfand is a deposit on single use containers that are recycled or destroyed after you return them. This is required on PET bottles and aluminium cans, and regulated by law, and the law generally requires stores to accept returns if they sell containers made from the *same material*. There is an exception for very small stores, but in general, if a supermarket sells PET bottles or aluminium cans, it'll accept returns. Note that smaller stores still have to accept returns of containers they sell regardless of where you actually bought yours, they can just limit it to the exact brands and sizes they sell.

The reverse vending machines used for Einwegpfand will either print a slip that allows you to get your deposit back, or reject your bottle, so you can always try and then sort the rejected ones out later.

* Lockheed C-130 Hercules       14	
* CASA/IPTN CN-235 	24	3 on order
* Transall C-160	39	
* Airbus A400M 	0	50 on order.
* Airbus A340        2	
* Airbus A310	3	

That's 14 planes that can only be used for refuelling.

* 14 C130 Hercules, all H models. Max load weight a hair over 19.000KG and enough room for 2-3 trucks or a single IFV/AFV.
* 24 CN235s, Max load weight a hair under 6000kg, carries 44 troops and not much more.
* 39 C160s, Max load weight 16000kg and carries 99 troops. Might be able to squeeze a truck in there. edit: found a picture of an ERC-90 being squeezed in there. So there we go.
* The A310 and 340 are unable to load trucks nor do they have meaningful rough field capacity.

And you're wondering why France requires additional airlift capacity? Besides the C130s they have no meaningful capacity to transport materiel. The A400M brings a wider load floor and a useful load of 37000KG with it, putting it in a completely different class than the existing capacity. It's not an AN-124, but like I said, find me a source that identifies a need for a transport aircraft of that size for the French (or for that matter the British). Also keep in mind that the C17 is absolutely not a cheap aircraft to own and operate, especially when compared to more rustic alternatives like the IL76. Budgets matter.

Oh, and I completely forgot to mention the fact that the ranges on all but the largest of these airlifters is woefully insufficient to reach Mali, especially once they're loaded to the spars with equipment.

If you are unable to accept that the differences

Further you argue *at the same time* that intra-animal differences are clearly definable *and* that a more rigorous distinction between animals and plants (or animals with and without CNS) is ""more complicated than that"" and thus should be ignored.

In short: Your argument is nonsensical and I believe you are very well aware of that.

&gt; But once again all of this is a mere distraction from your consistent inability to understand that people are capable of arriving at different moral values than you are.

No. All this is an argument about your inability to realise and/or accept that *your* moral values are inconsistent and logically indefensible. So far any time I asked you to defend *your* reasoning you merely ignored the request and responded by twisting one or two sentences of my post into nonsensical form.

Don't bother replying.

In short: I will stop arguing with you because you don't even have an argument. Rather you take pleasure in creating and fighting strawmen. Your problem is that you apparently don't have a consistent ethical system that you could defend. You waste your time defending ""what has always been"" with low-level arguments of strawmen, insults, ad-hominem attacks and purposeful misrepresentation of my position; rather than engage your mind in trying to find a consistent and defensible world view.

There are 2 types and 3 amounts of Pfand:

Mehrweg:

 8cent = glass beer and small soda bottles, normally 0.5l. Exception: flip-top bottles which are 15cent.

15cent = Every other refillable bottle. Doesn't matter if glass, aluminium or plastic.

Einweg:

25cent = Einweg (non-refillable) bottles and cans. They need to have the logo on them. 

Just some tips and clarifications:

Whether a bottle is Einweg or Mehrweg basically depends on the producer. He decides whether he wants 8, 15 or 25 cent. There are thick plastic bottles for 25cent, for example the 1.5l bottles of Adelholzener Still.

A supermarket/Getränkemarkt/whatever is obliged to take back the pfand if the following applies:

1. It sells the same Mehrweg product and has more than 100qm of premisses.

2. It sells similar products with the Einweg logo and has more than 200qm of premisses.

A retailer is NOT obliged to take back Mehrweg Pfand which was not bought in his shop! This is a common misconception. The retailer can decide whether he takes it back or not. This applies especially to cases. We generally handled it like this, if we did not have the case in stock, but the bottles we offered to take back the bottles.

The machines all work the same (because there are only 2 manufacturers). The process is as follows: The machine looks for the einweg logo. The sensor is on the top right. If it doesn't find it, it scans the shape of the bottle and bar code. If the bottle shape and bar code is in the system (stock of the shop), the machine weighs the bottle. If it is too heavy, it does not  accept it. If the barcode matches the shape and it is in the stock database, the machine will accept the bottle. 

It works the fastest if you put the bottle in with the bottom first  and the barcode/einweg logo on the top right. ",0,1361274762,null,0,1361470579,0,c8hrnxs,t3_18rpwa,t1_c8hrnxs,t3_18rpwa,null,1431338591,5,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,5

A three-year undergraduate degree would cost him about 900,000 Hungarian forint, or about $4,100. A two-year master’s degree in communications would be another 900,000 forint.

&gt;While those sums pale in comparison with tuition at state-funded schools in the United States or Britain, they are considered significant in Hungary, where the average monthly salary, after taxes, is 140,000 forint, and where citizens are accustomed to subsidized education.

This is a contradiction, if you think about it. If someone needs to repay that sum (because he went to work in the west), he needs to repay the tuition from a salary earned in the west, not from a typical Hungarian salary. So saying that the tuition is much compared to a Hungarian salary is not real. If someone earns the salary in Hungary, he doesn't have to repay anything.

Also note that the article mentions degrees like law and communication. The tuition is high for degrees for which there is not much demand in the job market. Tuition for other branches wary based on what the demand there is for them. And also for example the tuition for school teacher degree is reduced, specifically to encourage people for taking that.

&gt;animal vs plant

The differences are different but, crucially, there are still differences and one can make consistent moral objections based on those differences.

There is very little difference between cow and human as well but that doesn't stop us making moral objections to eating humans.  We can also make moral objections to eating horses without compromising our approval of eating cows.  That you personally may find it inconsistent because you personally choose different criteria when deciding what and what not to eat is unimportant.  All you are doing is projecting your subjective moral values onto other people and then labelling them hypocrites when they don't agree with you, that's not how it works.

&gt;Further you argue at the same time that intra-animal differences are clearly definable and that a more rigorous distinction between animals and plants (or animals with and without CNS) is ""more complicated than that"" and thus should be ignored.

This was merely application of socratic reasoning to get you to understand that differences are important *and crucially* that they exist within kingdoms as well as between them hence why we eat some animals and not others.

&gt;All this is an argument about your inability to realise and/or accept that your moral values are inconsistent and logically indefensible.

Look back and you'll see that not once I have ever told you what my personal moral values are (because they are unimportant).  Raising objections about your inappropriate usage of words like 'hypocrisy' is not me setting out my own moral case.

&gt;rather than propose a moral argument/distinction of your own.

It was never my intention (as was obviously evidenced, or so I thought, from my first comment) to set out my own personal moral case.  Just  because people don't agree with you that horses and cows are essentially the same doesn't make them guilty of hypocrisy any more than you are guilty of hypocrisy for not sticking to their moral standards.

&gt;his whole conversation relied on the fact that you neither proposed an alternative moral distinction

No, it hinged on your misunderstanding (deliberate or otherwise) of the English language.  I don't need to propose anything to point out where you've gone wrong.

&gt;by anything other than ""it has always been like that"" and ""we can all do what we want"".

The quotation marks give the impression I actually made those arguments whereas I clearly did not.

&gt;I will stop arguing with you because you don't even have an argument.

My 'argument' was an objection to your use of the word hypocrite, an objection you've consistently tried to avoid addressing head on.  It really shouldn't be this difficult to understand that your moral values don't apply to other people.

&gt;Rather you take pleasure in creating and fighting strawmen.

Add 'strawman' to the list of words you don't appear to understand then.

&gt;Your problem is that you apparently don't have a consistent ethical system that you could defend.

I may or may not, but I certainly didn't claim anything of the sort.  You would appear to shifting some sort of rhetorical burden on to me as if because I haven't drafted an ethical framework for you to criticise this therefore means any objections to your fallacious use of words is therefore invalid.  That's not how that works.

&gt;In short: You are a waste of my time and you seriously should consider trying to lay out and examine your own position, as apparently that is something you've never done (or you live with an ethical nihilism in which case this argument is futile anyway).

In the short term, there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the introduction of the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. 

A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the introduction of the euro on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the introduction of the euro. The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of the euro to do so. - [wikipedia/euro/inflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro#Inflation)",0,1361279515,null,0,false,0,c8hs9qu,t3_18t70a,t1_c8hs9qu,t1_c8hru0u,null,1431338940,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

I am seeing a rise in fascism, extremism, resentment to the state, and by the same meter authoritarianism and an abrogation of representation by the state when they do try to 'correct' matters.

Having said that, if the root cause wasn't fiscal, there should be no attempt or argument for the solution being consolidated European debt, bonds, taxation; which would result in only more of the negative counteractions.  When Europe becomes mutually indebted, discussing fiscal integration won't be a issue, and a European tax (surely the next thing around the corner and one that has already been voiced) would pull the rug of autonomy and independence from under people.

Who's 'they', though? Foreigners? I think That's another Belgian problem: we're gullible and afraid. I grew up in the countryside, near the Dutch border, and even there everybody seems to be afraid of te black man or the lazy, moneygrabbing Walloon. Why? Especially in those communities there's no foreigner to be seen, yet everybody seems to think that this country is going to crash any minute due to foreigners taking our jobs. Like we have nothing to offer, or as if we can't get any jobs ourselves. Low self esteem and a negative self image. Maybe that's the influence of the church as well? I'm not sure about that.

I took my grandmother to the Wijnegem Shopping Center the other day. We entered one of the stores and the first thing she said was ""Ugh, look, the place is packed with immigrants."" 'Packed', meaning that there were exactly *two* muslim-looking girls behnd the register, wearing a headscarf. Nevermind the fact that they were the only two actually working (or that they might even be born here), no: ""They look like immigrants, so they should get the hell out."" What?

People like my grandparents get their opinions from the paper and magazines. Quality stuff, ofcourse: Gazet van Antwerpen, Dag Allemaal and Story. I don't know about the magazines, but GvA ususally (if not always) talks about immigrants, not about people. They never talk about 'A., a 45-year old male from Borgerhout', no, they write about the immigrant A. from Borgerhout. And if they don't explicitly mention that he's an immigrant, they'll make sure to mention that he's Moroccan, Turkish of African. Moreover: an article in GvA is never complete without tying immigrants to some sort of criminal behaviour. No wonder older and/or gullible people are afraid to leave their house. Fear is in our daily diet. (And if you're not afraid of immigrants, maybe you should be afraid of gay people! Aah!)

I also like people who are racist, but not against their black neighbour, ""because he's ok"". Maybe we should get out of the house more often and expand our knowledge about other cultures, instead of clinging on to schlagers and the fucking polonaise. Because that's Belgian, eh? No.

Let it be clear that I like Belgium overall, though. These two posts might make it seem otherwise, but like you said, things are not all that bad. Although every Belgian is afraid of the unknown to some degree, most people are really warm and friendly. We like good food and wine/beer and are happy to share.

Do you honestly think that hand carried infantry weapons capable of knocking a tank out of action are a recent occurrence? Tanks are vulnerable but they also have some unique quality's only they can bring to the table. They're a tool, a multifunctional tool.

Do you understand how the German way of insurances / healthcare work?

If so you know, that you could be a ""nurse"" in a private doctors office, you do not need to choose a hospital (which I would not recommend). 

Military hospitals? I do not know if there are any left in Germany... since you know...

What you have to understand is, that besides working in a doctor’s office, where you will not only be nurse but also ""office all-rounder"", there is no real place where nursing and business would come together.

Despite the healthcare business model... if you are interested in Companies that produce, innovate etc... Healthcare stuff just tell me, I can give you a couple of names for that...

But at the moment I am kind of lost, because it is to wide open, sounds for me like: I would like to be a Singer, but I could also sell Pizza. (No offense) What I mean is: be direct or you will not get what you want... and IF you do not know what you want, then you should make no short minded choices. 

Think about what’s really a thing.

Once we have mag weapons (the Americans are doing a lot of research into this, as is Israel) it will essentially be game over for the tank.

During the Blair years it seemed is if it would be something that would happen eventually.

When all of the EU is using the Euro, and Euroland has bounced back and is performing well (and it will happen), it may be in the UK's interests to adopt the Euro.

If/when the Media and Big Business deep it appropriate there will be a big push for it.  Expect the Daily Mail to feature the cool and patriotic designs for UK Euro coins.  A suggestion that we should still use terms like quid and bob.

It may seem like small steps; but already kids are growing up with things like Ryanair and Eeasyjet, meaning even more easy trips to Europe.  Teenagers and early 20somethings think nothing of easyjetting to Europe for a weeknd out.  Europe is a small place; a playground for anyone who can scrape together 80 quid for a return flight.

Before the economic crisis of 2008 it wasn't unusual to see manual workers working on building sites; projects etc. in countries like Spain.

If Freedom of movement can be capitalised on; then businesses will tell staff 'it's far easier for us if you were using the euro'; and the pressure begins from there.

I firmly believe if a UK government finally put serious money into ANY other language as a true 'second language' then things would change.  If most people were truly fluent in in French, Spanish or German as a second language; the doors would feel far more open to them.

This technology, where does it come from? I know where the least armoured areas on a tank are, but where is the computer that can figuire it all out by itself with no human interaction? I suspect you made this up.


&gt;The same reason they keep F-18s around even though the F-22 would wipe the floor with them.

Of course, what you mean here is the reason you imagine they keep both aircraft around but again, it's wrong.

Different tools, different strengths different weaknesses. The f18 for the air force is due to be replaced by the F35 which in itself comes in different configurations depending on its use. 

How big of a logistical supply chain does it take to maintain and arm an F22 Raptor compared to a F18? How quickly can you replace losses? How effective is the F22 compared to the F18 on ground assault missions?

Again I'd like to ask you where you are picking this stuff up, because I would like to read it too.

*Dopo l’addio di Zingales di ieri, un’altra tegola colpisce il movimento di Giannino* 

[**Fermare il declino: se ne va anche il Comitato Garanti**](http://www.linkiesta.it/giannino-comitato-garanti)

di Dario Ronzoni

Ma cosa succede dentro il partito? Perché tutte queste defezioni a pochi giorni dal voto?


Il comitato dei garanti di Fermare il Declino? Non c’è più. È scomparso. Di sicuro, dal sito (la pagina, che prima era accessibile al pubblico, ora è bloccata). Ma quello che è peggio, è che – dicono – è scomparso anche nella realtà. La prima voce è stata quella del nostro collaboratore e blogger Riccardo Puglisi, che lo ha comunicato sul suo twitter, suscitando qualche polemica.
 

La notizia, se confermata (Puglisi scrive che è certa), sarebbe un’ennesima tegolona in testa al povero Oscar Giannino, già colpito ieri dalle dimissioni di Luigi Zingales, economista di spicco del suo partito, perché lo stesso Giannino avrebbe mentito sul suo curriculum accademico. Avrebbe inventato un master all’Università di Chicago Booth –ironia della sorte, proprio quella in cui insegna Zingales.

Se così fosse, proprio pochi giorni prima delle elezioni, Fermare il declino si starebbe sciogliendo, perdendo pezzi, credibilità e diversi elettori. Una Waterloo? Del resto, se la trasparenza era uno dei punti cardine e cardinali del programma di Fare, la bugia di Giannino (che sembra più debolezza che malafede) ha un suo peso, certo. (Anche Carlo Stagnaro, sempre su Twitter, sembra confermare l’ipotesi dimissioni, per «migliorare il controllo di coerenza tra programma elettorale e azione parlamentare»).

Anche se la baruffa sotto le urne ha un sapore strano, e molti si chiedono cosa ci sia sotto. Perché Zingales si accorge solo adesso? Perché i garanti non se la sentono più di garantire? Le ipotesi fioriscono, ma forse, sotto, non c’è nulla. Di sicuro, sembra che l’esperienza di Fermare il Declino, se anche il Comitato se ne va, stia implodendo. Fermati dal declino?

1. Regulate to improve pricing information on derivatives.

2. Regulate to reduce how much leeway a bubble has to grow. (i.e. via firewalling or increasing adequacy)

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Immigrants don't integrate in the US and monoethnic 'ghettos' are more prevalent there than in most parts of Europe. The key difference is Americans don't seem to care as much vs. Europeans. They are used to having African-American ghettos, huge Chinatowns, Hispanic neighbourhoods etc. It becomes part of the 'character' of the city rather than a threat to social cohesion.

I'm honestly wondering: do you live in America? Because I do. I live in a relatively affluent part of the Northeast, in a suburb of Boston; so a very attractive place to live for highly-educated immigrants. Many of the dentists and doctors offices in my town belong to immigrants or their children (and with very obviously non-European names), and their kids went to my school (or to the more prestigious private schools in the area). Maybe there are sizable monoethnic neighborhoods in our cities, but those are constantly in flux as gentrification happens some places and white flight/suburbanization happens elsewhere. But in the suburbs, immigrants integrate into the local community.

Jaja, das letzt stimmt nicht aber whatever.

Ich habe mir vor einiger Zeit angewöhnt sprachlich immer erst den Menschen hervorzuheben, da es in Gesprächen anderen Leuten sehr erschwert abfällige Bemerkungen zu machen indem es sie zwingt zu realisieren worüber sie reden.

Es ist leicht zu sagen ""Die Homosexuellen sind ein widerlicher Haufen"", da hier eine Reduzierung des Menschen auf eine einzige Eigenschaft vorgenommen wird, die von vielen Menschen tatsächlich von ""nicht-ansprechend"" bis ""widerlich"" angesehen wird.

Es ist sehr viel schwerer zu sagen ""Menschen homosexueller Orientierung sind ein ganz widerlicher Haufen"" oder Witze über ""Menschen mit Behinderungen"" zu machen, da der Sprecher hier durch die Sprache gezwungen wird zuerst den Menschen zu sehen und dann eine Eigenschaft. Es wirkt so der entmenschlichenden Rhetorik jener entgegen, die versuchen den Wert einer ganzen Gruppe von Menschen an einer einzelnen Eigenschaft fest zu machen. Dies geschieht bei vielen unbewusst und doch passiert es.

Wenn du einen Menschen homosexueller Orientierung fragst wer er ist, dann wird seine sexuelle Orientierung sicherlich ein Teil dessen sein aber für viele ist das sicherlich nicht **die** Eigenschaft über die sie sich selbst definieren.

France's economy is not suited for a strong Euro, and it's killing her economy. It's much cheaper for an average household to buy an Asian car when Euros  can buy so many US dollars.

If you look at France's balance of trade, she's stuck buying much more than she can sell, since it costs so much for the world to buy her products with such a strong Euro. That's got to have a negative impact on her on the long term.

On the other hand, Germany's economy thrives on a strong currency,  and it's in the German's culture, they want to stay as far as possible from a 1924 catastrophy.

And since the ECB has no other main objective than ""maintaining price stability"" as per [article 127 of the TFEU](http://euwiki.org/TFEU#Article_127), this is bound to cause some friction between the two biggest contributors to the European Union.

Lettera aperta a tutti gli aderenti, simpatizzanti e potenziali elettori di Fare per fermare il declino

Nella condizione di lesa credibilità nella quale mi sono da ieri venuto a trovare, ho ritenuto fin da ieri sera doveroso convocare il nostro unico organo politico, la Direzione. Mancano pochi giorni al voto, ormai prossimi a un grande successo. Ma tutto ciò che per il successo della nostra causa ho messo in discussione della mia vita privata e professionale, mi impone di anteporre la più piena coerenza del nostro movimento a qualunque difesa prioritaria di ciò che ho fatto sotto gli occhi di tutti in Italia per trent’anni, senza mai una sola volta spendere titoli o credenziali che non ho per candidarmi o ottenere cariche, incarichi, pubblicamente o privatamente retribuiti.

Ogni possibile equivoco in materia è un errore del quale mi sono assunto la piena responsabilità, e intendo ancora scusarmi con ciascuno di voi.

Per questo il nostro unico organo politico, la Direzione, domani esaminerà e deciderà in piena libertà tutto ciò che è necessario, vista la condizione nella quale ci troviamo, per rendere forza raddoppiata al nostro sforzo finale. Quando dico “tutto il necessario”, come ho già detto alla stampa, è compresa naturalmente sia la mia disponibilità a continuare a svolgere fino in fondo la funzione attribuitami di Presidente e candidato, quanto, all’opposto, a rinunciare a tutto e al seggio se eletto. Nelle prossime ore, chiedo ai fattivi di esprimere ai membri di direzione come la pensate in materia.

Quanto abbiamo fatto in poche settimane nell’intera Italia non ha precedenti nella storia della politica. E deve andare al successo fin da questa prima tornata elettorale. E’ e resta a nostra portata di mano. Tutti a spingere per il quorum!

- Il nostro paesello, in alta definizione e splendidamente fotografato, è proprio bello.  
  
- è un film dedicato agli Italiani: poco interessato a ricostruire i rapporti causa-effetto che spiegano la situazione politica del paese, colmo di rimandi a volti e fatti poco noti all'estero.   
  
- E' un film che non fa domande, non dà risposte, che non scalfisce mai la superficie, ma che arriva a descrivere una condizione e invita lo spettatore a prenderne coscienza (la nostra fidanzata è in coma)  
    
- le donne intervistate ci fanno un'ottima figura, con proprietà del linguaggio e padronanza dell'inglese che sotterrano i coetanei maschi; purtroppo sono protagoniste solo quando si parla di donne.  Quando il film parla di politica, economia, criminalità e cultura, la parola torna agli uomini (con eccezione della Fornero) e le donne tornano a diventare culi all'interno di un televisore.  
- Non condivido la presenza di Marchionne come portavoce del capitalismo buono. 
- Renzi quando parla inglese pare diversamente abile.
- Il virgolettato da una sentenza di Ingroia su Berlusconi, letto oggi, fa un effetto molto diverso. A posteriori, ritengo la decisione presa da alcuni PM di saltare da un  ""potere"" all'altro una vergogna che discredita l'intero ordinamento dello stato italiano.  
- Molto bravo invece il procuratore intervistato, che rende la trattazione delle tematiche legate alla mafia chiara e interessante.
- Umberto Eco, l'unico che parlando di Italia prova a spiegare gli Italiani.

1 **Transaction Costs**

There will be no longer a cost involved in changing currencies; this will benefit tourists and firms who trade within the EURO area. It has been estimated that this benefit will be equal to 1% of GDP so will be quite significant. (this is sometimes known as frictional costs)

2 **Price Transparency** 

With a common currency it will be easier to compare prices in different European countries because they would all be in Euros. This enables firms to source cheaper raw material and consumers to but cheaper goods For example, new car prices are much higher in the UK than elsewhere, a single currency could help reduce these price differentials.

3 **Eliminating Exchange Rate uncertainty**

Volatile swings in the exchange rate can destroy the profitability of exports. This undermines business confidence in investing. Therefore with a single currency business confidence should improve leading to greater trade and economic growth.

4 **Improvement in Inflation Performance**

The ECB which sets interest rates for the whole Eurozone area will be committed to keeping inflation low; countries with traditionally high inflation will benefit from this. However this point is debatable as countries outside the Euro have maintained low inflation.

5 **Euro could emerge as a global trading currency**

6 **Inward investment**

Inward investment may increase from outside the EU as firms take advantage of lower transaction costs within the EU area. Recently the Chairman of Nissan said the UK would lose inward investment if it stayed out of the Euro

7 **Economizing on foreign currency reserves**

8 **The financial sector could benefit** 

It would be easier to conduct banking and insurance with a single currency. It would be easier to trade German shares on the London stock market

9 **Some possible benefits that are not necessarily economic include** 

Increased global status.

The euro is beginning to rival the dollar as a reserve currency of choice. 

The perceived strength of a country is tied to the strength and world clout of its currency.

The good thing with not being in the Euro is that you still have your own interest rate for example.

*Giannino, dopo il finto master il giallo delle due lauree: sono false anche quelle?*


[**Giannino alla fine confessa ""Una balla pure le lauree""**](http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/personaggi/1187490/Giannino--dopo-il-finto-master--il-giallo-delle-due-lauree---sono-false-anche-quelle-.html)

*Il declino non ha fine*


Il fondatore di Fare per fermare il declino ammette: ""Ho fatto giusto qualche esame a legge"". Ma sui suoi curriculum online apparivano lauree in Giurisprudenza e Economia

Alla fine, Giannino ha confessato: non solo non ha mai conseguito un master in business administration alla Chicago Booth University. Una balla sono anche le sue lauree: quella in Economia e quella in Giurisprudenza che apparivano in diversi suoi curruculum online. ""Ho fato giusto qualche esame a legge"" ha spiegato il fondatore di Fare per fermare il declino a Enrico Mentana nel corso del tg di La7. ""Quello che so l'ho imparato per i fatti miei. D'altra parte, sono da decenni giornalista, non ho mai usato presunti titoli accademici, che non ho, per carriere che non mi competono"".

Il sospetto sulle aluree aveva cominciato a circolare qualche ora prima dell'ammissione di Giannino. Come riportato dal sito lettera43.it, la biografia del fondatore di ""Fare per fermare il declino"" sul sito dell’Istituto Bruno Leoni, fino a poco tempo fa riportava i suoi titoli in grande stile: ""È laureato in Giurisprudenza ed Economia e ha conseguito il diploma in Corporate Finance e Public Finance presso la University of Chicago Booth School of Business"". Dopo la denuncia di Luigi Zingales sul master a Chicago, invece, è stato cancellato tutto il paragrafo in un solo colpo. E insieme con il master si sono perse per strada anche le due lauree. E pure ""Il catalogo del Viventi"" di Giorgio Dell’Arti - che raccoglie le biografie di almeno 7 mila personaggi pubblici italiani - per esempio, non cita i titoli accademici del giornalista.

Per oggi, Giannino ha convocato la direzione generale del partito, alla quale offrirà la sua disponibilità a farsi da parte per il bene dell'immagine di ""Fermare il declino"".

Since then at the G20 they all promised to not purposely devalue their own currencies spreading problems overseas.  That's what all those with plateauing economies would like to do.  Yet since  the President of the Eurogroup's warning it's gotten even higher, as the UK is slowly bringing the pound down.

As it is France is swimming at the moment not with just retirees and UK holiday homes, but awash with UK tradesmen that have moved out for a different, more family orientated way of life.  Meanwhile, although this might sound arrogant, more European universities are electing to [English-taught courses](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9447458/Study-abroad-Where-to-study-in-Europe...-in-English.html?frame=2297247)!  Culturally it has reached critical mass.  Even without legal ruling it has become the predominantly default universal secondary language.

It's unfair to compare somebody complaining about housing benefits not keeping up with gentrification, and British people working overseas, which they actually do do, albeit if there are different motivators in place.  

That said I don't think this really addresses the actual point in that  somehow familiarity will lead to the UK adopting the Euro.  It's not like agreeing to go out on a date with someone.  You don't accept a currency because you're like hanging out with them.  The Conservatives used to be quite split on the Euro, like you said, but 1992 put pay to that.  Twenty years later and all still hasn't been forgiven, or forgot, it's more unpopular than ever, and given this latest crisis it'll be at least another 20 years, and that's if, and only if, there isn't another Euro crisis.  If they do prevent that from happening, by going down further centralisation and federalisation, then it becomes not just a matter of currency but a matter of real sovereignty for the UK.  Not just a 2017 referendum of in or out, but an additional referendum mandated by the 2011 UK European Union Act on whether to hand over more powers to Brussels.

true,DimReaper,UKGB,United Kingdom,"As a serving naval officer, I can say with some authority that you're either basing a lot of badly informed conjecture on a very small amount of knowledge, or just trolling. 

Even without the large escort screen that accompanies a carrier specifically to prevent a sub getting close, even without long range land based maritime patrol aircraft doing the same thing, even without friendly submarines doing the same thing, and even without any intelligence sources threat reducing hostile submarines, the carrier will usually still have ASW capability on board as part of its own air group. Submarine versus solo capital ship, submarine wins. Submarine versus ASW escort or another submarine, it can go either way (often the submarine's if one on one against a surface escort). Any kind of ASW aircraft versus submarine, the submarine will either die or be forced to abort attacks in favour of self preservation.

Submarines can and do kill carriers in exercises partly because exercises with live submarines are usually tailored to allow them to gain training value from their participation. If the submarine just spent eight hours constantly under attack from a virtually limitless train of 'for exercise' torpedoes while the carrier just cracked on into the distance pursuing its own tasking, it would be a pointless exercise for the submarine. Most exercises also allow platforms to continue playing after being 'killed' so as to provide training for both platforms, and to allow close range weapon teams a chance to train. They're dangerous bits of kit, and if used correctly COULD kill a carrier (though it would be a suicide attack against a capable battle group). Certainly if it was a surprise attack and there was no screen and nobody listening to sonar it would be an easy kill; but you could say the same thing about aircraft, or even a surface escort with a decent gun or heavyweight missile, and a lot of ammunition. But submarines are not the super weapons that you portray them as. If the carrier group is ready for action, which it would be in wartime or on operations against an enemy that posed a credible submarine threat, a submarine captain would have to be very good and very lucky to kill the carrier.

true,thomas_slothrop,basilicata,,"No guarda, adesso stai mischiando di tutto, e di fatto sei finito nella stessa ridicolaggine tipica di /r/MensRights.  
Al di là del femminismo, vero o presunto, in Italia abbiamo un problema di generi, causati da forti pregiudizi in entrambe le direzioni, e questo tuo atteggiamento, imho, è quello tipico che non fa che rafforzare i suddetti pregiudizi.  
Ma andiamo con ordine, partendo dal tuo primo commento:

* Una donna assassinata crea allarme sociale, un uomo assassinato no. Discriminazione? Di solito, no. Quando c'è un omicidio bisogna guardare al contesto sociale in cui l'omicidio è avvenuto: se ci sono due idioti che litigano per un parcheggio e uno dei due infila una lama sotto il plesso solatre dell'altro, c'è un contesto sociale da analizzare? Possiamo dire che questo omicidio è avvenuto a causa di pregiudizi o di un clima generale di violenza? Probabilmente no, a meno che le liti da parcheggio non inizino a sfornare decine di morti l'anno, non è un problema sociale. Mettiamo il caso in cui invece una donna cerca di lasciare il fidanzato e questo la riempie di pugni finché non smette di respirare. Possiamo dire che il contesto sociale c'entra in questo omicidio? La condizione della donna è ancora un problema in Italia? Se la società fosse modellata diversamente la violenza potrebbe essere stata evitata? Forse sì, forse no. Ovviamente non sto dicendo che ogni donna uccisa è vittima del maschilismo, né che ogni omicidio femminile rientra nella categoria fittizia e dai confini molto labili del ""femminicidio"", ma, numeri alla mano, come società ci dovremmo porre delle domande a riguardo, da qui nasce l'esigenza di allarmi sociali e flash mob.
* Precedenza nelle emergenze e affidamento negato ai padri: sono due facce della stessa medaglia, ovvero i rimasugli culturali delle società che ci hanno preceduto, quelle che vedono una donna come madre, che quindi va preservata rispetto agli uomini per la perpetuazione della specie, nonché curatrice per eccellenza della prole. Discriminazione? In genere, sì, e anche particolarmente odiosa nel caso degli affidamenti negati ai padri. Questa situazione è figlia della mentalità che relega la donna al ruolo materno, e per cambiarla bisogna cambiare la visione generale della donna nella nostra società. Stracciarsi le vesti e prendersela con le femministe è non solo inutile, ma anche nocivo alla causa.
* Consumazioni a metà prezzo alle donne: discriminazione? Nì. Ovvero: se è discriminazione, è perché ve la cercate. Basta non andare in un locale solo perché lì ""c'è più fica"", e basta non supportare economicamente locali che utilizzano politiche che non vi piacciono. Ma se la gente ci va lo stesso vuol dire che accetta la situazione e gli sta bene la discriminazione.
* Camere in affitto: discriminazione? Sì. In Italia spesso le soluzioni coabitative miste sono viste ancora con molta diffidenza, e spesso le donne vengono ritenute inquiline ideali perché pulite e responsabili (il ché, ovviamente, è una grande stronzata). Anche questo è frutto della nostra mentalità, che vede l'uomo come predatore sessuale e la donna come fragile essere in pericolo, per cui non puoi mettere nella stessa casa ragazzi e ragazze, contessa, sai che sconceria? Ho abitato in case miste, e non ci vedevo nulla di strano, ma pressocché tutti quelli che lo venivano a sapere si sentivano in dovere di fare battutine e immaginare situazioni tipo commedia sexy italiana degli anni '60.

Come dicevo tutte queste situazioni sono riconducibili allo stesso minimo comun denominatore: la disparità del trattamento dei sessi in Italia. Lavoriamo su questo, e il resto verrà da sé, sarà più facile superare le discriminazioni in ambedue le direzioni, ma per cortesia evitiamo, come uomini, di essere incazzati, perché appariamo altrimenti solo piccoli e spaventati da una realtà che non riusciamo a capire.

Transfer 49,999 €: you pay nothing or maybe 0.10 €, whatever your bank charges domestically. Transfer 50,001 €: Pay around 50 € for this transfer, usually split in half between sender and receiver like in the bad old times before SEPA / EU regulations.

2. Which payment systems get approved in a webshop, especially when dealing with international shipments. Vendors rather pay the credit card fee than risk getting burned by some fraud. Credit card companies guarantee for seller and buyer that in case anything is not right, they are protected.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Thats a very good point. Also modern forms of communication are making dialects disappear (or at least making them weaker) over here (sadly), so I doubt that america will ever develop as diverse dialects as found in some european countries. 

It's not really clear that this is the case. Mass media and the internet makes access to a standard language easier, but it also makes it much easier for non-standard dialects to be maintained across a long distance. A hundred years ago, if you moved from a rural village to a city, you'd probably never speak your rural dialect again once you adopted the (more standardized) city dialect. Nowadays, you can text or Skype your family and friends in your dialect, and many minority languages now have substantial internet resources.

&gt; Within an hour of where I live there are at least four different ways of saying ""I"".

It's worth pointing out that there is significant dialectal difference about how to say ""you"" in America, *especially* in the plural.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"I was in a similar situation after I graduated. In fact, I was cyclically in your situation for three years. There is even a possibility that I could end up back in your situation. 

I graduated in 2009. This was right in the middle of the worst parts of the recession (some might argue that it's still in recession). I had an internship after college that was suppossed to segue directly into a full time job. It didn't. I moved back to my home state and moved in with my sister. I was unemployed for probably five or six months, and had the same problem. Underqualified and inexperienced for an engineering job, and over-qualified for a regular shit job. The next two years I got jobs as a contract engineer, which basically means you work six months and then you're back on your ass again.

In between these periods of employment, were four months or so of depressing unemployment. I actually got a job delivering pizza the last time I was unemployed (I don't know how I got it honestly. I was actually wondering if I should lie on my applications and say I just got out of jail, and not mention that my last job was a good paying quality engineering job). After about three weeks of working there, I got offered the job I have now. The manager at the pizza restaurant was pissed off at me, and told me she would never hire anyone with a college degree again.

Anyhow, it's been 3 years of up and down with me since I finished school. I can finally say I have a good paying job, and my company's business prospects are actually great for the forseeable future (although, who really knows what can happen).

Honestly, just try not to feel shitty. It can be hard at times, especially when your other friends have jobs. Eventually something will turn up. If there are any local recruiters in the area, I suggest you look them up. Of the several hundred jobs I applied for over a three year span, I can honestly say that zero emailed me back. It's a complete waste of time applying on a company's website. I don't know how it works in the UK, but here in America, many companies are required to advertise jobs online.

I guess that's pretty relative in Munich. I think it's one of the if not the most expensive city when it comes to rent in Germany.

I have no personal experience with Munich, but if you want something cheaper you will probably end up with some shared apartment and probably also not exactly near the city center or university.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"I wish I could do that fancy linking-to-graphs  stuff, but the author addresses your question in the latter part of the article under this section:

&gt;**Financial Economy – Real Economy Split**

&gt;What is beyond doubt is that conditions in the financial economy have improved greatly. The government has opened a market for its debt, the banks have a solid capital base for 2013 and are able to access European wholesale funding markets – even if this is still at a considerable price in terms of interest paid. This is why Mr. de Guindos thinks the need for a bailout is receding.

&gt;But of course conditions in the real economy continue to deteriorate. Most estimates for 2013 are for a larger contraction than that estimated by the government (something which has become habitual), and many observers continue to expect the negative growth trend to continue in 2014. Unemployment was already over 26% as 2012 drew to a close, which makes 27.5% next December a virtual certainty and a number over 28% entering 2014 horrifyingly possible.

&gt;So despite all the positive “talking up” that Spain’s economy is receiving from well-wishers at the international level, the disconnect between the financial economy and the real one has now become markedly pronounced, and the clearest evidence for this is that what are now, at least for the time being, well capitalized banks are still unable to provide systematic credit to the deteriorating private sector.

Then he continues with:

&gt;One of the less well commented features of Spain’s boom during the early years of this century is the way the arrival of economic migrants fueled a significant part of GDP growth. The country’s population grew by more than 6 million (from 40 to 46 million) in the first eight years of the century, raising employment levels in both the formal and the informal economies.

&gt;Migrants are still arriving, but the balance has now turned negative. According to data from the National Statistics Office, **as of last September the net outflow was around 20,000 a month and accelerating. That is to say a quarter of a million a year, or a million every four years. And the final numbers will almost certainly be much larger.**

&gt;So a country which already doesn’t have enough people working to pay for its pension system, now faces having less and less as time goes by, while the number of pensioners looking to claim will only grow and grow. In part that is the end result of sitting back and watching a 1.3 child per woman fertility rate for over 30 years.

&gt;But to this grave underlying problem is now being added a new and potentially more deadly one. Those leaving are not only migrants who came earlier. **Increasingly young educated Spanish people are upping and leaving, and unlike in earlier periods many who go now will never return. Not only is there a massive human capital loss involved here, trend GDP growth is evidently being reduced as the workforce steadily shrinks, while all those unsellable surplus-to-requirement houses become even less sellable.** And so we may go on in what has all the hallmarks of a non too virtuous circle. So next time Luis de Guindos proudly proclaims that economic conditions are improving, he might care to consider stopping for a moment to reflect on the possibility, nay the almost certain reality, that Spain’s economic contraction now feeds on itself.

At this point, I am just doing a poor job of copying, pasting, adding emphasis, and omitting important charts. But basically everything after the section I highlighted above goes into the depressing details. Whether or not you agree with the author, I'll leave that up to you.

&gt;Hinter jedem Bundeswehrsoldaten im Einsatz stünden 35 Soldaten und 15 zivile Mitarbeiter in Deutschland im Grundbetrieb und zur Unterstützung, berichtet die ""Wirtschaftswoche"" weiter. 

&gt;Bei den Franzosen seien es acht Soldaten und zwei zivile Mitarbeiter, bei den Briten neun und vier, EU-weit 16 und vier. Die Ausgaben pro Soldat im Einsatz lägen bei 5,16 Millionen Euro und damit dreimal so hoch wie im EU-Durchschnitt.

Man fragt sich, wo dieses Geld eigentlich hingeht, denn bei den Soldaten kommt es garantiert nicht an. Dort fehlt es vielmehr an allem, von Bekleidung über Fahrzeuge bis hin zu Fernmeldeeinrichtungen. 

&gt; Gerade die Beschaffung von gepanzerten Fahrzeugen, Helikoptern, Schutzwesten und Munition wird in der Truppe scharf kritisiert, weil es stets sehr lange dauert, bis das für den Auslandseinsatz benötigte Material am Einsatzort vorhanden ist. Soldaten im Auslandseinsatz empfinden die Bürokratie, die zahllosen Vorschriften und Anträge als Gefährdung ihrer Mission.

it's painful, and don't expect to work doing what you studied either, you have to just get something with which you can live, even if just barely, degrees are laughably useless unless you go to another country where you can have a future, there's actually a [gyro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyro_\(food\)) restaurant near where I live whose owner is using photocopies of his degree to wrap around the gyros, I always found that funny

if you do get a job, feel lucky if you're getting paid, my mom is still owed about 9k euros from her former job, most of that is unpaid wages, and she is not alone, many businesses aren't paying people but are still expecting you to go every day like normal

all in all I think the best option for people is to either leave the country or get a job online, by that I mean youtube or a blog/site and live with that, I tried it myself but I suck at everything I do so nothing came from it, I'm just leeching off whatever money my dad makes and hoping for brighter days",0,1361326898,null,0,false,0,c8i79rc,t3_18tvrw,t1_c8i79rc,t1_c8hx4er,null,1431346155,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Meaning there is no human life, no soul, no people, an emptiness void of all of that, cats are just a thing.

true,DimReaper,UKGB,United Kingdom,"... All subs are stealth subs. There wouldn't be much point in one that was deliberately noisy and visible, it'd just be a small, comparatively poorly armed ship. There has always and will always be a shifting balance between which is better, a submarine or a sonar set, that's why sonar fits are regularly updated and modified. It's exactly the same as stealthy aircraft versus radar, they aren't magical and most decent military radar could still pick them up if tuned and operated correctly. The hard part is telling a small return from background clutter without also tracking every seagull in the sky or fish in the sea at the same time. it's still perfectly doable with the right equipment and well trained and alert people though, just difficult.

The job of detecting a submarine is also made much easier by the manoeuvring tactics used when you know a submarine might be out there. A submarine sitting on the bottom on batteries is VERY quiet and hard to detect. It's also no more useful for killing ships than a mine, just millions of times more expensive. If it's forced to steam at fifteen knots to get into a firing position, then come to the surface for a quick look with an attack scope, it loses most of that advantage.

Finally, sonar isn't the only way of detecting a submarine, or even necessarily the best way.

She said that, yes, *technically* it was possible, but rare, and those who did it were usually her ""problem clients"".",0,1361347654,null,0,false,0,c8id3e0,t3_18u3z8,t1_c8id3e0,t1_c8i5twq,null,1431349117,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

So, it is mostly used for what we catch ourselves.

If you are going to smoke fish, you get the best results from fat fishes, like salmon, eel (but please, not European eel, it is protected), herring etc. You always ""clean"" the fish beforehand, but if the fish is really big, you can just smoke the filé. We hardly ever did that though, because the skin is good to leave on, it keeps the moisture inside. That also means that the thicker skin, the better. 

You prepare it first (clean it, as soon as you catch it), and then salt it for at least a few hours. If it's a slimy fish, you might want to - ""de slime"" it first. Then you smoke it. It usually takes something between 2-5 hours. Depending on the taste you want, you use different sort of wood, but we usually did not use coniferous trees.  Obviously, you can also get it more or less smokey, depending if you choose ""smokey"" wood. 

It is hard to explain, what do you want to know? ",0,1361347694,null,0,false,0,c8id3m0,t3_18vgci,t1_c8id3m0,t1_c8icx3u,null,1431349119,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,Fedcom,CANA,Canada,"I'm an Indian immigrant to Canada, just would like to give my two cents. 

I think Canadian people are genuinely nicer and warmer to strangers. People go out of their way to help you out, apologize profusely if they inconveniance you, have no qualms about making friendly conversation on a bus or something.   
Whereas in India the general idea is to be deeply distrustful towards strangers. Everyone is suspicious and you take what's yours in the public space. You don't apologize when you cut someone off to get on the train, you feel proud that you got a spot. There are many people there and everyone is in a competition. 

However, towards family and friends, Canadians are colder. In India, its an obligation to offer someone food and something to drink when they walk in the door. In Canada, its considered a favour. Non-immigrant Canadians tend to only see their extended family a few times a year for the big holidays. Neighbours rarely interact outside of helping each other shovel or making small-talk. 

Obviously a generalization, but thats what I noticed. Relationships tend to be strong within the immediate family unit though. ",0,1361348466,null,0,false,0,c8id7pe,t3_18qqv4,t1_c8id7pe,t1_c8helrd,null,1431349179,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
