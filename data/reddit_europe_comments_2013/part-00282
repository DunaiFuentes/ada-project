I am 26/F. I just recently had a discussion with my friend about this, if there are differences in dating between generations and we agreed on this:

Well...there is no ""casual dating"" with multiple people and then deciding whether or not go exclusive (this is how I understand the USA 
way). If you do it like that, you are considered douche and cheater.

One/two dates = getting to know each other.

Dating = relationship

When it comes to meeting people, or date  planning, its as diverse as it can be,  as everywhere. 

We usually dont do long distance dating. It is 6 hour drive from one side of our country to another, so we see traveling somewhere for more than 1 hour as going far away. We usually date someone from our city, or nearby....living in dorms is other thing :)

And there is no general rule about when to have sexy times (but there used to be something like that...that it is best to way for, maybe 2 months? Dont know the whole reasoning behind that)

Thanks to our history and recent developement, we have our fair share of religious no-sex people VS. shameless sluts,  but generally, we are mainly good mannered, good looking people :)))

My ancestors are from Niedersachsen/Hannover (I think to be literal, Hannover, as that's where the last name still is found today amongst other places). The name is Spoor (my Grandpa's mom's surname and her family who came from Germany). Names that are similar to it are Spühr, Spoer, Spöer, Speer...Etc - I've seen quite a few different spellings. Anyways, this is where my interest comes from. Of course I'd want to visit all the touristy areas and cities too, like Hamburg and Berlin. I know a few people in Hamburg and they've requested I visit whenever it happens.

I'm also a history student at one of Canada's best universities and I *love* history, and Germany has an incredible history. The 19th and 20th centuries are amongst my favourite because it starts with the Napoleonic Wars and Prussia, then leads to WW1 and 2.

I'm aware Germans have difficulty discussing these periods but regardless I find them fascinating. Not really sure why Germany always gets blamed for starting WW1 because it certainly wasn't them - however they were just as full of angst as any nation who fought. That war was a display of how dangerous absolutism is. In WW1 I choose to believe the only ""bad guys"" were the enemy of your nation. It's honestly the last war in history which was purely based on monarchs wanting power, just like some sort of Medieval or Renaissance war - truly the last of its kind. It's so interesting because WW1 was at its simplest the prediction of who would rule the world with more strength - Austria, Germany, and their friends, or the Brits, the Russians, and their friends.

WW2 is a different story altogether, but there are so many interesting points to it. My family participated fully in both World Wars, 5 ancestors in each. Another reason for my interests.

If a kid takes Advanced Placement European History, he learns about the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  I vaguely remember covering that in high school, which is the last stage of childhood education in the US. Otherwise, nothing except perhaps a mention in Geography class.

Note that this information is dated.  I've been out of high school for a long time.  Given that US primary education now focuses almost exclusively on preparing children to take standardized tests, I don't think coverage of Austrian history has expanded since my days in school.

At university, you'd have to choose to take classes that deal with Austrian history, culture, or politics.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"Alas, Prestian has made a few mistakes but has got the gist of it. 

Historically, the European Commission (EC) President has been proposed by the European Council (the Council of Europe is something else), which is the heads of ~~states~~ government of the member-states. This choice then has to be ratified by the European Parliament (EP), but they're also free to reject the choice if the choice is not good enough. The EC president then creates his cabinet (the EC) who the EC president proposes once more to be ratified by the EP. So at every stage, they're being chosen by people you've elected. This is set to change, as per Prestian's post

Technically, in the UK, you don't vote for the executive either. The governing party/coalition gets to choose who makes up the executive, so this is fundamentally on a comparable level of democracy to the UK.

The President of the European Parliament is chosen by a majority in the EP. This has historically been split by the two largest parties, who have been cooperating for some two dozen years.

The ECJ has their judges appointed rather than elected, as in many countries. If the ECJ finds something to be contrary to EU law, then it is contrary to the national law of the member state, by virtue of the treaties that have been signed by the member states (thus making those treaties part of national law).

If you're referring to the EU interfering with referendums, it can't really, beyond some marketing of itself. The EU has no power to call for referendums, nor does it have power to remove heads of state.

Everyone had a score to settle. No one ever rushed forward to forgive thy enemy. Especially when your enemy tries to disassemble you for black market organ trafficking, then gets backing from a certain global geopolitical player and is allowed to create enclaves in your own country.

Well it comes down to the central bank. They can raise the money supply without a corresponding rise in GDP, but doing so will generally cause their currency to slip against others if they do not raise interest rates at the same time. To a certain extent, Central Banks can and do attempt to manipulate their exchange rates (typically for stabilisation) by themselves participating in the foreign exchange market but this can be quite expensive.

In this case money is being poured into economies with severe problems, with few constraints and no oversight. How do we know that it will not go straight out again? This is a high risk strategy.

&gt; Putin seems like a pretty smart guy.

He isn't. He has surrounded himself with so many ""yes-men"" that however smart he started off as, without the challenges inherent in an active cabinet, he is making mistakes. So far he has been able to throw money at them, but reserves are being depleted.

&gt;I'm sure he understands that he can't just keep depending on Oil/Gas sales.

Does he? He has seriously impeded the development of companies on a normal commercial basis since he came to power. This has happened by too much power being vested into state bodies without adequate controls, hence the abuses where security and tax officials are involved in the confiscation of businesses for their personal benefit. A corrupt state means that you want to keep your business small and portable.

Une entreprise détruit aussi des emplois, une entreprise qui réussit à produire 10+2 de tel biens avec 5 personnes, contre une entreprise qui produit 10 avec 11, va détruire 6 emplois. Après c'est une bonne chose pour la productivité, mais c'est une autre histoire pour le chômeur.

La norme de dépense de l'Etat est ""constante"" depuis 3 ans, donc les impôts qui financent les contrat aidé se font au détriment d'autres dépenses = ça ne change rien. Les charges elles augmentent (quoique assez peu au final) mais c'est la Sécu, pas l'Etat qui le décide. Sécu dont le CA est composé paritairement des syndicats professionnels et des chefs d'entreprises....

Ce n'est pas l’État qui crée les chômeurs c'est notre situation économique, à moins de mettre nos niveaux de salaires/protection sociale au rang de la Somalie et avec tout ce que cela suppose comme déflation je ne vois pas ce qu'on peut faire avec l'Euro et la compétition allemande.


td;lr : C'est complètement faux de dire qu'un gvt ne peut pas créer d'emploi, alors qu'une entreprise peut. Le but d'un système économique n'étant que la distribution des richesse produite vers un optimum définit comme le bien être commun (Pareto) que ce soit les entreprises qui s'en chargent où l'Etat ou les deux aux final c'est pareil. Après la question est de savoir le quel système est le plus efficace (a de meilleur résultats) si il semble que ce soit celui où le secteur privé prédomine, force est de constater qu'en terme d'IDH les pays ""mixte"" où le public joue un très grand rôle s'en sortent bien mieux. Les système économique est un monde ""finit"", si il y a 80% d'un côté, et 20% de l'autre c'est qu'on prend du côté des 20 pour mettre du côté des 80, toute richesse se fait au détriment d'une autre.

* Meeting people in bars. When I was younger, 20 something, I solely found relationships from bars, usually things started from a one night stand and grew from that. Nowadays I don't bother anymore hitting random good-looking/good-looking-when-you-are-drunk girls because there is just too much hassle and o-for-fuck-sakes moments. However many of my friends, both male and female, still do it.
* Meeting people via on-line dating. This is my preferred way to date. I have my profile in two different services. The good thing about using on-line dating services that I can filter out both too young and too old, not to mention can make sure that the girl has finished her university studies and looks pretty enough. Its has been a good way to meet random people that I would have otherwise met: manager/director, consultants, doctor, teacher, journalist, opera singer, etc... It has been fun and it is relaxed way to get to know people. I usually am in contact and date multiple people in the same time, and the girls do it too. If with somebody things move to more serious, then we agree to start seeing each other solely.

By the way few notices...

* The person with whom things have moved into more serious level has actually been a girl that studied in the same university, in the same time, for the same degree... And we never met there, it felt very bizarre and interesting when we found out that we had so much in common.

It’s valid for one day on all local trains in Bavaria and it costs €23 for one person plus €4 for every additional person (up to five). It’s also valid for some public transit, depending on the city. In Munich, for example, this ticket is valid in S-Bahn, U-Bahn, Tram and busses.

There are only two things you have to be careful about:

1. On weekdays it’s valid from 9am to 3am, so you can’t use trains super early. On weekends it’s valid from midnight to 3am the following day.

2. The ticket is only valid in regional/local trains, no intercity trains. Intercity trains are usually white with a red stripe and are called ICE, IC or EC. As far as I can tell there is only a EC going from Munich to Traunstein and it’s only ten minutes faster than the regional trains, so this is not a big problem for you. Just take care to not take the EC.

&gt;Cinnamon is one of the most important flavoring agents in foods and drinks, team leader Ikhlas Khan explained. It is the second most popular spice, next to black pepper, in the United States and Europe.

&gt;Ceylon cinnamon, also known as ""true cinnamon"" (cinnamon verum) is very expensive. Therefore, most foods in the USA and Western Europe, including sticky buns, breaks and other products use the cheaper Cassia cinnamon (dried Cassia bark).

&gt;True cinnamon has very little coumarin, unlike Cassia cinnamon. A 2010 German study found that on average, Cassia cinnamon powder had up to 63 times more coumarin compared to Ceylon cinnamon powder, while Cassia cinnamon sticks contained 18 times more than Ceylon cinnamon sticks.

Where can I find a place to live?

If you are after a short-term contract - 3 months or so whilst you search for a place, then the first place to try is a ""Mitwohnzentrale"". These are agencies that sub-let apartments or rooms in apartments on a short-term basis for their owners. This is usually enough to keep you going whilst you look for a more permanent place.

These sites have listings for individual flats

What Must I Know About Renting?

A rental contract (""Mietvertrag"") is either fixed-term or open-ended. In either case, you will have a time-table of fixed rent increases every year. Termination of your contract will usually have a 3-month notice period. You will have to pay a deposit - usually 1-3 months rent - which will be returnable upon the end of your contract unless you are deemed to have caused damage to the property. This money will be placed in a separate account by your landlord. Note that it is possible to ""borrow"" against this deposit at some banks, but avoid doing so, as the terms are not generous. Note that while you live in the property, you are responsible for reporting any damage or problems to the landlord, so they can fix them. If you do not, you may lose your deposit. If you do report the problems and your landlord does not fix them promptly, you may be entitled to a rent reduction. (see Mietverein)German law used to require tenants to leave the place ""as found"", usually requiring that you redecorated the place before you leave. This is no longer the case, however it can count in your favour.Be careful about the quotations for your apartment/flat (""Wohnung""). In Germany, prices are quoted ""cold"" and ""warm"" - eg cold water and warm water. Make sure that you have a good idea about additional charges - some places will have extra charges for ""Müll"" (garbage removal), heating, etc that can come as a bit of a shock. These are usually calculated once a year and sent to you.

Mietverein

It is also a good idea to become a member of a ""Mietverein"" - Renter's Union. This is a body which can advise you upon your rights as a tenant and any problems you may have.


What's all this about Kitchens?!

Strange as it may seem, Germans are very attached to their kitchens, and will often take the kitchen with them when they move. This means you're probably going to have to buy a kitchen when you rent a place. Sometimes you can buy the kitchen from the previous tenant. Either way, be prepared to fork out for one. Complete kitchens or components can be bought from Ikea (take the 5 out to Ossendorf) Bauhaus (at Barbarossa pl) and Max Bahr (Ehrenfeld, near the Music Halle). Second-hand kitchens can be found in the ""kleinanzeige"" in Köln Stadt Anzeiger or www.kalaydo.de. There are also a number of 2nd-hand appliance firms which will sell you a cooker / washing machine / dishwasher. NOTE that you must get the cooker connected by a professional electrician. All flats will have an electrical cutoff, usually by the electric meter. Make sure you know where this is. Note that this cutoff isn't a fuse box (like in older UK houses) but a trip switch. These operate by detecting loss of power from the circuit. If you are getting a repeat trip-out on any electrical circuits, get your caretaker to get an electrician in immediately. In my case, the people next door were getting electric shocks from their water, and the electrician found there were absolutely NO earths in the kitchen!

Ah..Electric. What do I do about that?

You will have to register with a power supply company - the easiest is the local utility company. You will need the the meter reading of the day you move in. To be on the safe side make sure you get that together with your landlord. You can register either online or go to their service centre. Pay close attention to the letter you get from them telling you the monthly fees. If your flat has electrical water boilers, or was used by a Wohngemeinschaft, then the electrical use as estimated by them may be ridiculously high. On the other hand it might be too low, leaving you with a large back-dated payment at the end of the year. If you are adventurous, you have a choice of electrical supplier, even though the savings aren't that high (maximum 40 EUR a year). Bear in mind that some suppliers have been running a ""hard sell"" campaign (RWE) where they send people round to talk you into a ""quote"", and then you find out, when the company phones, that you have agreed to swap. 

How do I register once I have a place?

All citizens are required to register their current address at the ""Einwohnermeldeamt"". http://www.stadt-koeln.de/buergerservice/themen/anmelden-ummelden/meldehallen-und-kundenzentrum/ Take your passport and rental contract. You will receive a copy of your registration. Keep it safe, and make several copies of it. You may be asked to produce it as proof of your place of residence. You will also have to register at the ""Aüslanderamt"" (Alien Office). If you are a European Citizen, you will receive a stamped letter which grants you equivalent rights to a native citizen. Keep this safe with your passport, as it is your proof of residency. If you are not a European Citizen, you will be granted a limited stay ""green card"". Your employer may have already sponsored you, in which case they will help you through the application process. Green Cards typically last 5 years and may, or may not, be renewable depending on the circumstances. Depending on economic circumstances, green cards may be difficult to come by or renew. For example, after the dotcom crash, many expatriates were refused extensions on their green cards.

Let's say, for instance, that guy A from Madrid thinks more religion credits should be added to primary school curriculum. At this point, very few communities, like Euskadi, can just override that poor decission. But it's the same with national roads, trains or whatever: people just ask the ongoing national government to build more infrastructures.

Of course this may lead us to some weird discrepancies, but let's be honest, what Madrid says is not always what other government's want.

Another example would be the new abortion law, or the ad hoc protection for bullfighting events. Central government is just messing with sentiments, trying to regulate over whatever citizens think or say. Right now, courts are so broken you cannot try to appeal against those unfair laws, because most judges have some kind of political affinity.

In my case, and maybe my case only, I found that suddendly, some education law that guaranteed children to learn and speak galician, a law which worked flawlessly for about 20 years, is considered harmful to the idea of ""unity"". Oddly enough, that law was passed by the PP in the 80s.

E' l'Italia un Paese in cui la maggioranza della gente non è e non è mai stata di sinistra? Sì. E' questo il risultato della retorica anticomunista della Dc? No. O meglio: non solo. Perché prima che nella propaganda della Dc, le cause di questo fenomeno vanno cercate in fattori più radicati nella storia (una parola: Chiesa), in dinamiche politiche precedenti (la parabola social-rivoluzionaria dei primi vent'anni del Novecento che va dai blocchi al biennio rosso getta le fondamenta di una sfiducia diffusa nei confronti dell'idea stessa di sinistra), in tratti sociali profondi dell'Italia (come l'interclassismo). Una volta che si ha un quadro più generale della questione e si ha un'idea della proporzione tra le grandezze degli elementi in gioco si può iniziare a vedere quanto e come ha influito in tutto questo la retorica democristiana sul pericolo rosso.

E la risposta, per l'appunto, è che pur avendo lasciato tracce molto profonde a livello di memoria collettiva (aiutati dal fatto di essere stati i primi a camminare su media relativamente di massa, pezzi di propaganda tipo [""Nel segreto della cabina Dio ti vede, Stalin no""](http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/a1948t.jpg) oppure [""Mamma, votagli contro anche per me""](http://www.maremagnum.com/uploads/item_image/image/2245/100000-prigionieri-italiani-sono-tornati-dalla-russia-6b9f58b3-aac7-48b6-b7b5-c1bf0ed3a95d.jpeg) sono diventati patrimonio comune), la retorica dc sul pericolo rosso alla fine risulta essere un fenomeno accessorio. Intanto perché si tratta di qualcosa la cui durata è molto limitata nel tempo: la fase hardcore della Dc diga anticomunista dura sì e no quindici anni: dalla campagna elettorale del '48 (cui non va dimenticato che si arriva quando la Dc ha smesso di governare insieme al Pci da nemmeno due anni e di farci insieme la Costituzione da nemmeno due mesi) ai primi anni '60. L'ostilità vera, in realtà, dura solo fino alla fine della prima Legislatura (picchi massimi su Patto atlantico e riforma agraria). Nel '53, infatti, succedono due cose che portano la Dc ad ammorbidire la pregiudiziale anti-sinistra (che non è ancora la pregiudiziale anti-comunista ma è già qualcosa): De Gasperi che liscia il premio di maggioranza per un niente e muore per il dispiacere e Fanfani che [brevetta la macchina del fango](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caso_Montesi), rottama il povero Piccioni e inizia la scalata al partito. Punto primo del fanfanismo è il superamento della fase centrista alla De Gasperi e l'apertura al Psi a scopo centrosinistra normale prima e organico poi (senso della cosa: già che devo essere tenuto per le palle, meglio che mi ci tenga un partito medio piuttosto che tre piccoli). 

Dunque già a partire dai primi '60 assistiamo ad un cambiamento nel modo di porsi della Dc di fronte all'entità-sinistra. Certo, il comunismo resta il Male, e ogni volta che la cronaca lo consentirà (tipo Praga '68) si menerà senza pietà. Però al contempo c'è da far digerire all'elettorato l'apertura a sinistra, quindi si rispolverano le profonde radici sociali della Dc, quindi la sinistra del partito (cioè Forze Nuove) inizia a dare la linea sul welfare, quindi ci si distanzia platealmente da liberali e repubblicani (da questi ultimi con grande piacere, dato che il vero nemico per la Dc è sempre stata la massoneria, altro che comunisti). Suppergiù dieci anni di centrosinistra e siamo nei '70, quando nella Dc si gettano le basi per lo sdoganamento del Pci mediante compromesso storico e quando, complice anche l'avviato disfacimento dell'Urss, la funzione stessa della Dc come diga anticomunista inizia a non avere più senso. Curiosamente, questo succede in concomitanza di un decennio che vede per la prima e unica volta ribaltarsi il paradigma del Paese non di sinistra: mai come nei '70 il vento dell'opinione pubblica è ricettivo al fascino della sinistra, parlamentare e non: questo genererà fenomeni grotteschi (tipo il caso, unico al mondo, della buona borghesia con l'estratto conto in due volumi ma anche con la lacrimuccia di commozione pev quei bvigatisti così vomantici) ma anche un Pci stabile per un sacco di anni al 30%: l'onda lunga di questo trend porterà (decisivo l'aiutino della morte di Berlinguer), il Pci a fare il famoso sorpasso sulla Dc alle Europee dell'84. Da lì poi inizia il riflusso, il Paese si riposiziona al centro e l'anticomunismo esce di scena (a meno che non si voglia considerare anticomunismo quello che arriverà con Berlusconi, ma non sarebbe tanto serio).

In conclusione: la propaganda anticomunista della Dc c'è stata ed è stata incisiva, però non ha formato l'ostilità diffusa alla sinistra. Si è limitata ad appoggiarsi ad un sentimento già esistente e già radicato, gli ha fornito un codice e delle parole d'ordine, lo ha sfruttato e lo ha fatto prosperare. Ma, pur con tutto il bene che gli si può volere, sostenere che gli italiani non votino a sinistra per via di Guareschi è sopravvalutarlo un po'.",0,1388142104,null,0,false,0,ceb39kj,t3_1trdl4,t1_ceb39kj,t1_ceb1qi5,null,1427970545,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

Yep. The Telegraph story seems mangled: for example claims that it is the amount of cinnamon that is being regulated to 15 mg/kg (or 50 mg/kg) when it's not. Actually the regulation is not about the amount of cinnamon but limiting the amount of the toxin cumarin in foodstuff. 

As real cinnamon has much lower cumarin content compared to the Chinese cassia, one can reduce the amount of cumarin in foodstuff by using real cinnamon instead of el cheapo cassia with its toxin. Actual cinnamon is also more aromatic and tastes better than cassia - although that may be matter of taste.

I'm only venturing a guess here but the attachment in general (not just in England) might be to Elizabeth rather than the monarchy, whom a lot of people seem to respect, and whose reign goes back to a time when the monarchy probably had more affection. The Australian position once espoused by [Julia Gillard](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10995425) backs this up a little, who effectively said Australia should be a Republic, but not until the Queen dies.

I abhor the idea of the monarchy myself (I'm English), and to be honest it surprises me that it isn't a bigger issue in Scotland. Historically countries don't tend to get rid of their monarchy on a whim, it requires a big event (such as a war, revolution, coup etc). But a referendum on independence is a big event.

true,phys1cs,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Might I suggest that you probably have more ground in common than you're saying. You probably both think that it's bad for people to be poisoned by their food. You would probably both agree that consuming too much of this cinnamon is unhealthy, even if you don't agree on what 'too much' means. You would probably both agree that we should study the foods we eat to determine whether they are capable of causing harm, and if they are then people should ensure that the amounts they consume should be safe. Both of you will probably agree that there should be laws against selling the most dangerous things as food (milk contaminated with poison, meat that can cause infection even if handled and cooked properly etc), or at the very least some mechanism by which people are able clearly to identify food that is harmful (or food that has been certified not to be harmful). 

All that you're arguing about are the mechanisms by which food is labelled potentially harmful, and by which people are prevented from consuming excessive amounts of this food. Is it enough for the state to provide information on food safety (setting levels, ensuring adequate labeling, making people aware of the risks), or should it also be preventing people from making the informed decision to consume these items? Or would it perhaps be a better idea to focus on informing people first, and only consider a ban if it's still clear that public health is suffering despite people being better informed?

For that matter, is it right for things to be banned purely on the precautionary principle, despite a lack of evidence that the thing causes harm? This tends to be standard EU practice, but if the bans cause further harm (by hurting local economies, damaging traditional culture, wasting resources on pointless bureaucracy) the net impact could well be negative. Is it right to ban cinnamon for everyone when the evidence suggests only certain sensitive individuals may be harmed? By that reasoning, you could ban all nuts, fish and dairy.

Donc merci de ne pas parler de fantasme, ce que je dis est appuyé sur des auteurs que tu m'as toi même suggérés.

&gt;Rome n'a pas voulu reconnaître la légitimité des demandes en 1789

D'une part, les demandes de 1789 ne sont pas celles du peuple mais bien des bourgeois, la littérature sur le sujet est déjà largement abondante. Pas étonnant que la [milice bourgeoise](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garde_nationale_(France\)#Cr.C3.A9ation) aille ensuite tirer sur le peuple qui refuse de payer et de mourir pour les riches, et qui défend ses évêques après le scandale de la [confiscation des biens de l'Église](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignat#Confiscation_des_biens_du_clerg.C3.A9), destinés à rembourser les prêts consentis aux bourgeois. Celui qui défend le peuple, Robespierre, sera d'ailleurs [contre la déchristianisation](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#L.27.C3.8Atre_supr.C3.AAme).

Ensuite, c'est bien antérieur à ça. À un moment il va falloir accepter que la France a une histoire vieille de plus de mille ans, et qu'elle a développé sa propre vision des liens entre religieux et politique, avec par exemple le [gallicanisme](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallicanisme), puis la séparation de l'Église et de l'État de 1905.

&gt;But scientists have now discovered that too much of the most commonly used type of cinnamon, cassia, can cause liver damage thanks to high levels of coumarin, a natural ingredient found in the spice. Experts now recommend a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.1mg of coumarin per kg of body weight per day.

If governments are able to control the way history is taught, there is a risk that they will use history as a tool to justify political positions. It is better for students (of every age) to be exposed to different ideas and different arguments. This helps students be able to think for themselves.

Real cinnamon does not contain cumarin as you can read from your linked paper. One can make, eat and sell  cinnamon foodstuff using real cinnamon without worrying about food being toxic. 

But unfortunately instead of real cinnamon many use cassia which contains cumarin. Cassia is cheap, toxic and doesn't taste as good as real cinnamon. Yet many call it cinnamon instead of what it is: cassia.

I have no problem with toxins in foodstuff being regulated. And in this case the toxin is avoidable: use real cinnamon instead of toxic cassia. Or use less cassia to keep the level of toxin in check.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"In previous elections the council of ministers has appointed the European Commission. the Council of the European Union is a body made up of the heads of government of every single EU state. So basically Angela Merkel, David Cameron, François Hollande and all the other prime ministers and presidents (where appropriate) have a talk and will mostly agree on who to appoint. I forget whether this is done by majority voting couned by heads of government or by the EU's special weighted voting method which takes the population of the country the head of government is representing into account. 

This is how it used to be done, but even then you can see that Farage's claims that it is undemocratic is just a bit facetious. EU heads of state who are all directly elected elect the European Commission. It's very similar to how the prime minister is elected in the UK. You vote for your MP who then votes for the prime minister. Like wise, you vote for your head of state (maybe by voting for an MP) who then, later on, votes for the Commission President. 

Farage's argument that this was undemocratic was that your head of government's job is so far removed from deciding who the commission president is, that it is still undemocratic, despite being appointed by democratic institutions. And he does have a point. National politicians almost never say what Commission president they plan on voting for, but on the whole I still disagree with his claim that it is actually undemocratic. 

How the system works now is that the Council of Ministers (Cameron, Hollande, Merkel and so on) get together and decide who they want to be in the European Commission, then the European Parliament can simply veto it. The EU Parliament is a directly elected organ as you'll probably now and is directly associated with European affairs. In effect the EP could just keep rejecting proposals from the Council of Ministers until they finally suggested the Commissioners they wanted in the first place. 

Edit: I should note the reason why I give so much time talking about the 'old' method is because the new method (the one involving the EP) has not been used yet but will be used in the European elections in 2014.

There has been some rebuilding of the older ones but not as much as there should have been. And yes, there's been several arrests and prosecutions of people who were involved in these acts, and again not as many as there should've been. These acts not only got individuals in trouble but Kosovo in it's entirety since now people would think that we're ""savages who destroy religious places"". 

I know that there's been new constructions of orthodox churches in Kosovo who were actually inaugurated by the ministers of the Republic of Kosovo.

&gt;I mean, i'm not saying there aren't idiots on our side, but saying ""yeah we've changed so much and become enlightened, it's those damn peace hating Serbs causing all the trouble"" is disingenuous at best.

You're absolutely right, but the point of the article in its entirety was exactly that. Remind people that Kosovars destroyed churches back in those times without taking into account the current situation. I'm not saying we hit enlightenment but there are processes underway which have taken us forward in small but significant steps.

* Don't talk to anyone except the people you are travelling with. If you are conversing, don't be loud.
* Don't look at anyone except the people you are travelling with for more than 5 seconds. Ideally, stare out the window for the entire journey.
* Don't use more than one seat.
* Don't answer a phone call. If you're on the phone when you enter, end the conversation ASAP. If you are talking loudly, the other passengers have the right to give you the evil eye.
* DON'T MAKE ANY NOISE. Seriously. If you are listening to music, have it on low volume so that the sound doesn't leak out of your headphones, and refrain from any singing along except light lipsyncing.
* It's OK to sleep, but please, for the love of god, don't snore. If you know you have a tendency to snore, stay awake as well as you can. Maybe have a cup of coffee.
* Drinking is OK, eating is not. We don't want to see lettuce coming out of your sandwich, crumbs from your bread on the floor, or noodles from your Chinese takeaway all over the place.
* Don't sit down unless you're going further than three stops (or are otherwise unable to stand).
* If you're not talking to anyone actively, your expression should be relaxed and neutral. Don't look excessively happy, angry, or sad.
* Only bring small children on board if they are asleep or otherwise quiet. DO NOT BRING STROLLERS ON AT RUSH HOUR.
* If a person who is unable to stand comes on and approaches your seat, stand up immediately. Otherwise, everyone is allowed to stare at you for the rest of your journey.
* Don't look over people's shoulders. Seriously.
* Unless you are unable to stand or it's rush hour, don't sit next to someone, especially on the bus.

I had planned for this to only be three or four points, but it ended up being quite a lot longer than that. Oh well. Hope you enjoyed this ~~rant~~ list of rules.

EDIT: Thanks to /u/WideAwakeNotSleeping for this one:

* Don't get on if other people are waiting to come out.

true,iamnotaneffinfanboy,KOSV,Kosovo,"&gt;Is there a secularist movement in Kosovo? Or interfaith human rights projects? 

First one, not really. Second one, there's something but it's not publicized as it is not a pressing matter. Religion in Kosovo is not an issue. Of course there are small groups of individuals who try to convey Islamism in a harsher way but they are limited and their actions are closely monitored not to escalate. The majority of the population, even though is declared as Muslim, they don't adhere to principles that guide Islamism, and they know that, but rakia (shout out to Serbs here) is very good for a country with a lot of problems :P
&gt; It would be nice to have pictures from today that shows churches, mosques etc. cleaned up and people of different ethnic backgrounds working together to improve their neighbourhoods

Not pictures, but there's KFOR who does these videos once in a while as public campaigns and they have not been met with good reception since they border on cynicism. There should be a better method to represent this.

In biology those are going to be similar things.

Because these are important basics for biology as a science and a lot of people agree that everyone should have at least a basic grasp of these things.

In History however it is much harder to find some common ground on what is important and what is not. Of course there might be things that are universaly important for all europeans like the two World Wars as they had some effect on everyone (arguably even in the entire world). But already the french revolution might not be as important in Eastern Europe as in Western Europe. 

And as a Swiss we of course cover the most important parts of WW I + II and get an overview of what happend. But we mostly focus on how did we get throught the WWs without beeing attacked and how this events lead to the Switzerland we live in today. People outside of Switzerland may be interested in this, but a greek does not really need to know this. It simply does not yield any benefit in better understanding why Greece is the way it is.

Uhh, but it does, it just contains way less. Coumarine is one of the things that gives taste to cinnamon.

The only reason why it's called ""real"" cinnamon, is because it was the first type brought to Europe. 

The rest of your comment is filled with half-truths too. Cassia and Ceylon cinnamon are both types of the cinnamon-genus. They are related. On top of them, there are Saigon cinnamon from Vietnam, and a Indonesian type I can't remember the name of. 

Ceylon Cinnamon is called Cinnamomum verum, and has a more subtle taste, while Cassia Cinnamon(Cinnamomum Aromaticum) has a harsher and more distinctive taste. If you want subtle undertones of cinnamon flavour, that won't steal the scene and interrupt other tastes, verum is the one you are looking for.

true,welicious,null,null,"""Local"" is not always the right term, as I pointed out with examples from the current government.

And that's a slippery slope right there. The right to decide should apply to communities who have enough means to make the things about to decide happen. A neighborhood cannot decide about healthcare because they just cannot have enough resources to build their own hospitals, train doctors and so on. The same applies to cities, by the way.

By the way, that quote from Lincoln can be used either to justify the war on the South because economic and social issues, or to build the foundations on a technocratic dictatorship. ""Union"" is just a word, neither good or bad. Pretending that ""unity"" is good by default, and so democracy could be used as a tool to ignore other peoples wishes because every four years some people who, and let's be honest here, don't care enough about politics but if this or that guy looks better than the other one, is just wrong.

Why democracy may be the best form of government out there is because inclusion, not exclusion. Right now, a ten minutes decission made by a fifth of the spaniards is driving Spain to who knows where.

If that's democracy, well, I might prefer something else.

And so, if in ten years, languages like basque, catalan or galician, are banned from schools because some central nationalists idea of ""union"" is to forbid different cultures (slippery slope again, why not, uh?), do you really believe that a minority who wanted to vote and did it so wrong, have any right to decide the fates of anyone else?

Or just teach it their own way with a script from a historian or themselfs.

From example in 6th grade our class was asked if we wanted to look at the romans or rather move on to the middle ages. We did chose the romans because we thought they are cool. I however do not believe that I actually learned anything important back then. 

Another example would be that I skipped WW I almost completly due to the fact that I had two history teachers in high school. In the first year we looked at the french revolution and how napoleon helped us to become a democracy in 1848. After that we looked at the history of the middle east conflict between Israel and Palastine, because the second intifada had just come to an ""end"" and my teacher wanted to give us some history that had an actual and direct impact on the world today. We looked at all the wars between Isreal und their neighbours to get an idea of why the region is in it's current situation.

But then in the next year I switched class and history teacher. He tought everything in chronocal order and had already finished WW I. Therefore I started directly with the time between the wars and skipped WW I.

Di sicuro avranno problemi di scalabilità viste le dimensioni ma sinceramente non direi che paypal sia da tenere più di tanto in considerazione per le scelte tecnologiche. Azienda che tra l'altro avrà un centinaio di progetti interni, fatti con un set ampio di tecnologie diverse.
Poi esistono anche tantissime altre aziende che usano nodejs su alcuni progetti eh, sono purtroppo cosciente di questo fatto.

Io a un freelance che mi propone qualcosa fatto in nodejs giusto perchè può scrivermi un impiastro veloce fatto di librerie e poi scappare mostrerei la porta direttamente... poi dipende un po' da cosa si aspetta o da cosa interessa al cliente.
Personalmente preferisco tecnologie più stabili invece dell'ultima cagata appena uscita per non distribuire ai clienti dei mezzi cadaveri che a sorpresa potrebbero smettere di funzionare per motivi assurdi imputabili al framework usato (e a quel punto chi ti paga? la scelta del framework è stata tua, non del cliente).

Inoltre, è da notare che quelli che hanno scritto V8, che di problemi di scalabilità ne hanno parecchi, incredibilmente non usano nodejs e invece si sono scritti un linguaggio nuovo, Go, (un linguaggio vero, partito da una specifica, non come javascript :* ) e stanno spostando lo sviluppo lato server su quello.",0,1388157743,null,0,false,0,ceb615p,t3_1trk88,t1_ceb615p,t1_ceb4fpn,null,1427969254,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

We rather complain about it on reddit/twitter/facebook or by the coffee machine, then go back to our desk, look down so nobody notices us and keep thinking: ""hey, its not so bad after all, I´m not one of those 6million unemployed and I have enough for my pack of cigarrettes, my new jeans from H&amp;M and going to Torrevieja on holidays in Semana Santa"".

L'étude montre qu'au sortir de la guerre, en 1947, le sentiment religieux était significativement plus faible en France. Puis, alors que la situation économique s'améliore, il augmente. Ensuite, alors qu'on a deux crises et une aggravation de la situation économique (début du chômage, de l'endettement, chocs pétroliers), de 1975 à 1981, il baisse brutalement, et ensuite, le chômage empire, mais le sentiment religieux continue de baisser.

When pressed they admitted that over half of the ""hate crimes"" and ""attacks"" they were reporting took place completely on-line. In fact they consisted wholly of nasty posts on facebook, twitter and various blogs.
If that's a ""hate crime"" then half of /worldnews is about to be summoned before The Hague. And judging by some of the posts here the other half would be enthusiastically applauding.

The truth about the 'wave of attacks on Muslims’ after Woolwich murder

Yet the unending “cycle of violence” against Muslims, the unprecedented “wave of attacks” against them from strangers in the street, the “underlying Islamophobia in our society” – all turn out to be yet more things we thought we knew about Woolwich that are not really supported by the evidence.

Tell Mama confirmed to The Sunday Telegraph that about 120 of its 212 “anti-Muslim incidents” – 57 per cent – took place only online. They were offensive postings on Twitter or Facebook, or comments on blogs: nasty and undesirable, certainly, but some way from violence or physical harm and often, indeed, legal. Not all the offending tweets and postings, it turns out, even originated in Britain.

Tell Mama has no written definition of what it classes as an anti-Muslim incident, but has in the past adopted a wide definition. Last November, the cross-bench Asian peer, Baroness Flather, told a newspaper it was “pointless for the Conservatives to chase Muslim votes.

They are all on benefits and all vote Labour”. Tell Mama added this admittedly crass and untrue remark to its database as an “anti-Muslim incident,” though it said it had deleted it following an explanation from Lady Flather.

Although the service says its caseworkers “carefully handle each report as it comes in, to determine whether it can be verified and justified as an anti-Muslim incident”, Mr Mughal admitted that a further 35 of the 212 post-Woolwich incidents, or 16 per cent, had yet to be verified. He justified publishing the figure, however, saying he expected that all but a handful of incidents would be verified.

Fewer than one in 12 of the 212 “incidents” reported to Tell Mama since Woolwich – 17 cases (8 per cent) – involved individuals being physically targeted.""",0,1388162585,null,0,false,0,ceb7m1k,t3_1tt8n8,t1_ceb7m1k,t3_1tt8n8,null,1427968516,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,angry_spaniard,ESPR,Delenda est euro,"The combined cycle power plants, one of the largest industrial investments in recent history, are operating only to 10%  capacity after the fall in electricity demand.


At the country of the airports without airplanes, silent and empty toll roads and half-finished 
developments, the excesses age's fables abound, and their morals. Here is another
is narrated, but this isn't simple one more, because what is stuck is one of the largest 
industrial investments in recent history. Energy giants invested over 15 billion euros 
that were spent to raise tens of combined cycle power plants to generate electricity 
from natural gas. Now they just run 10% of its capacity, the Government discussed with 
the companies the temporary closure of some and there is  several people who talk about 
dismantling them.


The official aspiration, a decade ago, was moving to a sustainable future hands in hand of 
more efficient plants, which use a cleaner fuel than coal or fossil fuel. And that adapted
better to renewable sources for its ability to adjust its contribution to the electricity network:
Something essential when the intermittent sun and wind gain prominence. But the plans 
failed the test of lack of demand.


In 2008, with the combined-cycle and at full speed, 32% of the electricity consumed 
in Spain was produced with gas, double than with coal (16%). So far, as expected. But when 
the increasing usage of renewable energy combined with the crisis and other factors,
the script failed: Coal production holds^1, while generation from gas collapses. This year,
 the combined cycle plants have generated only 9% of the electricity, compared with 14% 
produced in coal plants that emit more than twice the greenhouse gases.


Pedro Linares, co-director of the Research Center for Energy Economics, explains why,
 in the early years of this century, combined cycle plants were the main answer for 
companies to the then growing power demand. ""There were cheap and easy to finance,
construction was less expensive and faster than other conventional power plants and were 
less pollutants. Perceived little risk, there was over-investment, ""says the
coordinator of the BP chair at the  Pontificia Comillas University of Madrid.

""We must go back to the conditions under which these decisions were made,""
insist Mariano Marzo, Professor of Energy at the University of Barcelona. As in the 
nesting dolls, the gas would be a bubble inside another (consumer) within the huge credit
bubble of the past decade. ""Energy planning is done years away, and then the demand in 
Spain was rising like a rocket,"" emphasizes March. The public sector support also 
contributed, with millionaire investment incentives charged in the electricity bill, 
that can recover more than a third of spending several years.

Only Germany stands comparison in continental Europe, though even there the deployment 
wasn't so intense. Since the first combined cycle plant opened in 2002 until 
the 27,000 megawatts of installed power were reached, it's the  technology able to 
generate more energy in Spain-, only seven years passed. And pending applications reached 
double that figure.


[...]

The auction system in effect multiplies the effects of lack of demand. 
Because not only gives priority to renewables, 
but placed ahead hydraulic and nuclear power stations (most owned by the big three),
which is paid in addition to the price of the last conventional thermal to enter 
(coal or gas naturally) in the system. ""Nuclear and hydroelectric plants, which have 
recouped most of the investment are those that benefit most,"" said Fabra.

[...]

The future of combined cycle plants, however, depends on what the government 
has been two years avoiding to face . ""they have to define a new regulatory framework 
for the remuneration of the entire energy system,"" explains Professor March, and Spain is
also missing a new energy plan to 2030, to incorporate the new economic conditions and 
clarify which energy mix will be better. A process that the government, pushed by 
controversial power auction for the next quarter, seems now willing to address.
But in a desperate situation , without  known planning, and with the dubious distinction of having turned against
consumer associations, large utilities and renewable energy producers.

For instance, I've been living with swedish and norwegian people, needless to say you can imagine how awkward they felt at first living with a couple of mediterraneans, our way of interacting, talking, is really invasive to vikings, to us they just seem a bit weird, kinda like scared of human contact; but the thing that totally blew my mind away once was the swedish girl doing this:

&gt;-me chillin in my room (which is next to the main door to the flat)

&gt;-swedish girl walks up to this door, she's off to work

&gt;-me: ey! how are you? off to work?

&gt;-she: yes, I'm in a hurry, bye!

&gt;-she proceeds to open the door

&gt;-as she does this, she sees the door across the hall opening as well, it's our neighbor

&gt;-she quickly shuts the door again and stands there, kinda listening to the noise in the hall

&gt;-me: look at her from my room, ask her what she's doing

&gt;-she looks at me, says nothing, looks through the peephole of the door

&gt;-keeps standing there for a couple of minutes in silence, until the neighbor is gone

&gt;-proceeds to tell me again she's in a hurry and can't talk, leaves

&gt;-me: what.the.fuck?


you see? This is fuckin funny to us, if you run into your damned neighbor you say hello, you ask him how are things and talk about the weather or the family as you walk down the stairs together, it's basic social skills to us, and if you're southern and don't do it, we think you're weird.

It's a very long-term outlook that relies on faulty assumptions - it assumes that the value of the euro is set to plummet, which doesn't seem to be happening yet, and also assumes that Germany's population will fall without any action to prevent this (gastarbeiter, anyone?). 

The following section of the article seems especially odd:

&gt;In a significant boost to George Osborne’s austerity programme, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) hailed the UK as the second-best performing economy in the Western world after the United States – and said France was one of the worst.

It seems to suggest that the UK is already one of the best performing western economies, which isn't true at all. We haven't even outperformed Germany yet: Eurostat predicts a 0.5% GDP rise for the UK and a 0.7% rise for Germany, both pretty terrible but the UK is still behind.

Comme toute loi restreignant une liberté fondamentale, il faut que la restriction soit très clairement définie et ne puisse être exploitée par des gouvernants malveillants.

* Pas de censure a priori : s'il y a violation de la loi, la justice tranchera (interdire préventivement un spectacle de Dieudonné est aberrant : si ça devait être le cas il faudrait que ça soit une décision de justice).

* Pas de loi mémorielle. Si un discours tombe sous le coup de la loi qui empêche le hate speech, c'est réglé. Si ça n'est pas le cas c'est le boulot des historiens. Les politiques ne devraient pas figer l'histoire.

true,TikiTDO,CANA,Canada,"&gt; In this case money is being poured into economies with severe problems, with few constraints and no oversight. How do we know that it will not go straight out again? This is a high risk strategy.

Isn't it being injected into the economy under the oversight of the Russian central banks? It's under the constraints and oversights of those banks. How is this in any way different than when the US or the UK perform the exact same operation?

&gt; He isn't. He has surrounded himself with so many ""yes-men"" that however smart he started off as, without the challenges inherent in an active cabinet, he is making mistakes.

You can, of course, provide sources to support these claims? Mean beyond ""some guy on a blog once said so."" Putin was a KGB spy; this was an organization that took the best and the brightest of soviet Russia's students for several generations, and he was near the top of the power structure. Now you're telling me that he decided to just get a bunch of ""yes-men"" to follow him around? He's managed to practically take over one of the largest countries in the world. That's not something you can do with a bunch of useless hangers on.

Also, what mistakes is he making? Most of the people saying he is making mistakes are western interests, and from their perspective he is making mistakes because he is working against their interests and priorities. 

&gt; Does he? He has seriously impeded the development of companies on a normal commercial basis since he came to power

This implies that the most effective way to develop Oil/Gas is on a normal commercial basis. Your biases are showing.

&gt; This has happened by too much power being vested into state bodies without adequate controls, hence the abuses where security and tax officials are involved in the confiscation of businesses for their personal benefit.

Russia has it's own culture and problems. You are viewing this through a lens of your own culture, and in some respects yes, it looks pretty bad. However, the issue is that the alternative solutions that exist in your country have often been tried, and were found to be even worse within that culture. 

There is no switch anyone could flip to make Russia suddenly work exactly like the US. In the end the people with power grew up in completely different environments. 

&gt; That is what we have been saying since the mid-nineties but it still hasn't happened. It sort of started after the devaluation of 98, but the reintroduction of the state as an active participant killed all that.

But Polish workers live adjacent to the rest of Europe, traveling and working there in great numbers, and thus aspire to a higher standard of living.

Well according to [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385612/) their sample of *Cinnamomum verum* from Sri Lanka was coumarin-free as opposed to samples of cassia, and generally it contains at most only tiny insignificant traces of coumarin: only about 0.004% whereas cassia contains up to 1%.

I really wouldn't hang my hat on that 0.004% as it's insignificant any way you look at it, but as it seems important to you: yes it is there. Now what?

&gt; The only reason why it's called ""real"" cinnamon, is because it was the first type brought to Europe.

So? It *is* called real cinnamon and true cinnamon isn't it. And cheaper cassia is also called bastard cinnamon or Chinese cinnamon isn't it.

&gt; The rest of your comment is filled with half-truths too. 

Yet you haven't shown any half-truths yet, it is true that *Cinnamomum verum* is called real cinnamon or true cinnamon, and the tiny traces of coumarin it contains are at most insignificant compared to the 250-fold levels found in cassia.

&gt; Cassia and Ceylon cinnamon are both types of the cinnamon-genus. They are related. On top of them, there are Saigon cinnamon from Vietnam, and a Indonesian type I can't remember the name of. 

Yes?

&gt; Ceylon Cinnamon is called Cinnamomum verum, and has a more subtle taste, while Cassia Cinnamon(Cinnamomum Aromaticum) has a harsher and more distinctive taste. If you want subtle undertones of cinnamon flavour, that won't steal the scene and interrupt other tastes, verum is the one you are looking for.

To my taste cassia (*Cinnamomum cassia* Blume, syn. *Cinnamomum aromaticum* Nees) has some wooden 'mossy' tones and certain bitterness in it. Personally I very much prefer real cinnamon in baking, desserts, sweets and such for its more aromatic taste and also for the fact that I can let the kids eat as many as they like without having to give a second thought to coumarin and their livers.

I also very much like Saigon cinnamon (*Cinnamomum loureiroi*). With its strong pronounced taste it's especially good for cooking asian dishes. EDIT: And yes, even if it's called Saigon cinnamon also *C. loureiloi* is actually cassia.",0,1388175271,null,0,1388178438,0,cebcnlk,t3_1tst0c,t1_cebcnlk,t1_ceb5754,null,1427966152,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Gleich vorneweg, groß war die Beteiligung leider nicht, die Kabel Deutschland drossel news waren wohl spannender. 

Der erste Artikel ([hier](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/1tltln/verfassungsgericht_biologische_v%C3%A4ter_haben_das/)) berichtet über die Entscheidung des Verfassungsgerichts die sozialen Väter gegenüber den biologischen zu bevorzugen. D.h. solltest du, ich nehme mal kackfrech an du bist männlich, je eine Affaire mit einer verheirateten  Frau beginnen und dabei mit ihr ein Kind zeugen, und sollte sie danach zu ihrem Ehemann zurückkehren, wirst du selbst wenn du es wolltest nicht als Vater anerkannt. Es gibt wahrscheinlich andere Situationen in denen dieses Urteil auch greifen wird.       
Der link hatte 16 up- /5 downvotes, 10 Kommentare wobei der oberste laut proklamiert wie richtig diese Entscheidung doch sei, ach ja irgend was von Besitzdenken war da auch noch. Genauer ausgeführt wurde diese Meinung allerdings nicht. Der Rest war qualitativ auch nicht sehr berauschend.       

Der zweite ([hier](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/1tltgj/niveas_weihnachtswerbekampagne_wo_ist_papa/)) war ein Blogeintrag über die Nivea Weihnachtswerbung, mitspielen tut hier 1 Mutter, 1 Onkel, 1 Sohn (kleinkind) und 1 paar Großeltern aber kein Vater. Das finden so einige Männerrechtler gar nicht witzig.      
Der link hatt 6 downvotes eingeheimst und keine Kommentare, eas keine große Überraschung für mich war. Muss auch sagen bin auch nicht der Meinung das man den Spot jetzt unbedingt verteufeln muss.


Der dritte ([hier](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/1tltay/erk%C3%A4ltung_m%C3%A4nner_leiden_st%C3%A4rker/) allerdings war eine Überraschung für mich. Es geht um eine Studie die herausgefunden haben will das Männer an Erkältungen wirklich mehr leiden als Frauen und nicht nur so tun. Ich hatte mir gedacht das ist doch ein lockeres Thema, da kann man gut Witze zu machen, das kommt bestimmt relativ gut an. Pustekuchen, es gab 2 up-/4 downvotes und keinerlei Kommentare.


Der vierte ist dieser Artkel hier, wie du selber sehen kanst nicht viel los. Was richtig Schade ist, der währe es Wert diskutiert zu werden. 15 up und 14 down.       


Nummer 5 ([hier](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/1tloll/sexuelle_bel%C3%A4stigung_im_job_auch_m%C3%A4nner_sind_opfer/)) hatte am meisten Aufmerksamkeit bekommen. Das Thema ist ""Sexuelle Belästigung von Männern"", er hatt bisher 40 up-\15 downvotes was ja eigentlich ganz gut für /r/de ist. Die 18 Kommentare allerdings sind auf Schulniveau und unbrauchbar.


Der sechste ([hier](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/1tloke/spd_essen_missachtet_eigene_quotenregelung_f%C3%BCr/)) befasst sich mit der SPD Essen und deren Unvermögen ihre eigene Quotenregelung für Frauen umzusetzen. Spoiler: Nicht genug Frauen die sich engagieren und natürlich die bösen Platzhirsche (sic) die ihren Listenplatz nicht räumen wollen. Der Artikel hatt 9 up-\6 downvotes und zwei Kommentare.

Und der letzte ([hier](http://ooe.orf.at/news/stories/2621536/)) bricht mir eigentlich fast schon das Herz. Ein 52-jähriger hatte sich vor einen Frauenhaus selbst angezündet und ist nicht lange danach verstorben. Die Nachrichtenseite selbst hatte auch anscheinend kein Interesse daran herauszufinden wieso er so weit ging. Und /r/de auch nicht 4 up\4 down und 0 Kommentare ...

There are some problems with more costly electricity, export to Ukraine/Belarus/Russia which is very profitable (even if also very unreliable) source of income, and which was much more important for Poland in nineties, and much easier before we've choosen EU and the tarrifs went up on both sides.

Many Polish companies were closed because of EU laws (for example sugar production quotas forced most of Polish sugar factories to default, and now Poland imports most of the sugar from Germany and farmers had to choose something different to grow, now it's similar with tobbaco). EU also forced Poles to build the stuff that was financed by it using very strict ecological standards, more strict than most of western motorways use, that caused Polish motorways to be much more costly than was nessesary (on the other hand animals have it easier to cross the roads).

Also the mass emigration to UK wasn't a one-sided thing. It was good for Job Office and because of remmitances, but it also made Polish population and internal market smaller, inflation bigger, and the demographic prospects aren't exactly bright.

Wie das jetzt in die Synchronisation kommt?

Spencer &amp; Hill-Filme sind durch die locker, flockigen Sprüche in der deutschen Synchronisation bekannt geworden. Der Ruf Solingens scheint damals noch bekannter gewesen zu sein. Also warum sich einen Ast dabei abbrechen, die Witze zu übersetzen, wenn man doch auch einen Witz mit Deutschlandbezug machen kann. 
Die Synchronstudios und Regisseure hatten damals anscheinend mehr Freiheiten in der Übersetzung. Würde auch die selbe Anspielung im 3 Jahre später erscheinenden Python-Film erklären. Ähnliches Phänomen ist außerdem bei ""Die Zwei"" zu beobachten. Wie bei Bud Spencer und Terence Hill zeigte sich hier Rainer Brandt für die Synchronisationsdrehbücher verantwortlich.

Heute, besonders bei amerikanischen Sitcoms zu beobachten, wird eher versucht sich am Original langzuhangeln und selbst ein unübersetzbarer Witz ins Deutsche transportiert (Siehe alle CBS-Serien).
Auch hier gibt es natürlich noch Ausnahmen, die haben subjektiv aber eher abgenommen.

EDIT: Happy Cake Day! :-)

I agree with everything you said, except this. We didn't bully you into doing this. We did'nt force you into doing this. We influenced you, yes, and we have huge influence on the continent, but remember, **your countries did this willingly and of their own regard.** 

The U.S. government didn't force your country's hand. Your country willingly gave it. And it did it because it was in their benefit. Because it was in their interests. 

This isn't your countries abandoning their interests to suit U.S. interests. It's your countries aligning with U.S. interests because it furthers their own interests. 

Deflecting the blame by saying your country was *""bullied""* and had no defense because it's only a puny *""satellite state""* of the Great American Hegemony is **exactly** what your politicians want you to do. It's keep the heat off them and gives the public a boogeyman to go after instead of them *(Not to deflect any blame from my own country, because please, we have PLENTLY to own up to lol)*.

For the price of the course, it's probably worth trying to register outside of the application time.

Where I am, I signed up at the end of August and began classes the middle of September. The course continues on until May, when we have a final exam. The sign up process was fairly simple. I went to the school and filled out a form to reserve my spot; filled out another form on their website, then took it to the bank to pay my registration fees and have the form stamped; then took the stamped form back to the school. They give you a three day window to complete the sign-up process before you lose your reserved spot.

My classes are Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9-11am. Your school most likely would have similar slots. It works out well for me, as my kids are in school during the day.

1. Germany becomes pretty offensive and want to annex the free city of danzig. But the offer from Germany is actually kinda deeper, they want Poland to join anti-comintern pact (which basically meant they want to become some sort of our allies) We refuse. 

2. France and Great Britain welcome Poland in their alliance. Both promise millitary answer to eventual German aggression. 

3. Germany - which became obviously offensive after our refusal - declares us a war. France and UK, although they also declare war to Germany, decide to not do shit.

4. We of course lose - with big help from our Russian friends. Our soldiers run away in pretty decent numbers and then start to fight for independence of our allies. We may not be the biggest force but it's not like Polish soldiers didn't do anything after 1939.

Je pense que les condamnations pour propos racistes, homophobes etc devraient être abolies. Comme le dit Cayou, la société devrait ridiculiser mais la loi ne devrait pas punir.

Après, là où je ne suis pas d'accord avec certaines personnes c'est que je pense que l'Etat doit se munir de moyens de surveiller (pas modérer) internet. Le harcèlement, l'arnaque sont des problèmes extrêmement présents sur internet et à l'heure qu'il est personne n'est vraiment tenu pour responsable puisque la preuve doit être amenée par la victime. Toutefois, ces surveillances doivent être limitées et doivent rester sous le contrôle strict de la justice, exactement de la même manière avec laquelle les autorités pourraient fouiller votre domicile. C'est là que je rejoins ceux qui dénoncent la loi sur la programmation militaire.

You Anglo-Saxons keep saying this... I don't know if that ever was true, but by now that is no more than an urban myth, perpetuated by Fawlty Tower sketches.  
Visit Germany and you will be reminded of WWII everywhere. From the architecture of our cities over weekly magazine articles (I think no other person has been more often on ""Der Spiegel""s title page than Hitler) over almost daily TV discussions and documentaries.  
Also, by now WWII is quite a bit away. My father is in his seventies now, but he was a little boy when the war ended.  
Of course, you don't exactly whip out WWII as a conversation piece with strangers in the street, same way you wouldn't in Canada or in the US. But when you are here privately and introduce yourself as a history student, then discussing WWII is very nearly inevitable.  
Like my late grandfather, some actual war veterans, such as there still are, still refuse to talk about their personal experiences. My grandfather was one of them. To this day we don't know if he witnessed, was subjected to, or perpetrated something horrible, because he would only ever talk about the time he was a POW with the British forces. He was a Wehrmacht grunt on the western front is all we know.

   In a lot of ways you are right.

This is why a lot of Euroskeptics prefer the Council, because it reinforces that nature, as opposed to the federalist one.  

&gt;The European Council President is a new position. Its political strength is yet to be defined. We can't make a conclusion about it based solely on HVR.

Well, the position has not enshrined right or powers inside the combined EU institutions, his only presence outside the Council is as its representative in the EU, and as one of the EUs representative outside of it, this might push the balance to more charismatic individual.

The position also has no machinery under him, similar to the staffs of other national leaders (The position of president of the USA, for example, is better thought of as the entire white house than just the individual person). In fact he acts as member of staff to the council inside itself and in the EU.

Lastly, he sits in meetings with national leaders, representatives of member states, from which he also draws both his presence in that position as well as its legitimacy. This makes him the weakest member in that room by far.

Avant le fameux scetch polémique que dieudonné avait fait chez fogiel je ne le connaissais pas vraiment. Ce n'est que 2 ans plus tard que j'ai regardé un de ses spectacles (mes excuses). Je n'ai jamais autant rie devant un spectacle,  je suis bon publique pourtant mais pas sans intelligence dans l'humour. Étant toujours intéressé par l'histoire j'ai plutôt une bonne culture.  J'ai donc ensuite matté le fameux scetch. Et là, surprise: rien. Juste un truc écrit à la ca-vite ciblé de maniere à faire rire l'inviter (jamel) mais aucun choc, rien ne me vient et je comprends pourtant tout ce dont il parle. Les retombées de ce sketch sont disproportionnées, lui viré et toutes les chaines l'accablent ( me rapel de cette époque) et PERSONNE qui n'ose dire simplement ""oui bon c'était un sketch et il a rien dit de terrible""
En autre exemple me vient: sarko et sa phrase sur les racailles. J'ai toujours regardé le zapping de canal. Le jour où ça s' est produit je vu 6 fois la scène en 2 jours. 
 La 1ere sur fr2 au tf1 ,on le voyait dire la phrase. Puis au zapping  mais là il se passe un truc avant: une vieille enragée et désespérée crie a sa fenêtre: oui on en a marre de ces racaille et la sarko, dans sa demago de politicard (qu'ils ont tous) répète en fait c'te phrase. Ce procédé a un nom en psychologie mais je ne l'ai plus. Bref en gros c'etait rien de plus que de la demago.  Bref la redif suivante du zapping avait enlevé ce prémice et on ne voyait plus que sarko sortir ""sa"" fameuse phrase. Je vous jure que c'est vrai! Et toutes les chaînes ne montraient donc que ce passage et lynchage de tous sur lui (j'aime pas vraiment sarko mais encore moins l'injustice et encore moins être pris pour un con)
J'ai vu et vois beaucoup de messages tronqués par les médias.  Un simple fait tout simple: leur diction (c'est dur à mettre en mots a 4h) .N'avez vous par remarqué ce moule dans lequel est mis l'information avant d'être livrée?  On l'entend. 
Un peu plus loin il y a la tournure des phrases qui d'une chaîne à l'autre, selon leur opinion sur le sujet ou ce qu'ils veulent qu'on comprenne est totalement différente.  Essayez, regardez regulierement un journal puis l'autre . 
Et puis putain pourquoi est ce que quand un mec va avec une arme a l'anpe en desepoir de cause puis la semaine suivante un autre a sa banque (pour un decouvert de 37e infondé qu'il ne peut cependant pas payer tellement dans la merde) les medias les appels forcenés?!? Par ce simple mot leur liberté d'expression à ce moment là leur est volée: le message au lieu d'être celui du mec est celui d'un fou...
Bref tout ceci pour montrer que notre expression n'est déjà pas si libre que ça, une grande partie de nos messages sont biaisés. Je crois peu en cette grande dame.

If you hold than an individual potential benefit to society should be valued in the present, then one could say that every embryo has value. This puts both the benefit, the onus and thus the center of the discussion on the greater community.

 The problem has been that the anti-abortion argument has been done while promoting the family as the building block of society. Thus putting the onus but not the benefit or choice into the hands of the family, but because we live in modern western society mostly individual parents. So society would benefit from the child at the cost of the parents, which as we have seen is incredibly problematic as the child potential depends on the ability of his parents to take care of him.

I promote legalized abortion because I realize we have an individualistic society more than a communal one, and it is easier to make peoples live better and easier by giving them this choice than try to change the entire social system.

edit: Please don't use the scientific argument on what is obviously a value choice problem. I know the opposite camp has painted it as a religious issue, but they don't need to control the narrative. 

Not only that but whenever someone make an issue a religious one, they are knowingly or unknowingly diffusing the scientific argument, since religion has always been the belief in that which lies between the provable.

I mentioned my interest in the Wars to my Professorin and she looked rather stingy as soon as I brought it up. I'm entirely sure this doesn't apply to most Germans, I was merely going off of my own experiences. 

Hahaha, oh man I love Fawlty Towers. My favourite episode is probably the Rat episode.


I do agree to its distance. I'm quite distraught with the fact that some Americans are still angry at Japan - I'm sad to report I've met people like this. America is a weird nation, completely.


My grandfather only told my dad what he knew because my dad had asked. One of the only things my grandfather kept was the beltbuckle of a Luftwaffe soldier he killed in a really tight situation. The two of them were practically hugging because my grandfather had fallen on the German, and then my grandfather was sliced in his arm by the German's bayonet - they were that close that German couldn't shoot because his rifle was too large in the small area they were in. My grandfather quickly grabbed his pistol and shot the German, and the bullet flew off of the German's belt buckle (and dented it), swiftly killing him. My dad only saw the belt buckle once. I never met my grandfather and I **really** wish I had that. His medals are nice to have though. I'm not sure about his 3 brothers but they served too.


On the other hand is my great grandfather, who didn't tell my (mom's dad) grampa anything. Luckily we know lots about his exploits, and if you see my post on r/watches, I just was given his 99 year old watch by my grandfather. We have lots of medals, badgpes/pins, and even an epaulette from his uniform, as well as spurs (he was cavalry) and his helmet. It's really fascinating to hold all of it and think, ""my ancestor wore this in battle."" I'm sure you've probably got a good collection of items in your family as well. I know Germany had conscription for both wars (as did the UK and her children), so there are many with grampas and great grampas who served. 


Sorry to go on a tangent, but for the sake of conversation I'll continue this for a bit:


In November when we have Remembrance Day, here we focus on WW1 mainly, it seems. This is most likely because we lost 65,000 men in that war, and only 50-something thousand in WW2. Our men poured themselves dry to help our Crown. We obviously also look to the recent conflicts, but WW1 was a period where Canada became known amongst powers as a nation which could contribute strong and well. I was told ""sturmtruppen"" was first used as an expression for Canadians (obviously through Germans). Whether this is true or not, it is very cool to know we gained the respect of your soldiers. This is why I'm interested in WW1 so much. It was practically a medieval conflict - Monarchs of Europe, fighting over who is most powerful, while soldiers sometimes practice chivalry between one another. Even Hitler respected Canada so much, he had a few SS soldiers guard the Vimy Ridge Canada Memorial (in Vimy of course) because apparently our men were valiant opponents who deserved not to have their monument (a rather nice one too) be destroyed. It's an interesting little fact like this which makes Hitler and WW2 so interesting!


Anyways, yeah, it is totally a generational thing. I've met many many vets who didn't want to talk about their time. Hell, my grandfather burned his uniform because of all the terrible memories (such as the close-quarters kill), and the fact that he lost too many friends.




Man oh man, I would love to say hello when I come to Germany. Sadly, the earliest that would be is (maybe and hopefully) *2 years* from now. I hope to come for exchange in Third Year. Money is a slight struggle at the moment, because the recession chopped my father's paycheck significantly. I really appreciate the offer though, thanks!

I think saying that Italy is one of the most ethnically preserved European countries may be a bit of an exaggeration, though, since much of northern and western Europe was never ruled or inhabited by non-Europeans. The British Isles, France, the Low Countries, Germany, Scandinavia, Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia (and Finland and Estonia, if you count them as ""European"") have never been ruled or inhabited by any significant number of non-Europeans. Iberia (during the period of Al-Andalus) and the Balkan peninsula (which experienced large-scale Turkish immigration in the 17th-19th centuries) are really the only parts of Europe that have been ruled or inhabited by any significant number of non-Europeans.

It's worth pointing out that most Italian immigrants to America came from southern Italy and Sicily, not northern Italy. Southern Italy was poorer and people there had fewer economic prospects, so they emigrated. Northern Italians, who look less ""Mediterranean"" and more ""northern European,"" mostly stayed in Italy.
