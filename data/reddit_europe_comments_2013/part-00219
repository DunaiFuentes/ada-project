true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"&gt;I'd advise you to read more about Polish history if you want to argue that point. Historically Kresy were a part of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which in the eve of the 19th century was forcibly divided by 3 countries, among them Russia. 

Was ""The Commonwealth"" just anothern name for Poland or was the Commonwealth a union between two sovereign states, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania? If the latter is true, then Lithuania had better claims on Kresy than Poland. If you want to claim that Kresy rightfully belonged to Poland on ethnic grounds then keep in mind that Polish people were a minority there. 

&gt;Besides the war that you speak of was caused by Russia itself, Poland was defending their own territory.

Bullshit. Krevy was gained following the Polish-Ukrainian War. The region was not part of Poland after it regained its independence. 


&gt;But to claim that Russian forces were liberating Poland is a blatant lie. As per Ribbentron-Molotov Act of 1939 Polish lands were divided between Nazi Germany and USSR. Russian forces commited many atrocities on the claimed lands, the most famous being The Katyn Forest Massacre

Who was responsible for Poland's liberation from Nazy Germany?

&gt;Only after Hitler decided to attack Russia, did Russian forces intervene in Poland. But not only did they not come to liberate, they came to conquer what the thought should be theirs. After the war USSR formed a puppet government in Poland and created a country by the name of People's Republic of Poland. This country had no legitimacy form Polish people and was in fact a totalitarian country. From 1952 to 1989 Poland was not a free country and was occupied by Russian forces. Many of Polish citizens were victims of the Russian regime, and only after 1989 can you really speak about free Polish country.

The USSR had no intention of annexing Poland. What it wanted to achieve was a buffer zone between it and the West.

The other one is made with honey instead of sugar. Heat 150gr honey and 500ml water up, scratch out a vanilla pod and add both vanilla pulp and pod. Let it cook for 4-5 minutes, then take it off the stove and let it cool down. Squeeze 6-7 lemons until you have ~350ml juice and pour it in a can. Add the honey syrup and stir.

Quant à ""aucun respect pour les lois de la République"", ""peu de désir de s'intégrer"", et ""profiter du système"", je ferai ces remarques :

* sur le ""peu de désir de s'intégrer"" : la jeune fille était scolarisée, en France depuis près de cinq ans, francophone... A l'évidence sa vie future était ici. Expulsée elle ne pourra plus guère s'intégrer, même si elle le souhaitait. Un peu comme les roms, qu'on trimballe d'une commune à l'autre, pour ensuite leur reprocher d'être ""inassimilables"".

* sur le respect des lois de la République : certes le père a menti. C'est mal, mais c'est un peu court pour parler d'""aucun respect"". On connait des Français qui ne respectent pas les lois de la République, et à un tout autre niveau de mensonge, de fraude et de préjudice pour le pays. Les pouvoirs publics semblent moins pressés de sévir. Plus facile d'être fermes avec les petites gens.

* sur le troisième point : bien sûr que les immigrés viennent pour ""profiter"" - de conditions de vie (ou de survie) potentiellement meilleures que chez eux. Pourquoi des millions de gens sont-ils partis aux Etats-Unis? Cela a-t-il empêché le pays de devenir la première économie du monde, ou n'est-ce pas plutôt grâce à cela? ""Profiter"" ne signifie pas non plus ne rien apporter en échange. Et encore une fois, on en connait qui ""profitent"" à un tout autre niveau, en toute impunité ou presque.

It's irrelevant what percent of the ever expanding debt you would repay. If you were a sovereign state and I had good reason to believe you would repay the original sum of capital lended to you (which is a given) plus any additional sum in compound interest, I would certainly lend you money. Coincidentally that's what everyone does on the international level. So your ""argument"" if it can be called that, is based on a sort of an equivocacy fallacy. When you are saying ""I won't repay all the money back"" you mean that the official debt after adding the interest will never be paid back. The fact you don't seem to understand how that's impossible due to the nature of international lending is not particularly flattering for you but let's disregard that. However that doesn't mean you don't have a profit. The original sum of capital lended is repaid exactly due to the interest rate being too high, which it is exactly because of the risk of lending to a sovereign state. 

In sort, ""all the money"" in these cases is already paid back and then some way before we even start discussing default. Default becomes an issue when the debt becomes unsustainable because its inflation due to the interest rate overcomes the growth of the economy.

Examples. You lend a sovereign state 10.000Eur with a 10% interest rate to be repaid in 10 years. The formula used to calculate the final debt is M = P( 1 + i )n Where M is the final amount, P the principal amount, i is the interest rate per year and n the number of years. That's M = 10.000( 1 + 0.10)^10 Which is M ~ 25.000Eur (this obviously gets bigger the more the installments). That means that even if my debtor defaulted in the 4th installment I would have had a profit. The original sum of money and then some would have been repaid.

I think the Nazi Reich would certainly not have fallen if Hitler didn't pull the Soviets in the war. And be that as it may, it is still the blood of these normal, everyday Soviet citizens that was spilled for your ancestor's lives. And that should be respected. And with respected I do not mean you shouldn't be critical of the many mistakes made. Or to close your eyes to the fact that the political reality of the time lead to a less than ideal aftermath.

But replacing this memory with only disdain and contempt, that I think is wrong and it does injustice to the history of Poland

&gt;Go extrapolate for yourself.

Extrapolation is not always the best method. And beside that, most of the archival evidence we possess of these rapes, at least in Germany, are the Soviet archives. Meaning arrests and punishments of soldiers who committed rape. The Soviet Union actively tried to stop this.

But I'm not going to try minimize what happened, I'm not interested in apologizing the Soviet Union. It did happen and not enough was done about it.

&gt;The conquest of Poland of 1945 has nothing to do with freedom. There was no freedom in Poland until the Soviet forces were driven out of here in 1993. It's ridiculous to even suggest that.

Didn't your parents grew up, worked and have children free of torture and want? Or were their lives here on earth untill 1993 rendered completely useless because of the realization they formed part of the USSR hegemony?

The opinions you have are not just a result of an honest yearning of the citizens of the People's Republic of Poland to more political freedom and the consumer goods Poles couldn't obtain back then. It is also a product that is being constantly renewed and reinvigorated in Poland today. Let's assume someone, maybe you, who has not experienced much of Poland's pre-1993 history as an adult. He is not a product of the PRL, but of Poland today. And still, his generation hates the Soviets with more vigour than his parents ever did. 

People are being fed hate and anger all over Eastern Europe. Maybe as much as the hate spread towards capitalist countries during the Socialist period. The reasons remain the same, the ruling ideology needs it to survive.

Muss nicht unbedingt stimmen. Beispiel Schweiz:

&gt; Obwohl Waffenmissbrauch auch in der Schweiz ein Problem ist, ist das Waffenrecht der Eidgenossen immer noch eines der liberalsten der Welt. Abgesehen davon, dass Armeeangehörige ihre Dienstwaffe üblicherweise zu Hause aufbewahren, sind Kauf und Besitz von Waffen und Munition jedem Bürger gestattet. Seit 2008 müssen Waffenbesitzer allerdings amtliche Bewilligungen haben, vorher genügte der Nachweis eines Kaufvertrags. 2010 wurde ein elektronisches Register zur Erfassung aller Waffenkäufe eingeführt. Weitere Bemühungen um die Verschärfung der Waffenrechts sind bislang gescheitert. In der Schweiz gibt es bei rund acht Millionen Einwohnern etwa 2,5 Millionen legale Waffen, 1,2 Millionen davon kommen vom Militär.

As a culture it's just objectively bad. There's nothing wrong with them as human beings, just the culture the've adopted. From the sounds of it, Roma in Finland don't have the culture because they've stuck around in one place long enough to get a job. If they actually did have the culture then they'd mostly just steal instead of actually working for wages.

Only if the threat that the intelligence agencies give to companies is worse than the billions in fines the EU will give it when it finds out. They could use force but that's so illegal that it would be political suicide for any politician to suggest that using force to steal data was OK. It makes the process very risky for companies. Most of the data given to the NSA was given voluntarily. The EU is making a strong enough threat than that data will no longer be given voluntarily and it will become an industry standard to reject such requests for risk of fines. Now depending on how corrupt the judiciary is they will refuse any request which doesn't comply with these regulations. In the UK the judiciary has historically been much better than politicians at protecting civil liberties than politicians. 

The problem has always been that they've had little ground to stand on. As John Oliver said over the summer when he was hosting the Daily Show 'Were not upset you broke the law, Mr President, were upset you didn't have to'. Well these regulations effectively mean that if GCHQ or the NSA want information like they had before they will probably have to break the law which will give judges more leeway to rule against the government and will make politicians less likely to side with them because no politicians is going to side with someone who broke the laws they wrote, it would, in the UK at least, be very hard to live down and knowing the press in this country would mean the end of your political career.

Don't count on it.

Furthermore, the UK is not part of Schengen and *is an island* so the Roma will need to actually state there reasons for coming to the UK at which point they'll probably be turned away. 

Just to put that into perspective a little, the UK has a net immigration of about 200,000 every year ([Source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11094468)). So unless about a quarter of Bulgaria *and* Romania's Roma population upsticks and moved to the UK *all the in the same year*, then you're probably not going to feel much difference.

Even if the entirety of their Roma left for other EU countries, there would only be a few thousand arriving in each EU country. Insignificant in the scheme of things.

Additionally you've got to take into account wider society. We all benefit from sending children to school and to education because they become educated and contributing members of society with valuable skills to make use of. Every one benefits from being surrounded by people like that. We don't just send children to school so they can benefit. We send them to school so that we can have better lives also. So if you flip that around, if kids don't go to school then they can easily become a drain on society, stealing from others. 

So that's an extra element to add into the equation, would giving that child a chance to have a decent future + the benefit society has from that child not becoming a thief or worse, before enough to justify taking the child away from its family?

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;It's people who subscribe to the Romani culture who are a problem.

Depends on what parts of Romani culture they subscribe to. There are a lot of Gabor Roma who are quite conservative (patriarchal, isolated from wider comunity, arrage marriages for their children at an early ages, little education, especially for the girls) but are functional members of sociaty more or less. They are skilled craftsmen, (tinkers and such), and rarely cause trouble if ever. (Some of them are embracing Evangelical Christianity and are abandoning arranged marriages and keep their kids in school longer).

From what I've read, the Finnish Gypsies are somewhat like that (keep a lot of customs, but don't cause a lot of trouble and work).

Now there are other Gypsies who are half-assimilated and live in the periphery of big cities. The traditional Roma look down on these Roma as lesser beings. These are Roma who have more in common with ""ghetto culture"" than ""Roma culture"". Or better yet, it's a mixture of the bad in both (thuggishness combined with disconnect from wider society).

The idea if you get rid of a ""bad Roma culture"" things can be fixed is really an oversimplification (though it does have a grain of truth). But the Roma are a very heterogenious ethnicity, and there are different problems with different subgroups.",0,1382114993,null,0,false,0,ccuexli,t3_1opuma,t1_ccuexli,t1_ccudvi3,null,1429085039,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16
true,Gerspan,null,null,"&gt;Of course it is. Austerity is not the goal, its is just a tool to force irresponsible people to learn to act more responsibly

Yeah, ok. Now you're not even attempting to be rational. What's that even supposed to mean? Economic problems are structural, they aren't reliant on someone's personal behaviour, and even if they were they would be reliant on the behaviour of the employers since that's the class that manages the economic units of production and not the employees. 

&gt;That's what austerity is about

Not really. That's some childish vengeful idea you are promoting and which could very well bring the entire EU down along with all its members. Austerity is theoretically a policy aiming to eliminate deficits and what Hayek considered ""unsupported"" growth. Of course it fails on both fronts. But it's not some ridiculous attempt to determine another state's policy and punish its people. That's an offensive interventionalist notion up there with the US ""liberating"" Iraq.

&gt;its a tool for it to learn that certain behaviour is not right

You are either irredeemably stupid or just trolling. So the point is to raise the deficit and debt and thus further destabilise a member state and with it jeopardise the entire european structure *and* yourselves out of some misplaced barbaric urge to punish one of the least influential actors? Let me guess. Raising the debt and destroying that economy will help avoid raising the debt in the future. That's genius thinking, I don't know why I didn't think of it before.

The big controversy seems to be mainly emigration of Roma of recent Eastern Europe origin, who become urban poor elsewhere and make a living through largely criminal endeavors.

Other Roma populations have fairly different situations that I think the same policies wouldn't apply to. For example, there are about 1 million *gitanos* in Spain. There are also socioeconomic problems there, especially in big cities, although most who end up in prison are there for drug trafficking rather than other crimes. The population also isn't a completely separate immigrant population, but has sort of a continuum of integration and intermarriage, and especially outside the large urban centers often lives in towns that have been Roma-populated for centuries. Even a good deal of what is today thought of as Andalusian culture is a hybrid of Spanish and *gitano* culture.

Be it the fact that say germany didn't have to maintain an army for a decade, the fact that they were all former empires (essentially), that they industrialised when the southern states were focusing on agricultural production and so on. I'm not denying corruption may play a small role, but you should know the primary factors influencing productivity are technological advancements and the ability to invest in capital goods, as well as the field of economy they are focusing on. A state focusing on providing services will never accumulate as much wealth as a state focusing on manufacture even if everyone is working like a madman. On the other hand there is a self-perpetuating effect with capital. The more you have the more you can invest in capital goods to raise productivity to produce more wealth and so on. That's not even touching on other factors like the way a free market affects the non industrialised countries which essentially bleed capital towards the industrialised ones unable to even begin to compete with them. And all that is disregarding the more complex structural problems of the eurozone itself that people like Blyth are presenting or the general crisis that was caused by the deregulation of the bond market and destabilised the more fragile economies.

We could be talking about it all day, but the idea that the richer countries have a better work ethic or whatever is simply false. In fact it's so impressively simplistic that it's amazing people actually buy it. Perhaps they like the idea and that's why they do. But it's unfortunately not true. The truth is productivity is rising steadilly in all countries, predictably faster in the countries with easier access to capital goods. that's really all there is to it.

Taking children from their parents is not something which is so evil that it literally trumps all other rights. I think that keeping families together is very important, and that includes Roma families. What I am saying is that there are times where other rights become more important. You know, like a right to an education or a right to freedom. 

Don't just copout and call this suggestion stupid for even being suggested. Tell me why it is wrong. Don't just say Hitler did it. 

Come on, do you think that a child should be kept with its family if its family is not giving it an education, forcing it to marry at a a ridiculously young age and disallowing them from participating in wider society. That's denying them a right to choose their husband/wife, that's denying them part of their child hood by making them marry so young, that's denying them their right to education, that's denying their right to freedom. Don't copout and say that it's stupid to suggest that kids shouldn't be brought up in this kind of a situation. Difficult situations call for difficult solutions.

It's a decision you have to think about and once you make that decision you have to commit and you have to do it properly. If you do not raise your child and give him/her proper chances then you do not deserve to be a parent and you do not deserve to keep your child. That child's right to an education, to freedom and so on outweighs anyone's right to look after that child.

When the EU expanded in 2004 the Home Office estimated that up to 13,000 migrants (from all EU nations combined) would come to the UK a year (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3454469.stm) that would be by now a max of 130,000. Yet now we have over half a million Polish alone.

Remember that Romania's GDP is two fifths that of Poland. What you're saying of how you don't think that many will come over is exactly what was said in 2004.

In 2014 they don't just join Schengen. The UK controls will stop and they will get the legal right to live and work in the UK. ",0,1382122358,null,0,1382133825,0,ccuhv81,t3_1opuma,t1_ccuhv81,t1_ccuf0v5,null,1429083671,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

However, being an employee of the state, a mayor no less, you represent the state and its values. Whatever you think, you can think and say at home within your own four walls. When it comes to your job, the values of the state you represent should guide your actions, your personal values have to take a backseat.

The easily seen lines that connect the mouth and the nose and the large nostrils. On top of that, whilst the skin seems fair on further investigation this is not the typical Germanic(which is not just Germans and it's basically like the kidnapped girl's color) or Mediterranean(which is a darker color type Xavi fr football fans) skin color. It's a pinkish color that I have probably never seen by Europeans. The kidnapped girl is probably the complete opposite.

People need to stop thinking that being blonde with blue eyes is the most European feature. It's all about facial construction.

My conclusion is that this kid is probably a mix between an European  who probably had sex with a Roma prostitute(or not a prostitute) and he managed to pass down the blonde hair and blue eyes.

true,urquan,FRAN,France,"I think we should stop putting all the blame on them. Many people from these communities actually try to integrate, they send their children to school and try to work despite their generally low education level. It is not fair to punish them collectively when there are crimes committed by some members only. It is only natural that they would isolate themselves when we treat them this way.

Secondly, we should obey our own laws. For example in France there is a law which says that every town with more than 5000 inhabitants must provide a terrain where nomad communities can settle for a while. Very few cities actually have this terrain, so they often settle in places with no water, no sanitation which causes a lot of problems. According to another law whenever children go to school the priority must be to allow the scholarship to continue. We are very quick to say they only send their children to school a few days a week and ignore this law. Yet another law which is not enforced is that all expelled persons must be provided with a new place to live, but in practice what happens is that groups of 100+ people are offered 3 hotel rooms for 1 or 2 nights. We have no problem applying the laws we like, but somehow we never feel the need to apply the law which would help with their integration.

Lastly, I think we should stop talking about them like a huge problem. In France for example they are only 17000 according to the official census. Hardly enough to imperil civilization. It's not like they arrived overnight either, but the media decided it was the new public enemy #1.",0,1382126510,null,0,false,0,ccujk3m,t3_1opuma,t1_ccujk3m,t3_1opuma,null,1429082883,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

It's a lovely place to stroll at night, plenty of cool wine/spice/cheese/sweets shops, bars too. Recommendations:

* Café du Marché for well-prepared food and decent wine for a good price—cash only. 
* Cafe Central (across the street) is more expensive (takes Amex) and a bit better quality food, better wine list.
* L'Eclair down the street for a drink with a hip ambiance (glass of wine for as low as 4€ if I remember correctly).

Sort of touristy but worth it stops (all over Paris):

* Café Angelina, Rue de Rivoli. Hot, pricey chocolate that lives up to its reputation.
* Pierre Hermé patisserie. For my money, Ladurée macarons are not as good.
* Berthillon ice cream on Ile St-Louis.
* If you like food, just go to Madeleine and make your way around the church (looks like a Greek temple) and go to all the high-end food shops— Fauchon, Mariage Frères, Hédiard, Maille, nothing but crazy expensive and luxurious products.
* The big department stores, Printemps and Galeries Lafayette. The former is gorgeous on the outside, the latter is *gorgeous* on the inside, and they're right next door to one another.

Do keep in mind, if you're from America— day-to-day living is more expensive, waiters are all paid better, etc, so the bill for drinks is going to add up no matter what you do. The most economical way to skirt this is to pick up a bottle somewhere and pique-nique— but hey, if you like French wine, you're not likely to find better selection at a restaurant at home.

Also, I love mussels (moules) here. Good lord. They might all be from Brittany, or every seafood wholesaler has great connections, but they're just so tender and flavorful and you get to soak all the broth up with bread... There's little better.

I've already seen some signs of this happening in Romania. NGOs and even nascent political movements have started showing up.

Nel primo caso lo stato ha interesse alla punizione dell'autore del reato, indipendentemente dall'opinione della vittima. 

Nel secondo caso, lo stato non ha un proprio interesse alla punizione dell'autore del reato, e protremmo dire che lascia la decisione alla vittima.

L'atto con cui si informa lo stato del fatto che è stato commesso un reato si chiama denuncia.

Lo strumento giuridico con la vittima chiede allo stato che venga punito l'autore del reato si chiama querela. (Nella prassi la vittima normalmente fa le due cose insieme, e l'atto viene chiamato ""denuncia-querela"").

La differenza pratica sta nel fatto che nel caso dei reati perseguibili d'ufficio il procedimento penale segue il suo corso anche se la vittima rimane inerte, mentre nel caso di reati perseguibili a querela no.

Normalmente può essere revocata: questo accade quando l'autore del reato e la vittima trovano un accordo, che tipicamente prevede un risarcimento economico per la vittima.

Esiste una terza possibilità: i reati perseguibili a querela per i quali la querela non è revocabile. Per questi reati lo stato lascia alla vittima la scelta se dare inizio al procedimento oppure no, ma ritiene che una volta iniziato il procedimento penale questo debba sempre arrivare a termine. Esempio classico di questa categoria di reati è la violenza sessuale.

Che io sappia nessuno ha mai dubitato della costituzionalità dell'irrevocabilità della querela.

Ne, Ernst beiseite.

Gibt wirklich sehr, sehr viele Underground Rapper, die u.a. aus der VBT Szene sich einen Namen machten, zB Sorgenkind, 3plusss, Mikzn70, Primatune (Pat Riot, Fid Rizz).

Ansonsten sehr geil: Dcvdns hat ebenfalls **sehr** geile Underground tracks produziert und bringt immer noch krasse Sachen, ansonsten ist KIZ für den aufgeschlossen, humoristischen, gerne auch sarkastischen und zynischen Menschen, sicherlich ein Muss.

257ers auch ganz geil, ansonsten sollte auch Peter Fox und dementsprechend Seeed mehr oder weniger ein Klassiker sein.

Um OP's Frage zu beantworten:

Ich jedenfalls gebe mir gerne die Sachen von einigen Underground Rappern, besonders hervorheben tu ich jetzt einfach mal das da: [Mikzn70 - Frei ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XD9CEa_lR4)

The reason I find it disgusting is because I don't find it any different than wiping out a culture by mass extermination. Either way you're wiping out an entire way of life and interpreting the world. You don't *pick* a culture, it evolves over centuries and millenia through shared history, shared opinions, shared experiences.

Culture is the only reason humanity is where it is today, the only reason it's possible for any of us to have a formal education or a decent quality of life. Tribes originated from people having a shared culture; shared experiences, values and opinions. From tribes we get villages, towns, cities, eventually onto nations and international organisations. 

In other words, it's something that brings people together and when people come together 'economy of scale' applies, not just in terms of economics, but in all aspects of innovation and creativity, the only things that set humans apart from other animals.

The reason that happens isn't because you have a lot of people doing and thinking the same, insect colonies can do that too; the reason it happens is because you have more and more people with different opinions and values contributing to and shaping the larger culture. 

That's why individual human life is valued so much, for our personalities, our individual values and opinions and our unique way of looking at life. Culture is exactly the same thing but on a much larger scale.

When you kill a person, it's despicable because you've destroyed a personality (values, opinions, a unique way of interpreting life).

No. Leggi *tu* l'art. 609-septies c.p.

Sì, ma *non* nel caso di violenza sessuale su infradiciottenne.

""Vizi di forma"" ? Non mi è chiaro cosa intendi. Fammi un esempio di *vizio di forma*, per favore.

Continui a fare confusione. La questione è che la querela è *irrilevante* nel caso di violenza sessuale su infradiciottenne, non che non possa essere ritirata.

Une famille italienne qui se dit qu'en France, elle pourra non pas travailler mais avoir plus d'aides et donc ment sur son identité. Ce ne sont pas ""les immigrés"". 

&gt;sur le ""peu de désir de s'intégrer"" : la jeune fille était scolarisée, en France depuis près de cinq ans, francophone... A l'évidence sa vie future était ici. Expulsée elle ne pourra plus guère s'intégrer, même si elle le souhaitait. Un peu comme les roms, qu'on trimballe d'une commune à l'autre, pour ensuite leur reprocher d'être ""inassimilables"".

Stratégie dictée par les associations pour donner des arguments face au juge. C'est du bluff pour rester jusqu'aux cinq ans et avoir un titre de séjour. Mais bon, je veux bien t'accorder qu'au moins, ils ne sont pas en train de détrousser des touristes parisiens. 

&gt;sur le respect des lois de la République : certes le père a menti. C'est mal, mais c'est un peu court pour parler d'""aucun respect"". On connait des Français qui ne respectent pas les lois de la République, et à un tout autre niveau de mensonge, de fraude et de préjudice pour le pays. Les pouvoirs publics semblent moins pressés de sévir. Plus facile d'être fermes avec les petites gens.

Pourquoi devrait-on permettre à des menteurs et des délinquants sans emploi de rester en France ? Quant à tes autres ""délinquants"" qui vivent dans l'impunité, c'est une belle distraction, la loi est la même pour tous. Si tu connais d'autres délinquants qui ne sont pas arrêtés, tu peux faire les démarches ou alerter l'opinion. 

&gt;Bien sûr que les immigrés viennent pour ""profiter"" - de conditions de vie (ou de survie) potentiellement meilleures que chez eux. 

De la gratuité du système oui. Pendant ce temps là, 70% des bénéficiaires potentiels du RSA ne font pas valoir leurs droits. 

&gt;Pourquoi des millions de gens sont-ils partis aux Etats-Unis? 

Tu parles des Etats-Unis d'Ellis Island ou des Etats-Unis des miradors à la frontière mexicaine. Les premiers sont anachroniques, les seconds n'ont guère de leçons à nous donner. 

&gt;Cela a-t-il empêché le pays de devenir la première économie du monde, ou n'est-ce pas plutôt grâce à cela?

C'est grâce à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, qui n'a aucun rapport avec l'immigration clandestine. Merci d'ouvrir un livre d'histoire avant d'ouvrir la bouche. 

&gt;""Profiter"" ne signifie pas non plus ne rien apporter en échange.

Ronflant, vide, abstrait. Tu vas pas me faire une dissert sur la sémiologie du verbe profiter. Et tu pourrais développer sur ce qui est apporté ici.  

&gt;Et encore une fois, on en connait qui ""profitent"" à un tout autre niveau, en toute impunité ou presque. 

Ah si, en fait. Donc profiteurs = malfaiteurs ? 

&gt;Au hasard : Cahuzac, Depardieu, Tapie, Sarkozy, Strauss-Kahn... 

L'instant diffamation. Si t'as des preuves contre Depardieu, Sarkozy ou Strauss-Kahn, libre à toi de les faire parvenir aux autorités compétentes. Niveau moins dix de l'argument. 

&gt;Et pour finir, même si la France était dans son droit (c'est de toutes façons le droit du plus fort), la méthode, elle, est répugnante et rappelle des scènes d'une autre époque.

Question de point de vue. Probablement le point de vue de quelqu'un qui n'a jamais eu à faire à la police.

See, that's basically my point. Enforcing truancy on people who refuse to participate eats up time. You spend time finding them, bringing them in and enforcing the law on them. All of that equals money. Same goes for government housing. Europe lacks the will to commit to the Euros or the iron fist approach it would take to ensure the next generation of Roma doesn't end up like the last.

First things first, when you round them up, don't send them off to some neighboring country. Tell them to go live in the government housing, or live in the government prisons on vagrancy charges. If they leave the government housing and are then rounded up, give them a month or two non-optional jail time (vagrancy again), take custody of their children and put them back in government housing, this time without their children.

When those children grow up, some, probably a lot, will return to their old ways, but some will integrate successfully. From there, this new growing class of integrated, educated Roma will either change Roma culture from within, or if they are ostracized from their old community, begin forming a new subculture by rebelling against their parents.

It's pretty rubbish in big cities of Western Europe when compared to Prague.

If you see your metro just leaving the platform in Prague, you don't care because the next one is going to be there in 2-3 minutes (max. 10 minutes on the weekend).

If I see the U- or S-Bahn just leaving the platform anywhere in Germany, I'll use some of my best swearwords because the next one will be in 20 minutes if I'm lucky. And if I have to change services, I might be looking at another 30 minutes waiting time.

My flatmate in Prague had a girlfriend who lived somewhere way out in the outskirts of Prague (like ""Take the Metro to the terminus, change to a bus and then change to another bus to get there"" way out). But there still was a bus every 10 minutes during the day.

I'm staying at my parents place at the moment, which is in a similar location near a German city that is not as big as Prague but still. There is a bus ONCE per hour that will take me to the train station and there are trains every 40 minutes. Which narrows down travel options pretty quick.

4. You've also forgot how London's population practically doubles every day as people travel in to work/visit.
5. We can also use perspective to see that over the same five years 35,000 Poles were the most arrested foreign nationality out of a population of half a million in the UK.
6. At the same time the Romanians came in as the second most arrested nationality in London at 28,000 arrests out of a population of 68,000
7. And you've also assumed that all these Romanians live in London, they don't.

The Romanian population is vastly overrepresented.

Assuming for a moment they do all live in London from your own data we can see they have an arrest rate that is at least twice as high as found in the area of the UK that arrests most of it's population.

&gt;Estimates regarding the rape of Soviet women by the Wehrmacht reached up to 10,000,000 cases, with between 750,000 and 1,000,000 children born as a result.[68][70][71][72]

Meanwhile, the top estimates of Soviet rapes in Eastern Europe are 2 million, and that's based entirely on abortion statistics after the war, which is nonsensical as abortions were illegal under Hitler. The real number is much smaller. 

Furthermore, rape of civilians was illegal and punishable by death in the Red Army.

An order issued on January 19, 1945 and signed by Stalin said,

&gt;Officers and men of the Red Army! We are entering the country of the enemy... the remaining population in the liberated areas, regardless of whether they're German, Czech, or Polish, should not be subjected to violence. The perpetrators will be punished according to the laws of war. In the liberated territories, sexual relations with females are not allowed. Pepetrators of violence and rape will be shot.[25]

In the Wehrmacht, however, rape of non-German civilians was not punished in any capacity.

&gt;Rapes were allowed in practice by the German military in eastern and southeastern Europe, while northern and western countries were relatively spared.[62][63] Historian Szymon Datner wrote in his work about the fate of POWs taken by the Wehrmacht, that thousands of Soviet female nurses, doctors and field medics fell victim to rape when captured, and were often murdered afterwards.[33] Ruth Seifert in War and Rape. Analytical Approaches wrote: ""in the Eastern territories the Wehrmacht used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women – and other women as well – with the words ""Whore for Hitler's troops"" and to use them accordingly.""[64]

&gt;Birgit Beck in her work Rape: The Military Trials of Sexual Crimes Committed by Soldiers in the Wehrmacht, 1939–1944 describes the leniency in punishing sex crimes by German authorities in the East, at the same time pointing out heavy punishments applied in the West.[65] If a soldier who committed a rape was subsequently convicted by a court-martial, he would usually be sentenced to four years in prison.[66] The German penal code was also valid for soldiers in war.[67]

&gt;Rapes were rarely prosecuted in practice; in Denmark German rapes were not widespread, and German officials promised to punish them.[62] Rape by Germans of non-German women was not taken seriously, nor was it punishable by death, especially in the eastern European territories.[68]

&gt;In Soviet Russia rapes were only a concern if they undermined military discipline.[65] The German military command viewed them as another method of crushing Soviet resistance.[68] Since 1941, rape was theoretically punishable with the death sentence; however, this only concerned the rape of German women and was intended to protect German communities.[68]

&gt;Estimates regarding the rape of Soviet women by the Wehrmacht reached up to 10,000,000 cases, with between 750,000 and 1,000,000 children born as a result.[68][70][71][72]

Meanwhile, the top estimates of Soviet rapes in Eastern Europe are 2 million, and that's based entirely on abortion statistics after the war, which is nonsensical as abortions were illegal under Hitler. The real number is much smaller. 

Furthermore, rape of civilians was illegal and punishable by death in the Red Army.

An order issued on January 19, 1945 and signed by Stalin said,

&gt;Officers and men of the Red Army! We are entering the country of the enemy... the remaining population in the liberated areas, regardless of whether they're German, Czech, or Polish, should not be subjected to violence. The perpetrators will be punished according to the laws of war. In the liberated territories, sexual relations with females are not allowed. Pepetrators of violence and rape will be shot.[25]

In the Wehrmacht, however, rape of non-German civilians was not punished in any capacity.

&gt;Rapes were allowed in practice by the German military in eastern and southeastern Europe, while northern and western countries were relatively spared.[62][63] Historian Szymon Datner wrote in his work about the fate of POWs taken by the Wehrmacht, that thousands of Soviet female nurses, doctors and field medics fell victim to rape when captured, and were often murdered afterwards.[33] Ruth Seifert in War and Rape. Analytical Approaches wrote: ""in the Eastern territories the Wehrmacht used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women – and other women as well – with the words ""Whore for Hitler's troops"" and to use them accordingly.""[64]

&gt;Birgit Beck in her work Rape: The Military Trials of Sexual Crimes Committed by Soldiers in the Wehrmacht, 1939–1944 describes the leniency in punishing sex crimes by German authorities in the East, at the same time pointing out heavy punishments applied in the West.[65] If a soldier who committed a rape was subsequently convicted by a court-martial, he would usually be sentenced to four years in prison.[66] The German penal code was also valid for soldiers in war.[67]

&gt;Rapes were rarely prosecuted in practice; in Denmark German rapes were not widespread, and German officials promised to punish them.[62] Rape by Germans of non-German women was not taken seriously, nor was it punishable by death, especially in the eastern European territories.[68]

&gt;In Soviet Russia rapes were only a concern if they undermined military discipline.[65] The German military command viewed them as another method of crushing Soviet resistance.[68] Since 1941, rape was theoretically punishable with the death sentence; however, this only concerned the rape of German women and was intended to protect German communities.[68]",0,1382145432,null,0,false,0,ccupxjp,t3_1op547,t1_ccupxjp,t1_ccu8eab,null,1429079880,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

So americans are mostly seen as capitalist basic guys (-rednecks), thinking about money only and not knowing how to appreciate the good things of life (= enjoying good food and taking your time :D). That is basically for people that have never been or known any americans, the big standart image.

As for those taht have been there, they find you at large pretty sympathic, they take counscious of the life differences and can understand it (but food is still a big issue, I mean 15 days of pizzas and burgers and no smelly cheese... common :D ). They appreciate the fact that you are always thinking positively and willing to go forward. If we work with you the fact that you can not be emotive and all has to look all great on surface even if it's bullshit is felt as a hypocrite way of doing things. 

Anyway Frenchs and Americans are kinda like opposite cultures it's a love/hate situation where frenchs will say things about americans but will always want to visit this gigantic and mind opening country.

Who cares about all this shit, amirite? A Pole and a German are worth 10 Russian untermenschen. 

Soviet ""occupation"":

&gt;Prior to World War II, education in Poland was limited. According to official statistics of the time, the number of children who did not attend school in the 1935-1936 school year was 600,000 out of a total of 5,143,100 children of school age. In the 1937-1938 year only 127,100 finished seventh grade, and only 36,400 of these students were from rural areas. All secondary schools, even public ones, charged high tuition fees that many Poles simply could not afford. This meant that only 11.1% of schoolchildren would go on past primary school.

&gt;In order to be able to admit all children to the seven-year schools outlined in 1948, a campaign to expand the school network was undertaken. So many new schools were built (4,834 new classrooms in 1956 alone) that the government could, and indeed did, pass a law mandating the maximum distance between a child's home and their school. For students in grades one to four a school had to be within 3 kilometers of their home, and for students in grades five to seven, within 4 kilometers of their home.

&gt;In 1956, a detailed study by the Central Statistical Office declared that every single mentally and physically healthy Polish child received an education. Special schools were set up for deaf, mute or blind children. Altogether, up to 5,650,000 students completed primary schooling in Poland between 1945 and 1963.

He didn't have to prove anything.  The ""birther"" movement, which claims that Obama is a Kenyan Muslim, is a subset of the Tea Party movement.  They are racists who cannot openly complain about Obama being black, so they use code language: ""Kenyan,"" is pretty obvious; ""Muslim,"" in the US, is a religion that some associate with blacks.

Donald Trump began to champion this cause as a way of getting attention when he was half-seriously running for the Republican presidential nomination.  That put the spotlight on the Birthers and made their cause appear more important than it actually was.

It was just loudmouthed idiots venting racism in a coded manner.

Obama put Trump in his place at the White House Correspondent's Dinner, which is an event where the US president often stands up to do a comedy routine.  It's really good.

What I wonder is if there are any positive examples where Roma live a productive ""Roma life"" somewhat in harmony with the world around them. Then those conditions should be studied and the various host societies should take care that the same conditions exist where Roma live.

If such conditions do exist they definitely don't exist in Graz/Austria. Most of the time I argue on the side of the Roma, because political proposal are particularly retarded and short sighted here ... banning begging and such ... first I'd like to know if they have other options.

On a personal level I am not happy about the Roma here.

There might also be courses that are partially (or mostly)  taught in English. Use [this]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Germany ) as a starting point. Go to the university website, find the list of offered programs and look at the individual pages for those programs. I found this method to be much more helpful than going through daad.de or study-in.de, although these helped initially when I started my search. 
You can also look at Fachhochschulen. 

Look around for information system type programs, which are usually more applied in nature than theoretical computer science programs. It might be helpful to mention what your undergrad major was, why you want to switch to computers, if you have relevant work experience, what do you want to do with a degree in computers (industry or academia), etc.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"Here's the problem.  Every US election has two parts:

1.  The primary.  This first part is an intra-party election.  Each party has one.  Republicans vote in Republican primaries and Democrats vote in Democratic primaries.  For whichever party has an incumbent, the primary will usually be a rubber stamp.  For the party that is fielding a challenger, the primary will often be a vigorous election with as many as 7 or 8 candidates.

2.  The general election.  Every American adult who is eligible to vote can vote in this election.  The Democrat who was chosen by the Democratic primary faces off against the Republican who was chosen by the Republican primary.

A moderate Republican would probably do well in the general election, partly for the reason you gave in your post, but not in the primary election.  That's because the people who vote in primaries are typically the party's most motivated members.  Because of the Tea Party movement, the most motivated Republicans in most states are radicals.  Arnold would have to adopt Tea Party positions to win their votes.  I can't see him actually becoming a Tea Partier, and I hope he wouldn't fake it like McCain and Romney did; I can't imagine him being that phony.

Another thing to note is that the Tea Partiers typically react to a political loss, such as their recent utter defeat by Obama in the stand-off over the debt ceiling, by demanding even more radical and stubborn politicians.

I'm not sure I agree with the statement that the biggest reason for why the rail project is moving at the current pace is due to bickering between the three nations, there seem to be perfectly logical explanations why it has taken the time it has...  
Frankly this article seems to be pulled out of somewhat of a thin air, there's not enough substance but apparently they deemed the topic interesting enough to write something about it.

However, about the bickering, I don't think many Europeans grasp how different the three countries actually are in many ways... Even the term ""Baltic states"" was artificially coined at the start of 20th century and first included Finland. There are many reasons why each of the three countries may see the idea of such a railway differently, local Russians in Latvia might feel it necessary to further connections to Russia (and they wouldn't be wrong economic wise at least), Lithuania has already started to rebuild some of their railways to connect with Poland, etc.

**Combien d'est là de résistance à la culture américaine?** 
C'est plus de la résistance à la Mondialisation, qu'une résistance à la culture américaine en soi. Et il faudrait pas oublier que ce que vous appelez ""culture américaine"", c'est de la culture européenne modifiée... Plus beaucoup d'armes à feu, et de patriotisme. 

**Aussi, combien de l'arte americain (cinéma, litterature, musique) est en France?**

Cinéma : Très présent, je pense que j'ai vu plus de films américains (Hollywood) que Français. D'un autre côté, les films sont diffusés en VF, et comme l'a dit An0k, il y'a des lois pour promouvoir les films Français. Et le festival le plus connu reste le festival de Canne. 

Littérature : ""A song of Ice and fire"", ""Twilight"", ""The hunger games"" ? Peut être plus lus que certains ""classiques"", mais ces livres sont toujours moins lus que Harry Potter (UK). Le facteur le plus important au final, c'est que **les gens lisent de moins en moins de livres...** 
A noter, les mangas prennent une plus en plus grande place, à côté, les comics books venus des US font pâle figure. Je crois qu'après le Japon, la France est le pays où on lit le plus de manga. Et on a toujours la BD Française/Européenne. 

Musique : Mitigé. La musique des USA est pas encore tout à fait ""dominante"". Ca représente une grosse part, mais tout ne vient pas de chez vous, loin de là. Par exemple, en Rap, on fait la distinction ""rap français"", ""rap US"". 

Point important, en vérité, c'est plus le capitalisme qui se répand. 
Pendant que L' Europe était en Guerre, vous étiez loin en train d'exploiter vos immenses ressources naturelles. 
Pendant que la Russie récupérait de la Guerre contre les Nazis (Oublions pas que ce sont eux qui ont vraiment gagné la Guerre en Europe), vous aidiez à reconstruire la France, l'Angleterre, une partie de l'Allemagne, etc...  
Et puis vous avez été les premiers à faire beaucoup de choses, même si d'autre pays les aurait accomplis peu de temps après.

Et puis, la France a plus influencée les USA, que les USA ont influencés la France... (Enfin, plutôt l'Europe en général) La statue de la liberté ? Made in France. Votre indépendance ? Si la France ne vous avez pas aidé militairement, mais aussi en étant juste à 25Km de la Grande Bretagne, prêt à attaquer, auriez vous réussi ? 

Et y'a certaines chose restant bien mieux en Europe. 
Votre Assurance Maladie (ObamaCare) est considérée comme une chose normale à avoir.

At some point, yeah.  The question is when.  It won't happen as long as the GOP is led by the radicals in the House.  It won't happen if Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio remain their top candidates for 2016.

If the House GOP changes in 2014, I might change my prediction.  If Ted Cruz and his allies suffer a dramatic fall in popularity among the GOP base, I might change my prediction.

&gt;Germans raped and killed many times more Soviet citizens than vice versa, and were completely unprovoked, whereas Soviet war crimes were a form of revenge against much worse atrocities.

The Holocoust had 6 million victims, the great leap forward killed ~40 million people, after your logic the murdering of these jews was okay because there were other atrocities that were much worse.

&gt;a form of revenge against much worse atrocities

The Russians basically HAD to rape these women, right. Killing for revenge doesnt make it better. Also, raping POLISH women not German.

It's a decent guideline for what to include, but no more than that.

Your German CV must be thorough and include every work experience and education you have. No unexplained gaps in your timeline (even if you worked in professions totally unrelated to what you want to do now - list them, all of them)! I also prefer CVs where an applicant lists their main responsibilities and possibly success stories beneath each stint in their career (bullet points are sufficient). Your CV is the most important document in any German application, especially if you have no written letters of recommendation (try to get these from former employers, if you can!). Take your time, put effort and work into your Lebenslauf and make it your own, but cut back on the ""creativity"" and fancy layouts.

The «already» is a preconceived opinion. It only looks true because we are more fortunate not to have to institutionalize as many children as in the past, thanks to fertility control.

&gt; Coming from a culture that deprives it's members of education, stability, actively encourages crime, promotes sexual abuse, etc... Is worse for a child than institutionalisation I would argue.

In the US, we normally get a bachelors, work and then go back for a masters degree. So, in that respect, some programs in US will have students with more maturity and work experience. At least, this is the case for International Relations and business programs. Science degrees might be completely different though. Not too sure how it is structured.

&gt; ""Ich bin ein Mann, Baby

&gt;Saug mir das Testo aus der Brust

&gt;Der Männername beim Sex ist mir nur rausgerutscht

&gt;Ich schwöre, ich bin nicht schwul (auf gar keinen Fall!)

&gt;Ich hab es ausprobiert

&gt;Keiner fässt meine Schwester an - außer mir""

&amp;

&gt;Ich bin der Eine, bei dem die Hände auf der Bettdecke liegen

&gt;Wichsen ist für mich tabu, denn das wäre Sex mit nem Typen

&gt;Und ich bin ja nicht schwul

&gt;Fick Frauen zuerst in den Arsch

&gt;Und darf erst dann abspritzen, wenn der Regisseur es mir sagt

&gt;Ich bin so hetero, manchmal wenn ich geil bin wie Sau

&gt;Fick ich sogar meine eigene Frau!

&gt;Und ich kann nicht mal meine Waschmaschiene selbst bedienen

&gt;Für mich sind Heteros ehrenlos, ich kann's nicht checken

&gt;Wie kann man da, wo man raus kam, seinen Schwanz rein stecken

&amp;

&gt;Verfraute Gesellschaft, nichts passiert aus Zufall

&gt;Sie wollen uns außer Gefecht setzen mit Bier und Fußball

&gt;Und ner eigenen Sprache ""Mascara, Eyeliner""

&gt;Und was das sein soll weiß keiner, scheiß Weiber

- Oui. Certains ont quitté la France depuis plus de 15-20 ans et n'ont pas connu l'euro, par exemple.

Besides, 1400 euro in a Western European city will be difficult to live on, unless, say, you're using it to rent a place and then dumpster-diving for food.
Eastern and Southern Europe - the countries not yet in the EU or Schengen zone - will be cheap and pleasant, if a bit hot during the summer(Balkans). HelpX, as someone mentioned before, is a great option. Check out the website. It's 20 euros for a 2-year membership, and you have access to the global database, not just one country or Europe. Theoretically, you could spend those three-and-a-half months without spending **any** of your 1400 euros, if you use HelpX and move from nearby host to nearby host. They give you food and accommodation in exchange for 4-6 hours of work per day, and you can read the reviews of the hosts left by previous helpers, which you can't do on WWOOF(where you also have to pay by country). 

HelpX really would be my choice, because summer is no time to be spending your life in a city(in Southern Europe, at least).

* At the root of Mr. Provopoulos’s defense is his view that at the time of the deal, in March 2010, Mr. Lavrentiadis had a strong enough reputation as a businessman to be approved as a new bank owner in Greece. This was not, however, an opinion that was shared by the head of Cyprus’s central bank, who rejected an attempt by Mr. Lavrentiadis to buy a bank in Cyprus during the same period, contending his finances were questionable. 

*  The Proton deal was announced on Dec. 29, 2009. The next day, Mr. Lavrentiadis wired 71 million euros to Piraeus, according to the prosecutor’s report — even though the sale had not been formally approved by the central bank’s regulatory division.As weeks passed without a nod from regulators, Mr. Lavrentiadis became worried that he would never gain control of the bank. Mr. Lavrentiadis told prosecutors that he met with Mr. Sallas, the Piraeus chairman, in late March and said that he had decided to pull out of the deal. “Don’t do that,” Mr. Sallas replied, according to Mr. Lavrentiadis’s account. “Let me call my good friend George Provopoulos, and he will do what is needed to get this deal cleared.” 

Finally, your refutation completely misses the ongoing political backstabbing game that is being played out, or as the article puts it, the ""murky give-and-take among bankers, business leaders and government officials that has long been par for the course in Greece"".

Racism, after all, is the belief that races can be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to others, or that members of different races should be treated differently. Depicting Zwarte Piet with stereotypical features such as thick, red lips and curly hair doesn't make it racist. Nobody is establishing superiority or inferiority, just like saying that Dutch people are tall and like cheese is stereotypical, but not racist.

That being said, I agree with the rest of your post. Zwarte Piet is a happy figure. He makes children laugh, and gives them candy and presents. The idea that using a black figure as a servant or helper of a white figure somehow promotes racism, slavery, or whatever is, in my eyes, nonsensical. Sinterklaas is an old tradition and he has had black servants for a long time. This simply happened in the past and changing Zwarte Piet now  would not be ""politically correct"", it would be historically inaccurate. It would be denying our past. It would be lying to ourselves.

In any case here's my story: sometimes, people here can be assholes and your only recourse is just to be an asshole back at them. Now if you're a theology and philosophy grad who now teaches religion that may sound rather disconcerting, but it's just a weird little thing that can frustrate you until you've learned to deal with it. For example, say some guy on the train next to you is sitting with his knees open and totally hogging your legroom, or a gaggle of schoolgirls is slowly parading up a staircase four abreast in front of you. A simple, understated, English-style clearing of the throat or 'pardon me (Entschuldigung)' won't do. You'll have to say in a stern or exasperated tone, ""you're encroaching upon my legroom"" bzw. ""may I get through please?"" to get a response. It's weird.

Secondly, it's expensive here. Of course one can get by on a meager student budget of EUR 700-900 per month, but whenever you leave the routine of cooking your own meals, staying in, and not taking intercity rail trips around the country/continent, the sticker shock hits. First in terms of base purchasing power, a Euro is worth more than a dollar, but a product that costs $5 in the US often costs EUR 5 in Germany just the same. It takes a lot of discipline to make yourself, for every price you see, multiply it by 1.3 or so and then conclude ""ok, so that's how much it *really* costs."" If you don't do that you'll see your dollar-denominated savings suffer accordingly.

Or, your savings could still suffer without your even lifting a finger! The Euro is worth something like close $1.36 now, which is way up there.

Many wild/""crazy"" things that you can do in the US are not possible/illegal. In the US, if you want to play paintball, you probably just find some abandoned place, some woodland, a field or whatever and play. In Germany, forget about it. Unless you have an indoor hall or something, you aren't going to play paintball. Just as an example.

Just pitching up a tent somewhere in the wild? *Maybe* legal, maybe not.

All the regulations here are not really a big deal for us who live here, because we are used to them, but they are much more restrictive than in the US, so for someone used to the US, it might be annyoing. Sunday means shops are closed. It's the law. You cannot open a shop that is open on Sunday. Want to drive a car? It better be road-safe by some pretty high standards. Want to get a drivers license? Mandatory driving school with strict theoretical and practical tests, costs 2000 EUR+. ""Free speech"" is not as unlimited as it is in the US. It will probably not affect you, but if you try to pull off somethings like a Westboro Baptist Church protest here, or explain to people that the Holocaust didn't happen, things won't go well.

Also, taxes (and the taxes/insurance to be paid by the employer when employing people) are probably *much* higher than in the US. Associated buerocracy is also an issue, especially if you want to start a business. You probably *really* don't want to do that, at least not until you are fluent in German and know how the tax system etc. works.

There is even a legal right to these Arbeitszeugnisse. They document your responsibilities and your former employer makes statements about your conduct, work ethic, your value to the company etc. 

These Zeugnisse are a part of any application by a German person and are handed to HR along with a CV and a motivation letter at the start of an interview process. Ideally, you have a Zeugnis for everything you claim in your CV (certificates from school - uni - internships - employments), again with no gaps in the time line. 

On the other hand, reference calls or getting references without the applicant's consent are very uncommon in Germany and would be considered rude and an intrusion (aside from very unreliable). I have only made two or three reference calls in my career, all for sales positions and where the impression from the other documents was extremely shaky.

Now, as a foreign applicant  who works in Germany for the first time, you will of course not be able to produce Arbeitszeugnisse. Therefore, collect letters of recommendation instead and keep the originals. Sending copies to companies is perfectly fine. In IT, there should not be a need to get them translated to German.

Of course, I can't speak for the entire continent, but I lived there for over half a decade and never met anyone with a dryer. I knew a guy who almost bought himself one, but decided against it because they take up a lot of room and most apartments aren't really equipped for one. Washers generally reside in the kitchen, bathroom, or cellar. 

One of my apartments had a washer in the cellar, and even though there was room for a dryer, there wasn't one. That's right, the tenants from 30 apartments utilizing a single washing machine. These apartments were TINY though. It wasn't *that* big of a deal once you got used to it, but definitely an inconvenience. You get used to your towels being stiff, and your apartment will get dustier (which I speculate is all the clothing particles that normally end up in the lint catcher). BUT it's better for some of your cloths because dryers can beat them up pretty good. Then again, I was always frustrated that my tee-shirts would lose their neck elastic and look like shit. I think this is because I would use too hot of water. It's Celsius, so you might think 80° or 90° is sufficient, but that is basically boiling your shit. Then you might decide to set the spin cycle to 1000RPM to dry better, which will just stretch them all out and cause a bunch of wrinkles. Nowadays, I set it to 30°, maybe 40° and 600 or 800RPM. Oh, and you may want to incorporate ironing if you don't already. I never bothered, but sometimes my shit was wrinkly from the drying rack. Or you'd have a fold line across your chest where the t-shirt was hanging over the rack and dried that way.

Most places would give you a little training if it is your first time. I am not fluent in German but I taught English here. In many cases it is a shit job but, as I said before, it can get you into the country. I know people who work in the international news business and it is not all it is cracked up to be. There are a lot of people already working in that field and it can be tough, not necessarily competitive but there are just a lot of people involved. 

The more education you have the better you are in the German system. Experience doesn't necessarily count if it is not part of you field. To me this makes little sense but they are very bureaucratic here. Documentation and certification is loved in Germany.

 If you really want to be here, you can always look into educational opportunities. www.daad.de is a helpful site. Germany might not be the best to land a job but it is a great place for education. As an undergrad most schooling is free except for the 300 euros or so for fees per semester. 

Just to give you an idea about what it takes to get a job in Germany I will try to give a description of the system. 

For a foreigner from outside of the EU from a non-asylum seeking country, you must prove that you are not taking a job away from a German. There are all sorts of ways they calculate this information but the easiest is getting a job that requires **native language speaker proficiency**. This sort of stuff is key to access the system. Additionally, you  must be hired/invited before you get a long term (more than 3 months) visa. 

Given your current educational background (no I won't mention what that is), you should look for a way in through that field. There are certain places, especially certain schools, that would probably be happy to have someone in your field. To be honest, I can not be certain about that as I do not have experience in that specific field.

As a word of advice, you will be marketing yourself and you must make the case that you are good at what you do. Even if that is only teaching English. Take some time to review how people learn English. Most of it is about understanding who you are teaching and getting them to talk about it while helping them. Learning a language with a person teaching you is not about memorization, it is about learning to communicate in that language (keep that in mind while you learn German).

Rents vary widely based on what part of the country you're in, whether you're in a big city, medium-sized city, or small city, live downtown, in the suburbs, or in a village, are close to public transportation, or need to bike/walk to a bus to a train to get into town. Could be anywhere from 200-800+ Euros/month. But another popular option for foreigners who aren't earning much is a rented room in a shared apartment (Wohngemeinschaft, or WG), which is cheaper than a studio and can come prefurnished. Also as a rule, pretty much the whole country is safe by American standards.

Public transportation is indeed stellar. I've been in this city for three weeks and in a passenger car but once: a taxi from the main train station to my dorm upon arrival because I had a lot of luggage.

They tell their bank ""give me X money from this account"". Their bank tells your bank ""give us X money from this account for this account"". Your bank deducts and transfers the money.

You now have a certain amount of time (changes from time to time, I think it's currently 8 weeks) to contest the charge at your bank. Your bank now returns your money, no questions asked, and has to attempt to get the money back from the other bank. If they fail at that, it's their problem, but since banks rarely disappear, this doesn't happen. So now the other guy's bank is out of money, and needs to get the guy to repay them.

And since they take a risk, in order to be able to do Bankeinzug, you need a contract with the bank. This is similar to a loan. If the bank would be willing to lend you 20,000 EUR, then they will give you a contract that allows you to collect 20,000 EUR per 8 weeks. If you make 20,000 EUR worth of fradulent Bankeinzüge, and run off with the money, it's the same as if you took up a loan and ran off with the money.

Bankeinzug is convenient as hell (just enter two numbers), secure as hell for the customer (trouble with the merchant? get your money back within 8 weeks and now they have to sue you instead of you having to sue them), cheap (for the merchant - no or minimal fees), and usually if you pay something by Bankeinzug, it's considered instantly paid so you won't have to wait for the transfer to clear before the goods are shipped. It prevents loss/trouble with customers who honestly just forget to pay or mess up on the transfer (e.g. forget to put their customer number in the subject field so you cannot find out who paid you).

true,thelittlebig,NISA,Niedersachsen,"Girls: They are not opposed to American guys, I personally know a few with an American SO. But dating is way less formal and less ritualized. If you are used to the American dating cutlure Germany might confuse you with it's more organic (albeit also more confusing) approach to dating. Girls might be more assertive and will approach people they are interested in. Attention: There is WAY LESS grinding and twerking in German clubs. 

Public transport: Germans would say that it is very different from city to city and state to state, but that it is all awful and to expensive. They would also claim that the Deutsche Bahn hasn't had a train arrive on time since the days of the Kaiserreich.   
Compared to most places in America (excepting NYC, etc.) it is heavenly and quite affordable, though. Especially for students who can travel basically for free. (I pay like 180€/year and can use everything in the city and its sorroundings for free otherwise)  
If you want to actually work here and not be a student than I would still get a car.

Rent: Just like in the USA it varies a lot. Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and Freiburg are possibly among the most expensive cities in Germany. And I would expect to pay anywhere between 500€ (very cheap) to 1000€ (more than one bedroom) in rent. I have a friend in Berlin though who pays 300€ (including heat and electricity) for 860 squarefeet (80m2). That is quite competitive I'd say.

Now to your first question: 

There is a lot that comes into it. American small talk often felt dishonest and like a bother to me. Inefficient and a waste of time would be another way to describe it. When I returned to Germany after a prolonged stay in the USA the official checking my passport only said one word to me: ""Passport!"". His American counterpart had talked about the weather, my stay in the USA, Iowa, my hobbies and more. I enjoyed my interaction with the German guy more. That might have been, because I had been bombarded with American politeness for so long, though.  

You see, Germans aren't polite, but they are in my experience very friendly. Just as friendly as the people in most other nations I have ever been to. But we are very direct, not very pc and we aren't afraid to discuss controversial topics with complete strangers. We also tend to stare at other people a lot. Many foreigners think we stare because they look different, but that isn't the case, we just stare at people in general. 

All of this can seem and actually be very, very rude. I grew up with it though and wouldn't want it any other way. Hell, I moved from northern to southern Germany three years ago and people down here hold the door for each other. That seemed a little over the top for me when I moved here. I wasn't used to that much politeness.

In Germany you don't expect strangers to talk to you (which doesn't mean you're not allowed to - but small talk between strangers is rather unusual). So if someone next to you is clearing his throat, you'd just assume that he's simply clearing his throat. ""Excuse me"", on the other hand, is usually used as an opening for a request, not as a request in itself.

The thing is that Germans are speaking more directly, not as toned-down and implicating as Britons/Americans. So if you don't get a reaction from clearing your throat, then it's probably because the other person isn't used to that form of communication. I think it would even be considered rude. It's polite to ask someone nicely to do something.

The public transport is good, I suppose. There are lots of train connections between cities, especially in densely populated areas. Many people use trains to commute, so they may be crowded at certain times of day though. They're usually clean and on time (but you'll hear Germans complain about everything).  
There are buses in every town and subways in most of the bigger cities. You don't need a car to get about in Germany.

Also, this one time I was walking my dog, the dog pooped in front of an apartment building. This woman was knocking on the window. I looked at her a little confused and proceeded to pick up the dog poo with my plastic bag. I do so, I look up, and that woman came out and said ""Ah ok, you got it.""

Another time...I let my 70 year old neighbour take my little dog for a walk. The next day I go with my dog and this old lady approaches me and says ""You don't pick up your dog's poo.""

I replied ""Yes, I do. I always do!""

She said ""No! I saw you from my window yesterday. Your dog pooped and you didn't pick it up.""

So I had to explain to her that I let my old neighbour take my dog for a walk, so it could have been him or someone else with a dog that looks like mine that didn't pick it up.

**But it's no longer the Cold War and American strategy is no longer Europe-based, we're ""Pivoting towards the Pacific/Asia"". France and the United Kingdom are making massive military cuts.** 

**Europe needs to put up or shut-up.**

And we didn't abandon the Fulda Gap for half-a-century because we ran away from responsibility. 

We didn't get involved in the Balkans after the Srebrinca Massacre because we ran away from responsibility. 

And we didn't provide huge logistical, intelligence, command and eventually combat support in Libya, which started out as a supposedly purely European operation, because we ran away from responsibility.  

And we didn't provide logistical and intelligence support, as well as special forces on the ground in neighboring countries, when France invaded Mali because we ran away from responsibility. 

The fact of the matter is, for the past half-a-century, Europe has piggy-backed off the United States, the United Kingdom &amp; France for the majority of it's security and military power projection needs. They are all some of the few, the very few, that actually put forward the 2.5% GDP expenditure on military forces that NATO requires. 

To put it plainly America, France &amp; the United Kingdom have covered Europe in a security blanket which has allowed most European countries to completely neglect their militaries and spend their money elsewhere, because they have somebody else picking up the check. 

But that's not gonna work anymore. America is *""Pivoting towards the Pacific/Asia""* and France &amp; the United Kingdom are making massive military cuts as we speak.

i guess all i can think of right now are first world problems, like not being able to access online stores from the US or UK and so having to wait for TV series or Movies until they're dubbed into german to get them on itunes.

then there is no netflix etc. so all in all it's really hard to legally get even mainstream shows and movies in the original language without buying dvds or wait for it to show up half a year later when they're translated (but that has already gotten better now, esp with cinema blockbusters, they usually arent lagging so much behind anymore, but the 3rd season of game of thrones only appeared on itunes like 4 weeks or so ago)

Yeah, sure, that makes sense, if you completely ignore reality and replace it with your own version. 

Let's not forget that Libya was called for by European countries. Italy included. And it wasn't supposed to be a American-led operation until a good ways into it the logistical network and overall coordination by the participant countries *(which, once again mind you, were European)* was proven inadequate and deficient *(if I recall, some militaries were reduced to dropping concrete training bombs)*. 

And then, you know, we can totally forget that France was the country which unilaterally invaded Mali to stop it from being taken over by Islamic Extremists who could use it as a spring-board for attacks on Europe *(also, funny enough, Niger, Mali's neighbor, produces 25% of France's uranium)*. My country also assisted logistically with this as well as extensive intelligence support *(though to a lesser degree than Libya)*, and we also put down special forces in neighboring countries to assist. 

And the fact that you want to stably integrate Eastern Europe and shield it from Russian influence only backs this argument up that much more. Instead of relying on a mainly U.S.-backed security blanket through NATO, you'd be relying on a mainly E.U.-backed security blanket, which gives you a stronger diplomatic position at the negotiation table.

My country also assisted logistically with this as well as extensive intelligence support (though to a lesser degree than Libya), and we also put down special forces in neighboring countries to assist.

Also you can get a driver liscense for way more less than 2000 Euros, just don't suck to much when driving. Also denying the holocaust is illegal. 

Taxes are higher, but don't reach Swedish levels. The biggest part of your taxes will be social insurance. Health care and all that jazz.

Also I don't think people are not friendly/open to strangers  really cuts it. Many people are reserved but also many people are very open and I met a lot of strangers who became friends.

&gt; I'm not sure how health insurance etc. works for non-citizens, you might want to check that out.

Just like for any citizen ;) You work, you pay taxes and a set amount of your money goes into social insurances that will step in if you need to see a doctor or get unemployed. For students doing a semester over here, many university pay for your health insurance (costs about 150 Euros I think [I'm to lazy to check right now]). If it doesn't, you really should consider paying for it just in case.

Actually the army of laywers got nerved. Before certain laws really helped to rain down shit on you. But now they cap how much money you have to pay rather than the thousands of Euros like before.

And Germany isn't a place overflowing with lawyers. The US wins without much effort.

What deregulation/""free market"" advocates often miss is that having to watch for being scammed is expensive. If I cannot enter a contract without having it checked by a lawyer, because it could include fine print that says that I owe a kidney each time I miss a payment, this imposes a massive cost on anyone entering contracts. For example, the ""Buttonlösung"" (requiring clear wording like ""Buy now"" on buttons used to enter contracts online) used to curb online scams did impose buerocratic costs on businesses, but did relieve people of a lot of fear, uncertainity and requirement for checking details. Same goes for the AGB limitations (the ban to hide surprising conditions in the fine print).

I agree that the tenant protection laws are sometimes a bit over the top. It's not a bad idea per se that the landlord needs a court order to kick you to the curb if you don't pay the rent, but the courts would need to work a lot faster than they do.

You are conflating consumer protection laws with tenant and anti-business laws e.g. preventing landlords from terminating non-paying tenants as long as they are in arrears with just under two months' rent plus utilities.

The fact that tenants may not pay rent for two months and the landlord then has to get a court order to kick the tenant out, incurring potentially thousands of euros in legal costs while the tenant trashes the apartment, burns through utilities (at the landlord's expense) is absurd. The landlord will never, ever recuperate any of his damages because German enforcement law has a high threshold for seizing poor people's incomes.

I don't want poor people to be destroyed by enforcement either, but there is no provision to compensate landlords. If the general public wishes such tenant protections, perhaps the government should be liable to landlords for the cost of the judicial proceedings necessary to get rid of problem tenants.

Again, the landlord can spend thousands of euros getting the non-paying tenant out. Add that to the cost of the apartment which is not bringing in money. Meanwhile, the expenses for the building continue to mount (utilities, property tax, etc) all of which the tenant continues to enjoy during this time at the expense of the landlord.

By all means, create onerous restrictions on large businesses, I'm sure they can afford to hire legal departments, and they also have the market power to pass on those costs to you, the customer.

But small businesses get totally stomped over here, all the way from having to pay a minimum of EUR 450 per month for health care if you are self-employed to the regulatory compliance necessary.

If you're an employee and earn even EUR 850 a month, your health care is free!

America doesn't care *how* you do things. 

America cares that you *can* do things. 

Libya has shown that Europe, as a whole, is incapable of regional power projection and when it needs to be brought to task, it has to rely on America for several critical elements of support. 

Mali also shows this, but too a hugely lesser extent, but regardless, American logistical and intelligence support *was still needed*, even if not to the degree in Libya. And European countries were incapable, or unwilling, to step in to help France in these aspects. 

&gt;We'll create whatever arrangement we believe is right for us, with many thanks to America for its suggestions.

And the arrangement you have now is inefficient and incapable. 

America isn't making a suggestion as much as it is a observation.

&gt;Exactly. The scary Soviet monster has crumbled and it was not because of military pressure. In less than twenty years its Western provinces have joined us and many more are clamoring to do the same, all of that without firing a single shot. We have managed our foreign affairs so that no widespread militant movement has arisen that sees us as Satan-come-onto-Earth, except when we associate with the US.

A argument could be made that the Soviet Union collapsed because of trying to compete in a arms race with America, but that is a different conversation for a different time. 

What European Union foreign policy has shown is that whenever they need to do something that requires hard power instead of soft power, they have to constantly rely on, as I've mentioned many of times before, the United Kingdom, France &amp; America. America, mind you, is a foreign country. Now keep in mind only the smallest handful of countries *(I believe it's only the above three &amp; Greece)* actually maintain the 2.5% GDP to Military Spending ratio required by NATO. If Europe can't even maintain NATO spending levels, what does that tell about their overall ability to properly form a E.U. military, or some kind of cohesive force, in the future? 

&gt;Yeah, I think we are doing quite nicely.

You're doing things with one hand behind your back and you're being constantly reliant on the U.K., U.S. &amp; France. And with big military cuts by France and the United Kingdom, your reliance on America is just that much more. 

Also, as for Eastern Europe, many flocked to the E.U., but do you think they would've been so keen to do that, especially with Russia hot their tail trying to drag them back into their sphere of influence, if it wasn't for a U.S.-backed NATO and Security guarantee?

So ""it's no longer the Cold War"" is a good time scale to call out Europe on its supposed deficiencies in regional interventions, but for judging who's responsible for the situation in the Middle East suddenly the correct time scale is 60 years ago? how convenient :)

The fact of the matter remains that most of the current problematic situations in the Middle East were direct results of US involvement.

The US toppled a popular Iranian government directly resulting in the Islamist revoution and present theocracy.

true,WhiteGradSchoolMale,ITAL,Italy,"&gt; Libya has shown that Europe, as a whole, is incapable of regional power projection and when it needs to be brought to task, it has to rely on America for several critical elements of support. 

You know, considering the media narrative I had taken you at your word, but I don't find much evidence that US help was needed or called in. Looking at the [timeline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya#Proposal_for_the_no-fly_zone), it seems the US was going to intervene whether we did or not for its own reasons. Looking at the [expenses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya#Costs), just the top three EU contributors easily outspent the US, even if we take the highest estimate for US expenditures and the lowest for UK expenditures. So no, I'm not convinced that Libya proves much of anything.

&gt; Mali also shows this, but too a hugely lesser extent, but regardless, American logistical and intelligence support was still needed, even if not to the degree in Libya.

Again, I find no evidence that it was needed. It helped, it was a good thing, but did France lack the capability to act on its own? I don't know that.

&gt; And the arrangement you have now is inefficient and incapable. 

Judging by results, it's actually working out quite nicely. The places we have most invested in seem really willing to align with us.

&gt; What European Union foreign policy has shown is that whenever they need to do something that requires hard power instead of soft power, they have to constantly rely on, as I've mentioned many of times before, the United Kingdom, France &amp; America.

&gt; [...]

&gt; You're doing things with one hand behind your back and you're being constantly reliant on the U.K., U.S. &amp; France.

I don't get why you constantly separate Europe on one side and the UK and France on the other. The UK and France are part of Europe, actually two rather important parts. The other major countries by GDP and population, Germany and Italy, have WWII-era limitations on the size and capabilities of their militaries.

&gt; Also, as for Eastern Europe, many flocked to the E.U., but do you think they would've been so keen to do that, especially with Russia hot their tail trying to drag them back into their sphere of influence, if it wasn't for a U.S.-backed NATO and Security guarantee?

Russia did try its hardest to not let them go West and of course NATO (which, by the way, is a *joint* US-Western Europe endeavor) protection was part of the attraction, but let's not pretend like it was the US' work that lead them towards the EU.

And let's forget that the U.S.-backed Coup De'tat wasn't at the behest of the British and the interests of British Petroleum. 

And let's not forget, if you want to talk about time frames, that de-colonization didn't come into full effect until the 1950s and the 1960s, at the same time of the Iranian coup de'tat you mentioned. And this de-colonization, mind you, was dealt it's coffin nail at the Suez Canal, after a allied British/French/Israeli force invaded Egypt and seized it.

Or, in reference to your own country, how far Italian corporations have gone in exploiting a country like Somalia, dumping toxic waste in it's oceans and such. 

And I still hold up that most of the funding in Afghanistan went to the Northern Alliance, who's leader fought a civil war against the Taliban and was assassinated *(surprise!)* on September 11, 2001.

Sometimes it is stuffed with cheese and some other kind of meat. While it's delicious, I generally suffer from a kind of malaise for a day or two after eating it. However, many schnitzel dishes aren't breaded in Germany. The Jaegerschnitzel recipe I have, the meat is coated with a bit of flour and then pan fried, and served over a bed of roasted vegetables with a light brown sauce. There isn't a potato to be seen. It's a completely different animal that's positively healthful compared to what you get in a restaurant.

In general, there are a ton of delicious veggie dishes that never make it into American German-style restaurants which is a real shame. Germans are awesome at vegetables but we rarely get to eat them.

Than you'd be wrong, dead wrong. There's not way in hell that Europe could've done Libya without America. My point stands. 

[NATO Commander: EU could not do Libya without US](http://euobserver.com/defence/115650)

&gt;NATO Major-General Marcel Druart, addressing the European Parliament committee on security and defence on Tuesday (20 March), said NATO relied heavily on US military expertise on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

[NATO states continue to squabble on Libya command]
&gt;So no, I'm not convinced that Libya proves much of anything.

Than you'd be as wrong as the sun is bright. There is no way in hell NATO could've done Libya by itself. 

[NATO states continue to squabble on Libya command](http://euobserver.com/defence/32050)  

&gt;The US is keen to hand over the hot potato of Operation Odyssey Dawn command to Nato as soon as possible. Italy has also urged NATO to take the lead.

[Libya, Europe and the future of NATO: Always waiting for the U.S. Cavalry](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-future-nato)

&gt;America was visibly reluctant to get involved, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies. 

&gt;Again, I find no evidence that it was needed. It helped, it was a good thing, but did France lack the capability to act on its own? I don't know that.

France could've done Mali itself, it would've just taken longer and been harder. It was fully in France's capability. America just helped make it a little easier. But the fact is that France had to turn to America, a foreign country, and could not rely on Europe. Hell, the European Union only showed *token* support for the operation outside of the United Kingdom. 

&gt;I don't get why you constantly separate Europe on one side and the UK and France on the other. The UK and France are part of Europe, actually two rather important parts. The other major countries by GDP and population, Germany and Italy, have WWII-era limitations on the size and capabilities of their militaries.

I'm not separating them, I'm merely pointing out that their the only European countries capable of actual power projection. Along with the United States, they ARE a special group, the group most tasked with Europe's military responsibility. 

And you're forgetting Spain. Also, Germany has shown itself quite well in Afghanistan and both America and many other countries were calling for it's military intervention in Libya, instead it chose to increase operations in Afghanistan so other countries would be less burdened there to help with Libya. They have the means, they have the leeway, they merely lack the will. As for Italy, I don't know about Italy, they have two aircraft carriers and nobody batted a eyelash when they participated in Libya or Afghanistan. So, you know, what you're saying, I don't know that. So no, I'm not convinced that what you say about those two countries proves much of anything.

&gt;Russia did try its hardest to not let them go West and of course NATO (which, by the way, is a joint US-Western Europe endeavor) protection was part of the attraction, but let's not pretend like it was the US' work that lead them towards the EU.

Too bad that especially the ARD is a giant clusterfuck of scared, old people caring only about their particular interests. Everything is watered down to hell, discussed forever to death and has to follow strict proportional representation, leading to a giant waste of money and tactical, bland decision making.
Also the influence of political parties and certain interest groups on the 2 public broadcasters is WAY too high. 
Instead of delivering broadcasting for the people this created a cancerous system that sucks money out of everyone with the main goal of keeping itself alive and those in the system well nourished.  

The GEMA was meant to protect the interests of the artists and ensure fair share of revenue was paid to everyone. Too bad it also went completely overboard and created a giant bureaucratic behemoth that no one can escape anymore, justified or not. It's a system that was meant to create more fairness and equality, instead it now hinders progress and artistic freedom.

Both the GEMA and the GEZ are very good examples of things that are wrong in this country - you take a good idea and then fuck it up royally by applying German overcomplicated Gründlichkeit and the love for keeping the status quo at all costs instead of going with the times.

There's as much or more diversity between where I currently live (in the norhternmost part of Kentucky) and rural areas less than 100 miles away in the same state as there was between where I lived for five years in Baden-Württemberg and, say, Berlin. It's hard to generalize when it comes to US states because they're so different; Ohio is much larger than Kentucky, but for the most part is much more culturally similar across the board than Kentucky and is certainly more culturally homogeneous than Germany. 

Edit: It's also hard to compare based on ""size"" because even the largest US state by population (California, around 30 million IIRC) is much smaller than Germany by population (around 80 million IIRC). The closest in physical size (Montana and New Mexico) are both very sparsely populated, so it's not really fair to make a comparison. For the same reason, you can't really compare each country to the other. I will say however, that you will NOTICE much less cultural diversity in many parts of Germany.
