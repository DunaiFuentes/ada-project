Here's a list of things to do/see while you're in Madrid. Some are known, others are a little off the beaten path. 

-If you're looking to check out some Flamenco while you're here, a place called Cafetin La Quimera has a great/cheap show. It's near the main bullring (Metro stop: Las Ventas) and you can buy the tickets here http://www.atrapalo.com/entradas/cafetin-la-quimera_l15609. It's 8.5e and it includes a drink-most places are 25+ (recently upped the price but still reasonable). 
-If you want to see some Museums, the Prado and the Reina Sofia are musts, in that order. Both are free after a certain time, check their websites for more info. 
-For tapas go to Calle Cave Baja in the La Latina neighborhood or the Mercado San Miguel near Plaza Mayor (touristy and a little overpriced but very nice). The Malasaña barrio (north of Gran Via) has a lot of great bars and some big discos as well. Huertas is a little touristy but Plaza Santa Ana has some good bars in it. 
-Definitely go get churros at Chocolateria San Gines (which is conveniently located right behind Joy Eslava) near Calle Arenal. It's open all night and is great at any hour. 
-A great spot to get over your hangover is Cafe La Mallorquina right on the SW corner of la Puerta de Sol on Calle Mayor.  
-A restaurant for the best sandwich in the world is Bar Melo's and it's on C/ Ave María, 44, 28012 Madrid, Spain +34 915 27 50 54. Make sure you order the ""Zapatilla"" and at least a few croquetas. The pimientos depadrónn are also super yummy. 
-The chapel San Antonio de la Florida is one of my favorite spots in Madrid. The roof of the chapel is completely painted by Goya and it's a great free way to spend an hour. Right next door is a good Asturian place to get lunch called Casa Mingo. 
-In Plaza Callao right next to Gran Via you'll see a big department store called Corte Inglés. Take the elevator to the top floor which they call the Gourmet Experience. Walk down the hall and go outside for amazing views of the city. 
-Some of the big clubs in the city are Kapital, Joy Eslava, and Tartufo. 
-Some other must-sees are Retiro, Cibeles, the Palace, Cathedral (check out the prayer room), Sol, Opera, Calle Arenal. 
-If you have time for a day trip, Toledo is the best bet out of the many options. Really worth the effort. frequent buses and trains go there.",0,1386663719,null,0,false,0,cdy57ii,t3_1shnds,t1_cdy57ii,t3_1shnds,null,1428301916,3,false,Madrid,t5_2si9y,3

You aren't doing it. That was done by the Spanish government with a weird system of tax credits and discounts.

&gt; It needs to be cut more.

&gt; You have been told since the 90's to cut down your fleet, and there was plenty of alternatives then. 

Spain has been reducing the size of the fleet since the 90s, a 45%. Did you read my comment?

&gt; You are not concerned about the environment, working industry, cutting down on subsidies etc? I guess not, you only want money from us

And here we are with the personal attacks. 


&gt; In fact, Spain has been on the receiving end of EU money since 1986. 27 years! Empires have been built and lost in shorter time than that. When will it stop? Are my grandchildren going to pay for people in Spain?

Spain isn't getting cohesion funds anymore, only structural funds. Spain is going to be a net retriever for like 50 euros per capita. And in the US the South has been a net retriever since the end of the Civil war.

&gt; I don't want to be in the EU because it is apparent to me that the south do not want change, and they vastly outnumber us. It is evident with the CAP- had the south wanted change they would have reformed, and voted for it. They haven't, ever.

About the US- you might have missed the fact that they are one country. We are not. Why should I pay for a country that voted against reforms, ruins the environment on purpose and clearly do not want to improve. If you want to improve why then constantly vote against reforms. 

And, same to you. You are so fucking Spanish oriented and clearly, with your example about the US want us to pay for you for the next 150 years.

Et puis, le droit d'auteur est seulement important, dans ce contexte, pour les logiciels: Seule l'expression d'une idée, et non pas l'idée elle-même, est protégée par le droit d'auteur. En conséquence, on ne peut pas protéger une découverte scientifique, ou un procédé innovant, par le droit d'auteur. Ainsi, le droit d'auteur peut protéger les plans, c'est-à-dire les dessins, d'une invention, mais non pas le principe de l'invention qui, faute de protection par brevet, par exemple, pourrait être reproduite en toute légalité. Le droit d'auteur peut aussi protéger un article scientifique, mais non pas les idées transmises dans cet article. Et même dans le domaine des logiciels, le droit d'auteur protège uniquement le code, et non pas les algorithmes sous-jacents. Au fond, c'est même une aberration légale que l'on protège les logiciels par le droit d'auteur, qui était initialement destiné à protéger les œuvres ""littéraires ou artistiques"", plutôt qu'utilitaires. La très controversée protection des logiciels par le brevet d'invention semble finalement mieux adaptée, mais bon, le législateur en a décidé autrement...

It seems a difficult protest to get behind because it has, like Occupy Wall before it, become diluted by multiple parties jumping in. It has origins in the left and the right and is now appearing to present itself as neither.

It's still early hours yet but the protest in Arezzo is still tranquil. 20-30 people and growing. We're far from any prospect of violence.

People inside have told me that it's other people joining and causing trouble, but they were proud that the police said to them yesterday that they stand in solidarity.

ALL of their representatives have been crooks. Really really bad people so to say.
Their biggest failure was Franz Joseph Strauss and the so called ""Amigo Affair"" which terribly ignored all rules of a democracy.

I have doubts Bavaria is part of the democratic world. They are kinda like the guys terrorising Thailand at the moment to end democracy there. If you'd ask some people in rural bavaria if they think a democracy is good I promise the vast majority will say they could live without it as long as the CSU is in charge.

La clé pour elles vient avant tout de la définition d'indicateurs de performance adaptés. Par exemple, on a calculé que les femmes étaient plus régulières et codaient en moyenne avec moins de bugs que les hommes. 

Par contre, sans vouloir faire de clichés car on a regardé ça sérieusement avec des données objectives, la résolution de bugs urgents ou prioritaires est en moyenne faite plus rapidement par des hommes. Ainsi, on a quand même tendance à donner les projets avec des délais serrés à des hommes, qui ont tendance effectivement à rester plus longtemps au boulot dans les périodes de rush, mais le reste du temps (dans les périodes creuses) codent avec plus de bugs.

C'était d'ailleurs similaire quand je bossais dans l'industrie : on mettait plus de femmes dans les opérations régulières, mais dans les opérations ponctuelles (réception, chargement / déchargement, heures sup' et commandes urgentes), c'était majoritairement des hommes.

Il faut bien se rendre compte que l'argent n'a pas de sexe. Ce qui compte pour un employeur dans une grande boite, c'est la performance. Il n'y a pas de complot contre les femmes.

Aujourd'hui, dans mon entreprise, la personne la plus demandée pour nos gros projets est une femme (au passage, elle a été naturalisée Française il y a quelques semaines et tout le monde, moi compris, est ravi).

And it's your effort not the EU's and that's why it's image problem will persist.

The problem here as well is that I don't care for satellite technology that much. I have an interest in general copyright law from a user perspective. I'd be happy to be a user of space faring technology but I don't it will happen.

Anyway here goes:

* It would be nice if I could learn about how the specific technology works without having to buy the IP. Be it on the internet or in books or reports on them. Preferably the internet though.

* Personally I think the 60,75 or 100 years until the copyright/patent runs out unreasonably long. In my opinion 10 to 20 years would be sufficient.

I support the idea that somebody who comes up with a novel idea should be rewarded for that with an temporary economical advantage. Why do I have a problem with the term of it? It's working less as an advantage and more as interest on a loan. 99 years after it's inception the idea is hardly novel and relevant to the cutting edge. People either moved and built on it or have developed alternative paths. A time longer than 20 years ensures a steady income of usage fees for the owner. That's not the economical advantage I would like. The advantage of having a technology first in this day and age is often advantage enough. If you extend that peroid to 20 years that can be a hard stop to competition. A lifetime is just profiteering.

* IP should not be owned by companies.

People come up with the ideas, people should be rewarded for it. 

If the number of people is small they can make a contract on how to distribute the money, if the number of people gets too big and the IP doesn't produce enough revenue to pay somebody to manage it, it's probably not worth it anyway. 

If they fail to make a contract and put the IP's management in order, the IP should go into the public domain. I'd be very happy when I buy a product I like and I know I'm supporting it's inventor(s). I don't see why corporate image number 25 needs that extra revenue while the people that came up with it don't get a proper cut. 

Maybe this should include the option that the people can give up their share individually. This should not be includable in employment contracts. Or differently, I just thought of programming where developing IP is the product if you will, the company should get an exclusive non-transferable use right on the IP developed by it's employees. It doesn't own it but I can use it freely. The use-right goes invalid on sale or bankruptcy of the company. Or can be given again by all people who made the IP. I.E. the inventors can sell the use right again but only on the term of what ever remains of the 20 years.

That's what I can come up with right now.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Je peux témoigner sur la différence de salaire. J'ai occupé un poste il y a quelques années. Je faisais exactement le même boulot qu'un collègue masculin. Il avait le même nombre d'années d'expérience que moi, était moins diplômé que moi. Au niveau compétences, je pense avoir été meilleure que lui. (C'est mon opinion bien sur :) mais j'ai été promue deux fois depuis, pas lui.) Il gagnait plus de 30% de plus que moi.

Un jour, j'ai pris mon courage à deux mains et j'ai vu le responsable RH. J'ai demandé très calmement qu'il m'explique pourquoi (si ce n'est la paire de c*** qui me fait défaut). La réponse ne s'est pas fait attendre, il lui a changé carrément de département. Ne faisant plus le même taf, je ne pouvais plus comparer le salaire ...

Je travaille dans un milieu plutôt geek. Moins de 17% de femmes en général et moins de 10% d'ingénieurs femmes. Je ne ressens pas de sexisme flagrant particulier. Quand je suis contrariée par un dysfonctionnement pourtant flagrant, on m'a déjà rétorqué ""t'as tes règles?"", ce qui est insupportable! 

En règle général, dans ce milieu, il faut être presque irréprochable. J'ai l'impression qu'on est plus exigeant à promouvoir des femmes que des gars. Mais si on assure vraiment, le sexe ne fait quasiment plus de différence. 

Dans ce milieu, il faut adapter sa tenue aussi. Je ne mets plus de jupes courtes, ou des décolletés sympa. Je perds mon audience très facilement sinon, et il y a des regards insistants. Ça ne me gène pas d'adapter ma tenue, j'aurai fait pareil à leur place. C'est rigolo et presque attendrissant de les voir quand une nouvelle stagiaire ou recrue arrive.

Il n'y a pas que des inconvénients aussi, j'ai conscience que le fait d'être une femme m'a aidé dans plein de cas. Là ou mes collègues masculin se cassent les dents face à un interlocuteur difficile (mauvaise foi, communication inexistante, agressivité,..) j'arrive a faire avancer le shmilblique pour tout le monde.

That's correct, but then what it seems like you're asking is that Sweden be allowed to tell them how they should do things, without them having a vote, because Sweden puts some money into the pot. 

Those countries also put money into the pot. Yes, they get more out than they put in, but some of the money they get is nevertheless their own money. So no single country, even if it is a net payer, should get to say what happens.

You can make that an argument for Sweden to withdraw from the EU, and concentrate its money on its own farming - but that argument falls down immediately from the moral high ground, because that way Sweden achieves absolutely nothing at all in terms of improving the environmental situation in other EU countries.

On est en désaccord là-dessus. Le**S** mouvement**S** féministe**S** s'attachent à prouver leurs théories principalement par des exemples ad-hoc et des inversions de flux ou renversement cause conséquence.

&gt;C'est d'ailleurs un homme de paille très aisé à convoquer pour ne surtout pas s'attaquer aux vrais problèmes.

Les vrais problèmes, j'en parle [ici](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1sebv2/le_gouvernement_va_soccuper_des_jeuxvideo_et/cdxbq0h), personne n'a jamais mis en cause ce que je disais. Il n'y a pas de patriarcat. Il y a des conséquences mesurables de différences principalement biologiques. Qui sont mal interprétées par les mouvements féministes pour en faire des preuves d'une domination masculine alors qu'il s'agit de principes de sélection naturelle.

&gt;les structures en place dans notre société font que c'est par exemple souvent les femmes qui prennent des jours off pour s'occuper des gamins malades

Source ?

Les structures biologiques font que ce sont les femmes qui sont enceintes, qui accouchent et qui vont donc être plus arrêtées que les hommes.

Je ne connais pas d'étude qui montre que dans le cas où un couple a le même salaire, [bénéficie de congés ""enfant malade""](http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/informations-pratiques,89/fiches-pratiques,91/conges-et-absences-du-salarie,114/les-conges-pour-enfant-malade,12785.html), et s'occupe indifféremment de l'enfant, c'est la femme qui aura plus tendance à prendre des congés.

&gt;Partant de là, il est plutôt anormal de les sanctionner salarialement

Belle inversion de flux. Il n'y a pas de sanction. Tu es payé quand tu viens, quel que soit ton sexe. Ce n'est pas à l'employeur à décider si c'est au parent 1 ou au parent 2 de s'occuper de l'enfant. L'employeur paie celui qui vient et qui travaille. Bref, c'est un faux problème.

Un vrai problème, c'est par contre que les femmes ne créent pas assez d'entreprises. Par exemple, [dans les grandes écoles](http://www.cge.asso.fr/document/1273/enquete-insertionj-2013.pdf), **il y a deux fois moins de femmes qui créent des entreprises** dans les écoles de management, et **5 fois moins dans les écoles d'ingénieur**.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;ut that argument falls down immediately from the moral high ground, because that way Sweden achieves absolutely nothing at all in terms of improving the environmental situation in other EU countries.

No, it improves things for us. As it is now, we have to lower our standards and support things like wine and tobacco, and non environmental stuff. At least our tax money will not pay for that anymore. Besides, why should we pay for Greece for example? They have been in the EU for 32 years, and voted and worked *against* reforms. They clearly do not want change. Why should we pay for people who behaves like that? I mean, if we have to pay for them for the next 32 years as well, we loose money. 

&gt;Currently you pay some money in, and you get some influence - the alternative is to pay none, and have none.

Yes, but at least I wouldn't have to live in constant fear that the EU would take over something more and fuck up it even more than the CAP. The south is clearly not at all interested in improving, just money transfers (were they interested, they would not have fought the CAP reforms for example). They are more populous and will obviously vote for that my tax money will go to them, that is what they have been doing before. 


&gt;That's correct, but then what it seems like you're asking is that Sweden be allowed to tell them how they should do things, without them having a vote, because Sweden puts some money into the pot. 

So, you are admitting that the majority of the EU are people only interested in grabbing money from the north, not improving, not reforming? Why would anyone want to be in a union with people like that?

&gt;Those countries also put money into the pot. Yes, they get more out than they put in, but some of the money they get is nevertheless their own money. So no single country, even if it is a net payer, should get to say what happens.

I am not saying Sweden alone should run the EU, but clearly, some countries work better than others, and we should look at best practise. And, if someone have for example high standards with regards to the environment, they should be premiered for that, not forced to lower the standards - others should raise theirs. 

However, the south have clearly shown that they are in no way interested in improving and reforming. If they were, they would have reformed their agriculture, and not fought reformation of the CAP, for decades. So, they do not want improvement. One can't deal with people like that.  How do one negotiate with people who only want money from you, not improve? Their voting and their behaviour shows that. 

An alternative is removing the CAP and other common policies and become more of a trade union. That way, countries can grow tobacco and wine with pesticides and antibiotics to their hearts content. At least I don't have to pay for it. 

And, we pay more taxes than they do, no matter how one counts. In % and also due to the fact that we are far more likely to pay them. They however,have kept voting for corrupt regimes and lower taxes. So, they get to have low taxes that they don't pay, because we pay for them. How is that fair? 

Furthermore, which you didn't touch or answer, for how long is this financial transfer going to continue? It is clearly not working. Greece has been in the EU since 1981, Spain/Portugal since '86 and they have received billions. But, they are in worse shape than ever. If you have done something for 32 years, and it is obviously not working, then you stop. EU however, has no plans of stopping, none at all.We just keep throwing money into the bottomless pit that is southern Europe. Honestly - we have to stop that. I mean, the EU could keep the money they get from us (I'm not advocating a lower fee,unless we remove the CAP), but do not give anything more to the south. Invest in research, education, environment- whatever, but no more throwing good money after bad. Or perhaps, give money to the south, but then in a completely different way. What we are doing now is not working. 

Not that the EU, and those countries care. Obviously they are going to keep voting for keeping the money flowing, rather than change. All I see is that I am setting up my non existent grandchild for paying off Greece's debt in 60 years. Why should she? Why can't we have a time limit? Why can't those countries improve, and why the fuck should I pay for them, when they constantly refuse to change, pay less taxes, vote for idiots, etc? 

If the EU wanted improvement, they should start dealing with those things, but they do not. They just want money. And, those countries have more people than we do, they are going to keep voting for us to pay their bills. I am not setting up my children to pay off Greece's debt and Spains agriculture in 60 years, no way.  And, since they don't care about improving, we have to leave. It would have been different if they were like Estonia or Poland, working on it, but they are not. They have proved that again and again through not  improving, voting and their behaviour. Yes, it is costly to leave, but it will be more costly to stay and just endlessly transfer money to the south. And, I am sure those transfers will increase.

Official employees and the webpage said it was because of technical difficulties. But when I finally arrived at my families place my father looked pretty down and silently told me he propably knew why my train was late. A former collegue of him had commited suicide by throwing himself in front of a train (at the same time and position my route was delayed).

true,elphieLil84,sardegna,,"Vi racconto perché questo post mi ha interessata fino a postarlo qui per sapere cosa ne pensaste.

Ho un amico che al liceo era una persona abbastanza intelligente. Ha fatto 2 anni in UK, suonava la chitarra, poteva fare un discorso logico,gli piacevano i computer e smanettava discretamente... un tipo sveglio. Ma non leggeva i giornali, né si informava. Aveva altro per la testa. 

Io a 16 anni leggevo, mi informavo, discutevo. Però facevo anche autogestione perché il tetto della scuola ci era caduto in testa, e andavo alle manifestazioni dei cassintegrati sardi per cercare di capire. Lo Stato DEVE garantire lavoro? o forse bisogna prima crearlo?Prima i diritti o l´efficienza? 

A casa parlavo di politica e discutevo coi miei su cosa si sentiva al tg. Non é che facessi poi tanto, ma seguivo. Sono stata cresciuta così,veniva naturale. Di certo non ho speso il mio tempo nelle sedi di un partito, perché non ho mai sentito di poter aderire così tanto a qualcosa. 
Con tutto ciò, il mio amico andava al bar. Letteralmente, a quei tempi prendere il caffé al bar, nella mia scuola un po´snob, era il massimo dell´interazione sociale, fra nuovle di fumo di sigaretta, a organizzare le serate in discoteca.

All´università abbiamo fatto entrambi diritto, lui alla Bocconi, e io a Cagliari. Ancora, lui faceva quel che doveva, con buoni voti,ma preferiva farsi gli affari propri e non si interessava di politica. Nel frattempo noi leggevamo saggi di filosofia politica per capire, e ci aprivamo alla politica e all´economia internazionale. Da sinistrorsi a liberali, e poi di nuovo in mezzo, a ridefinire il rapporto fra cittadino, economia, istituzioni. Ho poi studiato relazioni internazionali e politiche europee, e mi ha aiutato a capire quei meccanismi globali che influenzano la vita di tutti noi. Il mio amico, ancora al bar. Ed é anche diventato avvocato a Milano.

Flash forward all´anno scorso. Finalmente il mio amico si apre alla politica. E, come me a 16 anni, ci si butta con passione. Che ovviamente trova in Beppe Grillo. Mi dice di ""guardare Zeitgeist"", che  grazie a questo lui ha capito un sacco di cose. Ho un bel dire che l´ho già visto, e che non mi ha detto poi granché.

E´lodevolissimo finalmente iniziare a partecipare alla vita pubblica. Il problema é che la maturità politica si acquisisce in anni di partecipazione e si, anche studio. Se non ti leggi la base del pensiero politico del ´900, se non ti leggi un po´di storia, é davvero difficile interpretare certi fenomeni e vederne le sfaccettature. 

E´ovvio che non si nasca con la scienza in mano, e ci vuole tempo a raffinare il proprio pensiero, ad avvicinarci alle opinioni degli altri, capirle e rielaborare le nostre.

Non sarà Zeitgeist a spiegarti il mondo, se conosci tutto quello che ha portato a Zeitgeist e a quella visione del mondo. Sapresti che ci sono correnti di pensiero, tutte anche molto valide, e ben sapresti perché hai scelto la tua. Ma se uno inizia a 29 anni e altri a 16, la profondità della prospettiva sarà necessariamente diversa. Cose di fronte alla quali io mi fermo a riflettere e a vedere in maniera critica, il mio amico abbraccia con entusiasmo. Ma é normale, perché nei miei primi approcci alla politica, anche io facevo così. 

Questa che ho descritto é una persona sola, ma ce ne sono milioni. Non é che la loro prospettiva valga meno della mia, ma per questioni di tempistica e di meno tempo avuto per approfondire, ovviamente può differire in maturità, e l´entusiasmo può portare a peccare di attenzione e criticità. Io non mi sento certo migliore, ma certo, rilevo alcune ingenuità.

Con l´articolo in questione dissento su molte cose, ma il nucleo lo comprendo.

Do you want more? I can do this all day you know. Frankly, criscising Spain's fishing industry is like shooting fish in a barrell if you excuse the pun. The fact that you support everything that is criscised above is beyond me. How can anyone who is not a retard (which you are not) support illegal fishing, destroying other people's livelyhood, fish on other countrie's water, but above all *destroy the livestock, outfish the ocean and make sure there are no more fish in the sea**? That is beyond me that you and your country think you have a right to do that. It is so egoistical, so narcissitic, and so Spanish centric, that it is disgusting. How can anyone defend that? Brw, we are *certainly* not perfect in that regard, but in the last 10 years our government have really, really made an effort, which is noticeable actually. We still have overcapacity though. But, you can bash us too, which we deserve, however, Spain is worse. And, the problem is, you choose to. I mean, all countries that fish have the same problems, but one doesn't have to side with the fishing industry, not at all. 

&gt;Spain is near the average in GDP per capita. http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114

So why are you receiving money then? Shouldn't they go to countries like Bulgaria etc? You are going to receive it for the next 7 years, not be a contributor. 


&gt;You should define reforms. Spain has supported reforms to the migration policies and the EU parliament


CAP, the biggest budget post of them all. Spain is receiving money from that, not paying. It has been needing reformation for decedes. Why fight against it?

&gt;EDIT: Sweden is getting more structural funds than Netherlands with less population and the same GDP per capita, but you know the rules favour rural areas.

Actually, they have changed the rules for that, for Sweden and Finland. If we actually followed the rules, Sweden/Finland should receive far, far more, since we are so sparsly populated. But, they have special rules for us. I don't even know if I want the EU to have funds to develop rural areas, I think they could give those money back to the countries, and let them do it for themselves. 

&gt;And Spain is going from 500 euros to 40 euros per capita.

Dates? Why should you receive money at all?Also, you surpassed the  the threshold, but have still still received money. [Link, page 1](http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/wcm/connect/02b184804f0189e093b3f73170baead1/Chislett011206Newsletter_20.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=02b184804f0189e093b3f73170baead1).Why? So, now you are finally getting less, which you should have had less in 2006. Btw, with that per capita income, you can bloody well pay for your fishermen's unemployment benefits. 


Also, Spain will at least receive money until 2020. That is 34 bloody years! How long should we pay for Spain? Clearly, since the situation is worse than ever in the south, EU's strategy is not working. If one has done something for 32 years (which is the case with Greece, 27 for Spain and Portugal) and it is not working, then one should stop. If it worked, they would not be on the receiving end any more. 

So, I don't even care if the EU spends the money on research etc (keep them), but do not give any more money south until we figuer out why it isn't working. 

&gt;The transfers aren't permanent a country can fall. And Spain is going from 500 euros to 40 euros per capita.

For some they are. Greece is hardly on the way to becoming a net contributor, are they? How many decades shall we pay for them? 

&gt;Yeah, Spain isn't doing reforms: but the number of people working in the primary sector is the 20% of the ones that we have when we joined the EU. ? 


So? How does that change? Everyone's markets have changed since 1986. 


&gt;The energy sector has been privatized, the labour market has been liberalized, collective agreements scrapped, pension system changed, public financial sector privatized..

We too! Germany too (and a reunion upon that)! Finland too! How is that an argument?

As for learning Norwegian... I'm not sure. If I where to permanently move to Norway I would try to learn the language ofc, but then again I'm a college educated young guy that's lived in three countries and speaks 2 foreign languages, so yeah... I guess it would be ridiculously hypocritical of me to point my finger at some middle-aged woman who was raised in some village in Pakistan, forbidden to go to school after the age of 12, that probably just spends her whole life just doing house chores and takes care of her kids, and berate her for not being able to pass a test in a language that is as different as possible from Urdu or Punjabi.

[How the olive oil industry fought reforms](http://www.oliveoiltimes.com/olive-oil-business/olive-oil-industry-reject-cap-reform/21199). 

An article on the bitter fighting in 1999. The south sided with France, they always do. [Link](http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1999/03/cap-m05.html).

[Here is a paper that mentions that the CAP needs to be reformed and is the source of bitter conflicts- from 1989....](http://www.guillermodeladehesa.com/files/0006.1268929784.XCFH5413JNUT1514LSYC5388VOMO4943.pdf). 

[Just one example of the bitter fights around the CAP, the sugar fight of 2013](http://www.euractiv.com/cap/sugar-quota-speaks-bitter-debate-news-518179). 

About the fighting in 2002..[Link](http://www.economist.com/node/1213328). 

Also, the south always side with France, always. 

&gt;Perhaps also about the proposed reforms that the south allegedly votes down permanently?

They haven't done it permanently, finally, in particular this time, we got *some* of it through, but it was against the wishes of the south who fought us every single step of the way. As I have shown you, this have been going on practically since the EU was founded and the south is not letting go. They are going to get our mony! Now, CAP is by far the biggest post in the budget (44 % at the moment) it is discriminating, far to big, not environmental friendly enough, adjusted to the south etc. I don't even understand why I should pay for Spain's agriculture, in particular if they don't even want to reform. 

So, for decades we are in a union with countries that outnumber us, and refuse, in every way, to reform. Who want to be in a union like that? 

Was this what you were searching for? 

A question I have, and perhaps you can answer - Greece has been in the EU since 1981, Spain and Portugal since 1986. For how long are we going to give them money? Clearly it is not working, since they have received billions and are in worse shape than ever. By the looks of it, it seems my non existing grandchild will pay off Greece's debt. How can the EU still support that? If you have done something for 32 years, and it is worse than when you started, why not stop? Shouldn't there be a time limit for how long we have to support someone?

A differenza di chi ha scritto il post, che sembrava sottolineare come SEMPRE lui facesse la cosa giusta, in tutti gli stadi della sua crescita politica, io credo che il punto sia proprio la crescita.

Devi poter dire le tue cazzate e devi poterti entusiasmare per gli idioti quando inizi ad occuparti di politica. Non si nasce con la verità in tasca, e la verità, con buona pace di Platone, manco esiste.

Se mi permetti di parafrasarti, penso che ti preoccupi l´incomunicabilità fra questi due gruppi, gli snob e gli ""italiani medi. In realtà io credo che essi possano comunicare nel momento in cui l´italiano medio mette giù il forcone e lo snob smette di scandalizzarsi davanti ad espedienti di comunicazione ""bassa"" e davanti alla semplificazione.

The monarch is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England; the head of the church is, of course, Jesus Christ.

Elections in Britain are held at least once a year, usually more often, accounting for local elections, EU elections, by-elections, devolved elections. General Elections for the Westminster Parliament are held at least every 5 years.

The word ""Britain"" generally doesn't refer to Northern Ireland, while British Isles can also refer to the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and Ireland (the country). The 4 countries given are the elements of the United Kingdom.

There is certainly place in the UK for intolerance and extremism - one only has to look at the current Cabinet.

So not only are the questions useless (other than in generating revenue for whoever publishes the official book with the answers), they are at least partly wrong.

*Edit*: Oooh, there are more questions on other pages. I failed the second page. This has some useful things like the time pubs generally open, but some more wrong answers:

~~The Queen's oldest son is the current heir to the throne, but as of 2013, it is gender-neutral, so her eldest child is her heir.~~^1

The House of Commons cannot always overrule the House of Lords - there is an exception for Bills extending the life of a Parliament beyond 5 years.

The UK Government, public bodies and courts do not have to follow the principles of the European Convention, and must go against them if the law (or in the cases of courts, a senior court) says so; see among others, Prisoner Voting.

So many errors; juries can have under 12 members, King Harold and King Alfred both defeated Vikings.... I could spend all day on this, it's fun.

The Greenpeace article is interesting talks about something that is known we are promoting capital intensive high technology big ships and the scrapping of the more traditional fishing practices. It's one of the reasons why the job destruction and the reduction of the number of ships(around 45% both) has been way higher than the reduction in the capacity of the fleet. And they advice to do the opposite. What do you think?

&gt; The fact that you support everything that is criscised above is beyond me. 

I don't support everything, but I support some things. Half of the traditional fleet is gone, it has been harsh the economy of those areas. I support that Spain fishes in other countries territorial waters if has the support of the local government. There are some grey situations like the fishing in the Western Sahara with Morocco license, but that's how the world works. I didn't support illegal fishing. I said that you can't expect a quicker reduction of the traditional fleet.

&gt; And, the problem is, you choose to. I mean, all countries that fish have the same problems, but one doesn't have to side with the fishing industry, not at all. 



&gt; Dates? Why should you receive money at all?

For the same reason as UK, France and Germany. Because there are rules and we fulfill the requirements.

&gt; Also, you surpassed the the threshold, but have still still received money. Link, page 1.Why?

The concept of transition funds was created to reduce the influx of funds. Cyprus in the same program now, they are over the threshold and are going to get transition funds until 2020.

&gt;  So, now you are finally getting less, which you should have had less in 2006. Btw, with that per capita income, you can bloody well pay for your fishermen's unemployment benefits. 

We are using 4% of our GDP in paying unemployment benefits already. And 40% of the jobless don't get benefits. ([Spanish, sorry](http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2013/12/03/529d8d6b0ab740d2318b4571.html)).


&gt; Also, Spain will at least receive money until 2020. That is 34 bloody years! How long should we pay for Spain?

Not everybody can be a net contributor for obvious reasons. I wouldn't expect the Spanish economy to get better in the future. Most of the long term problems haven't fixed. However, at this point Spain isn't the biggest burden in the budget.  And actually I would be more concerned about the fact that Italy is moving from contributor to retriever.

&gt; Greece is hardly on the way to becoming a net contributor, are they? How many decades shall we pay for them? 

Greece is probably going to get more funds in this budget than in the previous one. That's logical with the sharp fall in GDP. The EU seems to think that everything is going OK with Greece.

&gt;  How is that an argument?

You seemed to think that Spain is rejecting any *reform.*

&gt; CAP, the single biggest post in the EU budget. You have fought against it, the south vs the north. 

Not  the biggest post anymore, if you put together cohesion and structural funds like the EU does. And the fight has been more like net exporters of food vs net importers. [Netherlands position about CAP reform](http://jsis.washington.edu/euc//file/2012%20MEU/Position%20paper%20CAP%20reform/Netherlands%20CAP%20Reform%20PositionPaper.pdf), has sided often with France and Spain. In that document they support a reform that the Spanish government opposed but the farmer unions supported the capping the subsidies for the biggest landowners, because we should allow to grow without limits the *more competitive* landowners.

I hope that this disapproval was because of my estimate and not because of the support of this under-the-surface racism that I still see in France. Just think how common it is in French to say ""Pédé"" and ""rebeuh."" I know lots of people that don't claim to be racist or homophone and regularly use these totally socially acceptable words.
Racism is a much bigger deal in France than it is in the United States. I'm an american/asian and I live in France and I can tell you with certitude that although the racism may not be overt, it is clearly visible under the surface. Of course it is not socially accepted, that is why it is veiled and covert and largely thriving. 
Americans do not have this problem at this scale. I agree with toointerested's assessment that there is racism here and it goes along with my opinion that France is like the US 50 years ago.

true,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","Yes, there is. I had an awful lot of Polish or Russian people in school that didn't take the English final exam because their education in their native language they got in afternoon or evening schools counted as a second language education.

The problem is that, in my experience in NRW around Düsseldorf (north of Cologne... it hurts to say that...), Polish and Russian immigrants care that their children get their German in order first and then they know so little of their native language that the parents put their children back into language school for native speakers. The primary school of my step brother even offered Russian as a native language for Russian immigrants. 

The Turks usually speak perfect Turkish. Maybe the writing is a bit weak. But it seems like the Turks often only speak Turkish at home and they are fully fluent in Turkish then but nobody ever bothered to explain to them how their language work. They have this native feel for it but that's about it. I've got that native feel as well for most things but I learnt about cases and gender in school. I learnt once how my language works and it didn't take much to read up on it when I needed it. Now, if I look at the wikipedia article about Icelandic, it's logical. I know basically everything from my native language and I learnt those concepts without the additional difficulty of using a foreign language in that process. 

In my experience, the people that struggle with German are the Turks that only spoke Turkish at home (or ME/Arabs in general. It seems like those are a lot more proud of their culture and language than others). As a counter example, I had one dude in school who went to Dubai for a few years in secondary school. He kind of missed out on German and Arabic orthography so his writing is shit. But he can express himself perfectly in German and Arabic because he actually had to sit down and learn the Arabic spoken in Dubai. He grew up with Arabic but not the same dialect. So he got into language school, learnt how languages work (he had a bit of that in Germany as well but it's rather spread out) and easily picked up the new Arabic dialect and his German improved as well according to him.",0,1386687442,null,0,false,0,cdy9m6x,t3_1sjhoe,t1_cdy9m6x,t1_cdy8cwm,null,1428299789,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

That's common practice. It's not relevant whether or not a politician is gay, so the media doesn't cover it unless they themselves are out publicly.

Older people are less likely to be swayed by pop culture so less likely to learn English organically. 

Assuming older people are less likely to be interested in pop culture, they are also unlikely to learn Dutch organically because they won't make Dutch friends. In my experience you can only learn so much by talking to people in shops and taxis or listening to strangers' conversations - you really need friends who are native speakers. If your culture is dramatically different from the culture of the language your learning it can be pretty damn hard to learn that language in an enjoyable way. I've lived in Romania and China and I find Romanian much easier not just for the obvious reasons, but because I find it much easier to make friends and relate to Romanians on a personal level because (tl;dr) the way our societies have taught us to think and relate to one another has more in common.

- trains just not showing up on regional train connection (it's a single track with 2 passing locations, so when one train has a delay the next one had to be canceled). Well can happen of course, but NO announcements on the tracks. Happened multiple times to me. Oh well, just wait another hour!  
- the unbelievable non-transperent jungle of ticket prices (granted, that's not only due to DB, but also the regional train network providers.). It's easier for a grandmother to pick the right mobile phone contract than finding the cheapest ticket to the next major city.

All'epoca un qualche minimale esempio di 3d era visibile solo su hardware specializzato da bar, o in iniziali implementazioni di ambienti 3d per Amiga.

Avere una cultura e far notare che questa consente, potenzialmente, di avere una visione maggiormente profonda delle cose, o senso critico, è una cosa non interpretabile. A parità di argomento tu puoi avere una cultura maggiore della mia, o diversa rispetto alla mia. Ma se la tua cultura su un dato argomento è inferiore alla mia, beh, non è da snob farti notare che a causa di questo la tua interpretazione dei fatti possa aver minor valore della mia. Sostenere il contrario significa dar voce aoole orde di antivaccinisti e via dicendo. Significa dire che la loro opinione, basata sulla loro -mancanza- di cultura su quell'argomento, ha lo stesso valore di uno che si è preso un dottorato in biologia.

I fatti non sono interpretabili. E' l'interpretazione dei fatti che può variare. E sono d'accordo che una interpretazione possa valere tanto quanto quella di un'altra. Ma se ti attieni ai fatti, allora quello che ne deduci non solo non è una interpretazione, ma inoltre tanto è maggiore la tua conoscenza dell'argomento, tanto più la tua deduzione ha valore.

Nell'ambito politico non ci sono differenze di scelte di visioni. Io scelgo di vedere le cose tramite una lente, tu puoi scegliere di vedere le cose tramite un'altra lente. Ed entrambi hanno la stessa dignità, e per fortuna, altrimenti non saremmo in democrazia. Ma poi ci sono i fatti, e per quanto possa non sembrare elegante dirlo, che Berlusconi sia votato in larga parte da casalinghe che al più guardano le telenovele è un fatto. E da quel fatto scaturiscono determinate considerazioni, le quali, entro un certo limite, sono univoche. Non esiste una cosa come il relativismo della realtà, altrimenti, tralasciando le considerazioni storiche, possiamo anche arrivare a dire che i salottini erano dei bravi ragazzi che combattevano per la libertà.

Politiquement, se réclamer des classes moyennes est porteur. Les enquêtes d'opinion montrent en effet que l'essentiel des Français estiment en faire partie. Mais ""personne n'arrive à se mettre d'accord sur la définition des classes moyennes"", constatent les quatre auteurs de l'étude. Pour les appréhender au mieux, ils se sont donc appuyés sur une définition forcément arbitraire. Ils ont relevé le ""niveau de vie"" des ménages, c'est-à-dire les revenus qu'ils touchent une fois décomptés leur contribution au système (les impôts) et ce qu'ils en reçoivent (les aides sociales) et après prise en compte du nombre de personnes par foyer (adulte ou enfant). 


Ils ont alors rangé dans les ""classes moyennes"" tous les ménages qui tournent autour du niveau de vie médian, à partir duquel 50 % d'entre eux gagnent plus et 50 % gagnent moins. Lorsque l'on saucissonne la population en dix tranches égales, les trois premières sont considérées comme les ""bas revenus"" (1, 2, 3), les trois suivantes (4, 5, 6) comme des ""classes moyennes inférieures"", les tranches 7 et 8 comme des ""classes moyennes supérieures"" et les deux dernières (9 et 10) comme les ""hauts revenus"". Selon cette définition, les classes moyennes correspondraient alors aux ménages d'une seule dont le revenu avant impôt est compris entre 1 200 euros et 1 600 euros par mois pour la classe moyenne inférieure, puis entre 1 600 et 2 700 euros pour la classe moyenne supérieure.""

&gt; Xenofobia e tornaconto sono motivi validi come altri

No che non sono motivi validi! Sono motivi sbagliatissimi per decidere. Si dovrebbe votare conoscendo le conseguenze a livello globale delle proprie scelte, e non solo il vicinissimo (spazialmente e temporalmente). Bisognerebbe votare per il bene comune, idealmente, o quantomeno con cognizione di causa. Se voti in modo ignorante, allora SI che la mia opinione conta piu' della tua. Ti faccio il classico esempio: se un referendum chiedesse: ""volete dimezzare istantaneamente tutte le tasse?"" tutta questa gente voterebbe immediatamente si, ""evvai, pago meno tasse!"". Prova ne sia che berlusconi [ci ha campato per anni](http://www.lettera43.it/upload/editor/tasse-1.jpg). Eppure avrebbe un effetto deleterio sull'italia, creerebbe scompensi enormi di bilancio, scompensi che pero' arriverebbero non subito, ma dopo uno due cinque anni. Io voterei immediatamente no a una proposta del genere, piuttosto preferirei leggermi una proposta di ridistribuzione dei soldi delle tasse che poi valuterei in modo informato (non necessariamente corretto, nota bene!).

&gt; Sarò fortunello io, ma di gente così ne conosco di persona

A mexican will have less problems in the US than somebody from Africa in Denmark. Especially since Danish is only spoken by a few million people.

The reason a Mexican will have less problems in the USA than someone from non-Anglophone Africa in Denmark, is that there are tens of millions of people in the USA who speak only Spanish, and tens of millions more who speak both Spanish and English. There are entire communities where Spanish is much more useful than English. The government provides services in Spanish. There are Spanish TV and radio stations, newspapers, publishers, and so on. The Mexican person doesn't need to learn a word of English unless social or economic incentives lead him to.

Wichtigste Frage: Was meinst du denn mit 'große Größen'? 

A) Ist sie (relativ) schlank, hat aber überproportial große Brüste?

*  Das heißt, du brauchst ein normales Band (70/75/80/85) mit besonders großem Körbchen (cup size) (E/F/G/H/...). Diese findest du am ehesten in speziellen Dessousgeschäften. Online empfiehlt sich Triumph. [Beispiel](http://de.triumph.com/BEAUTY-FULL%20CHARM/10133055,de_DE,pd.html&amp;cgid=5000000#color_0004_Black).

B) Oder ist sie allgemein recht moppelig (trägt Kleidergröße 42+) und kann deshalb keine BHs in normalen Geschäften kaufen?


* Das heißt, du brauchst ein weites Band (90/95/100/...) mit entsprechendem Körbchen. Diese findest du am besten in Übergrößengeschäften wie Ulla Popken. [Beispiel](http://www.ullapopken.de/de/modell/entlastungs-bh/658495/?campid=100&amp;adword=sem/pla&amp;partnerid=1017).

Allgemein rate ich aber davon ab, deiner Freundin BHs zu schenken, außer du bist dir 100% sicher, welche Größe sie trägt und welche Vorlieben sie hat.

Du bekommst halt extrem selten die ""richtigen"" Persönlichkeiten. Das ist auch eine der Sachen die ""Persönlichkeitspolitik"" so schwachsinnig und gefährlich machen.

&gt; Oh doch. Hatte iwann mal was von ihr gelesen, dass sie einfach keine Perspektive darin sieht, unbezahlt Politik zu machen und [...]

Sie hat viel kritisiert aber ich glaube nicht, dass etwas sie so hart getroffen hat wie das was sie *persönlich* angegriffen hat. 

&gt; Ein Idealist kann trotzdem vernünftige Entscheidungen treffem, sehe das Problem nicht.

Er kann aber auch die extrem falschen treffen. Deswegen wurde das System so aufgebaut wie es heute ist. 

Oder anders gesagt: es wurde wegen EINER Persönlichkeit so designed, dass es EINER Persönlichkeit nie wieder gelingt so eine Nummer abzuziehen. 

&gt; Übertreib doch nicht gleich.

Ich übertreibe nicht. Du hast oben geschrieben, die Wähler wären unmündig und man müsse ihre Macht begrenzen. Ich hätte das noch weiter auswalzen können indem ich gefragt hätte warum du unmündige Bürger überhaupt wählen lässt aber ich wollte irgendwie noch halbwegs am Thema bleiben ;)

&gt; Gegenseitige Machtbegrenzung der Instanzen ist doch völlig normal.

Wenn es eine gegenseitige Machtbegrenzung gleichwertiger Instanzen wäre, hätte ich auch absolut nichts dagegen. Das ist es hier halt nicht. Während die eine Instanz alle Rechte hat, hat die andere eher dekorative Rechte. Dummerweise ist auch noch die mit den dekorativen Rechten näher am Volk welches sie regiert während die die schon fast alles darf nun auch noch von Politikern in Rente mit mehr Macht beglückt werden sollen. 

Das ist mein Punkt.

@Lobbyismus
&gt; Würd ich jetzt nicht so einfach behaupten. 

Warum?

&gt; [...]schlimm wirds erst wenn man eine Gewisse Grenze (-&gt;Korruption) überschreitet. Das lässt sich durch zusätzliche Kompetenzen des EU-Parlaments locker ausgleichen.

Wo ist für dich den die Grenze zwischen Lobbyismus und Korruption? Ist es schon Korruption wenn Firmen (Konsortien) Gesetze diktieren, Subventionsverhalten manipulieren, Banken retten? Oder ist Korruption wenn einer einen Koffer rüberwachsen lässt?

OK...it's a trap. Ich finde Lobbyismus der von Unternehmen ausgeht ist immer Korruption. Das nennt sich jetzt anders und man geht danach auch mal zusammen essen. Etwas anderes ist es nicht.

&gt; Davon redet keiner, Schmidt will einen ""erstklassigen"" Mann, der der EU etwas plakatives über die Ländergrenzen hinweg gibt. Derjenige muss doch nicht mal zusätzliche Funktion oder Amt haben, das ist dann einfach jmd der wegen besonderen Qualitäten hervorsticht

Hast du das Buch gelesen? Ich nicht. Alles was ich habe ist das:

&gt; **DIE ZEIT:** Haben wir also eine Führungskrise in Europa?

&gt; **Schmidt:** Wie Sie es nennen wollen, ist mir egal. Die Tatsache, dass wir nicht einmal einen erstklassigen Mann an der Spitze der Europäischen Kommission in Brüssel haben, spricht Bände. 

Einen Mann an der Spitze. Ich weiss nicht woher du deine Interpretation nimmst aber sollte sie nicht aus dem Buch stammen, finde ich, sie ist nicht haltbar. 

Hier sitzt eine senile ex-Persönlichkeit die eindeutig zu viel gelobt wurde und wünscht sich nun auch solch eine vielgelobte Persönlichkeit an der Spitze der EU. Ich würde da jetzt nicht zu viel reininterpretieren. So tiefgehend waren die restlichen Antworten auch nicht.

&gt; Vergleich das doch so: Jeder Politik-interessierte hat doch bitteschön Lieblingspolitiker.

Ist das so? Ich war schon politisch interessiert bevor ich wählen konnte. Ich habe keinen Lieblingspolitiker. In meiner Umgebung sehe ich auch eher Leute die genau das Gegenteil haben: einen absoluten Hasspolitiker. Aber wer weiss, vielleicht bekennen sich die meisten nicht. Im Moment würde mir auch niemand von den halbwegs relevanten direkt einfallen zu dem man sich schamlos bekennen könnte...

&gt; Ja wieso denn eigentlich, ist das jetzt ein Führer? Nein, es ist ein ganz normaler Mensch, mit einer Persönlichkeit, die den Betrachter quasi beeindruckt und v.a. mitreißt, wegen welchen Qualitäten auch immer.

Ich sage es mal mit deinen Worten ""Übertreib nicht"". Ich habe dir oben schon bei deiner Auflistung gezeigt, dass es halt einen großen Unterschied gibt zwischen dem gewählten Politiker der abgewählt werden kann und einem Politiker der über 3 Ecken, 5 Beziehungen und 9 Lobbyisten an die Macht gekommen ist. Solche Politiker haben entsprechende Moralvorstellungen. Solche Positionen schaffen eine Umgebung in der Persönlichkeiten gut WIE schlecht ganz groß werden können und ich sehe es nicht ein den Preis zu zahlen in der Hoffnung es wird dieses mal eine gute Persönlichkeit die sich da auf die Position irgendwie gebracht hat. Das ist einfach zu gefährlich und zu naiv.

&gt; Ich möchte nicht sagen, dass der Steinbrück mein Lieblingspolitiker ist, aber der Kerl ja mal bitte verdammt krass drauf. Auf jeden Fall ganz oben auf meiner Liste dabei. 

Ja wie Raab halt auch...für die einen ist es krass, bei anderen löst es Fremdscham aus. Geschmackssache aber glücklicherweise komplett irrelevant nun ;)

* Les spécificités de la littérature française : pour être franche, la littérature française d'aujourd'hui, celle qui gagne les prix littéraires et gagne des critiques dans Télérama... c'est de l'enculage de mouches. On tourne autour du pot et on se fait chier. C'est une manière d'écrire propre à la France, et qui passe assez mal à l'étranger.

* La littérature de genre, par contre, est très prometteuse et se vend très bien (je pense notamment à une maison d'édition SF/fantasy qui a fait quelques ventes de folie à l'étranger ces 2 dernières années). Seul souci : c'est une niche. Peu de maisons françaises s'y intéressent, peu de maisons étrangères s'y risquent. Les gros travaillent donc entre eux et font confiance aux valeurs sûres, et il est quasiment impossible pour un auteur débutant aujourd'hui de s'exporter.

* Les auteurs anglophones se vendent dans le monde entier parce qu'ils ont des agents aux méthodes rodées, aux carnets d'adresses bien remplis et aux dents longues qui n'hésitent pas à s'investir pour vendre leurs poulains. La France n'utilise pas du tout cette méthode. Un agent d'auteur est très mal perçu ici, on préférera passer par la maison d'édition pour s'exporter. Les maisons ayant des catalogues énormes à gérer, les responsables de droits ne peuvent généralement passer que peu de temps sur la promotion de leurs bouquins. C'est là que les agences littéraires comme celle dans laquelle j'ai travaillé entrent en jeu ; mais elles ont encore très peu nombreuses (5-6 à tout casser), restent confidentielles (ça emmerde les maisons d'édition de devoir nous lâcher une commission qui paie pourtant à peine de loyer) et doivent se battre pour être prises au sérieux par les français comme les étrangers.


Dantec se vend très bien à l'international. J'ai essayé de pousser Bordage que j'adore hors de nos frontières, mais on m'a à chaque fois répondu que la SF est une niche qui se vend mal et que plus personne n'achète les droits de titres qui n'ont pas vendu des milliers d'exemplaires dans leur pays d'origine.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;But, again, other countries obviously disagree that Sweden's standards are necessary or better.

I don't think they disagree, they just don't give a fucking shit. It is a *scientific fact* that tobacco is bad for you, that is hardly news. The have not facts that proves it is good - none. Yet the EU keeps shitting on that fact and force us to support tobacco. So, they just don't give a flying fuck, they just want money. It is a *scientific fact* that we overuse antibiotic, a lot, and we should try to use less. Yet the EU don't listen to us and we don't get any bonus for not using one fifht of what the French use, in our agriculture. In fact, we get less per cow than the French, not because of any *science* that could be logical (as in for example our cows were smaller due to being indoor more, or something), but because of arbitrary reasons that the south have come up with (not scienced based) to squeeze money out of us. It is a *scientific fact* that we need to work for the environment, yet they constantly vote against it. 

So apparetnly these people who wastly outnumber us, don't give a flying fuck about the environment and are constantly working against us who are trying to improve things. Everything they have done, how they act and how they vote prove it. Otherwise they wouldn't have fought against improvement in the CAP, which they have done, *every single time*. They just want money from us. Why would we want to be in a union with people who ignore science, ignore improving themselves, pay less taxes but want us to pay for them? And they outnumber us. 

It is also a *fact* that we pay more taxes than anybody (apart from the Danes) both by actually paying them, but also per percentage. Why should we pay for people who do not bother to pay their taxes and pay less?


&gt;My own country had just made it to net payer status just before the current crisis. And the current crisis makes it a little unfair to judge how countries are doing - Sweden itself very nearly became a net beneficiary in 2009.

No, it doesn't. Sweden is out of the crises, the south isn't, and it is good reason for that. And, the crises forces *us* who are not involved in it, to pay decades and billions more, when we have done nothing. *If* the Eurocountries were interested in solving it, they could, one way or another (I'd say abandon the Euro, but to each their own), but the current crises probably will be going on for decades. It is not unfair to judge the EU and several of its key countries for one of its absolutely biggest failures.I think the Euro is heading towards Japan btw, it will be an interesting next 20 years....So, that is definately fair to judge the EU for it. Why should we remove stuff that the Euro countries have fucked up? 


&gt;There I'd agree with you. But, as others have pointed out, what ""the EU"" - that is, the institutional EU - wants is not the problem. And when it comes to the whole ""take take take with no improvement or intention to improve"", we're really talking about Greece, because the other countries have improved. Italy, which seems to fomr part of your critique, is a net payer, not a net recipient.

The countries do not want improvement. And, Italy is doing worse than ever and is becoming a net recipient soon. France is also going down. 

Even so, there is absolutely no reason to give more money to Greece, or the south. But as I have proven, the EU and its member countries to a majority do not care about science, nor do they seem to have any moral. They are only interested in more money from us, that is all they want. Otherwise, their behaviour would be different, but as we all can see it is not. 

I fear what the EU is turning into. I see how they have fucked up the CAP, fucked up the Euro, fucked up almost everything they have laid their hands on, and they, instiutions or countries don't give a shit, they just want more, more money, more power. We are being vastly outnumbered by people who don't care about the things we care about, who are far more corrupt, don't give a shit about science, pay less taxes etc, and it is bad to stay in an environment like that. If we are outside, at least our faith will be in our own hands, and not in the fucking hands of the French agricultural minister.

Wow! What is it with the Anglophone hate on this sub? 

I agree that lots of Anglophones don't learn new languages. This is to do with need, rather than humility. Most Anglophones don't need to learn a new language for either professional or personal reasons, because English is, for better or worse, very widely used across the globe.  Equally, the reason why lots of non Anglophones learn English is not because of humility, but again because of need. 

As another poster mentioned, I agree that in most cases it makes sense to learn the language of the country you are living in. I would advise those Brits who live in Spain to try and speak Spanish. Many of them will be pensioners however and might not have had the advantages of a good education and therefore learning Spanish might not be easy for them. And of course, arguably they don't need to learn Spanish.

true,ITALIANCOLOGNE,NRHW,"Italy and Germany - fuck yeah. ","True, because a big majority of Mexicans in the US come from poor families with very poor chances of learning English. The average knowledge of English in Mexico in below average but the more educated people can speak it *somewhat* fluently. While English is the second language in Mexico, Danish is only being taught in a few countries as secondary language. Africa and Eastern Europe don't.   
While a US-American doesn't have to talk to Mexicans in a second language (since you guys are native speakers) a Dane would have to switch from Danish to English to talk to somebody from Nigeria who also switches from his language into English.   
The problem that a lot of people seem to have is that they have to talk to immigrants in a foreign language. But since they think that immigration doesn't require input from both parties (hence the term INtegration). While I personally don't agree with this sentiment it's understandable that people don't want to ""change"" for some random African dude. Something that can be observed in many Scandinavian countries (excluding Denmark and a few other countries) is something that some people call ""EXtegration"". This oposite behavior to integration can also be observed in the Near East where people try to make themselves ""more international"". Since Danish (in comparison to German or French) is only a minor language spoken by a few million people extegration policies could be very benefitial. Of course a country like Britain, Australia or the US doesn't need to extegrate. Their language is the most popular in the world.  
So while the US is the goal of many national integration policies (that's why we learn English in school) Denmark would be probably better off if they'd encourage a more liberal approach to get along with foreigners.   
On the other hand the US would probably reduce a few problems if they'd teach Spanish in their schools.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;It is a scientific fact that tobacco is bad for you, that is hardly news. The have not facts that proves it is good - none. Yet the EU keeps shitting on that fact and force us to support tobacco. So, they just don't give a flying fuck, they just want money.

But it's already been pointed out that tobacco growing *doesn't* get subsidised - and no amount of swearing will make it so!

&gt;It is a scientific fact that we need to work for the environment, yet they constantly vote against it. 

Eh, they're hardly alone there, and that's hardly a southern thing.

&gt;It is also a fact that we pay more taxes than anybody (apart from the Danes) both by actually paying them, but also per percentage. Why should we pay for people who do not bother to pay their taxes and pay less?

I suspect that if you looked at what your taxes are spent on, you might find somewhat more spending that you object to than the €144/year your EU contribution comes to.

&gt;No, it doesn't. Sweden is out of the crises, the south isn't, and it is good reason for that. And, the crises forces us who are not involved in it, to pay decades and billions more, when we have done nothing.

Your point was about the structural funds over the decades. My point is the current crisis situation - which did affect Sweden, and which had a depressing effect on everybody's economy. Whether you're right about ""decades"" - I could say 'wait and see', but decades is unrealistic anyway.

&gt;The countries do not want improvement. And, Italy is doing worse than ever and is becoming a net recipient soon. France is also going down.

And once again you're drawing trend lines through short runs of data. If I drew a trend line through Sweden's net contributions a couple of years, ago, I could have said that Sweden too was ""going down"".

&gt;Even so, there is absolutely no reason to give more money to Greece, or the south. But as I have proven, the EU and its member countries to a majority do not care about science, nor do they seem to have any moral. They are only interested in more money from us, that is all they want. Otherwise, their behaviour would be different, but as we all can see it is not.

Whether Sweden is a net payer or not is not what determines the behaviour of other countries, and there's plenty of ignoring science being done by countries which are bigger net payers than Sweden.

&gt;I fear what the EU is turning into. I see how they have fucked up the CAP, fucked up the Euro, fucked up almost everything they have laid their hands on, and they, instiutions or countries don't give a shit, they just want more, more money, more power. We are being vastly outnumbered by people who don't care about the things we care about, who are far more corrupt, don't give a shit about science, pay less taxes etc, and it is bad to stay in an environment like that. If we are outside, at least our faith will be in our own hands, and not in the fucking hands of the French agricultural minister.

Madrid, as an European city is not very pretty, but it has some of the best art museums in the world. In my experience, they were the least friendly people, but it's more compared to other Spanish cities, where the people are super friendly.

Barcelona is my favorite Spanish city, because is very much alive, the architecture is amazing and varied (from Medieval to Modern), and La Rambla, is a great walk that ends almost the Mediterranean. Well, it's a great place to spend a few days and get a taste of Mediterranean culture. Also Catalanes are very friendly, and have their own traditions and language, which makes the experience even more enjoyable.

Northern Spain is also gorgeous, especially in the summer. It's green, and have gorgeous mountains in the background. Full or Rias and smaller cities, it's a great place to travel if you like the whole town hopping and gorgeous drives type of vacation. Bilbao was a surprise, every tour book said it was ugly, and well, it wasn't!

My last trip to Spain was to Andalucia, it is where all the ""Spanish"" cliches are born, and are still alive! The cities with a mix of Moorish and Baroque, the flamenco, the tiny white towns, and the Plaza de Toros. Some parts are very touristy, but if you go in Spring or Fall, you avoid the beach goers and can really enjoy the more Spanish towns like Seville, Granada, Cadiz, Jerez (if your parents like to drink Sherry). There are many things to chose from and a well planned trip (with driving) can be extremely enjoyable.

Sorry for the long post, but I've visited a few times and must say, never had a bad time. So it depends what your parents are into, they can tailor their vacation, especially if they are fluent in Spanish.

Can you PLEASE read what I'm writing? I'm not 'blaming' Germany for everything, I provided some reasons as to why Germany is co-responsible for aspects of the current situation, and even more specifically, I answered as to why people take issue with Germany. That does not mean that people ONLY take issue with Germany, and don't blame anything else. 
Well, some do, sure, but there are crazies in every society and country. 

It's really silly to try and 'blame' the common people for such complicated situations, whether German or Greek. We live in an age of free trade, globalization and common currencies, and you want to really put the blame on some ""inherently bad people""? Do you honestly believe that? I guess if you were Greek you would support Golden Dawn then, right?

If you really want to get at the origins of the issue you have to go as far back as Ottoman rule that instilled a culture of bribing and cheating authorities, or to be more recent, the WWII occupation wherein certain dynasties were developed in Greece, who still hold power up to today and prefer to accommodate foreign interests (you are aware that a German king was imposed in Greece for some time, after WWII?), and you then have to also take into account the fact that countries in the Eurozone no longer produce their own currency but are borrowing from banks, which in turn borrow from the ECB, and this whole system is designed primarily by Germany, to serve German interests. 

If the part about dynasties sounds weird, you can start researching with googling about the Porter report to president Truman regarding the Marshall Plan for Greece, or a recent article in German magazine Stern about the families that essentially control all Greek publications and infrastructure deals. 

Germany is looking out for Germany, which is only natural. And even more specifically, specific banking elites are looking out for specific banking elites. Germany is gaining tens of billions by this entire 'crisis', while the so-called 'bailouts' for Greece were bailouts for German and French banks (mostly), while sending Greece back to the stone age as far as unemployment, healthcare, working rights, etc., are concerned. 

Anyway, I'm rambling, I used to research enough about the issue but I can't take it anymore. 


All I'm saying is it's not as simple as saying ""lol Greek people are to blame"". Up to a few years ago all you'd read was about how good Greek economy was doing. Normal people don't really know what's happening behind closed doors, nor can they do much to change the stats quo.

I would recommend going in spring, as the orange trees blossom and you can smell them, also they wont battle the 45ºC of the summer. The food is amazing. From there yo can easily go to Cordoba and Granada.

Madrid: if your parents are into art this is place to go, [Prado](http://www.museodelprado.es/en/), [Thyssen](http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/home) and [reina sofia](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en) are just the most well knowed musseums but there are tons. In my opinion Madrid is not a monumental city, we don't have a tour Eiffel or a Brandenburg gate or a big ben, but is one of the nicest cities I know. They'll have a ton of things to do and it's very well connected to the rest of Spain. Look into AVE, high velocity trains, madrid-seville in 2:15 hours.

Cordoba is great and the [Mezquita](https://www.google.es/search?q=catedral+de+cordoba&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=UDS&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xUenUqDhFaun0wWZ-4CgDA&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1133&amp;bih=532#q=mezquita+cordoba&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch) is another impressive as shit building. 

Santiago de Compostela is a relatively small but great city. The weather can be harsh as in parts of galicia it rains more than in England.

Sbagliato. Non e' questione di efficienza, e' questione proprio delle promesse, che erano irrealizzabili a priori. Semplicemente non c'e' modo di abbassare le tasse, senza mandare a puttane l'economia intera. Non si puo', le promesse erano un inganno fin dall'inizio.

Why should they be forced to learn the language if they don't aim higher than that? Probably those people only come for a few months each year anyway. 

For example, during the summer, we have many seasonal workers from the Baltics in Cyprus. Their main skill is that they are fluent in Russian, and they help us give a better experience to our main volume of tourists, which are Russian and Ukrainian. There are not enough Cypriots fluent in Russian to cover the demand. The people from the Baltics leave when the tourist season is over. 

They are actually trying to pass a law to make speaking Greek a requirement, but it's just stupid and if they try to enforce it, it will harm our only GDP-creating sector that's still alive. Very few tourists come from Greece or internally from Cyprus. We have plenty of Greek-speaking staff in the tourism sector already (48% of the staff are Cypriots).

Children learn *differently*, though. Adults actually have many advantages when it comes to learning a second language, because they can relate to new words in different ways, using existing mental hooks and a preexisting larger vocabulary to speed up the process. 

For instance, I can tell you that a large part of the English vocabulary is of French origin. Almost all words ending -ible (possible, accessible, credible), -able (probable, comfortable, acceptable), -ant (consonant, absorbant, distant), -ent (ambient, imminent, violent) are exactly the same in French. You pronounce them differently, and that's all. Words ending -ary become -aire (necessary -&gt; necessaire, secretary -&gt; secretaire). Congrats, you now know a couple thousand words in French.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"Tobacco, is being subsidied, I posted correct links afterwards which I also explained to you.  Also, why do we get less per cow than the French? Why does no one care about the antibiotics use etc etc? And it is a southern thing when it comes to the CAP- the single biggest post in the budget. The north is generally siding with us. 

But, I have a suggestion then.  If it doesn't matter- remove the CAP and let us take care of our own agriculture. According to you they are so enormously science and environment friendly, so let us remove it and see will be most scientific and environmental in ten years. If according to you we are all alike, the the Greeks will be more science oriented than us. I do not believe that, but I will happily take that bet, anytime, that we will be and are more science and environmentally oriented, than the south in our agriculture. 

And, if countries that are net payers ignore science that is hardly an excuse.  That os stupid. We do it too.i hate that.  But, at least I don't have to pay for them. 

And, if Sweden give so little, perhaps we can stop and Greece give more? Or Portugal? Why should we always be the one to pay and lower out standards? Why can't they pay? They eve pay far less in taxes, so we pay for us and them. That is hardly fair. 

Decades is not unrealistic. If you look at the current development. It has been five years and Greece have a debt of 170%. How are you going to fix that? And, take a look at Japan- are they unrealistic? The Eurozone (EZ ) is looking more and more like it and it is hardly just me saying that. 

Same with Italy and France- that is not short term trend lines. Their growth has been bad for a long time and Italy is coming into the ""can't handle the debt territory"". But please,don't take my word for it. I am on my phone but go to WSJ, Handelblatt, FT or whatever huge financial publication. You choose and read the analysis. Please do! Sweden were never near that territory (we might when our housing bubble blows, but different story) 


And, again,why are we still throwing money in the bottomless pit that is the south after 32! years? Is that how the EU manages my money? That is bad governing,but the south outnumber us and vote for more transfers, always. That is really the heart of it- the south gave no need to change as long as we pay for them.  There are several well funded economical theories about that actually and again, if the EU cared about science they would read up on that. But then the transfers would stop, so we ignore science and vote for the north to pay, pay,pay. 

Emotions- of course but it is hardly emotions to state facts.  Facts are that we are outnumbered by people who pay less taxes, are generally more corrupt, want to keep us paying for them, are far less interested in science and environment, something one can see from their behaviour, do not care about lessening the CAP. One can also see that the structural funds are crap, but the want to keep them. All that is facts. Why would anyone want to be in a union like that?

just to point this out, this is about immigrants, the ones that applied to come and usually should have some kind of qualification to be allowed in. refugees are protected by EU law and as everyone should be aware

EU law breaks country law breaks state law breaks regional law

The objective is to spread knowledge and wisdom regarding organic farming, and not to make money.

There are farmers that also offer to work in environment-friendly house building, and even if bakery is not common, you may find someone who also does that.

To benefit from the services of that association, you have to pay, but that's for maitaining the network, and not to make someone richer.

Liebe Leser,

wir haben noch einmal bei dem Prada-Geschäft in der Residenzstraße in München nachgefasst. Der erste Teil der Geschichte hat sich exakt so zugetragen. Die Kundin, deren Mops vor dem Laden gestorben ist, sei Stammkundin und namentlich bekannt, und natürlich habe ihr das Personal geholfen, wie beschrieben: also mit Seidenpapier fürs Einwickeln und einer großen Prada-Tüte. Was kann der dahingeschiedene Mops dafür, dass sich seine reale Geschichte so unangenehm mit einer offenbar unverwüstlichen, dubios wiederkehrenden „urban legend“ kreuzt? Den Verbleib der entwendeten Mopsleiche würden wir natürlich auch noch gerne klären.

true,ITALIANCOLOGNE,NRHW,"Italy and Germany - fuck yeah. ","I don't think it's hate against Anglophones. It's more like an aversion to everything that comes from the UK. This is a pro-EU sub and the Anti-EU bullshit that was spilled by Cameron during the last few years made many mainland Europeans bitter and angry. I'm neither justifying nor agreeing with this sentiment even though I can somewhat understand why people don't like Britain that much.  
This is also somewhat related to the fact that Labour made second languages optional in the UK in 2004 (?). The fact that the UK governments always had this ""learn English or gtfo; why do we need to learn a second language? We speak English"" attitude isn't really helping to combat the stereotype that UK students don't know shit when it comes to other languages.  You can easily can live in Spain without knowing Spanish however if you read about the UK throwing a fit because some Indian immigrant doesn't know English it makes the UK seem a bit hypocritical.  I understand that more people know English than Indian in Europe but basically cancelling languages from the educational program is not beneficial at all.   
The problem however is that a lot of people in Spain, Italy, France and other ""warm"" countries don't speak English. It's an effort to speak in another language. You probably don't realize this since you never had somebody come to your country demanding to be served in his language but not everybody has some university English certificate and many people struggle and or need to make a huge effort to speak English semi-fluently.  
The point is: If you go to a country where English isn't the official language and you don't even TRY to learn their language you look like an asshole. You go to someone's country and demand that he makes an effort so that you can speak to him in YOUR native tongue. While most tourists in England make an effort to speak in YOUR language. Of course English is the most important language in the world but having such a demanding attitude isn't good.     
I'm not saying that I agree with the hate and I really don't want to generalize. However I have met MANY people who don't speak anything but English and don't even try to learn the language. Whether it's an exchange student from the UK or some random friend from Scotland.  
It has something to do with respect. Of course we can easily talk in English but keep in mind that this is not our native language. Many people don't have 12 years of English classes in school. If they speak to you in English they are doing you a favor. They could also say 'Screw you' and talk in their language and you (not you personally) would look like a fool running around in a country without basic communication skills. You know how some people speak academic English instead of their local dialect that they use at home? Just like they do you a favor ""we"" are helping Anglophones by talking in English.  
Sometimes Swiss or Austrians try to talk in ""High German"" and use ""High German"" words instead of their local vocabulary. They are doing it to do Germans a favor.  
The same goes with this subreddit. What would happen if everybody would write in their native language?  You would probably understand Italian, French, maybe Spanish and maybe Portuguese. That's pretty nice however somebody who doesn't know any other language besides English would be screwed.  That's just my opinion though and I can't speak for the guy you replied to.

When it comes to the environment and paying taxes, yes, we are better. Not at other things, sports and media comes to mind immediately, as the producing industry in Germany, and probably a million things more. So, better is a relative term, in some things, but not in others. 

However, the cultural differences seems to be enormous, and they are hardly changing and/or improving. Look at the corruption and tax loyalty for example. Those are things that are essential for a working state/union/society.  However, they are not really improving, are they. Italy are as corrupt as ever.

Also, as I have proven- the EU makes things worse for us. They do not have to of course, but they choose to. And, they have had the CAP for decades. If that is how the EU run things, - why should we settle for that? Why should we settle for having a worse agricultural policy and environmental policy? Please explain that? Also, explain why we should accept being discriminated? Why would we want to be in a union that does that on purpose? If the EU is so good, why does it keep on doing things like that? Should we accept that? 

Furthermore- and you even agree. I try not to pass bills to my non existing grand children.  As it is now, my children have to pay for the south, probably my grandchildren will pay off Greece's debt. Why should we settle for that? 

Furthermore- if we keep on footing the bills they will never learn.  Look at Estonia and Poland, Estonia didn't exist when Greece, Spain and Portugal joined, but now they are paying.

He bounced around from with different relatives, militant groups attempted to recruit him, etc. He finally claimed asylum in the US.

He was so grateful for what most of us take for granted.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Thanks for you for response.

&gt; I don't think it's hate against Anglophones. It's more like an aversion to everything that comes from the UK. 

I think you need to be careful with this attitude. An aversion to everything from the UK is getting close to xenophobia. Imagine if I said I was averse to everything that came from Italy? 

&gt; This is a pro-EU sub and the Anti-EU bullshit that was spilled by Cameron during the last few years made many mainland Europeans bitter and angry. I'm neither justifying nor agreeing with this sentiment even though I can somewhat understand why people don't like Britain that much.

This is not a pro-EU sub. This is a European sub. There are Europeans that post frequently that are not from EU member states (Norwegians and Swiss). There are EUphiles and there are EUsceptics, from both UK and other Member States. If you only want to encounter EUphile views, this is not the right sub for you.  

&gt; This is also somewhat related to the fact that Labour made second languages optional in the UK in 2004 (?). 

Technically, they made it optional after the age of 14. I think it is still required between 11 and 14. I think the current government are trying to make language learning compulsory until 16, which I think is a good idea because I think it is part of a wide education.

&gt; The fact that the UK governments always had this ""learn English or gtfo; why do we need to learn a second language? We speak English"" attitude isn't really helping to combat the stereotype that UK students don't know shit when it comes to other languages. 

The UK is pretty welcoming to immigrants and that we have had huge levels of immigration because of it. 

&gt; You can easily can live in Spain without knowing Spanish however if you read about the UK throwing a fit because some Indian immigrant doesn't know English it makes the UK seem a bit hypocritical. I understand that more people know English than Indian in Europe but basically cancelling languages from the educational program is not beneficial at all.

There isn't a language called Indian. To be honest, Indians tend to speak English extremely well and English is spoken very widely in India. I have never met an Indian who has difficulty with English. But anyway, I understand your point. I'd say that it is more important for a working-aged person to learn a local language than a pensioner, because a working-aged person has a greater need to interact with the local people.

&gt; The point is: If you go to a country where English isn't the official language and you don't even TRY to learn their language you look like an asshole. You go to someone's country and demand that he makes an effort so that you can speak to him in YOUR native tongue. While most tourists in England make an effort to speak in YOUR language. Of course English is the most important language in the world but having such a demanding attitude isn't good.

I think it depends partly how long you are going to a place and other factors too. I normally try and speak something in the native language, but I travel a great deal for work and sometimes just go to places for 24 hours and sometimes on very short notice. How many languages do you expect me to have to know? Also, it is not just anglophones who expect people to know English. Frequently I have come across, for instance, Dutch, Danes, Swedes, travelling in other countries who don't speak the language of that country and try and communicate with the locals in English. 

I do agree though, that there is a way to be polite to people when you are in their country and this can be done either by trying to speak their language or alternatively by being grateful when they try and speak your language. But I am not sure that it is fair to say that Brits are less respectful than other people.

&gt; The same goes with this subreddit. What would happen if everybody would write in their native language? You would probably understand Italian, French, maybe Spanish and maybe Portuguese. That's pretty nice however somebody who doesn't know any other language besides English would be screwed. 

We'd all be screwed. Nobody knows every language. :)

In my view, one of the problems that Brits have with foreign languages, in addition to not really needing them, is that even if we want to learn one we can't be sure which one to choose. I chose French and Italian at random, but I have always felt embarrassed that I don't know German. 

I was once at dinner in Paris with one other British person and four French people. The French people all spoke English, I spoke French, but my British friend didn't speak very much French at all. So we had to speak English during the dinner. The French people complained (jokingly) that it wasn't fair that we were speaking English, as there were four of them and only two of us and we were in Paris. But if you think about it, this situation could occur anywhere. My British friend wasn't being rude - he did speak German fluently and was only in Paris for the weekend.

These towns are old logging towns. They get several meters of snow per year. Logging companies were having a hard time finding people that wanted to live there, even though the pay was good. When word made it to Norway and Sweden people came in droves. After all they were used to cold, snowy, and dark winters. The only problem is they didn't get along with each other all that well. So you got towns that would speak Swedish, have Swedish restaurants, and their entire logging company would use Swedish. Then you would have the mirror image in Norwegian. Granted their kids learned English at school but they kept speaking their native languages at home. This carried down through generations.

Vu les budgets engagés dans les campagnes publicitaires, il n'est pas étonnant que le client soit extrêmement prudent dans ses choix. On peut toujours, bien sûr, regretter qu'il ait manqué d'audace.

En l'absence d'indices réels d'une idéologie raciste, je pense qu'on devrait s'abstenir de ce genre d'accusation peu fondées, et plutôt féliciter ceux qui ont pris le pari de faire des choix atypiques pour leurs modèles. Mais il est plus spectaculaire de blâmer que de louer.

La contexte actuel est eput être différent, mais ce type discours me rappelle les années 80, les années [Touche pas à mon pote](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touche_pas_%C3%A0_mon_pote) pendant lesquelles les accusations de racisme étaient lancées parfois un peu vite. Car c'est exactement ce qu'elle fait: son client fait une demande parfaitement rationnelle d'un portrait représentant la majorité des femmes françaises, et vlan! on le traite de raciste hypocrite lorsqu'il refuse des portraits présentant des traits techniquement minoritaires tout en évitant les mots qui fâchent.

C'est assez sidérant que trente ans plus tard, les mots ""noir"", ""maghrébin"" voire ""asiatique"" soient toujours plus ou moins tabous, dans ce sens qu'on ne peut pas les prononcer sans craindre de passer pour un raciste; on peut dire ""la rousse à l’accueil"" sans problème mais plus difficilement ""la noire à l'accueil"" (certes s'est aussi peu civil que de dire ""le petit gros à l'accueil""). Les connotations sont coriaces, il est vrai (dans un autre registre certains utilisent encore ""homo"" ou équivalent en guise d'insulte), mais quand même.

Cette promptitude à pointer du doigt est aussi dangereuse. C'est crier au loup quand le loup n'y est peut-être pas. C'est banaliser l'accusation de racisme au risque qu'elle perde de sa gravité. Et c'est peut être pour cela qu'on en est au même point que dans les années 80.

Now the new 'popular' origins for immigrants do the same thing. Indians will congregate together, Russians/Eastern Europeans, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc. If you go to certain parts of Chicago, or other major cities, to this day you will sometimes have difficulty finding English speakers, kids are usually your best bet. Today, usually it does not take more than a generation for them to integrate though. Although I think that is because there is much more of a focus on education than in the past. Most of my friends are immigrants from Eastern Europe, they were born there, but if you were talking to all of us you would not be able to tell who was born in the US or Ukraine, or Russia. 

Most of the Western European immigrants/expats know English and typically have high paying jobs. But they will still try to find other people from their home countries to hang out with, at least the ones I know.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; [citation needed] The US is pretty stingy on social benefits and it constantly receives masses of immigrants.

That's the point: even reduced social benefits will still be attractive, so there will remain a surplus of labor on the market, keeping wages low and unemployment high, therefore keeping taxes low and therefore keeping public services low.

&gt;You probably would let people die on the street because they're filthy immigrants (probably even brown!) and refuse education for their children, but I'm just not that type of person.

The point is that due to the wealth disparity even just education and healthcare sounds like heaven on earth for most of the world population. This is not a meaningful check on the numbers of immigrants. Besides, what kind of plan is that: ""reduce public services so they won't be overtaxed""?

&gt;Well, they work, they pay taxes from which you the citizen get benefits.

Eh.. unemployment in Europe is between 5 and 25%: and that's even for people who have average education and are familiar with the language and customs of the county they live in. How will the kind of immigrants that would come in on top of that, with hypothetical open borders, fare in the job market do you think?

&gt;After a few years of doing that, they could be given the right to vote and the security that comes with being a citizen of the country you've been living in peacefully for years.

If that is how the EU run things, - why should we settle for that? Why should we settle for having a worse agricultural policy and environmental policy? Please explain that? 

As far as I can see, you don't. The EU sets minimum standards, and Sweden goes well beyond them to keep its own high standards. Through the EU, Sweden also can push for higher standards in other European countries. 

&gt;Also, explain why we should accept being discriminated? Why would we want to be in a union that does that on purpose? If the EU is so good, why does it keep on doing things like that? Should we accept that?

I'm not sure how you're ""being discriminated"". If your current housing bubble bursts, you may find yourselves in a position where the money flow reverses - it's not discrimination that makes you a net payer, it's just the budgetary maths.

&gt;Furthermore- and you even agree. I try not to pass bills to my non existing grand children. As it is now, my children have to pay for the south, probably my grandchildren will pay off Greece's debt. Why should we settle for that?

Officially - and I'll grant that the word ""officially"" rings a little hollow when it comes to Greece - it's the Greeks who will be paying off Greek debt.

&gt;Furthermore- if we keep on footing the bills they will never learn. Look at Estonia and Poland, Estonia didn't exist when Greece, Spain and Portugal joined, but now they are paying. That is the essence of the south- look at the development of Greece and compare it with Vietnam, Korea, Estonia, Poland etc. do you really think it is good to keep on transferring money to Greece the way we are doing?

Even if I'm reluctant to damn all future generations of Greeks with a claim they'll always be as bad as Greeks have historically been, it's hard not to agree.

However, it would be fair to point out that the money that meant Greece didn't have to do anything about their internal issues from 2000 up to the crisis was actually market borrowings, not EU money.",0,1386707876,null,0,false,0,cdyip74,t3_1sgdtv,t1_cdyip74,t1_cdyfsxw,null,1428281878,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Let's assume you are making and selling a product internationally, while paying your workers in Mark.Then either you or your customers needs to buy Marks at some point, so that you can pay your workers in them(really pay German taxes, which both you and your workers **need** Marks for). 

Now your workers could import more goods with their higher valued salaries, but many products would not be imported, and more importantly rents and mortgages have no concept of objective value and increase to how much the renter/borrower can pay, for a myriad of reasons. So wages tend to not be negotiated downwards to compensate for the increased currency value, and strangely neither are hours. 

Anyway, because of increased value of the currency, international customers need to work more hours to afford the Mark needed to pay for your products, which is not desirable for them. 

Devaluation of currency by feeding the international demand through printing,basically increasing supply to a ideally limited and slow changing demand, allows people to work less hours for your products and thus makes it more accessible

Description:
Nous habitons sur une fermette qui abrite une coopérative de 3 personnes (Emanuel 37 ans, Mickael 27 ans et Erik 51 ans). Nous fabriquons du pain biologique pétri à la main et cuit au feu de bois. La boulangerie se situe en pleine campagne au milieu de vergers et de champs. Notre souhait est de montrer qu’avec peu de moyens on peut tout de même créer une boulangerie bio à la campagne. C'est donc dans cet esprit que la boulangerie accueille de nombreux groupes d'enfants. Nous fabriquons pains, pizzas, tartes grâce aux produits du verger/potager que nous vendons sur les marchés, dans le réseau AMAP, les magasins biologique et sur place, au fournil. Notre volonté d'ouvrir notre lieu sur la culture (soirées concerts, théâtre, contes .....) nous amène à proposer notre boulangerie en accueil WWOOFing. Français, anglais, espagnol, allemand, portugais et néerlandais parlés.

We live on a small farm where we created our cooperative bakery with 3 persons (Emanuel, Mickael et Erik). We bake organic bread knead by hand and baked in a authentic wood oven. The bakery is situated in the countryside surrounded by fields and apple tree orchards. Our wish is to show and explain that with few investments one can make an organic bakery in countryside. That’s why as well we open the bakery to receive many groups of children for educational visits. We bake bread, pizza’s, pies with vegetables and fruits from our garden which we sell on local markets, in organic food shops, associations and at the farm.

true,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","&gt; The single parent that has to work to support their kid?

Nobody says from one day to another that they want to immigrate to country X (lets stay with the Netherlands). Start learning Dutch a year in advanced then you've got three years to get to B1 or A2 or whatever they want. That's more then enough even if you only have half an hour per day. A single mother or father probably has it easier because the child has an easier time picking up the language and can help her or him.

&gt; The dude that received a workplace injury and can't leave his place?

Call a class mate and ask him what they did so he can do his homework at home? Have you never missed a day in school?

&gt; There are so many countless numbers of exceptions you'd have to put in that the law would be subject to widespread systemic abuse.

Bad time management is not an excuse. So isn't bad planing. There don't have to be that many exceptions.

&gt; And the schools, are they state or private run?

At least in Germany, it's private, I think. 

&gt; If state, you're going to need many many more people to make up for the additional 1000x people needing to learn.

Get's the government employee working at least. It's not like there aren't people who are qualified to teach but unemployed. Maybe they even like teaching and fill gaps in the proper education system. Who knows.

&gt; If private, how can you ensure they have a decent curriculum.

Because it's the fucking Goethe-Institut, University of Cambridge, other highly prestigious institutions that do those classes and exams. 

&gt; This is a populist idea in the extreme.

It really isn't.

&gt; Look, I think people should learn the language of the country they move to.

So what's the problem?

&gt; I learnt Polish and Swedish as a result. 

See? Wasn't that hard, was it?

&gt; But I think that such a law is only there to appease xenophobes and nationalists, and I don't think it's practical to enforce such a law with any degree of justice or fairness.

Yes it is. Many countries already have this requirement for citizenship and nobody complains because it's common sense that you do not move to a country without trying to integrate and language is the best way.

&gt; Plus, it isn't based on any kind of evidence that it's a good idea. So why do it?

That is discrimination. Our cows have no lower quality, they are better since they have less antibiotics. Shouldn't that be rewarded? 

So, yes, we are forced to being discriminated, forced to lower our standards. Why should we stand for that? Why are you doing that to us btw? Why don't you care about higher standards? I do not want to be in a union with people who want low non environmental friendly standards. That however is what you vote for. We are, as always, outnumbered. 

And, we are nine million, no one gives a shit apart from you want our money. If you care, why are we still bring discriminated? 


Apart from research, some environmental issues and education- what stuff will the EU do better? Energy? No. Finances- please, you are loosing A ratings by the week. Unemployment- well we can all se how good that is going? Environment- clear no. So why should we put up with lower standards and discrimination?  If the EU wanted higher standards and not discriminate, then they should stop. However, they do not care. 

And, if the EU can't handle stuff, then leave. Stop the CAP then. 

Come on- Greece are not paying off their debt. They have already received a debt reduction. No one pays off 170%. You yourself admits it is hollow.  And that we will have to pay for them for ages. Why? Why does the EU do not react? why haven't they done anything- ever. You know my children will pay off Greece, possibly grandchildren. Why? I never signed up for that- why can't we stop? What makes the Greeks so unique that they deserve our tax money when they cheat and pay less? The EU do not care about that- they keep throwing good money after bad. 

And, the EU want more money, and obviously as we can see from CAP, structural funds and Southern Europe- they do not care about where they go. If they cared- why are the south in the situation they are in? And if the people in the south care- why do they vote the way they do? Why are they corrupt? 

No, nine million Swedes can't stop this, we are just bring bled for money and it will get worse, since the EU are not putting on any breaks (if they did, why are Greece still receiving money, please answer that)

I look at what people, countries and organisations do, and form my opinions after that. I am utterly unimpressed with the EU, and the people and countries of Southern Europe. Individually they can be lovely I am sure, but seriously, if you vote for Berlusconi for ten years, you do not want a future that is good. If you have received  money for 32 years and are in Greece position- is that improving? 

So, what does the EU care if we leave? According to you we pay nothing and the EU loves the environment anyway, and is improving by the hour. If it is so successful, why can't a few countries leave?

J'ai moi même à la faveur de mon congé maternité vu tous les épisodes de Kitchen Nightmares US et Cauchemar en cuisine Français.

Eh bien, la formation et le parcours des gens, leur précarité, les dettes, on les vois assez souvent évoquées. Je suis d'accord avec tous les autres aspects, et il est vrai que le coût de revient des plats est vraiment à peine évoqué (mais il l'est parfois), qu'on aimerait voir plus de cuisine que d'engueulades, et que le tout est très symbolique et larmoyant. Je plussoie tout à fait sur l'analyse liant ça à la rédemption religieuse et les idéaux américains.

Mais souvent le premier truc que les chefs demandent c'est combien ça rapporte, combien ça devrait rapporter, combien les gens ont emprunté, si leur maison est en hypothèque, etc. En tout cas dans la version US c'est un thème complètement central. Et les problèmes de conservation des denrées sont abordés aussi comme un problème budgétaire.

Les problèmes d'horaires sont aussi mentionnés quand l'éthique de travail du patron est en cause, mais presque uniquement quand il s'agit bien du patron, parce qu'en tant qu'entrepreneur il n'a pas l'air de s'engager assez par rapport aux autres, par exemple. La formation des chefs est également souvent abordée, par exemple lorsque le patron en demande trop à ses employés, ou lorsqu'un chef a des prétentions non justifiées par son niveau.

Granada is also incredible.  The Alhambra is one spot you cannot miss.  Granada especially is very walkable.  Cars cannot even enter some of the city.

Some smaller towns that I love are Ronda, Mijas, and Nerja (though Nerja is quite touristy).  One of our best meals in Spain happened when we walked a few blocks away from the beach in Nerja and asked a random woman what her favorite restaurant was.

Walking and taking taxis is the way to go in cities.  Renting a car is handy from driving between cities, but only recommended inside cities if you have a good GPS and are a confident driver.  If I went back, I would probably rely on public transportation.  The buses and trains are generally very reliable.

And if you are in southern Spain, you should make time for the beach.  There are incredible beaches all along the Mediterranean.  And don't forget Gibraltar!

&gt;What people don't get is that it's the youth that is slowly radicalized, and that there is a bastard culture emerging in the banlieue. In 1990, only 60% of muslims were doing Ramadan, now it's more than 85%. The old guard of Maghreb immigrants that came in 50, 60, 70 wasn't that religious. They wanted to escape poverty, and sometimes the violent islamism in their country (Algeria). They were moderate, or more precisely, as conservative as were the catholic of the times (and French catholics are quite conservative, see the gay rights history in France).

&gt;Hughes Lagrange, a french sociologist, found out that :

&gt;- Youths are more religious than their elders (which is atypic, when you think about church, you think old people). It's a wide gap : more than 40% of the young muslims go to the Mosque, while less than 20% of the 40 years old do.

&gt;- If a muslim came to France while adult, he is more likely to be less religious than a muslim under 16 either immigrating to France, or born here !

&gt;([source](http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2012/11/01/des-jeunes-fideles-a-l-islam_1784520_3246.html))

&gt;But the thing with those young muslims is that they are mostly French citizens, they're not immigrants. They live here and they aren't leaving.

&gt;The true reason behind the rise of Islam in the banlieues is the failure of the State to ""be there"" since more than 40 years now ( and I suppose the post 11 septembre world isn't helping). There is almost no public institutions in those districts, for instance, Clichy-sous-bois, where the 2005 riots started, has no unemployement agency. Despite a +40% unemployemnt in certain districts. I say that because we know from studying cities that crime is a disease, not a weakness of character. If you live in a district that has public services, including transportation, then crime will go down. So when those people feel abandoned, when they feel the public hate, they turn to Islam. And soon there is a sort of islamic pressure installing itself in those banlieues where you got to follow the ""rules"" or else.

True. Aversion is a strong word. I don't even think it's against anything that the UK does (great country imho). It's more related to the UK's EU policies which in my honest opinion are more than ridiculous. Maybe it's also this Cameron attitude of talking about the Commonwealth constantly even though it has as much relevance as the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth. ^^^just ^^^kidding ^^^;)


&gt;This is not a pro-EU sub. This is a European sub. There are Europeans that post frequently that are not from EU member states (Norwegians and Swiss). There are EUphiles and there are EUsceptics, from both UK and other Member States. If you only want to encounter EUphile views, this is not the right sub for you.

While that's true you can't deny the fact that this sub is incredibly popular in Europhile groups. It's a sub that is mostly based on the European Union. Whether it's somebody from Switzerland or Sweden it's still about Swedish relations to EU member states or something that regards other countries. But yes. Even eurosceptics frequent this sub however those are honestly a minority. Just the fact that a thread about the European dream was on of the top-threads yesterday is something that you wouldn't see in most European politics related forums. 


&gt;Technically, they made it optional after the age of 14. I think it is still required between 11 and 14. I think the current government are trying to make language learning compulsory until 16, which I think is a good idea because I think it is part of a wide education.

Yes it's optional once students reacht he age of 14. An incredibly stupid move by the former government which improved nothing. Instead it reduced knowledge of German and French by a lot since only a minority of students picked a modern language (instead of Greek/Latin).  A political move that somehow was rarely critizised back in 2004. 

&gt;The UK is pretty welcoming to immigrants and that we have had huge levels of immigration because of it.

Since there are obviously no statistics on immigrants in Britain I'll just assume that you are correct. I'm not saying that integration policies are bad in the UK, or let me rephrase it, worse than in other European countries however it's still far from perfect. For example the 2011 riots were also caused by socio-economical disparities which can be traced back to insufficient integration. Of course this happens everywhere. Italy, France, Germany etc. Still nowhere close to ""pretty welcoming"". Cameron is also known as conservative hardliner in Europe and absolutely not a tolerant immigrant loving and work creating politician.



&gt;[...] I think it depends partly how long you are going to a place and other factors too. I normally try and speak something in the native language, but I travel a great deal for work and sometimes just go to places for 24 hours and sometimes on very short notice. How many languages do you expect me to have to know? Also, it is not just anglophones who expect people to know English. Frequently I have come across, for instance, Dutch, Danes, Swedes, travelling in other countries who don't speak the language of that country and try and communicate with the locals in English.
I do agree though, that there is a way to be polite to people when you are in their country and this can be done either by trying to speak their language or alternatively by being grateful when they try and speak your language. But I am not sure that it is fair to say that Brits are less respectful than other people.

Completely agree. I absolutely didn't want to make it sound like Brits are foreigner hating pricks. This goes for every nationality. Whether it's somebody from France or Spain everybody should be respectful and accept that not everybody speaks English.
 
&gt;In my view, one of the problems that Brits have with foreign languages, in addition to not really needing them, is that even if we want to learn one we can't be sure which one to choose. I chose French and Italian at random, but I have always felt embarrassed that I don't know German.

True. I bet it's not easy to choose a language if you usually don't *need* it. However it should be every politicians duty to improve education and languages are an important asset. Whether it's French or German really doesn't matter in the end. Knowing a sencond languages improves your knowledge in different ways. For example with Italian you can read Italian newspapers and look at let's say British political discussion from a different angle. Completely ignoring sencond languages isn't the solution though. When I went to school we had to learn a total of 2-3 languages. Even though this differs from school to school a 3rd language besides German and English is usually compulsory. I took French but Spanish or Russian were also available.


&gt; [...] The French people complained (jokingly) that it wasn't fair that we were speaking English, as there were four of them and only two of us and we were in Paris. But if you think about it, this situation could occur anywhere. My British friend wasn't being rude - he did speak German fluently and was only in Paris for the weekend.

That's totally ok. If somebody really doesn't know the language that's not a problem. However if you demand to speak in English that's a problem in my opinion. And I think that an educational system that favor 1-language-education this is kind of the subliminal message. But yeah, I'm not saying that this is the problem of Brits because I know that people from the UK don't think like that. It's just something that I don't like about the British governments.  But who am I to judge we have our own problems.  Again I really didn't want to start a rant about how ""evil"" people from Britain are. Sorry if it sounded like that. I was just somewhat thrown off from your assumption that this sub hates anglo-phones. I can't speak for others but I personally love Britain.

 If there is one element of Islam that has proven to be truly incompatible with European culture, it is Arabic interpretation of what Islam is and because Arabs ""found"" Islam, they have a lot of say in the Muslim world. Now that they also have a lot of power thanks to oil and natural gas, they have the ability to directly influence other Muslim people across the world once again.  


Our two civilizations have clashed numerous times throughout the centuries and it has always been pretty violent. Now, I don't want to suggest that we are the good guys and they are evil or vice versa, but I think that at our cores, we are mirror images of each other. I think that we basically like too many different things to be ""living in the same house"" and if we want to be all happy we should stay away from each other. 

I have painted a very black and white picture, but the reality is much more grey and if an element from one side wants to cross to the other we really don't have the right to stop it. We should, however, make sure that people are aware of what is expected of them. If both parties try to accommodate each other, I think that we should be able get along just fine and prove the Doomsday scenarios wrong.

I will talk about the case of Spain, and I will try to be objective. If after reading this you aren't sure which side I support, then I succeeded, if you are, then I am sorry.

One thing you have to understand is that bullfighting is a national symbol in Spain, at least for some people, specially the conservatives and some people aligned with the centre and even centre-left (one important thing is that there's no division among the economic classes, as a difference with fox hunt). It is also heavily politicized. Nationalists -Basque, Catalonians- dislike it as it's a symbol of Spain. For example, bullfighting is forbidden in Catalonia which Spanish nationalists considered an attack on Spain itself resulting in an increased support on bullfighting (other ""games"" with bulls, that are only practised in Catalonia weren't forbidden). 

People that work in the area -bullfighters, farmers- and the people really onto it will argue that it is a tradition, the bulls are raised to die, that a specific race of bulls would disappear, that the bullfighter might also die and that it may be considered an art (Hemingway tends to be mentioned).

And yes, there's a lot of people against it, some take action to prevent bullfighting and others think that it will slowly disappear in a process similar to religion: the supporters would end up dying. Their main point is that torturing, hurting or killing an animal for fun is not human.

One last note: there are many bull ""games"" some are even worse than bullfighting, in others the bull is not wounded at all.

true,marmulak,HUNG,Tajikistan,"To be honest, any person who has a religion is going to say that their religious beliefs are more important than the secular laws of their country. However, we must not forget the fact that generally secular laws and religious rules coexist quite easily, and that Islamic tradition has a strongly supportive stance of upholding the rule of law. It's a core tenet of Muslim faith to abide by the laws of the country in which you live.

Ask any Christian point blank, ""Is what Jesus says more important, or what your government says?"" If they answer ""Jesus"" to this question, what do we do? Paint them as anti-establishment radicals? This has in fact happened in the past, such as in the case of the now exonerated Martin Luther King, Jr., who used his religious beliefs to politically oppose policies in his own country.

It should come as no surprise then that if you ask a Muslim whether their religion or their government is more important, they'll say their religion. That doesn't automatically make them extreme nut jobs.

As for homophobia and anti-Semitism, the homophobia can be explained by the fact that it's human nature to reject homosexuality. The majority of human beings dislike it to some degree, and there are many cases of popular opposition to laws promoting homosexuality in Western culture (as the survey points out that such attitudes are similarly held by Christians). The notion that Islam is somehow unique or ushering some kind of foreign influence is nonsensical here. As for the anti-Semitism, it is unfortunate but not surprising given the fact that Israel does everything it does under the banner of ""Judaism."" Asking Muslims how they feel about Jews is like asking Americans how they feel about Japanese right after Pearl Harbor. You will undoubtedly encounter negative views, even though they are not justified.

So really, there is nothing particularly special or shocking here.

I'm commuting, so that is out of an option. If I travell long distance, which I do quite often, the routes I take often have one train an hour, so you have to make you're connecting train. I take the S-Bahn von Kleinevorstadt to Mannheim and I have 7 minutes to change. Let the train have 5 minutes and you missed that. The main problem I have, that I use a wheel chair, and the mobility service can be quite a bitch too. They often fail if you have missed you're train because of delays and if you take a train without booking the mobility service in advance, it's just a game based on luck if everything goes alright. I often have to take massive help from my fellow passengers, which is nice that they help, but it's shocking that the DB doesn't have the personal to help you.

Also travelling over night, which I also like to do, means no mobility service at all.

&gt; The other option would be to just add 10 minutes to every train and then leisurely drive the last km at 5 km/h.

They do that already to most horrible trains out there. Some long distance trains have regular stops like in Mannheim standing there for 10 minutes or more. It's to make up time and make sure to get delayed trains still can make their connecting train. Alltough that only works if you take another long distance train.

Mostly short distance trains get fucked over by delayed long distance trains, because they often let them take over.

true,Mouthful_of_Grandpa,GNLD,Greenland,"&gt;The Six Country Immigrant Integration Comparative Survey collected data in more than 9,000 telephone interviews in Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium and Sweden. The respondents were **Turkish and Moroccan immigrants**, as well as control groups of natives. This study is the first that allows analysis on an empirical base of the extent and impact of religious fundamentalism.


This makes the study all that much scarier. Turkish and Moroccan Muslims are generally less fundamentalist than many of their other counterparts. ",0,1386744915,null,0,false,0,cdyz6os,t3_1sl28r,t1_cdyz6os,t3_1sl28r,null,1428274091,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17

&gt;In this book, Steyn argues that ""much of what we loosely call the Western world will not survive the twenty-first century, and much of it will effectively disappear within our lifetimes, including many if not most European countries.""[2] The declining populations in European countries coupled with both the increasingly high birth rates of Muslim countries and the increased Muslim immigration into European nations will, according to Steyn, lead to the end of modern European culture.

Meanwhile by 2050 over a third of the US will be hispanic and blacks will be the majority demographic. 

No offence but that book sounds like some redneck motherfucker who doesn't appear to be aware that even ""multi cultural"" countries like the UK are still 91 percent ethnically white british whilst the US is only 60 percent

So not only is he a fear mongering racist he's also wrong. The biggest upheaval of culture in the 21st Century will appear in North America not Europe. And even then it won't be a particularly bad cultural upheaval for N.America - it'll just be more south american influenced.
