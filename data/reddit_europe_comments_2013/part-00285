Ask around, ask your neighbours, ask at the newsstand around the corner, ask German co-workers. Google your doctor, read reviews (requires knowledge of the German language).
When talking to a German doctor, talk in simple words, easy sentence structure. Also describe the symptoms as detailed as you can. Make a list:
- Where is your pain (point at it, show)? How bad is the pain? How does the pain feel(stabbing, pounding,..)? When did it start? 
- Have you used any medication (how often, how long)?
- Have you been sleeping well?

Etc.

German doctors are listeners. YOU need to give them as much information as you can. If you just say: 'I've had a fever for the last 2 days', they will send you home with a paracetamol. If you say, ""I've had a fever of 39 degrees for the last 2 days, a slimy cough, no sleep, and a very bad headache. I have a stabbing pain in my chest."" You are much more likely for further examination. Don't interpret or diagnose yourself, just present the facts. (Facts are important in German culture).

Detailed, initial information is key when visiting a German doctor. 
When I saw my doctor today, she just asked ""What can I do for you?"" I described my symptoms as detailed as possible and walked out with another appointment for further examination for this week and a prescription.

I spoke with one Greek about this whole mess and he said that Greece has always been an unjust society where rules don't apply to the people at the top or the ones who can make the rules. But that is anecdotal of course.

What I want is for this somewhat xenophobic bullshit to end. ""Germany gave the Greeks all that free money and they thank us by shooting at our ambassador's house!"" - that's the line of thinking that breeds terrible problems in the future.

That alone would have been a good reason not to vote for her if I hadn't had enough already. (I do understand where she's coming from, though.) If I had to write down all my thoughts on this each time I'd have to write a book. I'm just getting really frustrated by how Germany seems to get all the blame.

&gt;  Countries are not households! You're treating this as if it was a household debt. 

I don't. I was referring to the interest payments on top of the primary deficit, those that Greece would have avoided through a full default (""existing debt would magically disappear""), and I understand very well that government debt is fine as long as the interest payments stay below economic growth.  
That's why I was specifically referring to the primary deficit, because that's what Greece's problem would have been without the bailouts and without ordinary private lending that had already disappeared at this point. That money just wouldn't have been there to make any payments.

&gt; YOU CAN'T HAVE A MONETARY UNION WITHOUT FUCKING FISCAL TRANSFERS. 

Yup, and I keep saying this. We knew this from the start of the Eurozone, and we were *supposed to* work on this after the introduction, but for similar reasons as why I believe the Greek government wouldn't have reformed on its own, we never quite got around to fixing those issued that should have been solved before we introduced the euro in the first place.  
We don't only need a mechanism for financial transfers, though, as if those wouldn't be politically difficult as it is (even within Germany they're difficult, and this will become very visible within this legislative period, because both the regular and the Reunification related mechanisms we have are up for renewal, respectively about to end, at the end of this decade). To have such a mechanism, we also need a proper one to control national budgets, and for that to be viable and on an appropriate democratic footing, we need closer political integration with significantly more power (and budget) in the hands of the European Parliament. In short, we need to federalise, but I've lost the hope I had initially had that this crisis would be used to get there. Now it seems we'll just wiggle through it somehow, keep on procrastinating, and eventually end up again right where we are today because nothing along those lines will get done.

That's one thing I would have liked to see happening. For the short term, I would have liked an EU-controlled (as opposed to going through the Greek government) mechanism to provide money for investments in Greek infrastructure (beyond the normal funds) as a stimulus and direct credit to Greek companies to protect the healthy parts of the economy from unnecessarily going bankrupt due to dried up credit.  
Yeah, I'd have also changed some of the terms, but I don't think it would have been politically feasible. Not in Germany, and not in many of the other countries that don't even seem to exist in this discussion at all, despite election results that show how their population isn't exactly supportive of those bailouts, either. And yes, I know that those figures are relatively small, be it relative to the size of the crisis or even relative to what we still pay in Reunification related costs (close to €100bn/year).  
I've even said that the ECB should aim for moderately higher inflation (as is they don't even meet their 2% target), but the ECB was set up to be as independent from political interference as possible (for reasons I happen to agree with).

This isn't economics, but politics. Politics is also the reason why all those countries got a similar deal, despite some very different underlying causes for their problems. If you take politics out of the equation, this makes absolutely no sense.

&gt; Germany beggared its neighbours by cheating and having an artificially lower inflation target than it should have. 

Germany had, and still has, one of the highest labour costs in the world. [In manufacturing](http://www.bls.gov/fls/chartbook/2012/section3a.htm#chart3.1), it's about 50% more than the UK's. It's higher than in France or the Netherlands, for example, and those aren't exactly economically underdeveloped countries known for exploiting their workers. When we enacted those reforms, and labour unions agreed to wage restraint, Germany was the ""sick man of Europe"" and everybody was saying how we needed to do those things, or else. Of course this meant a relative loss of competitiveness for the rest of the Eurozone (because regaining competitiveness was the whole point), but it's not as if wages there had stuck to growing in line with inflation and productivity increase (except for France, they're the odd ones out here who neither de- nor inflated their wages relative to inflation).

&gt; That's just an unsubstantiated claim. For all we know, defaulting right away and exiting the Eurozone might have been better in the long term.

I happen to be convinced we're very lucky we don't know for sure that it wouldn't have, but we're just going to have to disagree here. The way I see it, it would have made the crisis *much* worse for the Eurozone, and Greece might well have ended up as a failed state. Greece had this option, and still has it now more than ever with a (pre-exit) balanced primary budget, but there are some very good reasons why the current way seemed preferable to the government.  
Greece took the deal because the alternative would have been worse, and the rest of the Eurozone offered it for the same reason. There's a set of politically feasible approaches, and there's a set of economically sensible approaches, but they don't overlap. There's also the necessity of a federation with closer political and budgetary integration (yes, including transfers), but you know how the odds for this happening are as well as I do.

You're just exagerrating. I was obviously not talking about supressive measures, I was talking about *culture* and what is *respected* and considered good. I didn't say a single word about state and laws, that has other implications. So you were just agitating by intentionally misinterpreting my words into some kind of pro-dictatorship declaration. Talk about manipulating. Either way, it doesn't matter. Why the fuck are you fixated on *the way* the argument is presented and not the argument? Should I insult you again and say something along the lines of ""you just have nothing substantial to add"" so that you would talk about the actual subject? Just fucking get over it and talk about the actual argument.

&gt;No need to be condecending, and you are advocating that the state promotes a single ideology, states that promote a single ideology tend to resemble the ones that I mentioned.

Once again, not a word about the state, it was all about culture. Since when does the state control culture? If anything, I'd advocate a very serious attitude towards education in history and biology, especially in what concerns evolution. Apart from that, I don't know what the state can do - it's all about what we do and our attitude.

March 1963 in Frankenfeld's show: ""Guten Abend, Peter Frankenfeld"", followed by a theatre production in a Hamburg theatre on 8. July 1963.   It was neither intended as a New Year's Eve programme nor was the success anticipated. It was rather used as a filler by ARD (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland / *consortium of german public broadcasters* ) and NDR (Norddeutscher Rundfunk / *north german broadcasting* ) for 9 years. Only after those 9 years did it get a fixed spot: Henrie Regnier, the NDR entertainment director got the filmreel from the archives and decided to air it on the 31.12.1972. Since then it's had its firm place in all public broadcasting programmes (other than ARD and ZDF).  
Unfortunately I couldn't find anything about why this sketch in particular is so well liked. One would have to analyse German humour for this... Possibly it is the slightly physical side to it (tripping over the tiger's head, his ankle hurting, when he has to click his heels for Admiral von Schneider, the partially bawdy ring to it...) This physical side can also be seen in the German's liking of Rowan Atkinson's ""Mr. Bean"".

That is not all: why, out of those four, is Germany the most trustworthy? Why France or Germany more arrogant? For those four, the clichés touched apply pretty well. German stereotypes are reliability and frugality, fitting very well with later being named least compassionate and most trustworthy.

true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"No, I don't mean the fractional reserve requirement. That is how much money a bank must deposit from its customers and relates to the creation of deposit money (""Giralgeldschöpfung""). [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_base) is what I was talking about.

So, when a central lends out 1000€ and demands 1100€ back, it does so knowing that the economy will grow by about 10% and that the private banks will be able to deposit collateral of the same amount in the form of mortgages, stocks, bonds to obtain the necessary amount of money to roll over the old obligations. The ""interest on interest"" (compound interest) is a rather academic and mathematical fact. Have you not taken a loan, ever? Because then you should know that you have to pay back a fixed amount of principal and interest at fixed intervals till you have everything paid back – there is no compound interest unless you fail to make your payments on time. And then, in most cases, you're probably going to default soon afterwards, which means the creditor gets back *nothing at all*. I know there are these stories of someone depositing a tiny amount of money a looong time ago and then showing how much he would have accrued at even tiny amounts of interest, which is then supposed to show the un-sustainability of the system. They are missing the fact that, if you take into account defaults and not missing your payments, the effective interest is significantly lower than what might be written in today's average loan contracts.

As for the video, these people are outsiders in their own field voicing nonsense. A single bank *itself* cannot lend out money by doing a balance sheet extension. That only happens when multiple banks are part of such a lending-depositing-chain. That, too, is taught in school, you know. I really don't see how people can claim that, seeing as how just in the recent years banks failed because too many of their debtors defaulted. And before that happened, we actually had [nations like Spain](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/government-debt-to-gdp) who were reducing their debt (but unfortunately not making sure that private debt didn't explode, so yeah…). So it's another video with some ""academic"" who spouts an obscure minority opinion. They exist everywhere; hell, there's a physics professor a few buildings over from mine who rejects relativity. And that's in a natural science field, where we have experiments that have so far famously failed to disprove the theory of relativity.

If you want to engage someone in debate then there is a correct way to do it. Your arguments must be clearly formed and free from logical fallacies.

Au moins, je me dis que ça a une fonction sociale et que ça fait réfléchir les gens plutôt que de les endormir devant des feuilletons télé à rallonge. Dans un pays à culture chrétienne, effacer la connaissance de la culture religieuse à dessein, c'est couper les gens de leur propre culture. 

Si ces émissions avaient une dimension historique et culturelle, ça irait encore, mais de ce que j’en ai vu, ce n’est pas le cas.

Normally when one ideology is promoted over another on a wide scale (again, you failed to specify how wide so I assume you mean to everyone) it is by the state, but I'd like to hear how you would promote atheism on such a wide scale without infringing on people's right to their original culture and religion.

By social discouragement and by education. What I'm trying to do is simply cause social disrespect for irrationality, all with just me talking and hoping that other people will do the same. There are organizations that promote it their own ways, you can look into Richard Dawkins' books and organizations for example, he's big on Atheism and its acceptance, though he's mainly concerned, as am I, with faith, not religion per se.

&gt;Why do you assume that every single religious person denies science? The vast majority of theists completely agree with that point. Only a fool would deny evolution and very few theists do.

[Quote needed, buddy].

The last survey I read was from 2005 and only about 12% of Americans accepted the theory of evolution as it is. 51% dismissed it altogether and about 40% believed it was guided by god. It leaves a very small percentage of people that do not deny evolution, so your claim is completely wrong. I do not have the link to the study right now, I can look it up tommorow. That's the situation in the US, but evolution isn't much acknowledged anywhere, look it up as well.

There have also been around 50 studies on the correlation between education+intelligence and religious belief, the relation is inversely proportional. That's what makes me think that if people were taught evolution and sciences well, and they actually understood evolution and scientific method, there would be a lot less irrationality and religiousness in our society. But then again, where are you going to find in America a teacher that can teach it well, when almost 90% deny evolution? Also, with how many religious schools you have in the UK, I wouldn't hope for too much there either.

How should I put this? I don't know if god doesn't exist, it's just that nothing tells me he does. On the reverse, with certain religions, many things tell me that he doesn't. In fact, laws of physics tell me that he doesn't. So what do I do, pray to him? Sounds pretty stupid to me.

Yes, it is stupid to believe and lose your time on things that show no signs of existence. Yes it is stupid to devote your life to the spaghetti monster. If you don't think this is stupid, then you're just lost in your complex system of thinking which doesn't account for the simple fact that yeah, we may not know for sure, but we make a decision or another based on the knowledge that we have, and one of them is more reasonable than the other.

true,itz4mna,UKGB,United Kingdom - England,"&gt;The last survey I read was from 2005 and only about 12% of Americans accepted the theory of evolution as it is. 51% dismissed it altogether and about 40% believed it was guided by god. It leaves a very small percentage of people that do not deny evolution, so your claim is completely wrong. I do not have the link to the study right now, I can look it up tommorow. That's the situation in the US, but evolution isn't much acknowledged anywhere, look it up as well.

America != the world and Christianity accounts only for 32% of the world's religions. While I did make the mistake of making a claim I can't back up, I don't think this is satisfactory evidence either.

&gt;There have also been around 50 studies on the correlation between education+intelligence and religious belief, the relation is inversely proportional. That's what makes me think that if people were taught evolution and sciences well, and they actually understood evolution and scientific method, there would be a lot less irrationality and religiousness in our society. But then again, where are you going to find in America a teacher that can teach it well, when almost 90% deny evolution? Also, with how many religious schools you have in the UK, I wouldn't hope for too much there either. Hopefully at least the cynism will get you out of this simple delusion.

Why do you keep assuming I am a Christian? Christianity has an influnce on my culture but my philosophical position is very different from the one you're attacking.

Did you read my previous argument at all? Silly strawmen like your unicorns and spaghetti monsters aside (you describe physical beings, God is generally conceived as non-material), we as humans simply do not have the capacity to claim that things we cannot see do not exist, our perception isn't remotely developed enough for that.

true,flocosix,MOLD,Moldova,"&gt;Why do you keep assuming I am a Christian? Christianity has an influnce on my culture but my philosophical position is very different from the one you're attacking. Anecdotally, proponents of atheism love to bash Christianity but I'm yet to hear quarter of the hate you pour at a harmless religion aimed at Islam, a religion with far more recent blood on it's hands.

By ""you"" I meant ""you guys from the UK"", sorry for the confusion. I'm picking on Christianity because I'm familiar with it, I don't care about it specifically, I just want a society where *no* religion influences anyone's actions.

About the co-existence of acceptance of evolution and religiousness, well, look at this:

1) http://ncse.com/news/2011/04/polling-creationism-evolution-around-world-006634

Let's take Sweden, as it has the highest acceptance of evolution from the surveyed countries. 68%.

Now, let's look at the percentage of religious people in Sweden:

According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010,[3]

* 18% of Swedish citizens responded that ""they believe there is a god"".

* 45% answered that ""they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force"".

* 34% answered that ""they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force"".

What we've got here is 34% Atheism, 45% undefined faith and 18% religion. I think the correlation is pretty obvious between high acceptance of evolution and low religiousness.

The same correlation is present in the countries with high percentage of belief in creationism, obviously.

Look, in the end, it doesn't matter, we already have the studies that show the inversely proportional relation between education/intelligence and religiousness. It's all you need in order to promote education as a mean for reducing religiousness.",0,1388436848,null,0,false,0,cedl2zt,t3_1u083s,t1_cedl2zt,t1_cedknog,null,1427927709,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

High office? That's not *exactly* what I said, is it? Obviously there are any number of those, from France to Italy (Arab justice and African integration minister respectively). 

President/Prime Minister is another matter, one that requires popular support. 

It seems to me that you're extrapolating and applying what's a reality in Britain to all of Europe. I'm sorry, but the reality is that we are not as multi-cultural as you are.

&gt;Second gens generally stand just as much chance of making the cut as a full blooded native, assuming they have the resources and the influence to do so.

Oh, absolutely, that's usually the case no matter which culture you come from or go to. High office is absolutely achievable; on merits or as appointments.

Still, Norway is not similar to the UK, and the same goes for a lot of countries around Europe. I doubt we will ever have a Pakistani-Norwegian PM, or a Turkish-ethnic Chancellor of Germany.

true,flocosix,MOLD,Moldova,"&gt;Since your such a fan of Sweden why not have a look at this? Rape reports in Europe This shows that Sweden is the rape capital of Europe. Does atheism cause rape? Of course not, and for a man of science you completely fail to understand that correlation does not equal causation

Okay, good point, I'm working off of some assumptions, but it seems pretty obvious that if you give a man a solid scientific explanation of the human's origin, plus a background in physics in chemistry, he will be a lot less likely to fall for the creationist bullshit, for example. Isn't it logical? You give him something that can be proven against something that can't. Makes sense that he'd end up either an Atheist or a man of undefined faith, like most people in Sweden. 
 
Now, you can reap all the benefits of having a more rational society, which, it is safe to assume, wouldn't care much about homosexuality, for example. 

Some things are caused by faith and irrationality, some by (let's assume) emotional trauma. They are different things. I'm working on the former, which is mostly a direct product of religiousness and the promotion of wrong, irrational values and worldviews, I think we can agree on that. The problem here is Christianity. But the deeper problem is that people ever let themselves be influenced by something as ludicrous as a doctrine based on a fantasy character. The religion doesn't matter, it's the people's fault that they are stupid enough to fall for it.

&gt;And anyway, what affect on society does the non-belief in evolution have? Those who it is relevent to know it is fact. Those who aren't biologists who claim otherwise are rightly laughed at and have precisely zero affect on the field of biology, and your life.

Those who don't have a good chance of falling into the irrational crowd, especially with the help of religion -- but that's just one of the ways. People need a solid scientific thinking ingrained into them starting from school. They need to be taught to rely on reason, not on faith, when solving social issues such as homophobia and hatred of non-virginity. That would help, I hope completely, to completely avoid those issues, and that's the whole point of it for me.",0,1388439337,null,0,false,0,cedm6rz,t3_1u083s,t1_cedm6rz,t1_cedllgk,null,1427927178,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; I don't see your point, most Romanian jews like jews from all over eastern Europe emigrated to Israel.

120k/150k Jews in Transylvania killed by Hungarian fascists; Half of the estimated 270,000 to 320,000 Jews living in Bessarabia, Bukovina, and the former Dorohoi County in Romania were murdered between June 1941 and the spring of 1944. After a wave of random initial killings, Jews in Moldavia were subject to pogroms, while those in Bessarabia, Bukovina and Dorohoi were concentrated into ghettos from which they were deported to concentration camps in the Transnistria Governorate, including camps built and run by Romanians. Romanian soldiers also worked with the German Einsatzkommando to massacre Jews in conquered territories east of the Romania's 1940 border. The total number of deaths is not certain, but even the lowest respectable estimates run to about 250,000 Jews (plus 25,000 deported Romani, of which half perished).

true,itz4mna,UKGB,United Kingdom - England,"&gt;Okay, good point, I'm working off of some assumptions, but it seems pretty obvious that if you give a man a solid scientific explanation of the human's origin, plus a background in physics in chemistry, he will be a lot less likely to fall for the creationist bullshit, for example. Isn't it logical? You give him something that can be proven against something that can't. Makes sense that he'd end up either an Atheist or a man of undefined faith, like most people in Sweden. 

I can accept that this is probably the case, and that it is certainly irrational to believe in a literal interpretation of the Biblical creation myth. Young-Earth creationism is a foolish thing to believe when what scientific knowledge we do have shows us it is completely false. 

&gt;Now, you can reap all the benefits of having a more rational society, which, it is safe to assume, wouldn't care much about homosexuality, for example. 

While I agree in part, I oppose gay adoption and much of the EU's tolerance law for completely secular reasons, I'm happy to have that debate as well but I don't think it is relevent to the current discussion.

&gt;Those who don't have a good chance of falling into the irrational crowd, especially with the help of religion -- but that's just one of the ways. People need a solid scientific thinking ingrained into them starting from school. They need to be taught to rely on reason, not on faith, when solving social issues such as homophobia and hatred of non-virginity. That would help, I hope completely, to completely avoid those issues, and that's the whole point of it for me.

I agree that certain forms of religion do cause these social problems but I think your solution of complete secularisation throws the baby out with the bathwater. We can work to neutralise the negative effect of religion without attacking it completely. A solid scientific education including the fundementals of logic and mathematics would go a long way towards this. Religion has the positive aspects of providing a common community that is (in the UK at least) apolitical and free of the pressures of social class and drama. In a church, every man is equal before God and secular alternatives fail to provide a suitable surrogate for this, it's been a while since I read Dawkins but I believe he recognised this.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"I must have imagined the debt crisis currently causing global turmoil to have originated in Europe. Despite popular opinion on reddit, [five of the top 10 largest banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks) are European. I took a class on international banking and finance regulation, and European banks managed to carve out one of the most favorable regulatory climates in the developed world. 

Mandatory disclosure requirements are far more strict under the SEC than the pan-European one-passport system. European companies just structure their securities offerings around these regulations so they effectively have to disclose very little. The original proposal was far more strict, but your native England lobbied until it was watered down enough for London to continue to be the global destination for questionable securities dealings and loans. Most international banks do their questionable lending out of their London offices. If you want a third party opinion on the matter, Japan allows SEC registrations to be dual-registered in Tokyo, whereas it does not extend the same courtesy to European registrations because they dont believe disclosure requirements are strict enough.

Go ask BNP, Deutsche, Barclay's, Agricole, HSBC, and many others how much international taxpayer money they have received in the form of debt payments from peripheral countries. These are the same banks the US Federal Reserve lent, what was on aggregate, likely [trillions of dollars](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-28/euro-crisis-makes-fed-lender-of-only-resort-as-banks-chase-dollar-funding.html) in short term essentially zero interest loans because they were so poorly capitalized. The countries with the [highest financial sector debt](http://www.gfmag.com/tools/global-database/economic-data/11855-total-debt-to-gdp.html#axzz2ozvDL5Tn) are in the EU, and all it takes is another crisis for this to start causing strain on institutions that have been allowed to get incredibly massive. 

France's two largest banks each have assets roughly equal to the entire economy of France. They are only getting larger with EU rules allowing for cross border mergers and acquisitions. So any bank registered in an EU country can do business in any EU country. Because of this 62% of bank mergers and acquisitions have taken place in the EU, not in Asia or a developing market where you might think. French banks' exposure to questionable debt, is one of the reasons France lost their AAA credit rating. Luckily billions of Euros in German taxpayer money is being filtered through Spain, Greece, et. al. to French banks to keep their assets from becoming non-performing. 

**TL;DR: Dont pat yourself on the back too much. European companies are just as good at setting themselves up for failure as US companies, some are even blazing new trails. You can especially thank the UK for weakening financial sector regulations throughout Europe almost guaranteeing taxpayers will be on the hook again come the next crisis.**",0,1388441705,null,0,false,0,cedn8ny,t3_1txvl1,t1_cedn8ny,t1_cedb79g,null,1427926687,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

The economy is already collapsing.

&gt;  Can't this independence be somehow negotiated in a framework similar to that of the UKs? Why the radicalism?

The Spanish government doesn't want to negotiate. It *started* with small things like the Catalan bullfighting banning, trying to replace replace Catalan language as vehicular language in Catalonia, Basque Country has fiscal privileges and Catalonia can't get those, Madrid is being privileged in investments by the central government. And the actitude of the Spanish government hasn't been the best. *Fucking Catalan people always crying even if their region is richer than average.* You may know how it can be. 

The Catalan reasons for the independence aren't pure, of course. The lack of fiscal privileges reason, they don't want participate in the solidarity system.

**The important bit.** The current Catalan included in his program for his first period getting the same fiscal privileges that the Basque country has, and the Spanish government rejected to negotiate with him in a sort of humiliating way. And Artur Mas(the Catalan President) and his supporting media transformed that in an attack of Spain to Catalonia. And it worked. The independence became even more popular and went over 50% in the polls and after a massive pro-independence demostration in the National Day of Catalonia(2012-09-11) he anounced that he will seek the independence.

Artur Más is probably the most capable politician in Spain, but he has lost control of the situation. He is a center-right liberal without any solid political principle other than some Catalanism. And at this moment he is losing in the polls to the independentist left that promised that they will declare independence unilaterally even if that means being out of the EU and not being recognized by the UN. The Catalan situation is radicalized and Spain has a Spanish nationalist conservative party founded by former high officers of the dictatorship.

There are many verifiable aspects to this, and a few speculation. Racial profiling is pretty much a given (repeatedly verified by journalists taking a stroll in the cité and by LICRA and other anti-racism groups). If you read Maitre Eolas you will also learn how ""garde à vue"" is used to detain suspects (without a lawyer present, as was legal for many years) as a punitive measure when the police believes the prosecution stands no chance but still want to act on something they suspect, yet cannot prove. Also there have been quite a few rumors of quotas, which I have never found out if they were true or not. So at least quite a few aspects of the supposed police harassment are believable. You can debate the usefulness of such interventions and attitudes. Some say it's simple survival and the cops doing their jobs, others say it's completely antagonizing and pragmatically stupid and unlikely to yield results.

Now for speculation, it has been suggested that since so many in the suburbs are unemployed, one big source of income has to be illegal activities. Therefore simply by enforcing the law the police would impoverish the inhabitants, which is why many rally against them.

I think it's a bit of both. The police try to do their job and are certainly less than diplomatic about it, brutality and harassment happen enough to make people distrust them while they're globally still too inefficient to keep the peace and the gangs down. People feel in turn abandoned and unfairly targeted. So when two young people died, it was a huge deal.

no






Ok scherzo. Il matrimonio e' stato dichiarato nullo dalla Sacra Rota secondo il diritto canonico. Ci sono varie fattispecie (dalla cosciente volonta' di non avere figli, al mancato 'consumo', simulazione di fede, etc.).

Molte di queste non sono causa di annullamento per un matrimonio civile, alcune (come per esempio la libera volonta' degli sposi) sono comuni ad entrambi i diritti.

Tuttavia la legge italiana riconosce la dipendenza del matrimonio civile da quello religioso (nel caso del matrimonio cattolico) e la nullita' del secondo rende nullo anche il primo (previa sentenza della Cassazione che si limita a verificare  una serie di condizioni (dal diritto alla difesa di entrambe le parti a un certo numero di criteri a cazzo che cambiano negli anni).

Reso nullo il matrimonio ne sono resi nulli retroattivamente anche gli effetti. E la cara mogliettina si puo' attaccare al cazzo per quanto riguarda gli alimenti.

Con due condizioni importanti: uno dei due e' cittadino italiano, il matrimonio e' in regola secondo le condizioni di 'matrimoniabilita' italiane. (Cioe' se l'Uzbekistan annulla il matrimonio perche' la sposa era vestita di rosso, ciccia no, in Italia e' ancora valido).

Non lo sostengo io, lo dice la legge, lo trovi spiegato tra le righe qui: http://www.diritto.it/docs/28026-il-riconoscimento-in-italia-del-matrimonio-celebrato-all-estero?page=2

&gt; la validità sostanziale del matrimonio contratto da cittadino italiano all’estero (nell’osservanza delle forme ivi previste) può essere negata solo previo esperimento dell’azione di nullità o annullamento di cui all’art 117 c.c.;

Piu' sotto:

&gt;Secondo l’opinione prevalente l’art 115 non impedisce l’applicazione dell’art 28  della Legge di Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato il quale prevede tre criteri alternativi e concorrenti al fine di stabilire la validità di un atto di matrimonio celebrato innanzi all’autorità locale agli effetti dell’ordinamento giuridico italiano. “Il matrimonio è valido, quanto alla forma, se è considerato tale dalla legge del luogo di celebrazione **o dalla legge nazionale di almeno uno dei due coniugi al momento della celebrazione** o dalla legge dello Stato di comune residenza in tale momento “.Non è dunque necessaria la compresente osservanza dei tre criteri, la semplice esistenza di uno essendo sufficiente a configurare un atto di matrimonio perfettamente valido ai sensi e per gli effetti della legge italiana.

&gt;We had one hyperinflation in 1923. We don't need another one, thank you very much.

Well then our goal should be to keep everyone as miserable as possible. Because that's what's really hampering inflation throughout the Eurozone, including Germany. People don't want to spend their money because they're in debt or don't have enough so there is no demand to drive prices up significantly.

1923 was bad but somehow Germany developed such a complex over it that we forgot what 1929 was like. Or we just don't care when mass unemployment hits our friends, which is more likely I think and worse.

Je ne nie pas ton droit à la liberté d'expression mais cela n'empêche en rien d'exercer ta liberté de penser, au sens cartésien au lieu de ressortir la doxa médiatique qui voudrait que Dieudonné, ou Soral tiennent des propos nauséabonds, qui donnent donc de fait envie de vomir. Sérieux ? Envie de vomir ? En ayant envie de vomir ou en osant espérer qu'il déconne vraiment, tu te décridibilises car il faut imaginer Dieudonné, un français (sous-peuple) noir (sous-race) avoir envie de ramener à la vie Hitler un suprématiste blanc Allemand avec une volonté d'expansion du territoire germanique et ses chambres à gaz, dont je pense il te viendrait jamais à l'esprit de considérer qu'elles n'aient peut-être jamais existé sans avoir jamais fait aucune recherche historique ou regarder le travail de ceux qui l'ont fait, pour y faire mourir Patrick Cohen. Essaie de te l'imaginer et tu te rendras compte qu'affirmer ici être offusqué tient plus d'une position de principe qu'à autre chose. Mais je ne t'en veux pas, c'est de l'ordre de la peur inconsciente d'être marqué ""antisémite"", ça peut l'être flippant. Récemment, j'ai reçu un petit mail du site de Dieudonné me disant que mes coordonnées avaient été piratées de leur site :)

Pour Auschwitz, rien à foutre très honnêtement d'un point de vue sentimentale, je ne suis pas adepte de cette religion d'Etat dont cette destination semble être un des lieux de pélerinages. Historiquement très intéressé par contre, surtout sur le débat sur le nombre réel de victimes dans ces camps de la mort (ou de concentration) qui ne peut avoir lieu en France et dans une demi-douzaine d'autre pays à cause de lois iniques (en france basées sur décision du tribunal militaire de Nuremberg). Et je ne fais pas une fixette sur Auschwitz, à priori des doutes de la même nature planent sur Gorée.
L'Histoire est écrite par les vainqueurs et serrent toujours à légitimer le pouvoir en place, d'où l'intérêt d'un vrai travail de révision, comme cela a été fait pour la première guerre mondiale sans que cela ne choque personne.

Tiens tu peux regarder un peu du côté de David Cole, un Juif auto-proclamé pour le coup, qui a de gros doutes documentés sur l'existence des chambres à gaz et sur la véracité de ce qu'on a pu de montrer :

I'd have thought your parents' political views did have an effect on you, but what effect that is can vary hugely. Even in your own life you probably know people whose views closely align with those of their parents, and those that deviate from it significantly. There's evidence that suggests that one's peer group has a greater impact on lifestyle choices than one's parents, and I'd be surprised if political views were not similarly tempered, especially given the evolution of social mores over history. In any case nobody's views are moulded solely by the views of their parents.

&gt; I believe if tweens would embrace the internet more for it's information and not facebook/instragtram/twitter theyd have a more balanced view of the world.

Tweens have embraced the internet as previous generations embraced television (and generations way in the past embraced radio or newspapers). The internet might have made public broadcast more accessible but it it still vulnerable to private and state interests, as well as the rather nebulous concept of (public interest). Even reddit is subject to its algorithms and what it refers to as the hivemind, which in many ways is just a crowdsourced version of what every editor tries to guess: the interests of the readership. What counts as a ""balanced"" worldview is highly debatable anyway.

Also the Euro is not the European Union. If the EU would be defined by the Euro the UK wouldn't even have a say and 10 other countries neither. And actually, what countries are we talking about that suffer from the crisis? Greek, Portugal, Spain, Ireland?

Defacto Spains financial crisis had nothing to do with the Euro itself. http://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/staatsverschuldung/tid-26641/das-naechste-opfer-der-euro-krise-zehn-gruende-fuer-den-niedergang-spaniens_aid_786172.html
&gt;Main cause was the housing bubble and other small problems all leading to a crisis.

Greek:
&gt;In the early mid-2000s, Greece's economy was one of the fastest growing in the eurozone and was associated with a large structural deficit. As the world economy was hit by the global financial crisis in the late 2000s, Greece was hit especially hard because its main industries — shipping and tourism — were especially sensitive to changes in the business cycle. The government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the country's debt increased accordingly. [Until it couldn't take any debt anymore.]

Portugal:
&gt;According to a report by the Diário de Notícias Portugal had allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010. Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky credit, public debt creation, and European structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades. When the global crisis disrupted the markets and the world economy, together with the US credit crunch and the Eurozone crisis, Portugal was one of the first and most affected economies to succumb.

Moreover, moral panic about welfare fraud or misuse of welfare, or its effect on disincentivizing work, massively overstates the danger; though such fraud does occur, and some people do spend benefits (arguably) frivolously, as I understand it, social science on the subject has shown that most of the time, the overwhelming majority of the people who receive benefits use them approximately as intended.

This is not about making people miserable, either, but I simply don't see why Germans don't see wage increases (and haven't seen them in decades) to not rock the boat, and everyone else around us demanding 20% more each year. I am sick and tired of being held responsible for someone else's irresponsibility. How about everyone starts building their wealth not on the bank accounts of their states, but on their own accomplishments.

By the way, there is little correlation between money and happiness.

1923 was bad, and for Germany, it was not over in 1929. Mass unemployment persisted well into the 1930s and were one for the major reasons for the rise of the nsdap.

You therefore are right: I don't care about other countries mass unemployment, as long as it is a healthy shrinking process. Every country by definition can only support as many jobs as it's productivity is worth. There is no right to work (but people are always able to either raise productivity or make the state stop throwing stones into the way of people starting their own business).

If you think I am a believer in a false dichotomy,  you believe there's a third option which doesn't include magic at some relevant point. Please share that one with us.

I believe the euro to have been a horrible idea from the very start (and have thought so since the early 1990s when the idea first became relevant) for reasons which happened to prove themselves true in the last few years. I would rather see the euro go bust than not - for everyone living and earning their living in the euro zone, it would be a massive win to go back to national currencies.

**Le prix**

La GBC se trouve sur toutes les brocantes et autres vide-greniers. Il est assez simple de l'obtenir à moins de 10€ et souvent avec au moins 5 jeux dont 1 pokémon. Contrairement à l'atari, il est possible de tester la bête directement. On évitera donc toute mauvaise surprise. Il vous faudra des piles hélas non incluses. Ajoutons [1](http://www.mega-piles.com/piles-ultra-salines-lr6-aa-carbone-zinc-1.50v-x4-p-564)€ pour ces dernières.

Vainqueur : GBC

**Le nom**

Le nom de la Game Boy Color est des plus pertinents. Il nous renseigne sur le type de console : ""Game Boy"" et nous rappelle l'ajout de la principale feature, la couleur, avec : ""Color"". N'est ce pas plus intéressant et utile qu'un nom et un chiffre ? Je le pense. Je le crois. Tout n'est pas coloré cependant, ce brillant nom ne l'est pas tant. Si l'auteur de ce billet parle de cette console au féminin (et qu'il a raison), nombreux sont ceux pour qui le [genre de la ""Game Boy"" reste trouble](https://www.google.fr/search?q=un+ou+une+game+boy&amp;oq=un+ou+une+game). Enfin, la présence du mot ""Game"" et ""Boy"" n'a pas empêché ma petite soeur de me piquer ma console et d'y jouer.

Egalité : PS4 et GBC

**Les Dimensions**

Les grosses cylindrées sont géniales, mais elles ont un très grand défaut ! Elles ne tiennent pas dans la poche arrière de votre jean favoris. A moins de changer radicalement vos atours, la GBC domine grandement cette catégorie.

Vainqueur: GBC

**Les Graphismes**

Si la Game Boy Color pourrait prétendre à la victoire pour son magnifique rendu des couleurs, il faut accepter que ses opposants se débrouillent assez bien et savent aussi afficher des magnifiques dégradés pixelisé. Hélas, je pense que l'auteur du comparatif a négligé un test pourtant décisif. J'ai pris les consoles dans mes mains et je n'ai pas réussi à jouer. Aucune des consoles testées ne comporte d'écran ! Comment jouer aux toilettes me suis je dis ? Si je me pose dans mon jardin avec la PS4 sur mes genoux, les graphismes deviennent invisibles ! J'ai beau fixer la console de Sony, je ne vois rien ! Pour jouer, il vous faudra un couteux et lourd moniteur non inclus dans la boîte ! Inpensable ! Nintendo a pris soin de ses joueurs en proposant en plus une [magnifique loupe](http://www.amazon.fr/Logic-3-Loupe-%C3%A9clairante-GameBoy/dp/B00004Y28V) à un prix attractif. On regrettera que la GBC ne soit pas rétro-éclairée, mais soulignons que ces opposantes ne le sont pas non plus. 

Vainqueur : GBC

**La Puissance**

Si le CPU de la GBC ne brille pas forcément, je mets au défi la Xbox One et la PS4 d'avoir la fluidité avec une RAM de 32ko ! Le MOS Technology 6507 et le Z80 sont tous les deux des processeurs 8 bit. Afin de comparer l'Atari 2600 et la GBC, j'ai décidé de comparer l'autonomie des 2 consoles. J'ai tout débranché et observé. Si la GBC s'en sort bien, l'Atari s'est éteinte et ne s'allume plus ! [Voici un exemple pertinent](http://www.ina.fr/video/PUB1027236052/game-boy-color-de-nintendo-cable-version-30-secondes-video.html). Le jugement est décisif.

Vainqueur : GBC

**Le Son**

Bien que la GBC possède son propre haut-parleur et soit à la base de [nombreuses créations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=dNY0g7s4ryk), son incapacité à lire les CDs et les clefs USB ne la fait pas passer devant la Xbox One.

Egalité : Xbox et GBC

**Les Licences Exclusives**

Il y a aussi Mario sur GBC. Il y a Pokémon sur GBC.

Vainqueur : GBC



**Le Design**

La GBC est déclinée en [6 coloris différents](http://www.gamereactor.se/media/forum/se/6363084_46.jpg). La Xbox One est disponible en 3 coloris. 3 x 2 = 6. D'après le théorème de Thalès, la GBC est mieux.

Vainqueur : GBC

**Les Manettes**

Tout comme la Xbox One, on peut jouer à la GBC sans manette. Nintendo a eu l'astuce de placer les boutons directement sur la console. En s'affranchissant de manette sans pour autant bouleverser les joueurs et sans les espionner, la GBC ne peut que gagner haut la main.

Vainqueur : GBC

**Rétro-comptabilité**

La Game Boy Color est compatible avec la totalité des jeux présents sur Game Boy et Game boy Pocket. L'Atari ne peut même pas lire les jeux Game Boy. Si la GBC ne peut supporter les manettes Megadrive, cela n'est guère pénalisant dans la mesure où la GBC n'a pas besoin de manette.

Vainqueur : GBC

**Tflops**

Idem que pour l'Atari 2600. Je pense à un complot.

Vainqueur : PS4

**Services additionnels**

La GBC dispose d'une superbe imprimante ! Hélas, elle est vendue séparément et ne permet pas d'imprimer du porno.

Vainqueur : Atari 2600

* Some money I had in the back-pocket of my jeans got stolen when I was on the Sacré-Coeur stairs (I was distracted by someone making me a bracelet). The Sacré-Coeur is really beautiful but it is litterally full with pick-pockets or scam-artists and whatnot. This shouldn't prevent you from going, but be careful with your belongings and ignore anyone who might seem ""too nice"" (or is trying to sell you something). 
* The second time, I was in the metro with a friend, it was maybe 9pm and the train was mostly empty. A group of young men came in being very noisy, walking through the train and screamed in my friends face and then left. That was the only kind of scary thing that happened, and I think it could have happened anywhere.


In any case, this shouldn't scare you at all, specially if you are just going for a day. Make sure to stay safe : the number for emergencies in Europe is 112 from any mobile phone, learn how to ask for help in French, don't drink too much, etc.  And finally, enjoy !

A me Berlusconi pare europeista. Ma forse il PD non capisce che fin'ora l'europa è solo economica e poco giuridica. In più, nel PDL, non mi sembra ci sia una linea chiara sull'euro, probabilmente perché non ci capiscono un cazzo.


&gt;certo, il M5S è più una conseguenza che una causa, ma, di fatto, è un potentissimo strumento di immobilità e neutralizzazione d’ogni reale forma di evoluzione politica; però molti grillini non hanno a cuore davvero l’interesse delle classi inghiottite nel tritacarne dell’attuale politica economica, ma solo il proprio autoreferenziale narcisismo, essendo il precipitato del peggio della superficialità culturale che è cominciata negli anni ’80

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt;  I'm just getting really frustrated by how Germany seems to get all the blame.

This either is extremely dishonest or incompetent for you to say. My initial position was ""Greece shouldn't take all the blame"" and you replied to me with a long-ass comment ""disproving"" my position. Everyone downvoted me and upvoted you solidifying the notion that Germany is blameless and Greece is in the position it is today through entirely its own fault. If you didn't want to say any of that, why did you contradict me? I took a moderate position and you managed to make me seem like an ""idiot irresponsible Greek who lives off other people's money and doesn't pay his taxes"". Good job. 

&gt;  and I understand very well that government debt is fine as long as the interest payments stay below economic growth

That applies to households and companies too. I was referring to monetary policy helping out in times of need to fill in the gap. But the ECB sat idle through the worst of the crisis. Why should it? This is a question the answer to which should not be taken for granted to be ""it should not"".

&gt; In short, we need to federalise, but I've lost the hope I had initially had that this crisis would be used to get there. Now it seems we'll just wiggle through it somehow, keep on procrastinating, and eventually end up again right where we are today because nothing along those lines will get done.

If you understand all that, why do you keep contradicting me? That was the initial spirit of my comment: That Greece should not be considered solely responsible for its own demise *because* larger factors were at play. 

Anyway, I agree. At this point a dissolution of the Eurozone seems pretty likely. Federalisation of any sort seems an impossibility right now, too much nationalism. Maybe we should look into the history of nation-building and try to understand how they managed to get to the point of ""rich regions subsidising the poorer ones on a continual basis"" without angering either one. I believe that the answer is, like you said, a central federal institution. The rich regions pay more taxes to the common fund and the institution allocates more of these funds to poorer regions. Therefore, the feeling of the rich regions paying directly for the poor ones is diluted and the problem of the poor regions being manipulated and taken advantage of by the rich ones (in return for the funds) is gone and replaced by systematic common governance. 

&gt; That's one thing I would have liked to see happening. For the short term, I would have liked an EU-controlled (as opposed to going through the Greek government) mechanism to provide money for investments in Greek infrastructure (beyond the normal funds) as a stimulus and direct credit to Greek companies to protect the healthy parts of the economy from unnecessarily going bankrupt due to dried up credit.

Take a look at that Varoufakis' guy ""modest proposal"". He says that the European Investment Bank can play the role you say backed by the ECB and/or bonds it will issue on the market. Indeed, I agree that pseudo-federal programmes could be the basis for a temporary solution but it's pretty evident that, with the way things are going now, the creditor countries won't accept this before it's too late. 

&gt; Yeah, I'd have also changed some of the terms, but I don't think it would have been politically feasible. 

Sure, but shouldn't the politicians of these countries at least try to explain to their citizenry that this is the cost you pay for the monetary union? Of course they'll disagree if the narrative is ""those damn pigs squandered their money, they're now in debt and we have to pay it!"". I too would disagree with that if I didn't know how grossly inaccurate it is. 

&gt;  I've even said that the ECB should aim for moderately higher inflation (as is they don't even meet their 2% target), but the ECB was set up to be as independent from political interference as possible (for reasons I happen to agree with).

Eh, I disagree. The central bank's job is a public matter therefore it should be subject to public control. The argument that ""monetary policy is too important to be left to the hands of the public"" is a dangerous slippery slope. What other policies are there that are ""too important to allow the public to mess with them""? Fiscal policy? Taxes? Defence? We either live in a democracy where political decisions are ultimately done by the public or we don't.

&gt; Germany had, and still has, one of the highest labour costs in the world. In manufacturing[1] , it's about 50% more than the UK's. It's higher than in France or the Netherlands, for example, and those aren't exactly economically underdeveloped countries known for exploiting their workers. When we enacted those reforms, and labour unions agreed to wage restraint, Germany was the ""sick man of Europe"" and everybody was saying how we needed to do those things, or else. Of course this meant a relative loss of competitiveness for the rest of the Eurozone (because regaining competitiveness was the whole point), but it's not as if wages there had stuck to growing in line with inflation and productivity increase (except for France, they're the odd ones out here who neither de- nor inflated their wages relative to inflation).

[Watch the Heiner Flassbeck video I posted earlier for a retort to this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=iPFH-yXm9VY) I don't think German labour costs were a problem, not really. It would only mean that the surplus would be smaller. I can sympathise with the argument ""but the factories would leave for greener pastures"" but that happens a lot less than some people assume and it's a race-to-the-bottom argument on top of that. German states have been forced to subsidise the mini-jobs and all that. Why is it fair to ask the unions and the employees to make sacrifices but never the rich? 

&gt; Greece took the deal because the alternative would have been worse

It's certainly the most conservative and less risky approach but I would not say strictly preferable. There's no way someone can model what would happen exactly anyway. In the short term, sure, it would be a problem. In the long term, assuming that the situation keeps going like it is going now, it would likely be better. The Eurozone would be forced to deal with the fallout and then the necessary steps (federalisation etc) would become politically feasible or it would dissolve. As the first guy out Greece would be probably be better prepared. It would be ugly but I think there's a good chance it's a preferable option to the obvious dead end we're in right now.

It may be hurt as a response, but why should i have camaraderie with you? I don't have any camaraderie with every single person i meet in the street every day just because they are Italian. They are just *people*. From your point of view they are special people, because they are italian, from my point of view they are just *normal people*. 

But I am not sure: Have you ever talked with other people the some non-american root? do they feel they same? Or this is typical only of italian?

I have a friend that is from Argentina, but he lives in Italy since 35 years. He says that when he is in Argentina he is seen as an Italian, and when he is in Italy he is seen as an Argentinian.

&gt; Is it because of that dumb ass Jersey Shore show

lol no! it's not even very famous here (or maybe it is... Mtv always boradcast it... I don't know, i should talk with some teenager). It's not about the Jersey Shore show: nobody even knows that those people are supposed to be half Italian. It may sound funny, but from an italian point of view, those people are *americans* in an weird *american show*: most of the people here don't realize/know they are supposed to be *italian*, neither the Mtv advertisment of that show ever claimed that. Most of the people here are surprised when they learn that ""Jersey Shore"" is a reality show about the life of some half-italian people.

&gt; when I say that I am Americani they almost always cool off from me and end the conversation abruptly

It may be also some linguistic barrier. And don't forget that in Italy we have a long history of emigration, but a short history of immigration, so we don't have that multicultural view of the society. Being ""half italian"" is not yet understandable to the average man here.

&gt;  While experiments have been conducted in the United States and Canada, those participating knew that their benefits were not permanent and, consequently, they were not likely to change their behaviour as much or in the same manner had the GAI been ongoing. As a result, total hours worked fell by about five percent on average. The work reduction was largest for second earners in two-earner households and weakest for the main earner. Further, the negative work effect was higher the more generous the benefit level.

But if you accept that then the issue becomes unfalsifiable. With huge policy changes like this one it's impossible to have a study predict what the outcome is going to be. But if you consider this risk to be totally unacceptable then you'll never allow for any huge social change on the same grounds.

Thus, a Proto-Celtic ethnic name *Bolgī could be interpreted as ""The People who Swell (particularly with anger/battle fury)"".[1][2][3][4][5]

I didn't say they had the same meaning.  I said that they were similar; perhaps ""associated"" would be a better way to describe their relationship.  In the same way that a boatman is someone who pilots a boat, a trader is someone who sells merchandise.  It is easy to imagine that the word for merchandise shares a similar etymology with the word for trader, at least in Latin.

At various income levels, the result would be like this:

| Earned Income | Payment    | Final Income     |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| 0        |          10,000|     10,000
| 5,000  |    7,500|  12,500
| 10,000       |   5,000     | 15,000  
| 15,000       |  2,500      |17,500
| 20,000     |  0    | 20,000

It guarantees that earning more money results in increasing your income, and also caps the payments so you're not wasting money on people who don't need it.  Once you're earning double the UBI, you receive no payment.

I haven't done a proper costing, but this type of system obviously limits the total money paid out compared to an across-the-board payment of the same amount.  This certainly allows you to set a higher UBI, and could also free up some money for other narrowly-targeted payments (such as disability assistance).",0,1388488572,null,0,false,0,cee0w76,t3_1u1m38,t1_cee0w76,t1_cedps2q,null,1427919456,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I´m a spaniard (bare with my English, please!) and although I can see that /u/khthon wasn´t trying to make the point I am going to explain, he was absolutely spot on with this observation:

The Popular Party in Spain is the conservative party, with its shades of conservatism. After the civil war (there is a lot of polemic about the issue and I am not going to go into this, its the never ending story and it hurts a lot of people) and the authoritarian rule of Franco, we didn´t end this chapter of our history with the dictator defeated by The People and with a change inspire by the power of these people. Instead we ended this chapter of our history with the dictator dying calmly in bed while passing the rule on to a king who decided he was going to allow a democracy. The Constitution was written (inspired by other constitutions, bla bla bla) and it was voted and our system was born. As you can see in this process there are a lot of ways the system could have been corrupted or shaped by the wrong people... Then we saw how people that belonged to Franco´s government, in those political parties, Democratic parties, having high ranked positions. Let´s take Manuel Fraga for example: [he was Ministro de Información y Turismo (the censorship structure in the regime) with Franco and was one of the writers of the Constitution and a minister and senator in the democratic system. Also being the person who founded the Popular Party.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Fraga_Iribarne) May I remind the reader that these people swore loyalty to the dictator. Because of this, many of us think that the fascists are still in the power structure and still passing laws and still pushing in the democratic system for their ideology. Of course we have to refer to their ideology because they are doing this in a democratic (with its ups and downs) system. We don´t actually have a fascist government, but their ideas are been pushed into the system.

&gt; In England at the time of the Norman Conquest, Flemings (natives of Flanders) formed a substantial mercenary element in the forces of William the Conqueror with many remaining in England as settlers under the Normans. Contingents of mercenary Flemish soldiers were to form significant forces in England throughout the time of the Norman and early Plantagenet dynasties (11th and 12th centuries). A prominent example of these were the Flemings that fought during the English civil wars, known as the Anarchy or the Nineteen-Year Winter (AD 1135 to 1154), under the command of William of Ypres, who was King Stephen's chief lieutenant from 1139 to 1154 and who was made Earl of Kent by Stephen

&gt;De oorsprong en betekenis van de naam Groningen en de oudere variant 'Groeningen' zijn niet zeker. Dichters probeerden het te koppelen aan een volksverhaal over ballingen uit Troje die onder leiding van een zekere mythische figuur Gruno (of Grunius, Gryns of Grunus) hier een nederzetting met Frygiërs uit Duitsland zou hebben gesticht in 453 v.Chr. (volgens een andere overlevering in 130 v.Chr.) en een kasteel hebben gebouwd aan de Hunze dat hij 'Grunoburg' noemde. Dat kasteel zou later weer door de Vikingen zijn verwoest en later zou mogelijk op de fundamenten hiervan de Sint-Walburgkerk zijn gebouwd. Er is echter geen enkel bewijs voor deze verhalen.[7]

&gt;Een andere theorie stelt dat de naam Groningen is afgeleid van de mansnaam 'Groni'. Hierbij wordt verwezen naar het voorkomen van de vroege spelwijzen 'Groningi' en 'Groninga' in de 11e eeuw en de oude naam 'Gronesbeke' voor een watertje nabij de Hunze (noordgrens van Everswolde). De naam zou dan betekenen 'bij de lieden van Groni'.[8]

&gt;Weer een andere theorie over de oorsprong is dat de oude naam Groeningen is afgeleid van 'Groen-inge'; ""groene velde(n)"". 'groen' zou daarbij van 'cruon' komen en een inge (of enge) is een oude benaming voor een open veld, die in het Saksische gedeelte van Nederland en Duitsland vaak heuvelachtig was. In het wapen van Groningen (en de vlag) zou dit terugkomen in de groene streep; een groene strook land; tussen de Lauwers, de Eems en de Waddenzee.

&gt;De Groningse dialectnaam Grunnen heeft dezelfde etymologie. Grun, van het oudere gruun en -inge werd vertaald naar -en of -ens, net zoals in de naam Kantens, dat vroeger waarschijnlijk Kantinge was en wat tegenwoordig nog steeds in het Gronings gebeurt, bijvoorbeeld Thesinge wordt Taisen. Zoals bij de meeste Groningse woorden die op -en eindigen, valt ook hier de -e weg, waardoor je de uitspraak grunn krijgt. Doordat het Groningen is, had het in het Gronings ook Grunnens kunnen zijn, zoals bij Kantens, wat de Friese naam Grins tevens verklaart (vergelijk ook Harlingen – Harns).

&gt;In de provincie Groningen wordt de plaats vanouds ook ""Stad"" genoemd.[9] Daarbuiten wordt deze naam ook wel gebruikt, hoewel de meeste Friezen Grins zullen zeggen. In de Middeleeuwen werd de Latijnse naam Groninga gebruikt op kaarten en munten. Ten tijde van de Franse bezetting heette Groningen Groningue. Zelf noemen de inwoners zich ""Stadjers"" of ""Stadjeder"". De stad wordt ook wel de ""metropool van het Noorden"" genoemd. Stadjers noemen haar liefkozend ook wel ""Groot Loug"", dat wil zeggen ""Groot Dorp"". Een andere bijnaam van Groningen is Martinistad, verwijzend naar de Martinitoren.

Antverpia would come from Ante (before) Verpia (deposition, sedimentation), indicating land that forms by deposition in the inside curve of a river (which is in fact the same origin as Germanic waerpen). Note that the river Scheldt, before a transition period between 600 to 750, followed a different track. This must have coincided roughly with the current ringway south of the city, situating the city within a former curve of the river.

Les camps de concentration n'est pas un sujet tabou, voir Desproges et la vanne : ""Et j'irais à la douche si je veux"" jusqu'aux blagues enfantines sur les oiseaux qui passant au dessus des camps et qui font : ""Cuits, Cuits"".

Cohen mérité d'être brocardé et pris en exemple car il incarne bêtement cette nouvelle royauté médiatique qui comptent dicter au peuple de France et du Monde, qui est invitable et qui ne l'est pas. Le fait qu'il soit Juif ou pas ne doit pas le protéger de cela.

Cela fait du 10 ans que cela dure oui, le boycott de Dieudonné pour un sketch, certes raté, mais qui ne faisait que viser les travers du Judaïsme à travers l'idéologie raciste du sionisme. Rien n'a été déclenché comme tu sembles le dire par le refus du CNC. Même s'il lui est plus facile de voir un film comique sur l'esclavage sortir plutôt qu'un film dit sérieux.

Oui le but d'un comique est de faire parler de lui s'il veut continuer à faire son travail en remplissant ses salles par la publicité, je ne vois pas ce que tu lui reproches sachant qu'il est banni des médias. Dieudonné continue à faire rire ""les gens"", il ne te fait plus ou pas rire (comme le CRIF) et cela ne doit avoir aucune influence sur son destin.

Les politiciens n'ont que très récemment pris la lutte contre Dieudonné comme cheval de bataille et cela va échouer comme la stratégie de la chappe de plomb. Voir l'analyse de Soral dans sa dernière vidéo du mois.

Beaucoup, des zéniths entiers à travers la France, l'aiment, rient de ses blagues tout en gardant un esprit critique (je n'ai pas aimé le film l'antisémite par exemple, car il manquait de bons mots), et le respectent.

Je doute qu'il passe à autre chose, l'avenir nous le dira mais comme tu l'as bien dit il n'a pas baissé la tête en dix ans, d'où les pressions judiciaires, fiscales et maintenant médiatiques que l'on met sur lui.

Bonne année tout de même, si tu n'en as pas il faudrait prendre un abonnement à Charlie Hebdo, ils se meurent eux malgré une belle exposition médiatique provocatrice et subventionnée :)

Corrupt houses of cards tumbling down in Spain, Portugal, Italy.

This is such a huge claim with so little evidence to back it up. We see suddenly a range of completely different countries, from Spain to Greece to Ireland collapsing and people keep saying ""it's all unrelated, it's all a coincidence"". The euro was a catalyst for German surpluses that had to be invested somewhere, anywhere. It was a catalyst for Greece having extremely low interest rates. It was a catalyst for the real estate bubbles in Spain and Ireland. But no, you choose to ignore the underlying common theme and opt for the explanation that is the most *convenient*. 

I guess people will only start to acknowledge the systemic roots of the crisis when *their* country collapses too.

&gt;Chaque papier a une définition différente.

Les chiffres viennent tous de l'ONZUS, et les définitions y sont précisées à chaque fois.

&gt;Vous faites un raccourci selon lequel ""les émeutiers"" est un synonyme pour ""les ZUS"".

C'est le cas pour 85% des émeutes. [Rapport ici](http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/24/13/26/PDF/Hugues_Lagrange.pdf). Citation :

*Une faible fraction (15%) des quartiers impliqués ne sont pas classés en ZUS.*

&gt;Vous ne semblez pas accorder beaucoup d'importance à la nuance. émeutier==ZUS==immigré.

C'est le cas dans l'immense majorité, je n'y peux rien. Il y a une autre analyse [ici](http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/47/66/33/PDF/recension_FPCS_finale_2_pdf.pdf).

On ne peut plus continuer à nier la réalité, à considérer que tout est économique, ou que tout est social. Il y a des populations qui, indépendamment de tous les critères sociaux-économiques, sont plus souvent délinquants que d'autres. C'est le cas pour une plus forte proportion des immigrés **masculins**, d'Afrique du Sahel, et il y a une part de culture, d'éducation, qui n'est pas du ressort de l'État mais bien des familles d'origine. Ce n'est par contre par une question de couleur de peau ou de discrimination d'État, en effet les filles ~~maghrébines~~ de Maroc et de Tunisie réussissent mieux à l'école que les filles ""de souche"" et les enfants d'origine béninoise garçons et filles ont un taux de réussite scolaire assez élevé également.

We're after power and we mean it... There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced or objectively interpreted – and you create a nation of law-breakers – and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's the system, Mr. Reardon, that's the game, and once you understand it, you'll be much easier to deal with.”

For the rest our general historical sense is it was just foreigners that fought in these parts, while the local people  huddled in their hovels, waiting for the storm to pass.

Basically what happened is that every ethnic group of people that isn't from Northern Europe stuck to their own kind a bit so to say. Portuguese Americans, Italian Americans, Greek Americans, Polish Americans all got hated on for being different than people from Northern Europe so they all decided to stay in the same ethnic neighborhoods and were much more likely to retain things from their country of heritage. All of those things developed into a sense of pride for their roots. It's happening right now to people from Central America and Mexico, there is a small part of the population who is racist toward them and they are all settling in ethnic neighborhoods. Immigrants children are being brought up American but since they are stuck in between two cultures they are fiercely proud of being Mexican, Guatemalan etc etc and will root for the Mexican national football team even if they can't speak good Spanish.

true,anarquistos,LITH,Lithuania,"Well Hong Kong was not a heavily urbanized area before starting free market reforms. Neither was Singapore, or any of the ""tiger"" economies in Asia. Most of them were just fishing villages and backwaters in the world economics. And then there were plenty of people starving in these countries before significant liberalization, but I don't think there are many who are starving now. Part of the beauty of free markets is that the capital does not stay in the same hands for long if it is not constantly invested and used for research and innovation. if money is not invested and used in new production it just get's eaten up. Same as with kids from rich families, who just use up all their inherited money and do not create anything productive. 

And besides income inequality and distribution is an almost useless point of statistics. Being 90% poorer than the millionaire next door still means that you live a decently comfortable life. I would rather have that, than earning exactly as much as the richest person in the country, when you both are on the brink of starvation. Ethiopia, Niger and Pakistan have equal income distribution indexes as countries like Canada or [Australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Income_Gini_Map_%282013%29.svg). There is an old joke about the old Ussr - ""Everyone was equal - nobody had anything.""

For me it's hard to think of an example of a country ruined by free markets, where people who used to be in the upper middle class now starve to death, because the rich have concentrated all the capital in their hands. History shows plenty of examples though where trying to make everyone equal has led to disasters. 

One bad example of capitalism gone wrong (or going wrong) could be the USA, but that is because of crony capitalism, lobbying and an overreaching and pretentious government, that just has massive amount of money created by a working and developed market. But that is no fault of capitalism, it's just that in a rich country stupid and evil people in the government can do much more harm.

You respond to my argument with platitudes such as ""investment is good"". Investment as a general concept is good, but having one country trying a mercantilist approach of maximising surplus while being in a currency union is catastrophic. One country obsessively trying to amass surpluses in this situation will lead to everyone else to be indebted. It's an accounting impossibility to argue otherwise, since one country's surpluses are another country's deficits. [As Flassbeck said](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPFH-yXm9VY):

&gt; It was the famous beggar thy neighbour approach, without any possibility to retaliate. It was the unique historical situation, that Germany could use that it was by coincidence in a currency union at the time when it went for a neo-classical experiment of cutting wages, that it could be successful on the external side. This will never be repeated in the next, say, 200-300 years. No country will ever go into a currency union with a country that at the same time follows such a mercantilist approach. It would be absolutely foolish to do that.

You also asked me a question:

&gt; &amp; yet the crisis hit country's populations all want to keep the euro. What does that tell you?

First of all, it's not strictly true. The euro's popularity has fallen sharply among crisis-hit countries. But even so, it tells me that either they're idiots and don't see the connection or that they're afraid of the repercussions that an exit from the monetary union would entail.

&gt; Modern self identification as Italian is a product of the rise of nationalism in the 19th and 20th centuries

This is the correct answer. Given the peculiar nature of Risorgimento (strong national self-consciousness among the elites, nearly non existent national self-consciousness among the masses), we can't talk of developed, recognized and shared cultural italian identity until the end of WW1. 

The trenches of the eastern front is where for the first time in history people from all over the country recognize each other as fellow italian, fighting back to back for a freshly discovered common cause (illiteracy was huge back then, and that means that most of those folks had never heard of what Italy could be before being taught what they were being sent to fight for). Sure the wartime propaganda the soldiers were the first recipient of played a big part, with all its rhetoric about the sacred borders and all the like, and sure being surrounded with armed and hostile foreigners was a very good motivation in order to begin to bond with each other speaking your language, but that did the trick, and '15-'18 resulted in the moment that officially ended the unification of Italy",0,1388500630,null,0,false,0,cee3012,t3_1u39f6,t1_cee3012,t3_1u39f6,null,1427918189,11,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,11

Vous n'avez pas lu les rapports. Vous n'avez absolument pas cherché à connaître la vérité. Vous avez uniquement voulu contredire mes remarques.

Il suffisait pourtant d'aller sur la [page wikipedia](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89meutes_de_2005_dans_les_banlieues_fran%C3%A7aises), et de regarder les sources.

En particulier [ce rapport](http://www.cairn.info/article.php?REVUE=annales&amp;ANNEE=2006&amp;NUMERO=4&amp;PP=809), qui note bien que ce sont également des jeunes de seconde génération.

Des rapports qui confirment ce que je dis, j'en ai encore au moins deux. Cherchez au moins des sources qui me contredisent si vous ne cherchez pas à vous renseigner ou à apprendre.

&gt;Ces deux sujets sont justement en rapport direct avec le niveau social.

Pas entièrement. D'une part il ne suffit pas d'affirmer pour prouver, d'autre part je n'ai pas dit qu'il n'y avait pas de rapport. J'ai dit :

*Il y a des populations qui, indépendamment de tous les critères sociaux-économiques, sont plus souvent délinquants que d'autres*

et

*Ce n'est par contre par une question de couleur de peau ou de discrimination d'État*.

&gt;Quand on est pauvre on a moins d'éducation que quand on est riche

C'est faux, et ce n'est pas ce que j'ai dit. Le cas des boat-people asiatiques par exemple est un contre-exemple parfait. Et je répète encore une fois l'exemple des filles d'origine marocaine et tunisienne qui, à niveau socio-économique égal, réussissent MIEUX que les Françaises ""de souche"".

&gt;Vous sortez ça à partir de rien, aucune des études que vous citez ne parle du sujet.

C'est dans l'introduction de ce rapport :

http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/docs_ffc/ref/IMMFRA12_d_D2_scol.pdf

C'est écrit en gras, tout au début :

**Enfin, les filles de l’immigration marocaine ou tunisienne, et dans une moindre mesure celles de l’immigration sahélienne, obtiennent plus souvent un baccalauréat que les filles ni immigrées ni enfants d’immigrés, si l’on raisonne à caractéristiques sociales et familiales données.**

Et voilà. Mais plutôt que de chercher à vous renseigner, vous préférez nier la vérité qui vous dérange.

&gt;je serais très curieux de lire une seule étude qui dise que ""indépendamment de tous les critères sociaux-économiques, telle ou telle population est plus souvent délinquante qu'une autre"".

Par exemple, les études et livres de Hugues Lagrange que je cite dans un [autre commentaire](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1u0e4f/les_emeutes_de_2005/cedggc4).

La culture. Je l'ai dit plus haut :

true,xpertshot,null,null,"Hi there. 
I'm currently in my first semester as a full-time student at a German university. I'm glad that I can share some of my hell with you in order that it might make your experience a little easier.

A bit of background for context:
I have a degree in German from a US university. This is important, because I needed it in order to satisfy the entrance qualification (Typically satisfied by the Germans with an Abitur). While having a degree in the language is helpful, my current success wouldn't be possible without a German language immersion program (3 semesters in total) prior to my current studies in Germany. I'm studying computer science and my courses are mostly in German with some English thrown in from time to time. Most programs at state universities will be in German at least until you get into upper division classes.

And now to the goodies.
Money:
Financial aid won't be available as you know it from the US. FAFSA doesn't apply to all but 3 or so German universities. Most do, however, apply towards deferment of existing loans if you have any. Working here is only legally possible with a residency permit (Aufenthaltsbewilligung), which you get as a student. Jobs are hit or miss depending on where you study. A lot of student jobs pay 400 Euros a month flat, although you can find regular part time jobs as well that don't have such a limit. Something to be aware of, though, is that there is a limit of 450 Euros per month earned as astudent before you have to pay taxes. 

Housing:
If you've never lived in Germany for an extended period, then I would highly recommend the student housing through the university. It's pretty inexpensive and includes all utilities. The price varies, but 300 Euros per month is a reasonable estimate for planning purposes. It is possible to find cheaper apartments in most cities, but you lose the opportunity as a foreigner to get to know other students. Student housing ftw. 

Residency Permit:
This is a long and painful process. The pain comes from having to wait. Please keep in mind that my experience, and the following information, applies to the German state of Baden-Würrtemberg (SW Germany). In order to get a RP you will need the following:
Proof of enrollment/admittance to a university (Not necessarily the immatrikulationsbescheinigung)
Proof of financial support (either savings (~8000 per year) or proof of income from your parents (That they can give ~650 Euro per month))
Proof of registration with the city (This requires that you have an address in the city (i.e. apartment/WG))
Proof of German health insurance
And a fee for the processing. 
The process required a 4 week waiting time for an appointment (in person) to review my application. After the review my application was submitted and about 4 weeks later I got my permit. PLAN AHEAD FOR THIS.

Uni application:
The hardest part about getting into the uni as an American is that you don't have an Abitur to prove how good you are. SATs and ACTs help, but they alone aren't good enough. I went the route of graduating with a B.A. in the US before applying, and the B.A. counted as my qualification. Another option would be to complete a preparation course through a Fachhochschule, which last about a year depending on the program, and would qualify you for a uni. I had to apply through a system called UniAssist. I would recommend that you call the uni directly as ask the international department if you can bypass UniAssist somehow. It's a piece of shit for international students. Essentially you'll have to pay their fee to hear them tell you ""no"" because you don't have an Abitur.
To apply to the uni (or UniAssist) you'll need:
Proof of qualification (Outlines on the uni's website. Usually an Abitur or degree of some sort)
Transcripts from high school (and college if you have credits)
Language certification (Outlined by the uni per degree program. Mine required B2/C1 proficiency) (This is a hard part. Do research)
And an application packet that you get usually get from the uni's website. 
This doesn't seem like much but it can get tedious trying to figure out what you ACTUALLY need as a foreign student.

That covers most of the bases that you'll need to consider. I would recommend the following order of operation:
Language certification -&gt; Apply to uni -&gt; Request an appointment for the RP -&gt; Find an apartment -&gt; Start looking for work -&gt; Register with city -&gt; Get health insurance -&gt; RP appointment -&gt; Complete registration with the Uni (requires RP) -&gt; Find work -&gt; Study your ass off.

I hope this helps. I know it's a wall of text, but if you're serious about studying in Germany, then it won't be the last wall of text you go through before you get there.

Please ask any questions you may have.

Edit: The hell was getting here. I couldn't be more happy with where I am now that I'm here, though. :)

true,MadAce,BELG,Belgium,"I'm going to say something that's taboo. Gonna be funny to see people's reactions. :-)

It's not because you can make fun of something that you should.

Sure, you're allowed to make fun of dead children, 9/11, rape, the holocaust, the N-word, fallen soldiers, child-abuse, very important politicians (like JFK, Churchill, Lumumba, Mandela, Ataturk, De Gaulle, Ghandi, Mao, ...), having sex with dead people, dead celebrities, the founding fathers, slavery, pedophilia, people with a horrible serious illness, but you're bound to offend people doing so.
Why do something that you know will offend people. Plenty of funny things to do and say that are less likely to offend a lot less people.

**""But they're wrong to be offended!""**

That's pretty much irrelevant. Maybe you're right and the holocaust should be at the pinnacle of every comedian's show but the fact is that some people ARE offended, whether or not that's rational. Plenty of weird cultural quirks people have.

If at all possible, don't make people sad. It's a nice rule to follow.

**""You're being obtuse. Of course I'm not saying all THOSE taboos are wrong to be taboos, but those held by Muslims obviously are wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""**

Again, irrelevant. If I know something I do will upset someone and I gain nothing from doing so, then I don't see why I would do it. Unless my aim is to upset that someone.
For the sake of argument I'll just agree that Muslims/theists are intellectually speaking sub-humans and that things like cultural identity, philosophy and theology are of course completely and utterly useless and downright retarded. However, people hold those beliefs nonetheless and sometimes making fun of those ideas, which people often hold quite dear will make them sad.

If at all possible, don't make people sad. It's a nice rule to follow.

It's irrational for an animal to be afraid of me baring my teeth to it. Of course I won't hurt it. But it'll still be afraid and distressed.
So I won't bare my teeth if possible. Is that an infringement of my rights? No. I still have the right. I just choose not to be an asshole.

**""Muslims should be taught what they're allowed to be offended about!!!!!!!""**

I think that, within reason, people should be allowed to be wrong. Hell, that's a right protected in a democratic society.

**""Christians don't mind being made fun off!!!!!!!!""**

Some of them do mind[.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism) However, I'd wager there are certain societal factors that make people more extreme that are less present in ""Christian"" societies.
Remember, correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation.

**""People shouldn't have to be afraid to exercise a right!!!!!""**

I absolutely agree to a massive degree. However, when exercising said right makes those who would take that right away from me stronger, and when there's no good reason for me to exercise said right, save to make innocent bystanders sad, then perhaps I should look at the cost-benefit.

**""Being made fun of is the best way to integrate in our society!!!!!""**

Are you saying it's teasing, not bullying?

**""YES!!!!!!!!!!!""**

Oh, okay.

**""Don't you know that extremists will stop being extremist after their ideas have been mocked!!! IDIOT!!!!""**

To be honest, I very much doubt that. On the contrary.

If you're an organization fighting for the remembrance of fallen soldiers then a comedian making fun of that subject is bound to bring in more than a few sympathy-members.

Not that I'm saying that mockery is what causes extremism. But it's not exactly going to decrease it in a comical fashion akin to an extremist going 'Haha! That Palin guy is pretty funny. Now thanks to his mockery I realize my entire belief-system is flawed.'

Reality doesn't work like that, I'm afraid.

**""You sure care a lot about what a bunch of extremists think!!!!!!!!!""**

I don't mind offending extremists. I mind providing them with ideological ammunition unless absolutely necessary.
I mind making innocent bystanders sad, tho.

If at all possible, don't make people sad. It's a nice rule to follow.

**""People don't get killed making jokes about the holocaust!!!!!""**

And there's comedians out there making fun of Islam/Muslims who are still alive. On the other hand we live in a society where information and opinions are constantly shaped, deformed, censored, observed on mind-boggling scales by corporations and governments. And in those instances people ARE killed, DO disappear, ARE jailed, on the most extreme end and on the less extreme, but yet still quite horrific, end our entire perception of reality is a tool of the powerful... And the entities doing these crimes are indeed often ""democratic"" and ""enlightened"".

Muslims extremists are amateurs. Although they did achieve to galvanize much of reddit behind draw-muhammed-day. Collective action which the aforementioned crimes have triggered in a surely lesser extent.

It pays to see the various instances of violent censorship in proportion and direct just anger accordingly.

**""Holy crap, you're actually so stupid as to think that if we're actually NICE to Muslims that the extremism will stop!!!! Retard!!!!""**

I don't think that. The socio-economic issues that usually cause extremist behavior are still mostly present, no matter what our comedians do. But being terrorized, acting less civilized, less democratic, is EXACTLY what extremists want.
They'd like nothing more than discriminatory behavior making it easier for them to pray on those they have in their sights.

Tho I believe that being nice will make the world a better place, in general.

**""So you're saying we should give in to the terrorists!!!!!!!!!!!!!""**

Well, if by giving in you mean overreacting and drastically altering the way a certain percentage of the population is regarded and treated both by the government and by the general public then I guess it's a little too late to stop doing exactly what extremists want.
Well, if by giving in you mean systematically supporting Israel, invading countries for no constructive reason whatsoever, having secret and overt prisons where people are treated in a horrific way, erecting a massive surveillance-apparatus, then I guess it's a little too late to stop doing exactly what extremists want.

All I'm saying is, if it doesn't cost you anything whatsoever to make the world a nicer, more considerate place, then why not do it?

A right isn't an obligation.

Money will make them secular. Education will convince them to stop wearing towels. I checked the fb of a ""moderate"" muslim friend of mine. When I look at her teen pics I notice her wearing the hijab less and less. I haven't seen her wear it ever since she's in Uni.

It's also easier to fall back on tradition when people are feeling like their culture is under attack. This doesn't mean you're not allowed to ridicule them. This does mean your ridiculing won't get you the results you actually want. Say your a M. United fan and I start insulting your team will this push you away from your fav football team?

they probably don't know english.

which doesn't mean that they don't speak a word of it, but they may have a too limited knowledge of english to be able to entertain a conversation with a native speaker. They probably want to avoid the embarrassment. 

Or they may know english, may understand and be able to write it, but lack the communicative skill/experience needed in an oral conversation. 

I'm 18, and you would be surprised at the number of people who just can't get english. The percentage is directly proportional to the person's age: english was not a mandatory subject, some schools only taught french, some people started learning it only in high school. Now it's mandatory starting in 1st grade. 

Furthermore, quite too often teachers aren't really that good at it and tend to avoid having to talk or interact with the classroom in english, and opt for teaching only grammar and using batteries of written/multiple choice tests as the only way of measuring students' performance. 

It's quite rare to be able to apprehend oral [english] communication skills (and confidence in them) at school. There are obviously exceptions, distinct teachers, good schools and/or language schools, as in everything. 

EDIT: a little anecdote... I remember that my first english teacher was unable to even talk in italian without a marked accent. She was really funny when she tried to speak english, even for elementary school students. 
One day in a classroom debate it turned out that she considered herself fit for her (temporary?) position because she stayed in the uk. As part of a 3/4 weeks vacation. 

the most interesting part? She took a cruise to get there, and yes, the travel was included in the 3 weeks figure. When asked to explain why she didn't take a plane, her answer was something along the lines of ""cauz on planes there are terrorists""

The last school I went to, on the other hand, was at the opposite end of the spectrum. The teacher was competent and quite rigorous. The average grade of the classroom was 4.something, over 10. I gave up.

I don't follow Dawkins for the same reason I don't subscribe to /r/atheism.

I'm not singling out that tweet about Islam because it's about Islam, I'm singling it out because it's tabloid quality speech.  It doesn't belong, anywhere, in reasoned debate about religion and science, which I agree is often stifling to progress.

Is that an admission he can write garbage on twitter as long as he argues eloquently elsewhere?  In that case I am entirely correct to take him up on the quality of his twitter comments; if he can't get his message across accurately he (and you) should expect critique, which is what I'm doing.

Ad esempio, ultimamente una sentenza della Corte di Cassazione ha statuito che usare l'espressione ""frocio"" è di per sé offensiva.

Il tema può essere affrontato anche dal punto di vista di altre discipline come la sociologia, la pedagogia, la filosofia, che occupandosi di minoranze sottolineano l'importanza dei significato e delle espressioni che usiamo. Un esempio, per non rimanere solo sull'ambito dell'omosessualità, può essere fatto in relazione alle minoranze etniche in europa e negli stati uniti ed all'integrazione: se in Inghilterra ti riferisci a persone di origine africana con l'espressione ""di colore"" invece che semplicemente ""nera"" ti guardano storto, perché ritenuto offensivo (sarebbe come se riferendosi a noi dicessero ""sbiaditi"" invece di bianchi). E' una corrente di pensiero a cui si è rifatta anche il ministro Kyenge appena insediatosi:sono nera, disse, non riferitevi a me dicendo che sono di colore.

We've had a case where a politician pointed out that Pakistani people in Britain are hugely corrupt and the next day he was forced to apologise for stating a fact that offended some corrupt Pakistanis. It really is quite sad when you have to ignore facts because one group decides they want to keep it quite. 

It's a similar story with gypsies too, everyone in the countryside fears them because they are always trouble when they decide to set up camp in your area. But the bohemian BBC and Guardian types + the council and the police will tell you're they're a marginalised group who get discriminated against and need to be welcomed with open arms. Then the first thing they do when they move to an area is steal everything that isn't tied down and start fights with the locals. If you complain everyone who doesn't actually live in the area calls you a ""racist"".

But then, the most common way for relationships to form is the following:

1. You have a circle of friends
2. Among those circle of friends, or its extended circle, there's someone or multiple you like better, and in a special way
3. Which naturally leads to everyone having a list, possibly ordered, of people they're interested *more* in.
4. You all commence being friends, doing friend stuff, being just that bit of more appreciative and friendly to those on your list than to the rest
5. After some time and observation, individuals figure out the lists of others, in particular the lists of people that are on their own lists, and thus whether they are on someone else's list.
6. You start to do stuff more often with people which are both on your list as well as you being on their list. This is, more or less, just a targeted intensifying of 4.
7. At some point, you spend your holidays alone with someone, or do something else to a similar effect.
8. If you, when coming back, don't hate each other, you're, for all intents and purposes, considered to be married (for the time being), as a holiday together is a darn good relationship test.

How often, and to what degree, you engage in baseball metaphors while doing that is completely unspecified.

London has more foreign visitors than Paris and the average visitor to London spends about twice as much money as they do in Paris. 

You have all the advantages of sunny weather and big beaches and being in the Schengen area but you can't get foreigners to part with their cash the way we can. A tourist who pops over the border from Spain or Germany, brings their own supplies, takes up some space on the beach and then leaves without spending is not benefiting you any. We're already ahead of you from the moment the tourists get off the plane and realise they have buy a new jumpers because it's freezing cold. 

Our castles attract people to Scotland. Scotland. The land of continual winter and fried chocolate bars. That is the power of a millennia old Monarchy. 

Any fool could book tourists to a sunny beach, but to get them to come to a place that's cold and wet and dreary for 360 days of the year, that takes something extra.

Fact is, the governments and the social structures in many countries aren't as stable as they are in Germany and Netherlands.France for example is a country that can both be considered Mediternian and have a romanic culture. They're just fine. 

There are a lot of reasons why those countries are the way they are.History and geography being one of the main ones. There are probably others that are just as important. 

The economy is in a shit position right now and people resort to a form of tribalism in bad times. Greece is suffering more than anywhere,and some people feel a need to find a reason to direct their hate. You could even say that something similar happened to Germany in 1930. However,attributing that failure to Germans as a national value would have been factually wrong, and disgusting and amoral to do so. Why do it to others now?

There are probably a lot of people of German nationality or ethnicity that aren't trustworthy people, people that do bad things, and even some that commit crimes in other European countries. However, it would be silly to portray a whole group of people based on the actions of the few. The same way, there are a lot of Greek people that are hard-working, law-abiding people that do good things. 

For example, the case with the nazi flags and embassies. Those acts are seen in a negative way just as much in Germany as they are seen in Greece,or other country. (more or less,being that you remove the us vs them conflict side of it, and judge the acts by themselves). 

The fact is : The average German wants the same thing as the average Greek.They just didn't happen to be fortunate enough to have been born in a right place. 

When it comes to the Greek government, it's a work in progress, much the same as the whole of Eastern Europe.

Look at the data here: http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/dec/08/europe-working-hours

Let's take Greece for example. 

1st or 2nd in working hours, this would imply that it's not a cultural thing. They do work a lot. However, productivity is a lot lower.This is mainly due to the fact that they don't have the capital that allows for mass production and industralisation.Luxemburg on the other hand is among the lowest in working hours and highest in productivity. Same with most of the countries have a ""protestant work ethic"". 

It's really just an issue of economic development and at what stage of economic development each country is. It has nothing to do with culture or religion. 

Religion, and especially Protestanism may have had an influence in shaping the development of the countries you mention, but I don't think that anywhere in Europe religion has that social role and power anymore.

Edit: What you actually suggest is colonialism. The obligation for civilised countries to spread civilisation and the right word of God, culture,etc. 

What actually got all the western world to this level is the legal and economical system.Look at Korea,Japan,Australia,New Zealand, even USA and Canada developed because of this,not to mention the European countries. Perhaps other things may come into play, but those two things are absolutely essential : free market economics and democracy, rule of law.
 
What all of Eastern Europe,Greece and other Mediternian countries need is work on their economies ( with everything that entails), and work on the rule of law and democracy.

Ironically, this is what people from Western Europe want from those countries, and this is what residents of those countries want as well.Treating them as equals,helping and supporting them with that would go a long way, rather than trying to impose your own position and making prejudicial judgements on their culture,national values,etc. and attacking them. (this is where you can look at the UK)

true,cianisgood,null,null,"I can't belief this nonsense. The British army was deployed to protect nationalist area, but they immediately went about not doing that and allowed loyalists to enter and burn down nationalist areas. They were a completely partial force protecting loyalist will persecuting nationalist by searching and wreaking homes with out any evidence. They then shot down fourteen innocent catholic civil right protesters on Bloody Sunday, there are no incidences where the British army killed loyalist civilians which such prejudice, I am unaware of any incidences where the British purposefully killed loyalist civilians. 

The British army also had a local regiment, one they knew no Catholics would join, called the Ulster Defence Regiment.The Ulster Defence Regiment was a locally recruited regiment of the British Army. Almost all of the recruits came from the Protestant population. It also emerged that the UDR was actively colluding with loyalist death squads in the murders of individuals perceived as sympathetic to republicans. In an interview for a document entitled ""Subversion in the UDR"", a commander in the regiment admitted that about 15% of his men were also members of Loyalist death squads.

Such collusion became obvious following the Miami Showband Massacre. On the 31 July 1975 a popular Irish band were stopped by a fake British Army patrol and forced out of their van.The patrol was actually UVF members in UDR uniform. While being questioned, another group of UVF men attempted to place a bomb in the band's van but it exploded prematurely killing the two men who were carrying it. The rest of the UVF men then shot the band members, killing three of them, and fled. The next day it emerged that the two dead UVF men were in fact a Major and a Lietenant in the Ulster Defence Regiment.


There was also the B-specials a branch of the police who where completely loyalist/protestant and considered extremely sectarian even by members of the British army. They frequently opened fire on protests killing many civilians. 

All of this shows that the British army were far from impartial and favoured the loyalist community. The labelling of the British army as peacekeepers is laughable and only a lunatic could describe them as the good guys.
