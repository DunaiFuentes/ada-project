Iceland's population density is 37 times lower than Cyprus'. But I agree, they won't starve, they'll just move to Germany in search for work.

&gt; If no other plan is proposed by the EU-IMF, yes, they are pretty much forced to go down this road.

As far as I understood, the EU only wanted the Cypriots to find 5 billion ""anyway they like"", and left it to the Cypriots to handle the details. The Cyprus PM wanted everyone to share the burden, not just the rich people. It's ridiculous to blame this proposal on the EU-IMF, or saying that this is against the spirit of the Eurozone, when the Cypriots came up with the plan. No one forced them to do this, they could've just taxed the rich 75% like the French did.    
That is to say, of course there are other plans. Some people will have to pay, it's up to the Cypriots to decide how to balance the burden. I personally favor an egalitarian approach, but from /r/europe's history I'm sure this is unpopular and instead most people think the rich should pay more. The Cypriots themselves most certainly do think so.",1,1363723101,null,0,false,0,c8yn5tp,t3_1alx12,t1_c8yn5tp,t1_c8yms0k,null,1431637574,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1
true,mistyriver,null,null,"Germany, being the one which is providing the largest portion of the funding in these decisions has the preponderance of power in the bailout negotiations decided upon by the ""Troika."" Those in power, always have a greater measure of responsibility than those who are relatively powerless (in this case, those nations asking for help).

I would say that the core problem in the design of  these bailouts has been ethnocentrism. German policymakers repeatedly agree to (and in many cases, insist on) bail out terms which are driving the Mediterranean nations to the brink. My sense is the reason for this is that Germans have the idea in mind that all Occidental countries kind of have the same values and sensibilities that Germany does. 

Furthermore, I think it's quite gullible for the Germans to think that these other nations won't default on the loans being extended to them. Again here, I think the ethnocentrism of the driven, hard-working German mindset plays a part in blinding the policymakers.

Personally, I think that it will be a good day when the Mediterranean nations finally admit defeat in the face of past mistakes and begin to withdraw from the common currency, letting the pieces fall where they may (this will probably include defaulting on debts). I hope the example that Iceland has set will finally be taken seriously by others which face similar circumstances - like Cyprus.

Honestly, if European nations do not want to actually become a federation under the banner of a single European national government, I don't believe that a common currency is going to work out. The USA and Canada experience a constant flow of federal funds from rich parts of the country to poorer regions; I sort of think that's the natural state of affairs within a currency block. I agree with folks I saw on ZDF's ""Maybrit Illner"" show a week or two back about the need for these other poorer nations to be able to devalue a local currency in order to become economically competitive.",1,1363723104,null,0,1363724301,0,c8yn5v9,t3_1alm82,t1_c8yn5v9,t1_c8ym8kl,null,1431637578,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

**TRE (h3g)**
Tre (h3g) has good coverage in rome, until the ""GRA"" circular highway around the city. You can check the map zooming to rome: http://www.tre.it/assistenza/prodotti-e-servizi/copertura

If you have an h3g plan from another country you may use your current plan regarding data! 

I'm sorry the pages on the website of Tre are in italian only, but this is an example of a pay-to-go plan:
http://www.tre.it/opzioni/chiamate-ed-sms/all-in-medium
* 60 minutes of calls to everyone (in italy) per week
* 60 sms to everyone (in italy) per week
* 250 MB of traffic (under h3g coverage, no roaming) per week

**WIND**

Wind has interesting plans because they don't charge you for extra data: they slow you down to 32Kbps until the following month. 
Yes, that's KILOBITS, meaning 8Kbytes per second. 

I don't know exactly about Wind speed, but some friends were very unhappy about them.

http://www.wind.it/it/promo/pagina343.phtml?sez=RicaricabilePW&amp;prov=content

* All Inclusive Digital Special edition: 60 SMS, 60 minutes, 2 GB of data at full speed and then 32Kbps
* All the other plans have 1 GB of data at full speed 

**Telecom italia (TIM)**

Has the best coverage and the signal is so strong that they are probably frying our brains.

This plan has
http://www.tim.it/tariffe/ricaricabile/tutto-a-secondi-full-xl
* 100 minutes
* 100 sms
* 300 MB of traffic weekly, after you've expended it, you slow down to... yep, 32Kbps.

**PAY ATTENTION**

Most of those plans have to be bought in shops, bring some italian friend with you, in order to get the right plan. Most shops will try to make you subscribe recurring plans and give you a ""free phone"" (it's never free). Show your iphone 5, tell them you don't need another phone. :)

Pay in cash and don't forget to bring your papers with you, since they need a copy of your IDs to give you a number.

This goes to my very first point-- no outsider, official or not, has any right to impose their ""plan"" --in this case, one that is extremelly short-sighted, in its own right, at least to many leading economists-- on a democracy.

This is not an issue of Cypriots not willing to do sacrifices, it's an issue of them being forced into a false dillema, asking them for the manner in which they want to commit economic suicide.

If the IMF-EU fails to come up with a reasonable plan to propose (and they should have done so already), that is a sign of their incompetence alone, and no one else's.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I would say that the core problem in the design of these bailouts has been ethnocentrism. German policymakers repeatedly agree to (and in many cases, insist on) bail out terms which are driving the Mediterranean nations to the brink. My sense is the reason for this is that Germans have the idea in mind that all Occidental countries kind of have the same values and sensibilities that Germany does. 

And the alternative was what exactly? The thing is that German decision makers have tried to do the best what they can make from this situation. If they wouldn't have started to bailout countries it would have endangered the whole world economy and could have triggered depression. The idea is to make it into another day somehow.

&gt; Furthermore, I think it's quite gullible for the Germans to think that these other nations won't default on the loans being extended to them. Again here, I think the ethnocentrism of the driven, hard-working German mindset plays a part in blinding the policymakers.

That is actually something that policy makers do know, but can't say aloud. Finland for example has already protected itself by demanding collateral from Greece which actually consists from an insurance against Greek default, that was bit tricky for the Finnish state to organize, but they actually pooled it off.

&gt; Personally, I think that it will be a good day when the Mediterranean nations finally admit defeat in the face of past mistakes and begin to withdraw from the common currency, letting the pieces fall where they may (this will probably include defaulting on debts).

That defeat will mean that they abandon any hope of catching central and north European countries standard of living any time soon. Not to mention that brake up of the single currency would mean end of the European single market. There can be no single market without single currency. What growth prospect would southern European countries really have then?

&gt; . I hope the example that Iceland has set will finally be taken seriously by others which face similar circumstances - like Cyprus.

Iceland didn't default debts. What they did was to claim that Icelandic deposit insurance doesn't cover fully deposits made in foreign branches of their banks. This was later confirmed by EFTA court. Not to mention that Iceland needed loans from IMF and even then had to put up currency controls.

&gt; Honestly, if European nations do not want to actually become a federation under the banner of a single European national government, I don't believe that a common currency is going to work out. The USA and Canada experience a constant flow of federal funds from rich parts of the country to poorer regions; I sort of think that's the natural state of affairs within a currency block. I agree with folks I saw on ZDF's ""Maybrit Illner"" show a week or two back about the need for these other poorer nations to be able to devalue a local currency in order to become economically competitive.

Why? Estonia, Slovakia, Czech Republic etc... are growing fast and will over take old EU member states such as Greece, Cyprus and Portugal in GDP per capita states figures in the following decade. Why should more money be directed from richer countries to poorer ones if the poor ones are already catching up and fast? Not to mention that if EU would have more transfers, it would mean that countries such as Greece, Cyprus, Spain, etc... would also contribute to transfers, not be net recipients of them.

The alternative would have been to treat Cypriot bank failures as such, and for the EU to honour its obligations to make whole each EU citizen's account to the tune of €100.000. It disturbs me greatly that in all the news reports I've read over the weekend - both English language and German language ones - there has never been a bright line drawn in the analyses between the financial state of Cypriot banks and that of the Cyprus state. These should never be intertwined. The banks are private businesses, and the government is a public service entity.

I think that once that decision in Brussels was made to conflate the issues and to state that it wasn't a bank rescue but a wealth tax on every bank account, and thereby to justify a breach of the EU deposit insurance law, the die was cast - and no matter what Cyprus does over the next week or two... a run on the banks will ensue, causing great distress for the country.

Governments cannot decide to expropriate insured bank deposits - period, the end. When you do, people will begin lose faith in the banks, and then the outcome is quite predictable... people will take their money out, and store it elsewhere. This incurs a huge financial cost for the account insurer (usually, the national government).

2) Foreign business interests (Russians) have been placated.  There will be no levy.

3) The voter has been placated even though they don't know they've been screwed.

4) All public hatred transferred to ""Troika"" and Germany instead of their own politicians who are to blame.

Particularly of monopolies, thus putting a strong leash on the people. The German economy is flowing with cash! It has no liquidity problem. It's companies have no liquidity problem, on the contrary! They are spreading and buying. It's citizens have jobs and everything seems perfect. Sure, they contribute to the EU/EFSF, while complaining and imposing the silliest of terms which justifies the financial circus, but what it gives it takes back with the highest of interest rates and with the most positive of impact to German economy.

What the EZ and the IMF did was grant a loan that they believe Cyprus can still pay back someday, but not enough to save the entire banking sector. 

Now this puts politicians in Cyprus in tight spot, if they don't touch depositors under 100k, then they effectively destroy their whole banking sector by making all foreign depositors to abandon them in the future. Another option is to make everybody pay in a hope that foreign depositors aren't punished too much to make them leave meaning that the banking sector won't die.

Again, however, here we see the difficulty of a nation using a currency which it does not have ultimate control over. Frankly, I think the EU should insure deposits within the Eurozone, because:

1. Deposit insurance is important for the stability of the economy within the zone.

2. The ECB has the ability to simply print money if need be (aka. use ""quantitative easing"" strategies) in order to make account holders whole.

If the Cypriot pound was still the means of exchange on Cyprus the problem would be solvable (though the solution would be painful). As it is, the situation is not solvable without the intervention of Brussels.

We'll have to agree to disagree when it comes to our individual opinions about giving up and admitting defeat in the face of past mistakes. I think that to do this - and then to pick up the pieces and start again - is always a good bet, because it's a gesture of honesty to yourself and others.

Yes and it is more than needed because SEPA will enable national European banks eventually to become truly pan European banks, the associated risks will be far too wide then for any member state to carry. However the problem with creating European deposit insurance fund is that different countries have different risks and these needs to be taken into account when defining how much different banks need to contribute to the fund. Not to mention that in many countries there really isn't any real insurance fund, thus many member states and their banks couldn't afford to move into a European deposit insurance fund.

&gt; The ECB has the ability to simply print money if need be (aka. use ""quantitative easing"" strategies) in order to make account holders whole.

The problem with this is that there is the moral hazard for states not to fix problems. For example if the ECB could have printed money and handed it down to Spain, that would only have postponed the recession because there are actually some upper limits on how many useless airports and empty motorways a country needs.

&gt; If the Cypriot pound was still the means of exchange on Cyprus the problem would be solvable (though the solution would be painful). As it is, the situation is not solvable without the intervention of Brussels.

They could either decide to save all the foreign depositors and save the banking sector, this could only be done by a major devaluation that would make every Cypriot much poorer. If they decided not to sacrifice their own citizens, then they would be finished as an banking hub.

&gt;  The banking sector is already destroyed by the poor judgment of the bankers themselves. Anyone who has a good sum of money in the bank (is not a ""Kleinsparer"" with funds less than €100.000) knows the risks they're taking as an investor in the institution, they probably have other wealth elsewhere in the world, and thus they can probably bear the brunt of a bank failure and their money being lost.

true,Inclol,SWED,Sweden,"The circumstances were quite different in the case of post WWII Germany. This since the allies both wanted to keep the western part of Germany in the western fold as well as to prevent both the Soviets and even more German Revanchism.

I can't agree that the problems are the same, the bank bubbles in Spain and Ireland, the debt crisis in Greece and Portugal as well as the stagnating Italian economy (and soon to be the frensh) are all casued by domestic policies.
 I doubt anything will be done with the terms, I mean the moral hazzard is just far to great and the public in northern Euro zone contries  will not accept to hand over their money. When a small county like Finland is told that it might have to pay for a huge disaster such as Spain I can get that they're pissed. This especially since the South has been living of regional funds and CAP since the 80-s and still can't manage to reform. 

Of course they should pay but we both know that they are conneted to the corrupt politicians (the all are) that it won't ever happen. Also Greek ship owners are exempt from taxes in your constitution..

You don't need to liberalise every sector and I agree that doing it to trains services is a bad Idea, though that being said no one will buy TRAINOSE anyway. 
But as an example; a greek laywer living in Athens can't take custormers living in Thessaloniki due to regional Guilds and that is absured since it means higher prices for the consumer and is a breach of EU common market statues. It is the same in a lot of sectors, both taxis and the damn truck drivers comes to mind, in total I think it is 90 sectors. I mean almost everything in Greece is as expensive as in northern Europé due to cartels (food stores), Guilds (transport) and the unions (fakilaki). 

Of couse they are corrupt I take that for granted (wich is why I didn't mention it). The rest of Europé simply does not trust Greek politicians which is partly why the troika is there so often. I mean the politicians have yet to close a single major del in privatizations and they are supposed to raise 50 billions from it. On top of that the state don't even know what/ how much land it owns since there is no land register..

Now I gotta get some sleep :)

Ti riporto qualche informazione per orientarti a Bologna specifica per gli studenti:

**Arrivare a Bologna:**

Visto che arrivi dagli USA, suppongo che verrai in aereo. A seconda della compagnia aerea che sceglierai, potresti dover fare scalo a Parigi, Londra, Monaco o Roma. L'aeroporto di Bologna ""G. Marconi (codice BLQ) è a circa 7km dal centro della città. Puoi raggiungere la città dall'aeroporto con un autobus speciale che si chiama ""[Aerobus](http://www.atc.bo.it/orari/aerobus)"". Il biglietto costa €6 e ti porta in centro città. In alternativa puoi prendere un taxi, che costerà circa €15 (o anche €20-25 di notte). L'aerobus non fa servizio nelle ore notturne.

**Moversi a Bologna**:

I bus pubblici funzionano bene e sono discretamente puntuali. Il biglietto costa €1.50 fatto a bordo e mi pare €1.20 se lo compri in edicola. Il centro storico di Bologna e le zone immediatamente limitrofe sono ben servite dagli autobus.

**Trovare casa e vivere a Bologna**:

Bologna è una città universitaria, per cui c'è una gran giro di affitti e subaffitti. A seconda delle tue preferenze (singola o doppia) e del quartiere che scegli, l'affitto può venire a costare fra i €200 e €400. A questa cifra devi aggiungere le spese di elettricità/acqua/metano. Visto che sei straniero qualcuno potrebbe cercare di approfittare di te, stai attento a quello che ti propongono. Molti studenti affittano ""in nero"" (cioè senza contratto) per evadere le tasse: è vero che si risparmia un po', ma sei anche senza diritti legali, per cui ti consiglio di cercare di scegliere un padrone di casa che ti offra un regolare contratto. Per cercare casa puoi usare siti come [Kijiji.it](http://www.kijiji.it/case/stanze-e-posti-letto/annunci-bologna/offerte/) e [Subito.it](http://www.subito.it/annunci-emilia-romagna/affitto/camere-posti-letto/bologna/). Troverai anche tantissimi volantini affissi su tutte le pareti delle vie universitarie (come via Zamboni) e all'interno dei dipartimenti. Non so se l'università offre posti letto in studentato per gli studenti stranieri, controlla su http://www.unibo.it

Bologna è una bella città, non troppo grande e davvero molto viva, soprattutto per gli studenti universitari. Tieni conto dei suggerimenti nella nostra FAQ (guarda nella colonna a destra) e goditi la permanenza. Se hai domande particolari chiedi pure.

true,mistyriver,null,null,"&gt; They could either decide to save all the foreign depositors and save the banking sector, this could only be done by a major devaluation that would make every Cypriot much poorer.

I have to disagree that devaluation of a currency necessarily makes a nation poorer. Yes, it does make importing foreign goods more expensive, and for a small nation in an increasingly globalised world where important consumer goods are being made halfway around the world, that can be a hardship. However, devaluation also allows exports to bring back a king's ransom from international buyers. Do you know that China has a big national celebration every year where they review the export figures to the USA and other nations abroad? It's a hugely beneficial thing for that country, that their government has sought to undervalue the Renminbi over the course of the past decade or two.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"This is a very interesting situation, it seems to me. Periphery countries have always had access to a self-destruct button for the single currency. If one country leaves the Euro, the prospect of further countries leaving the Euro becomes a possibility. Asset holders in those countries, not wanting their assets to be valued in newly devalued national currencies, will move their capital elsewhere, causing bank runs, and financial collapse. That makes countries leaving the Euro more likely, for the same reason that Cyprus would want to leave, and start printing its own currency: in order to finance its government and shore up its economy. And any banks that collapse will incur huge losses for its creditors, not just within the country, but throughout the system and across national borders. The problem feeds back onto itself in multiple ways. Cyprus is able to kick a pebble down the hill, and start a landslide.

Up to now the core countries have dictated terms, but Cyprus appears to be the first country which is actually calling their bluff. Cyprus has initiated a count-down to leaving the currency, and now is in a strong position to dictate its own terms. And if they do manage to get a favourable deal, it will change the negotiating positions of all other periphery countries. The core must decide, whether to stump up the cash, and to some extent accept the ongoing principle of fiscal transfers, or whether to let the Euro collapse inwards. 

Ultimately, how much is the single currency worth to Germany, and its fellow travellers?

For the UK to take on all Cypriot debt, to manage an orderly exit of the Euro, to consolidate its working finance sector (and do what needs to be done).  If in a few years they want independence from the UK a second time, then they'll hopefully have a Norwegian style resource to pay off their share of the debt - and maybe get the independence transition right a second time around since it went so badly wrong last time.

The IMF-EZ have proposed a bailout, the Russians no doubt will be extending the same offer they did to Greece, why shouldn't the UK throw its hat into the ring?  

Couldn't do it with a much bigger country, but Cyprus, yeah - there's SDRs and RBS shares to ditch for one off funds, and borrowing is still comparatively low.  A new tax haven, nice climate, finance infrastructure looking to reorganise, the first EU port after Suez, with the potential of a nice return on same gas contracts.  Could be a win-win for everybody.  Might even sort out the Turkey problem peacefully and once and for all if they did choose to do it.  Have a do-over and be independent again in 5years or so, if they wish (Falklands, Gib and Bermuda don't want to leave), without any of the hurt they're now facing.  Even don't go down the UK route; possibly go down a straight and fresh Commonwealth route.  Maybe it should be a collective Commonwealth hat thrown into the ring sharing the burden out of solidarity.  They're a member.

&gt;Did the Cypriots - their parliament - make a grave mistake today? One that's dangerous for the rest of the Eurozone as well?

We acknowledge the decision with regret. Cyprus itself applied for an assistance program. And for such a program we need a predictable way for Cyprus to regain access to financial markets. For this their debts, their liabilities are too high, in proportion to their GDP, 17 billion, so everyone's been saying this has to be reduced. And in such a case, when the threat of insolvency is looming, the creditors are to be involved. And if we want to avoid that, then the investors are to make an appropriate contribution. If that's a bail-in or a tax on assets - that's something for Cyprus itself to decide, but without a sustainable basis there there's no negotiation over an assistance program.

&gt;And if that doesn't happen, if Cyrus were to enter bankruptcy on it's own volition, how dangerous would that be for the rest of the Eurozone?

Well, we're a lot more stable in the Eurozone, we've set up measures in all countries to combat the danger of contagion. The Greek banking system has become much more stable due to their assistance program... So I won't even hear of it, it's a serious situation, but it can't lead to us making a decision that makes no sense. That'd shore up a business model that's not successful... Cyprus has a banking sector that has low taxes and favorable legal environment which is completely overdrawn and because of that Cyprus is insolvent. And no-one outside of Cyprus is to blame for that, it's simply that the business model is not viable, it has to be restructured, there's no other way. And that's what those responsible in Cyprus should tell their people - that the people are out protesting is understandable, we have to remain calm in the face of it and [?] sensibly but that can not lead to us making unreasonable, irresponsible decisions. 

&gt;And in Cyprus, as we've become aware, you've been made a scapegoat for those under 100.000 being involved in the losses? That was a Cypriot decision... why do you think the government made such a fatal step?

I believe that the Cypriot government thinks it can keep on attracting large investors, same as until now now. The economy is based on foreign capital flowing to Cyprus.

&gt;So that they attract oligarchs by fleecing small savers?

Calling them oligarchs is already a judgment. Large investors. With favorable taxes and other legal frameworks. And they'd love to keep it. But as this business model simply isn't functioning anymore
 - Cyprus has effectively had no access to financial markets since fall 2011, the rating agencies have set them at junk, the two largest banks in Cyprus are insolvent, and that's something that no-one outside of Cyprus carries blame for. That business model doesn't work and that's something someone has to explain to the people of Cyprus, that there's no other way, that if this crisis is to be solved this is the cause that has to be counteracted.

&gt;So what happens when nothing happens? I've read that by June Cyprus has to somehow find a billion euros and that's not doable in present conditions. Will Cyprus be bankrupt in June?

Such speculations always sound like threats. Currently the situation is as follows: the banks are closed...

&gt;The won't stay that way, certainly?

Both of the larger banks are living exclusively off emergency liquidity through the central bank and the ECB has made it clear that if there is no program, no assistance program, then that liquidity can not be forthcoming. And that's also something to be explained. These are difficult circumstances, and I don't think it'll take until July, I think it's critical whether the banks can be opened at all, as those two banks are without emergency liquidity completely insolvent.",0,1363741530,null,0,false,0,c8ytn1f,t3_1amk1o,t1_c8ytn1f,t1_c8ys4mt,null,1431640622,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15

One thing to note is that the idea that everyone, everywhere, is always ""blaming the Germans"" is something that is also somewhat fostered by the media, which seems to go out of their way to find the one sign that mentions Merkel amongst thousands of others.

This is because it makes better news, and also because I seem to detect a certain pattern of victimisation of Germany, for one, and a sort of revanchism, for other, in the way that things are portrayed.

I haven't followed in great detail the reaction in Cyprus, but as for the rest of your comment let me assure you that around here the vast majority of people are well aware that the fault falls entirely upon themselves. Time is more than ready to put an end to this Euro experience, EU-wide trading agreements, etc, etc, I'm sure that everbody would survive and would mean less drama.

Dati presi dalle pagine 1 e 2 di [questo](http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/brisante-daten-die-maer-von-den-klammen-krisenstaaten/7931578.html) articolo del [Handelsblatt](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handelsblatt), giornale economico tedesco]

Secondo il giornale della Commerzbank gli italiani avrebbero un patrimonio mediano di 164000 euro (con immobili, senza debiti), più alto* rispetto a quello di un austriaco o un tedesco (circa 76000), e che il patrimonio privato italiano è pari al 173% del nostro debito (i tedeschi hanno solo il 124%), quindi in teoria saremmo solvibili. 

L'istituto tedesco di ricerca per l'economia ([DIW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Institute_for_Economic_Research)) afferma che con una tassa patrimoniale una tantum del 15% sui depositi scenderemmo sotto la soglia critica del 100% di debito in relazione al PIL.

Secondo uno studio del DIW su base dei dati OCSE del 2012, gli italiani tra il 2007 e il 2009 avrebbero avuto in media il 555,6% del PIL nazionale, mentre nello stesso arco di tempo i francesi il 509,6 e i tedeschi il 394,4%. Gli espertoni ne conseguono che non deve stupire che la massa dei soldi posseduti sia molto più alta del nostro debito, e la Franfurter Allgemeine Zeitung aggiunge che certi Paesi in crisi hanno patrimoni maggiori di quelli con economie forti.

*
 dato che in Germania e Austria la **media** è molto più alta (a causa delle forti disparità economiche tra strati sociali) rispetto che in Italia, pare si sia deciso di riportare solitamente solo le cifre **mediane** quando vengono forniti e comparati i dati in diverse nazioni: se si calcolasse la media aritmetica austriaca questa salirebbe a 265000 euro


----

**finto TL;DR**: Si dice che l'Italia avrebbe il grano necessario a risolvere i propri cazzi, se solo si accettasse un prelievo forzoso del 15%. 

Ma dato che i 2000+miliardi di debito che abbiamo ci stanno schiacciando, e che come terza economia del continente ancora non uscita dalla crisi non possiamo più permetterci di essere una mina vagante, c'è un urgente bisogno di riforme, e nel malaugurato caso dovessimo avere ancora bisogno del paracadute (103 miliardi già scuciti da Draghi) prosciugheremmo i fondi stanziati dall'Unione e contestualmente peggioreremmo anche i conti dei Paesi che vi partecipano e che vedrebbero alzarsi i tassi dei prestiti del danaro che devono procurarsi sul mercato.

Insomma niente di nuovo. Bisogna vedere se ci converrebbe strappare il cerotto in un colpo o operare tagli per almeno 50 miliardi/anno per i prossimi venti anni

In the modal sense, that is, denoting something which must occur, *have to* is almost always a perfect substitute, identical in meaning with *must*. That use is really common, at least in America, but it's still idiomatic, so it's not really classified with other modal verbs, and the meanings diverge in some weird edge cases (e.g. ""he must've gone to the bathroom"" =/= ""he had to go to the bathroom"")

The can/could thing... it's hard for me to explain because there are so many shades of meaning in *could*, depending on the context. 

*Can* is pretty straightforward - it means the ability to do something at the present, with the focus on the ability. ""He can lift a car"" = he is able to do it right now.

*Could* can be the subjunctive form of can, meaning that the ability would appear if some condition were met. It can also mean the same thing as *can*, but with a softer or more polite connotation. I'd say ""we could go to the mall"" or ""I could drive"" as polite suggestions; *can* could be used in either of those, but it's more direct.

It's not an unquestionably good decision to leave to Euro — it's going to cause a *lot* of trouble for Cyprus to do so. If they deem that it's less trouble than actually going through with the requested reforms, that's their choice, but it's not an easy choice to make.

Most likely, a reversal to the Cypriot Pound out of necessity to pay off debts will result in a massive devaluation of the Cypriot economy, causing investors to flee the country and significantly reducing the country's ability to import common goods from the rest of Europe, in turn lowering the standard of living on the island.

From a British perspective, the story is always framed as a question of sovereignty, but the fact is that the core countries are making quite reasonable demands for a bailout that they're sponsoring out of their own pocket. Granted, they're not interested in seeing an economic meltdown in Cyprus, because it means that debts owned by banks in their countries will be hit hard, but it isn't Merkel's fault that Cyprus and other countries took irresponsible loans.

EU-wide banking regulation is the only long-term way to avoid this problem in the future — actually I'd say that's more important than shared financial policy.

EDIT: Oh, and I forgot: Who's to say that all creditors will agree to convert their debt to Cyprus Pounds instead of keeping it as Euros?

It's not that Cyprus leaving the Euro would necessarily be a good thing either for Cyprus or for the remaining countries, but that the threat of their ability to torpedo the Euro can be deployed to get them a better bailout deal. It's a game of chicken, basically.

Whether this is a fair thing to do is quite subjective. Arguably in this case the strength of your negotiating position is strongly tied in with fairness. There are huge competitiveness advantages for Germany, and particularly the German export industry, in being part of a currency union with the periphery, and apparently some commensurate loss in competitiveness for the periphery. In other countries, depressed areas remain part of the currency in exchange for fiscal transfers. This is arguably an issue of fairness which comes before the periphery's simple duty to pay its debts.

All of this does come down to whether Cyprus leaving the Euro actually has the power to seriously destabilize the single currency. I don't think that other vulnerable countries would necessarily be able to look dispassionately at the consequences of a hypothetical Cyprus departure, because in those circumstances they will be suffering capital flight and financial collapse. I think they would be forced out, not be able to choose. At least, I always assumed this is why anyone in a position of responsibility is so strong about the single currency being irreversible.

true,anocrazybear,null,null,"More than half newborns in France are outside the bond of marriage. So PACS is a legal option introduced in 1999 for couples living together. 
From a legal pov, marriage is also a frameset to solve issues when things go bad. PACS was conceived with a similar logic but less protective and binding than a Marriage. 

A simple case: lets say you live together, and the lease is on partner A. Let's say partner A died, the lease is transferred to the PACS partner B. Where as if there was no PACS, partner B would have to leave, or  sign a new contract.

PACS shares with marriage some features:

- taxes: the new couple can start  filling taxes together. 

- there is some recognition of ""a will"", if something bad happened. Although I am not sure your partner could decide for you in cases where you are in a coma [unlike marriage, where the full authority is yours].

- there is the living together set of rules, that apply for loans [if your partner buys a fridge on credit, you are also responsible of the loan, unless the fridge is some fancy bs]. Same as Marriage.

But, it is **not** Marriage. For example it lacks the divorce protection. A PACS can be voided by simply mutual consent or unilaterally with a simple letter from the bailiff. Where as in a Marriage, a judge would assess if the mutual consent is real, or if there is some kind of pressure that would require him to protect the weaker partner. 

Statistically, the [PACS is overwhelmingly used by heterosexual couples](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=NATTEF02327) [its a 20 to 1!!!]. **Edit**: as you can see, the number of marriages is stable and twice the number of PACS, so it is not viewed as a substitute for marriage, but is quite popular.

For Homosexual couples, things get messy and difference with Marriage is more clear. For example if one of them has a child; since obviously, the other partner can't  be the biological father/mother, the PACS doesn't give him an adoptive status over the child. So if one partner dies, the other can't claim custody. There are cases where the partner wouldn't be allowed to take the kids back from school. This is less an issue, in **not yet married** heterosexual couples, since he is the biological parent [otherwise one would cast serious doubts on the validity of them living together in a PACS].

You guys are already 'printing' more money than you may have to print to help Cyprus out anyway, and it can be spun as a positive thing for the GBP anyway following what has happened so far. Picture it: Cyprus seeks refuge from the evil euro by temporarily switching to the British Pound. Nigel Farage's boner will be visible from satellite photos.

You guys are one of the 3 **guarantors of Cyprus' sovereignty** anyway, so it's not as weird as it sounds. It seems that giving up some of the gas rights is on the table right now.. Why not the UK? Does it really have to be Russia? Make an offer, damn you :P

edit: This is actually an important observation -&gt; The UK has been suspiciously quiet (compared to normal) regarding these developments. I believe that they ultimately have the biggest voice (and always had, if they choose to use it) regarding Cyprus for reasons that are not even related to anti-euro sentiment.

Possible benefits:

A) UK committed to saving bank deposits -- confidence boost (this will likely pay for itself) -- likely will make the EU look like knobs as far as banking goes after such a powerful (yet relatively cheap) gesture.

B) Turn the current anti-european feeling in Cyprus into a pro-british feeling.

C) Profits a few years down the line from gas (depending on what sort of deal you arrange)

D) Safeguarding the British bases in Cyprus and making sure the Russians don't cut into your action on that front.

E) Since it's obvious that Cyprus bank investments cannot go too heavy into Greece (which is what started this), they can diversify by buying British government debt as well. Though theoretically, the cypriot banks will likely be owned by british banks at this point anyway (I doubt the banks as they are right now will survive this PR nightmare) ;)

F) Brings a solution to the good ol' Cyprus problem a step closer since an economic collapse will make this issue worse, but now with the UK at the table (something which should have happened a long time ago anyway....

A classic case of getting from the frying-pan into the fire, if you ask me.

Cyprus is a case of bad political management on so many fronts that it's not easily repairable and the clowns who now run the show over there aren helpful either.

It is also ironic to observe that the EU is in this trouble due to too few possibilities by other member states to reign in rogue states like Cyprus due to the sovereignty discussion. It puts it again in stark perspective that any country who wants to be a member of the EU has to forfeit on some aspects of it's sovereignty, especially on those aspects which are economy related.

Oh, and anyone who thinks that the Cypriot Banks will be alive and upright after an eurexit of Cyprus lives in la-la-land in my opinion since the main attraction to place foreign money in Cyprus is that the currency is hard (euro) and no questions are asked.

The problem is that one of their main banks is currently insolvent and will collapse on its next working day. This will drag the rest of the banks with them, and the Cypriot government lacks the required 30 billion euro to guarantee the deposits under 100k.

The Minister of Finance and Public Administration, Cristobal Montoro, has advanced on Tuesday that the government will impose a type ""moderate"" to bank deposits to compensate communities that saw their tax autonomy canceled after the Executive created a state tax 0% rate. This tax on bank deposits, which has nothing to do with Cyprus, does not affect savers but requires credit institutions to pay for that capture deposits.

""The autonomous communities receive timely and therefore financially compensation shall implement a moderate rate in the state tax on bank deposits,"" said the minister, adding that this kind ""will not be much higher than 0%"" .

The Minister of Finance has clarified that such ""moderate"" will have no tax collection effort, ""but that these regions serve to offset the revenue loss to see."" So, he assured that the amount will correspond to the amount ""exact has been undermined by the cancellation of regional taxes"".

It will not be the case of Asturias, where the tax on deposits was approved by the regional budget law, while ""Spanish law prohibits the adoption of this mode"" stressed Montoro. During the questioning of Senator Francisco Fuentes Socialist Group Gallardo, Montoro explained that communities of Extremadura, Andalusia and the Canary Islands, which were in force when the tax came into effect on state ""receive timely compensation, which will resulting from the implementation a moderate to state tax rate. ""

Montoro has stressed that the Central Government is preparing a proposal on the amounts to be paid to travel to the affected communities ""in the relevant joint committee"" with the affected communities. ""That is the Government's intention and hope that through political dialogue can establish an agreement,"" said.

Has advanced further the Government's intention to reduce delays for this compensation count as income to the budget.

Meanwhile, Sen. Gallardo Fuentes Extremadura has quantified what will stop collecting the three affected regions in 2013, once in force the 0% of the Government, amounting to 230 million euros in 2013. Specifically, Extremadura lose 39 million euros, 96 million Canary Islands and Andalusia, 95.5 million. Besides, you corresponerían Asturias 30 million.

The Government announced in November 2012 the creation of a tax on bank deposits with type 0%, with implementation on 1 January 2013, to prevent the regions implement your own. A week earlier, the Constitutional Court had endorsed the tax on deposits of Extremadura, which launched in 2001 and turned in the day the government of José María Aznar.

Thus, this tax was in force before the imposition of the 0% and in the case of Andalusia, the Canary Islands in 2010 and established, who created it in June 2012. Only after it established Asturias. So this type Montoro 0% justified by the need to standardize the tax system and maintain the unity of the internal market, after the European Commission will send a letter to the Government on the grounds that these taxes in the regions could violate the free movement of capital.

I know that the economy of Cyprus will at first be destroyed by that measure. But I believe it will recover. New banks will emerge that work more cautiously and the debt holders will also be more careful who they lend to. Overall this would lead to a more responsible way of doing business.

My greatest concern with this way of solution is, that it may be too late. This strategy should have been imposed in 2008, when the crisis started. People's saving should have been rescued up to 100,000€. All the other debt of the banks would have been paid out partially with the assets of the bank. The biggest losers would be the shareholders and the employees of the banks. But there would still be banks around which will carry on the business with private customers and other businesses.

Mais la représentation du Mâle héroïque, stoïque, baraqué, qui sauve la demoiselle en détresse participe, sur le long terme, à la construction de nos clichés y compris sur nous-même.

Pour le reste, il y a tellement de choses à dire sur r/seduction et sur le fameux ""game"".... désolé, ça risque d'être long.

Ce qui suit tente une synthèse de tout ce que j’ai pu lire sur le sub (qui s’appelle aussi « seddit »). En deux mots : bullshit sexiste.


* **La séduction, c’est une affaire de mecs :** Le plus frappant, déjà, c’est que sur un sub nommé « seduction » on ne parle en fait qu’aux mecs, jamais aux femmes. Le présupposé est simple : les femmes n’ont pas à draguer, elles n’en ont pas besoin, et c’est cette injustice fondamentale qui est à la base de seddit. Cette inégalité engendre un profond ressentiment. Je me souviens avoir vu un topic où une femme tentait d’expliquer que pour elles, c’était également très compliqué d’avoir des mecs, notamment parce qu’elles ne savaient pas toujours si elles étaient jolies ou non, intéressantes ou non, et que donc elles se trouvaient aussi dans une situation frustrante et difficile à supporter d’un point de vue estime de soi. Torrent de réponse des utilisateurs mâles : non, c’est faux, les femmes ne galèrent pas, ou alors pas autant que nous, pauvres hommes désarmés.


* **Mâles Alpha et mâles Béta** : C’est le cœur de toute la séduction qui s’étale sur r/seduction. L’Alpha, que tous les aspirants « pick-up artists » (PUA) veulent être est tout simplement le mâle dominant. Parce qu’il dégage un charisme, la confiance en soi et, finalement, de la force, les femmes le préfèrent, et tous les mecs doivent vouloir devenir ce mâle Alpha. Le mâle Alpha peut avoir toutes les filles, et donc toutes les filles le veulent.

**=&gt; Ce que ça dit sur la vision de l’homme :** Le mythe du mâle alpha compare explicitement l’homme à un animal et la séduction à une compétition, où il faut être le plus performant pour espérer pouvoir coucher avec les plus jolies femmes. Il définit aussi un canon masculin vers lequel tout le monde devrait tendre : musclé (hé oui ! le premier conseil c’est toujours de se muscler, ironique pour ceux qui prétendent développer le « inner game »), buveur, social, fort, qui ne plie pas devant les « shit test » (j’en reparlerai plus loin), qui se fait remarquer, qui remet les autres mecs à leur place et qui démontre une certaine frivolité (cad « qui drague tout ce qui bouge »). Le mâle Alpha est un prédateur et un conquérant, tandis que le mâle Béta, celui qui ne se conforme pas à cette vision ultra-stéréotypée de l’homme, est voué à l’échec et doit absolument se sortir de sa condition pour accéder, enfin, à l’alpha-type.

**=&gt; Ce que ça dit sur la vision de la femme :** Le mythe du mâle Alpha réduit les femmes à des animaux qui obéiraient à des instincts primaires inconscients et universels : ici la recherche du chef de meute. Les femmes sont la « cible » des mâles, elles sont à la fois un objectif à atteindre et un obstacle à surmonter. Elles sont la juste récompense du winner. Elles doivent être « dressées » (« tamed » revient très souvent dans les discussions !). Je pense que c’est le pire dans la théorie du mâle alpha, finalement, cette vision paternaliste, méprisante, objectifiante, faisant des femmes des victimes en puissance tout comme des castratrices potentielles (lorsqu’elles se refusent aux mâles Alpha).


* **Notation/objectification des femmes :** Bien évidemment, les femmes n’existent pas vraiment. Elles se réduisent en fait à leur note. Il suffit de lire un field report (les topics balisés [FR] sur le sub), les « retours d’expérience » pour le constater : le Mâle Alpha wannabe parle de ces cibles en termes de « HB » pour « Hot body » suivi d’une note de 1 à 10. Je pense qu’il n’y a pas plus révélateur : sur reddit, quand on parle seduction sur le sub seduction, on ne parle pas de femmes, on parle d’un corps noté de 1 à 10. 


* **Se défendre face aux femmes :** Sur r/seduction, les femmes ne sont pas seulement un objectif, elles sont aussi des adversaires. Partout, on conseille aux mecs de ne pas céder, de montrer qu’on est le plus fort, de ne pas se laisser avoir par les « shit test », c’est-à-dire les questions posées par les femmes destinées à « piéger » les mecs ou, pire, à les soumettre. Un « shit test », c’est par exemple « Est-ce que tu penses qu’on a un avenir tous les deux ? » Répondre « oui », c’est devenir le mec soumis qui doit renoncer à sa liberté d’étalon fou, répondre « non » c’est s’exposer à des reproches constants de la part de la femme visant à le réduire au silence. Ce n’est en aucun cas parce que la femme veut sincèrement connaître la réponse, elle est un adversaire ! On entretien évidemment le mythe de la femme compliquée et pénible. Ah, et bien sûr, on ne parle jamais des « shit test » que font passer les mecs. Un mec ne fait pas passer de « shit test », puisque c’est un mec.


* **Dominer les femmes :** Là on se trouve à la limite de la culture du viol. Sur seddit, les deux coexistent à la marge, et je trouve ça particulièrement inquiétant. Ça m’a notamment frappé lorsque j’ai lu, sur un topic consacré au « seduction moves », un PUA conseiller de **mettre la main sur la gorge d’une fille dans une mimique d’étranglement (mais sans serrer)** parce que ça exciterait les femmes. Je peux concevoir qu’il y ait des rapports différents à la domination, surtout dans la séduction. Mais je n’arrive pas à croire que l’on conseille ça comme un geste à tenter *avant même de connaître quoi que ce soit des envies de la femme en face*. Globalement, la partie « sexe » (oui, évidemment, il y a des conseils pour le pieu, vous en doutiez ?) est un concentré de ces attitudes : il faut « diriger », il faut être « ferme », il faut « montrer clairement ses désirs » au risque sinon… d’être catalogué comme un mâle Béta, évidemment.


Pour toutes ces raisons, seddit me terrifie, autant sur la vision qu’il donne des mecs que sur celle qu’il donne des femmes. 

TL;DR : sur r/seduction, les mecs sont des prédateurs et les femmes sont soit des corps soit des ennemis.

GDP: What your country produces over the course of a year. Food, clothes, machinery, shops, services, everything is included. It doesn't have to be a thing you can touch with your hands. Austria had a €300bn GDP in 2011. It's like 300.000 people having €1.000.000 each.

Bank Assets: What banks have plus what banks claim they have. They don't always have all the money they claim they do. They give more money to people, hoping they will get even more over time. Countries that are not able to have a large industry, might offer cheaper loans and better savings rates for people doing business with them. Austria's bank assets for 2011 were the equivalent of 1.000.000 people having €1.000.000 each.

Assets to GDP: You compare what the banks say they have with what each country says it produces, and you see how many times the first is bigger. Austria's banks said that in 2011, they had roughly 3 times more money than what Austria produced in 2011.

Assets to Capital: You compare what the banks say they have with what they have at a moment's notice, and you see how many times the first is bigger. Austria's banks said that in 2011, they had 11 times more money than what they could find immediately.

Let banks fail and watch mortgages dry up.  Great you might think: cheaper houses.  Not so great if you are one of the many regular Joes just trying to go to work and look after your family.  You're now in the realms of negative equity paying for a house that's worth a fraction of the mortgage, and that's before the office/factory starts laying off people because they too used these banks and have had their monthly credit cut off, which means they no longer have equity but a cash flow problem.  That's the death knell of any business, even profitable ones.  A big pay day in June means nothing if you have to get to May.  

So now our regular Joe has negative equity on his house, employers are making cuts, prices are rising by desperate retailers and providers, who haven't been the first to go under, fighting from going under.  So he's no longer making mortgage repayments.  Now they're foreclosing on him and debt management is moving in.  There's no more business start ups because the remaining banks are clawing liquidity back with every gasp of their lungs.

Services aren't operating the way they should.  Councils don't keep their budgets in mattresses.  It's in the same banks and banks are folding.  So the streets aren't being cleaned, rubbish isn't being collected and is piling up in the streets.  Extend to most council workers and their services.  People aren't getting paid on time.  People are striking.  There's unresolvable union action competing against other unions.

Banks are screwed but the bankers in a position have taken flight and protected themselves.  They have personal contingency plans.  They, along with big business, take flight, it's Regular Family Joe that's stuck in a country in a death spiral with no way out.   

So yeah, the principled approach is to let banks fail, but it's a Pyrrhic victory.  Overseas acquisition companies swoop in and carve up the meat left on the bones and the bank wealth is redistributed to other big businesses and governments, but it's the guy in the street that actually loses everything.  Avoiding a moral hazard sounds great until it means not putting food in a child's belly.

It's not being soft on banks; it's just that the time for rules and degrees of separation between them and the harm can do to others has already passed by this late stage.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Na, du bist hier mit Israel gekommen, was ja nichts mit der Beschneidungsdebatte zu tun hat. Auch wenn du sicherlich irgendwo irgendein Zitat eines israelischen Staatsbediensteten findest, der sich dazu geäußert hast. Aber die Erlaubnis oder das Verbot von Beschneidung in Deutschland hat erst einmal nichts mit Israel zu tun. Du vermengst Judentum und Israel, und das ist die klassische Argumentation von modernen Antisemiten (auch wenn ich dir das ausdrücklich *nicht* vorwerfe.)

Ich verstehe immer noch nicht woher der Mythos kommt man dürfe die israelische Politik und Menschenrechtsverletzungen nicht kritisieren. Das wird doch laufend gemacht? Die UNO publiziert dazu, Jakob Augstein ist einer der beliebtesten Kolumnisten des Landes, Möllemann hat damit Stimmenpotenziale für die FDP geweckt, Günter Grass bekam von vielen Seiten Beifall und eine Seite ganz vorne in der Süddeutschen. Wenn man keine Kritik äußern dürfte wäre das doch alles nicht möglich. 

Womit man halt nur rechnen muss wenn man sich öffentlich äußert, ist dass es Leute mit einer anderen Meinung gibt, die sich dann ebenfalls dazu äußern. Den Gegenwind muss man ertragen, genau wie ich deinen Gegenwind jetzt gerne ertrage. Ich stelle mich jetzt jedenfalls nicht hin und sage ""Man darf Israelkritiker offenbar nicht kritisieren, sonst kommt sofort die Auschwitzkeulekeule.""

Es gibt nur halt Kritik an Handlungen Israels und es gibt ""Israelkritik"". Und die ist meines Erachtens anders gestrickt als andere Kritik. Sie wirft Israel (und implizit oft ""den Juden"") vor den Holocaust für ihre Zwecke auszubeuten, sie vergleicht Israel mit dem Dritten Reich, sie wendet Doppelstandards an auf die Handlungen der IDF und, beispielsweise, der Hamas. Das ist die ""Israelkritik"", die in /r/worldpolitics/ weit verbreitet ist. Schlimme Bilder von getöteten palästinensischen Kindern kriegen 1000 Upvotes, UNO-Berichte dass diese Kinder von Hamas-Raketen umgebracht wurden enden in Downvotes. Da liegt der Unterschied zwischen ""Kritik an Verbrechen des Staates Israel"" und ""Israelkritik"", nur um deine Frage zu beantworten.

Um zum Ausgangsthema zurückzukommen: Ich verstehe die Argumentation der Beschneidungsgegner, absolut. Ich verstehe das Recht auf körperliche Unversehrtheit. Ich verstehe aber auch das Recht auf Freiheit der Religionsausübung, und sie sieht in gewissen religiösen Kreisen eine Jungenbeschneidung vor. Da muss der Gesetzgeber nun abwiegen, welches Recht in welchem Fall höher steht. Das sehen die einen so, und die anderen so. Und ich finde, in diesem Fall hat der Gesetzgeber einen akzeptablen Kompromiss gefunden mit dem diese Religionsausübung möglich ist, aber medizinische Komplikationen zumindest enorm eingedämmt werden.

Im Moment ist das ja auch eine Debatte ohne die Betroffenen. Wenn sich ein jüdischer oder muslimischer Mann hinstellt und zu seinen Eltern sagt ""Ihr hattet nicht das Recht mich beschneiden zu lassen"", dann muss das Verfahren noch einmal aufgerollt werden.

In other words, since the CDU (Merkel's party) gets consistently more votes than the next biggest party (SPD, the social democrats), it is very likely that the next German chancelor will be Merkel again, even if the exact *coalition* that will carry her is still very much in the air.

How does ""common goals"" mean ""do not like"" in your vocab? 

""Harm anyone"" - but this whole idea of ""harming anyone"" means precisely that subjectivist way of thinking I was criticizing: that people should live for subjective goals as long as they do not prevent others from doing so. 

But what I was saying was precisely _not_ living for merely subjective goals but society providing higher goals to live for.

It sounds as if you didn't even put in the effort to read and interpret an opinion, just repeating a ""canned"" answer.

Also what does even ""do not have rights"" mean? No rights at all? No right to life or free speech? Who even talked about that? Who are you even talking to, some imagined person or me?

If you want the ""rights"" narrative - even though I find the whole narrative of rights too subjective - then even in that narrative one can say equal rights means equal rights to the same thing, and not to different things. Given that marriage is a private act, and merely recognized or not recognized by the state, and the state never allows or bans it but merely recognizes it or not, then sameness or difference of course should be interpreted from the perspective of the society and not the individual. 

But I would prefer not even using the rights narrative because that is too subjective. After all the public recognition of a private act is never a right - it is a privilege. Even without that public recognition marriage stays as a private act, perfectly tolerated, hence the lack of public recognition does not violate any rights.

Really to understand this you need to adopt a grander perspective. The whole modern attitude to relationships is wrong, even for straight people. People should not just stumble into one selfish romance from another one, the old times when your parents who were wise and had life experience choose you a partner who will be a faithful ally for life and a good parent and a good member of a family as an economic unit was IMHO better for the sustained health and demographics of nations, even if it suppressed subjective choice.",0,1363778497,null,0,false,0,c8z1nok,t3_1alekp,t1_c8z1nok,t1_c8z1ipn,null,1431644543,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

To put it in plain terms. The troika gives you a plan (mostly devised by Germany from our perspective) and you follow it. You do not have an alternative, you follow it.  
  
When our troika plan started, the Portuguese massively voted for it. They believed that if we sacrificed ourselves, if we followed the plan, we would be better. Turns out that didn't happen...
  
Turns out the troika doesn't know what the fuck they are doing. So now the blame for the plans not working and things getting progressively worse is put on the troika.

Je vais répondre sur ma perception du sub-reddit et du ""game"" puisqu'ils sont effectivement très liés. 

Je ne me suis pas plongé assez dans la communauté, ni dans la lecture de toute la biblio qui inonde ce petit monde pour que ce commentaire ait plus de valeur que ça.

Je suis globalement d'accord avec toi sur les aspects négatifs du game et de la figure du pick-up artist. La théorisation du jeu de la séduction (Plus que de la compétition, à mon sens...) peut en effet être un terreau fécond pour le développement d'une vision sexiste des relations. 

Pourtant, l'une des bases de cette théorie est que ce que la femme attend de toi, c'est ce que tu attends d'elle. Si tu dois faire ton maximum, pour être fun, pour avoir en réserve quelques sujets de conversation bateaux, pour avoir un ou plusieurs accessoires qui attire l'oeil et les commentaires (peacocking, dans le jargon), c'est pour que vous deux, parfaits inconnus, passiez un bon moment à discuter de façon triviale (small talk...)

Il y a vraiment l'idée que ce qui te plait à toi, à toutes les chances de plaire aux femmes de ton entourage.

En cela, la théorie n'est pas sexiste.

**La séduction, c’est une affaire de mecs :**

L'idée que seuls les mecs galèrent à trouver des partenaires, c'est de la connerie. Ça m'énerve presque autant que cette histoire selon laquelle [les femmes ont en moyenne 4 partenaires sexuels dans leur vie alors que les hommes en ont 11.6](http://www.lesbridgets.com/index.php/Etude-/-Statistiques-sur-le-couple/Etude-sur-la-sexualite-des-francais-les-femmes-s-emancipent.html). Non, seulement ça participe à la vision sexiste de la sexualité (Est-ce que je suis une salope parce que je me suis tapé 8 mecs depuis le lycée? Est ce que je suis un toccard, parce que je n'ai connu bibliquement que 3 femmes dans ma vie?), mais surtout ce n'est pas possible...

Sauf à considérer que l'homosexualité masculine est suffisamment importante pour compenser la différence, (Cet article à la con donne 4% d'homosexuels pour les deux sexes... En faisant un modèle ultra foireux, où les gens sont soit hétéro soit homo, il faudrait donc que les homosexuels hommes aient en moyenne près de 200 partenaires sexuels dans leur vie.) le nombre de partenaires sexuels est nécessairement le même dans les deux sexes. 

Tout comme le nombre de célibataires... Si tu galères à trouver quelqu'un, une personne du sexe opposé est dans la même situation que toi. C'est mécanique.

Et, je comprends que tu ne l'acceptes pas.

*Note:* Je ne suis pas sûr d'avoir été très clair dans mes explications, je veux bien développer, si tu n'as pas compris ce que je voulais dire ici...

**Ce que ça dit sur la vision de l’homme:**

Encore une fois, je suis d'accord pour dire que l'homme n'a pas de raison d'être musclé, mais le sport participe à un style de vie sain, et en cela t'aide à être mieux dans tes baskets. Je ne suis pas un grand sportif, mais passer un trimestre sans chausser mes crampons de rugby me met le moral à plat.

De plus, réussir à courir un kilomètre supplémentaire sans cracher tes poumons, faire dix pompes de plus que la semaine précédente, nager 5 longueurs de plus en 40 minutes que 3 mois avant, toutes ces petites choses te boostent ton estime de toi...

**Ce que ça dit sur la vision de la femme**

Je suis d'accord, que la plupart du vocabulaire utilisé dans les Field Report est pourri et va complètement dans ton sens.

Cyprus, as a state, can get by until June. The problem is with Laiki and the Bank of Cyprus. It is said that Asmussen, during the Eurogroup's proceedings, threatened to cut them off. But this is practically impossible for now. What worries me the most is how the locals will react when the bank holiday ends. I like to think that the Cypriot Parliament voting ""no"" gave them a sign of hope, and they won't rush and get all their money (or, at least, most of them won't).

They do have some alternatives. If worse comes to worst, they could access pension funds. They could also issue ""gas bonds"", for long-term investors. Returns seem promising, most locals won't get anywhere in 10 years, they might as well help their economy.

You are correct in designating the German elections as a landmark. But the Opposition is even more ""anti-Russian"" (again, for lack of a more appropriate term). It would be difficult for them to agree, even as part of another Grand Coalition.

As for Eurogroup's reaction if Cyprus finds a solution that doesn't hurt Russians much, I think that we'll witness another episode of obfuscatory fudging (I should trademark that). Saying ""no, we won't even give you the €10bn"" will send Cyprus straight to Russia (Russia could stop bothering with Syria altogether). Also, German industries might pay quite a bit more for Russian gas.

You mixed up relative (most votes but not necessarily 50%) and absolute (more than 50%) majority with simple (more than 50%) and two third (more than 66%) majority. The chancellor needs a simple majority in the Bundestag to get elected.

election process:
the president of germany (Joachim Gauck) assignes the biggest party of the Bundestag the task to find a majority for a chancellor. 

If one party holds more than 50% of the seats this is easy, but happend only once in the beggining of the FRG and is unlikely to happen ever again. If this is not the case the biggest party has to find a coalition partner to reach a majority. Usually the parties issue a coalition intention before the elections take place (at the moment SPD and Greens, CDU/CSU and FDP). Coalition means two or more parties negotiate a coalition treaty where they make compromises to get a common ground for the next 4 years.

If the biggest party can't find a majority, the second biggest party will be ordered to find a majority. If nobody can form a coalition with more than 50% of the seats, there will be a new election (never happened).

A special case could be if SPD and Greens form a coalition but have less than 50% and the Linke helps them get their candidate elected, but refuses to be part of the coalition for the next 4 years. Every vote in the Bundestag has to be negotiated between SPD/Greens and the Linke to ensure a majority for the decision. This is considered unstable, not desired and unlikely.

The next election:
The outcome of the next election will probably look like this: CDU/CSU (centre-right) = biggest party, SPD (centre-left) = second biggest party, Greens (centre-left) = third, Linke (left) = fourth, FDP (liberal) = fifth. (Beware: liberal in Europe doesn't mean the same as liberal in the USA)

CDU/CSU/FDP will probably not have enough seats to continue their government due to a weak FDP. SPD/Greens will not have enough seats for a majority either and nobody wants to form a coalition with the Linke. The most likely outcome will be a big coalition between CDU/CSU/SPD with Merkel as chancellor.

How will this big coalition affect german EU politics: SPD will probably soften some of the austerity measurements demanded by CDU/CSU but not that much. The biggest change will be speed. Merkel is known to keep her options open to the last possible moment. SPD is more likely to rally behind an idea and implement it as soon as possible.

Edit: CDU/CSU, SPD, Greens, Linke and FDP are all pro EU. SPD and Greens are probably more in favour of a more powerful EU Parliament, more common EU regulations in general and especially for the financial sektor issued by new EU Organs like an EU finance ministery etc. CDU/CSU wants mostly to keep the souvereignity of the states and strenghten the common EU Market with less regulations. All 3 support the austerity measurements in Europe to an extend. SPD/Greens focus more on saving welfare spending and want the banks, richs and big companies to pay for the crisis, while the CDU/CSU cuts across the board and is more likely to put money into the economy. But that's just the focus. None of these 3 parties wants to save welfare at all costs or save the banks at all costs.
The Linke wants heavy regulation of banks, ultra high taxes on the rich, and welfare for all. The FDP is the opposite of the Linke but currently kept on their feet by their coalition partner.

Even if this is a worthwhile goal (though I'm not quite sure what a ""traditional family"" is - families have changed a lot over the last few centuries), how does legalising same-sex marriage get in the way of it?  I don't think many LGBT people have opposite-sex relationships purely because that is the only way they can get married.  People in same-sex relationships can still have kids, whether naturally or through surrogacy, adoption or fostering.

Also, it's not exactly obvious that having more children makes the nation ""strong"" - otherwise why are so many governments trying to limit population growth?

&gt; Well I don't want to break tradition and don't want more equality. Why does everybody seems to want it?

I can imagine it being hard to understand if you have never experienced this kind of inequality.  Almost everywhere in the world, LGBT people experience a huge amount of prejudice, and it does have very damaging consequences (such as mental health problems, suicide, hate crimes, and STIs) on an individual or societal level.  One of the main reasons people give for supporting same-sex marriage is that it would promote the idea that LGBT people are just as good as straight cis people, and help to stop some of this prejudice.

And here's the question I ask everyone on this topic: if you think that a marriage should only be legally recognised if it is between a man and a woman, how should we legally classify someone as a ""man"" or a ""woman""?  Gender is very complicated, and there are many trans and intersex people who fall in between the two extremes.  I suspect you probably disagree with the way it works in most of Europe (you are assigned a gender by medics at birth, but can change it later in life if you want).",0,1363782163,null,0,false,0,c8z26bj,t3_1alekp,t1_c8z26bj,t1_c8z1gnf,null,1431644796,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Je n'ai pas parlé de dictature ni de rôle du président de la république. On a reproché à Hollande son manque d'autorité et d'influence, c'est tout ce que je disais. 

Après de là à dire qu'il dirige l'État pour le peuple ... je suis loin d'être convaincu, il est dans la continuité avec le gouvernement précédent. Il ne me semble pas qu'il ait suivi le peuple sur les questions européennes par exemple. On reste dans du clientélisme avec des lois symboliques pour quelques minorités et lobbys. Bref, rien de neuf.

&gt;La grosse différence entre Hollande et Sarko, c'est que Sarko ""profitait"" de la crise pour faire passer tout un tas de mesures (hausse des impôts, des cotisations, du temps de travail, etc...) en mettant ça sur le dos de la crise, et en nous disant que c'était nécessaire, alors que in fine, ça servait souvent à aider ses potes.

Hollande fait exactement la même chose. Gouverner par les émotions, ce n'est pas gouverner pour le peuple.

Edit :

&gt;Tu penses que c'est la solution ? Donc en gros, pour contrer ceux qui ne respectent pas les lois en place, on va en refaire de nouvelles, encore plus restrictives... Ca va juste faire chier ceux qui respectent déjà les lois, donc aucun intérêt.

Je n'ai pas donné d'avis, je réponds à la question ""quelles seraient leur*s* solution*s* miracle, alors ?"". 

Par ailleurs, tu n'as évidemment pas été sur le lien. Il n'y a aucune proposition de nouvelle loi. Par contre il est proposé d'appliquer les lois existantes sans aucune tolérance.

Si tu veux mon avis, je pense que la réduction de l'immigration et des naturalisations serait une très bonne chose. Pour les autres mesures, je suis partagé : j'ai déjà été agressé plusieurs fois par des jeunes cons très connus des services de police, mais qui n'ont jamais vu un juge ou même un assistant social. Ma plainte pour vol avec violences n'a jamais abouti, celle pour violences en réunion non plus. Pourtant l'un de ceux qui m'a agressé avait déjà été soupçonné de ... 13 cas de violences. Tu ne trouves pas qu'il y a un problème ? Comment tu veux améliorer la situation, en leur filant plus d'allocs ?

La solution serait déjà d'appliquer les lois existantes. Les contrôles policiers n'ont pas d'impact sur la délinquance, mais ils ont un impact sur le sentiment d'insécurité des riverains (quand l'individu lambda voit une patrouille et des contrôles, ça le rassure). La peine de mort reste une connerie, je serai plus en faveur de laisser les condamnés à perpétuité le choix entre suicide/euthanasie et prison à vie.

L'économie se casse la gueule, les investisseurs fuient, les taux d’intérêt s'envolent, et compagnie... idem en cas de sortie de l'euro, ça serait une véritable folie... ce que le FN ne dis pas, puisque mis à part essayer de surfer sur la vague des mécontents de l'euro (donc ceux qui ne comprennent rien à l'économie), il n'y a aucune réalité économique derrière ce choix.

Non, veux-tu que je te rappelle les très nombreux cas de banqueroute des États ? On s'en est remis à chaque fois. Par ailleurs, le programme économique du FN prévoit une forte récession. C'est d'ailleurs le seul à être honnête là-dessus. Mais je suppose que tu ne l'as pas lu. Tiens, voilà des liens sérieux de mecs pas du tout d'extrême droite.

Le ""Game"" :
- Ne s'adresse qu'aux hommes.
- Théorise un modèle masculin universel de prédateur.
- Place la femme dans une situation de proie, d'objet ou d'ennemi.

Et au final on se retrouve avec des gens qui ne se demandent plus vraiment ce que l'autre veut, appliquent sans trop réfléchir des techniques (le kino, le BL, tous ces trucs aux noms pompeux), se placent dans une optique de compétition (où il faut ""gagner"", cad réussir à pécho) et oublient finalement qu'ils ont en face un être humain.

Au final, non seulement la théorie déshumanise la relation H/F pour la réduire à un ensemble de techniques, mais en plus il porte avec lui de forts relents sexistes, parfois franchement immondes (cf la culture du viol). Et si certains sont capables de faire le tri, je suis aussi certain que cela participe à un climat favorable au sexisme et à la misogynie.

- The native Cypriot feelings on the matter. Since we already have two sovereign territories on the island (Akrotiri and Dhekelia) there have been protests about our activity there and more calls of 'colonialism' from the previous President. I'm not sure losing their independence would go down well at a time of heated politics anyway (although I'd be interested hearing from Cypriots on this matter). 

- The Turkey/Greece/EU/Russia quadrilangle. Do we really want to get embroiled in this? The island is already divided politically between Turks and Greeks (been there done that with Ireland). Then the EU and Russia have vested interests (both financially and politically). Perhaps we could get the EU to agree to such a measure, but if we instate the £GBP on Cyprus as a buffer currency under the control of the Bank of England then it would surely act as an affront to the Eurozone on our behalf (and despite popular sentiment, I don't think we should be pissing off the rest of our continent).

Well..

&gt;In May 1998, **11 Member States met the convergence criteria** and thus formed the first wave of entrants which would go on to adopt the euro as their single currency. **These were Belgium**, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, and Finland. Denmark and the United Kingdom had ‘opted out’ from participating in the third stage of EMU, **while Greece and Sweden did not fulfil all the criteria.**

Although it is my understanding that there was some broad allowance to make this to happen, and by that I mean reeaallly broad.  For example having public debt/ GDP ratio decreasing was enough to qualify instead of just having to reach the target.  We were really steadily decreasing this so..  Also that last part was really saying something (the one about Sweden being rejected) because also Netherlands and Austria did not quite fulfill their criterion either [Good read here about the convergence criteria as a political tool.](http://www.voxeu.org/article/politics-maastricht-convergence-criteria)

&gt;If one country leaves the Euro, the prospect of further countries leaving the Euro becomes a possibility.

Any country can leave Euro and EU any time they want, but so far countries are lining up to join Euro.

&gt;for the same reason that Cyprus would want to leave, and start 
printing its own currency: in order to finance its government and shore up its economy.

The reason Cyprus is in a bad spot, is because they mismanaged their economy. They offered 4% interest on deposits, which translates to a pyramidal scheme. When the inflation is only 1-2%, and the ECB interest rate is 0.75%, the only way you can guarantee a 4% interest on deposits is either by running a pyramidal scheme or by doing very risky investments, such as buying Greek bonds. They probably did both.


&gt;Cyprus is able to kick a pebble down the hill, and start a landslide.


It will not start a landslide, because the advantages to belong to the Euro zone when you have a well managed economy far outweigh the loss of control over the interest rates. 

Controlling your own currency is the wet dream of governments with rampant corruption and tax evasion.

&gt;Cyprus appears to be the first country which is actually calling their bluff.

This is like saying the homeless down the street called Bill Gates' bluff. 

&gt;Cyprus has initiated a count-down to leaving the currency, and now is in a strong position to dictate its own terms.

It ill be much better for the Euro zone if they leave but it will be a disaster for Cypriots.

&gt;And if they do manage to get a favourable deal, it will change the negotiating positions of all other periphery countries.

It will not change anything. No other EU country runs a pyramidal scheme 4 times the size of their economy. The only other notable example is Iceland.

&gt; The core must decide, whether to stump up the cash, and to some extent accept the ongoing principle of fiscal transfers, or whether to let the Euro collapse inwards. 

Euro will not collapse. Greece and Cyprus should have never been allowed to join Euro in the first place.

&gt; Ultimately, how much is the single currency worth to Germany, and its fellow travellers?

Euro provides enormous advantages to its members but it has the side effect of exposing the mismanaged and corrupt countries.

&gt;Although it is my understanding that there was some serious rule-bending to allow this to happen.

Yes, they ignored the Maastrich criteria. [Link to them here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria)

Why are you so against the fact that the reason that Belgium is in the Euro, is that the size of your national debt was ignored (just like Italy's and Greece's btw). The only three countries in the EU that consistently have followed them, are Estonia, Finland and Sweden (bizarely enough, since we are not even in the Euro). 


&gt;while Greece and Sweden did not fulfil all the criteria.

Sweden has willingly never fulfilled the criteria, since we did not want to join the Euro without a  popular vote, which we had in 2003. The Swedes said no. Btw, the criteria we have never fulfilled is that we have never accepted ERM II, which is our official ""out"". We have *always* fulfilled the Euro convergence criteria. 


&gt;Why?

Because, the Euro is so damn incorrectly constructed, that it is laughable. The reason the situation is like it is, is among other things that according to Economics 101, the less competitive countries like Portugal et al, would loose in internal competitiveness (I think up until 2008 they lost 30%). Everyone knew that was going to happen, and the only way to handle it is austerity, which needs to be offset by massive transfers. The Eurozone are not doing the massive transfers, and even if they were, it would take decades to get to a competitive level. 

The bank saves are idiotic, the leadership is shitty etc. 

To top that off, it is more corrupt than Sweden. 

And, I think our politicians seems to be better equipped to handle economics, in particular our economics, than the EU ones. 

I am happy that we do not have to send (more billions) south or take part in a bank union. 

I am happy that we have an independent currency that caters to the interest of the Swedes, not the Italians, French, whatever

And, above all - I do not want a United states of Europe, which is what you need to save the Euro, a deeply integrated transfer union (where you'll send X% of your GDP south every year). I am Swedish and do not mind being part of trade union. I do not want to belong to a Eurounion, where every deciscion that concerns me get made from Brussels.

Not legalising, merely recognizing. Why does everybody seem to confuse these two? Privately anyone can marry their microwave oven. Whether it is recognized or not is different.

&gt;Also, it's not exactly obvious that having more children makes the nation ""strong"" - otherwise why are so many governments trying to limit population growth?

There is overpopulation. There is underpopulation - think pensions. 

&gt;One of the main reasons people give for supporting same-sex marriage is that it would promote the idea that LGBT people are just as good as straight cis people, and help to stop some of this prejudice.

What does ""just as good"" even mean? This a meaningless term: people are good or bad _for_ something. LGBT people can be just as good for a lot of things. Not for reproducting society, for that one not. 

&gt;and there are many trans and intersex people 

But this is not normal. This is just an idea the recent few decades of sexual liberalism made fashionable to try. I don't give a dam what happens with this kind of ultraliberal people. For all I care stay in their clubs, change gender any week, fuck a dog. All I want is to reserve special social respect for traditional, conservative child-making families who are like our grandparents, who never think of a sex change and do not think in malleable and complicated gender.

I mean gender is only complicated in an subjectivist culture where it is all about ""who you want to be?"" But when it is all about ""look, you must be this, this, this, do your duty, and enjoy the pride it brings"" then it is not complicated. 

All I want is that these conservative families should be seen as the backbone of society.

I have no problem with all the ultraliberals, complicated-genders and gays as long as they do not demand to be accepted in the mainstream of society and just do their thing in the queer clubs on the margins.

Because no society in history stayed strong and vigorous after submitting to subjectivism. Nobody ever created an empire on top of a subjectivist society nor saved one.

Because large depositors would be even more pissed off and would get out of Cyprus in droves. This would increase the amount of money needed for the recapitalization of Cypriot banks. It's totally self-defeating.

The negotiations probably went down like that.

CYPRUS: ""Your plan to forgive Greek debt caused problems in our banks. Since you forced us to follow it, we need some help now.""

EUROGROUP: ""We'll give you some. But there are a few among us claiming that you hold dirty money. If we do our part, you have to punish Russians.""

EUROGROUP: ""Then we won't give you any money.""

CYPRUS: ""OK, let's make do with what you can give us now.""

Cyprus returns home, knowing that there would be a political and media backlash, expecting a better deal while investigating alternatives. Eurozone enjoyed a few relatively calm months, but is a serial drama queen and we're back to square one.

According to [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16877870), about one in 5000 births displays ambiguous genitalia.

Which *part* of the reproductive system of a woman?  For example, I am pretty sure there are people born with both a penis and ovaries.  There are certainly trans men with a constructed penis and ovaries.  Also, people who don't reproduce might never know what gonads they have.

I only decided to reply to you originally because you mentioned Belgium in such a way as to misrepresent history.

Now:  

I'm well aware that the Maastricht criterion were fudged to launch the Eurozone and that they're now heavily enforced to keep crappy economies out of the Eurozone for as long as possible.  Only half of the countries fulfilled all the criterion properly before launch. I even linked you a whole paper about the subject, guess you didn't bother to read it.. :(

&gt;Sweden has willingly never fulfilled the criteria, since we did not want to join the Euro without a popular vote, which we had in 2003. The Swedes said no. Btw, the criteria we have never fulfilled is that we have never accepted ERM II, which is our official ""out"". 

Then, to be honest, not only do you not belong in the Eurozone but not in the EU either given that you are obliged to join and simply said ""no"" without being granted an opt-out.  

&gt;And, I think our politicians seems to be better equipped to handle economics, in particular our economics, than the EU ones.

[**“Sono un uomo di merda”**](http://sodeadestra.comunita.unita.it/2012/02/22/sono-un-uomo-di-merda/)

22 febbraio 2012

“Io song n’omme ‘e mmerda”. 

Non sono i versi di una canzone scurrile. Sono le incredibili parole, un autocondanna, un’autocritica alla Pol Pot, che gli operai ddella Fiat di Pomigliano sono costretti a pronunciare davanti a un microfono e davanti a compagni e capi in una specie di assemblea detta modernamente “acquario”. Un’umiliante penitenza richiesta quando quell’operaio “non regge le cadenze o sbaglia a montare un pezzo”. Forse questi sono i “fannulloni” a cui allude la Marcegaglia. Insomma l’operaio cede alla fatica e così “viene convocato a fine turno: capi e sottocapi lo circondano e gli fanno recitare al microfono” tali tremendi versetti. L’episodio è riportato non in un foglietto estremista diffuso dai duri della Fiom bensì dal “Foglio” di Giuliano Ferrara. E l’autore dell’articolo è un Gianfranco Pace che forse soffre le reminiscenze di un suo lontano passato. E il fatto era già stato raccontato da Loris Campetti sul “Manifesto”.

“Io sono un uomo di merda” è costretto a dire quell’operaio che come un novello Charlot non ce la fa a inseguire i ritmi di Marchionne. In una fabbrica dove se hai la tessera Fiom non entri. Come quando non si poteva avere l’Unità in tasca. E poi c’è chi osa tacciare di nostalgici del primo Novecento perfino coloro che nel Pd osano non osannare la politica Fiat. Ma chi sta facendo salti enormi all’indetro, in nome dei “tempi moderni” (titolo, appunto, del film di Chaplin)?

Un episodio che incita alla rivolta. Che prima o poi arriverà . E così i moderni proletari, per rimanere in tema, saranno costretti a riscoprire un antico sorpassato slogan soreliano: “A salario di merda lavoro di merda”.

&gt;Then, to be honest, not only do you not belong in the Eurozone but not in the EU either given that you are obliged to join and simply said ""no"" without being granted an opt-out. 

No, when we joined in 1995, it wasn't obligatory to join the Euro then. Other examples, Denmark and UK. We are following the rules.  You never seem to get your facts right, do you.

What, are you objecting to the fact that Sweden is one of the least corrupt countries in the world? And you can by no means understand apprehension or anger that our money is being taken care of by people on who are very much *not* from non corrupt countries? Is that completely not understandable to you? 

And, you can not see that someone with a working economy is looking at the behoviour in other states and be scared at what they are doing? 

Where have I said we are superior? Links please? I said, which I can happily follow up with facts of course, that we are less corrupt? I also said that Swedish politicians are more likely to prioritize  our interest than a French/Italian whatever. How is that wrong, or superior?  

Typically, you didn't answer to the facts of course, as in the how badly the Euro is constructed the Euro is, the lact in internal competitiveness, the bad banks saves or anything else. Do you think the Euro is constructed correctly, there has been no fall in internal competitiveness and the banks saves are exemplary? Why would anyone want to be in that mess.

1) Don't know that a debt/gdp ratio was considered within acceptance criteria even if it was above the target *as long as it was decreasing* so Belgium was allowed to use the Euro together with Netherlands, Ireland, Austria, Spain, Greece etc.

2) Don't know that Sweden is legally obligated to join the Euro by its own accession treaty!  Even a simple Google search shows this, I guess you aren't capable of doing so. [You are mistaken entirely in that regard.](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/countries/sweden_en.htm)

First, I didn't make that claim, merely that your entire argument was based around the notion that as a flawlessly non-corrupt nation, Sweden shouldn't have to actually help southern nations, not worthy because of their apparent corruption.  Do you have any idea how much of an ass that makes you sound like?  Either way, you still pretty much made that claim when:

&gt;**To top that off, it is more corrupt than Sweden.**

&gt;What, are you objecting to the fact that **Sweden is one of the least corrupt countries in the world?** And you can by no means understand apprehension or anger that our money is being taken care of by people on who are very much not from non corrupt countries?

&gt;**And, I think our politicians seems to be better equipped to handle economics, in particular our economics, than the EU ones.**

Oh my...

&gt; In no way have you showed me respect or tried to understand anyone else's *[suppose this means ""your""]* view

Yeah, arrogant nationalists do not deserve my respect.  People with only their national interests in mind doom the future of Europe, and that makes them dickweeds.  My only regret from this conversation is how few people will see it and know you for who you are.  You repeatedly made the same false assertions without being able to back them up, made false insinuations, and outed yourself as a selfish clod.

Feelings are unimportant. They are subjective. Everybody is responsible for their own feelings, we do not make others feel anything, we make ourselves feel things. If anyone feels worthless and subhuman by not getting a special privilege, the problem is with their own ego. Yes, of course there is a problem of a  few people being overly aggressive with gay people but that is not really related. That has more to do with the decline of gentlemanly politeness.

You are right with the intersex thing. That is different, because that is related to biological sex and not cultural gender. It is cultural gender that I say it is only complex if you allow it. Biological sex may be - genes can do weird stuff.

It's stuff like this that really makes me wish we either had a *real* union (i.e. one where individual countries can't pull shit like this^[1] ), or give up on the whole thing altogether.

^[1] In case you wonder why I think it is a shit thing to do: I'm all for a business-friendly environment, but a corporate tax rate of 28% (where it was originally, according to the article) is already reasonably low. Under the assumption that a company benefits from a functioning society (e.g. by making use of a well educated and healthy workforce), most people seem to think it is reasonable that companies should pay their share. 

Cutting corporate tax rates over and over again really has only one reason, and everyone knows it: the goal is to attract international companies to register (parts of) their operations in the low-tax country, which is then able to reap in the (reduced) tax income, at basically no cost.

The problem is obviously that while this might be *individually* rational, it is most certainly *not* in the best interest of nations *collectively*, since it is only a matter of time before another country lowers their rate even further, and more generally: since it reduces the overall tax income from corporations, without any rationale behind it other than increasing corporate profits.

Su rainews (non ricordo chi) qualcuno faceva notare i due diversi approcci: VW compra marchi di valore senza fondersi con essi, mentre FIAT è in procinto di fondersi interamente con un marchio praticamente decotto.

Un'altra cosa: Marchione aveva ricattato gli operai di Mirafiori con un referendum per fare loro accettare le nuove condizioni di lavoro (peggiorative), minacciando che con un NO non avrebbe investito i famosi 20 miliardi del piano ""Fabbrica Italia"". Vinto il referendum con solo il 54% (i colletti bianchi, meno colpiti dai nuovi contratti, sono stati determinanti all'esito positivo) ha poi sostanzialmente detto ""LOL just kidding, i 20 miliardi non li abbiamo nè li mettiamo fino a quando il mercato non si stabilizza"" (si prevede accadrà nel 2015-2016)

Mentre nello stabilimento Maserati, in cui la FIOM ha la maggioranza sindacale, i rapporti di lavoro sono ottimi. Sarà che hanno capito che i dieci minuti di pausa che Marchionne ha tagliato altrove (in cambio di qualche spiccio) o in generale il pugno duro non sono favorevoli a un lavoro proficuo.

Certo è facile per Volkswagen offrire un bonus di oltre 7000 euro ai propri operai essendo un colosso dell'industria con utili da record, ma comunque hanno capito che con la compartecipazione alle decisioni (Mitbestimmung) di sindacato con dirigenza c'è solo da guadagnarci.

2.

And, btw, how are things in Hungary?

3. Gay discrimination will not help to prevent population decline of EE one bit, on contrary: due to emigration of gay people, the situation will be even worse. That is one of the reason, for example, that every hi-tech company in Silicon Valley supports marriage equality: they know, that they have to attract the best people, including gay ones. And Eastern Europe? 

4. Not a single child more will be born if gays are denied marriage and respect. None. Because straight people do not think like ""Oh, my, if our gay neighbours can get married, then we will not have children."" No one thinks like that. Even more: discrimination is an important obstacle for gay people getting children.

Because, despite what the politicians might say, this lowering of the British corporate tax rate is most certainly *not* in order to help out small-to-medium businesses (reducing ancillary labour costs would probably really help them), but to attract tax income from large corporations.

&gt;A 20% corporate tax rate across the EU would kill some nations and be amazing for some others. Its all to do with individual state models.

Guess what? I really wouldn't mind seeing those ""individual state models"" that are basically built on being a tax haven for multinationals crawl into a corner and die. Let's introduce a 20% (or 25%, or whatever is a reasonable rate) corporate tax rate EU wide. No exceptions. And the next step is to make sure companies that make their money on the EU market pay some taxes in the EU.

2) Things are bad, but not due to this. Mainly economics.  The only reason of the demographic winter is the unstability of economic outlook. Culturally, almost every woman I know wants lots of kids, they are just afraid of the financial future.

3) Lack of special privilege is not discrimination. And while the emigration of liberal types of people (which is not that many) may make demographics worse in the short run, I am sure it makes it better in the long run because they are not around to prevent the development of a family-oriented culture.

4) Of course not such a ridiculous way. But this is being boggled down in small details. In the long run, if the social direction is towards equal respect of all relationships, it will encourage the /r/childfree kinds of attitudes: why waste my money, time, my figure, when the kids aren't even happy and society isn't respecting it? It is an ingredient in the long trend, not a binary thing. 

This is what I consider dishonest about todays liberals. When it is about something they support, they understand if a thing does not have a direct effect but still steer things in a certain way. But when it is about something they dislike then suddenly it is nitpicking about the details.

So I say fuck details. Look at trends. Modernity screws up demographics. Same-sex marriage is an extension of modernity. Modernity needs to slowed down and turned back. That is all I need. 

5) I am immune to being called fascist, because this term became meaningless:

""It will be seen that, as used, the word ‘Fascism’ is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley's broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else.""

This is lazy journalism and the author probably doesn't realize what living in a medieval state would be like. At any rate, The Byzantine Empire that existed after Manzikert was notorious for levying crushing taxes during crises and allowing large land owners to displace peasant farmers. Even during the decades proceeding Manzikert, senior civil and military officials were destroying the thematic system by claiming vast tracts of land in Anatolia and doing everything in their power to avoid taxation. This ultimately destroyed the empire's ability to quickly levy local militias and armies within border provinces.

While Alexios Komnenos did restore order and territorial integrity for Byzantium, it came at a great cost to commoners. Venice was given a favorable trade treaty that allowed the republic to dominate Byzantine state economics and trade, and the new field army was expensive to maintain and unable to deal with military matters on multiple fronts.

3) What? You really don't get it, do you? Marriage is a private act. What the whole thing  is about is merely its public recognition, which is an extra, a privilege. Hence not a right. It doesn't even have to do with rights, given that it is a privilege. It could just as easily happen that no marriage whatsoever is recognized publicly. Then everybody would have to write wills etc.  Equality doesn't even come into the question, because privileges don't need to be equal, only rights, but even if someone could cast this privilege as a right, equal rights are to the same things, not different things. If gay and straight can equally get a marriage with the other sex recognized, it is equal. Equal rights do not have to be customized to individual preferences.

true,ElizabethsaurusRex,UNSA,"California, USA","The Euro did not cause the property bubble, its collapse, or the global depression, but it did cause and is still causing a sovereign debt crisis and is prolonging the depression in Europe. To quote myself from a couple weeks ago:

&gt; Look, the current situation was pretty much inevitable when the EU set up the Euro. By giving up their own currencies they had central control over to the ECB the Eurozone countries lost a wide swathe of monetary policy tools available to them. As others have pointed out, the US can deficit spend at-will and do things like QE and capitalize financial institutions etc. because the Federal Reserve, which is governed by a dual mandate from Congress (low inflation / low unemployment) controls the US Dollar. When the US issues debt the Federal Reserve can always buy it. When creditors of the US Government want money there will always be dollars available to them. 
&gt;
&gt;In the Eurozone this isn't true. All the Eurozone countries gave up control of their monetary policy to the ECB. If Spain wants to issue debt it does so in Euros. Since Spain can't print Euros at-will, bondholders know they can only get paid back if the Spanish government has a budget that can meet all its spending obligations as well as debt service payments. So if Spain is running a deficit and its economy isn't doing so hot, investors panic because they know if Spain has to choose between default and mass rioting any Spanish government would choose default. This drives up the interest rate of Spanish bonds, making it harder for Spain to afford debt. Spain cuts its budget to reduce its deficit and please investors, but the cuts shrink the economy, cutting tax revenues and...increasing the deficit. 
&gt; 
&gt; It's a mad circle, which is why even though the collapse occurred in late 2008 here we are in 2013 and it's been crisis after crisis after crisis. The ECB refuses to guarantee debt issued by Eurozone governments and refuses to finance deficit spending. It will only accept austerity (the mad circle). The reasons for this have little to do with economics and all to do with politics - it would outrage the German government. So everyone else suffers. 
&gt;
&gt; The thing is, economists KNEW this would happen if the EU went ahead with the Euro. If there was ever a global recession the pieces holding the Euro up would fall apart and Eurozone governments would be left with little to no tools to fight it, at the mercy of the ECB. They went ahead and did it anyway because 1) the 1990s were an economic boom so everyone was only looking at the pluses 2) the conditions required for the death trap seemed highly improbable and 3) well but the ECB wouldn't do anything stupid...right?! The Eurozone had a huge flaw that any deep recession would have exposed.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;but it did cause and is still causing a sovereign debt crisis and is prolonging the depression in Europe

Could you expand a little more on this? I agree that the structure of the Eurozone has contributed to the problem, and I agree that the EU could've handled this better.

One issue is the comparison of QE between the USA and EU. You say the US can do QE, but then compare that with Spain doing QE. In the concept of the Eurozone, Spain is a State and the governing body is the EU/ECB (much like how Michigan is a state and the US government/Fed are the governing body). Thus the two are not directly comparable. That might seem strange given Spain is of course a country whereas Michigan is not, but both are members of a currency union, and in this very specific sense are equal (evidently to the detriment of Spain, Greece etc.). It would be like giving each individual state in the USA the power to do QE to solve state problems, which obviously doesn't work. You might criticise the Euro on this basis because Spain and Michigan should be seen as different (thus presenting a problem in the € model in the first place), and I completely agree with you.

Similarly, and I apologise if I have misunderstood, you seem to overlook the role of individual governments still. Continuing with the Irish example, I quote from the abstract of a paper delivered to the World Bank:

&gt;Among the triggers for the property bubble was the sharp fall in interest rates following euro membership: within the euro zone also the disciplines of the market which had traditionally served as warning signs of excess were muted. Lacking these prompts, Irish policymakers neglected the basics of public finance, wage policy and bank regulation. [Given May 2009.](http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/staff/phonohan/What%20went%20wrong.pdf)

In this case the eurozone created the conditions for the Irish debt crisis by offering Ireland better financial conditions than Ireland should have had. However the responsibility for why the debt crisis hit Ireland lays with the policymakers that allowed this to happen. Greece went on a big public spending spree after joining the Eurozone. Again, that rests with the government (though without the € this wouldn't be possible).",0,1363803386,null,0,false,0,c8z8jhz,t3_1anll3,t1_c8z8jhz,t1_c8z7kkq,null,1431647820,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

L'enseignement est une chose très compliquée, les générations ont énormément changé, je n'ai pas d'avis figé là-dessus, mais je trouve que le collège unique est problématique et que le primaire devrait se concentrer sur les bases.

Donc ils auraient dû faire comment gros malin ? Tu veux leur rajouter de la dette à payer pour rassurer les marchés ?

Nope, le blé est moins vital que le pétrole. On voit bien que tu ne connais rien à l'agriculture car sans pétrole, la production de céréales en France chuterait de 70%. Tu as une source qui prouve l'impact des marchés sur le blé ? Je connais des agriculteurs (céréales dans la Beauce), ils en savent plus que toi et se foutent des marchés.

true,DonkeyShotz,PORT,Portugal,"In Spain, Portugal and Greece corruption is rampant.

I've lived in Portugal my whole life (I’m Portuguese/Spanish), and even though the successive governments have somehow kept it under the radar, it’s ridiculous the amount of shit politicians get away with. I mean, many of them are into politics just to make money (let’s not be naive). They don’t even have a secondary education. I’m not saying that people without education can’t be good politicians, but when in the northern countries your leaders have gone to elite universities (I'm assuming), and when in the south (in this case Portugal) the ones who've actually gone to (shit) unis have fake Engineering degrees (the one and only ex-prime minister Jose Socrates, who was in power before and during the outburst of the crisis), you can kind of get an idea of why we are in the shit we're in.

If only we had more effective judicial systems much of what happened would have been avoided. 

Look at Spain for example: Rodrigo Rato managed to run a massive bank (Bankia) into the ground. He's occupied important positions both on governmental (minister of economy), international (head of IMF), and in the private sector. I’m not going to go into all the shit he's done but look him up and you'll see the kind of criminals that run these countries and how, even though they've been caught doing illegal things, they are still in positions of power. Hopefully if you read a bit instead of posting your ridiculously ignorant, naive and totally biased opinions, you'll see that it’s not the ""people"" of the countries that are to blame.  Maybe you'll stop saying that we are lazy, inefficient or whatever bullshit you regurgitate.

Of course, now you'll say that it’s the people's fault for voting for them and putting them in power...of course you're right, but when you have the choice between voting for a retard and voting for a retard, what choice do you really have?

But now let’s look at the Northern countries, which have little to blame for in terms of what lead to the crisis, but some culpability when it comes to the solutions for it:

Let’s use Portugal as an example. Portugal needs about 100 Billion Euros from the EU or it goes bankrupt and leaves the Euro. If Portugal leaves and defaults on its debts all the countries to whom it owes money to lose out (Germany, etc...). This, among many other issues, is why many of the retards on this thread saying we should leave the Euro zone have absolutely no credibility or knowledge on the issue at hand. 

Now it’s just a question of game theory. What is one country expecting the other to do? That’s where the bailed-out countries have lost out, and that’s why, to some extent, the people in these countries, as you correctly say, blame Germany (obviously the government not the Germans, whom we have nothing but love for). The troika set its conditions, and instead of threatening to leave (to get a better agreement) we obeyed. We lost the game, yes, and now we are paying. We lost because we have corrupt politicians who couldn’t care less and have imposed most if not all of the costs on the people. Look at former PM of Portugal Socrates:  he basically signed the conditions and then left his position. Now he's studying something at a university in Paris when he's not being paid thousands to give conferences. 
We blame Germany, but not on its own. In Portugal we blame the Troika, upon which Germany has an undeniable influence. The German government rightly and fairly imposed its conditions in exchange for reforms that according to the Troika would solve our issues. However, those reforms have not led to what was promised, and even though the IMF itself said they haven’t worked, we, the people, are suffocating with all the cuts. So, naturally, we ask ourselves why the fuck should we keep our promises when they haven't kept theirs? And that is the source of the small blame we put on the Germans.

For the pundits: don't say that Cyprus invested in risky assets when Germany and whatnot did the exact same thing (yes you also bought Greek and Portuguese bonds) and are fucked if the PIGS bail, so this bailout isn't just beneficial to us. There isn't really a difference between Germany and Cyprus when it comes to investing in risky assets. The problem is something else, which I'll leave you to find out by yourself.

I've surely made mistakes and been biased in what I've said, so I'll gladly stand corrected when the fury of the pseudo-economists on this thread goes on full retard mode.

*it seems unfair for the Greeks to pay any interest on loans in a desperate situation, but from our point of view the interest is fictional because the Greeks will never be able to repay those loans in full; it's only there as an excuse used to hide the flow of money to Greece from our population.*

true,elphieLil84,sardegna,,"Il problema é che tutto ció avrebbe senso in un sistema politico altamente razionalizzato e poco incline al populismo, in un paese senza una storia di scorciatoie economiche facili e distruttive nel lungo termine, e con un ottimo statista al timone.

Nel nostro sistema puntare tutto sulla crescita senza risolvere sprechi,mafie, corruzione, corportaivismi, liberalizzazione di alcuni settori e garanzia dei crediti, é un suicidio. Lo é perché pomperemmo risorse che finirebbero sempre negli stessi canali di scolo.

Una combinazione di misure austere e investimento nei settori di crescita (educazione, ricerca e innovazione), per me sarebbe il metodo migliore.

Una cosa non sana che é stata proposta, per esempio, é secondo me dare un forte sostegno (leggi:sussidio) alle piccole e medie imprese (SME) in maniera non mirata ma generica. Non é sano perché non guarda ai motivi base per i quali le SME falliscono in Italia. Falliscono perché tendono ad essere a gestione familiare (anche se mio figlio é piú scemo e meno competente di un mio manager, dó la gestione a lui dopo di me anziché lasciargli giusto i profitti) e perché non investono in innovazione ed espansione. Se dai i soldi a caso tieni su dei mostri che erano comunque destinati a morire,salassando le casse dello Stato. Non mi pare che ci siano state proposte di sostenere solo investimenti di innovazione ed espansione, o di sottometterli a valutazione della gestione.

Come dice ponchietto, l'idea tedesca dell'economia é certo morale, ma ""l'immoralitá"" congenita nella cultura ed economia italiana non fa che dar loro ragione. E cosí anche le malgestioni spagnole, le truffe greche e gli sprechi portoghesi. 

Gli unici che avevano diritto a ribellarsi a questa visione erano gli irlandesi, vittime semplicemente del colpo di frusta della housing bubble. E invece loro zitti zitti hanno messo giú la testa e messo in pratica le misure richieste dalla troika, rinegoziando peró con intelligenza e orgoglio, e adesso i loro bonds valgono piú di quelli di Italia, Spagna, Grecia, Spagna....

Non hanno mai fatto piagnistei pubblici su salassi da parte della UE, non hanno dato colpe alla UE, hanno riso e scherzato sulla Merkel ma si sono anche dati da fare. E non sono state misure semplici. I loro dipendenti pubblici avevano stipendi ed agevolazioni stellari, perché durante la Celtic Tiger ( http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigre_celtica ) era cosí poco redditizio essere pubblici impiegati che dovettero alzare stipendi e privilegi per avere abbastanza gente che ci lavorasse. Ovviamente, con la crisi loro sono stati le prime vittime del downsizing. I sindacati hanno dato battaglia,ma con un braccio di ferro che dura ancora oggi, le spese le hanno tagliate. E badate bene, il dialogo frale parti in Irlanda é religione di stato. E fra una cosa e l'altra, adesso sono gli unici che stanno risalendo. E senza tante storie, che la loro dignitá  é tale che pensare di chiagnere e incolpare gli altri non é concepibile.

true,Xuth,UKGB,United Kingdom,"This is a common misconception (one which I have, strangely enough, looked in depth at as part of my political communications module at university).

It appears to come from a story based on a misinterpretation of the [1960 Exchange of Notes on Financial Assistance to the Republic of Cyprus](http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2006.nsf/All/F207EF6146AA7AFEC22571BF0038DDC6/$file/Treaty%20of%20Establishment.pdf) - which is probably the constitutional paper to which you refer.

It has been variously spinned out of control to people who (probably quite rightly!) want to see those territories returned to Cypriot control. 

In that document it describes, that following the declaration of independence, the UK was giving financial aid ""by way of grant"" to Cyprus on a 'tapering' basis - which was to total £12 million, with £4 million in the first year, down to £1.5 million in the 5th year. 

Tapering meaning that the amount would gradually reduce in size (presumably as the Cypriots continued on the path to full independent control of their own future).

Additionally there are other very specific payments related to the arrangements for independence. Then there is a provision that the UK is, every 5 years, to review &amp; determine (in consultation with Cyprus) the amount of financial aid to be provided over the *next* 5 years ""taking all factors into account, including the financial requirements of the Government of the Republic"" - clearly linking it to the needs of the new government, not to anything that the UK is paying for. 

The common mistake is to claim that the money was rent for the bases, but the bases were not rented (they are Sovereign entities of the United Kingdom) and are at no point linked with any rent on behalf of the UK. 

Instead, it is financial aid which occurs on a reducible basis, with no guarantee of anything after the first 5 years - it is (was) entirely for the UK to decide how much and for how long. This means the supposed ""estimates"" of something actually owed are entirely fanciful. As far as my research took me, there has been no demand made by the Government of Cyprus  nor have there been any actions with any international court - making me quite certain that there is no outstanding debt in relation to Akrotiri and Dhekelia.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; Ultimately corporate taxation is taxing owners and customers. Mostly owners. So it could just as well be 0% and the owners income taxed. Why do we even have it? After all the educated workforce etc. benefits the owners, not the corporation. 

An overly-simplified example to show *why* corporation tax is needed. Let's say I earn £50k a year gross. I will be paying roughly 20% income tax on that. So I pay £10k in tax, and have £40k left to spend on food, bills, rent/mortgage payments, maybe with some left over for savings.

So... if there's no corporation tax, what do I do instead? I set up a company. I work for the company (for free, or for a nominal amount) and the company contracts me out to whoever I work for. So the company earns that £50k income. I am paying 0 tax. The company is paying 0 tax. Now the company can use that money to do all the things I would have done (buy food, pay bills, rent etc., save what's left) - I have avoided paying any income tax.

Obviously under current rules, there always comes a point where someone is better off switching to a company structure rather than paying income tax (it depends on the expenses of the company and so on, but if you're earning more than £90k, corporation tax is less than income tax).

We want people to pay tax; so either we change the rules on incorporation (so companies are tax-transparent, like partnerships), or we need corporation tax, otherwise there is a really easy way for people to avoid paying tax.",0,1363808954,null,0,false,0,c8zamrp,t3_1antsg,t1_c8zamrp,t1_c8z84se,null,1431648834,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,ElizabethsaurusRex,UNSA,"California, USA","I think we mostly agree.

I agree giving each state the power to do QE would be silly but it would have been great if the federal government had agreed to make up the difference when state budgets started showing massive deficits. States can issue bonds but they usually only do so for specific projects. They cannot continually run budget deficits for pretty much the same reasons, so for example my home state of California has slashed its budget from $146 billion before the recession to $92 billion. I think this is absolutely appalling and an abrogation of the government's duties to its people and I would hope European countries would not want to be in the same situation!

So yes Spain and Michigan should be different, we agree there. The people of Michigan have the federal US government to fall back on if the state collapses or goes bankrupt or whatever. The Spanish people don't have that option. 

Federalism is a very stupid idea and I despise it - the government must be given power to make its own monetary policy or else it will face this kind of crisis. The only way to do it and avoid a crisis would be for the top-level government to either guarantee debt of lower level governments or to finance their deficit spending directly. This is not optimal and very obviously not at all possible politically.

The only way to insulate the Euro from sovereign debt crises would be a real federation of the European Union, at the cost of sovereignty of national governments. Whether or not that's desirable I don't really have an opinion, that's up to the European people. But the only alternative is to dissolve the Euro.

Another alternative would I guess be to limp from crisis to crisis until the global economy picks up, which seems to be what the ECB is hoping for. Maybe Europe will make it to the next economic uptick but the factors that caused the sovereign debt crisis will still be there.

I agree with you on your last point about the Euro and easy credit for national governments. Why interest rates fell is beyond me since a sovereign debt crisis was a real possibility talked about at the time and the underlying ability of countries to pay back their debt ~~did not change~~ (EDIT: oops, yes it did - it worsened!), but hey we're talking about an economic crash that was partly brought on by banks doling out $500,000 loans to people with no proof of income so perhaps we really should pay attention to the fact the people will do stupid things when given the chance when we make financial law.",0,1363809546,null,0,1363810467,0,c8zauzp,t3_1anll3,t1_c8zauzp,t1_c8z8jhz,null,1431648946,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Now: value means suitability for a purpose and nothing else. This was nailed down right at the beginning of our civ: Plato. A good knife means not something generally good value, but a knife well suitable for cutting. 

There is no such thing as general value, only as a suitability for a purpose.

Now it is clear why I reject the label fascist: they came with this dumb ideas like ""untermensch"" meaning some people can generally low value. But there is no such thing as general value.

Similarly people cannot be equal in general value, because there is no such thing as general value. Only for a specific purpose.

This is why equality is meaningless. And also hierarchy is meaningless - only hierarchy for a purpose makes sense.

Bad economy also stimulizes it (the stereotyping, looking for someone to blame and stuff). That is why instead of ''kicking'' Greece out of the EU we should help them out. Even though Greece did not completely have all the economic requirements to enter the EU, the EU chose to let Greece in and it'd be pathetic to just kick them out now. We are responsible for this and we will finish what we started. Together, not as Germans, Greeks, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italians, but as European people! 

Sorry, it's getting late, my idealistic and optimistic side tends to get the better off me then, haha. One of the biggest problems with what I say here above is that it's hard to ''unite and help each other out as Europeans'' as it's the (well not all but still) corrupt politicians who've got all the power. That's why one of the most important changes the EU has to make is definitely more democracy. Only if the EU becomes more democratic can we progress, because nobody would want just a bunch of bureaucratic politicians to have all the power. 

I'm debating with myself here, even after counter-arguing what I too optimistically said at first you can still see that I appear really pro European in the second part too. And I am, I like the idea and I like what the EU is based on, I just don't like how the EU works right now.

Also, if you list some major western countries in order of corporation tax, what you'll find is a correlation between that tax and growth rates since the crash. What that shows is that a high-tax, progressive and pro-active tax policy is the way to go.

Where's the fucking logic in that? The Conservatives, citing the Laffer curve, said that the 50% tax would cause a reduction in tax revenue. Even when the evidence showed otherwise, they acted as though it had lost the government money and called it a failed policy.

The national European governments are issuing bonds, but they don't have control of the ECB or the Euro. The US Federal Government does exercise some power over the Federal Reserve and is the ultimate authority on the US Dollar.

Also I just did some googling and apparently the ECB is forbidden by treaty from financing government debt. I thought they were just jerks...anyway even the new Open Monetary Policy [imposes austerity]( http://blogs.wsj.com/eurocrisis/2013/03/13/how-the-ecb-learned-to-love-monetization/) as a condition and has a lot of other conditions as well. Basically If Eurozone governments don't find buyers for their debt the ECB isn't going to buy it and they can't borrow money. A government that can't borrow money is a dead one.

So basically you buy a US bond, you're going to get dollars when it matures guaranteed (unless Congress fucks with the debt ceiling again which is how our credit rating got hit for no good reason). If you buy a Spanish or Greek bond you're only going to get euros when it matures if the government can afford it, since they can't just arbitrarily increase their deficit. The euro has turned government into a zero-sum game between debt service and other functions.

If I were in the ECB's position I'd issue Cyprus a loan, clean up their banks' exposure to bad financial instruments and make the Cypriot government pass laws so it doesn't happen again - decrease leverage, require more diversified holdings, whatever. But that's a ""bailout"" that everyone hates.

Editing some more: Of course if I was in Cypriot government's position I'd give everyone else a big fuck you, exit the Eurozone and start issuing Cypriot pounds, give depositors accounts in a state-run bank with balances roughly equivalent to what they had in euros (with an exchange rate estimated with great care), develop the gas fields Norway-style, and run tourism ads.

I am in no way disputing that Greece have a corruption problem, a big one. And, whatever happens, that corruption will stop you from being comptetitive, and stop investors from coming to Greece. It should be priority 1 for the government, for sure. 

However, the same thing that is happening in Greece is happening in Portugal/Spain, and to a lesser extent, Italy. Portugal/Spain might not be angels, but they are far less corrupt than Greece. So, while corruption is most definately part of the picture - *in Greece* (and will stop you from bouncing back), it is not the reason while competitiveness was lost in southern Europe. 

I mean, sometimes all I read is accusations about ""lazy south"" and ""nazi Germans"". I think perhaps that sometimes a bit of stepping back would be in order, and understand that the nature of economics, the theory behind currency unions is what have caused the rapid fall for southern Europe, not anything they have done, explicitly. Think about it, while everything you say about the corruption is true, the corruption in iteself can't call that massive fall, it would more be like a slow decline. 

Unfortunately, the theory behind it also says that you will need massive transfers, and it will take decades....I don't really see that happening, at all, nor can the austerity you live under go on for decades either. I'd recommend leaving the Euro, unfortunately. However, again that might be extra problematic for Greece, due to the corruption. I do not envy your choices.

Think of learning English the same way you would learn Spanish. What do  you need to get by in any foreign country?

First thing could be getting to know someone (Who are you? Where are you from? - Essentially the verb ""to be"" in present. Also, ""Where do you live?"" - Present simple essential verbs)

Then what other skills do you need after that in a foreign country? Buying things (include the numbers here), asking for directions (imperatives), etc. 

Each of these skills could be the theme of each class, and just think of what language you need to teach them (grammar and vocabulary). So, teaching the weather would require vocabulary (maybe bring some pictures, or play pictionary if you can't be bothered/don't have time to do the work) and the questions and answers associated to it (What's the weather like? It's rainy, etc.)

Oh, another good idea to learn verbs is to bring in pictures of people doing things, or act it out (a charades type game, where you mime brushing your teeth, for instance, and they have to guess).

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;There is also the possibility of stronger european integration that will reduce the corruption problems.

That is unfortunately my nightmare. I certainly do not want more integration. I do not want any more people from Brussels taking our money - where are they going and what are they doing? 

Also, with deeper integration means that people that most certainly do not care about Sweden (they only want our money) would decide over us. Why would I want that? 

Also, the ""leadership"", or lack thereof, I have seen in this crises is horrible, as well as the democratic deficit, and the bad economic deciscions. I honestly think our leaders might have done a better job...

Also, if more of the deciscions get made in Brussels, they will (statistically at least) be made by more corrupt people. Why would I want that? 

So, no, I do not want deeper integration. Above all, it will not happen without a popular vote, and I am confident Sweden would vote no (and Finland and Denmark too I believe). 

&gt;Well, in the end there might be less potential for abuse outside the Euro, but mark my words that when that day approaches you'll be surprised by the reaction from certain political groups in Greece (last time this almost happened you had some going from ""no to the euro"" to ""no to the nazist occupationary drachma"" in a matter of days). And it would be risky for the S Europe, but also for the rest of Europe, cause like, they'll lose markets

I do not wish bad things to happen to Greece, not at all, but I do not see how Greece(or Portugla/Spain) can stay in. This austerity will go on for decades- that is not fair toward a country, not at all. 

I hope it will not be to hard.

Check out local food and espacially Döner, Currywurst, Bratwurst, Sauerkraut, Blaukraut, Knödel, all kinds of Braten, etc.! And as a side note: Ask people if they speak english before talking to them in english. A lot of (mostly young) people speak english. But a lot of people get pissed if you just assume that they speak english. I dont know why, justnmy experience. Also, if you have time, visit places like Würzburg or Heidelberg. My friend from the states really liked that old buildings.
Have a great trip!
