Imagine for a second that every country in the Eurozone manages to have a trade surplus. Now, the rest of the world will start becoming more and more indebted to the Eurozone. You think this is good?

Or in other words. Make money on the expense of the people who actually work and create value with their work. If a bank sold bad investment to some carpenter in Denmark and then they bet against him then all that happened is that the bank made money with their great innovative and creative financial product (bad investment repackaged somehow) at the expense of a carpenter who actually made a product that other people bought and that has value in the real world.

true,[deleted],null,null,"  I agree that certain wealth transfers should be placed, to compensate for the snowball effect the ""Blue Banana"" has on the rest of Europe, now that trade barriers and certain subsidies cannot be placed. But to do just and only this is idiotic.

 Nobody would deny that there is something rotten with the political and regulatory environments of Southern and Eastern European countries. Germany managed to gain an advantage in the past 70 years, starting from roughly the same level as everyone else, war torn. Throw in the cost of unification and the advantage shouldn't be that great, but it is. And it did what everyone else was doing, protected its internal market and allowed it to grow to export. It just did it better, consistently. This sort of deficit in decision making has to be addressed. Italy and Spain shouldn't be the political midgets that they currently are on the European Stage, but they are.  

Secondly, there is a problem which is clear yet no one seems to address it. Northern Africa and the Levant are our nearest non-European Markets that Southern and Eastern Europe are in a position to tap, and their dirt poor. They are also unstable. This should be addressed, but the current ideas are either to ignore them completely or invade them. There is an intellectual bankruptcy in how best to deal with this region, and an unwillingness to see their prosperity linked to our own, and that hurts all of us.

Simply put, this call to blame the Germans misses the problem. We're all thinking too bloody small. For half a decade the politicos have been fucking around with deals while all the markets wanted was some symbolic assurance that the Eurozone won't blow up and they can continue business as usual. Now we're asking for state welfare while the well-to-do countries are being hesitant, and clearly the necessary compromise is the creation of some sort of social contract and thus further integration, parish the thought, all the while blaming the Germans for offering good products at low prices, sinful creatures that they are.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; If Germany was still using the Mark, the value of its currency would rise making its exports more expensive and give every other country chance to compete

That would be the case if Germany would export wines, olives, and clothing. However the thing is that Germany actually isn't competing that much with other Eurozone economies. Yes France, UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Finland companies compete with German companies, but they also take part to the manufacturing those German exports, so do eastern European countries. No, the German competitors largely come from the US, Japan and China, from around the world.

The reason especially southern economies are in trouble is not because Germany, but largely because Chinese producers have taken over their markets, for example textile and clothing manufacturing has taken a large hit in south and as those economies are very rigid, they haven't been able to create new industrial sectors and jobs from them.

The plain matter of the fact is that our world has globalized in the last 20 years with so fast that many economies haven't able to keep pace.

The thresholds on current account imbalances are currently set at +/- 4 percent of GDP. Meanwhile the current account surplus threshold is currently set at 6 percent of GDP.

See you're trying to paint this as some sort of moral tale. Except the nordic population is half that of Spain, Norway is oil rich, Sweden spent the war selling material to both sides, and Iceland made its wealth through clever banking. All were rather unexceptional a hundred years ago, all their economies developed at the same time as all the central powers were recovering from a big war.

Did I mention that Southern and Eastern European countries have shown a lack of proper decision making, yes. But does that mean that initial advantages don't apply, no. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer and being generally good ol' folk doesn't come into it. So leave the fucking indignation at home and have some sense of community. Isn't that what the nordic model is all about?

The thing is that Nordic countries are all sparsely populated, they have small home markets, high transport costs to everywhere, harsh climate that makes agriculture and living expensive, etc... The thing is that Nordic countries have become successful even thought their natural handicaps. The same can and should be expected from other countries. 

For example you mention that southern European have poor southern neighbors. So what? We live in a global world, transport costs are nothing, and even if transport costs make exports of physical products impossible to some places, you can always export your knowledge by sourcing manufacturing to happen in countries were you export. News flash for you, H&amp;M doesn't manufacture their cloths in Sweden and Nokia doesn't assemble their phones in Finland.

For example lets look at just some figures...

GDP per capita in (1990 US dollar) 1900...

* UK 4 492
* Germany, 2 985
* Spain 1 786
* Finland, 1 668

And after the war in 1960...

* UK, 8 645
* Germany, 7 705
* Spain, 3 072
* Finland, 6 230

And before the financial crisis...

* UK, 23 742
* Germany, 20 801
* Spain, 19 706
* Finland, 24 344

The thing in here is that countries that have low GDP per capita can and will catch up those with higher production, if they make right decisions and nourish a culture that advantages business, development, entrepreneurship and efficiency. Can you really argue that the reason why Finland has created companies like Nokia, Kone or Supercell (a start-up that just sold half of itself to Japanease investors with 1,1 billion Euro) to be all related to some initial advantage? For crying out loud, Finland was the poorest of these four countries in the 1900; got into a bloody civil war after independence; fought in the second world war in the loosing side loosing approx 14% of its land area; has to resettle approx 10% of people relocated from lost lands; etc... Poor don't get poorer, and rich don't necessarily keep being rich, it all depends on what happens, what kind of decisions are being made.

The reason why many regions in Finland have been suffering in the last two decades is because they haven't been able to renew themselves. They have either been stuck on the mentality that a factory will provide, or that the state will provide, when in fact they should have done more work to inspire entrepreneurial attitude, to make people take risks, to make people to renew themselves.

And do so whilst engaging in none of the normal solidarity acts that nation states engage in to normalise wealth potential within regions:

Federal US taxation is ~25% of GDP and the variation in spending levels between rich and poor states is ~5% of GDP, so a variation of roughly 20% of federal spending.

How big a budget would the EU need to be able to slosh around 5% of combined GDP into the poor regions (bearing in mind the current budget is only 1% (and heavily constrained by CAP payments)?

The other point is that americans accept this, they are all american, whereas we are rapidly finding out just how german the germans are, and finnish the finns are, when it comes to firehosing cash at nations they consider to be essentially delinquent! In the UK this ‘sloshing’ occurs in the form of:

a) National pay-bargaining which benefits poorer regions (teachers, nurses, etc)

b) National social benefits more generous than poorer regions could afford alone (eg.housing benefit in glasgow)

c) Targeted regional development grants/discounts to encourage business growth (objective 1 EU/WEFO funds)

d) Additional infrastructure spending to support the local economy (the mainland-skye bridge)

e) Operating national services hubs from depressed regions to boost wages (DVLA in swansea, etc)

Unless Germany recognises the ‘familial’ relationship, and the obligation that goes along with that, then it needs to leave for the good of its neighbours.

This principal applies equally to the netherlands and finland, but since it is Germany that is the driving economic power for the euro’s sake the answer must be ‘right’.

One mechanism to equalise this foriegn exchange disparity would be eurobonds. To compensate for a higher than natural foriegn exchange rate the wider currency union would borrow collectively, and thus lower their borrowing costs on the back of Germany's strength.

The quid-pro-quo would be that Germany's cost of borrowing would rise, as it too would be borrowing through the wider currency union and would see its strength diluted in consequence.

That's wrong.

C'est avant tout un chant de sacrifice, où l'individu-soldat se donne pour la République (cf le couplet dit *Des Enfants* par exemple).


*A Table, Citoyens, videz tous vos flacons;*

*Buvez, Buvez, qu'un vin bien pur abreuve vos poumons!*

C'est sûr que ça c'est plus populaire, plus motivant et beaucoup chanté également dans nos campagnes dès 1792. 

Le texte aborde un point intéressant mais est un peu faiblard et surtout pas de sources!

La question du ""sang impur"" (un probable plagiat de Rouget de Lisle d'un poème anti Anglais du XVIIIe) partage les historiens eux-mêmes: l'obsession de la noblesse européenne de la pureté du sang penche pour l'une des interprétations. Mais d'un autre côté, s'ils commençaient à voir de la Lumière, nos ancêtres révolutionnaires n'étaient pas forcément aussi éclairés que nous le sommes sur la question des ethnies, des nations, des races..

Il reste que la Marseillaise est un chant très violent..mais la fondation et la défense de la République n'ont pas été une partie de plaisir. Et ce chant est là pour nous le rappeler. D'ailleurs notre hymne officieux, *Le Chant des Partisans* est autrement plus violent (""Ohé les Tueurs à la balle et au couteau, Tuez vite!"") mais bien moins discuté.

Je vrai sens de notre hymne tient dans le 5e couplet, qui d'ailleurs vient éclairer le sang impur d'une autre couleur (plutôt bleu donc):

*Français, en guerriers magnanimes,*

*Portez ou retenez vos coups !*

*Épargnez ces tristes victimes,*

*À regret s'armant contre nous.*

Go to the prado. It's some of the best art you'll see in the world and it's free to go in as a student with an ID.

I also agree with what another poster wrote: 100 montadidos will fill you up deliciously and cheaply. Just order a bunch of those tiny sandwiches and a big beer and it's one of the cheapest and most delicious meals you'll have.

Most places in Madrid will give you food with every drink you get, as long as you're not too picky with food because they just give you whatever. You can get a lot of food for just the price of your drink.

One place in particular that gives you plenty of food with a drink is a place called La Camocha Sidreria. There are two locations on a street called fuencarral. You can get delicious cider and they give you plenty of food for free just with your drink.

Any place in the area just south of plaza del sol will give you a good amount of food with a drink.

From Madrid you can take a bus for about 5€ to a place called El Escorial which is a nice town with an old monastery with an art museum in the mountains. Also free/reduced admission for students. The bus leaves from Moncloa on the west side of town.

Also Toledo is relatively cheap and easy to get to by train or bus. And once you get there and walk around, most of the museums aren't worth going to but the city itself is gorgeous and you can spend a day just exploring ever nook and cranny. The cathedral Toledo would be the one thing you should pay admission to if you must. It is absolutely gorgeous.

TL;DR: Prado free with student ID. Eat meals by just ordering drinks and getting the free tapa. Toledo and El Escorial.

Also watch the Rick Steve's Europe about Madrid, Toledo and Barcelona for more tips. Most of them are on YouTube.

So yeah, cannabis should be legal to consume but the stigma is too strong for that to happen. Many politicians flat out reject the notion that drugs can be classified into different categories.

In the Euro-zone: Germany is expected to buy more southern European goods or straight transfer capital. In China: they are expected to revalue their currency and stop lending to their state owned companies at low interest rates (forgetting, ofcourse, that many Western countries subsidize labour and agriculture).

How about instead of crippling competative countries and expecting them to revalue their currencies or enter transfer unions, they take what works and adapt it to their own countries.

Germany has large state owned banks and corporatist labour and economic structure, and China is simmilar (except more corporations are state owned). And yet Eastern and Southern Europe is forced to sell their state owned companies and break up their labour forces and cut public spending.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt;Die Gesellschaften des Westens, wie sie sich heute präsentieren, sind im Grunde allesamt kapitalistische bürgerlich-demokratische Nationalstaaten, die mit nicht-demokratischen Staaten, aber auch miteinander im militärischen, ergo ökonomischen Konkurrenzkampf stehen. Profitpresserei, d.h. die Ausbeutung der Arbeiter, ist hier ein wichtiges Mittel zur Steigerung der eigenen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit.

Mein Punkt ist, dass das Ergebnis des Revisionismusstreits der Standpunkt war, dass die damalige Form der Arbeiterpartei die falschen Ansätze hat.

Die neuen Ansätze der aus dem Revisionismus entstehenden Sozialdemokraten hatten nämlich im Gegensatz zum damaligen Marxismus ganz andere Ansätze:

Zusammengefasst waren die Reformisten der Ansicht, dass ein Klassenkampf inkl. dem Mittel der revolution zur Veränderung der Gesellschaft kontraproduktiv und falsch sind. Ihrem Namen entsprechend wollten sie Reformen anstreben, statt Revolution.

Dannach ist ein maßgeblicher Unterschied, dass nicht eine Wirtschaftsordnung nach Marx angestrebt werden sollte, sondern die Lebensverhältnisse des Arbeiters auch im Kapitalismus verbessert werden können.

Und all diese Maxime trifft man im Allgemeinen heute auch noch in der SPD an, da diese aus den Reformsozialisten hervorging, die andern Marxisten haben sich abgespalten und sind heute eh nicht mehr erwähnenswert, da sie im Laufe der Geschichte im Prinzip untergingen.

Die Linke, welche heute noch nennenswerte Wähleranteile besitzt, orientiert sich heute wohl auch größtenteils an einer Art Reformismus, auch wenn is wohl noch einige ideologische Marxisten (lies: Knallköppe) in ihr gibt.

Lässt sich alles auch relativ verständlich im Netz nachlesen, falls wer an der Geschichte des deutschen Sozialismus/demokartischem Sozialismus interessiert ist. Einfach mal nach Revisionsmus/Eduard Bernstein usw. suchen.

Schlussendlich in der Gegenwart angekommen behaupte ich nun, dass unsere demokratisch-sozialistischen Genossen von der SPD trotz alledem -und auch trotz bspw. des Seeheimer Kreises- eine Arbeiterpartei sind.

Wer sich ihr aktuelles Wahlprogramm anschaut sieht, dass ihr Programm eindeutig dem einer demokratisch-sozialistischen und reformistischen Arbeiterpartei entspricht. Auch wenn ihr Wahlprogramm leider in Koalitionsverträgen mit der Union beschnitten werden wird.

Wem das Programm der SPD, geschweige denn der Linken nicht weit genug geht, um sie als Arbeiterpartei anzusehen -wer also Reformismus als gesellschaftsverändernde Kraft ablehnt und stattdessen Revolution als logischerweise einzige verbleibende Alternative wählt- der ist schlicht und ergreifend auf dem falschen Dampfer.

Zu den Überlegungen jetzt meine Schlussfolgerungen im Sinne des demokratischen Sozialismus:

&gt;Produktionsmittel nach wie vor das Eigentum weniger Reicher.

Demensprechend is das dann irrelevant, bzw is ein Ansatz die Tatsache, dass die Produktionsmittel der Großindustriellen sich auch auf den Mittelstand verteilten, d.h. die Zahl der Vermögenden wird imer größer.

&gt;Profitpresserei, d.h. die Ausbeutung der Arbeiter,

Sowas soll ja dann durch Sozialhilfe gelöst werden. Das einzige, was uns gefehlt hat war ja ein verbindlicher Mindestlohn, der die Zustände der letzten 8 Jahre verhindert hätte (sprich Aufstocker). Frag mich nicht, wieso der nicht gleich in die Agenda2010 eingebaut wurde, vllt weil man ja tarifliche Mindestlöhne schon hatte, nicht so weit gedacht hatte, oder einfach dachte, dass der politische Widerstand zu groß war, oder zu viele ökonomische Berater davon abrieten.

Jedenfalls haben wir ihn demnächst und wer dann sagt, es tut niemand was für die Arbeiter, der labert einfach.

&gt;(bzw. dass die Sozialdemokraten eine Verräterpartei sei, da sie den Konservativen und Liberalen an neoliberaler Politik in nichts nachsteht)

Das mit dem Neoliberalismus is mehr oder weniger ziemlich billige Polemik und entrpsricht auch gar nicht mal so der Wahrheit. Mal abgesehn davon, dass man in einigen bereichen ""neoliberal"" sein könnte und trotzdem Sozialpolitik machen kann.

&gt;Urproblem des Leidens der Arbeiterklasse, nämlich die kapitalistische Produktionsweise, im Grunde unverändert fortbesteht.

Es geht doch um das Ausmaß. Vergleich mal die industrielle Revolution und heute. Und jetzt überleg mal, wieso Reformen besser geeignet sind, als Revolution, Bürgerkrieg/Krieg und dann einen erkämpften Kommunismus der dem arbeiter auch nicht hilft.

Heute sind die ehemaligen Arbeiter aufgestiegen und das nicht wegen Kommunistischen Revolutionen und kommunistischer Sozialpolitk, sondern wegen sozialdemokratischen reformen _im Kapitalismus_.

&gt;Eine wie auch immer geartete Arbeiterpartei könnte im gegenwärtigen System auf Dauer gar keine arbeiterfreundliche Politik betreiben,

Das sehe ich auf jeden Fall nicht so.

**tl;dr:** selbstverständlich gibt es deutsche Arbeiterparteien, nur sind SPD -und Linke im Prinzip auch- reformistisch. Von der revolution und dem Klassenkampf könnter euch verabschieden.

I understand this line of thought, but that means nobody can criticize anyone else. I mean, there were European leaders telling the US that its economic policies were creating too much debt, and that debt would be bad for American growth. Should America have told them to fuck off just because a few European countries have higher debt/gdp ratios than us? No, it was valid criticism.

Plus, this isn't just the US criticizing Germany. The same thing was said in the British press, and Italy has stepped up its criticism of Germany's policies. So should they all shut the hell up until their economies are stronger, and their debt has been cleaned up? Why is it that criticism from outsiders is always reviled (that's not just a German thing, every time I see one country criticize another countries economic policies, the response is always ""Shut up until your house is in order"")

I understand why you would think that way, but I think it prevents one from really considering the merit in those critiques.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; NASA notoriously doesn't allow any Chinese involvement.

Yep, but don't blame NASA, blame politicians and especially Frank Wolf. The NASA leadership, NASA scientists, and even Obama would want to do more open cooperation also with China.

But the congress, especially republicans and NASA Committee chairman Frank Wolf are heavily opposed to such and have led the congress to broadly ban NASA from doing **any** cooperation with the Chinese state, any Chinese company, and also prohibited hosting Chinese visitors.

Which is ridiculous, hurts the science and has led to silly situations. For example NASA scientists cannot participate to relevant meetings with Chinese engineers and researchers. So sometimes when the Chinese enter the NASA guys have to leave, so the Chinese scientists are left to discuss rocketry and space science only with people from ESA, Roscosmos etc.

The idiotic situation has even resulted frustrated US scientists to boycott a NASA conference about exoplanets: [US scientists boycott Nasa conference over China ban](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/05/us-scientists-boycott-nasa-china-ban)

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"I think the answer is actually a little bit more practical than simply 'tradition' or 'because people like them'. In my experience with Europe's constitutional monarchies, the main tangible benefit (speaking for myself) is that you have a country with an apolitical head of state that does not represent any political party, ethnic group or other faction (as an American dual citizen, I wonder what America would be like if presidents weren't actively hated by at least half the country). I think that's quite important for countries regardless of whether or not they've got a tumultuous history. And yes, before anyone says it, I know the president of Ireland is a similar figurehead. But the idea that the Queen in the UK doesn't represent Labour, or the Conservatives, but ONLY the people of the country is quite an important thing for any country to have. In addition, armed forces swear allegiance to the Queen and not the government. I like that as well - they're working for someone whose job is to care about their wellbeing, not someone who cares about making a name for themselves.

In addition, and again this is only me speaking, but I think the concept of a living royal family makes that nation's symbols and historical traditions feel more 'authentic', so to speak. You can often tell where certain things like flags, emblems, logos, traditions, national anthems etc. were created by politicians of the 'new republic' not so long ago as a way of making a clean break with their past, particularly in countries that went from monarchy to socialism. However, in the UK for example, nothing seems disingenuine about the royal standard, or the coat of arms, or the regnal seal, or the national anthem, because they're ancient standards upholding a tradition that exists today. It's rather difficult for me to explain properly as it's more of a feeling than an objective appraisal, but perhaps you see what I mean.

EDIT: for what it's worth, here's a comprehensive list of monarchies in Europe:

* Andorra (co-principality with royal duties split between the Bishop of Urgell, elected by the Pope, and the sitting President of France, which makes François Hollande both the president of a republic and co-prince of a principality)
* Belgium
* Denmark
* Liechtenstein
* Luxembourg
* Monaco
* The Netherlands
* Norway
* Spain
* Sweden
* United Kingdom

And we need more robots, as in ... more by a factor of 100 or 1000! And we also need three or four more space telescopes ... at least a thousand times more powerful than Hubble. We have the tech, what are we waiting for? And we need to start readying permanent bases on our nearby moon. And many more such things. 

As for the cost, you write:

&gt;*Sadly, space stations are extremely expensive and take funding away from other fields of research and science projects ...*

Europe's total member-state budget is about 6500 billion € (give or take an couple hundred billion). The ESA's budget is a laughable pittance considering. The only reason projects like the space station ""*take funding away from other fields*"" is that funding for all these fields is a joke.

This needs to change.

It all depends on why one country is more competitive than the other. Free Trade Agreements are a matter of trust and fair competition (level playing field), which obviously cannot happen as long as China continues to favour national champions, among other things. This means that those companies ""cannot lose"" because they represent their country and have close ties to the government, enabling them to get massive state support, distorting competition. This happened a lot with Chinese companies like Suntech: the government did everything they could to keep them from failing, even though natural selection said they should fall.

China is expected to revalue their currency because there is evidence that it is being kept low (they even have official ForEx trading restrictions to prevent it from rising too much) artificially. Of course, as you suggested, the EU could start doing the same (so as to avoid ""crippling competitive countries"" LOL), but that would turn it all into an onslaught of beggar-thy-neighbor policies and general retardedness that would turn it even more into a zero-sum game, and that's a really bad situation to sign Free Trade Agreements in.  


&gt; How about a bit more state planning and intervention instead of privatising everything and sending profits over seas?

That means no more FTAs and less globalisation, which in turn has been proven to mean less growth.

Per cui è un fenomeno del tutto superficiale, di cui si considerano solo le stramberie tutte matte, ma non si va oltre quello.

E questo tipo di approccio poi produce mostri come il nostro amico del video, che dice di essere nerd perché scarica con Adunanza (chi lo fa più, mi chiedo), e riduce tutto ad un elenco di banalate condite da un namedropping spesso pure sbagliato (i cosplay di cui sopra).

è come se tutta la rielaborazione che si è fatta negli ultimi anni del concetto di nerd e/o geek nella cultura pop (penso anche solo al film the Social Network), ci sia passata sopra la testa, per cui ci troviamo ancora fermi ad una visione da La Rivincita dei Nerd (solo così si spiega l'esistenza di un programma tipo la pupa e il secchione).

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"&gt; You complain about the german president being a anonymous figurehead but then argue that the danish monarch is good because he has no political power?

Then you misunderstand me. I wasn't complaining that they have no power. I was saying that if you are to have a head of state with no political power you might as well have one that has value by the traditions it has and the valuable place it has in the cultural heritage of the country. A president has none of this, so it would be a loss to install a president instead of a monarch.

Unless of course you want a presidential system, where the president has a lot of political power and can interfere with the work of the parliament. In that case you'd have a role that a constitutional monarch cannot fullfill, since you can obviously not have unelected persons wielding so much power in a democracy.

However, I am not a fan of presidential systems and the gridlocks that often results from them (See the US, for example). So in my view if we should become a republic it should be a republic like the German one, where the president has no power and is a figure head. But in that case we might as well keep our monarchy, due to the beforementioned reasons. 

&gt; I think they still have some power - their word has some kind of power for example. Formal power isn't everything.

They are strictly non-political. The last time the monarch tried to wield power we almost became a republic. See: [Easter crisis of 1920](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Crisis_of_1920).

I can find you more sources if you want. The reason they all have old sources is because Skatteverket (Swedish Tax Agency) stopped collecting information on wealth in 2007. The reason being the government removed the wealth tax in that year.

Haha, it is indeed a pretty horrible comparison because I really don't see any similarities. A completely powerless and non-political head of state, as the Danish monarch is, compared to an all powerful head of state with complete control of the political and economic system and the military, as Hitler was.

Edit: I see that you are German, so I understand where you are coming from and what your worry is. But that is simply a cultural difference between Denmark and Germany, due to our different historical experiences.

&gt; A monarch is just another symbol to me. You can change hymns, currencies, political systems and even attributes of civilians over a longer time - why not change the head of state? It's just another symbol.

Well, what a monarch is to you doesn't really matter, to put it frankly, since you're not Danish and thus not raised with any of the culture and history which gives the Danish monarchy meaning to most Danish people. In the case of Denmark what matters is what the monarch means to the Danish people (And you could say the same about any of the countries with constitutional monarchies out there).

It puts more of the policy at the belt buckles of those it directly affects, and makes policy less detached.  So decidedly less authoritarian and corruption/waste less easy.

When we apply the same standards it means putting local people more  in control of local matters in the stead of large, centralised diktat.

Understand that a 'populist' party that argues for *civic* national-statism is considerably less authoritarian than somebody arguing for EU fedralist nationalism.  The federalist argument simply trades up for a greater nationalist identity.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"&gt; To be honest - the thought that the army swears on a monarch horrifies me.

Sounds a bit like an extreme reaction to me. It's a symbolic gesture, saying the military swear allegiance to the person who embodies the whole of the nation, as opposed to a politican with their own agenda. Parliament still calls the shots - the Queen can't just declare war and send troops into battle on a whim.

&gt; Basically this answer is also an answer to your comment. 
&gt; ""A monarch is just another symbol to me. You can change hymns, currencies, political systems and even attributes of civilians over a longer time - why not change the head of state? It's just another symbol.""

But everything is just a symbol. An elected politician is just a symbol, and one with a limited shelf life. My name is just a symbol. Everything is just a symbol. 

&gt; And if you wanted to make the argument ""others also do it"" - then I will not accept that because it's one of the most horrible arguments ever.

I don't want to make that argument. At all. What I was trying to imply is that I believe it is better to have a head of state who represents the interests of the country as a whole rather than a partisan politican who represents his or her voting base, and for whom a substantial part of the country did not vote.

&gt; I'll stick to it: Traditions are meant to be broken.

Always? As a blanket rule? At what point is something old enough that it becomes 'tradition' and must immediately be replaced? 100 years? 200 years? I'm glad that the tradition of slavery was ended, and it's now global tradition to *not* have slavery. Pretty soon, not having slavery will be tradition. Do we bring back slavery then because emancipation is too mainsteam?

I don't see why you're so hellbent on getting rid of anything and everything for the sake of it, especially since I explained that it's my belief that a politically neutral and unelected head of state (NOT head of government) is preferable to having a partisan politican in charge. That's not tradition, it's a good idea and one that has worked for constitutional monarchies for a while now. I'm not saying that the Queen should get back all her powers and abolish Parliament!

&gt; PS: The british mockup looks interesting because both sides have their design - however I think that the side with the number always have to be the same (but I'm not sure).

...but those mockups *did* have the standard Euro design on the number side. The queen was only on the obverse, the reverse is the normal side that all Euro coins have.

First, you are profoundly mistaken if you think this breaks down as a traditional liberal/conservative, Dem/Repub issue in the U.S. It isn't. For example, I'm a liberal Democrat. That said, I'm not against the U.S. cyber-surveillance program. In fact, I want us to have the world's most powerful intelligence capabilities to spy on any nation or individual, anytime or any place, and I'm glad we do. Like (I think) most Americans, I just want it directed at the right targets (i.e. let's spy on Putin a little more, and on the German chancellor a little less), and given the proper amount of oversight.

Second, I'm not worried about the Europeans. The EU can't even agree which side of their bread to butter in the morning without a 2-year fact finding panel, let alone on European-wide regulation or policy responses to anything. European states and the US are too intertwined economically, politically and militarily to step back from that relationship now. Sure, we might see some minor policy setbacks (the trade deal, for example, or Safe Harbor, etc.), and we might not be able to twist arms on diplomatic issues as effectively, but that's about it. The U.S. is too powerful and influential to not engage with deeply, and it'll always be in the EU's interest to do so.

Third, I think you're probably an angsty youth who lacks judgment or any sense of perspective if you seriously believe that there's any parallel between a open, liberal democracy like the U.S. and China or Russia.

And I can assure you that Japan will *exactly as much* be arsed to adjust their economy to become less competitive in their prime exports than Germany: Not at all.

Greece will have to sweat out its corruption and find its high-margin niche to excel in, there's no way around that. In the meantime, there's ample of Romanians that would be glad to have the average Greek's problems.

DnB, jungle, industrial e ""IDM"" (virgoletto perche' non mi piace il termine). Ma sono cresciuto con il punk e l'80% del mio iTunes e' comunque formato da gente che registra sotto Epitaph e Fat Wreck Chords. Aggiungici poi un fetish verso i Metallica degli albori.

I actually read it knowing the reforms that are being advocated!

I 'read stuff' in context, not according to what I want, or what somebody dreams of, but what is actually being proposed and where the direction is!

The reforms, the direction, is not selective reading on my part but selective myopia on your part.

&gt;The new reforms for voting actually allow for direct election of a EU president,

Rather they allow a percentage of European national leaders to override other national leaders in the council where they have had, up until now, the security in most regards of unanimity.

&gt;I can't believe you're saying it's worse when it actually takes into consideration many gripes people have with the voting system.

Selective gripes, and only to ever (as always) progress a certain avenue of political thought i.e. federalism.

*THAT'S* the reason why people are now suddenly panicking about a sudden popularism on the left, right, and centre.  They've stopped listening to the people; be it ACTA, or the Constitution, or calls for real reform away from political union, and pushed it away and when suddenly people are saying 'No' they try to assume that they have a monopoly on what the EU means and what it stands for.

It would be a international *tour de force* if Snowden returned and faced fair trial, especially if he were to be acquitted.

The question is, how does the United States do this in such a way that Germany or any other country can trust them?

Perhaps one day you, and your countrymen, will be able to look at America again and see her as a true partner and ally.

Perhaps the first step to that day will come when Snowden is afforded a fair trial in the United States.

I'll leave you with a favorite quote of mine from one of the greatest jurists to ever sit on the American Supreme Court:

*""Decency, security and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that, in the administration of the criminal law, the end justifies the means -- to declare that the Government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal -- would bring terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this Court should resolutely set its face.""*

It also has a few people whose job it is to do more policy-oriented tasks. 

The Commission on the other hand is staffed mostly by generalists who provide policy guidance and handle the political side of things, for example getting the right resolutions through the Council and European Parliament. The Commission was able to negotiation for a dramatic increase in the EU budget funds dedicated to Europe's space activities via the Horizon 2020 plan compared to the previous 7 year period (2007-2013). This has helped cover some of the shortfalls experienced by the ESA, as noted in this thread. The Commission also has some engineers on staff to liaison properly with the ESA.

* They've never beaten us in football since independence :P

* Italy has, through various periods and to various extents, held large parts of the eastern Adriatic. Venice held a lot of it for a long time, Italy proper held the far north (Istria, Rijeka, and a few islands) during the interwar period and occupied the rest during WWII. A personal anecdote on this, my grandmother completed her secondary education in an Italian school in occupied Dalmatia.

* Rijeka has several Italian primary schools and one secondary school. Instruction, with presumably the exception of Croatian language class, is exclusively in Italian.

* All of Istria has bilingual signs.

* The coast uses quite an extensive list of Italian loanwords. Some are modified, some are just about the same.

* Rijeka (Fiume at the time/in Italian) experienced fascism (or perhaps proto-fascism) at the hand of Gabrielle D'Annunzio before the rest of Italy got Mussolini. [Wiki article] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Regency_of_Carnaro)

* While not particularly great, Italian occupation was far less perilous than German occupation during WWII. When Italy surrendered in 1943, the Germans scrambled to fill the power vacuum in the east Adriatic areas and established a far harsher regime. Deportations of suspected anti-fascists grew exponentially, counter-insurgency and reprisals on civilian populations became a reality, and industrial centers fell prey to indiscriminate allied bombings.

The composer Monteverdi's (15 May 1567 (baptized) – 29 November 1643) work, often regarded as revolutionary, marked the transition from the Renaissance style of music to that of the Baroque period. He developed two individual styles of composition – the heritage of Renaissance polyphony and the new basso continuo technique of the Baroque. Monteverdi wrote one of the earliest operas, L'Orfeo, an innovative work that is still regularly performed. He was recognized as an innovative composer and enjoyed considerable fame in his lifetime.

true,I_HOPE_YOU_ALL_DIE,null,null,"- There is a sharp divide between a ""rich"" north and a very poor south that is all but overrun by criminal organizations. 

- Talking about criminal organizations, not all Italian gangs are called Mafia. Mafia is exclusively a Sicilian thing. Gangs from other regions have different names such as 'Ndrangeta (Calabria), Sacra Corona Unita (Puglia), Camorra (Campania) and Anonima Sarda (Sardinia). One thing they have in common is that they are all equally scum and  represent the worst of the worst that humanity has to offer. 

- More crime... In 2005 Bernardo Provenzaro was finally arrested after he'd not been seen since the mid 60's. He had effectively become the ""boss of all bosses""after Totó Riina had been arrested a few years earlier. A black and white photograph from that time was all that the police had until he was discovered to have traveled to France in 2002 to receive medical care - this also provided proof that he was in fact still alive. He was arrested in a farm not far from his hometown. 

- Italy also has a bloated bureaucratic system that was implemented as little more than a wealth redistribution mechanism. Whole government agencies - such as the infamous Cassa Del Mezzogiorno - were completely useless and only served as a way to generate employment in areas where private investment was lacking. The fact that access to these jobs was pretty much controlled by the same criminals that kept private business away means that these projects did not work as planned. 

- Italians love motor sports. Italy is home to Ferrari, Lamborghini, Ducati and MV Augusta to name a few. Many of these have a strong racing background. Probably the most famous Italian currently involved in motor sports is Valentino Rossi, who won just about anything that can be won on a motorcycle. 

- Back in the 90's Berlusconi's media empire was threatened when he was taken to court for breaking broadcasting laws by having 3 national TV channels - I think back then privates were only allowed to have 1. The case was thrown out because technically speaking Mediaset (Berlusconi's TV channels) channels are broadcast by several local TV stations - that were bought one by one in the 80's - that all just happen to broadcast the same programs at the same time.

When talking about the magnates they had their own private armies, one of their favourite pastimes between XVIth and XVIIth century was conquering parts of Russia and putting their own candidates on the throne, that's the power I am talking about. They wanted to be in power, so they wanted weaker kings. Each chosen king had to guarantee the privileges granted by the previous kings and add something atop of that. An example of such privileges, granted centuries before, was inability to introduce new taxes without agreement of the knights. It included taxes in times of war. As more power went to the nobility the more important sejms(think of it like parliament's meeting) became. Due to some unclear events it became possible for a single nobleman to dissolve these meetings, and in a hundred or so years they were dissolved once every couple of years. The noblemen who were in debt were 'bought' by magnates or other members of nobility to dissolve meetings they didn't want to happen.

-  Italians love football and they are pretty good at it. All big teams however are based in the north. The last time a southern team won the Serie A championship was in 1990 when Naples placed first largely thanks to the amazing skills of Argentinian player Diego Armando Maradona. Nowadays Napolitans consider Maradona just above Jesus in terms of capacity for performing miracles.    

- Naples is a very peculiar place indeed. Famous for being a scammer's paradise, inventing pizza and being built on the side of a volcano that will sooner or later erase it from the face of earth.  It's dialect is unlike that spoken by any of their neighbors. Napolitans are unique for their creativity and fatalist approach to life. Around Christmas, Napolitans like to create intricate and somewhat flamboyant nativity scenes. These do not include merely traditional bible characters but also modern figures such as politicians, celebrities and indeed Maradona.

- Among Italy's most well known inventions is false flag terrorism. This tactic was used extensively by neo-fascist groups during the Anni di Piombo (Years of Lead) in an attempt to convince the government to crack down on leftists and impose a form of government more akin to their ideological background.

In WW1:

Italy, Germany and Austria-Hungary had a defensive pact. Which would mean that if Germany or Austria got attacked we needed to help you. However, you guys turned it from a defensive pact into an attacking one so we no longer felt bound to participate in you aggressive conquests. So we fought on the side we saw as right.

In WW2. Pietro Badoglio took control over the kingdom of Italy. Something German officers had tried but failed. However if the Germans had succeeded they would be ""heroes"" however we are traitors.

After the capitulation of the Kingdom of Italy the Italian forces in Russia and Greece and Yugoslavia were disarmed, their weapons were given to the Nazis as a last act of friendship. We capitulated but tried to help you with the little we had. The Italian soldiers were slaughtered on their way back to Italy by the Nazis. Maybe that is why we declared war on Nazi Germany.

Not to mention that in 1943 Mussolini announced Repubblica di Salo in Northern Italy. While the Americans and the Southerners were advancing North, the Germans and the Northern Italians were fighting back for two years. Brothers turned against brothers. Two fucking years. For every village, for every field. For a lost war. With you.

Eventually all of Italy capitulated on the 27 April of 1945, just a few days before Germany with the death of Mussolini.

true,goerz,ITAL,Italy,"Yes, I'm from Friuli. And despite popular opinion, Slavic or Germanic heritage is not as common as you might believe, because the major migrations in Italy happened during the neolithic period, and what happened later had a relatively small effect on the population's genetics. From [wikipedia's genetic history of Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_history_of_Italy):


Migrations that occurred on Italian soil from the fall of the Roman Empire until 1000 AD have probably not significantly altered the gene pool of the Italian people.[8] Despite the lengthy Goth and Lombard presence in Italy, it is estimated that the I1 haplogroup associated with the Germanic peoples is only present among Italians in the north in the order of 2-3% and from 1 to 1.5% among Italians in the south.[9]
Other haplotypes that could have been penetrated in Italy together with the German invaders are haplogroup R1a which belongs to 2.5% of Italians and some subclades of the R1b Haplogroup (in particular the subclade R1b1c9 that owns 3.5% of Italians [10] and is particularly widespread among the peoples of north-west Italy) but because these haplogroups are just mentioned fairly commonly in other European ethnic groups it is difficult to establish whether they have been really brought into Italy by Germanic peoples or by other peoples (e.g. Slavs). The Germanic or Nordic heritage among the Italians then wanders around 5-10%.



My Y-DNA haplotype is R1a, subclade Z280, originated in the Carpathians. Not common at all in Italy. I know this because I took the [National Geographic's Genographic DNA test](https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/), because I have a great interest in history and I was curious.

I know my last name is a derivation of a Germanic first name, as many Italian last names are. It constitutes no evidence in itself, but paired with genetic testing it becomes another piece of the puzzle of my deep ancestry. But of course I'm just talking about my paternal line, so it's a small percentage of my overall dna. I've had fun anyway researching my origins.

true,the1337tum,NEWZ,New Zealand,"&gt;It all depends on why one country is more competitive than the other. Free Trade Agreements are a matter of trust and fair competition (level playing field), which obviously cannot happen as long as China continues to favour national champions, among other things. This means that those companies ""cannot lose"" because they represent their country and have close ties to the government, enabling them to get massive state support, distorting competition. This happened a lot with Chinese companies like Suntech: the government did everything they could to keep them from failing, even though natural selection said they should fall.

For a long time, under the Brenton Woods System, countries pegged their currencies to the USD; and there are still plenty of countries that continue the practice (the Swiss, for example). As for subsidising national companies: it's their country, and their currency, so what right does the EU (or any other country) have to tell them how to run their country? I would argue - along with Keynesians - that when the economy is in recession, and there is limited private investment, that the government should direct the economy though targeted investments.

Now, I would say it's a bit hypocritical for the US or EU to tell China to revalue their currency, when both are spending trillions on financial instriments (Asset Backed Securities in the US, and Outright Monitary Transactions of bonds in the EU). 

&gt;That means no more FTAs and less globalisation, which in turn has been proven to mean less growth. It's a choice to make but I believe globalisation is, on the whole, a good thing for the EU, even though for some industries it means sending profits overseas. It's actually only fair that foreign companies get to do business here too, which means sending profits overseas. That's normal operation.

Lowering tarriffs is one thing, telling another country how to spend it's money (subsidising research, a particular sector or wages) and putting that in a free trade agreement is quite another. As for your natural selection argument, I fail to understand how you can justify transfering billions to uncompetative states to make them more competative and yet argue against investing in uncompetative industries/businesses until they become more competative.",0,1383352010,null,0,1383352359,0,cd4swdr,t3_1pogom,t1_cd4swdr,t1_cd4ewse,null,1428894212,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It's not a problem of southern and northern Europe being too different to fit together. It's a problem of a lack of effort to create better balance.

&gt;Meanwhile Germany sits on it's ass and tells them to be more like them. The current course of action will never work, it can only end in disaster.

Germany is doing politics for Germany and trying to protect German interests (money). The reason we don't have a big EU-wide economic stimulus and giant investing program co-financed by everyone is because **we are not a political union**.

We have national governments not a European government. Let's suppose such a stimulus program was the economically right thing to do (for theory). There is currently no justification to the German people as to why that should happen. Yes, it might be smarter and all that, but people think in moral terms. Politics has to convince them. 

The only reason West Germany propped up East Germany is because of the common culture, sense of belonging together and responsibility. The tax that financed the build up of East Germany is named ""solidarity premium"". Strong language. This isn't the case for Greece and Germany. It's the job of politics and the whole of society to change that if we want the European project to succeed.

All kidding aside the story is that recently there have been a lot of complaints from Danes about the speech in Danish movies being inaudible because of the actors mumbling or having difficult accents (Danish is a very difficult language to master, and written Danish and spoken Danish differ a lot) so a few major cinemas in Denmark have taken to offering Danish subtitles for Danish movies believed to be hard to understand, which of course was hilarious to us other Nordics who already joke about how hard Danish is to understand, and that now even Danes can't understand it.

In the Friedmaniverse, it seems to be a logical argument that if money is spent by the public, it should be spend like with a watering can so everyone gets the same share.

The Basic Income has several problematic points. It seems to be unfinancable and it would cause a rise in labour costs because it reduces the available workforce. This and a an increasing demand due to the rising purchasing power would would cause a general rise in prices that would equalize the Basic Income, making it useless. The financial problem has often been answered by supporters of this idea wanting to replace the Social System with the Basic Income, but this would cause some groups to fall out of society. Appart from this practical reason, public fund should be used efficiently to create the largest possible benefit. Spending money on unemployed people prevents them from loosing everything. As homeless people are not as likely to get into a sustainable existence again, the public supports the unemployed as the costs of this support are cheaper than the costs of not supporting them.

This can be done by raising prices or reducing maintenance costs by reducing maintenance. While private operators can sometimes underbid a public operator, this does not mean, that they are better at their job. There have been numerous cases in which infrastructures were cashed out by private owners until they were getting disfunctional due to the lack of costly maintenance.
