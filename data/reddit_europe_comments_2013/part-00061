true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"Agreed. I think people fail to realize that if France and Italy band together, they are certainly more important than Germany in the context of the eurozone in many different metrics (population, gdp, combined contributions etc).

It angers me that due to this eurozone crisis, a lot of people have been dissing Italy as if they are some kind of unimportant country, but they have been a **MAJOR** contributor in everything the EU does from the very beginning, and still are. Certainly not a country you want to lose support from, even if you can technically try to argue that you would 'benefit' (in pure numbers, without looking at the fallout and ignoring that it's the stupidest idea ever) from cutting Greece and Spain off.

This ""north vs south"" *propaganda* needs to end. The final Italian election results are *way* more important than anybody thinks. As soon as Italy goes all ""Cyprus"" on the eurozone, the game changes extremely fast -- they may just be the country who has the potential to elect a government that can go to the eurogroup and similar meetings and say 'stfu' more or less, with a lot of the other 'southern' nations siding with them because 'finally' a big player is talking in a more agreeable fashion -- something they wouldn't dare do until this point due to lack of support from the big players.

People were thinking the German elections will be important for the future of the eurozone? I disagree. They are competing on who will be the bigger asshole (at least from my perspective -- clearly the average german voter is convinced this is the best way forward which is fair enough and they have this right). Italian elections is where it's all at for the future of the eurozone right now.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"With all due respect, kind sir, and I *really* do not mean to offend the dutch people: It could be argued that if 'southern' countries could borrow so cheaply right now, they would also be fine by borrowing themselves out of debt through inflation (something 'southern countries' are not allowed to do).

I honestly don't wish this on you, but suppose your credit rating is cut and your borrowing costs immediately skyrocket, then what? This is more or less what happened in 'southern europe' -- hooked to cheap debt and suddenly it wasn't so cheap anymore and you *had* to borrow at higher rates to pay back the lower rate loans (due to deficits, which NL clearly has). It truly is a vicious cycle that happens very rapidly and you don't quite grasp how bad it is until it happens to you.

I think we need to find a good solution to the eurozone crisis because it would *really* be a shame for us to wait until a 'northern' country (probably will be Belgium or Netherlands first tbh) faces doom until we act. I honestly don't want to see you or any other dutch person suffer the same kind of crap that other countries have had to put up with, especially when your finance minister is the one who was proud of himself about the deposit levy in Cyprus.

I think overall you will find that the 'northern countries' are benefiting from this crisis so far for their own gains (do you think it's possible for Germany to get to 0% debt over the medium-term if people aren't *literally* paying them to take their money? if you were them would you want to 'fix' this 'unfortunate' benefit?)",0,1364697643,null,0,1364698737,0,c95is72,t3_1bb63x,t1_c95is72,t1_c95i7nz,null,1431724907,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

&gt;The euro suffers from a similar asymmetry. Debtor-euro countries are to cut wages and deficits, but creditor-euro countries aren't forced to increase wages and deficits. Perversely, the opposite. In other words, northern Europe isn't doing enough to offset the demand destruction in southern Europe. And it's sinking them all. Even worse, this slow-motion collapse is turning loans that would have otherwise been good into losses -- losses that force bailouts and faster collapses.

It's a balancing act, though.

&gt;Eurocrats seem content to do just enough to keep everything from falling apart, and nothing more. It's one part inflationphobia, and another part strategy. Indeed, it's how they try to keep the pressure on the southern bloc to push through unpopular labor market reforms. But doing enough today eventually won't be enough tomorrow if the southern bloc doesn't have any hope of recovering within the euro. The politics will turn against the common currency long before that.

EDIT: On a global scale, there's adjustment in the developing countries. E.g. in China the wages for workers have rocketed lately. This eases the downward pressure on wages elsewhere. Maybe the manufacturing sector in Europe can get some help there, though economists are prone to point out that in e.g. the US value of manufacturing has risen but with less people employed. So what sort of quality jobs are coming back is a question. Then there's value of the renminbi currency as China tends to recycle all the dollars and euros used to buy its exports by investing them in gov. debt in the west exacerbating global imbalances.",1,1364717398,null,0,1364720168,0,c95n8jg,t3_1bclsq,t1_c95n8jg,t3_1bclsq,null,1431722734,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Also, interesting as regional trait:

Reading through it, I actually partially agree on the weak points of the Euro that the author is pointing out. The data actually seems pretty OK, but looking more thoroughly at the contents most of the points turn into it's vague assumptions.

Take this very important point in the text where O'brien writes:
 
&gt;""Austerity has been a complete disaster. It's actually increased debt burdens across southern Europe, because it's reduced growth more than it's reduced borrowing costs""

He backs this up by referencing to [a Paul Krugman article](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/22/paul-de-grauwe-and-the-rehn-of-terror/) that involves just as flimsy postulates. Here's the top comment to Krugmans article, that pretty much shoots down Krugmans conclusion:

&gt;The problem with this analysis above is simple: correlation does not imply causation. Just because stronger austerity is linked to higher debt ratio does not in any way imply that austerity is the cause of this increase. The only way you can show this is by looking at each country over time, look at when austerity began, and analyse its effect on debt ratio.

&gt;Now, taking the case of Ireland, austerity began with the IMF bailout in late 2010 (so its effects can only truly be seen in full by 2011). However by that time the debt ratio had already ballooned from 25% in 2007 to nearly 100% by 2010. It can clearly be seen in this graph that debt ratio had ballooned *before* austerity began.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Irish_debt_and_EU_average.png

&gt;Ironically the introduction of austerity is linked to a slowing down of debt ratio increase:

&gt;2007-2008: +20%
&gt;2008-2009: +20%
&gt;2009-2010: +27%

&gt;2010-2011: +14%

&gt;While the post-austerity pattern is not the same everywhere, the pre-austerity pattern is virtually identical across the board: all bailed out EU countries had sharp and linearly increasing debt ratios long before austerity measures even were put forward.

&gt;So :
&gt;1. Concluding that austerity has caused an increase in debt ratio is a mistake.
&gt;2. The only logical conclusion one can draw from the above is that the pre-existing problem of high deficits and recession itself was linked to stronger austerity measures... a point which is rather trivially obvious.

Most of the readers today know, that you have to back your claims up with facts, and that goes for both side of the political spectrum.

This is a big problem in regards to the economic discussions of in this subreddit, since it is a very complex area that is impossible to reach an in depth understanding of - and where it is almost impossible to get down to the facts of the matter.

true,Haaveilla,Zespagne,Espagne,"* You can surprise them. Small packages such as enveloppes are put in the mailbox, bigger packages that don't fit in the mailbox will be delivered hand to hand, or if there is nobody at home, they will get a paper telling them to pick up the package at the nearest post office. We don't leave stuff at the door like you do in the States. It may only happen in a small village where the post office is far away, and if the mailman knows the people who live there and they have agreed on this beforehand. It is also common practice to ask for packages to be delivered hand to hand (no matter the size) with proof of delivery. We call this ""remise contre signature"" or ""envoi avec accusé de réception"". You should probably ask at your post office how to get such a service while sending from the States. But I think you should be able to surprise them.
  
* I have bought quite a lot of stuff from the US, baseball cards for example, and I never got torn packages so that's surprising. It could be regular damage or theft, but it's hard to say.

Stop being an arrogant dick. I'm personally aware of what socialism is, but Europe is also typically not considered socialist beyond a social-democratic streak that most would not even consider actual socialism. True or ""original"" socialism(worker/government control of the means of production) is almost entirely extinct.

I'm getting the sense you just don't want to commit to saying it is right to take 100% of what someone made.

&gt;The reason it's specifically yank logic is because your sentence reads exactly like the ""all poor Americans believe that they're just temporarily embarrassed millionaires"" joke/phrase, and that really shows up your cultural upbringing as a result, since Europeans know better/different.

That's not what I said at all. It's not rooted in the idea that someday everyone will be a millionaire, it's rooted in the idea that it's not *right* to take everything (or almost everything) that someone worked for....whether or not you will be in their ranks.

&gt; Now, taking the case of Ireland, austerity began with the IMF bailout in late 2010 (so its effects can only truly be seen in full by 2011). However by that time the debt ratio had already ballooned from 25% in 2007 to nearly 100% by 2010.

This is a rather specious point, because most of that debt increase is down to a single decision from the Irish government to adopt the obligations of the Anglo Irish Bank in full, even though the bank was bankrupt, and is going to be shut down. That is not the usual case.

Also, I take your point about the difficulty in laymen discussing economics, but I think there are valid discussions to be had. It's clear there are advantages which stack up against disadvantages, and the degree of importance of each is difficult to judge. But that doesn't mean you can't understand each as a concept, which is important. And that allows you to observe logical inconsistencies, for instance a lot of countries are proposing neoliberal policies abroad that they wouldn't consider acceptable at home. i.e. a politician might see that spending money at home is popular, spending money on 'lazy Greeks' less so, and so is a domestic Keynesian and a European austerity hawk.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Interesting post in the comments:

&gt; Actually, the correct comparison is to equate the euro to the gold exchange standard, not the gold standard. In a gold standard, countries peg the value of their currency to gold and the price of gold floats. This is problematic because there is a limited amount of gold and the amount mined can only be increased incrementally, so this acts as an impediment to growth (not enough money supply to conduct more transactions).

&gt; The gold exchange standard was a system established at Brettonwood during the waning days of WW2 and implemented at the end of the war and lasted until 1971 when Nixon took the US off of that system. In the gold exchange system, world currencies were pegged to the US dollar. Only the USD was pegged to gold (at a price of $35/oz). This made the USD the ""n-currency"". This worked when the US represented more than half of the world output at the end of the war, but eventually it became impossible for the US to maintain a fixed price for gold at $35/oz as the rest of the world recovered from the war and the US saw its productivity in comparison to other countries fall (we were still dominant and becoming more productive, but other countries were closing the gap).

&gt; Being the n-currency in a fixed exchange rate system can be wonderfully profitable to an economy...for a while. Then, it turns ugly. As the n-currency, all the other currencies have to peg to your currency by adjusting their interest rates and money supply. This is awesome for your n-currency economy because it allows you to overstimulate your economy through fiscal stimulus without having to choose between higher interest rates or higher inflation as an affter effect. Why? Because your inflation automatically gets exported to the other currencies in your fixed exchange rate system and you get to keep your interest rate unchanged. In other words, you don't change a thing -- everyone else has to adjust to you! You could be nice to them and just adjust their price levels so that you keep your inflation in check and in your own country, but that means slowing down growth and what elected politician wants to do that?!?!

&gt; Eventually, other countries get tired of importing your inflation because it forces them to either deflate their price level (i.e., lower wages), keep interest rates high and very often cut fiscal spending (to afford high interest rates on govt borrowing). They eventually collapse from continually deflating their economies to absorb your inflation. Then, either you bail them out with a constant flow of transfer payments, or somebody has to break up the fixed exchange rate system. This is where things are now for Germany and the eurozone.

&gt; How did all this happen?

&gt; In the late 90's before the euro, Germany's economy had a 10% unemployment rate, powerful unions, etc., and these were pointed to as examples of European socialism run amok. However, the biggest fear for the expected eurozone was inflation and Germany didn't just have incredibly low inflation, but it also had an iron and constitution that required it to avoid anything more than 2% inflation (because of its experience with hyperinflation in the interwar years). In fact, Germany had forced deflation though its economy earlier in the decade as a means defray the costs of reunification and prevent the inflation that would've normally accompanied the massive government spending that the reunification had required. As a result, the DM was the strongest EU currency and was essential for a currency union. Germany was so afraid of giving up the DM and control of its monetary policy that it only agreed to join by making a deal that basically allows Germany's central bank to dominate and override the European Central Bank. This is how Germany eventually became the de facto n-currency of the eurozone.

&gt; It has been remarkably profitable for Germany because it is now effectively operating with a currency that is undervalued for the strength of its economy (and is overvalued for its weaker, less productive neighbors). This has led to Germany (a country of 82M) having the largest trade surplus of any country in the world - yes, even larger than China and its 1.344 billion people. While the current bailouts are costly, they are still way cheaper than all of the benefits that the euro brings Germany, not to mention how incredibly costly a breakup of the euro would cost. Thus, Germany will continue to try to be the n-currency of the euro for as long as it can force its neighbors to swallow its unfair monetary and trade advantage, or, until German or other voters finally say, ""Enough!"".",0,1364724659,null,0,false,0,c95o0yj,t3_1bclsq,t1_c95o0yj,t3_1bclsq,null,1431722363,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Ok seriamente.

Anzitutto hai riportato un frammento dell'articolo decontestualizzato: la tua citazione 

&gt;""competenza nella lettura e scrittura sufficienti per affrontare testi complessi""

Non è riferita al reale obiettivo di una associazione politica, ma alla ridefinizione della funzione obiettivo nel computo statistico del numero di alfabetizzati. Molto intelligente secondo me.
Ma, no, decisamente non l'intento del dopolavoro del PCI o del MSI.

Accetto la tua ironia sul mio essere stato indottrinato e mi stupisce come ti siano bastate poche righe per etichettarmi, ma chi mi indottrinó?
Bada, io la realtà descritta dall'articolo la conosco bene perché l'ho vissuta da bambino. A sei anni il mio nonno materno mi portava al dopolavoro del partito comunista perché ""chist guaglione s'adda impararà"" e il mio nonno paterno al circolo del movimento sociale dietro al baretto perché ""nun putimm crescere nu figlio solo comunista"". Per me il mistero più grande era come si fossero mai potute unire le famiglie, sembrava una commedia di De Filippo a Natale e a Pasqua. Poi qualche anno più tardi ho capito che dopo la lettura del manifesto e la trincatina tricolore, i miei nonni si sono sempre incontrati e rispettati sull'unico campo che aveva un significato pratico per loro: quello di grano.

Io sono stato indottrinato da tutte e due le correnti, che te lo dico a fare? Quando all'Accademia mi hanno detto che per legge il militare deve essere apolitico quasi baciavo in fronte il colonnello, figurati. 
Ci hanno provato anche là a indottrinarmi, per carità. Poveracci, che ne sapevano loro di un campo di grano e del partito della zappa.

Per ribadire il punto, ho deviato anche troppo, io non credo che l'articolo da te citato sia completamente genuino nella sua analisi. Continuo a credere che, e bada bene *nella seconda parte*, quando parla del ruolo di partiti e associazione politiche nell'alfabetizzare le masse ignoranti, non accennando al concreto rischio di indottrinamento, si svaluti tantissimo nella credibilità. Un peccato in quanto lo ritengo, come già detto, un bell'articolo di un autore intelligente.

P.S. c'è una sola risposta all'analfabetismo, ed è nelle aule di scuola. Tra gli odiati promessi sposi e l'ermetismo di Ungaretti.

&gt;I'm getting the sense you just don't want to commit to saying it is right to take 100% of what someone made.

Good thing nobody said those things then. I don't think I'm ever going to be able to explain to you how a person can only be rich if the society allows it, it can only happen in a world where they are safe, where workers are paid low amounts, where property/stock can be bought and sold, where there is no threat of an army showing up at your door, where his money has value.

That's why when the country is in crisis most Europeans believe that **those with the broadest shoulders should bear the heaviest burden**, because taking away from the poor to give to the rich on the basis that the rich are ""better"" is ridiculous and something that Europeans are generally smarter than their American counterparts over.

On a related note, Europe has rescued Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain. On all of those countries Europe has imposed very strict rules about spending, very strict cuts to spending (never on defense, funnily, always on health and education), very painful tax raises and looser rules for enterprises to fire people as they see fit, while at the same time cutting off the protection for the unemployed. In exactly **NONE** of those countries have the measures taken produced the effects promised: return to confidence, slowly rise of employment, rises on inversions, etc etc. The only effects felt on those countries have been a deeper inmersion into recession.

Therefore, the aforementioned schoolchildren pass out, simply because their parents have gotten past the point where they can sustain a regular meal for their children, back at home.

I

&gt; Due to Heidelberg’s emotive beauty, General Patton fell in love with the city and refused to see it bombed, hence the city survived WWII and became the headquarters for United States’ forces in Europe following the war. Ironically Patton was highly criticised for his lenient policy towards the enemy and was fatally injured in a traffic accident in Heidelberg just after the war ended. ([Source](http://www.inyourpocket.com/germany/frankfurt/heidelberg_55532f))

II

&gt; Some historians suggested Heidelberg escaped bombing in WWII because the U.S. Army wanted to use the city as a garrison after the war. As Heidelberg was neither an industrial center nor a transport hub, it did not present a target of opportunity. Other notable university towns, such as Tübingen and Göttingen, were spared bombing as well. Allied air raids focused extensively on the nearby industrial cities of Mannheim and Ludwigshafen.

&gt; The U.S. Army may have chosen Heidelberg as a garrison base due to its excellent infrastructure, including the Heidelberg-Mannheim Autobahn (freeway), which connected to the Mannheim-Darmstadt-Frankfurt Autobahn, and the U.S. Army installations in Mannheim and Frankfurt. The intact railroad infrastructure was more important in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when most heavy loads were still carried by train, not by truck. Heidelberg had the untouched ""Grossdeutschland Kaserne"" Wehrmacht installation. The US Army used it as the Campbell Barracks soon after.

It is strange that free school lunch is regarded as luxury, maybe that is part of the problem. When you start from the idea that something will cost a lot then it will. In Finland the state legislated the law regarding free school lunches in the middle of the second world war and at that time this country was poor and mainly agrarian society.

&gt; When in a state of extreme austerity that has practically destroyed public healthcare, dramatically lowered quality of life (I am talking about significant decrease of life expectancy), that's more of a fantasy.

Maybe so, but you have to make creative steps that have positive system wide effects. For example when Finland in the beginning of 90s had its own banking and economic crisis, the state made such creative things as making large increase to student benefits - the idea was that by increasing student benefits, more young people would opt to study than to be unemployed, this was better for the state because unemployment benefits were higher than student benefits, thus the state could decrease its expenditure while it created future opportunities for young people... The same kind of idea was behind entrepreneur benefits or start-up money, the state noted that it could decrease benefits spending if it paid people the basic amount of benefits for the first 6 months of starting your own business: while many would fail and become unemployed again, some would succeed and some would even hire new people, and thus state would decrease its spending.

Of course every situation is different, but in every situation almost in every time creating thinking helps. And again, it helps you if you take a system wide view on these things.

Bagnai non è il solo a pensarla così.Persone di spicco parlano di cose simili,ed è facile vedere che l'argomento sta prendendo piede. basti pensare cosa aspetta l'italia nei prossimi anni grazie alle politiche di austerità dettate dall'unione europea per capire che l'argomento Europa sarà il tema scottante dell'economia italiana e non solo.Se ci fossero gli stati uniti d'europa che condividono il debito,nessuno penserebbe a uscire dall'euro.Ma così non è,e ci prospettano un futuro senza speranze.
Dare la colpa della crisi ai problemi italiani che hai citato tu nel post precedente comunque mi sembra piuttosto sbagliato.
Non sono cose belle ed influenzano negativamente l'economia certamente ma ce ne passa a dire che sono la causa della crisi.

a) Life savings of old people

b) Businesses (a majority of which are legit)

c) certain pension funds

d) The workers, who just got paid half of their wages in cash and are told they should get the rest soon, if they weren't fired instead. (mostly a direct result of *b*)

The leaked information of politicians benefiting from debt writeoffs (leaked by concerned Cypriots) gives us an idea that a few low to mid-level politicians were involved in getting 'free money' from the banks, although the amounts were not big enough to put a dent into them in any huge way (but will probably [and should] be punished).

Colpa mia, per caritá, é un mio limite!Di mestiere non faccio la divulgatrice scientifica e ho questo limite purtroppo!

Magari posso chiarire meglio il mio punto di vista. Certo che Bagnai non é il solo,ma la frangia che la pensa come lui rimane in minoranza. Io, te e tutti gli altri che economisti non sono, abbiamo un grande aiuto dalla nostra parte: il metodo scientifico e il sistema creato attorno ad esso. Siccome non possiamo essere tutti esperti di tutto, possiamo e dobbiamo fidarci della cosiddetta peer review. Quando una teoria nuova esce, viene esaminata dagli esperti del settore ovunque nel mondo, che la testano e ne saggiano la bontá. Generalmente una teoria viene insegnata quando é accettata in maniera abbastanza ampia, perché vari esperti del settore ne hanno verificato l'attendibilitá e soliditá.

Ma immaginiamo che uno non abbia le basi che io, dato che non sono in grado di trasmetterle in un post. E' lí che ci viene in soccorso il sistema scientifico. Quando una teoria é minoritaria le cose sono due: o e nuova, o non é stata considerata affidabile da molti. Siccome questa teoria non é nuova per niente (é in giro dagli anni '80), io e te, da osservatori esterni non esperti, possiamo dedurre che una grossa fetta di esperti del settore non l'abbia ritenuta abbastanza affidabile. 

Io e te, immagino, non siamo biologi. Eppure presumo che fra creazionismo e teoria dell'evoluzione,la seconda ci convinca di piú, in base alle nostre limitate conoscenze. Eppure non é scritta nella pietra. Come mai ""ci fidiamo""?Perché,considerato il modo in cui é appoggiata dalla comunitá scientifica, e sula base della spegazione fornitaci, la riteniamo logica e attendibile.

La teoria darwiniana é peró insegnata nelle scuole. Nessuno nelle scuole discute e spiega la bontá o meno del progetto europeo. O il sistema economico e politico dell'Italia.

Weed was once on the way to be decriminalized, we had lot's of shops and fields out in the open in the 90s even doh it was still illegal, but when the governmnet changed it's mind that ended rather quickly. But smoking and possession of small amounts doesn't get you in serious trouble, maybe a small fine, or nothing at all, depending on the region (some police officials are quoted as saying ""we got better things to do"")

Don't know much about other weaker drugs (ecstasy/amphetamines/etc), but I doubt it's a lot harsher than weed.

Over and above you face criminal penalties. CZ also has treatment programs including methadone clinics. 

Personally I'd like to see all drugs legalized, sales of other drugs (marijuana, mushrooms, lsd etc.) restricted to adults and hard drugs (meth, heroin) not sold but given for free to addicts in the hopes of getting them into a treatment program while reducing crime involved in order to get money to purchase those drugs.

Sono daccordo con quanto affermi che sia difficile per gente non professionalmente esperta farsi idee chiare su concetti che richiedono una appropriata conoscenza scientifica.
Però mi sembra che sei rimasta spiazzata dal video ;)
nel senso che la tua risposta è stata : affidiamoci alla comunità scientifica.
mentre prima sostenevi ""l'uscita dall'euro è una cazzata!""

c'è una bella differenza.Anche io come te qualche mese fa avrei detto la stessa cosa,sia chiaro!
Però personalmente ritengo che il problema non si possa risolvere con un DOGMA ""uscire dall'euro è il male del mondo"".

Qui bisogna informarsi.La cosa che spinge,ME,non esperto di economia a informarmi,nei miei limiti,è proprio la mancanza di un dibattito serio sul tema.
Sui giornali,tv,nessuno ne parla.La politica italiana,con il governo monti,si è irrigidita su una politica europea,sotto pressione di altri stati.Qui la cosa comincia a puzzare anche a un cittadino ""normale"".
Mancanza di informazione totale,distorsione della realtà è il pane quotidiano dell'informazione di massa in italia(e penso anche all'estero,su certi temi).

Quei pochi economisti che si sono espressi contro l'euro l'hanno fatto assumendosi la responsabilità di farlo.E guarda caso a me sembrano che riescano a confutare tutte le obiezioni.
Allora perchè nessuno ne parla decentemente?
Il fatto è che qui in italia,e non solo,c'è un enorme,enorme pressione politica.E suppongo interessi in gioco.

Quello che io vorrei,sarebbe più informazione su un tema tanto importante,che a quanto pare non è un dogma.Ma nessuno ne vuole parlare.Anzi vengono bollati come pazzi.

Però ultimamente anche nella politica,quelli che fino a ieri giuravano sull'euro,si stanno riempiendo di dubbi.
Ed è sotto gli occhi di tutti.Partiti euroscettici si stanno formando in tutta europa.

Io non so se l'euro sia stato un errore in origine,probabilmente no.
La gestione che si sta facendo ORA è un errore.
L'euro sta diventando un arma politica.E un arma politica è facile capire che è come un arma vera.
Anche il cittadino più stupido ha visto che l'europa ci impone cose folli,che inevitabilmente ci condurranno alla rovina.
E questo si che non serve una laurea in economia per capirlo.

Getting cigarettes is just a matter of buying them at the machines. Most of them now are key-controlled, so you'll have to get the permission from the owner. I've not seen anyone being rejected, even if they looked positively young. I have bought cigarettes myself for my mother when I was really young, at the local quiosk. No questions asked.

Smoking everywhere was pretty much the norm until roughly a decade ago, now restaurants can choose and most closed spaces are non-smoking, so there was a rather quick shift in behaviour there (most people have already assimilated that they go outside to smoke as a rule).

Drug dealers make most of their money off of addicts. Take away the lions share of their customers (by competing with a price that can't be beat) and they will have to look elsewhere to make a living. 

If an addict can get their fix for free, that means they don't need to commit further crime in order to fund their habit. Any crime that would have been committed to get the funds for their habit would be decreased/eliminated. $10 worth of heroin requires more than $10 worth of crime to be committed. Let's say someone smashes a car window to get that $10. Cost to replace the window? Greater than $10. Lost productivity of that worker who needs to replace the window? Greater than $10. Cost of reporting the crime to insurance company, and police? Greater than $10. Cost of police officer arresting the addict, jailing the addict, sending the addict to court, then possibly prison? A helluva lot greater than $10. Cost to society when that addict uses a dirty needle and contracts HIV or other communicable diseases? A buttload more than $10. Give the user the $10 worth of drugs (which is an inflated street price, the actual value of the drugs is much less than $10) and with that a clean needle, as well as a nurse or doctor who is there to offer treatment to get off of drugs? More than $10, but probably less than the cost of treating an addiction via the criminal system rather than under a medical system.

Here is what I said ""*""We helped"" isn't a bottomless license to take whatever you want.

When I asked you to actually say it outright, you dodged because you'd rightly get hammered to the proverbial wall if you said that. But the implication was pretty damn clear.

&gt;That's why when the country is in crisis most Europeans believe that those with the broadest shoulders should bear the heaviest burden, 

Except in *all* concerned countries, this is the case. They pay more than anyone else, even in the US. Most of our total income tax revenue comes from the rich here.


&gt;because taking away from the poor to give to the rich on the basis that the rich are ""better"" is ridiculous and something that Europeans are generally smarter than their American counterparts over.

You are seriously an idiot if you think that's how Americans think. I have never met someone who would agree with that statement as a whole(taking from the poor for the rich especially), and few who would agree with even parts of it.

&gt;I don't think I'm ever going to be able to explain to you how a person can only be rich if the society allows it, it can only happen in a world where they are safe, where workers are paid low amounts, where property/stock can be bought and sold, where there is no threat of an army showing up at your door, where his money has value.

No shit sherlock. No one is arguing against that.

&gt;But like I said, you believe that because a millionaire gave up his family (although I've never met a single millionaire that wasn't a playboy so I'm not sure where you got that from) that he should be exempt from tax. 

1) I doubt you know many of them.

2) No one is saying they should exempt from tax, just that ""well he needed society!"" has it's limits on what that person should have to give to society. It has *limits*, not ""it means they should pay no tax""*

true,Groft_VanMoor,null,null,"Ok, non è una situazione semplice. Da quanto ho capito siete in due unità abitative diverse, quindi non siete in condominio.

* La Cassazione dice ""*Abbaiare fa parte della natura del cane e non può essergli del tutto impedito, perciò episodi saltuari di disturbo da parte del nostro animale domestico possono e devono essere tollerati dai vicini in nome dei principi del vivere civile* (cfr. citata Cassazione del 2008)"". Quindi in pratica non puoi pretendere l'abbattimento/rimozione del cane, perché ledi un diritto dei tuoi vicini.


* Ciò detto, è vero che dalla sentenza della Sezione Prima penale, della Cassazione del 2004, n. 36241, si evince che: “*Non ha importanza se a lamentarsi per i latrati dei cani e’ un solo vicino. A fare scattare la responsabilita’ del proprietario dell’animale, infatti, non e’ ”l’effettivo raggiungimento di plurime persone”, ma la ”potenzialita’ diffusiva” dell’abbaiare dell’animale, che deve essere oggettivamente idonea a disturbare le occupazioni o il riposo*”.

* In un’ altra sentenza della Cassazione, n. 715 del 14 gennaio 2011, I sez. Penale, si puntualizza quanto segue: “La responsabilità dei proprietari di cani che, abbaiando, disturbano il riposo notturno del vicinato sono suscettibili di contravvenzione per disturbo della quiete pubblica”. Il reato in questione è quello di cui all’art. 659 cod. pen. (Disturbo delle occupazioni e del riposo delle persone), che dice come per avere reato *è sufficiente la volontarietà della condotta desunta dalle obbiettive circostanze di fatto*.
E' però essenziale *l’idoneità del fatto ad arrecare disturbo ad un numero indeterminato di persone e non già l’effettivo disturbo alle stesse* (Cass., Sez. 1^, 13/12/2007, n. 246)

Quindi il cane deve avere sufficiente ""potenzialità diffusiva"" per essere **oggettivamente** idoneo a disturbare **un numero indeterminato** di persone. In quel caso, può rientrare nel caso di ""disturbo delle occupazioni e del riposo delle persone"", per il quale è prevista una pena pecuniaria (soldi per il mancato riposo) e in casi estremi il carcere. In caso di mancanza oggettiva o di impossibilità di raggiungere un numero indeterminato di individui, la faccenda si complica (è il caso dei condomini, ma dubito sia il tuo caso).

Ora sono di fretta, ma prova a guardare anche il reato di ""maltrattamento di animali"", è stato incrementato a reato penale (carcere) da qualche anno. Però non conosco gli estremi, so solo che è necessario un sopralluogo da parte della ASL/organi competenti.

**Alcohol**. Expensive. Beer from ~1€ per 0,33l can/bottle. Wine from 6€ per 0,75l bottle, liquor from 10€ 0,5l bottle. Anything over 4,7% is sold only in government monopoly, Alko, stores. Milder ones can be sold at pretty much any store or kiosk.

Age limit is 18 for up to 22% alcohol, above that it's 20, but can be sold in bars, pubs and the such for 18-year-olds. Drunk driving limit is 0,05%, 0,12% aggravated.

During the period of the Ancien Régime, starting in the early 17th century, the royal standard of France became a plain white flag as a symbol of purity, sometimes covered in fleur-de-lis when in the presence of the king or bearing the ensigns of the Order of the Holy Spirit.

The white color was also used as a symbol of military command, by the commanding officer of a French army. It would be featured on a white scarf attached to the regimental flag as to recognise French units from foreign ones and avoid friendly fire incidents. The French troops fighting in the American War of Independence fought under the white flag.

The French Navy used a plain white ensign for ships of the line. Smaller ships might have used other standards, such as a fleur-de-lys on white field. Commerce and private ships were authorised to use their own designs to represent France, but were forbidden to fly the white ensign.""

I'm not arguing that greeks are lazy or what not. Politicians were using euro as a way to get cheap international loans and use populist slogans to get elected (bigger pensions! etc.). I just hope Greece stops blaiming everyone else, but itself.

During WWII greeks were awesome. I've read somwhere that even Nazis respected greeks as equals (only ones that were thought about in that manner as I recall). To be fair Eastern Europe did not surrender - Poland caused more german casualties than France. Lithuania fell to the russians first (our president made a major fuck up at that point). So no one is argueing about how tough you are. Yet, this generation needs to man up and work instead of blaming EU/IMF/Banks. Nothing is going to change, IMF and EU bailed Greece out nad thats it. Work for it (British repayed their loans from WWII to americans only in 2008). 

I'm sorry for greek people that are frustrated. I can relate to that. I live in a poor country (compared to everyone else in EU). People are not stupid here, they just choose to work instead. Riot costs money and repels investors, so every riot greeks have makes situation worse. Yet again, I feel for them.

Leaving EU would devastate Greece. But if they want to - why not. To be fair, Greece contributes less than 2% of EU's GDP so financially it wouldn't be a disaster for anyone else.

The state of North Rhine-Westphalia has a so called ""small amount"" of 10 grams (afaik) which means that if you are caught with less than 10g, it'll be confiscated. You'll be very likely charged with possession and it's up to the attorney to decide whether or not the case is dismissed. AFAIK this happens in most cases in more liberal states, such as NRW or Berlin. In more conservative states such as for example Bavaria however, it very well may not.

However, there is an even more shocking and ridiculous option to get fucked. Imagine you're doing a weekend trip to Amsterdam from somewhere in NRW by car. You go there, you and your friends have a great time, smoke a few joints on friday and of course take a few grams home as a souvenir. Now as soon as you cross the border on sunday, customs and/or the police, spot an older car with three or four younger people on the Autobahn. A classic suspect. They pull you over, search your car and very likely find your weed.

Smoking is pretty much universally accepted. There's been some recent legislation to try to prohibit it in bars and public places, but again, most establishments skirt the law and allow it anyway. 

Heavy taxes have been levied on ready-made cigs lately, in an attempt to raise prices to the EU averages, which has prompted a large portion of the population to buy cut tobacco and roll their own, which is much cheaper. 

Beer is consumed as freely as coca-cola, and is actually cheaper, most of the time. Most households distill their own strong drinks (rakia, predominantly) and wine.

Users: everyone. Heavy drinking is limited to youth and students.

**Tobacco**: Shit's getting pricier and pricier: about 6 euro for a regular pack now. You are not allowed to smoke in bars, but it depends where you go. You might can in some smaller ones. Age 16.

Users: The youth is smoking less and less but still have some. Lower educated people smoke more. Students smoke a lot (but that might be the crowd I'm hanging with). Old people smoke.

**Cannabis**:Some people smoke cannabis, about the same percentage as other western European countries. Not a lot of people smoke regularly but almost everybody at least tried it.

Users: Mostly high school kids, the ""alternative"" crowd, the ""hip hop"" crowd and foreigners. Coffeeshops are filled with all kinds of people though, but these are the regular customers.

**Psilocybin mushrooms/truffles**: Sold in smart/headshops, the shops that sell bongs and other drug equipment. I don't know a lot of people that use this.

Users: People experimenting. Very limited crowd.

**Party drugs (MDMA/Ecstacy/GHB/Amphetamines/Ketamine and in some way cocaine)**: Illegal, production is punishable. Though the government is surprisingly flexible with these. If you are found with a bit of this on the street or on a party, you will usually be warned. Big amounts meant for dealing won't. 

We are the Ecstasy capital of the world, most of the pills and powder comes from the Netherlands. This makes the stuff very cheap and we have excellent education on the subject. If you want to test the stuff you've bought because it looks fishy you can send it to your local health office and they will analyze the contents and give it back to you. GHB is gaining in popularity because it can be made with equipment at home but the usage isn't as widespread as the other drugs.

Users: 18-30 year old hip people, old ravers and druggy people. Almost exclusively used at raves/parties.

**Hard Drugs**: Illegal, usage is pretty low and stable. I don't think I've ever seen junks on the street but they used to in every city back in the day. Nobody uses heroin except for the old junkies. The state hands them portions of heroin so they wont have to steal to sustain their habit. Cocaine is usually used as a party drug but the government does not fuck around with this one. 

Users: Junkies

(It baffles me how many Americans seem to be okay with smoking marijuana and driving afterwards. That is completely irresponsible to me.) However, the so called MPU system is based on assessing your ability to drive a car safely and responsibly. You are much more likely to regain your license after proving you are able to stay sober for longer periods of time than if your therapist or whoever realizes you still get hammered every night, for instance.

The thing is: the fact that you are in possession of a few grams of cannabis is, according to their logic, proof enough that you are both mentally and from your personal traits point of view (it's late, I can't think of a better wording) unable to drive a vehicle. Which is completely bullshit to me. Just because someone occasionally smokes a joint on weekends doesn't mean hes not capable of driving to work on Monday morning.
