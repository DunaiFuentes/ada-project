Early Sunday morning, around midnight, a fatal Car accident occurred on the B26 near Trunstadt. The driver of the BMW lost control over his vehicle in a slight right turn, sliding approximately 250 meters across the street until he hit a tree. 

The Car immediately caught fire and unfortunately the trapped driver was unable to exit the vehicle in time. A first responder tried rescue the driver out of the burning vehicle, but failed. The 43 year old first responder from Eltmann (County of Hassberge) was taken to the Hospital in Bamberg to treat his burns on both hands. 

The Fire Department initially assumed another person to be in the vehicle, which later turned out to be not true. 

The wrecked car had a license plate from Bamberg, according to the Bamberg Police. On the orders of the prosecution an expert was tasked with the investigation of the accident. 

The identity of the driver is unknown at this point. The Fire Departments of Viereth, Trunstadt, Oberhaid and Trosdorf responded and were at the scene of the accident. ",0,1385008317,null,0,false,0,cdjer0h,t3_1r4148,t1_cdjer0h,t3_1r4148,null,1428571856,7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,7

Typically, Haupt- or Realschule would be followed by three years of vocational school combined with job training within a company, or a two year school to earn the necessary degree for university access, usually already specialized (e.g., it could have a focus on chemistry).

Most of my german knowledge comes from taking Integration-Courses.  What surprised me the most was probably the vast array of dialects and differences in the language these is within a short geographical change.  Let me explain.  
I started living in a small city in Bavaria. In bavaria most people speak Bavarian german which is nothing like the german someone would learn in school or language classes i.e, Standard german or Hochdeutsch. This is where it gets complicated for me.  Although I was living in Bavaria I was living in a certain geographical section of bavaria called Schwaben or Swabia. Here they speak Swabian dialect which has different words and slight grammar differences.  But since I was still in Bavaria the swabian dialect wasn't so strong.  Then comes the fun!  My partners family comes from the Heartland of Swabia.  Schwabisch Alb direkt im Ländle.  Every word of german I though I knew does not apply when I am visiting the family.  I can still get around pretty well in every day life dealing with dialects here.  I more so have a problem while speaking with the Older Generations.  Most of these people have never learned standard german and have really heavy dialect-pronunciation and use words that are obsolete in standard german.

true,Cleopatra_,null,null,"1. **The People, obviously** // Oh, Germans are my favourite people. I always read that friendships are harder to make, but worth it, and oh how worth it they are. Germans are the kindest type of people I've met. They are incredibly honest and practical. A German will just ask for a favour, no buttering up, and just respond to a favour being asked without making you feel better for asking. They'll tell you if it's a mission but they'll do it anyway. No small talk with cashiers. People are surprised when I greet them in the street. The last thing Germans are is fake.

2. **Sex and violence** // Germans are very open sexually. The Playboy, Hustler, etc magazines sit right next to the chocolates. People skim through them without being embarrassed. There are huge sex shops; in South Africa our biggest sex shops are online. Violence, on the other hand, is censored and restricted.

3. **Food** // Besides pork, meat is incredibly expensive compared to SA. I couldn't believe the price of frozen fish. Beef and lamb are of lower quality. Most other groceries are much cheaper. Only vegetables in season are sold, and there is no option for pre-cut veg unless it is frozen. 

4. **Crime** // We once saw a porsche parked outside a Bäckerei, keys in, still running.

5. **Work** // In an engineering office, people actually work and earn their money.

6. **Housing** // There is about three types of looks for houses, without much creative expression. I've yet to be in a house that isn't full of Ikea. When my friend moved villages, they gave her a case of beer to welcome her.

7. **Public Transport and Postal System** // We don't have any form of reliable or safe public transport in SA so I have nothing to compare it to, but the DB is beautiful. It just works. It is CLEAN. The DP is just as fantastic, and so cheap.

8. **Honesty System and Following Rules** // I have been sent a customs bill after the package arrived. I still haven't received my doctor's bill from September. Since I live in a small town, the doctor's office had never had a patient without a medical card. After all the confusion, I wrote down my name and address on a post it note for them to send the bill to. Even the prisoners at my town's prison are allowed to go outside. We joke that they'd never be able to escape cause they'd get to the first set traffic lights and have to wait for the green man.

9. **Efficiency** // Car fines are handled with such efficiency. They arrive within the next few days, you are expected to pay almost immediately. Things work. Things are how they should be. Germans are also very pedantic about facts. ""We went at 14.30"" ""No we didn't ! It was 14.25"" type of thing happens in every conversation. It's been fun to encourage it too, sometimes I say something happened at 14.30, even though I KNOW it happened at 14.29. Germans love things to be true, and they LOVE being truer than their partner.

I'm not really sure if the fault lies with the school for choosing a shitty device, or with HP for delivering such a shitty product. I mean, come on - tablets failing to switch on, looping during automatic system checks, wifi connectivity problems? How is it possible that the devices are on the market with so many problems?

I do think that this is the way forward though. Kids are using technology at an earlier and earlier stage, and the jump to personalized tablets is inevitable. E-textbooks can be acquired for a fraction of the price of printed ones, saving money, and can updated editions can be downloaded basically on a yearly basis, rather than forcing kids to learn obsolete or outdated material. You hear as many cases of underfunded schools using textbooks from the 90s as you do schools paying hundreds of euros for the latest editions of a textbook, only to see that a chapter was added, and everything else left unchanged.

For the transition to be credible and wide-spread, companies need to develop a specialized tablet, specifically designed with students' needs in mind. Features could include:

* limited internet access (not to censor the kids or anything, but to prevent them from going on facebook and reddit in class, but allowing them to conduct research and stuff)

* specialized programmes and functionalities students need like highlighting text, note-taking, citation guides, etc... 

* access to journal databases like Jstor and EBSCO, etc...

Da giovane avevo accettato di lavorare al Banco di Sardegna, favorito dal fatto che mio padre ci lavorava da una vita, con contratto a termine poi rinnovato per 6 anni. Anni orrendi perché a) non so se quel lavoro possa piacere a qualcuno, ma a me non piaceva sicuro, e b) comunque il pesante pedaggio in termini di tempo ed energie ne ha fatto, per molti versi, degli anni sprecati.

Passano un po' di anni ed io mi ritrovo figlio di un dipendente non importante in pensione, ed anzi subito morto, senza crediti da riscuotere. Il BdS era il feudo della DC isolana e di Cossiga in particolare, e senza baciare culi di politici non si batteva chiodo. 
Faccio 2 concorsi interni per l'assunzione del personale precario, con il punteggio - nello scritto - più alto su, mi pare, circa 800 candidati. All'orale, a porte chiuse, mi fanno 2 domandine (""la differenza tra l'assegno di C/C e l'assegno circolare"", la mia risposta: ""la differenza tra questi due tipi di assegno è assimilabile a quella tra la cambiale tratta ed il vaglia cambiario o pagherò, in quanto bla bla bla..."") e fanno figurare un punteggio ridicolo che mi sbatte in fondo alla graduatoria. Scandalo tra i dipendenti ed i sindacati, ma si sa, tutti tengono famiglia...

Quindi, mi ritrovo disoccupato, senza autonomia, e riesco solo a tornare in Costa Smeralda - a 200 km da casa mia - a fare l'istruttore di palestra: quello che facevo per piacere fino ai 25 anni, perché sono un vecchio karateka ed insegnante di Yoga, ma questa volta, 10 anni dopo, con umiliazione, in un mondo (fitness :( ) che concepisce il lavoro sul corpo in maniera giovanilistica, superficiale, commerciale, che minimamente mi interessa, ed a contatto con un ambiente, quello dei VIP, di persone che non concepiscono di essere poco interessanti nonostante potere e denaro...

true,longestline,null,null,"Thank you for the interesting and detailed post! As a German, I can confirm that. People can often tell that you come from a town like 15 miles away, only because you use some different words or pronounciations. There are so many slight differences in the language that evolve to a totally different dialect over greater distances.. I grew up in a village in the Rhineland with parents from different parts of Germany that spoke something like 98% Hochdeutsch and I needed to become 10-12 years old until I began to understand the farmer down the street. Embarassing!  
I do understand the local dialect very well, but I could not even try to pretend that I can speak it, even after growing up and living there for almost 20 years. I would make a fool out of myself talking to the 'locals' in their dialect. I am serious. It is so dependent on what and if your family speaks a dialect since at school, they teach you Hochdeutsch only. In Bavaria, people are more self-conscious and more self-confident about their traditions and encourage growing up more traditionally and proud of the Bavarian dialect. Weird to see my son growing up with words and pronounciation that I don't use :)  
I could not understand my Grandma talking on the phone to one of her friends in a far-north German dialect (Plattdeutsch). Now that I have lived in different regions of Germany (settled in Bavaria a couple of years ago), I can say that I felt a little bit like a stranger all my life since whereever I moved, I could never blend in with the people on the street.  
The reason for these many and different dialects in such a small space compared to the scale of the US is, among others, that people did not move to different places up to the very modern days. You grew up in a region and you would build your own house on your parents lawn and get a wife from within a 5 mile radius. My father told me that it was a big deal for the family to go on vacation somewhat 30 miles away (in the 50s) which wasn't necessarily a matter of money. These were much more super-conservative times where you just ""weren't supposed to do that"". To this day some people in my village will say that so-and-so is ""not from here"" but from 10 miles away. Of course this has also to do with the level of education in the old days. Going to university in the generation of my parents (born end-30s/early 40s) was something special. My dad told me that in the early sixties, only 2 to 3 highschool students from his class of 40 would even try to go to university.

Quando ho lavorato per un grande studio di cui non faccio il nome siamo stati in crunch per 5 mesi, negli ultimi due prima della submission a MS e Sony non era strano fare giornate lavorative da 15 ore, alcune volte invece capitava di entrare nello studio alle 8.30, trovare uno Walkthrough breaker per caso mentre si masterizzava la versione da mandare in submission, uscire dallo studio alle 5 di mattina per poi rientrare alle 10 e fare altre e 12 ore a lavoro.

Era stancante ma lavoravo con un gruppo molto affiatato, facendo parte del team multiplayer i nostri test erano molto meno monotoni e c'era sempre la possibilità di divertirsi, i miei compagni di reparto hanno subito imparato i vari vaffanculo, porca puttana e porco cazzo, perchè un terzo delle volte i nostri test erano delle partite a tutti gli effetti.

Poi spesso si faceva pausa sigaretta tutti insieme, e se c'era il sole avevamo anche una palla da football amerregano, e qualche passaggio e lancio lungo usciva sempre.

Il giovedi avevamo pausa pranzo di 2 ore, e lo studio ci incoraggiava a fare esercizio fisico, quindi nel mio caso mi dividevo tra i pallonari e i baskettari, e credimi una partita a pallone o a basket, sopratutto per uno competitivo come me è un antistress da paura.

Nella mia ultima esperienza invece lavoravo probabilmente molto meno ore, ma gestivo 8-9 progetti esterni diversi nello stesso giorno, in più facevo da assistente personale al boss/fondatore dello studio, e in piùù dovevo fare da tester per i 2-3 progetti sviluppati internamente.

Idealmente uno studio dovrebbe fare crunch solo quando è indietro rispetto alla tabella di marcia, si fa qualche settimana di straordinario e si ritorna in linea con le aspettative.

La realtà è ben diversa, spesso i manager e i producer sbagliano (volontariamente) a stabilire una tabella di marcia per tenere buoni i publisher e per garantire i fondi necessari allo sviluppo del gioco. Il che significa dare delle scadenze poco realistiche a chi il gioco lo sviluppa (programmatori, designer, artisti e QA) quindi spesso significa che per far uscire il gioco in tempo, bisogna fare tanto crunch time.

Se sei fortunato lavori per uno studio che ti paga lo straordinario, se quando hai fatto il colloquio non sei riuscito a negoziare un buon contratto... eh son cazzi, le settimane da 90 ore lavorative weekend inclusi non sono un'eccezione durante il crunch.

Fare QA è un lavoro molto meno qualificato rispetto a un programmatore, essenzialmente devi rompere il gioco (e i coglioni del programmatore responsabile per la sezione del gioco rotta) e fare rapporto.

The old ways have decades to centuries of refinement by above averagely intelligent people and they are actually pretty good.

There's also the issues of managing it: keeping the content up to date and fixing hardware and software issues. 

At a rough guess: in the future there will be educational systems that are going to present the material and interact with each student in the way that suits thier individual learning style - not everyone learns the same way. 

It should also use the students interests to help present the material: little Johnny likes diggers ? That's a springboard oppertunity for everything from Pythagorian geometry to fluid mechanics.

It will also figure out on the fly what the student is weakest at and focus more on that - and alert a human teacher if there's still an issue.

EC authorises €448 million aid for construction of Lithuanian LNG terminal


The European Commission (EC) has found that aid for the construction and operation of a Liquefied Natural Gas terminal, to be developed in the Klaipėda Seaport in Lithuania by AB ‘Klaipėdos nafta’, complies with EU state aid rules, the official press release of the EC reads.

The project aims at increasing the security of gas supply within Lithuania by diversifying its supply sources. The Commission has concluded that the aid furthers EU energy goals without unduly distorting competition as the development of the LNG terminal will integrate Lithuania into the EU gas market and will stimulate competition on the Lithuanian gas markets.

Commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia stressed: “The aid will reduce Lithuania’s dependence on a single source of gas supplies and enhance its security of supply. By diversifying the gas supply sources, the terminal will also stimulate competition between gas suppliers, which in turn will benefit consumers.”

In 2013, Lithuania notified plans to support the construction of the Klaipėda LNG terminal with state guarantees backing up the loans needed to finance the up-front investment costs of the terminal.

 
In addition, the operator will receive the so-called ‘LNG Supplement’, a fee imposed on all users of the transmission system that will be collected by the Lithuanian transmission system operator and paid out to the operator of the terminal after authorisation of the Lithuanian energy regulator, in order to cover part of the investments costs and its maintenance costs during the lifetime of operation of the terminal.

 


The operator will be obliged to provide regasification services to any third party on regulated tariffs and under non-discriminatory conditions.

In present value terms, the various public support elements for the construction of the LNG Terminal amount to about €448 million.

The Commission’s investigation has found that the investment contributes to the security of supply and that the aid is necessary and proportionate to realise the investment. Moreover, the terminal will be open to third parties on non-discriminatory terms, ensuring that there are no undue distortions of competition.

As to the compensation for maintenance costs, it will amount to a yearly average of €17 million.

The Commission has found that this compensation for maintenance costs is in line with the EU Framework on services of general economic interest (SGEI, see IP/11/1571 and MEMO/11/929).

In particular, the objective criteria for defining eligible costs, the monitoring of the implementation by the Lithuanian energy regulator and the regulated return on investment will ensure that the operator of the terminal will not be overcompensated for discharging the public service entrusted to it",0,1385032500,null,0,false,0,cdjke9d,t3_1r2v8g,t1_cdjke9d,t1_cdjj3es,null,1428569152,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,acid2do,ESPA,BCN,"I can talk about Berlin, haven't lived in the rest of Germany, so here I go:

First, the bad:

1. **Food** I was surprised how badly food is prepared and how bad people eat. Please don't take this personally! For example, it is really hard to find a place to eat a steak that is not overcooked. Second, people don't care about food. Even engineers with nice salaries have lunch in student's cafeterias, pay 3 euros for some overcooked nudels or some other catering food when it is not kebab, sausages or other imbiss food. Don't ask what people eat for dinner at home, no wonder why it is so hard to find an apartment with a nice kitchen. I was expecting that the food culture was different as my home country, but not that bad.

2. **Privacy** After hearing some horror stories, one of the first things I've done is to buy a VPN... and I don't need to say why.

3. **Language** Way too hard than I expected. Even after a full year of intensive courses it is impossible for me to have a full conversation.

4. **Rudeness** Some people would actually like that, but not me. I think this is a very Berliner thing. I don't like going to a shop and be treated like if I was bothering them, I came to your place to spend some money so please at least be kind. When I travel around the world I always get shocked of how polite and nice is everyone, and then I realize that it is because I live in Berlin.

Now, the good:

5. **Values** People value good work and honesty. If you do good at your work, your boss will value that and will act (meaning from a salary rise to just a congratulation). Also people dislike cheaters, quitters and anyone who doesn't compromise on something. I follow the same values and I feel that I fit here. I never expected that and was a nice surprise.

6. **Trust** Linked to #5, people trust each other. There aren't any barriers in the public transport or my boss doesn't check if I am at the office or not. What matters is that I payed my train ticket and that I've done my work. But that could be in contrast with #2, so I just think this is a good Berliner thing.

&gt;Come hai trovato lavoro in GB?

Io ho studiato Games Production Management, alla Abertay University a Dundee in Scozia, tra l'altro dove sono nati GTA e Lemmings per nominarne 2.

Per il lavoro ho fatto tanto social networking e mi buttavo in qualsiasi opportunità quando ero uno studente. Spesso i nostri professori mandavano email per progettini, lavoretti, eventi dove sarebbero stati presenti i vari sviluppatori della zona, in più loro stessi facevano lavoro freelance o part time con le compagnie locali.

Quando ero nel primo e nel secondo anno ho iniziato a fare qualche esperienza part time per un piccolo studio locale che sviluppava giochi educativi, ci pagavano in buoni per la union (il pub/discoteca dell'università) quindi venivo letteralmente pagato a birra.

Ho anche fatto uno stage alla BBC, che mi ha permesso di conoscere molte persone che mi hanno poi aiutato a capire come funziona veramente la games industry, sono diventato amico di alcuni di loro, ero un regolare di Bert Wedensdays, Bert è un programmatore di Dundee che ogni mercoledì organizza una specie di happy hour per tutti quelli che lavorano nell'industria in città, ho conosciuto molte altre persone lì e sono riuscito ad ottenere un colloquio per Proper Games che al tempo lavorava con Ruffian Games per sviluppare Crackdown 2.

La cosa divertente mi è capitata la settimana dopo il colloquio: durante un incontro per discutere sul progresso della mia tesi con il mio Tutor Accademico, il suo vicino di scrivania mi da le congratulazioni per il nuovo lavoro, io non sapevo di cosa stesse parlando, chiedo quale lavoro, e lui mi risponde, hai fatto il colloquio la settimana scorsa? e allora so già che hanno scelto te. BAM!  mancava un mese alla consegna della tesi, avevo scritto solo i primi due capitoli e ora mi toccava lavorare di giorno e scrivere la tesi di notte.

The idea that I would want to buy a .33 L Flasche Kisten when a .5 L Flasche Kisten exists is just so foreign to me. I get made fun of to no end for this, but yeah. Back home, if one of my Kumpels suggested we buy the .33 L Flasche Kisten for a party, he'd be criticized for suggesting we bring child sized beers to a party.

Also, the general attitude towards (lack of) being service oriented here was definitely different. For example, in supermarkets. I used to work at Target in the U.S. (like real or a slightly less evil version of Walmart) and we were required to ask everyone we saw if we could help them.

This wasn't just a cultural thing. There's a business idea there: ""if someone can't find something, they won't buy it,"" and if you ask someone to help them they may ask you to help find something they were only half considering buying. This idea just doesn't exist here, and I think there is something deeper going on. 

There's a difference between Bekannte and Freund that doesn't really exist in American English. If I know someone, they are my friend. A phrase like ""a friend from work"", ""a friend from school"", etc. is common. But here, unless that person is ACTUALLY A FRIEND, they'll say Kollege or Kommilitone. I think this speaks to the general interactions German have with each other too. In the U.S. having a random conversation while in line at the supermarket, with a random stranger on the street is common. This has happened a few times to me in Germany, but I think only when the other person could sense I was foreign and wanted to show me extra politeness/niceness. It's definitely the exception.

I think what it comes down to, and this kind of supports what another person said: ""Germans don't beat around the bush with favors either"". They are direct. If they want something they'll ask for it, and interaction is very efficient. With Freunde, you can quatschen, but with others, not so much. In the U.S. we are a lot more friendly with people, but we don't really tell anyone everything. Even really close friends. I can think of only one or two friends I've had in my life where I wouldn't hesitate to tell them anything, and only one I still feel that strongly about. The other is still a great friend, but we just don't see each other as much. All my other friends, are good too, but we just aren't that close.

I would of course agree that the diplomatic relations between the UK and Ireland have significantly improved, to the point that they are ""good"", but I think it is naive to think that goes for everyone on the island. 

If you think that ""nobody brings it up"" then I guess you are lucky enough to have been raised and live somewhere that there hasn't been real trouble. Same with me, but I know others very well who were not so lucky and have lost family members under murky circumstances that they can only guess about.

true,emergency_poncho,EURO,European Union,"are you kidding? I'm sorry but academic knowledge is changing all the time. Pretty much 75% of what you know about dinosaurs is outdated. geology, archeology, history, etc... are changing. Sure, you may not go into much depth in these issues while in high school, but aspects of all of these are covered in high school classes, and this is the springboard for when student sin university decide what to specialize in. You had a horrible history teacher? You're almost definitely not going to major in history in university then. And vice versa if you had an amazing teacher, or the course really inspired you. My point is that you need to get to kids early, and high school is a part of that.

Second, more important point than the content of these subjects changing is the actual teaching methods. These are constantly being refined and improved. With a computer, a programme can make geometry come alive, with animations, 3-d images, practical examples (superimposing a dry exercise in geometry onto a house, and transforming the lesson into a designing your own house exercise, i.e.)

Third, the price of textbooks is extremely high. I did a quick amazon search, and prices for chemistry, science and history books are all in the 150 - 250 dollar range. For a textbook! Of course the school buys bulk and has savings, but the reality is that, for whatever reasons, the publishing industry makes books much more expensive than they need to be. The fact is that by removing the middle man and releasing e-books, you cut costs, widen your choice, and allow for more frequent updates and new editions.

New tablet technology is advancing by leaps and bounds. E-readers being bad for your eyes is a myth, they use technology that mimics ink on a real page.

Dipende dallo studio per cui lavori, Io 3 volte su 4 mi sono trovato bene, preferisco la Scozia all'Inghilterra e ovunque abbia lavorato mi sono sempre sentito valorizzato e relativamente soddisfatto del lavoro svolto.

&gt;Conosci o hai lavorato per Jagex?

Si conosco Jagex, rifiutai un colloquio con loro perchè avevo appena trovato lavoro, ho anche amici ed ex colleghi che lavorano lì ora!

&gt;Perché vuoi tornare in Italia?

Vari motivi:

Ho lasciato l'Italia a 18 anni, ho fatto 7 anni in GB, tra uni e lavoro, negli ultimi 4 anni sono tornato a casa solo per Natale, e devo essere sincero un po mi manca, mi mancano gli amici storici e vorrei vederli più spesso, sono una parte fondamentale della mia vita, e quindi se è possibile vorrei trovare qualcosa che sia più vicino a casa ma comunque riuscendo a seguire i miei sogni e le mie ambizioni. Credo non avrei sofferto di burnout se avessi avuto i miei amici nelle vicinanze l'anno scorso, quando hai solo amici che hai conosciuto tramite il lavoro diventa difficile staccare il cervello dai tuoi impegni lavorativi, vuoi o non vuoi con ""gli amici del mestiere"" la conversazione vira sempre in quella direzione.

Poi si parla sempre della crisi, della fuga all'estero dei talenti (odio la frase fuga dei cervelli, è stupida) tutti si lamentano, tutti criticano, sarò ingenuo ma voglio provare a cambiare, certo non salverò l'Italia dal baratro, ma voglio almeno provare a portare un pochino di professionalità nelle aziende Italiane del settore, e chissà un giorno aprire uno studio tutto mio.

&gt;Che qualifiche ci vogliono per fare il tuo lavoro?

Anche nessuna, se hai culo e sai dimostrare di avere le capacità giuste riusciresti a entrare in uno studio come tester e potresti far carriera usando il buon senso, certo quei giorni stanno scomparendo molto velocemente.

Se non conosci nessuno, come minimo devi avere una laurea in un campo informatico o in computer arts o in un campo affine.

&gt;Meglio l'estate o l'inverno?

Quest'anno ho fatto la mia prima estate Italiana in 4 anni, ho goduto come un porco che sguazza nella melma, per la prima volta in 4 anni sono andato al mare, la mia pelle aveva un colorito sano, C'ERA IL SOLE!!!!

Entre 2008 et fin 2011, l'euro s'est déprécié de 20% par rapport au dollar. Et [le pouvoir d'achat des français a pourtant augmenté](http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/pouvoir-d-achat-le-vrai-bilan-de-nicolas-sarkozy_289373.html).

Essaie au moins de trouver un exemple sourcé avec un début de raisonnement. On a des tonnes de données historiques qui montrent qu'une dévaluation ne provoque pas tout le temps une baisse du pouvoir d'achat.

&gt;les réformes Hartz concernaient les allocations sociales et de chômage et non pas les salaires

Quel a été l'impact sur les salaires et le coût du travail ? (en particulier il faut regarder Hartz II) Le fait est que ces réformes ont forcé les chômeurs à prendre des minijob et midijobs sans pour autant augmenter leurs revenus.

Encore une fois, regarde les données historiques stp.

&gt;Il faudra que quelqu'un prévienne Ryanair

Pour l'instant, il n'y a aucun Comac. L'accord entre Ryanair et Comac n'est évidemment qu'un message pour faire peur à Boeing et faire pression sur les prix. Et le jour où un Comac ou Avic, massivement subventionnés/contrôlés par l'État Chinois, se posera en Europe, ce sera un très bon exemple de protectionnisme réussi. Tout comme Airbus EST un très bon exemple de capitalisme d'État.

Encore une fois, l'aéronautique est un très mauvais exemple de dénonciation du protectionnisme.

Après, [j'ai lu cette source](http://www.latribune.fr/entreprises-finance/industrie/aeronautique-defense/20120626trib000705807/aeronautique-la-chine-lance-la-guerre-des-normes-avec-les-europeens.html), qui disait :

*Airbus, si il le voulait, ne pourrait qu'exporter sa production chinoise aux pays ayant signé un accord bilatéral avec la Chine dans le domaine de l'aviation. Ce qui n'est pas le cas de l'Union européenne. Un avion ""made in China"" ne peut se poser sur le sol européen sans cet accord.*

Si tu en as des meilleures qui montrent ton point de vue, n'hésite pas.

&gt;tu rouspètes sur la nuance entre ""axe"" et ""alliance"".

Absolument. On emploie sans arrêt des termes à connotation nazie quand on parle du FN, je ne le laisse pas passer. Quand on compare la politique étrangère du FN à l'Axe, c'est selon moi de la manip que je ne peux laisser passer. Comme quand on qualifie sa politique intérieur de nationale et socialiste... Je le prends comme un mensonge.

&gt;Je parlerai plutôt de génuflexions en direction à Moscou.

Tout comme je parle actuellement de génuflexions en direction de Jérusalem. C'est subjectif évidemment. Est-on soumis à Israël actuellement ? Est-on soumis aux US actuellement ?

Est-ce que se rapprocher de la Russie est une soumission ou plutôt la fin de la soumission actuelle ?

En tout cas, il s'agit avant tout d'arrêter l'interventionnisme actuel.

true,OvidPerl,FRAN,France,"Holy crap, this is going to be interesting. First, here's a tidbit from the article:

&gt; Job centres in the state of Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania reported office workers receiving €1.37 an hour, a delivery driver on €1.55 an hour and a receptionist on €2.54 an hour.

What's really going to make this interesting is how this will impact exports. Many people are concerned that France is struggling because she refuses to adopt strict austerity measures, but they ignore the fact that [France is doing much better than pundits think](http://www.overseas-exile.com/2013/11/red-state-france-is-doing-fine-thank-you.html). However, one obstacle to France getting back on her feet is Germany's wages. Here's the problem.

Germany exports many goods to foreign countries. However, [Germany pays many workers less than €6 an hour, while France has a €9.50 minimum wage](http://www.france24.com/en/20130915-low-wages-flip-side-booming-german-economy). As a result, German export goods are relatively inexpensive and this leads to high demand. What *usually* happens in this high demand scenario is that consumers will then start purchasing large quantities of the exporting nation's currency to buy that nation's goods, but this drives up the value of that currency, resulting in the goods costing more. However, much of German's export market is to other nations on the euro, ensuring that the value of the German currency *can't* rise, thus artificially keeping the price of their goods low.

If Germany adopts a minimum wage that is considerably more than the wages their export-producing workers currently earn, this will drive up the cost of German exports and will give surrounding countries a chance to be more competitive with Germany.

In the short run, this will help many German workers, but could cause widespread disruptions in the German economy. In the long run, this would be good for Europe, but German's may be upset at a leveled playing field and weaker exports, but it will be hard to roll back a minimum wage once it goes into effect.

As I live in France, I'm very happy to hear that this might happen, but it could be very disruptive while economies adjust.

**Update**: Merkel's in a real bind on this one. With more than 80% of German's supporting a minimum wage (per the article), she can't really afford to say ""no"". However, she knows damned well that German's ""engine of Europe"" status is largely due to strong exports. She doesn't want to damage that, but if she pitches that the German people, she's going to piss off Hollande and many other European leaders who have long claimed that Germany's low wages are giving them an unfair competitive edge.

Many government's try to maintain exports via tariffs to protect domestic industries and subsidies/tax benefits to exporters. This sort of anti-competitive behavior, while understandable, doesn't work fly in the EU. Thus, Germany's reluctance to tamper with their low wages. I fully expect some work from the Merkel administration to try to address this.

The low quality beef is because the environment of Germany isn't particularly suitable to cows.

I grew up on an island, where fish was a part of my daily life, so moving to landlocked Berlin was a huge shock to me. Many of my friends had never even seen a lobster, much less eaten one.

That being said, I now live in the Netherlands, where beef is substantially cheaper than pork and I can't walk 5 minutes without running into a fish shop or stand.

true,balanceofpain,null,null,"&gt; Ströbele bezieht klar Stellung und fordert Maßnahmen um die massenhafte Verletzung von Bürgerrechten in Deutschland zu verhindern. Steinmeier redet um den heißen Brei herum und stellt Fragen anstatt Antworten zu geben - ganz im (erfolgreichen) Stile Merkels.

Klar Stellung zu beziehen, ist noch keine intellektuelle Leistung – das kann jeder, wenn er nicht begründen muss, warum so und nicht anders. Hingegen war schon die Formulierung der Fragen Steinmeiers nichttrivial, weil sie die Erkenntnis eines neuartigen konzeptuellen Konflikts und dessen begriffliche Eingrenzung voraussetzt. Schon allein deswegen ist seine Rede Ströbeles auch inhaltlich weit überlegen. An seinen Fragen oder zumindest ähnlichen werden Experten für Völkerrecht auf Jahre zu knabbern haben, weil seine Integration mit der Nichtterritorialität des Internet schwierig ist. Insofern war Merkels Diktum vom Internet als Neuland zutreffend.

Ströbeles Masche besteht darin, dass er ignoriert, was die Amerikaner dazu getrieben hat, die Telekommunikationsüberwachung derart auszuweiten: die den modernen Kommunikationstechnologien innewohnende Macht und die sich daraus ergebenden Herausforderungen für die ureigene Aufgabe des Staates, seine territoriale Integrität zu wahren. Er tut so, als gäbe es hier gar kein Problem, als sei die Situation im Jahre 2013 dieselbe wie 1980, und beantwortet Fragen von heute mit Antworten von damals. Deswegen sind alle seine Forderungen selbst dann Humbug, wenn sie in der Sache richtig sein mögen. Das Richtige aus falschen Gründen zu fordern, ist kein Argument für, sondern gegen die eigene Position. Seine Masche funktioniert deshalb, weil die meisten Menschen das Problem eben sowenig verstanden haben wie er und daher dazu übergehen, die Heuristiken ihrer Alltagserfahrung auf die internationale Politik zu übertragen. Die Ergebnisse findet man auf Twitter und in den Kommentarsektionen der Webseiten deutschsprachiger Zeitungen, aber auch in /r/de.

&gt; Ströbele sagt doch ganz klar, ihm geht es um du Überwachung der Privatpersonen, de 80 Millionen. Das ist kein antiamerikanisches, nationalisitsches Klientel, sondern das sind die Bürger einer Demokratie.

Es sind dieselben 80 Millionen, die seit Jahrzehnten die sukzessive Entkernung der Grundrechte klaglos hinnehmen oder sogar billigen, und die sich jetzt über die Überwachung nur deshalb echauffieren, weil Deutschland dadurch als Bückling der USA wahrgenommen wird, während sie von der notwendigen deutschen Komplizenschaft nichts wissen wollen.

Was soll Merkel denn machen? US-Diplomaten allesamt zu Personae non gratae erklären? Für die Datenschutzbeauftragten Zutritt zu US-Einrichtungen auf deutschem Boden fordern? Eine Funkwellen abschirmende Kuppel um die US-Botschaft errichten?  Wie stark soll denn das PKGr Ströbeles Meinung nach gestärkt werden?  Was soll ein gestärktes PKGr dann besser machen und wie, wenn Briten und Amerikaner deutschen Internetverkehr, der durch ihr Land kommt, abhören?  Ströbele will von Merkel nichts weiter, als die Amerikaner dazu aufzufordern, sich den Deutschen gegenüber blind zu machen. Details sind für Ströbele und seine Jünger nebensächlich.

Ströbele stellt seine Forderungen nur deshalb, weil er weiß, dass sie nicht zu erfüllen sind – Botschaften sind unverletzlich, und die Amerikaner können darin bis zu ihrer Ausweisung im Grunde tun, was sie wollen.  Die Stärkung der Datenschutzbeauftragten und der parlamentarischen Kontrolle werden daran in keiner Weise rühren.  Um das Wie und Warum drückt er sich denn auch, weil er weiß, dass seiner Klientel die intellektuelle Fähigkeit fehlt, sich damit auseinanderzusetzen.  Er führt die Regierung durch unrealistische Forderungen vor, und genau so sollte Oppositionsarbeit nicht laufen.

Es wäre vollkommen egal, ob Merkel nun die Forderungen Ströbeles umsetzen würde: solange äquivalente Änderungen nicht auch in den USA und allen anderen NATO-Republiken durchgeführt werden und die Sicherheitsarchitektur des Westens in toto daran angepasst wird, würde Deutschland durch sein Vorpreschen zu einem verwundbaren Punkt in dieser: Merkel und Steinmeier wissen sehr gut, dass sie das wg. der Hamburger Terrorzelle nicht zulassen können, weil Deutschland sich dadurch auf lange Sicht isolierte, an Sicherheit verlöre, und über dies die US-Spionage gegen Deutschland dann gerechtfertigt wäre.  Ströbele hingegen weiß, dass er niemals liefern müssen wird, und kann deswegen dem Volk, das von alledem keine Ahnung hat, weil es lieber Volker Pispers zuhört, als schwierige und dröge Bücher ohne Bilder zu lesen, erzählen, was es hören will.

&gt; Steinmeier bezieht meines Erachtens nicht wirklich Stellung, er versucht sich um klare Ansagen zu drücken. Er sagt welche Fragen wir uns stellen müssen, aber er gibt nicht seine Antworten zu diesen Fragen.

Marx bemerkte ganz richtig, dass die Formulierung einer Frage ihre Lösung ist.  Steinmeier hat seine Antworten schon wegen der knappen Redezeit nicht ausformuliert, aber dass er vom »Völkerrecht im Netz« spricht, zeigt im Grunde schon, wohin er die Reise gehen sehen will.  Die Details ergeben sich aus der Natur der Sache, und ein paar habe ich im ersten Kommentar genannt.

Steinmeier bezieht keine Stellung und gibt keine klaren Ansagen, weil das nicht nur aus seiner Sicht sinnlos ist, denn er erkennt, dass Deutschland und die USA sich demselben Problem gegenüber sehen, und dass jetzt der US-Kongress und die amerikanische Öffentlichkeit am Zug sind.  Ihnen obliegt die Aufgabe, zu entscheiden, ob und, wenn ja, wie sie die Balance zwischen Sicherheit und Freiheit neu austarieren wollen und wie diese neue Balance in Zukunft das Wesen der amerikanischen Republik bestimmen wird.  Erst wenn die Amerikaner ihre Antwort gefunden haben werden, werden ihre Partner entscheiden können, wie sie sich dazu verhalten werden.  Entweder werden sie sich anpassen, oder sie werden sich unter Inkaufnahme negativer Auswirkungen auf die gegenseitigen Beziehungen mit einem eigenen Weg davon abgrenzen.  Das ist aber alles noch sehr weit weg.

&gt; Eine Ausnahme bildet die Forderung nach einem ""Völkerrecht im Netz"" was mir wieder zeigt wie wenig technisches Wissen unsere Politiker vom Internet haben - so etwas ist einfach unrealistisch und auch garnicht das Problem.

Dein ganzer Kommentar zeigt mir, wie wenig Du über Völkerrecht weißt.  Denn wenn Du auch nur ein Quentchen Ahnung davon hättest, wüsstest Du, dass das Prinzip der Territorialität, d.h. die Anerkennung, Wahrung und Sicherung definierter Grenzen, dafür essenziell ist, und zwar nicht erst seit gestern, sondern seit dem Westfälischen Frieden.  Wenn das Internet in einer nicht totalüberwachten Form und das Völkerrecht miteinander integriert werden sollen (und das ist sehr wohl das Problem), dann muss in der Territorialitätsfrage eines von beiden dem anderen weichen.  Wenn das Internet weichen sollte, wird das in der Praxis aussehen wie oben beschrieben.  Die Alternative wäre, das Völkerrecht zumindest teilweise des Territorialitätsprinzips zu entledigen, und wie das in der Praxis aussehen soll, kann ich mir nicht einmal im Ansatz vorstellen.  Wer es kann, täte gut daran, das laut und wiederholt mitzuteilen, da viel Zeit nicht bleiben wird, die teilweise Territorialisierung des Internet zu verhindern.  Sollte die Integration ausbleiben, wird ein de facto totalüberwachtes Internet die unvermeidliche Folge sein.

&gt; Die Balance von Freiheit und Sicherheit hat sich zu Ungunsten der Freiheit verschoben.  Oder wie er es nennen würde ""aus den Fugen geraten"".  Ein Ansatz wäre es, diese wieder zu stärken, insbesondere im Kontext Internet.  Netzneutralität gesetzlich verankern, Vorratsdatebspeicherung einschränken, über die simple Technik der Verschlüsselung von Kommunikation aufklären und diese in großem Maße anwenden.

Du machst es genau wie Ströbele: Die Frage, *warum* hier etwas aus den Fugen geraten ist, schert Dich nicht.  Du setzt die Möglichkeit einer Verschiebung der Balance zu Gunsten der Freiheit, ohne dass dabei die Waage vom Tisch fällt, bereits unkritisch voraus, obwohl diese Möglichkeit erst zu zeigen wäre.  Wenn nämlich die dem unregulierten Internet innewohnende Macht für Staaten bestandsgefährdende Ausmaße annimmt, dann können nach dem Völkerrecht gar nicht anders, als hier die Reißleine zu ziehen.  Aus der Sicht des Staates ist der Fortbestand der die Freiheit durchsetzenden Instanz von größerer Wichtigkeit als diese.  Deswegen kann es durchaus sein, das in 15 oder 20 Jahren oder schon früher das Internet in der heutigen, grenzenlosen Form nicht mehr existieren wird.  Und deswegen ist es auch müßig, über Bürgerrechtsaspekte im Netz zu reden, solange diese völkerrechtliche Frage ungeklärt ist.

&gt; Bevor wie die USA für ihre Überwachung kritisieren müssen wir selbst zeigen, dass uns Bürgerrechte wichtiger sind als totale Überwachung.

Dein Fehler ist, dass Du glaubst, es würde in den USA irgendjemanden interessieren, was die Deutschen tun oder nicht tun.  Davon nimmt da keiner Notiz, denn die haben mit sich selbst genug zu schaffen.  Wenn irgendein Deutscher einem Amerikaner Vorhaltungen darüber machen würde, wie eine richtige Balance zwischen Freiheit und Sicherheit auszusehen hätte, dann würde dieser Fragen stellen wie »Warum haben die deutschen Dienste bei der Aufdeckung der Hamburger Terrorzelle versagt?« oder »Warum ist die deutsche Spionageabwehr so inkompetent, dass sie ohne [Hilfe des FBI das Spionenehepaar Anschlag nicht hätte enttarnen können](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/-a-877395-druck.html)?« oder »Wie kann es sein, dass in Deutschland angesichts des Bekanntwerdens der NSA-Affäre die CDU eines ihrer besten Ergebnisse bei einer Bundestagswahl erzielt hat?« Wer andere glauben machen will, dass die Deutschen sich um Freiheit und Bürgerrechte scheren, macht sich lächerlich, denn sie haben ihre Aushöhlung stets ohne großes Murren hingenommen.

What a weird attempt at a strawman argument. You can assume any old bullshit you want. But the actual facts are inescapable. 

Sancta Sophia is a very historically important Christian monument the identity of which Muslims tried to erase. This is quite simply what happened. Muslim Turks tried to hide the church's Christian character by gutting it, destroying its Christian artefacts (reportedly masterpieces all)  and then sticking some minarets to it, all so they could pretend that it was a mosque. Did that actually make it one? You seem to think so.

Do go to the standing ruin that is today's Sancta Sophia in Constantinople. Though it still manages to be magnificent, think of the astounding cathedrals you can see today in Rome and remember that Sancta Sophia was the greatest and most splendid of all churches, far greater than any in Rome. If you have any sense of history, this should break your heart. 

Of course, instead of addressing this very simple issue, you want to make this about some unrelated nationalistic nonsense.

As a result, German export goods are relatively inexpensive and this leads to high demand. What usually happens in this high demand scenario is that consumers will then start purchasing large quantities of the exporting nation's currency to buy that nation's goods, but this drives up the value of that currency, resulting in the goods costing more. However, much of German's export market is to other nations on the euro, ensuring that the value of the German currency can't rise, thus artificially keeping the price of their goods low.

My argument rests on the fact that some of the advantages of e-textbooks is that they are cheaper and can be updated more easily. Your counter arguments don't get around that, you just say that aren't that expensive (a quick amazon search for high school textbooks reveals that they cost anywhere from $30 - $200, and that's for one.

This aspect of the troubles is just being widely reported by the media at the moment as former MRF members have come forward for the Panorama investigation and that is the only reason why they are reporting on it now, it is not like the British government has just lifted secret sanctions on the media.

Con f12010 si ps3 non ho mai avuto quei problemi, a parte il bug del pit stop e del framerate a monaco, che è stato poi risolto con una patch.

Un walkthrough breaker puo essere considerato un crash che non ti permette di continuare la progressione del gioco, mai.  Non lo vedresti mai in un gioco che è stato rilasciato, perchè implica un errore grave nella programmazione del gioco. 

Per essere chiari, se ogni tanto ti si blocca la play/xbox non sei di fronte a un walkthrough breaker, un esempio di un WB in F1 201x sarebbe: l'user osserva un crash alla partenza della gara di campionato di Monza quando la prima luce rossa si spegne, il crash avviene 10 volte su 10 seguendo i passi indicati dal tester. L'user non può proseguire il campionato.

Un salvataggio corrotto non è un WB perchè volendo c'è un modo di continuare a giocare. Va anche detto che gli avvisi su ogni gioco che dicono di non spegnere la console mentre l'icona del salvataggio o la lucetta dell HDD sono accesi/lampeggiano non la mettono perchè fa figo, il motivo c'è ed è proprio per evitare salvataggi corrotti.

Scherzi a parte, la settimana dopo essermi licenziato lo studio ha chiuso, quindi avrei dovuto farlo molto prima.

All'inizio quando sono tornato in Italia il mio medico di famiglia mi ha visto in condizioni pietose, in 2 settimane avevo perso 10 chili, non dormivo più di un ora a notte e avevo multipli attacchi di panico al giorno, considerando che non ho mai avuto problemi di ansia o di depressione è inutile dire che la situazione era più che strana, ha capito subito quali erano i miei problemi, infatti la prima cosa che mi ha detto è stata hai letteralmente fritto il tuo sistema nervoso, hai passato il punto di non ritorno e ora qualsiasi sciocchezza ti crea ansia/panico.

Come prima cosa mi ha prescritto gli SSRI per l'ansia e il Trazodone per dormire, Trazodone che è stato poi eliminato un paio di mesetti dopo, quando eravamo ormai sicuri di aver riallenato il cervello a dormire in maniera normale.

L'antidepressivo invece ho smesso di prenderlo da poco, anche se in effetti i sintomi dell'ansia sono spariti del tutto dopo 2-3 mesi, ma il trattamento per evitare ricadute andava completato.

Con il burnout non si scherza, io sono arrivato al punto di non funzionare più come essere umano, e non faccio fatica ad ammetterlo mi son cagato sotto dalla paura quando ho iniziato a non mangiare/dormire e ad avere attacchi di panico.

Alle terapie con medicinali però vanno aggiunte altre cose:

-  il mio medico mi aveva chiesto di avere un diario dove scrivevo i miei pensieri e sentimenti quando sentivo che stava per arrivare un attacco di panico, o anche durante un attacco, che ha aiutato moltissimo a analizzare il problema, e sopratutto a valutare le mie priorità nella vita.

- Ho smesso di bere caffè, sono passato da una media di 4-5 tazzine al giorno al cappuccino occasionale se mi va di andare a far  colazione al bar.

- ho smesso di fumare 

- Vado a correre più spesso, aiuta a tenermi energetico, butto un po di panza ed è anti stress

- inizio a sbattermene della carriera, è inutile mettermi pressioni addosso, sono bravo in quello che faccio, ogni cosa ha il suo tempo e non mi serve cercare di bruciare le tappe... la gavetta la dobbiamo fare tutti.

true,sir_wolfie,EURO,Union européenne,"The EU as it currently stands is illegitimate. The only countries who put the euro to the vote rejected it, others didn't get a vote on such a vital change. The Lisbon Treaty was rejected by the French and Dutch when it was called the European Constitutional Treaty but they got it imposed on them anyway. I am fully aware of the arguments that such things can be legitimately done through parliaments without referendums, there's no need for federalists to restate them here, I just don't accept those arguments as legitimate. If you make the argument that the people are too stupid to decide on these big things, then you are basically saying the people are too stupid to decide on anything. That's an anti-democratic argument to its very core. Besides, if the people who created the euro are so smart, why are multiple countries having millions plunged into poverty and having their social fabric torn apart? Perhaps our lords and masters are not as smart as they think. It's well worth noting that the eurosceptics warned of the euro causing problems.  

From the video we see that 1/3rd don't even identify as Europeans on any level, the others most likely putting it behind their national identity anyway. How can you get all these common policies the federalists want with Belgian levels of discord? They aren't going to be putting anything to the vote I can tell you that. I am sure the people in the poorer countries want welfare and pensions paid to them from the richer ones and are behind some of those figures, but even they don't add up to an EU-wide majority on those things, and there is no EU-wide referendum process to get them even if you had a majority. It will have to just be imposed undemocratically on the north.

I recommend catching the #7 or #20 (pretty sure those are still the numbers) bus in Piazza San Marco for a walk around Fiesole. It's a small town that predates Roman Florence (Because it's Etruscan) and has a Roman Amphitheater as well as a really amazing view of the city of Florence if you walk up the small steep road to [this](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Fiesole,+Florence,+Italy&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=43.8071,11.290346&amp;spn=0.0005,0.001316&amp;sll=29.477608,-98.514404&amp;sspn=0.618074,1.347198&amp;oq=fiesole&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Fiesole,+Firenze,+Toscana,+Italy&amp;z=20) park here. 

The main piazza has some nice restaurants too, if you are a meat eater then I recommend ordering a bistecca alla Fiorentina from Trattoria Tullio while there (if you are there for dinner). Otherwise, if you are not a huge meat eater then you should get anything with funghi porcini wherever possible. (if you like mushrooms) 

Oh.. also on the food subject. Remember that wild game is a specialty of the Italians. If you wild boar on the menu or hare, get it. It's gonna be good. And I always recommend crostini misti to start the meal. 

Oh also. Not sure how nerdy you are, but the Leonardo Da Vinci museum http://www.mostredileonardo.com/ in Florence is one of my favorites. You can only take so many museums and churches full of art. This one has a bunch of neat old inventions and funky old medical tools and stuff. [La Specola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Specola) is another great funky museum and a good addition to a trip to the Pitti Palace (boboli gardens). 

One last thing. Get a leather jacket in the market but DO NOT pay full price. If anybody tries to get you to pay anything over 2/3 the marked price just walk away. You should be able to haggle them WAY down but seriously. Don't get suckered. They are pushy as fuck so stand your ground, check the merchandise thoroughly before buying, and don't pay anywhere near full price.

By your own argument, the Turks defaced Constantinople, a shining example of Greek culture and arhitecture and the centre of Orthodox Christianity. Should it be returned to the Greeks? 

&gt;Sancta Sophia is a very historically important Christian monument the identity of which Muslims tried to erase. 

They also preserved it. In fact, without the Ottomans it would have probably crumbled to the ground. 

&gt;Muslim Turks tried to hide the church's Christian character by gutting it, destroying its Christian artefacts (reportedly masterpieces all) and then sticking some minarets to it, all so they could pretend that it was a mosque.

Would you have prefered it if they had destroyed it?

&gt;Did that actually make it one? You seem to think so.

Unless you can prove it wasn't turned into a mosque, it's the truth.

&gt;Do go to the standing ruin that is today's Sancta Sophia in Constantinople. Though it still manages to be magnificent, think of the astounding cathedrals you can see today in Rome and remember that Sancta Sophia was the greatest and most splendid of all churches, far greater than any in Rome. If you have any sense of history, this should break your heart. 

I might have understood you if it were razed to the ground but it wasn't, it's still there. It might belong to a different religion now but its history is intact.

So while I am sure you will debate over the definitions I find the following to be corrupt and/or what you might call ""rotten"": CAP payments to airlines, abuse of the fisheries by Spain with no enforcement, accounts not signed off for 19 years, lack of prosecutions in the MEP expenses scandal, admissions huge portions of spending have no proper oversight, ignoring referendum results, funding web troll propaganda agents to debunk EU ""myths"", the parliamentary video service head honchos telling the parliamentary cameramen ""you are not here to film dissent"", many of the regulations which have obviously be put forward at the behest of major corporations to protect them from competitors. I would also consider the special EU tax-rates to be a kind of rotten ""some animals are more equal than others"". Even if it's technically legal it's a rotten political class helping themselves to loads of gravy with no consent from the governed. So yes it is considered highly corrupt and rotten by many people and there are tons of cases. I read the Europhile texts on why they want an EU and/or a USE, it always surprises me that most europhiles haven't read the real critiques of the EU and just respond to Daily Mail xenophobic racist strawmen like there's nothing wrong with the EU.  

I would reverse your question and ask why you think we need to point it out, why is the burden of evidence on us? The federalists want a United States of Europe. The United States of America has far more accountability mechanisms and is more democratic than the EU, but Washington is a cesspit of corruption. What evidence makes you federalists think that there's something special about Brussels or the people in it that will mean that won't happen here? Are our democratically unaccountable bureaucrats going to magically be not corrupt because of their technocratic expertise (which in its unlimited genius gave us the euro)? Please. Next you will be asking us to point the specifics of UN corruption as if it's some innocent clean utopia and we're madmen for suggesting otherwise.

&gt;Quale è stato il primo videogioco a cui hai giocato? E quale il più bello? 

La passione è nata subito, grazie a mio zio in Scozia, penso di aver avuto 3-4 anni quando ho giocato per la prima volta a Lemmings di DMA e a Grand Prix Circuit di Accolade, l'estate dopo mio zio manda il suo PC in Italia, nel mio paesello ero l'unico ad averne uno, ed ero anche l'unico a saperlo usare, ci girava Windows 3.1 e avevo 4-5 giochi max, tra cui Lemmings e Grand Prix Circuit.  

Non ho un gioco più bello, di sicuro non dimenticherò mai l'intro per  GP circuit: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-y8dvsLYJM ma puramente per motivi affettivi, Age of Empires II è li su tra i giochi migliori di sempre per me, forse anche GTA II e GTA Vice City/San Andreas meritano di essere nominati.

&gt;Quale videogioco (se c'è stato) ti ha fatto dire ""avrei proprio voluto pensarlo/svilupparlo io""?

GTA II è stato il momento in cui ho deciso, questo è quello che voglio fare da grande, sopratutto dopo aver scoperto che è stato ideato a Dundee, in Scozia, dove c'è metà della mia famiglia.

As they are not Daily Mail journalists presumably they checked some of the sources and cases.  

Checking one case from the video for ourselves, [that of Lufthansa](http://farmsubsidy.openspending.org/search/?q=lufthansa), it seems [they did receive subsidies in quite large amounts that are specifically listed](http://farmsubsidy.openspending.org/GB/recipient/GB130704/lsg-lufthansa-serviceskychefsgcc-limited/). I'd imagine therefore with the journalists checking and one case confirmed you would concede the claims that they received the money are true and that it's quite likely the other claims regarding cruise ships are also true.  

You are of course welcome to argue that these transfers are appropriate, I would of course disagree. On top of that, perhaps I will get a reference but a man does not live by talk alone and I have some other matters to attend to, I distinctly recall small farmers saying the payment application process was too onerous. So lawyers and administrators in large corporations not involved in farming glide through all the forms and procedures while some actual farmers, who are not the most bureaucratically literate people in our societies shall we say, find it too difficult and give up. I would count that as a deeply flawed and failed policy even if we dance around with the semantics of the word ""corruption"" from earlier in the discussion and say the airlines are merely rationally applying for all they can, similar to the ""tax minimisation is rational versus illegal tax avoidance"" argument. It's just a failure.   

How is this more efficient than putting the billions back in people's pockets and just letting them decide what to buy themselves and having capitalism allocate these resources? This is a classic market without moral issues requiring intervention like, say, healthcare services require. Milk does not need state administration or intervention. Additionally how is it more moral to be giving the money to farms run by the UK royal family, rather than letting consumers choose to buy products from Africa where people there can develop with the dignity of commerce rather than subsist on the dubious efficacy of foreign aid (which the EU taxpayer pays for as well, with maybe a condescending visit from Prince Charles himself to tell them they should be glad to be living in mud huts because it's more authentic)?

Landowners of all cuts, styles and measures have been claiming CAP subsidies, including airfields, which is in part what they're trying to reform but are struggling with.

In addition to that the link that was provided referenced farmsubsidies.org , the first article on which explains how 92% of all CAP beneficiaries are kept secret, on which the ECJ has itself called EU transparency laws as 'invalid' when it comes to CAP.

http://farmsubsidy.openspending.org/news/features/2012-data-harvest/

At this stage it's not even controversial to *expect* it.  The regional aid Commissioner on the 2007-2013 €347bn sister cohesion fund has recently said""The focus was more on the absorption of funds than on their actual impact"" admitting a 'lack of strategy' - so they're not really watching where money is going.  That's the unrelated cohesion fund, but if that's how things are run then it's no shock that where it was a scandal of CAP funds going to airports that this year it was bullfights and tv stations that got reported.   

Pillar One of the CAP is wide open to abuse, and then the EU are cutting down on transparency and countries are withholding data so people can't know where it's going.

We must also compare the policy against other uses of the money, like investments in medical device research and development which I would argue is more important than paying bureaucrats high salaries at special tax rates to subsidise milk on airplanes through complex mechanisms.  

That you find this acceptable is just staggering. Your shrugging dismissal of this issue while saying in theory reform would be good is why it never gets reformed. And it's not just 60,000 a year for one company, it's over one million in total. So that's sixteen and a half years at your rate, which is not the case as it was done in a shorter time so it has to be higher. Plus it's many companies, and every other policy has similar problems because the same shrugging attitude to tax payers money and to reform is taken. When you add that all up there are mind boggling amounts being wasted. This ""there's nothing wrong with the EU, well ok there are some things wrong, but it's not a big deal and here's some nitpicking about one little specific case"" is similar to your rhetoric, and that of the EU elite, on referendums. Sure they are a good idea in theory, we're all democrats here, just not on this specific issue because of this and that, just not today some other day.  

The core europhile argument at present is to give them more control, more money, to help fight the flaws in the euro. With this kind of attitude to people's money is it any surprise that people are just aching to give the consensus a punch in the face at the next EU elections? ""But you can't do that, what about World War III, diversity, my inflated salary and blah blah blah"".

Of course it wouldn't! It would serve much better as what it is than as what it is not. Would the Musaeum of Alexandria (aka library of Alexandria) serve much better as a mosque or a church than as a museum/library? 

Sancta Sophia was designed by illustrious physicist and mathematician  specifically to be a church. It was then built to be a church. And it was finally inaugurated as a fucking church to then be used as a church. I guess that this must then make it ... *a mosque ... or a museum*!

The EU originally published the information, and was forced by a case to withdraw it - from your link:

&gt;The backsliding on transparency has come in the wake of a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union which states that EU rules on transparency were ‘invalid’ because of concerns that publication of data on payments to private individuals (‘natural persons’) would violate their right to privacy. It seems some member states are using a very broad definition of ‘natural person’ to keep as much data as possible from entering the public domain. 

So in this case it's not ""the EU"" trying to be opaque, it's the EU trying to be transparent and being forced not to be by individuals and member states. And then being blamed for it, of course.

I don't particularly agree with the right of individuals to keep secret how much they receive in the way of CAP subsidies, but I can see their point, and can see how the right to privacy, which written into the Charter, and thus applicable to such disclosure by the EU, would trump the transparency argument. I'd prefer for the EU to be able to set a standard for 'natural person' that excluded companies, but it's a legally vital definition that the EU doesn't have the power to change.

So the worker will paid more (and the employers is paid less) which will mean that workers will spend more (and the employers spend less) and this will lead to more demand?

How about employers who have minimum wage workers will have more costs associated with them and will fire some otherwise they won't be able to compete and these new workers will be unemployed (meaning demand will fall)?

Given it's become a common tactic of europhiles on here to scream ""give me a source!"" to just about any claim sceptics make, and given my good faith provision of those sources at a not inconsiderable cost of time to myself elsewhere in this thread, I am going to have to ask for a solid source for this one. A source on the 85% would also be nice, as I have never encountered either of these figures before your reddit comment so they are mysterious to me and I'd like to know more.  

But provisionally, even if we take them both to be true, the administration of 85% of funds, say in Bulgaria, is still money from a Swedish taxpayer being maladministered. Part of the eurosceptic case is that these countries are not equal in this regard and therefore we don't want them voting or administering funds that we provide. I imagine Sweden as a quite left wing rich country has an extensive foreign aid budget. A taxpayer could rightly say ""I wish for the money to be administered through the national government for aid to the poorest Africans rather than handed over to the EU which then hands it over to, although poor, substantially richer Bulgarians. Or to airports with no traffic in Spain, who are richer again"". There might not be any ""errors"" in the airport building in Spain, just a crappy business case. The lines between direct corruption, and cynically sloping money around to interest groups and voting blocs blur things a little. If he or she is one of the many people in Sweden who don't directly identify as European, then poorly administered aid to people on tens of thousands or thousands a year in Europe versus reasonably administered aid to people on hundreds a year in Africa is a fairly simple case to get upset about.

1. Go hiking in the Taunus ""mountains"" (Hessen) and then visit the old Roman castellum ""Saalburg"" close to Bad Homburg. It's really interesting if you are into history. Plus: Bad Homburg is a really beautiful town (I grew up there). http://www.saalburgmuseum.de/english/sb_en_home.html

2. Visit a football match at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund (NRW) - even though you might know nothing about football (soccer) - the atmosphere is GREAT and the beer is very tasty ;-). 
It is said that the fans of the Dortmund team (Borussia Dortmund / BVB) are the best in Europe (I of course have to agree, because I'm one of them ;-).
Check this out (vid in English):  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWuy_s647g4&amp;list=FLTDgmo-x6muEjBAQHacdguA&amp;feature=mh_lolz

3. Go to an old brewery in Cologne (NRW) and have a Kölsch beer - then talk to/connect with the people there. People in Cologne are much more open than the rest of us Germans. When I moved there, I was astonished by the openness of the people. You will find some ""natives"" to talk to in no time.  
I would recommend the Päffgen brewery. It's really nice and - sort of - typical German http://www.paeffgen-koelsch.de/brauhaus/

4. Go to Frankfurt am Main (Hessen) and have some cocktails in the Maintower Bar (http://www.maintower-restaurant.de/pages/startseite/restaurant.php) They have GREAT drinks (also great food) and the view from the 30th floor over the city is amazingly beautiful. 

5. Go to Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Bavaria - http://www.gapa.de/) and go hiking in the mountains. The landscape is just very, VERY (!) beautiful and when you come back after a long and exhausting day of walking, you should go to a restaurant and buy yourself a ""Schweinshaxn mit Knödeln"" (=pork hock with dumplings). That's as German as it can get. Aaaand it's delicious!

But if you want a history lesson, fine:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkanization        
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_of_Yugoslavia

The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was formed in 1929, at a time of a great global economic crisis...

Post second world war it became Communist and was held together by authoritarian government.  The Berlin Wall came down in 1989, a domino effect occurred, and by 1991 we had Balkanistation again with the Yugoslav Wars.

Fast forward a bit and people rejected an EU constitution, and yet in all but name it was forced through with Lisbon.  They still have a flag, they still stand up to the anthem, they have ever encroaching power in one direction.  Twenty five years now of people arguing that it should be trade agreement not political and yet reform has only been in one direction.  Now we are at the stage where an economic crisis is being used as a crisis of opportunity to push banking union.  It's the homogenisation of super-state and repeating failed history on a grander scale.   We've seen it all before.

&gt;...the kind of garbage you're bringing here is unfathomable.

- I mentioned that the EU had told people when they can and can't have an election, how is that unfathomable?

       ""But look at your response to them. What they're being told, 
        as their government is collapsing, is that it would be 
        inappropriate for them to have a general election. In fact
        Commissioner Rehn here said they had to agree their budget 
        first before they'd be allowed to have a general election.

        Just who the hell do you think you people are?""

http://www.policymic.com/articles/30251/cyprus-bank-crisis-money-is-frozen-shockwaves-felt-throughout-the-world

- I mentioned appointing administration, how is that unfathomable post the Monti appointment?  They couldn't have leaned heavier.  As Hannan pointed out EU commissioners were quick to rubberstamp Mario Monti, himself an ex-Commissioner and architect of the Euro, who then went on to appoint a completely unelected cabinet.

The Commission, or more exactly the federalists, have hijacked the term of what it means to be European.  It's either their way, their vision, of every greater political union, or it's ridicule.

They've even written papers on how 'populism' which they admit is now on the left, centre, and right, has to be suppressed and addressed, and how they are now equating it all with 'extremism'.   What they mean is they don't have popular support and so they're redefining other visions for Europe and what it means to be, outside the geographic sense, as 'extremist'.

&gt; Swiss officials accuse the Germans of breaking Swiss laws on banking secrecy and of committing economic espionage. According to arrest warrants seen by Reuters, the Swiss prosecutor is seeking the arrest of three German tax inspectors on these charges. 

No shit.  

German law does not prohibit information obtained illegally from being entered into evidence.  

&gt; Buying stolen data is an ""emergency remedy"", a spokesman for Germany's federal finance ministry told Reuters: It was justified because Germany and Switzerland did not have a deal through which Germany could enforce its tax claims. 

Germany, like the rest of Europe, does not understand the difference between ""Steuerbetrug"" and ""Steuerhinterziehung"" in Swiss law.  Switzerland has legal assistance treaties with almost every other developed country - but only for actions which are also criminal in Switzerland.

The reason why this is not the case for ""Steuerhinterziehung"", which is a misdemeanor in CH, is that it would legally be equivalent to letting Iran tell Germany to prosecute an Iranian national for blasphemy committed on German soil.

When Swiss banks go abroad and help citizens of foreign countries break their countries laws _in those countries_, that's a totally different story, and they can DIAF for all I care.

_Edit: It is important to understand that Swiss banks actually have very strict controls to ensure money deposited from abroad (I think the threshold amount is either 50k or 100k CHF right now) is obtained legally.  You are required to prove that it's not stolen, from drugs, etc. - obviously, with the whole Steuerbetrug/-hinterziehung thing, if it's money that you simply did not pay your taxes on, that is not considered a crime _in Switzerland_ as countries generally don't enforce other countries' laws if these are not their own laws as well._

&gt; Tax inspectors in North Rhine-Westphalia say they don't solicit data stealing.

This is bullshit.  Several large Swiss banks have launched major data protection projects as a result of systematic German communications regarding offering prizes for stolen data.  Going rate about two years ago was ca. 5 million euros, tax free, per DVD, after spot checks of names had verified their accuracy.  In early 2013, a senior German finance ministry official was quoted as saying that they were no longer actively pursuing this, as the Swiss had basically caught on.

Jesus. If you ask any Europhile, they will most certainly tell you that there is a lot of wrong with the EU. Inefficienty, lack of accountability, lack of powers the Parliament has, Commission President being unelected and so on and on.

&gt;The United States of America has far more accountability mechanisms and is more democratic than the EU

Because it is a federal republic? 

&gt;What evidence makes you federalists think that there's something special about Brussels or the people in it that will mean that won't happen here?

Wait. Are you actually using political corruption to be against federalism in the EU? Why don't you use the same argument to destroy the nation-state? Doesn't corruption happen in every capital? Then, why don't we destroy all governments, then? They are corrupt, aren't they?

true,sir_wolfie,EURO,Union européenne,"&gt;lack of prosecutions in the MEP expenses scandal  

You didn't answer this and just ranted. The UK had prosecutions, and reform, the EU did not. Nation state democracy 1, EU 0.  

&gt;Ahh. Another one. No one ignored referendum results.  

Everyone concedes Lisbon is the Constitutional treaty rebranded, even the authors. Hence the French and Dutch objections hold. To say nothing of the referendums promised, and those not held, and those not held on the euro. Virtually none of the powers the EU holds today were democratically acquired. Every europhile troll goes for a legal argument here and not the democratic one. Many dictators acquire power through some legal emergency clause or whatever, it doesn't make what they do later democratically legitimate, I hope you appreciate the distinction.  

And yes I know about the EU's special blog, but given how often ""Euromyths"" turn out to be true it's just a federalist propaganda office. Adding social media trolls to propagandise for federalism, from my taxes, is just an outrage. And it undermines your position too. You could be one for all we know, are they going to declare affiliations and in all cases?, it just mixes a large poisonous dose of dishonesty into an already decrepit and dishonest system. The EU propaganda budget is vast in other areas too, and equally a disgrace. If you can't even sustain the argument yourself from the civil society federalist movements and have to use public money to win then it just shows how hollow and intellectually bankrupt you are.  

Regarding the parliamentary video affair, I'm done digging up sources in this thread, the BBC (no eurosceptics they) had to intervene and tell the EU parliament they'd be pulling out of the ""we provide video for all the media"" if such editorial directives were going to be pushed onto the filming in the parliament.  

&gt;Because there haven't been any [Critiques of the EU]  

It's funny you say there have been no real critiques of the EU from sceptics, and then go on to saying that Europhiles have made all the sceptic arguments when you don't even seem to be aware of them all. You are literally foaming at the mouth in your incoherence. Just in this thread we had SavannaJeff denying that there were any major problems with the CAP. Even some europhiles make some criticisms, it's usually only to get ""more europe"" they never actually fix things. They could fix the CAP without ""more europe"", but they just want more power.  

&gt;I thought the EU was a socialistic utopia, now it is quasi-crony capitalism utopia?  

I never said it was socialist, you are beating a straw man there. It has socialist elements though, and euronationalist ones and corporatist ones. It's a kind of technocratic fascism lite at the moment I suppose. Many of the people inside it are deluded that it has democratic legitimacy, or they are like SavannaJeff and occasionally say they could imagine a referendum, but then rationalise all the ways not to have one. It must be internally distressing for some people to admit they are not democrats and thus they have to try and believe their own lies on the matter, it doesn't sound very convincing anyway.  

&gt;Wait. Are you actually using political corruption to be against federalism in the EU? Why don't you use the same argument to destroy the nation-state? Doesn't corruption happen in every capital? Then, why don't we destroy all governments, then? They are corrupt, aren't they?  

As I said elsewhere they are more accountable, the EU not only doesn't have the proper institutions, it can't democratically acquire them because it has no demos. And as the USA highlights having them isn't even a guarantee of getting great outcomes because you have to work hard on reform. The EU will not reform and will maintain the democratic deficit (or are you going to propose a federation in a referendum and then accept the result if you get a ""no""? haha, that'll be the day). All you are left with then is just blind trust in unaccountable administrators, a trust I do not share.  

&gt;You really are beating that straw man to death, aren't you?  

The fact the euro has been a disaster is somewhat relevant these days, especially if the same people are asking for more power. The argument that there is no demos and no accountability and therefore no democracy in the EU will be beaten not like a straw man, because it's true, it will therefore be beaten like war drum as we pull down your horrible institutions. Just look at your defence of the special tax rates in Brussels. That's all I need to know about you and your kind. One rule for us and one for the plebs. A complete and utter filthy disgrace.

true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"&gt;By my own argument? Nonsense. I wrote about the Church. You're going on about the city. You seem to make up your own stuff to argue against. 

The arguments you made about the church could just as easily apply to the city of Istanbul itself.

&gt;... more made up nonsense.

By 1453 the Byzantine Empire, and especially Constantinople, was in ruins. The 1204 sack delivered to it a blow that it would never recover from and can very well be construed as being the reason for the Empire's fall. The city's population went from almost a million people during the 10th century to barely fifty thousand  and the Hagia Sophia itself was in total disrepair, a telltale sign of the Empire's decline. After conquering the city, the Ottomans not only renovated the Hagia Sophia but managed to turn Constantinople into a burstling metropolis again. 

&gt;Are you completely stupid?

There was the possibility that the Hagia Sophia might have been destroyed during the sack. Would you have prefered it run into the ground instead of being turned into a mosque?

&gt;They gutted it. They only left the walls. And then they tried to pass it off as a mosque. gutted =/= ""intact"". 

Was the Pantheon in Rome gutted as well? 

&gt;Why? 

Why not? It's a historical monument, it would serve much better as a museum than a church. 

&gt;Sancta Sophia was designed by illustrious physicist and mathematician specifically to be a church. It was then built to be a church. And it was finally inaugurated as a fucking church to then be used as a church. 

So? Things change, deal with it.

&gt;I guess that this must then make it ... a mosque ... or a museum!

It's whatever the Turks want it to be. I prefer it as a museum because of its historical background.

I would want there some kind of fraternity that all Europeans share, but I just do not think it is there yet. Part of this has to do with language difference, but a big part I think is simply that all European countries have a historical and cultural awareness that is unique to there own country in particular. How desirable it might be to change these things, it cannot be forced. Or rather, they *can* be forced, but historicly, common identities have mostly been forged though bloodshed, which nobody really wants. 
The only way I see a common European identity emerging, if everything keeps going the way it goes now, is through gradual evolution.

- Switzerland is clearly the odd man out here.  The Swiss differentiation between ""Betrug"" and ""Hinterziehung"" (which doesn't even really translate in English...""fraud"" and...er...""cheating""?) is an extremely subtle legal definition that most (all?) other European countries don't recognize.  Not even Swiss data privacy laws are viewed as applicable to EU nationals who're considered by their home countries (the US as well) to have violated their countries' laws - they simply don't care whether it was on Swiss soil or not.  We can argue for years about whether Swiss tax avoidance or data protection laws are legitimate or not, but as far as the Germans are concerned, they did nothing wrong.
- Switzerland is tiny and powerless.  And because of all the _seriously_ fucked up shit our banks did with holocaust money, trading with evil dictators, and going into foreign countries and helping people commit tax fraud, there is absolutely zero moral authority, even if there were any legal authority.

To the latter point, it's one of the reasons the pro-EU people in CH like to give for why we should join, although it's pretty clear that (a) EU law would simply trump Swiss law on such issues and (b) small countries in the EU don't have a very good history of making themselves heard when Germany and France want to do things their way...

Gin Tonic, e vacci piano col tonic.

edito ed espando: il Gin Tonic è uno dei cocktail più semplici del mondo, motivo per cui è sempre il primo cocktail che prendo in un locale che non conosco. Se sei in grado di sbagliare un gin tonic, passerò la sere a ordinare solo quello visto che qualcosa di più complesso lo sbaglieresti (magari un cuba libre, toh). Sentimenti contrastanti per chi ti lascia la bottiglietta di tonica; Idealmente preferirei che mi arrivasse il bicchiere e basta, ma se mi arriva il bicchiere già mixato e la bottiglietta va beh. Se mi porti il bicchiere di gin e la bottiglietta a parte evidentemente non sono in un locale che fa cocktail.

Escalation alcolica comunque è: Gin Tonic -&gt; Old Fashioned -&gt; Daiquiri (se è estate)/Rob Roy (se sono sicuro che non ci finisce dentro del johnny walker red label)(che comunque per i cocktail va bene valà)/Martini -&gt; Bloody Mary -&gt; Nanna",0,1385070358,null,0,1385104696,0,cdjyhgo,t3_1r5rdg,t1_cdjyhgo,t3_1r5rdg,null,1428562489,9,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,9

Evidemment aucun de ces journalistes n'a eu le bon sens de se demander pourquoi des extrémistes s'attaqueraient à des civils américains pris au hasard à Boston (ville-symbole de la Révolution Américaine, un événement sacré pour quasiment toutes les franges de l'ED américaine), a fortiori encore moins le jour de la commémoration de la bataille de Lexington.

Franchement je ne me souviens pas que l'extrême droite était la piste privilégiée, simplement vu la date [les journalistes avaient fait des rapprochements](http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2013/04/16/explosions-boston-reaction-enquete-_n_3090443.html) mais sans oublier la piste de l'islamisme par exemple vu que c'était aux US. C'est facile de dire qu'ils s'étaient trompés a posteriori mais c'est aussi leur job d'étudier les différentes hypothèses, surtout qu'à l'époque l'enquête avait duré longtemps, donc oui il faut faire attention à comment on présente ces suppositions mais je ne trouve pas que rappeler des faits passés pour tenter de donner du sens soit en soi une erreur journalistique.

&gt;No. I will never identify with something corrupt, like the EU. And all other moneymongering assholes.

These are not opinions about the topic at hand, 'do you identify with todays Europe' and about how 'european' people feel. Instead, these are erratic rants and conspiracy theories regarding the EU.

Je ne sais plus si j'ai des posts dans mon historique sur Reddit qui pourraient en attester, mais j'étais parvenu aux mêmes conclusions sur la quasi-impossibilité d'une implication de l'extrême droite américaine au cours de l'enquête et avant que la piste de lone wolves musulmans ne soit confirmée.

J'ai lu et entendu suffisamment d’extrémistes américains pour savoir que s'attaquer à des passants au hasard ne correspond ni à leurs méthodes (d'ailleurs je ne pense pas que l'ED américaine ait un seul attentat comparable à son actif) ni à leur idéologie. Les suprémacistes d'un côté et la frange potentiellement violente des ultra-libertariens de l'autre ont chacun des listes relativement longues, hiérarchisées et cohérentes (à défaut d'un terme plus adapté pour le dire) de cibles toutes désignées. 

Une foule de civils à majorité WASP dans un rassemblement apolitique dans une ville dont l'histoire est intimement liée à la sacro-sainte Révolution américaine ? Aucune chance. A la rigueur, un déséquilibré isolé se réclamant à tort de tel ou tel mouvement aurait pu le faire, mais ça aurait été hors de tout cadre, mouvement ou groupuscule.

Que la police examine toutes les pistes et que les journalistes rendent compte de l'état des investigations c'est une chose, mais le traitement médiatique où j'ai eu l'impression que des journalistes voulaient à tout prix y voir la patte de l'extrême droite en est une autre. 

Je trouve ça malsain de savoir que des deux côtés de l'Atlantique il y'ait des journalistes qui en sont pour ainsi dire à espérer que le terroriste sera un extrémiste de droite et non un islamiste (sur Reddit et d'autres plateformes de nombreux internautes l'avouaient ouvertement, d'ailleurs).

A source on the 85% would also be nice, as I have never encountered either of these figures before your reddit comment so they are mysterious to me and I'd like to know more. 

No problem - it's from the Audit Report: http://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/AR_2012.aspx 

Handy graphic, page 7.

&gt;But provisionally, even if we take them both to be true, the administration of 85% of funds, say in Bulgaria, is still money from a Swedish taxpayer being maladministered...&amp;c

To be honest, I understand the viewpoint - if you don't feel ""European"", it seems daft to be giving money to people who, while they may be poorer than you, are very much wealthier than sub-Saharan Africans, simply on some supposed shared identity you don't feel you share.

But there's something in pretty much every government budget that each of disagree with, whether it's generous welfare entitlements, foreign aid, civil service salaries, spending on government IT.. the list is endless, and if we were each allowed to strike off what we disagreed with, there would be nothing left at all. That would appeal to some, but not to most, and so we each put up with what we disagree with unless we can vote sufficient politicians of our own persuasion into power to change it. If the eurosceptics manage that in the UK, or wherever, they get to implement what they want, but not until then. And it would have to be at the national level, too, because that really still is where the power is to make such changes, and it's somewhere eurosceptics have not in fact done well, largely because people know that despite the complaints, the EU is a very minor add-on to the business of national affairs. The whole portion of the member states' budgets spent through the EU amounts to around 1% of their GDP, a bit more than foreign aid - the UK's net contribution to the EU is 0.65% of their budget, their foreign aid is 0.56%.",0,1385072519,null,0,false,0,cdjzgsu,t3_1r4ty5,t1_cdjzgsu,t1_cdjtuqq,null,1428562030,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The video you posted said 1/3rd don't feel European, so they are probably not subscribed in great numbers to the subreddit that calls its subscribers ""europhiles"" in the sidebar now are they? That's if they can speak English, or are younger.  

The case that this subreddit is bias is not proven, but given nobody ever obeys the reddiquette in the other subreddits why would this one be different? Or is it just like how there is corruption in other places but there isn't in Brussels because Europe?  

Regarding the rest of what you wrote, my, my, my aren't all you europhiles starting to get some thin skin. Trying to take someone's democracy without asking permission and then getting surprised when we give you an earful of abuse? You think we'd just hand it over happily? You scum have been working for decades to deny people votes on your plans, don't cry thin skin now. Actually you'll probably need more than even thick skin when it comes to the end, if you keep denying referendums, you're probably going to need some kevlar.  

All I see in your sneering at eurosceptics is fear. We are many times more passionate than you are, but it's not the raw emotional passion of the tribal xenophobe you try to paint it as, it's passion with a clear and defined intellectual program to defend democracy. What's your intellectual program? Didn't SavannaJeff write academic work on the CAP? Yet here he can't even muster anything but mumbling that he supports CAP reform in theory after I showed him what a titanic immoral failure that policy is. You pat each other on the back saying you are the good and true, and we sceptics are all totally misinformed, but actually I think deep down you have your doubts.

But I should point out that the programme you've linked to [was itself a British TV documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Monaghan_bombings#Yorkshire_Television_documentary), so there clearly was extensive coverage of the allegations in Britain at the time. Also, as far as I can see, this Panorama report has nothing to do with the bombings you're referring to. The soldiers talk about extrajudicial shootings of people in the IRA, and that is reprehensible, but it is not the same as random bombings targeted at civilians and passersby. According to the Irish government reports quoted on wikipedia, there is insufficient evidence to link British security services to those attacks:

&gt; A finding that members of the security forces in Northern Ireland could have been involved in the bombings is neither fanciful nor absurd, given the number of instances in which similar illegal activity has been proven.

&gt; However, the material assessed by the Inquiry is insufficient to suggest that senior members of the security forces in Northern Ireland were in any way involved in the bombings.

&gt; The loyalist groups who carried out the bombings in Dublin were capable of doing so without help from any section of the security forces in Northern Ireland, though this does not rule out the involvement of individual RUC, UDR or British Army members.

&gt; The Monaghan bombing bears all the hallmarks of a standard loyalist operation and required no assistance.

true,JonasY,null,null,"&gt; In the poll that you are referring to, 37% answered that they thought Ukraine should join the EU in 5 years. It was their opinion, not a realistic prediction. 21% thought Ukraine should join EU at a later time.

I was talking about the people's opinion regarding the 5 years and how unrealistic it is. It just shows that people in Ukraine have no clue what Ukraine needs to do to join the EU. The media is not providing them facts on what needs to be done, how long will it take, where will the money come from, or the fact that they won't be able to compete with Poland and Germany, so their Ukrainian companies will have a hard time surviving. Furthermore, EU does not provide concrete plans on how Ukraine can become a full member. You think people in Western Europe want a poor country of 47 million to join the EU, so that they could face a new and bigger wave of immigrants than Poland. EU should stop giving Ukrainians these false hopes, and talk about this **one-sided** treaty that they were about to sign, that basically opens the doors for massive imports of EU goods to Ukraine and stops Ukraine from joining the Russia's CU, while at the same time some of Ukraine's goods won't even be able to be exported to EU because they don't meet EU standards. EU will also impose quotas, so the benefits are minimal for Ukraine. Tell me, how does Ukraine benefit from it all? 

22 years ago, leaders of Ukrainian republic were saying to people that Moscow was leeching from Ukraine, that Ukraine will become a second France once they get independence. Look where Ukraine's economy is now in comparison with Russia.

The least Ukraine's media could do is to show what happened to Lithuania 10 years after it joined the EU. Our salaries are lower than in Russia. We pay twice as much than Russians for fuel. Heat and electricity is probably also substantially costlier. In Lithuania, you are a pensioner after 65 years of age. In Russia, 55 for females, 60 for males. More than 50% of young Lithuanians said they want to move to live elsewhere. And indeed, from 2004 to 2013 400k people moved to the west, this is the most active population. So, every year we lose 40k young people. Not to mention the fact that we had to close a Soviet nuclear power plant because of EU, and Ukraine has a number of those ... . All of this after 10 years of full membership with access to EU financial help with 3 million population? Again, the fact that the population thinks it will take 5 years to become a full member should tell you on how uninformed they are. Of course, they will look at Germany and its salaries and pensions and will choose to go west, but the reality is different, and Lithuania is a good example.

Ukraine is better off with Russia as their air, space, heavy machine industries are tightly linked even now. Not to mention the 17 million native Russian speakers concentrated in these industrial zones of Ukraine. Russia is planning to heavily invest in these areas as well as others, on top of selling gas much cheaper. But Russia needs guarantees that Ukraine won't belong to a competitor.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;The ECJ is the EU. It is European law that the Commission has written.

Well, no, that's not the case. The ECJ is not the EU, it exists primarily to ensure the EU's compliance with the Treaties the member states have created for it to operate under. The judgement in this case was given because privacy is a right found in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union - which is a treaty-level document agreed by the member states, not Commission legislation - and it was considered that the expressed aim of the Commission in publishing the data was not a necessary enough goal to allow the abrogation of the individual's right to privacy. So this is not the Commission deciding to be opaque.

On the contrary, the Commission has been seeking a legal route to re-publishing the data since the case, but it is bound by the Charter to observe the privacy of individuals:

&gt;In September 2012 and after an in-depth analysis and assessment in order to find the most appropriate way to reconcile the right to protection of personal data of the beneficiaries with the need for transparency, the Commission proposed new provisions on the matter.

The Proposal: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0551:FIN:en:PDF

It's again, now, up to the member states and the Parliament whether they accept that proposal - and, again, while most of the member states are OK with it, there are some holdouts who aren't, so it's likely nothing will happen until they are.

Strictly speaking, too, what happened was that the publication of the database was found to have an objective which was not sufficient to overcome the right to privacy of individuals. What the Commission has done in redrafting the law is to give a stronger objective, the reaching of which is considered a worthwhile enough goal to overcome the privacy issue. It's worth reading the comments of the Irish Presidency on the issue: http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/13/st06/st06640.en13.pdf

In the meantime, the data published by individual countries is not controlled by the Commission, but is published by the member states, and reflects whatever their national preference for transparency is:

&gt;Please note that the websites linked to are under the control of Member states of the European Union and are not under the control of the Commission services.

There tens of thousands of EU civil servants salaries to make up there. It even bolsters the sceptic case in a way, the only time there are no errors is when it's going into their own pockets directly.  

Otherwise with the rest there are loads of errors and those are not just administered by nations, I can't find the 85% figure even, much is administered by the EU.  

On top of this there have been people fired from the court of auditors before for whistleblowing, so even this report isn't solid but it shows a lot of ""error"" anyway.  

Thank you for recognising those who don't identify and want to spend their money elsewhere. I don't agree that every policy should necessarily be put to votes in some veto to nothingness model nightmare you propose. But big simple questions should be put forward. Do you want a common currency? Do you want to be in the EU? If citizens can't answer those, then we might as well call it a day on democracy.   

And I think that last point goes against your argument that the sceptics have to win a national majority. It's an issue that crosses party lines that should have been put to the people. Now to get it to the people we have to develop policies in every area and build up a party over more than twenty years to get a vote on it? Well it's so important that that has actually been done, but I think it's not as efficient as just giving people a referendum (and stating clearly that your goal is, not disguising it). I think it has much to do with the political class in Britain wanting jobs in the EU, big business and ""influence"". So it's simultaneously a sickness in the EU and in Britain, but I haven't claimed national democracy is perfect, only that it's better.

First, I can say that the Netherlands is just great for Social Sciences. Period.

UvAmsterdam is well respected, but by comparison, tends to attract those studying ""*The Effect of Trans-Gendered Adolescence on Underwater Basket-Weaving in Sub-Saharan Fishing Communities*"".

Leiden is like Utrecht but smaller and less famous. Maastricht is weird and focuses on Law, avoid it. Groningen is supposed to be some super college town up in the north. Never went there. I bet its rad. 

But, I can definitely recommend the Utrecht for Social Sciences, especially in the areas of Economics, Medieval Studies, Counter-Terrorism or International Relations/Law. As far as the city, it fucking rocked.

I am perhaps a bit of an exception, being half German and married to a Girl with two other European passports. I speak four languages (Dutch, English, French and German) and have lived in France and Germany the last five years.

I still say that I am Dutch when people ask me where I am from. ""Europe"" would not answer that question. They want to know where my accent comes from and, perhaps, take into account my background. In that sense I think it is idiotic to give ""European"" and ""Dutch"" the same status, especially within Europe. In China or even the US it would, of course, be different.

Before, when I still lived in France, I brandished the tricolore on Reddit out of a sense of solidarity as well as identification (in context). Now that I live in Germany again, I do not feel ready to wear the German or perhaps Bavarian flag. But I will, once I feel ready. Yet, I will always tell people I'm Dutch.

Why then, would you ask, do I identify as a European besides or even before Dutch. That is, I'd answer, because I feel the national identity is too constrained, too confined. I do not wish to define myself by my country. My family, perhaps. My country? No. Even though Dutch culture has left unescapable traces.

It is precisely because European is not a nationality that I like it. ~~Event better: it is still an inclusive notion, like ""American"" anyone can become it.~~ It is ill defined yet unescapable. Nobody can deny I am European. Least of all I.

So it's the EU court.  And the 'member states' aspect is part of the council.  So still EU.

It's the EU.

&gt;On the contrary, the Commission has been seeking a legal route to re-publishing the data since the case, but it is bound by the Charter to observe the privacy of individuals:

So it's bound by an EU sanctioned Charter.

Still EU.

And the privacy of individuals is being extended to corporate recipients of the public purse!

&gt;t's again, now, up to the member states and the Parliament whether they accept that proposal

The European Parliament.

STILL EU.

The very idea that you're arguing the European Court of Justice as not being an institution of the EU, enacting and ruling on EU legislation, is simply mind boggling in the Orwellian sense.

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x17bxf7_nicolas-demorand-une-liberte-fondamentale-a-ete-grievement-blessee-18-11_news

Tu peux voir que Demorand est en effet très prudent sur les motivations du tueur, mais ce discours sur ""la montée d'un cran supplémentaire du niveau de violence"" me fait affirmer que Demorand pense à l'extrême-droite.

Cela correspond tellement au discours typique de Libé sur ""la libération de la parole en France"", qui irait de pair avec une libération de la violence, que je ne pense pas qu'il s'agisse d'une simple coïncidence. 

Sans compter que, comme certains l'ont déjà mentionné sur ce thread, on peut faire un parallèle avec l'affaire Méric: pendant un ou deux jours, Libé a titré sur un point culminant de la montée de la haine en France, avant que ce qui a été présenté comme un assassinat politique se dégonfle et revienne à l'état de fait divers tragique. A mon avis, cela en dit long sur le logiciel politique de Libé et de son chef, qui, comme l'a dit plus haut *jeanralph*, ""craquent complètement dès qu'ils imaginent que la cinquième colonne montre le bout du nez"".

Demorand n'est toutefois pas idiot au point de faire une prédiction plus précise. D'autres n'ont pas eu cette pudeur: je pense ainsi à Caroline Fourest, qui a pris la peine d'écrire [une tribune dans le Huffingtion Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/caroline-fourest/tireur-isole_b_4300288.html).

Elle commence sa tribune avec quasiment les mêmes termes et précautions que Demorand:

&gt; Il faut attendre, bien sûr, d'en savoir plus sur le profil du tireur pour déterminer les contours exacts de sa folie. S'il s'agit d'un homme sorti de prison croyant régler des comptes, ou d'un tueur fou se prenant pour un justicier. Mais si l'émotion est grande, c'est que certains faits divers n'en sont pas, même lorsqu'ils sont l'œuvre d'un fou. En tout cas, elle permet d'aborder un climat qui laisse craindre ce genre de passages à l'acte. En raison notamment de l'incitation à la haine qui vise de plus en plus souvent les médias en général et des journalistes en particulier ; par haine du ""système"".

Mais là où Demorand s'est arrêté à des allusions voilées (pourtant pas si équivoques), Fourest continue en dénoncant franchement la montée du Front National. 

Demorand et Fourest ne sont pas des clones, mais je pense qu'ils ont tous les deux la même manière de voir les choses, Fourest ayant simplement été plus franche et au final plus exposée en orientant cette affaire vers ce qui s'est avéré une fausse piste.

Au-delà de ce petit exercice façon ""Dans la peau de Nicolas Demorand"", qui vaut ce qu'il vaut, c'est surtout le bon vieux principe selon lequel ""Quand on n'a qu'un marteau, tous les problèmes deviennent des clous"" qui me fait écrire ces lignes.

Demorand ne souhaitait évidemment pas que son journal se fasse attaquer, mais il espérait probablement que cette attaque s'avère être un clou facile à enfoncer, où il aurait juste fallu mettre en garde, comme d'habitude, contre la montée de l'extrême-droite et de la haine... si la fusillade avait été l'affaire d'un skinhead aux idées courtes.",0,1385079226,null,0,1385079429,0,cdk2dcj,t3_1r3m3c,t1_cdk2dcj,t1_cdjykc6,null,1428560675,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

They have to do dirty work to buy food and to have a place to sleep, to be able to meet basic needs, i.e. they are forced to. They accept very low pay and bad treatment due to the constant fear of losing the dirty work. There's a word for this: SLAVERY!

&gt;There are only 2 sane solutions to get people to do dirty work. Everyone knows that it has to be done. So we would share the dirty work. (Like we share house work. We do share house work, right?) OR: We pay someone to do it. Of course we would have to pay enough to make it lucrative. 
But if it would be more lucrative to clean toilets than to steal cars or to sell drugs to kids we all would have less problems...

For example where I live, everyone **has to** clean the hall once every x weeks. This could be extended to include the sidewalk in front of the house. People already do it in the winter times when cleaning off the snow, so why not clean it anyways. (Just an example,). I am very well aware that no one would clean toilets just because they **have to**, but if the job itself is worth the money for someone (which it of course has to be), someone will do it. And again: is it really so far of track to think that humans won't do menial jobs in the long run, but get replaced by machines? Again of course not in all fields, but certainly in a lot of them.

I am also not saying independent British media never reported on these issues. Robert Fisk for example has done great deal of reporting on Northern Ireland. But when it comes to Northern Ireland the BBC has never strayed far from the standard government line.

As I said before the fact that this story is shocking to a British reader while here in Ireland it is the proverbial bears shit in woods story shows that there was a fundamental failing on the part of the BBC. As the national broadcaster the BBC has a duty of care to the British people to keep them informed about the actions of the British military and government. That a independent Yorkshire Television station was producing a documentary on the topic of collusion while the BBC remained silent is damning condemnation of BBC and it's reporters who lacked the bravery to tackle these issues.

The Pamorama report and the documentary above are not directly connected they are however just two examples of many others of rampant British defense force collusion and morally questionable tactics. They are just two symptoms of a much larger problem. 

An extrajudicial shooting to me is a murder and execution and there is absolutely no evidence presented that the people murdered were in the PIRA. Some likely were but without evidence and a trial we only have of the word of the people doing the shooting. As the Pat Finucane murder has shown the British defense forces had no problem killing innocent civilians.

I also don't think you can compare the actions of the PIRA with what is meant to be the legitimate defense forces of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is meant to be a democracy based on the rule of law. I don't think it's wrong to expect more from legitimate military forces of the United Kingdom.

As for the Barron report you are quoting it was widely considered a white wash. Due mainly the the British governments refusal to release relevant documents to the investigation. An issue which the Irish government is threatening to bring the British Government to the European Court of Justice.

To quote another part of the report.

 &gt; As stated, there are grounds for suspecting that the bombers may have had assistance from members of the security 
 &gt; forces. …. Unless further information comes to hand, such involvement must remain a suspicion. It is not proven.

The point here is not whether proof can be found it likely can't. If it existed it would likely have been destroyed many years ago. Rather the point is that for years there has been plenty information on which to base a news investigation. If the average British person isn't aware of this story and the possibility of extensive systemic collusion that was likely going on in Northern Ireland and judging by the shock this story is creating they weren't then the BBC has failed to live up to it's responsibility to the British people. British People have right to know if this kind of thing was going on within the United Kingdom.

All that said the BBC must be given credit for this Panorama report.

&gt; Belle illustration inconsciente de l’idolâtrie médiatique qui a capturé depuis bien longtemps le cœur et le cerveau lobotomisé des militants pro-mariage et de leurs suiveurs sociaux bisexuels/gay friendly…

Une patte qui me rappelle la production littéraire en première année de fac de lettres, là où on pensait avoir tout compris au monde, et quand on portait des mots de plus de trois syllabes comme un étendard pour notre intelligence supérieure. Allez, j'en mets un autre extrait:

&gt; À bien y regarder, cette image encensée par un certain nombre d’adolescents attardés homosexuels – et il est vrai que ça compose le gros des troupes LGBT ! – donne pourtant toutes les preuves qu’elle est une mascarade, une image mensongère de l’Amour. 

Quelle puanteur. Je ne le connaissais pas, ce type, mais je ne l'aime pas. Il tourne en circuit fermé.

&gt; Il n’en fallait pas moins pour flatter le militantisme pro-mariage en manque d’arguments dans les débats sur le projet de loi, et pour satisfaire les provocations adolescentes dont la plupart des mass media raffolent, tout soucieux qu’ils sont de choquer-pour-choquer plus que de défendre un Amour réel (étant donné que l’Amour vrai, même entre un homme et une femme, ne s’afficherait surtout pas comme ça pour défendre une cause, aussi juste soit-elle).

J'arrive pas à décider si c'est drôle ou triste. Mais il faut quand même avouer que le top du top, c'est en fin de compte l'article de ce désagréable personnage :

**""Le Kissing lesbien contre le Happening marseillais de VITA ou l’imposture bobo bisexuelle""**

&gt;tu devras reconnaître qu'il-y-a un abîme entre ce concept gaullien et l'idée d'un axe Paris-Berlin-Moscou

Non. Le discours de MLP parle du fait qu'on ignore Moscou. Et que Moscou est indispensable à la stabilité du continent européen. C'est exactement la vision de De Gaulle.

Relis les phrases. Un tel axe est inéluctable parce qu'ignorer Moscou est source d'instabilité en Europe.

Au hasard, les derniers événements en Ukraine le montrent parfaitement.

On ne peut pas ignorer Moscou. On ne peut pas non plus l'éliminer. Il faudra donc une coopération. Sauf si tu proposes autre chose, mais là je n'ai rien.

Non-intervention au niveau militaire, et commerce de gaz, comme c'est déjà le cas entre Allemagne et Russie. 

Pourquoi devrait-on intervenir quand ~~l'OTAN~~ les États-Unis l'exigent et se priver du gaz russe ?

Pas de lier, de soumettre. Tu te souviens le caca nerveux que nous ont fait les US quand on a refusé d'aller en Iraq ? Ils n'aiment pas l'indépendance ces bougres. Et force est de constater que leur attitude a été particulièrement belliqueuse ces dernières années.

Il serait donc souhaitable de s'en éloigner sans pour autant s'isoler.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"Well, no, I haven't said the CJEU isn't an EU institution. I've just pointed out that what it rules on is whether EU legislation is in accordance with the Treaties negotiated by the member states.

In other words, it's deciding whether EU legislation is or is not acceptable to the original intent of the member states, and the powers they granted the EU in the latest treaty revision.

For those of us from countries with a written constitution, that's very similar to the job of a constitutional court like the Supreme Court - which, while it is a national institution, as the CJEU is an EU one, is called on to decide whether the government of the day is acting in accordance with the national constitution.

And in the case of the EU, that 'constitution' is the Treaties, which are the limits set on EU competence by the member states, which includes the rights in the Charter, which the member states require the EU to observe. In the case of the database, the ruling is one against the Commission for infringing on the rights the member states require it to observe.

Your other points:

&gt;So it's the EU court. And the 'member states' aspect is part of the council. So still EU.

Now that's Orweliian. The member states are the various sovereign nations. If you want to call them ""the EU"", then there's no point at which you can meaningfully discuss the EU at all.

&gt;So it's bound by an EU sanctioned Charter.

No, the Charter is not ""EU-sanctioned"", but sanctioned by the member states.

&gt;And the privacy of individuals is being extended to corporate recipients of the public purse!

Not by the EU, but by the member states, who are offering their own versions of the database the EU is currently not allowed to publish. If the Commission proposal is accepted, the EU will once again publish the database, with all the recipients, both individual and corporate.

&gt;It's again, now, up to the member states and the Parliament whether they accept that proposal
&gt;The European Parliament.
&gt;STILL EU.

I'm obviously not explaining this well enough, because you clearly have no idea what I meant there. The Council and the Parliament will be voting on a Commission proposal to once again allow publication of the FULL database.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;There's no error on revenue, which is ""just 28 payments"" coming in from the members. And the 0.0% I think you are looking at is just 10 billion on the internal admin, buildings, their own inflated salaries which would be quite simple to do as they have a special tax rate, the 200 million just on moving back and forth to Strasbourg all the time and things like that. There tens of thousands of EU civil servants salaries to make up there. It even bolsters the sceptic case in a way, the only time there are no errors is when it's going into their own pockets directly. 

First, there's a lot more to the EU's income than just ""28 payments""! Second, the EU administration spends money directly itself, and not just on salaries, which account for only half the 6%. If the Commission hires a graphic designer to make a graphic, that's public procurement of exactly the same type as a national government. It just happens to be better accounted for, that's all.

&gt;Otherwise with the rest there are loads of errors and those are not just administered by nations, I can't find the 85% figure even, much is administered by the EU.

I should have said 80% rather the 85%:

&gt;Shared management areas such as agricultural and regional policy represent 80% of EU spending. For many of the errors detected through the audit Member States’ authorities were in possession of information that should have allowed them to identify and correct the problem before claiming re-imbursement from the Commission. There is still potential to use financial management systems more effectively and to reduce the error rate. 

&gt;Thank you for recognising those who don't identify and want to spend their money elsewhere. I don't agree that every policy should necessarily be put to votes in some veto to nothingness model nightmare you propose. But big simple questions should be put forward. Do you want a common currency? Do you want to be in the EU? If citizens can't answer those, then we might as well call it a day on democracy. 

Well, that one is between citizens and their national governments. In Ireland, we get pretty regular votes on the EU treaties, and they've all gone through, even if Nice and Lisbon only on the second round. The UK will get a chance to vote on EU membership in the near future, and the last polls show a pretty equal balance for Yes and No.

&gt;And I think that last point goes against your argument that the sceptics have to win a national majority. It's an issue that crosses party lines that should have been put to the people. Now to get it to the people we have to develop policies in every area and build up a party over more than twenty years to get a vote on it? Well it's so important that that has actually been done, but I think it's not as efficient as just giving people a referendum (and stating clearly that your goal is, not disguising it). I think it has much to do with the political class in Britain wanting jobs in the EU, big business and ""influence"". So it's simultaneously a sickness in the EU and in Britain, but I haven't claimed national democracy is perfect, only that it's better.

Actually, I wasn't suggesting building up a political party around the idea - I was more thinking of a referendum. UKIP is doing well in the run-up to the EU Parliament elections, but they've never got anywhere on the national level. Building an out-of-EU party doesn't come off at a national level, though, because the issue really isn't that important to most people. Sure, they'll vote on it in the EUP elections, and maybe turn out in a referendum, but on a day-to-day basis, it's only a minority of people who are motivated by the issue. For most people, the EU is OK, or not OK, but they wouldn't bother to walk down the street to cast a vote on it either way.

As to the idea that UK politicians want ""jobs in the EU"" - come off it. The people who go to Europe are those that have disgraced themselves in national politics, like Mandelson, and they come back as soon as they can. National politics is still where it's at for the vast majority of politicians and aspiring politicians. There's a maximum of 1 guaranteed EU job per country, and that's in the gift of the national government anyway.

Business does want to stay in the EU, because it's very good for business Again, they like to moan about ""Brussels red tape"", but they like to moan about ""Whitehall red tape"" just as much, and they're well aware that leaving the EU will just transfer red tape from Brussels back to Whitehall.
