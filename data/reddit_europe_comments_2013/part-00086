Here is the site for Nuremberg: http://vgn.de

Deutsche Bahn has special tickets that allow you to go as far as you want on a single weekend day or within a given state for one day for a flat rate, they are called Wochenendticket and Bayernticket for example. You can't take InterCityExpress trains with these, though.

As a further note, you probably know that prosecutors are not elected in Italy, penal action is compulsory (meaning that they do not pick which cases to bring to court) and, crucially, Italy's justice system is [inquisitorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisitorial_system) rather than [adversarial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_system).

For instance, a bank may hold some mortgages as assets. It then may ""collatoralize"" the mortgage debts (i.e. collect them together into packages of varying risk), and trade these packages. These packages are *derivatives* of the original debt. Maybe too they can collatoralize these packages together to make further derivatives, I don't know. But the point is that the deregulation of financial markets means that banks can create all sorts of financial products that are derived from real assets, and this has obviously spiralled out of control. 

The main issue with these, I guess, is that if the original loans fail, then so does the derivative, and the second derivative, etc. producing a much faster and more serious crash than would be the case without derivatives.

Drosseln wir uns dann am Anfang des Monats selbst, weil wir den Backbone überlasten? Und erst wenn ein Drittel der User ihre Bandbreite verbrannt haben, kriegen die anderen die volle Datenrate?

Telefonieren geht doch auch über IP, warum drosseln sie nicht auch das? Nach 120 Minuten Schnack nur noch 5 Minuten pro Tag? (Back to the Akkustikkoppler, yeah wir machen IP über Telefon über IP!11!!)

Wie schafft es Googe, 1GBit/s ungedrosselt für den Preis eines DSL-Anschusses anzubieten, und du kriegst 10MBit/s überall auf der Welt ohne Drossel?

10GBit/s am DeCIX kosten AFAIK 2600 EUR/Monat. Das sind 1000 DSL-Anschlüsse a 10 MBit, a 50 Flocken, macht 47400 EUR Gewinn (ok, du musst das dann auch noch zum Kunden routen)

This is absolutely not true and it makes me sad that people actually believe this. There is a big percentage of Germans who sympathize with the Greek and other southern Europeans. I was on a huge demonstration yesterday in Berlin with tens of thousands of other people who protested against the powerful banks, the bad treatment of southern european countries and the bad treatment of the poorer people in general. There were countless political speeches in favor of treating all countries equal and for international solidarity. Again, it makes me sad that people from southern europe think the germans don't give a shit or even worse we would be happy to see others fail.

true,snaut,null,null,"Thank you but there was no blood on the kitchen knife. Actually I'm interested in this case to the point of reading the motivation reports, forensic reports, court transcripts and other documents that were made available.

If you go only by what the media says, you come out with factoids like ""knife with the victim's blood"".

The knife was tested for blood initially by the police technician. She made two tests. Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) test returned negative. Human species test returned negative.

Later the appellate judge ordered a retest, and court appointed experts did a cytological analysis, again finding no blood or any other human cells.

The knife tested positive for very low levels of victim's DNA when the police tested it. The DNA was no longer there when the experts tested it again.

What is the explanation? How is it possible to have DNA but no blood or other human cells? The lab tested the knife in a batch of 50-60 samples from the crime scene, most containing large amounts of victim's DNA. During PCR analysis DNA is replicated. Billions of copies are created and it's hard to avoid a low level of cross-contamination with artificially created short elements of DNA.

The DNA test result from the knife is of very low level. What it shows is just background contamination, probably not even what was on the knife, but what was in the PCR machine or on the reagents or lab tools used.

When the appellate judge rejected the kitchen knife he pointed out the lack of blood and the fact the knife wasn't coherent with the crime scene evidence. It was too large to match the wounds or the bloody imprint left by the real murder weapon.

And in this article, nothing is said about the Croatian victims of crimes committed when the self-declared Serb state in Krajina targeted in this military operation was created. A friend of mine and her family were among the many thousands who were expelled from Krajina overnight by the local Serbs in '91 when they created their local mini-state; their house was taken over by Serb neighbours and all their possessions burnt. Some others were less lucky and were just killed. By omitting the context of how this Serb mini-state was established in the first place, and why the Croatian state deemed to take it back in ""Operation Storm,"" it is as selective in telling the truth as it accused the Croatian state of being.

&gt;So far, no one has been held accountable for war crimes against the Serbs,

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) [prosecuted the top generals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Gotovina_et_al) in charge of Operation Storm, and in first instance convicted them for war crimes. However, they appealed and won their appeal, being exonerated of those war crimes. That ruling obviously won't have pleased the author, but that's different from there not having been accountability at all.

Moreover, in addition, [in Croatia itself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Storm#War_crimes), ""as of November 2012, Croatian authorities ""have convicted 2,380 persons for looting, arson, murders, war crimes and other illegal acts"" committed in the area during or after Operation Storm.

Leveraging is something that allows you to raise the stakes on a bet using the same starting amount.

* don't put parmesan cheese on pasta plates that contain fish or shellfish.  :D 

* don't ask for ""latte"", it's the italian word for ""milk"". The 3 main type of coffee are espresso, macchiato, marocchino. 

* We don't have starbucks, but we have the original shops called ""bar"" (hence the word ""barista""). 

* You won't find anywhere a coffee like in america (in a mug): the closest thing you can get is called ""americano"" in a bar and it's coffee with added water, but it's not percolated so the taste will be different. We don't drink coffee as it was tea, we drink espresso after the meals or in between during the day to get a jolt of energy. 

* Cappuccino is usually drunk during breakfast with sweets (like ""brioches"" or ""croissants"" in the northern part) or mid afternoon. 

* When we have time (like in the weekends, or everytime when you are a student) we do a break during mid afternoon. It's called ""merenda"" and it's something similar to the 5 o'clock tea time for the british. It's usually a light snack.

* please don't get wasted as Bread_heads said: there many stories of people from abroad getting drunk and damaging properties, artworks and even having sex in front of many people. It's easy to lose control of the alchool, because it's usually cheap compared to the other countries. If you like to drink, find a good company of people and drink at home: you will be safer and you can sleep on a couch until you sober up :)

Of all the Axis leaders, he's the only one to have died of old age even though in my book he's responsible for more deaths than Mussolini.

In that perspective, you can't really wonder why people that are 20 years old now and have lived next to his statue are influenced by his views. You couple that with the fact (and again, please contradict me if you know better), but the Trianon pact is still seen as that point in history where Hungary was screwed and that it should be revisited (100 years afterwards). Also, I keep hearing about how nice Romanians were being treated in Transylvania during the Hungarian (for lack of better word) occupation... As the article said, it's a problem with the education, but what I want to add is: education system.

Not sure that Hungarians are more racist than neighbouring peoples, but anti-semitism is definitively more open and marked here than anywhere else I've been. 

Fidesz's attitude to the far right seems to run hot and cold, arguably bolstering its agenda with the heated nationalist rhetorics of its own while repudiating it whenever they cause too much of a PR headache. To its credit, the government did intervene to ban the far-right's ""Give Gas!"" motorbike tour through the city on Holocaust memorial day, which was to pass through the Jewish neighbourhood and right by the synagogue, for example. (Yes, that was a thing.) 

The government's regulatory authorities seem to run hot and cold versus the far right too. On the one hand, one of the [very first fines](http://www.politics.hu/20110906/media-council-fines-tv-station-for-hate-speech/) imposed by the brand new media authority in 2011 was against the conservative station Echo TV, after presenter Ferenc Szaniszló of the ""World Panorama"" program had spoken of ""Gypsy terrorism"" and the ""Nazi liberals"" who encourage it and whose single goal is to ""inflict parasitic human-like figures on Hungarians"". That was found to violate laws on human dignity and hate speech. The authority also recently [launched an investigation](http://www.politics.hu/20130412/media-watchdog-investigates-orban-ally-for-article-comparing-roma-to-animals/) into a newspaper article by Zsolt Bayer, a rabble-rousing commentator and personal friend of Viktor Orban, in which he had written that ""Gypsies are animals and act as animals"" and that ""most Gypsies are unsuited for co-existence, for living among people … If they don’t get immediately what they want, they kill"". Don't know if they already came to a ruling.

On the other hand, the same authority has banned the liberal ATV station's news readers from calling the far right party Jobbik ""far right"" in its broadcasts, saying [it would fine the station](http://mediamonitor.ceu.hu/2013/03/media-council-warns-national-tv-station-against-describing-jobbik-as-far-right-party/) if it would continue doing so. Jobbik has actually been very active addressing complaints to the media authority about supposed violations of a controversial ""balanced coverage"" requirement for broadcast media in the new media laws, and the media authority [usually rules in favour](http://mediamonitor.ceu.hu/2013/02/decisions-on-balanced-reporting-the-media-council-upholds-a-majority-of-jobbik-complaints/) of the far right party. And of course, the above-mentioned Ferenc Szaniszló was later [awarded](http://mediamonitor.ceu.hu/2013/03/journalists-protest-state-award-for-far-right-tv-presenter/) a prestigious journalism prize by the government, and then [un-awarded](http://mediamonitor.ceu.hu/2013/03/far-right-reporter-agrees-to-return-states-top-journalism-award/) the prize among somewhat hard to believe claims that the government minister hadn't been aware of his offensive past writings.

In general, a cynic would argue that it is in the government party's strategic interest to keep the far right fairly strong, but too strong. That's a tricky path to steer though, of course.

&gt;It was Victor Orban, who inspired the right-wing extremists to go onto the streets in 2006/2007. 

No, that's not true. Orban called on his supporters to take to the streets in protest, after then-Socialist Prime Minister Gyurcsany was caught admitting on tape to have been ""lying morning noon and night"". And they came in their tens and even hundreds of thousands. But those rallies were held in the day time and attracted a very different audience than the far right protests which turned into riots every night at the time. You might blame Orban for not having spoken up unequivocally enough about those riots, but he certainly did not call them on the street and he did not call for violence - the far right was well capable enough to do those things themselves.

Das ist kein Argument. Wenn eine beträchtliche Anzahl der Kunden mehr Traffic verbrauchen würde, wäre es nur gerecht, dass diese auch mehr bezahlen. Ich bin mit dir einer Meinung, dass das momentane Gebärden der Telekom faktisch nicht zu rechtfertigen ist. Aber aus Gründen der Fairness sollte man nicht argumentieren, dass die Masse für die (noch) Minderheit zahlen sollte, ohne dafür eine Gegenleistung zu bekommen.

Ich kann gut verstehen, dass die Telekom mehr Geld möchte. Sie wollen aus dem Preiskampf ausbrechen, im Licht des steigenden Bandbreitenbedarfs gut verständlich. Dass sie gleichzeitig riesige Gewinne machen mal außen vor. Aber wenn sie Geld für den Netzausbau brauchen, und das nur durch höheren Umsatz bekommen können, warum erhöhen sie dann nicht einfach die Preise, gestaffelt nach Bandbreite. Wenn jemand 100Mbit bestellt, würde ich davon ausgehen, dass er davon mehr erwartet, als jemand der 16Mbit bestellt. Dann kostet seine Flatrate eben dementsprechend mehr. Wäre allemal besser als dieser halbgare Drosselungsquatsch mit Verletzung der Netzneutralität inklusive. Alles vorausgesetzt, sie stecken das Geld dann auch in den Netzausbau.

From the US perspective, Europeans constantly say ""we´re your partners, we´re your partners, we´re your partners"" while simultaneously giving up the means to be a strong partner. If European publics have no interest in NATO they should be electing anti-NATO politicians. But as it stands, most NATO member governments want to stay in NATO but don´t want to have to pay for it.

I think the US policy should be that unless European countries raise their military budgets to a certain level, the US will cut NATO funding accordingly.

A few remarks though. Horthy is an arguably more ambiguous figure than Mussolini, because he was an appeaser rather than supporter of fascism, and while his alliance with Hitler involved strict anti-Jewish laws and eventually selling out the Jews in the countryside, he intervened to protect the Jews of Budapest from deportation and certain death. He was also overthrown by actual fascists in the last year of the war, and is reported to have allowed tentative government feelers to Britain to change sides in the period before that.

But yes, definitively deeply worrying that Horthy statues and street names are going up now. He remains an authoritarian ruler whose reign was marked by virulent anti-semitism from the start, back in the early 1920s.

I didn't deny that part. But it's only scare tactics and demagogy... meaning, in our day and age of lousy privacy, you can quickly put together a list of Jewish PMs... But it wins him some votes and creates yet another hate headline... Which will then get a response from the Jewish NGOs, the US and the EU, which in turn will ""prove"" the people's paranoia that ""the Jews are out to get us"". Fear-mongering is easy.

&gt;Jews supposedly being out to ""colonize"" the country also reflects anti-semitic tropes of long record.

This scared me in the article as well. Do people actually think that? Do they think the only real estate developers and investors in general are Israelis or Jewish in hidding? It's scary and it comes from this whole: ""our fascism was different"" mentality... We can talk a lot about Horthy, but since he massacred innocent Romanians and Jews, you won't get me to see much of his good side. Of course, most leaders are complex. Even Hitler wasn't all bad, he had dogs... The main difference between Horthy and Mussolini, is that the latter was hated by his own people by the end. Hungarians never got there and by slowly chipping away at history, you'll get to all-round for the guy in a few generations.

Those who heard of these experiences developed a hatered towards the people that opressed their ""countrymen"" (for lack of a better expression).

To take Romania for instance, they only have two targets for nationalist hatered: the Hungarians and the Russians (or Ukrainans?) The Slovaks only have the Hungarians to focus on.

&gt;  Demand everywhere is falling because of austerity. If Greece couldn't produce enough things of value before the crisis, what makes you think it's so much more plausible now that everyone has stopped spending?

&gt;
&gt;I'm saying that the motives for the Hungarian anti-semites are exactly the same as the movites of Romanian nationalists, except that in the case of Romanians, there aren't many Jews around so they bash Hungarians.

To put this in perspective though, there are only a little over 100,000 Jews left in Hungary. That's 1% of the population. It's not quite what they call ""anti-semitism without Jews,"" but it's not far off either. The other minorities you mention make up a five to ten times larger share of the population. That's part of what makes the rampancy of anti-semitism here so striking. (And please, I hope that for once nobody will come up with the pablum about how that 1% is a supremely powerful clique that controls the country's economy, finances and politics).

Your argument also raises the question of whether familiarity breeds or counters resentment. It seems to simply extrapolate that the larger a minority, the bigger the enmity, but the example of anti-semitism already shows this is not the case. And without wanting to venture into all too much anecdotalism, I see a mixed record around me. The loathing for Arabs and Muslims you see in much of Western Europe is mostly absent here because, well, there's not many of them around, so people just don't particularly care. On the other hand, compared to how I've seen the few black people here being ogled, mistrusted and treated, they're much more accepted and treated as equal in Western Europe, probably because they're just still quite exotic and alien here whereas they're commonplace there. So it can apparently go either way really; the dynamics involved are more complex than that.

&gt;No one gives a shit about Hungarian bashing, since they don't have a strong/economically powerful state to stand behind them. 

The reason anti-semitism is considered such a particular taboo in most of Europe is not because it is policed by powerful Israeli financiers. It's because people were educated about how the Holocaust was an unparalleled, unprecedented enormity of industrially executed genocidal hatred which resulted in 6 million people being killed purely because of their ethnic/religious identity. Nothing else - none of the war crimes committed against Serbs, Hungarians, Croats, French, etc, remotely compares. And *that's* why it's considered a big deal when anti-semitism nakedly rears its head again. 

Dismissing such particular sensitivity as something that must just be resulting from financial pressure from Israel is .. well, it fits in unnervingly with the anti-semitic tropes being highlighted in the first place. I mean, what? Of course we wouldn't spontaneously be offended *in particular* by the resurgence of a phenomenon that led to the biggest genocide in European history, less than a century ago - when we pay special attention to it, it must just be that we're bowing our heads to devious and all-powerful ~~Jewish~~ Israeli interests?

The fact that 6 million Jews were murdered is a horrible thing but personally for me, the fact that members of my family were murdered by Serb ""partisans"" and that this crime is denied even today feels much more painful than a statistic you're throwing around here. 

When I said that the Holocaust is remembered because there is a powerful state behind them I didn't mean Israel, I meant the US, Germany, Israel, and many other countries which, for one reason or another, support the rememberance of this event through various means, for example through exhibitions, TV shows, books etc. It's good that they're doing this, for example one of the comic books that affected me the most in my life is Art Spiegelman's book about his father. The fact is that he was able to create this beautiful and horrific work of art because he was financed by cultural centers that had the interest to finance works that dealt with the Holocaust. Works of art shape public conscience, the public forces the government to educate their children more about the Holocaust, and then you have what you mentioned, that people in Western Europe are aware of the crimes because they were lectured about them in school.

A month ago a book was published called ""Slaughter in Bezdan"" ([here's a link, but it's in Hungarian](http://keskenyut.hu/page/234/art/783/akt/1/html/a-bezdani-verengzes-1944.html)), which dealt with the mass murder committed against the Hungarians by the partisans in 1945. The book was financed through money collected through donations by the local community. They didn't get any support from Guggenheim, or Simon Wisenthal, or any embassies. The book was published in only 500 copies and I know about it only because I have relatives that died in that massacre. It will also likely never get translated to any other language. Public conscience will never change regarding the Hungarians in that region, the children will continue to learn that Hungarians were evil bloodthirsty fascists and they deserved everything that happened to them.

Note the quotes at the bottom from Olli Rehn and the other from Lord Lamont. The 90% figure is from the erroneous paper. 

Rogoff, one of the authors of the erroneous paper, [used to work at the IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/np/bio/eng/kr.htm) and frankly the IMF would be neglecting to do it's job if it didn't pay attention to such a major paper. That's not to say there were not other reasons for austerity; there have been other studies which broadly back up the gist of Rogoff and Reinhart, in fact their main idea that high debt inhibits growth is broadly borne out even in the corrections. Debt does inhibit growth but by only a little bit. You can still get 1 or 2 percentage points of growth with 90%-100% debt but it's lower than the growth you will get at 60-90% which is lower than at 30-60% which is lower still than &lt;30%. &lt;30% debt is the best place to be. What the IMF may have avoided had they know the errors is advising aggressive austerity with very high debt countries like Greece. They had more leeway than they though and they could have combined cuts in spending and reduction in debts with some investment and achieved better results.

No other community does this, be it Ukrainians, Jews, Saxons, Turks, Tatars, Serbs, Bulgarians etc., which is probably why there is no animosity towards any of them, even though we had political feuds with most throughout history.

I agree with you and I think what they did in Germany by reducing the working hours instead of laying people off en masse was a very good thing.

Unfortunately, Spain's problems are both fiscal and structural, with limited policies available for each. On the one hand, [direct and indirect taxes have already gone up](http://www.advoco.es/hot-topics/102-spanish-income-tax-rates.html) in order to try and manage the budget deficit, so it would be very hard to sell a lower minimum wage or reduced wages.

You might be surprised that the austerity in Greece has resulted now in a gutting of the private sector rather than the public sector. The most cuttings in the public sector were wage cuts.

&gt;The private sector, on the other hand, will benefit from lower public expenditures and lower taxation, wages will tend to go up and not down.

The current situation disproves that idea.

&gt;And the rest of the world devalues (or tries to devalue) its currency while the Germans let it appreciate.

If they weren't fetishizing on ""no inflation"" that would be less of a problem.

* Hungary, Finland, Russia: *""What would your opinion be if your university mate was a member of the following groups?""*

This was a question asked to students in Hungary, Finland and Russia in research published in 2010. Table 2 [in the publication](https://54fda2a9-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/jrspone/content/JSRP-Nr2_MURANYI/JSRPNr.2_MURANYI.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cp910mzA3cANF4QG7PQPqcCYavrepGTgM1mZAHiy4TcTEvlAKVl9RfNjcSTVgIKOSDsGwcgt2JqE-_5CqAx4zY5fLRkvWeMbBXpbI5Z0QxQ2lx5Tu8G6cBUEsgUKqOjXVgYE1YqZBLus629SJ00opj7w3Hwn51oD-SBxrcFXFXj1qSzymaYzVWD57lv-ndZM6ms2FvT29jhbp7UQ_NiTPvIQq1fJ2D-FjqGxjqNy6KgP3viMq0aSSifD_HJYQPQUJ3cz6fK&amp;attredirects=0) shows the percentage of students answering that they ""would be disturbed"" if their student peer were to be [fill in ethnicity]. Those percentages are generally reassuringly low. The exception is that 30% of Hungarian students would be disturbed by a Gypsy fellow student, but otherwise the percentages for all listed ethnic groups among both Hungarian and Finnish students stand at 12% or less. Hungarians would be most disturbed by a fellow Romanian (11%), Chinese (9%), Slovak (9%), Jewish (8%) or Serbian (7%) student; Finnish students by a Gypsy (12%) or Arabic (7%) student, but just 5% or less of them would be disturbed by any other group.

The survey also asked a battery of questions about ethnic and minority groups - see table 6 and 7. Should ""the rights of certain ethnic groups in our country .. be limited""? Are ""all means .. acceptable to protect the interests of one’s own ethnic group""? Are ""marriages of people belonging to different ethnic groups .. not acceptable because they result in the degeneration of the nation""? Is ""true friendship .. possible only with the people from the same ethnic group""? In all three countries, these statements were generally disagreed with. Most so in Finland, though (mean score: 7, where 0 means totally disagree and 100 means totally agree) - more than in Hungary (22) and Russia (29).

* Slovakia: *Would you want to have a Jew as a neighbor*?

This perhaps makes for an interesting international comparison, though of course differences of methodology always make direct comparisons between results in different studies tricky. Slovaks were apparently asked this question as part of different surveys in 1990 and 2008, [this paper reports](http://www.blogs.uni-mainz.de/fb02-international-relations/files/2012/10/BustikovaGuasti2012-1.pdf). Back in 1990, 34% did not want to have a Jew as a neighbor, which seems comparable to Tarki's result for Hungary in 2012. However, anti-semitism has apparently been falling significantly since then in Slovakia. In 2012, just 12.5% of Slovaks said they would not want to have a Jew as a neighbor. The percentage saying the same about a prospective Roma (Gypsy) neighbour dropped from more than three-quarters to 47%. So the 2012 numbers regarding both Jews and Roma are much lower than in TARKI's Hungarian research. 

Interestingly, whereas the 1990 result predictably showed the largest social distance towards Jews among supporters of the Slovak National Party and the Christian-Democrats (and least among Greens and Communists), by 2008 the highest social distance towards Jews was measured among the main Hungarian minority party, the SMK.

* In Hungary, the trend may be in the other direction. 

Political Capitol's [2010 publication](http://www.riskandforecast.com/useruploads/files/derex_study.pdf) on *Demand for Right-Wing Extremism* used data from the biannual European Social Survey and grouped measures on how the survey's respondents answered five questions about immigration and one about gays and lesbians into a category dubbed ""prejudice and welfare chauvinism"". Reviewing results from Czech Republic, Croatia, Greece, Latvia, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine, it concluded that Hungary had the third-highest level of ""prejudice and welfare chauvinism"", after Latvia and Turkey, and remarked that:

&gt;Hungarians’ predisposition to far-right ideas has been on an uninterrupted rise since 2003. Growth in prejudice – especially anti-foreigner sentiment – has been a major contributor, shooting up from 37 percent of respondents in 2003 to 55 percent in 2007

The ""number of potential rightwing extremists more than doubled from 10 percent in 2003 to 21 percent in 2009,"" it remarked, expounding on the international comparison:

&gt;A comparison of Poland and Hungary may make for depressing reading for Hungarians. The two countries started at about the same base in 2003: 10 percent of Hungarians and 9 percent of Poles were potential supporters of the extreme right. By 2009, Poland’s DEREX score had dropped by nearly a third and Hungary’s had doubled.

An [update from 2013](http://www.riskandforecast.com/useruploads/files/derex_ess5_english_update_20130211.pdf) based on the latest round of the European Social Survey, and reflecting data from 26 countries, notes that prejudice has been markedly rising in the West and South in the past two years too, but that East-European countries remain most expressive of prejudiced opinions.

&gt; Dude, it's mainstream economics, read something about monetary policy and it will tell you that, it's quite simple macroeconomics. In the page I sent you it even says that ""mainstream economists agree that the quantity theory holds true in the long run"".

And how do they prove it holds true in the long run?

&gt; There, I corrected it a bit, 

You did not correct it, you just made stuff up. 

Most economics make assumptions about perfect information, that's why the thing you quoted said ""all-knowing"". Why the hell did you cross it out?

Actors of the market as a model cannot influence the rules by which the market works, when in reality they can influence legislation. That was the point of ""exert no control"". Why did you cross it out? Are you aware of any model in which the players can influence the rules of the game?

Same goes for your other corrections. Look, if we're going to have this discussion, we need to be honest with each other; you can't just pull stuff out of your ass. 

&gt; the perfect competition model is just a model, just because it actually doesn't exist in real life, you can't just say ""these are abstract models, there's imperfect competition so in real life it's actually the opposite"".

A model that makes assumptions that blatantly violate real life is a flawed model. I understand that the model need not be a one-to-one simulation of reality. But you can't make assumptions that are the opposite what's true and draw conclusions. I agree with you that when invalidating the models does not mean that the opposite conclusion is the correct one. But neither I nor the article ever made such a claim. 

&gt; Well, all those things you mentioned have real negative impacts. I wouldn't argue against taxes as those are needed to keep public services working and against environmental regulations as that prevents externalisation of costs but all the others do harm the economy and countries with the least of that are countries where the people live better off.

Just repeating a claim does not make it true. The article gives specific reasons why this is not the case that you do not address at all. There is a second criticism that is not mentioned in the article: people took the Lucas-Sargent model, changed the assumptions slightly and arrived at a completely opposite result: expansionary fiscal policy increases employment, national income  and aggregate investment while leaving prices unchanged ([chapter 8 of this book](http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415619295/)). This is why you should not blindly trust theoretical models like that. 

Also, I'd like to see some evidence of ""countries with the least of that are countries where the people live better off"". Do you have a study? Even a crappy correlation one would be fine.

&gt; Plenty of people predicted it, the Austrian school of economics kept on arguing against the low interest rates and it seems they were right.

That's not how predicting works. Did they have a model that predicted the specific effects of the crisis? Or did they generally argue against low interest rate waiting for any catastrophe to ""prove them right""? Because from the way you present it, it sounds more like preachers who attribute earthquakes to excessive sin than scientists making predictions. 

&gt; Price controls lead to shortages. Same thing with rent controls.

Again, making a claim does not prove it. It's not true just because you say it is. 

&gt; Subsidies to those with low incomes were never condemned by neoclassical economists [...]

I've seen plenty of right-wing people being against all these things citing economic ""proofs"" that they can't work. If neoclassical economists do not want their stuff to be used to promote this sort of agenda, they should be more vocal about it. 

&gt; Well, government doesn't counteract unemployment, people counteract unemployment. It's all about the labour market and how government interferes with it. 

So, the government can counteract unemployment by interfering with the labour market. I'm not sure I get your point here. 

&gt; Besides, creating employment is easy, you could for example ban all agricultural hardware, suddenly there would be an huge demand for farmers and we'd go back to living like we did some centuries ago where the vast majority of the people lived off the land. That however, would be retarded, the goal isn't employment but rather the outcome of it.

This is a huge strawman and you know it. Who the hell did you see promoting stupid ideas like that that you felt the need to reject them?

&gt; Yeah, ""inequality"", like Thatcher would say, these people would rather have the poor poorer provided the rich were less rich.

The mere mention of the term ""inequality"" just makes you start a rant about how ""these evil leftists want everyone to be poorer"". Sigh. What you have here is in no way a retort. It's a rant.

&gt; And pretty much all monopolies are a consequence of government action. You tell me a monopoly that has on being a monopoly without any kind of government intervention.

I don't disagree. But at the same time I don't see how it could ever be prevented within the capitalist system. At the same time, governments that are bought off by monopolists are powerless to break up these monopolies.  

&gt; And the remarkable thing is that, from the marxist point of view, the economic pie is best when there's no inequality and everybody is miserably poor. I just wonder why it was the East Germans flooding Western Germany and not the opposite.

That's a strawman and you know it. I don't see why as a leftist I'm supposed to say how East Germany had it good. By that logic I would have to hold your ideology accountable for every anti-communist dictatorship Greece ever had. 

&gt; Fucking bullshit. Nobody is for inequality, what people are is for no enforcement of equality. That's like saying ""oh, you don't support affirmative action? Then you're a racist"".

Well, if a capitalists starts his life by owning vast amounts of resources and some poor guy starts by being in debt, I don't see how we must stand aside and let things take their course. If you just do nothing in a situation like this, you are implicitly allowing inequality to breed. 

&gt; Except, well, massive youth unemployment in countries with high minimum wages such as Greece and Spain and very low youth unemployment in countries without such measures such as Germany and Finland.

Let's see a study confirming that correlation first. Also, Germany does wage dumping; what's the point of having low unemployment if people can't afford to buy food?

&gt; Again, fucking bullshit, the blame was in first the Federal reserve keeping interest rates too low leading to a bubble and then massively reducing the money supply leading when it burst creating massive deflation.

&gt; So yes, the blame with the sticky-wages but not with the workers, it was with the governmental authorities, how were people supposed to know at the time that the amount of dollars in the economy had shrunk by 1/3? Prices are sticky, it's impossible for the market to converge like that and just like that reduce all prices and wages and everything by 1/3. Anyway, the blame for all this crap was with the central authorities which caused the whole thing.

You are correct that someone pointing out that sticky wages cause a problem is not the same as blaming workers. I don't think I agree with your theory about the origins of the crisis, but it's up to debate. 

&gt; ""HURR DURR, THE RICH WANT TO EXPLOIT THE POOR""

It's the conclusion of the book, you can't just make fun of it in vacuum. Also, it's true: the rich are exploiting the poor. 

&gt; Yeah, fucking economists who earn as much as teachers, they're just so evil and so rich that they want to oppress with their theories which are proven right both by their models and by empirical observation of the impacts of government intervention in the economy specially in countries where this is more prevalent.

Allow me to disagree. My personal experience in interacting with it, has shown me that economics is hardly a science and a lot of people in academia share this belief. Economics has consistently failed to predict much, the theories all have crazy assumptions and there is no consensus on anything in the field. Nevertheless, their crazy theories are used to set policy in the real world and those policies are overwhelmingly about cutting benefits and welfare and deregulating everything.

&gt; Yeah, you should want that for Greece, rise of the proletariat and all that, it always worked out fine in the past!

I would want it. Striving to improve things is human nature. I don't see why past failed experiments should stop people from trying again. Scientists never stop trying to achieve things even after failing hundreds of times; I don't see why societies should.

Non a caso in Giappone per ピザ (*piza*) si intende la pizza all'americana, la *pizza pie*, mentre la VERA pizza si chiama ピッツァ (*pittsa*) e costa UN BOTTO DI SOLDI, generalmente più di ￥1000.

* La frutta. Beninteso, alcuni frutti erano comunque economici (banane, mandarini e frutti esotici in generale), ma orograficamente il territorio giapponese non è granché per l'agricoltura, e si vede. [Questi meloni](http://youtu.be/FdxJy2QcTjM?t=6m52s) sono un esempio, ma senza esagerare così tanto anche [questi](http://i.imgur.com/7MnjEzq.jpg) mi fanno accapponare la pelle (sarà perché qui dove abito è una zona di produzione massiccia di melone e angurie, quindi i prezzi sono bassissimi). Per non parlare delle mele, una volta non ho resistito e ne ho comprata una a 600￥, l'ho sbucciata e dopo la prima fetta tutto il resto della mela era già marroncino ed emanava un odore non proprio sano.

In compenso, mi manca [questo gelato](http://i.imgur.com/NhZeA4h.jpg) (vaniglia e pezzettini di Oreo, se conoscete qualcosa di simile in Italia vi prego di dirmela) e il mitico, l'unico, l'inimitabile [ramen di Ichiran](http://i.imgur.com/XjytwKf.jpg) totalmente personalizzabile.

In Greece where the ""moscow backed"" communist party survives to this day, it will sound like heresy.

In other countries that had different influences and back stories even a hardcore antifa leftist might be like ""communism? too much millitarism, it led to dicatorships, not fail safe, bad economical and societal historical record, overall a potentially dangerous version of what we believe in""

Not saying that those groups necessarily have different ideas, it's more like things being conflated due to tradition or sth. Imo despite being in Greece I think at this point what is being reffered to as communism is the kind of thing we saw in USSR with all its failings, from what I've seen from history I'd rather call communism a dictatorship that uses egalitarian excuses, than be like ""the USSR was not true communism. In fact it was Capitalism. Especially Stalin, he was the worst, therefore also the most capitalist"" You quickly get into logical rudeness and non falsifiable theories like that (if you assume that communism is itself the egalitarian ideology and for any regime that claimed to be communism but failed you just pick the fact that its failure led to inequality and claim it's capitalism, like, wtf)

Obviously, the money is intended for banks so that these banks can give cheap loans to businesses that face difficulties.

The problem here is, that businesses interested in a loan need collaterals to be eligible for such a loan at all. In tough times, where businesses already face bankruptcy, collaterals are hard to find. The assets are already being used for other loans.

So, most businesses who want and need such a loan simply can't get one - no matter the cost for this money.

Japan applied this low-interest policy in their biggest crisis in the 1990s. In the early 2000s Japan reported that only 1 Yen out of 6 Yen actually reached the economy. The reason: the crisis-struck businesses had no collaterals left to get a loan. The rest remained at the banks which in turn got free money to play with - such as investments in land, housing and so on.

So, the Japanese created an instrument with an efficiency factor of 1/6 or 17%.

In 2002, the American Federal Reserve did the exact same thing which led, among other problems, to the American housing bubble that preceded this European crisis. And American businesses went broke nonetheless which rendered this tool of low-interest money useless for a second time within a short period.

Giving away free money also didn't work for the US economy but instead, miraculously, the European market crashed only a few years after that.

So, I wonder where this free European money, that definitely won't reach the struggling businesses this time, will go to next.

&gt; giving the money straight to the unemployed

I'm thinking this would strongly depend on a country by country basis. In some country's unemployment benefits are already sky high compared to others.

This will also cause a lot of fuzz. Anyone from Northern/Western Europe already heard some ""lazy greek""  BS at least once since the crisis. Imagine it when their money goes to the unemployed. Certain countries in Eastern Europe were/are giving money to those countries in need but in the mean time their own people still had lower average purchasing power. This also caused a lot of unrest. Imagine it when they'r giving money to people who already have higher unemployment benefits then they have?

idk I see how it could help but I don't see it happening without causing a shitstorm.

Yes, if it is to save the Greeks, or for Eurobonds, since it against the rulse. 

&gt; ECB's mandate to maintain financial stability in the Eurozone.

ECB has price stability above that. 

&gt;Because sometimes the rules are crap.

Fine, I think the rules about not torture are crap, just as our fine is towards the EU. We can ignore them to then? You just can ignore the law as you please, not only is it illegal, but it creates chaos, and is extremely disprespectful and countries/people who keep on doing that are shitting on everyone else. If one doesn't like the rules, one goes the *legal* ways to change them. How can you defend illegal ways? I see nothing wrong with not liking the rules and wanting to change them - it happens everywhere, all the time. I honestly do not understand how one can disprespect the democracy and the law so much that they think it is OK to ignore it, when they decide it doesn¨t suit them. That means that you consider yourself, or your ilk, above the law - you don't have to go through the same as everyone else. It sets an extremely bad prescedent (which the countries who didn't care about the stability pact has already proven, they are part of the reason the economy is so shitty) and creates distrust, chaos and is non democratic.




&gt;Sure, if it gives better results. Making a mistake is bad, but refusing to correct it is worse.

Refusing to respect democracy is even worse, it can *never* lead to anything good. 

So, why not negotiate a new treaty. I am all for that, besides then I get a chance to vote about it. Refusing 



It is extremely disrespectful towards the people who have voted about the Maastricht treaty, not to follow it. If you want to respect the people, let them vote about a new treaty then. 

&gt;They are being renegotiated, by democratically appointed representatives. A national bank doesn't put up every big decision they make up for a national vote eithe

No, they are not. To renegotiate the Maastricht treaty, you need all 26 countries, and several (if not all) of them will have to vote about it, in the parlament or popular votes. It will take decades.

I know my country would vote no (as several others, probably yours too) and I haven't heard one breath about a new Maastrich treaty. In fact, I have read (and they have been posted here, you have probably read them too) several articles on just how much the politicians do *not* want us, the people, to vote. Obviously, since, not very surprisingly, a lot of us would vote no to a new treaty. So, in fact, we are not getting a chance, but above all, the politicians are far to scared of the people to put it to vote.

And, above all - the ECB are *civil servants*. They do not have the right to change the rules - only a change of the Maastricht can do that. I honestly can not believe that you think it is OK for civil servants to disobey the law. If that is the case, a judge can ignore the law too if he doesn't like it, or an accountant can move money to his pleasure. *Until* the treaty is changed, the ECB has no right to do disobey.

Well you need to spend more time around the elderly. There's an old phrase in English that I can't quite remember well enough, but it's words to the extent of a parent care's about the next 15 years, a grandparent cares about the next 50, or something. Older people are usually very clear sighted and focus on sustainability of an idea more so than quick-fix career politicians. That's one of the whole reasons behind the British House of Lords [that and they couldn't be bought because the 'bribing threshold' was totally beyond the reach of the commoners in the 17th century]; the experience of years isn't ignored or forgotten in the short-sighted zeitgeist and fashions of the young, and I think you'll find that institutional memory is regarded in high esteem around the world.

I agree with cbfw86 that politics could do with more wisdom, and like s/he says, wisdom doesn't come any other way than through age.

And under French tutelage they formed the ""Little Entente"" against a possible Hungarian revanche. In the light of this it was somewhat natural that Hungary allied first with Fascist Italy then Nazi Germany in hopes of a revision of its borders. As the balance of power shifted, Hungary was given back some territories first from Slovakia (after the first dissolution of Czechoslovakia, after Munich), then Romania (which was also a German ally, and Germany arbitrated the relocation of the border), that were mostly majority Hungarian or at least had significant Hungarian population at that time. At the end of WWII the borders drawn at Versailles (Trianon) after WWI were restored in the Paris peace treaties.

&gt;No, I said they are demanding that an autonomous region should be established, just like we already have for the Catalans in Spain, the Austrians in Italy... 

The situation in Romania is quite different. Granting autonomy would require a referendum to change the constitution, specifically these two articles:

Articolul 2, Paragraful 1: ""Nici un grup si nici o persoană nu pot exercita suveranitatea in nume propriu."" 

(No group or person may exercise sovereignty in its own name.)

Articolul 4, Paragraful 2: "" Romania este patria comuna si indivizibila a tuturor cetătenilor săi, fără deosebire de rasă, de nationalitate, de origine etnică, de limbă, de religie, de sex, de opinie, de apartenentă politică, de avere sau de origine socială. ""

(Romania is the common and indivisible homeland of all its citizens irrespective of race, nationality, ethnic origin, language, religion, sex, opinion, political adherence, wealth or social origin.)

Besides reforming the constitution, any project with the aim to create an autonomous Hungarian county would also need to redraw the administrative map of the Mures county which has an even population of both Hungarians and Romanians.

As you can see, granting autonomy to the Hungarian minority is not as simple as it may seem and it's highly unlikely the Romanian people would vote for changing the constitution giving their inherent distrust of politics and association of autonomy with outright independence. The Hungarian Civic Party, which is at the forefront of the autonomy movement, is also not helping giving their involvement with Jobbik. 

In the end though, the Hungarian minority is very well protected under the law and they are in every way equal to the Romanian majority. Granting autonomy to them might happen in the future but right now there is literally no reason to rush it just because a bunch of extremists are upset.

It's just not on the radar at all over here, and neither is anti-antisemitism, despite us being a neighboring country. Then again, there are only a few thousand Jews left - most WW2 survivors emigrated to Israel.

Still, I think the faults of Jewish politicians and representatives there are mistakenly reflected onto the general populace. The same is true for Hungarians in Romania. Especially in Transylvania, we do realize that the vast, vast majority of Hungarians are hard-working people who care more about their jobs and their day-to-day issues than they do about territorial ones. It's a bit worse in the South - RMDSZ politicians are the only Hungarians most people over there have ever heard or seen, and they believe the rest are just like them. In turn, the country-wide anti-Hungarian public discourse even makes some people here wonder whether the friendly Hungarian lady at the market stand indoctrinates her kids at home, telling them that Romanians are evil. I know there are extremists on both sides, but I feel that many politicians and community leaders stir things up instead of looking for the right solutions.

To be frank, if one of the aforementioned ethnic communities wanted more local autonomy, I wouldn't have anything against it. I would go there to visit and enjoy having a traditional dinner in their midst, take a picture with their flag, leave with a smile and be proud this can happen in Romania.

What many people don't know/forget is that Trianon wasn't so much a reflection of the post WW1 situation, as it was a reflection of the post Romanian-Hungarian War of 1919 situation. Given that at the end of that war the Romanian army was in Budapest and that in the pre WW1 agreements Romania was promised by the Entente pretty much all the territory east of the Tisza the Trianon treaty was in that sense a concession made by the Romanian government at the time due to huge pressure from Paris and Washington.

Truth is Trianon wasn't so much about the politics, as it was about the situation on the ground and even if the Romanian government was forced to give up the territory up to the Tizsa, they were certainly not going to give up anything past the Satu Mare - Oradea - Arad line.

true,scarcecrow,HUNG,Hungary,"A little historical background, quoted from an earlier comment of mine:


&gt;Between 1939-41 about 18 000 Jews were deported to the Ukranian front line for forced labour. (The Hungarian public wasn't really informed about this.) Most of them was killed by the SS, a few thousand fled back to Hungary.

&gt;Between 1942-44, the new prime minister, Michael Kállay, tried to resist the German pressure, rejected their demand to deport Jews and even tried to bring home the already deported people, with little success.

&gt;Finally the Germans had enough and in March 1944 they occuppied Hungary. Almost half million people were sent to Auschwitz whithin few months. The ruling Arrow Cross party never had a popular support in Hungary and their government was the puppet of the Germans.


That half million people was deported and butchered **after** the nazis removed Horthy from power - the Gestapo kidnapped his son wrapped in a carpet and blackmailed Horthy to step down. His older son (both of them were very popular and *hated the nazis*) died in a plane crash in 1942, some say it was also the nazis' work. The Horthy family was finally freed from captivity by US troops.


The Horthy statues in Hungary are not erected by the state, but some local politicians/groups. They think that Horthy was a strong leader, who did some nasty things only to choose the 'smaller evil', to protect the majority of people and because he had limited room for maneuvering. In their eyes, if Horthy had choosen the open confrontation with the Reich, Hungary would have shared the fate of Poland, with much higher casualties. (Knowing what happened after Horthy was forced to step down, it's probably true.) Surrounded by hostile nations and being on the losing side in WW1, nobody would've shed a tear. Their opinion is that he was a smart politician who tried to mitigate the consequences of the rise of the Nazi Germany, made the country stronger and saved many lives - with some sacrifices.


Personally I disagree, I believe he traded human rights for territorial gains and gambled taking serious risks. And we paid for his mistakes with 4 decades of bloody commie dictatorship. But I can understand those who think differently.  

Horthy himself stated that he never was antisemitic and did not know about what the nazis did with the Jews in the concentration camps. Others saying it's not true.


So that's why he is controversial. The schoolbooks differ from each other a bit, depending on the opinion of the authors, but every student learns about the white terror of Horthy's militias in the aftermath of WW1 and the Jew laws and all that stuff.

You don't solve the problem of religion by tightening up laws on clothing. You educate people, teach them to think critically and eventually they'll see that their silly superstitious traditions are a huge waste of time, and possibly dangerous. Oppressing people by telling them what they can or can't wear ... That's the religious position, why should secularists adopt it?

*As for political opinions such as buttons or campaigning clothing, that is unprofessional, and shouldn't be allowed while on the clock. Freedom of expression is always tricky as to where to draw boundaries, but I think some article of religious expression being worn its understood that that's a personal choice, whereas its a lot easier to see a boss ordering their employees to wear items that may express  political opinions, or some other such uncomfortable situation, or be interpreted as an official endorsement of a politician/ideology.

if you got your aufenthaltstitel and your arbeitserlaubnis you can start working. 


best way for you is 1. choose a city.
2. find places where you would want to work --- email them your resume.

Alle Leute die sich auskennen sagen, das Traffic für die Telekom quasi kostenlos ist. Irgend eine Nachkomma-Stelle in deinen 50€ für DSL jeden Monat. Zudem liegt ab deinen DSLAM an der Ecke Glasfaser. Da ist viel Luft. Sehr viel Luft noch oben. Die Infrastruktur ist teuer. Zudem verkauft die Telekom eine Flatrate. Ich sehe nicht wie es unfair ist ein Angebot auch zu nutzen. Bei LTE mag es technisch bedingt anders sein, aber die grenzen dort halte ich auch für vorgeschoben um Leute die keine andere Wahl haben in die teuren Tarife zu drängen solange es noch geht. 

Und ich hätte sogar nicht mal ein Problem mit einen Angebot der Telekom mit Marktüblichen Traffic-Preisen. Bei Hetzner z.B. kostet das Terabyte zusätzlich 6,90€. Selbst wenn die Telekom hier 15€ nimmt, wäre das noch in Ordnung, wenn sie es klar kommunizieren. Zudem ist die Drossel auf 384kbit/s ein de-fakto Abschalten des Accounts für die meisten Anwendungsfälle. 

&gt; Was mir momentan fehlt, ist eine faktische Begründung für die Drosselung. Warum geben sie nicht einfach mal ein paar Zahlen für die Netzauslastung raus. Kann doch nicht so schwer sein...

Laut [dem DLF Hintergrund](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/1df792/schnelles_internet_ausgebremst_von_drosselpl%C3%A4nen/) hat genau das sogar die Enquete-Kommision des Bundestags versucht. Ohne Erfolg!

Perhaps it's that Germans were always known to be Germans, Slovaks were always known to be Slovaks, while Jews, in fear of earlier religious persecution, often preferred to take Hungarian names, hide their origin and mingle with the rest of the population. The same happened in pre-WW2 Romania. When someone does that one starts to wonder what they have to hide (or makes up theories on Zionism), and in turn isolates and persecutes them for what had initially started off as a way to avoid persecution. But the entire Jewish discussion is a bit out of my league, so colour me uninformed.

As for Hungarian politicians over here, there are some who've probably gained many fans in the far-right crowd in Hungary - like Tőkés László. He is the man who lit the fuse for the Romanian revolution of 1989, which could have transformed him into a longstanding folk hero, and somehow he still manages to be one of the most hated figures in public discourse because of his extremism. Conversely, there are plenty of Hungarian athletes, actors and other public figures whose ethnicity is recognized, but simply not an issue when it comes to the respect we have towards them.

Romanians, just like anyone else, prefer being sweet talked and reassured to having their hands twisted.

What I found turned out to be too much for one comment, so here goes for a Part 1 and Part 2 comment...

**In the 1990s and early 2000s, it seemed, anti-semitism in Hungary was no worse or better than in surrounding countries.**

An article [based on data from 1995](http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/16Kovacs.html) concluded that ""29% of the Hungarian adult population is non-antisemitic, 25% antisemitic, and 32% accept some of the economic stereotypes formed over the centuries about the Jews without these stereotypes being accompanied by any particular antisemitic feeling"". In that survey, ""just"" 15% of Hungarians would not accept a Jew as a neighbour. But 41% agreed rather than disagreed that ""when doing business with a Jew, one cannot be too careful"". 

That data does not seem to have involved a cross-national comparison, but the article recapped previous research by others as well, which sometimes did. A survey from 1991, for example, included questions such as whether group X/Y/Z (including Jews) had ""too much influence, too little influence, or the right amount of influence in our society"" (17% said too much), and whether the respondent would like to have Jewish neighbors, not to have any Jewish neighbors, or wouldn’t care either way. On that question, 17% of Hungarians preferred not to have Jewish neighbours, which sounds like a lot until you compare it with the 40% of Poles who said the same. In general, that study suggested that ""about 10–17% of the Hungarian population [was] inclined to agree with expressly antisemitic statements,"" which ""was perhaps slightly stronger .. than among the Czechs, but weaker than in Slovakia, and considerably weaker than in Poland and in Austria"".

A later survey from 1995-1996 again showed that ""antisemitic prejudice [was] strongest among the Poles and the Austrians and weaker among the Czechs and the Hungarians,"" with anywhere between 10% and 55% of Hungarian respondents giving antisemitic answers, and an ""extremist antisemitic core"" of 10-20% of respondents. The one question where Hungarians came out more anti-semitic than the other countries was about whether ""Jews have too much influence in our country"" (18% strongly agreed and 21% somewhat agreed). According to yet another study from the early 90s, ""about 7% of Hungary’s population could be considered as extremely antisemitic, while about 50 % was non-antisemitic, and 40 % possessed some form of anti-Jewish prejudice"".

An article based on 2002 survey data from TARKI [concluded that](http://www.tarki.hu/adatbank-h/kutjel/pdf/a737.pdf) ""the general level of political and discriminatory antisemitism has neither risen, nor declined .. since 1994,"" while the level of religious antisemitism had dropped. It also concluded that ""openly discriminatory anti-Roma opinions became less frequent during the last decade,"" even though ""attitudes towards the Roma remain[ed] essentially negative"" - very strongly so in comparison with attitudes toward other ethnic groups. In addition ""over the past five years the proportion of the adult population characterized by an openly xenophobic attitude has varied between 26 and 43 per cent."" The article did not have an international component.

**That was then. What about now?**

[This 24-page article](http://www.jsantisemitism.org/articles/4-2/Kovacs(2).pdf) by Andras Kovacs echoes the Political Capital research I described in my other comment, which showed a stark rise in prejudice between 2003 and 2009, though this article puts the surge at a somewhat later date:

&gt;[D]uring the first decade and a half after the fall of communism, 10%-15% of the Hungarian adult population held strong antisemitic prejudice. Anti-Jewish sentiment was reactive to political campaigns: antisemitism increased in election years and then fell back to its previous level. This trend altered after 2006, and the surveys indicate an increase in prejudice since 2009. [..] The results of our investigations show not only an increase in the absolute percentage of antisemites, but also an increase in the proportion of antisemites who embed their antisemitism in the political context and who would be inclined, under certain circumstances, to support antisemitic discrimination. This phenomenon is linked with the appearance on the political scene of Jobbik, a more or less openly antisemitic party.

The author argues that, rather than just reflecting prejudice, the strength of the far right Jobbik party reinforces and engenders it, making it worse and more political. The article is based on new research such as a 2009 survey on attitudes toward the Holocaust and a detailed 2011 survey designed to repeat questions asked earlier in 1995, 2002, and 2006 so as to best track change. Figure 1 shows the percentage of those who expressed they felt ""antipathy for Jews,"" and the analysis observes that:

&gt;between 1993 and 2006 the share of those who emotionally reject Jews varied between 10 and 15 percent. After 2006, this percentage increased significantly to 28 percent of the adult population in
2010 and to 24 percent in 2011. The graph also shows that the percentage of those who emotionally reject Jews jumped around the time of national elections (held in Hungary in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010).

Answers to the question ""Do you like the [group] living in Hungary?"" also showed acceptance of Jews (and Germans) dropping after 2009, even as acceptance of other groups stayed level and the image of the Roma actually slightly improved. 

Beliefs illustrating ""political antisemitism"" reached new highs in 2011: 35% believed that ""Jewish intellectuals control the press and cultural sphere"" and 34% believed that ""there exists a secret Jewish network determining political and economic affairs"". So did one of the two queried ""discriminative antisemitic"" views: 19% now believed that ""in certain areas of employment, the number of Jews should be limited"". Religious anti-semitic views, such as that ""the suffering of the Jewish people was God’s punishment"", on the other hand, were shown waning or stable.",0,1367514972,null,0,false,0,c9r3adq,t3_1djgfq,t1_c9r3adq,t1_c9qx9pr,null,1431348002,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,almodozo,null,null,"Again, no international comparison though. [This article from last year](http://www.jsantisemitism.org/articles/4-2/Kreko(3).pdf) by Peter Kreko has comparative data, however. It used data on the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia from something called the European Values Study 2008-2009 survey database. This database includes answers to the question ""On this list are various groups of people. Could you please tell me any that you would not, generally speaking, like to have as neighbors?"", wherein Jews are one of the possible groups being asked about. If you're wondering why the neighbours question keeps coming up in all this research, it's apparently a standard measure from the ""Bogardus social distance scale"". But the article's author warns about the question's limitations: it ""can capture only the most extreme, most openly antisemite respondents, whose ratio is pretty low in the overall population"" and is mostly only able to measure ""the discriminative component of antisemitic prejudice"" rather than the political or religious types. 

Table 2 shows how many respondents answered they would not accept Jews, Roma or people from other races as neighbours. The percentages saying so are much lower than in the TARKI research, and regarding Jews even lower than the numbers from the 1991 and 1995 surveys. I don't know why, maybe the exact wording of the question makes a big difference. Just 6% of Hungarians would reject Jews as neighbours, according to this source, while 9% would reject people from other races, in general, and 39% would reject Roma as neighbours. This would make Hungarians relatively tolerant compared to Czechs, Poles and Slovaks. According to the same data sample, 18% of Poles would reject Jews as neighbours; 22% of Czechs would reject people from other races; and 57% of Czechs would reject Roma as neighbours.

The author devotes a lengthy footnote to these numbers:

&gt;The fact that the level of antisemitism is the lowest in Hungary compared to other countries in the region deserves more attention, as studies from the past few years indicate that general xenophobia is higher in Hungary that in any other countries of the CEE region (see, for example, a calculation based on the European Social Survey database in Kreko, Juhasz, &amp; Molnar, 2011). This specific finding, however, is completely consonant with the findings of the comparative studies in the nineties [which reflected] a relatively high level of political antisemitism but a relatively low level of religious and discriminative antisemitism in Hungary compared to other countries in the region.

The footnote as well as another footnote proceed to caution, however, that ""it is important to mention that [Jobbik's] first real political success [..] happened in June 2009, after this survey was conducted"" and ""the appearance of Jobbik [..] raised significantly the level of visible antisemites in Hungary"".

**In short**

The Kovacs article and Political Capital piece suggest that intolerance and antisemitism have significantly increased in Hungary since the mid-00s - even, as other sources suggest, as antisemitism is on the wane in countries like Poland and Slovakia. Antisemitism and intolerance are fairly widespread in Hungary, although the contrast between the Kreko and TARKI data, as well as some of the divergences between the data from the 1990s, illustrates that exact numbers are very hard to pin down and a lot probably depends on wording and methodology. Comparisons with other countries also seem tricky. It's clear that back in the 1990s, Hungary didn't stand out and actually seemed less intolerant/anti-semitic than its peer Central European countries, and the Kreko article suggests that this may not actually have changed as late as 2008-2009. I couldn't find more recent data on international comparisons beyond Political Capitol's broader, findings about intolerance toward immigrants, which are unflattering for Hungary in comparison. Judging not just on those findings, but especially the Kovacs article too, the trendlines in Hungary this last couple of years in any case are very negative.

I still got nuthin' on that research that included a fictional ethnicity that was promptly rejected by the Hungarian respondents, though. Must be out somewhere still.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;You seem to have just skimmed through the article and quoted random things to reply to with one-sentence handwaving. Not good. 

You expected me to quote everything and write long rebuttals? You must be insane.

&gt;And how do they prove it holds true in the long run?

Because of economic theory (money is neutral, increases in the money supply only lead to nominal changes in variables such as prices, wages and interest rates) and empirical data (the larger the expansion of the money supply, the greater the inflation, and with the opposite it's the same thing).

&gt;Most economics make assumptions about perfect information, that's why the thing you quoted said ""all-knowing"". Why the hell did you cross it out?

Because in real life there's no perfect information and nobody claims there is.

&gt;Actors of the market as a model cannot influence the rules by which the market works, when in reality they can influence legislation. That was the point of ""exert no control"". Why did you cross it out? Are you aware of any model in which the players can influence the rules of the game?

No, but I'm aware of plenty models where the actors exert control such as monopolistic and oligopolistic competition.

&gt;A model that makes assumptions that blatantly violate real life is a flawed model.

You make up a model that accurately describes real life then without any simplifications. You'll do more than what any economist has ever done, you'll certainly win a nobel prize and will revolutionise social sciences forever, making them more accurate and precise. If you can pull it off, though, considering how impossible that is, good luck.

&gt;But you can't make assumptions that are the opposite what's true and draw conclusions.

What should be done then? ""IRL there's asymmetrical information so we can't draw any conclusions whatsoever""?

With that argument, you must also fully reject other stuff like statistics or weather forecasting, these also aren't exact sciences.

&gt;expansionary fiscal policy increases employment, national income and aggregate investment while leaving prices unchanged 

Of course prices would be unchanged with fiscal policy, inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.

As for the usage of fiscal policy to increase employment, income and investment, well, the debt has to be paid, it's not a free lunch, you either tax more (and therefore nullify those effects) or borrow (and delay the costs into the future).

&gt;I'd like to see some evidence of ""countries with the least of that are countries where the people live better off"".

[Index of Economic Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom)

&gt;Did they have a model that predicted the specific effects of the crisis? Or did they generally argue against low interest rate waiting for any catastrophe to ""prove them right""?

They argued about the malinvestments and the artificially low interest rates leading to a bubble that would end up with a bust when it proved unsustainable. Some argued specifically against the housing bubble and they were right both in the cause and in the consequences of the 2008 crisis.

&gt;Again, making a claim does not prove it. It's not true just because you say it is. 

Of course not, it's true because of the economic theory behind it and the empirical data that supports it.

&gt;I've seen plenty of right-wing people being against all these things citing economic ""proofs"" that they can't work. If neoclassical economists do not want their stuff to be used to promote this sort of agenda, they should be more vocal about it. 

Same thing with nowadays socialists and the dictators that have spawned under socialist regimes.

&gt;So, the government can counteract unemployment by interfering with the labour market. I'm not sure I get your point here. 

No, government can counteract unemployment by stepping out of the labour market.

&gt;This is a huge strawman and you know it. Who the hell did you see promoting stupid ideas like that that you felt the need to reject them?

It's the same thing, between trade barriers and banning technology, both achieve the same result of lower unemployment and higher poverty.

&gt;Well, if a capitalists starts his life by owning vast amounts of resources and some poor guy starts by being in debt, I don't see how we must stand aside and let things take their course.

And if a capitalist starts rich and mismanages his money, he'll become poor whereas some poor guy that works hard may very well die a wealthy and happy man so that his children can be spoiled brats that don't value what they own.

&gt;If you just do nothing in a situation like this, you are implicitly allowing inequality to breed. 

It's still a fairer system than real life where, for example, some people are born with great eyesight, others needing glasses and other blind.

The solution, however, isn't to bring everybody down to the same playing field, it's not by making the rich poor or those who see well blind that society will be better off.

&gt;Let's see a study confirming that correlation first.

You can compare the [minimum wages](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/1/15/MW_map_EUR_January_2013.png) (as a percentage when compared to the average wage) and [youth unemployment](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/8/8b/Youth_unemployment%2C_2012Q4_%28%25%29.png).

Alternatively, you may watch [this short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DS0XXFdyfI) by Walter Williams.

&gt;You are correct that someone pointing out that sticky wages cause a problem is not the same as blaming workers. I don't think I agree with your theory about the origins of the crisis, but it's up to debate. 

You don't agree with anything that mainstream economists say, you prefer your dogma of Marxism, so don't say it's up to debate, that's like a fundamental Christian saying the theory of evolution is up for debate because it doesn't match his world view.

&gt;It's the conclusion of the book, you can't just make fun of it in vacuum. Also, it's true: the rich are exploiting the poor. 

Do you know what's the difference between capitalism and socialism?

Under capitalism, man exploits man. Under socialism, it's the other way around.

&gt;I would want it.

Communism has never worked and yet people still attempt it. That is the definition of insanity - to constantly do the same thing and expect a different result.

&gt;Striving to improve things is human nature. I don't see why past failed experiments should stop people from trying again.

Then at least try something which has proven to work - capitalism. You can't deny it has massively improved the life quality of the people living under it.

&gt;Scientists never stop trying to achieve things even after failing hundreds of times; I don't see why societies should.

When a scientific experiment goes wrong, you can just try again. When you try to make a socialist society where everybody just willingly shares everything with everybody and people are supposed to work not for them but for they fellow men which they don't know and who isn't interested in helping them back, it always fails because that's not human nature and you always end up with a dysfunctional system where people are constantly poorer and where tyrants and demagogues are more likely to come to power taking advantage of the already bad conditions of the people.

&gt;PS: I will watch that first episode of the Friedman TV show and provide some commentary on it. 

Then please also watch the second episode where he instead of arguing for a free market, he argues against centralised planning and socialism. I'm sure it will give you some perspective.

And let it sink in, there's no need to come back running and comment on it, what he argues for is the exact opposite of your world view, I personally took quite some time to change from a christian to an atheist and from a social democrat to a classical liberal.",0,1367518239,null,0,false,0,c9r4gqm,t3_1defoo,t1_c9r4gqm,t1_c9qyuta,null,1431347376,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,almodozo,null,null,"&gt;I actually find it surprising that there isn't much talk in Germany about that, to be honest.

There used to be (assuming you mean after WW2 - the resentment after WW1 was obvious and partially fuelled Hitler's rise). Organizations for ""Heimatvertriebene"" used to be very powerful politically through the 50s and 60s, especially on the right and in Bavaria. 

Unlike with the Trianon trauma in Hungary, however, the grief and bitterness about the loss of territory was not 'inherited' by successive generations. It remained the personal feelings of those who themselves had lost their homes and pasts. It didn't turn into a nationalized, political trauma that every generation anew to some extent internalizes. 

That is not, after all, necessarily a 'natural' process. To instill in those who were not themselves expelled, nor heard first-hand accounts of expulsion from their parents, nevertheless a sense of collective aggrievement takes an intensive and deliberate nurturing of the aggrievement. It requires actively transmitting it through high school history classes and political rhetorics, which the Hungarians did intensively up through WW2 and to some extent again since the fall of communism. 

The Germans did not do that, partly for obvious reasons (any overt hint of irredentism being expressed officially would have doomed Germany's chances of rehabilitation in the international arena), partly out of genuine shame over Nazism, and partly because the economy grew and grew and Germany thus acquired new reasons to be satisfied and new symbolic grounds for national pride (the ""Wirtschaftswunder,"" Germany's increasingly central role in European politics, etc). 

It sometimes seems like Hungary never found anything that could be fashioned into a new symbolic greatness of some sort or other, which national pride could be invested in. And so, instead, those hungering for national symbols to bolster their identity have to keep returning to ""Trianon"".

Mind you, there's one other thing that helped quash an overt political impact of the trauma of loss of territory in Germany. While two-thirds of the Vertriebene settled in Western Germany, they were [spread widely enough](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimatvertriebene#Verteilung_in_Deutschland) that they made up no more than a quarter of the population in any of the states, and in some states made up just 5% or 10% of the population. One-third of them settled in Eastern Germany, and there they made up shares of the population sizable enough to potentially dominate - 45% in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, 33% in Brandenburg. But the communist regime obviously wasn't having any of that.",0,1367518362,null,0,false,0,c9r4ifw,t3_1djgfq,t1_c9r4ifw,t1_c9qxezz,null,1431347354,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

* That money can not go to an organization to divide it arbitrarily between the creators they want.

* Every citizen paying that money must be able to individually decide where it goes (which bands, authors, etc.).

* In case a citizen leaves it ""by default"", the distribution criteria must be public and verifiable. A way of doing this could be providing an official service where any author could make their work available for download, and extrapolate the proportions from there.

No one said that the federal Europe will be copy-paste of the US. 

&gt;The current situation is not an impetus for closer integration when it is integration that got Europe into this mess.

We are in this mess because the crucial part of integration - euro - was half baked (no banking union, no common fiscal policy etc). So, yes, the current mess is an impetus for closer integration.

&gt;It wouldn't be a return. We are still in the '""single market""'. 

We are way past single market for a long time. I know, i know, Thatcher sold you the EU as a ""simple"" single market. What can I say... you should read the papers of the founding fathers more carefuly? :)

&gt;Do you think we need Belgian and Irish diplomats negotiating the terms of how we export London's financial services?

You mean the european parliament and government... Btw they already do. 

&gt;Do you think France needs (or would even stand for) British diplomats negotiating wine trade deals?

They already do. But they are not called British diplomats, they are called European commissioners.

&gt; And while we're on the topic of united institutions, you think A United States of Europe could handle a giant centralised health care service akin to the NHS?

I do now know, but there is no need to have it either. With united institutions are ment mainly political institutions at the federal level (parliament, government, ...). Even US states have vastly different health-care systems.

It will be REALLY hot in the summer.  But generally the weather is great.  

&gt;Do the winters get very cold?

Kind of, but not compared to a lot of other places in Europe and the US.  You'll want to wear a jacket.  

&gt;Does it snow?

Rarely.  You might see snow once during the whole winter you are there.  

&gt;How are people generally?

Very warm, friendly, outgoing.  

&gt;What are the best places to meet people?

Probably school if you're a student.  Bars if you speak Spanish.  The internet if you don't.

&gt;Are there any ""hole-in-the-wall"" cool little places I should check out?

Yes!

&gt;I think in the Salamanca area. Is that a generally safe area?

Yes.

&gt;I'll be spending a few weeks near Cordoba. What should I expect there?

It's really beautiful.  It's really small compared to Madrid.  There are high speed trains between the cities.  It's one of my favorite cities in Spain and you'll probably love it.  I'm not sure what more to say.

Don't worry, you'll have an amazing time.  Eat the food, take in the culture.

No, I expected you to read it all and then post a short summary of your impressions of the general argument presented in the article. 

&gt; Because in real life there's no perfect information and nobody claims there is.

Well, if your economic model assumes that your economic actors have perfect information, then you've got a problem. 

&gt; You make up a model that accurately describes real life then without any simplifications. You'll do more than what any economist has ever done, you'll certainly win a nobel prize and will revolutionise social sciences forever, making them more accurate and precise. If you can pull it off, though, considering how impossible that is, good luck.

Haha, very funny. The difference is the despite the simplifications, the weather model is more or less an accurate depiction of the core dynamics of how the weather works. There's another fundamental difference, that the weather model is falsifiable and it's easy to gather lots of samples to make it work. Also, the fact that the problem is infinitely less complex than human behaviour also helps. I'm not saying that modelling economies is easy; quite the opposite: I'm somewhat scared that it might even be completely impossible with our current way of conducting science. 

&gt; Of course prices would be unchanged with fiscal policy, inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.

The mean an expansionary fiscal policy based on central bank funding, I think. 

&gt; Same thing with nowadays socialists and the dictators that have spawned under socialist regimes.

What exactly do you mean by this? Have you ever seen a left-wing person arguing for the re-introduction of gulags or something?

&gt; Index of Economic Freedom

This basically says that the ""Western"" countries have lots of ""economic freedom"" and at the same time are very rich. But the Western countries have always been the richest, so it's a bit like begging the question. I don't think this question can be settled so easily. The problems of correlation... 

&gt; Of course not, it's true because of the economic theory behind it and the empirical data that supports it.

That's too much handwaving for me. 

&gt; It's the same thing, between trade barriers and banning technology, both achieve the same result of lower unemployment and higher poverty.

I had not realised all left-wingers are protectionists...

&gt; And if a capitalist starts rich and mismanages his money, he'll become poor whereas some poor guy that works hard may very well die a wealthy and happy man so that his children can be spoiled brats that don't value what they own.

This is silly. I don't care if it possible, I care about how probable it is. Arich person does not even have to manage his fortune himself, he can pay professionals to do it. And a poor person who has to work all day just to get by hardly has any possibility to become rich. You are cherry-picking anecdotal evidence to support your claims; equality of opportunity isn't so simple. 

&gt; It's still a fairer system than real life where, for example, some people are born with great eyesight, others needing glasses and other blind.

&gt; The solution, however, isn't to bring everybody down to the same playing field, it's not by making the rich poor or those who see well blind that society will be better off.

I'm not suggesting to bring down everyone to the same level. The leftist motto is ""From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs"", not ""everyone must be the same; beep boop we are robots"". 

&gt; You can compare the minimum wages (as a percentage when compared to the average wage) and youth unemployment.

If it's so obvious, someone must have done a study about this, with real data, not just looking at a table of one moment in time. Also, I have already told you: lacking a minimum wage is essentially wage dumbing. Having low unemployment is a means to an end and that end is social welfare. I already know that you can have zero unemployment if everyone decides to sell themselves as slaves. 

&gt; You don't agree with anything that mainstream economists say, you prefer your dogma of Marxism, so don't say it's up to debate, that's like a fundamental Christian saying the theory of evolution is up for debate because it doesn't match his world view.

I had not realised that the Austrian school whose views you are spreading about the causes of the crisis had the same academic standing as Darwin's theory of evolution. Nor had I realised that left-wingers are considered as irrational as religious people. This is a strawman (and you know it). 

&gt; When a scientific experiment goes wrong, you can just try again. When you try to make a socialist society where everybody just willingly shares everything with everybody and people are supposed to work not for them but for they fellow men which they don't know and who isn't interested in helping them back, it always fails because that's not human nature and you always end up with a dysfunctional system where people are constantly poorer and where tyrants and demagogues are more likely to come to power taking advantage of the already bad conditions of the people.

The human nature argument. I told you, I don't buy it and I already suggested you some reading as to why it's not wise to make broad generalisations about what is and what isn't human nature. I don't think it's impossible to move to that direction without demagogues taking over. Also, your description of socialism is historically inaccurate. It has never been the case that a socialist society kept going democratically until conditions deteriorated and only then a tyrant took over. 

&gt; Then at least try something which has proven to work - capitalism. You can't deny it has massively improved the life quality of the people living under it.

There's too much room for improvement to sit idly. 

&gt; Then please also watch the second episode where he instead of arguing for a free market, he argues against centralised planning and socialism. I'm sure it will give you some perspective.

I'm already against having an aristocratic bureaucracy that makes five-year plans that decide all economic development. That's stupid. I'm also not entirely against using the free market is some situations. I'm only against the free market in the sense that ""if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail""; some people think it can be applied in all economic/political matters. That's silly. With that in mind, do you want to alter your suggestion about which episode to watch?

&gt; And let it sink in, there's no need to come back running and comment on it, what he argues for is the exact opposite of your world view, I personally took quite some time to change from a christian to an atheist and from a social democrat to a classical liberal.

To think that there's just one ideological transition that is possible during one's life! You really think that because you were once religious and now you aren't and because you were once a social democrat and now you aren't, that you found the correct choice and everything is done? I've changed my world-view quite a few times already, and you should continue to challenge your views too if you want to be honest with yourself.

Sure it's not got that huge city feeling like Manchester, or London, but you have the economic opportunity and the educational opportunity and it's not ""slow"", but it's not racing fast. You have the chance to chat to a friend in the street because you bumped into them and not be jostled by thousands of commuters. You have the chance to hold the door open for someone even in the city centre. It's just nice. Oh, and you're never very far away from the countryside and it's got the most green spaces of any city in England. It is a very pretty city, but comparing it to some of these continental European cities is just too harsh.

And indeed there is none within the Eurozone (and probably within the EU).  Since currency is controlled by ECB, which in turn can directly control the local governments and impose whatever crazy ideas they have, it's vital that a people's struggle goes through political organisations that are at the very least willing to leave the Euro.  

There are no such majority or close to majority parties in anywhere in Europe AFAIK. People have mostly concentrated their rage towards their local politicians, which are nothing more than mere puppets in the hands of large Capital and Eurocrats.  

Also, you can't just be angry. Destroying the old is vital, but since we are too scared to voice realistic proposal on how to organise societies, the only alternative becomes fascism and its friends, the logical extension of a dog-eat-dog worldview.

That's precisely why I said *pretty much all* and not *all* restrictions :p

Just like it's illegal to steal (which is when the burglar unilaterally benefits at the expense of the person that was robbed), it must also be illegal to pollute (which is when the polluter unilaterally benefits at the expense of society).

But then again this argument of mine also applies against trade barriers (when the national producers benefit at the expense of the national consumers) and governmental subsidies (when the receivers of such subsidies benefit at the expense of the taxpayers), and just these two examples are often prevalent and legally enforced so it's not like it's a position that those in public office would tend to agree with.

&gt;And while I am for a low corporate tax rate, I think they should pay something as corporations do use the court systems, our roads, water system, etc.

Companies already paid for that directly with VAT and the owners and shareholders also pay for it with the personal income tax.

&gt;If zero tax would translate into higher wages I would be fine with it, but I don't see why they would, so they must pay something.

Err.. lower taxes quite clearly do translate into higher wages.

It would not be an immediate effect, first companies in trouble would try to balance their situation, only later would they be able produce more and hire more workers and lead to higher growth and lower unemployment and only later with the higher profits and lower unemployment would wages increase, but it would happen.",0,1367524211,null,0,false,0,c9r6oop,t3_1djnxq,t1_c9r6oop,t1_c9r5d1e,null,1431346329,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Well, if your economic model assumes that your economic actors have perfect information, then you've got a problem. 

People do try to inform themselves whenever it's worth their while, sure, they might not bother to check if the store down the street has grapes that are .20€ cheaper but they do try to get the best information they can about the market if they're doing something like buying a car or an house.

Information is not perfect but in the models it's assumed because otherwise it would be impossible to predict anything. Just like you let meteorologists get away with going with ""high pressures =&gt; tomorrow it won't rain"" you must allow economists to get away with ""increase in prices =&gt; demand will fall"".

&gt;The difference is the despite the simplifications, the weather model is more or less an accurate depiction of the core dynamics of how the weather works.

And the neoclassical model is an accurate depiction of the core dynamics of how the economy works. If you set your social ideology aside and look at the empirical evidence, you'll realise that.

&gt;There's another fundamental difference, that the weather model is falsifiable and it's easy to gather lots of samples to make it work. Also, the fact that the problem is infinitely less complex than human behaviour also helps. I'm not saying that modelling economies is easy; quite the opposite: I'm somewhat scared that it might even be completely impossible with our current way of conducting science. 

So, like the economists who use the models, you criticise them, yet you also say we should ditch them and leave nothing better on the table.

I'm afraid that's not a viable solution, models that are right except whenever there's some exogenous factor also influencing the data is certainly something better to work with than with nothing at all.

&gt;The mean an expansionary fiscal policy based on central bank funding, I think.

If the quantity of money grows faster than the actual output in the economy, expect inflation. If not, then don't. This always hold true in the medium to long run and here's a formula for you to understand it better:

*m* = *p* + *y*

*m* means the growth of the money supply, *p* means the growth in inflation and *y* means the growth in the GDP in real terms. If *m* grows faster than *y*, then inflation and prices will eventually rise to make up the difference. I say eventually because, as you know, there's wage and price stickiness and so this doesn't hold true in the short run.

&gt;What exactly do you mean by this? Have you ever seen a left-wing person arguing for the re-introduction of gulags or something?

Quite the opposite, it's the wannabe dictators that always do it on the left-wing grounds. The greatest harm always comes from those who think they know best and want to impose their view on society, you have countless examples of socialism gone wrong.

This is in sharp contrast with capitalist societies where everybody is free to do as he pleases and to pursue his own self-interest without order from a central authority and without those in command taking away some of the product of his labour and using it as they see fit.

&gt;This basically says that the ""Western"" countries have lots of ""economic freedom"" and at the same time are very rich.

Countries like Hong Kong and Singapore are Asian but regardless.

&gt;But the Western countries have always been the richest, so it's a bit like begging the question.

What about the Western/Eastern Europe divide? [Purchasing power in Europe](http://i.imgur.com/d26f998.jpg) vs [Former Cold War bloc](http://i.imgur.com/LZ0zf7w.png).

&gt;I had not realised all left-wingers are protectionists...

A lot do try to promote employment at the expense of productivity.

&gt;I don't care if it possible, I care about how probable it is. Arich person does not even have to manage his fortune himself, he can pay professionals to do it.

And yet you have countless stories of people who had it all and squandered everything, from rags to riches and back to rags.

&gt;And a poor person who has to work all day just to get by hardly has any possibility to become rich.

And yet, in a market with very few regulations, it's common occurrence. I just checked the 5 richest people in the world, Carlos Slim, Bill Gates, Amancio Ortega, Warren Buffet and Larry Ellison, none of them come from a wealthy background.

&gt;You are cherry-picking anecdotal evidence to support your claims; equality of opportunity isn't so simple. 

What cherry-picking? You're right, equality of opportunity isn't simple, but equality of wealth regardless of the circumstances is theft.

That's what equality actually is, it's A and B deciding what C shall do for D while taking a commission off on the way.",0,1367529698,null,0,false,0,c9r8r3o,t3_1defoo,t1_c9r8r3o,t1_c9r5fmv,null,1431345356,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;I'm not suggesting to bring down everyone to the same level. The leftist motto is ""From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs""

From each according to their ability =&gt; then great, let them decide what they're good at in the marketplace, let's not violate their freedom to choose for themselves and let's not try to tell them what to do, not only would that be authoritarian, it could very well lead to inefficiency.

To each according to their needs =&gt; it should be to each according to their ability except in those circumstances where one is really miserable and can't sustain himself, and even so, I'd be very reluctant to try and divide the wealth pie because we all know nobody actually cares for those who are worse off, people only care for themselves, you redistribute and redistribute and the politicians and the special interests only get wealthier while the number of the people on the bottom goes on increasing because of the policies they're pursuing in the capital.

&gt;If it's so obvious, someone must have done a study about this, with real data, not just looking at a table of one moment in time.

There have been plenty of studies, look them up. Heck, you can even youtube for minimum wage, there's plenty of videos, I even posted one, if you don't bother watching then I won't bother posting.

&gt;Also, I have already told you: lacking a minimum wage is essentially wage dumbing.

And if it worked in increasing wages as opposed to increasing unemployment, then the minimum wage should be much higher. Meanwhile, Singapore has no minimum wage, Hong Kong was decades without it, Switzerland has no statutory minimum wage, same with Germany or Austria or Denmark or Sweden or Norway or Finland and yet all these countries have much higher incomes and wages and lower unemployment (specially among teens and immigrants) than countries such as Greece or Portugal with their minimum wages close to 60% the average wage.

&gt;Having low unemployment is a means to an end and that end is social welfare.

I'd say having low unemployment is a means to an end and that end is productivity and purchasing power.

&gt;I already know that you can have zero unemployment if everyone decides to sell themselves as slaves. 

Yet workers, same as employers, aren't willing to get less than what they offer, so that's not viable.

But that approach at unemployment is just as ludicrous as, say, restricting foreign trade, depreciating the currency, limiting working hours, banning technology, drafting people into the army or telling people to open up ditches and filling them back up, to give a few examples.

&gt;I had not realised that the Austrian school whose views you are spreading about the causes of the crisis had the same academic standing as Darwin's theory of evolution.

I'm not promoting the Austrian school, I for example don't agree with their approach to monetary policy, so yeah.

&gt;Nor had I realised that left-wingers are considered as irrational as religious people. This is a strawman (and you know it). 

Well, I do consider your faith in the socialism really dogmatic, considering all the evidence there is that it doesn't work.

&gt;I told you, I don't buy it and I already suggested you some reading as to why it's not wise to make broad generalisations about what is and what isn't human nature.

You name a situation where a society has sustained itself on any longer period of time relying only on the good will of others and not with individuals trying to pursue their separate self-interests.

&gt;I don't think it's impossible to move to that direction without demagogues taking over.

[Socialism is force](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYeYPcougmA) - a 6min video

&gt;Also, your description of socialism is historically inaccurate. It has never been the case that a socialist society kept going democratically until conditions deteriorated and only then a tyrant took over. 

Fortunately, under a democratic system, people just vote away the socialists, like what happened in the UK before Thatcher. Nevertheless, there's always creeping statism and conditions always deteriorate under any longer period of time with a central authority planning things.

&gt;There's too much room for improvement to sit idly. 

Yet the places in the world where the people are better off are those that don't try to improve on it. Damn, you really need to watch the first two episodes of Free to Choose.

&gt;I'm already against having an aristocratic bureaucracy that makes five-year plans that decide all economic development. That's stupid.

So how will you redistribute the wealth? You can't do it without planning, you must decide who shall pay and who shall benefit.

&gt;I'm only against the free market in the sense that ""if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail""

I don't understand. Though if all you have is an hammer and you don't want nails, you can always lend the hammer to a carpenter and benefit from it or just outright sell it and something else useful to you - that's the beauty of capitalism, you do what's best for you and nobody restricts it.

&gt;With that in mind, do you want to alter your suggestion about which episode to watch?

You should watch [episode 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3N2sNnGwa4) and [episode 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJWLt1TmAy4). At least the first 30 minutes where he explains things, the other 30 minutes are a debate with people trying to discuss his views and with people with views similar to yours arguing against him and him answering back.

I found the whole series incredibly interesting and it certainly helped me a lot in further defining my views on politics and on economics.

&gt;You really think that because you were once religious and now you aren't and because you were once a social democrat and now you aren't, that you found the correct choice and everything is done?

That wasn't the point I'm making, I was telling you that it's an entirely different view and that nobody changes their world-view like that overnight.

&gt;you should continue to challenge your views too if you want to be honest with yourself.

true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"&gt;Are you f*king kidding me? You need to change a paragraph in the constitution and change some county borders and that's somehow not so simple? It's just text and words, you could do it today if only you wanted. 

Romania is not a dictatorship. Changing the constitution, the fundamental law that governs this nation, is not as simple as clapping your hands. Just to give you an idea of what it takes:

A revizing of the constitution can only be initiated by the president at the request of the government, at least a quarter of the number of Deputies or Senators as well as at least 500.000 citizens with the right to vote. After meeting these conditions the Constitutional Court must analyze if this legislative proposition is constitutional, if it doesn't violate the the limits on revizing set upon by Article 152 of the Constitution and if everything else is in order legally speaking.

If all goes well then the proposition will go to Parliament to begin the legislative process. In order for the proposition to pass it must have a two thirds approval both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate. Assuming it passes the Chamber and Senate it must then be subjected to a referendum.  

Changing county borders is just as complex. 


&gt;I bet you changed the constitution when Ceausescu was overthrown, right? How was that possible if it's so difficult?

It was under extraordinary circumstances, a revolution, that a new constitution was drafted, not revised mind you. It's been twenty years since then. If Romania is to remain a democratic state, any major revising of its basic governing law must be done through the proper channels. 

&gt;What you are basically saying is that you won't grant the wishes of a population because you were assholes in the past and wrote some shit in the constitution to prevent them from gaining autonomy. 

I'm not sure where this aggression is coming from. Firstly, the wishes of the Hungarian minority have been granted to the fullest extent of the law. They have the right to propagate both their culture and language and the government has made ample efforts to afford them that right up to and including Hungarian only schools, bilingual signs, the ability to address public officials using their maternal language etc. If any minority in this country is discriminated against it's definitely the Roma. 

Secondly, the Constitution was not written with the express purpose of denying minorities regional autonomy. I have no idea how you could come to such a conclusion. 

&gt;I think it's time to fix the errors you did in the past. 

You make it sound as if Hungarians in this country are treated like the scum of the Earth. Have you ever actually been to Transylvania? 

&gt;Don't give me that shit about how it's difficult...

But it is difficult. The reason Fidesz was capable of amending the constitution of Hungary with relative ease was because they have control of the Constitutional Court and an outstanding majority in the Hungarian Parliament and they also didn't have to hold referendums for every change. Romania is in a similar situation right now except the current party to hold an outstanding majority has to hold a referendum for every change they make which puts a big hamper on their ambitions.

&gt;For example, will Martin Schulz lead the social democratic list in Sweden? No, because member states take on the role of voting constituencies in European elections, and that is why the candidates in Sweden will always be Swedes. But although Swedish citizens will not have the option of voting for Martin Schulz, that does not mean that he will not feature on the posters that are stuck up across the country if he becomes the European socialist candidate. This is, to say the least, confusing.

This is not at all confusing. I didn't have the option of voting for Enda Kenny, yet he appeared on many posters in my constituency because I had the option of voting for his party. The author seems to be familiar *only* with the list system. 

&gt;On a purely formal level, the electoral process is not crystal clear either. Under the terms of article 17 of the Lisbon Treaty, the appointment of the president of the Commission will take into “account the elections to the European Parliament,"" but the candidate will be proposed by the European Council of national heads of state. All too complicated. It is a safe bet that the 2014 election will be a disappointment. Political leaders will continue to have the last word.

This simply isn't complicated. The European Council propose a candidate, taking into account the election results. It is the Parliament that *elects* the Commission President. That is simply to say that the Council *must* propose the candidate who will have the confidence of the Parliament. This, too, is how it works in most national systems. Generally the Head of State will propose someone to form a Government. But it's useless to propose anyone other than the winner of the election. The only reason that option is reserved is for instances such as we just had in Italy, or in Belgium after the last election. In this context, it's easiest just to picture the European Council as a collective ""Head of State"".

you can buy your tickets to the vatican at [this website](http://biglietteriamusei.vatican.va/musei/tickets/do?action=booking).

also, once you enter the museum, i suggest bypassing all exhibits and heading straight for the sistine chapel. It is at the end of the museum so you will have a big headstart. Get to the chapel early when there is only a handful of people present and you will truly be able to appreciate its majesty. Once you have expereinced all you need/desire from the sistine chapel, retrace your steps to the start of the museum and take your time to enjoy everything else.

Ob Kausal das Testeron dafür verantwortlich ist mag ich nicht beurteilen. In der Summe aller psychologischer Effekte die da Wirken hat das ganze aber dennoch Substanz.

 while in Bologna you can arrange a visit to Ducati, Ferrari or Lamborghini factories if you're interested, they're worth a visit.  as another redditor said Bologna is great for its central position, you can easily head to Florence and Venice from there; also if the weather is fine you could visit Rimini or even better Ravenna, which has got a lot of cultural heritage. The riviera is really nice in summer/hot season. 

For the food, look for some trattoria or osteria on the road to taste the flavors of cucina emiliana, there are a lot of nice restaurant also in the city center not only in the countryside but naturally they might be more expensive.

There has to be room for investment which, will cause more debt, in order to get us out of this recession. Or the euro simply has to devaluate but since Germany holds all the strings that is very unlikely to happen.

The Netherlands made the mistake by joining Germany and being super tough on the PIGS when they desperately needed support, now that we can't seem to handle our debt-reduction based recovery we are joining the negative spiral as well.

There is plenty of capital in the market, just not available. Banks had to drastically increase their reserves in order to not be labelled a ""bad bank"". This either by political pressure, rating agencies or public opinion. Emphasis has been on debt reduction, but not on recovery. 

I personally believe debt reduction is a policy that should be aimed at times of economic growth, not free fall! How on earth are we supposed to lower debt, when all debt reducting policies being implemented are also Demand reducting policies? How are going to achieve growth or recovery then?

The 3% line that has been ruled with an ironfist is the ultimate downfall, by incapacitating countries to invest and grow it focusses all attention on spending-cuts. It is great that the ECB is lowering interest so banks can lend more from the ECB, but that money will also not leave the banks, it will just stay there. Wich will lead to the bailout bubble as mentioned by bogdanvladir.

At least, that is what I believe.

The summer be very hot, so buy a fan. You may have AC but if you are staying with a family, they will be very hesitant to use it.

Was mich weiterhin nervt ist die Argumentation, dass weil ja spendet selbst sagen kann, dass er kein schlechter Mensch ist. Und überhaupt gibt es da eine Konnotation in der Debatte, nach dem Motto - aber er hat ja auch gespendet!11! 

Das ist auch schön von Ihm (wirklich!) hat aber wie der ganze emotionale Krempel nichts mit dem Vorwurf gegenüber Ihm zu tun. 

Und wenn er sagt, dass er auf einmal auf der anderen Seite der Gesellschaft steht, dann ist das einfach lächerlich. Muss man nicht weiter ausführen. 

Er hat mutmaßlich eine Straftat begangen. Sollen die Gerichte entscheiden ob er schuldig ist oder nicht. 

Wenn er kein schlechter Mensch sein will, dann muss man mir das nicht medial auf allen Kanälen entgegen-tröten. Das muss er mit sich selbst und seinen Umfeld aushandeln.

No offence or disrespect - but it sounds like Belgium is full of overtly sensitive people who can't respect other people who are even mildly different from them, so they need the state to step in to make them mindless automatons. How about instead of government legislating what you can or can't wear at work (and let's be honest, the only issue here really is religious symbols), you guys just grow up, accept that people are different, and don't let it get in the way of doing business, governing, and administration. If someone wearing some religious symbol really gets your panties in a bunch, maybe the problem is with you, not with the person wearing the religious symbol (and again, I'm going to go ahead and say that people who do wear religious symbols are borderline mentally retarded. Especially Christians, who do so against the bible and their favorite character, Jesus).

Separate church and state, absolutely, but if you eliminate even the most benign personal expression and freedoms, even if its just at the public (government) workplace, you're taking a step towards a ridiculous form of authoritarianism.

Nilpferde habe ich noch nie in Natur gesehen. Gibts Nilpferde jetzt auch nicht, nur weil ich noch keines gesehen habe? Empirische, wissenschaftliche Forschung hat mit Glauben nichts am Hut.

Aber nicht unmöglich.

Bis heute gibt es keinen Beweis für/gegen die Existenz eines allmächtigen Wesens bzw. Schicksal bzw. Vorsehung bzw. Plan etc. Nenn es wie du willst. Worin wir aber übereinstimmen, ist, dass die Bibel kein Tatsachenbericht ist, sondern ein Geschichtensammlung, geschrieben von fehlbaren Menschen. Das sagt aber nichts über die Existenz anderer Dinge aus.

Gerade Schicksal ist ein anderes Wort für Gott. Daran glauben jedoch viele immer wieder gerne. Wird teilweise auch durch Studien belegt, insofern, dass unser Universum vermutlich ein determenistisches ist, da wir nicht wissen, ob wahrer Zufall überhaupt exstiert. Wenn wahrer Zufall aber nicht existiert, sondern nur chaotisches Verhalten (Ergebnisse hängen extrem vom Anfangszustand ab: kleine Änderungen im Anfang, wie z.B. ein Windhauch, führen zu komplett unterschiedlichen Ergebnissen), dann wäre es prinzipiell möglich jedes Ereignis zu berechnen, wenn man den exakten Zustand des Systems zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt kennen würde. Sprich: Im Big Bang wäre dann alle Information bis zum Ende des Universums enthalten und alles würde einem exakten Plan folgen. Damit wäre jemand, der den Big Bang beeinflussen könnte, ein Allmächtiger Gott, der unser aller Schicksal bestimmt, jedoch nicht (mehr) eingreift, da damit sein Plan zerstört würde.

true,themadlombard,SKAN,Scania,"If things continue as they are and Europe does not unite (at least with a single foreign policy and a single military) within 50 years Europe will become more and more irrelevant to the international order. It is a simple question of mathematics and economics.
Developing countries are growing at many times the rate of European countries. By mid century, they will be nearly caught up. The EU population is projected to only increase by 3 million by 2060 (and if it wasn't for immigration, it would decrease). Outside of Europe fertility is much higher. By 2050 it is projected that India will increase her population by over 300m, the US with 120m, Nigeria with over 200m. Meanwhile in Europe by 2060 the old age dependency ration will more than double to 53.5%.

So in the future you will have lots of newly developed countries with populations larger and younger than in Europe. For me, unification is not a choice, it is a necessity if Europe wishes to remain relevant.

EU combined forces are much stronger than Russian army. Most EU forces are professional armies with latest high tech weapons. EU is prolly second only to the US when it comes to military might.

Any sort of Russian invasion would be much bigger problem for Russia than EU because of the size of the EU and how it is positioned around Russia. Russia can't project naval forces against EU, so EU would have open supply lines. Russia would have very hard time trying to fight on multiple fronts with extended supply lines from their bases to the theater of operation. While Belarus might side with Russia, Ukraine still stands between Russia and EU.

It would be a nightmare for Russian to do it. They had hard time breaking Germans in WW2 and they always lost more men and equipment in major battles due to their tactics and disregard for human life. And they didn't have their flanks open while they went for Germany which wouldn't be a case if they tried to invade EU.

Ach? Wenn man GLAUBT, es gibt keine Götter, dann ist das kein GLAUBE? Was dann? Zahnpasta? Siehe weiter unten: Übrigens ist es ein Unterschied ob ich sage: ""Ich glaube an nichts"" oder ""Ich glaube nicht"".

&gt; So machen es ja auch New-Age-Anhänger und andere Pseudowissenschaftler. Sie definieren ihre magischen Schwingungswellen oder was auch immer einfach mal ausserhalb der Wissenschaft. In der Realität ist es aber so, dass alles, was einen Einfluss auf unsere Welt hat, auch wissenschaftlich nachweisbar ist, wenn auch nur theoretisch. Ansonsten ist es entweder irrelevant oder nicht existent.

Wissenschaftliche Nachweisbarkeit von Dunkler Materie/Energie? Können wir gerne streiten. Nur weil man etwas (noch) nicht nachweisen kann, heißt es nicht, dass es das nicht gibt. Irrelevant zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt? Ja. Mit Nichtexistenz wäre ich aber sehr sehr vorsichtig.

&gt; Die Beweislast liegt aber bei dem, der die Existenz eines solchen Wesens postuliert.

Oder dem, der sagt, dass es sie nicht gibt. Was man übrigens nicht beweisen kann. Aber da man bisher keines gesehen hat, keine Auswirkungen gespürt hat, ist wohl anzunehmen, dass es unwahrscheinlich ist. Aber nicht unmöglich.

&gt; Durch sprichst hier von Pantheismus.

Und das widerspricht aber der Aussage: ""Ich glaube an nichts."" (Womit wir angefagen haben). Damit glaubt man auch nicht an Schicksal etc. Übrigens ist es ein Unterschied ob ich sage: ""Ich glaube an nichts"" oder ""Ich glaube nicht"".

This is not the case with the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Spain and Italy all very well developed and competitive countries  (but Italy is a different story all together they have had a massive debt since for ever, why everyone is losing their mind about it now I don't understand). *Anyhow* Those are the countries facing difficulties recovering their economies due to the impossibility to grow debt and get back on track. All we can do is keep cutting spending, keep on the austerity track to reach the 3% goal. Now this will not bring us back to recovery.

I understand that thought that low level of debt to GDP will boost investors(banks) confidence and they will start lending money to fuel the economy and therefore we should continue with austerity until we reach this magical turn, but this will never be the case with the current policies.

Look at we are doing now, we are giving financial institutions even more money, money that they cannot lend (they had to increase reserves and securities) and will not lend to the public, which will only further increase the bubble. And in the meanwhile, driven by austerity all these countries are reducing spending and crippling demand.

Nein, sie wurden nicht bestätigt, sie wurden nur in unzähligen Experimenten noch nicht falsifiziert. Das ist ein Unterschied. In hundert Jahren lachen sie vielleicht über diese seltsamen Theorien, wer weiß? Vielleicht ist alles, was wir heute haben, genauso Blödsinn wie die Sonne, die um die Erde kreist:

Damals hatten sie ein kompliziertes Model der Planeten und konnten alle Umlaufbahnen zeimlich exakt vorhersagen. Was sie als einziges nicht konnten, war erklären, warum die Planeten manchmal vor und manchmal hinter der Sonne war. Auftritt Kopernikus. Seine Berechnungen waren (anfangs) schlechter als die Geozentrische Theorie, da er glaubte, die Planeten wären auf Kreisbahnen unterwegs. Aber er konnte das mit den Planeten erklären. Zunächst entstand dann sogar eine Mischform: Alle Planeten kreisen um die Sonne, und die Sonne um die Erde. Erst Kepler (eigtl. Tychobrahe) konnte dann mit neuer Technik genauere Messungen machen und stellte dann das elliptische Model auf, welches dann alle Probleme zufriedenstellend lösen konnte. Bis auf die Bahn des Merkur. Dann kam Einstein und jetzt können wir die auch rechnen. Scheint alles gut zu sein, wäre da nicht diese ganze Sache mit Dunkler Energie/Materie. Vielleicht liegen wir ja wieder falsch. Und wir bräuchten vielleicht was anderes? Keine Ahnung. Aber möglich ist es, dass wir total falsch liegen. Vor 120 Jahren war der Äther auch ein ""Naturgesetz"" und wurde als (mehr oder weniger) bewiesen angesehen.

Und daraus entspringt auch das missverständnis mit Ockhams Razor: Wenn du zwei Theorien hast, die beide dasselbe Ergebnis bringen, dann nimmst du die, die weniger Aufwand bedeutet. Nicht weil sie richtig ist. Sondern weil du dir die Arbeit nicht antun brauchst, weil es die Arbeit nicht wert ist.

stell dir vor, du hast einen Apfel, der vom Baum fällt. Du kannst es analytisch Lösen: Runde Kugel, Reibung beschrieben mit simplem Gesetz mit einer Konstante. Kann ich lösen in 1 Stunde max. Oder ich rechne es komplett quantenmechanisch, relativistisch, mit unebener Oberfläche, volle Breitseite mit 3D Navier stokes Gleichungen, etc. Rechenzeit: Undendlich.

Ich glaube an nichts vs. Ich glaube nichts.

&gt;&gt; Wissenschaftliche Nachweisbarkeit von Dunkler Materie/Energie? Können wir gerne streiten. Nur weil man etwas (noch) nicht nachweisen kann, heißt es nicht, dass es das nicht gibt. Irrelevant zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt? Ja. Mit Nichtexistenz wäre ich aber sehr sehr vorsichtig.

&gt; Die Auswirkung von dunkler Materie sowie dunkler Energie kann man klar beobachte, sonst wäre man gar nie auf die Idee gekommen. Auf das Eingreifen von Götter in unsere Welt gibt es keine Hinweise.

Ich werde da nicht weiter darauf eingehen, aber so viel sei gesagt: Ich persönlich bin da sehr kritisch eingestellt, was Dunkle Energie/Materie betrifft. Nur weil da irgendwas in einer Gleichung auftaucht. Vielleicht ist die Gleichung falsch. Oder zumindest die Grundanahme. Ich persönlich glaube (?!) dass die Naturkonstanten keine Konstanten sind und es daher auch evtl. gar keinen Big Bang gab, sondern die Rotverschiebung aus einem Effekt kommt, den wir noch nicht kennen. Und nicht kennen werden, bis wir dort sind.

&gt;&gt; Und das widerspricht aber der Aussage: ""Ich glaube an nichts."" (Womit wir angefagen haben).

Ist das so? Warum hat das den bisher so gut funktioniert bei den Griechen? Sie waren ja nicht seit gestern koruppt. Denk doch mal darüber nach. Frage dich z.B. ob die Billiglohnpolitik der Nachbarländer wie Deutschland nicht vielleicht dieses **funktionierende** System zum Einsturz gebracht hat. 

Griechenland hatte kaum Industrie. Die war auch noch von damals und eher dazu gedacht den eigenen Markt zu versorgen. Der griechischen Industrie ging es aber gut. Bis der Euro kam. Bis die Importe billiger wurden als die halbwegs normal bezahlten eigenen Produkte. Unter anderem dank Deutschland und der Billiglohnpolitik hier. 

Die Ausgaben des Staates kamen grösstenteils den eigenen Leuten zugute. Nun hat man ihnen einen Sparkurs veordnet, staatseigene Betriebe an Heuschrecken verkauft, Verträge verschlechtert/gekündigt und das allgemeine Lohnniveau gesenkt.

* Catalans do not pay more taxes than other spaniards.
* The catalan provinces of Gerona, Lérida and Tarragona have fiscal surplus - they receive more than they give to the state, should Barcelona separate from them, to another autonomico community? Should Pedralbes, a rich neighborhood of Barcelona, separate from el Ensanche? Should millionaires of Catalonia get independence, so that they don't have to pay the people's education with their taxes?
* The government investment in Catalonia is average, despite other regions in need of development.
* The yearly ""fiscal deficit"" of catalonia is about 12,000 million euros. Catalonia profits about 60,000 millions yearly from its economic relationship with the rest of Spain, benefitting as a whole. It would be really stupid for the government to ""starve"" a region.

**Identity**  
All regions of Spain have their own identity, from Asturias to Canary Islands, or from Murcia to Cantabria. Being catalan is a way of being spanish, as is being galician, like being from Normandy is being french and being bavarian is being german.
Nationalists know this, so they fixate on language:

**Language**  
Catalonia has its own additional language. Regional TV is presented completely in catalan, basic education is imparted completely in catalan, and higher education mostly so (professors may choose to impart in spanish, e.g. if there are students who recently moved to Catalonia).

**History**  
There are no historic reasons for independence *at all*. Catalonia has never been occupied by Spain, neither by castillian armadas in the middle ages. At some point, hundreds of years ago, kingdoms and counties where overthrown or passed to neighbouring counties and kingdoms merged. Many regions of spain changed hands, so did Catalonia. Nationalists manipulate catalan history into a picture where it was somehow occupied by Spain.  
Sadly the freedom spain's government gives to autonomies to regulate their educational system is often abused to manipulate history.

**Survival of identity**  
There is no such danger to the catalan culture. Castillian (tradiational spanish) on the other hand, is actively being displaced by nationalists, despite having always been part of the catalon identity.

**Relation to the government**  
There has never been contempt from the spanish government nor from rest of the spanish people to Catalonia, until nationalists attacked Spain and immediately painted themselves as victims.

**Power and politics**  
Spanish autonomic regions' self management is at a higher level than in most other countries. Since the end of the fascist dictatorship, there has been prioritization to give all regions as much freedom as possibly, while remaining one democratic country. Catalonia has always been a priority for the goverment *even since before the dictatorship*.  
There are very aggressive attempts to ""catalanize"", (as in ""catalan nationalism"", not catalan language or culture) from nationalists, ranging from fines for not labeling in catalan language, almost ridicilous ""victimism campaigns"" and historic manipulation.  

IMHO, after years of borderline propaganda and manipulation through education and media, catalan independence now seems to be a business model for political parties, music and general lifestyle. It's easier to blame someone else, and it's easier to say ""I'll just leave"" instead of fixing the problem. It is also kind of backwards - Europe is an effort to move **together** - take a look at the german reunification.

[Frischkäse Ananas/Mango](http://www.exquisa.de/Produktwelt_Frischkaese_Fruechtchen.php) is somewhat  new - its derived from [Tolko Frischkäsering](https://www.lebensmittel.de/productpics/16171282/w_400/h_400/16171282.jpg) (pineapple/almond or rum/hazelnut  are popular flavours)
but it is missing the nuts.

Strawberry+cream cheese and Nutella+cream cheese is a thing now.

Funnily, the husband of crown princess Margaret is a layman and a now-retired actor. Not a very good one, but still an actor.

Chi protesta contro la vecchia politica non fa donazioni al movimento,ma semplicemente lo vota per aumentare il segnale dell'insoddisfazione.

Comunque ti dirò,anche io non sono d'accordo con un abolizione totale dei finanziamenti pubblici ma,non è detto che sia un abolizione per sempre o che non si debba dialogare seriamente sui pro e i contro di tale abolizione.
Ricordo che i partiti prendono già un sacco di soldi dai privati e che quindi la scusa che vince il partito che attrae più finanziatori non regge molto..

I 5s hanno la coerenza che in italia è cosa nuova e da frutti nel medio lungo periodo.Sono sicuramente ancora un movimento acerbo sotto certi aspetti ma non è che gli altri avversari brillino.

La situazione che abbiamo oggi ha radici che non risalgono a 3 mesi fa,dirlo è da ingenui.
Facile pretendere che gli ultimi arrivati si pieghino alle logiche di un sistema malato,bruciando così gli unici valori che li differenziano.
Questo è un pensiero che magari sembra utile oggi ma che falsifica gli ideali per cui si è costituito il movimento e che probabilmente lo distruggerebbe.
Il modo più facile per distruggere un nemico è inglobarlo e piegarlo.E questo i 5 stelle lo sanno.

true,HadoopThePeople,EURO,European Union,"&gt;Soviet growth after the 50s was anaemic

Soviet yes, Warsaw pact no. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland are examples of powerful industries during the 70s and 80s, which were outdated in the 90s... but they were anything but anemic. I'll get back to this.

&gt;Soviet computing was light years behind the US

Well, true, because they were lead by morons who couldn't understand the use of ""computing power"" over ""power"". Thus, the eastern mechanics were top notch (MiG maneuverability was way better than anything the West had in the 80s, soyuz is still in use etc) but they were big, hunky, clunky machines that did everything hardware with no software whatsoever. 

&gt;The fact still stands that China is powerful and are becoming more so everyday.For practical purposes I think they should be considered a superpower. 

If you compare soviet union with china nowadays, China wins on all accounts except autonomy. If isolated, they would stop that advance, whereas the ussr dominated half the globe while keeping away from the Western powers. They could have easily wiped those powers from the map and still go on. China depends on EU and US trade. But by that standard, the US is no longer a superpower, if it will make you happy (this is a view point shared by many military and economy ""experts"").

&gt;Why is Eastern Europe so poor today after all?

That's so complex... First, it's because those economies were built to be self sustained. By the end of the 80s for example, Romania imported almost nothing (which is why it sucked so much... no oranges grow in Romania) and exported a lot of its stuff to African and Asian nations (usually the crappy ones, like Libya or China). Well, a lot of those mechanisms depended on a nation wide synergy... even if a factory/plant/research institute was loosing money, others weren't. Plus, there was no competition internally and all you had to do was sell some products cheaper than others. Well, when that synergy disappeared going to capitalism, a lot of those factories/plants and stuff went down, creating unemployment. Then, China and plastic killed most of the products being delivered. 

You know, my parents still have a fridge that's working (the only fridge in the house by the way) that's almost 40 years old. That's the kind of products being made by the Eastern economies: ugly but reliable. The world moved towards programmed obsolescence, towards changing one's stuff every 5 years. You can't ask the same price as before for a product, coming back to that fridge: would you pay €2000 for a regular ugly fridge, just because it might last you 40 years? That's a difficult sell point. So, even those products that were getting a profit in the 80s, failed in the 90s. The East had to, and still has to, reinvent all of its industry. This is why you'll see a lot of programmers coming from the East: that was the easiest thing to reinvent and people adapted quickly (especially since the education systems were at Swedish levels until the mid 90s). And I could talk all day about this, and I'd love input, but I've got some programming to do :-).

Travaglio sembra molto più incline a lasciar perdere le cazzate che fa il M5S che quelle degli altri partiti, e questa mia opinione è supportata dai fatti ben esposti nel post di OP. Sono passati mesi nei quali, un giorno sì e l'altro pure, Grillo, Casaleggio e i probi viri del M5S facevano a gara a chi allungava di più la lista di quelli con cui non avrebbero **mai** fatto un governo, di quelli con cui non sarebbero **mai**, per nulla al mondo scesi a compromessi; ora Travaglio ci dice che in realtà volevano scambiare un governo PD-M5S con l'elezione di Rodotà a PdR. Certo, l'hanno pure dichiarato (le famose ""praterie lussureggianti""), ma ti ricordi *quando* è successo? Dopo mesi in cui hanno tirato la corda così tanto che alla fine TUTTI, ma proprio TUTTI nel PD li hanno mandati a fanculo e si sono organizzati altrimenti, e io sostengo che l'abbiano fatto solo ed esclusivamente per poter dire, tra qualche mese, ""VEDETE?!

Una scritta sul web non è necessariamente una scritta sul muro. Una scritta su facebook per esempio potrebbe essere condivisa solo con gli amici. Somiglia più a dire qualcosa al tavolo di un bar. Poi magari un tuo amico ripete quello che hai detto ad altri amici. Che lo ripetono ad altri amici e così via. Bloccare questo processo equivale a bandire il passaparola &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

No. Un buon 30% degli italiani voleva proprio il PD, e sono popolo anche loro. Se poi vogliamo dire che tutti quelli che non votano 5s hanno il salame sugli occhi o come disse qualcun'altro, son dei coglioni, liberissimi, ma è il caso di rendersi conto di chi si sta citando. 

C'è gente che pur con la tristezza nel cuore, tipo me, ha votato PD per alcune persone che ne fanno parte (ed è deprimente che molti grillini facciano finta che non esistano), ad ogni modo, vedevo bene un governo PD dove l'opposizione dei 5s valesse davvero qualcosa, e nota che dico opposizione, cioè quella cosa che si fa in un governo, governo che prima deve partire. Votare la fiducia NON significa allearsi, inciuciarsi, vendersi o che. Significa accettare il voto degli altri italiani che non hanno votato per te. E avere la possibilità di essere un'opposizione costruttiva, possibilità di dialogare, di influenzare davvero la direzione del paese.  

Adesso all'opposizione... c'è il PDL. Cioè, dovrei essere contenta? Cos'ha ottenuto in soldoni il movimento? Si, politicamente han fatto i duri e puri, ma praticamente, per la gente, per i cittadini di cui si onorano di far parte, cos'hanno fatto? Come hanno aumentato la loro influenza sul governo? Come hanno dato più voce al ""popolo""?

Sul finanziamento: guarda, non è che sono necessariamente in disaccordo con te. Adesso non c'ho voglia, però una discussione su come e cosa si può fare, tenendo conto un pò di tanti fattori, per trovare una soluzione comune, non mi dispiace affatto. Ed è qua che c'è la differenza con i grillini, mai sentito un grillino dire via il finanziamento secondo me, ma mettiamoci ad un tavolo e troviamo la soluzione migliore per tutti. Oh, non è molto comune neppure tra gli altri eh, o meglio mediano di qua e di là ma purtroppo spesso badano al tornaconto personale più che al bene superiore, ed è qua che secondo me i grillini si dovevano inserire per cambiare le cose.

* severely limited access to education in languages other than Hungarian, at all levels,
* censitary electoral system, practically eliminating the mostly low-income non-Hungarians,
* direct Magyarization of names, as an official state policy.

Esempio di fresca cronaca. Stanotte [è morto](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/1dkvm3/jeff_hanneman_1964_2013_rip/) Jeff Hanneman, chitarrista degli Slayer. Domani sul Corriere ci sarà - ad andar bene - un trafiletto sul metallaro satanistico che faceva le canzoni su Mengele. Potrò incazzarmi io leggendolo? No che non potrò: perché su cento lettori del Corriere, novantanove non hanno idea di chi siano gli Slayer (peggio per loro) e il centesimo sono io, che se voglio leggere roba sugli Slayer non ho bisogno di andarla a cercare sul Corriere. In compenso, il Corriere avrà le solite otto pagine di politicazza, avrà la pagina di leggera col piastrone di foto sulla prova costume dei vip e avrà la passante sullo strapotere del calcio tedesco. Questo perché, ci piaccia o no, la gente che compra il Corriere - senza per forza essere degli ottantenni rincoglioniti che sono rimasti a Portobello - è più interessata a questa roba che agli Slayer (o ai videogiochi, per restare in tema). E siccome lo scopo del gioco è fare in modo che questa gente compri il giornale anche domani, tu devi dare a questa gente quello che questa gente vuole vedersi dare. Quindi niente videogiochi, niente metal e niente pesca sportiva, spiacente.

Das kommt drauf an worauf du hinaus willst. Was ist den das Ziel der Literaturwissenschaft? Doch nicht etwa mit ihrem ""Konsens"" zu historischen Romanen zu den Autoren zu gehen und ihnen zu erzählen wie sie ihre historischen Romane zu schreiben haben weil sie sich darauf geeinigt haben, dass ""Quo Vadis"" nach den Regeln die sie sich ausgedacht haben, perfekt ist. Sie propagieren auch nicht die Überzeugung, dass nicht nur ihr System sondern auch schon der Weg mit dem sie dazu gekommen sind der einzig vernünftige Weg ist der uns allen die besten historischen Romane bringen wird.  Sie gehen auch nicht mit diesem Konsens zu den Politikern und erzählen ihnen, dass diese gefälligst nur die Länder unterstützen sollen die diese Art von historischen Romanen veröffentlicht.

Das mag jetzt etwas überspitzt sein aber ich denke es wird klar wovon wir hier reden. Auf der einen Seite ein Fachbereich der zwar kulturellen Wert hat aber in der ""Realität"" die Relevanz von Briefmarkensammlungen hat (wie du schon sagtest). Während wir auf der anderen Seite auf einer ähnlichen (laut dir vergleichbaren) Basis einen Fachbereich haben dessen Köpfe der Meinung sind ""die Geschicke der Welt"" leiten zu können. Was ja auch grösstenteils zutreffend ist. Ein Fachbereich der nicht nur die Gestaltung der Realität auf diesem Planeten prägt sondern diese für viele auch dominiert.  
Die Absurdität und Paradoxie die dieser Fachbereich hervorgebracht hat kann man heute auf dem Markt betrachten. CDCs, PPPs, Erpressung von Staaten durch Marktmanipulationen o.ä. Das sind alles offensichtlich unmorlaische Werkzeuge des Betruges die aber durch ""Forscher"" dieses Fachbereiches zu legalen Mitteln erhoben wurden. Nicht nur das. Es sind teilweise Methoden die dem eigenen System Schaden hinzufügen und somit auch allen die daran beteiligt sind. Langfristige Konsequenzen sind nicht ausreichend wissenschaftlich (siehe Experimente) erforscht weil dies in dem Gebiet überhaupt nicht möglich ist (ausser mit einer Zeitmaschine). Trotzdem werden die Ergüsse aus dem Fachbereich genutzt um die Welt zu fahren. So etwas wäre in anderen relevanten Fachbereichen nicht möglich. Hier ist es das und es wird vom Staat gefördert.

For instance, my children were born in the USA and go to school in the USA. They take the pledge quite seriously, even though we talk mostly about European matters in our house.

true,juremes,SLOV,Slovenia,"This paper by Guy Verhofstadt is a little bit dated, but I think it illustrates very well the main possible pillars of the USE (http://www.euraction.org/committee/newsletter/Verhofstadt.pdf): 

European social-economic policy. The basis of this joint strategy is convergence, determining minimum and maximum requirements, including in areas such as social protection and taxation, to serve as the basis for the member states' future development. In this way the European economy can become competitive again without descending to social dumping. 

Research &amp; development. The 'United States of Europe' will also have to step up its efforts in the areas of research and development and the establishment of transEuropean information networks.

Justice &amp; security. Furthermore, we will need a single European area of justice and security if we are to fight crime more effectively. 

Finally, we need to set up joint armed forces and conduct a foreign policy through which Europe speaks with one voice.
...

More recent proposal I agree with in principle with comes from (LOL) the UK:

""History suggests that the current crisis requires the immediate creation of an Anglo-American style fiscal and military union of the eurozone – a ""democratic union"". This would involve the creation of a European parliament with legislative powers; a one-off federalising of all state debt through the issue of union bonds to be backed by the entire tax revenue of the common currency zone (with a debt ceiling for member states thereafter); the supervised dissolution of insolvent private-sector financial institutions; and a single European army, with a monopoly on external force projection.

This is the only solution that will enable Europeans to mobilise in pursuit of their collective interest rather than against each other, and integrate Germany economically and militarily into the larger whole, without disenfranchising the German people or any other population of the union.""

true,Ryanair,LGBT,Duisburg,"Ooookay, gut. Pass auf. Texas hold'em läuft nach dem Prinzip, dass du 2 Karten bekommst aus einem 52 Karten Deck. 

Dazu werden vom Dealer (Der Typ, der dir die Karten gibt und die Karten auf den Tisch legt) 5 Karten auf besagten Tisch gelegt. 

Bevor der Dealer aber auch nur die erste Karte ablegt, aber nachdem du deine 2 Karten von ihm bekommen hast, wird zuerst von dir festgelegt, ob du überhaupt Karten hast, die du spielen willst. 

Wenn du die Karten nicht spielen willst, legst du sie ab bzw. ""foldest"". 

Damit hast du im glücklichsten Fall kein Geld verloren. Allerdings gibt es auch den ""Small blind"". Das ist der Spieler links vom Dealer. Der muss die Hälfte des vom Dealer angegebenen ersten Einsatzes auf den Tisch legen. 

Der Spieler links vom Small Blind ist der Big blind. Der muss den vollen vom Dealer angegeben Betrag auf den Tisch legen. 

Lass uns sagen, in der ersten Runde wird vom Dealer festgelegt, dass der volle Betrag 10# sind. Wenn du links vom Dealer sitzt, musst du 5# auf den Tisch legen, bevor du überhaupt auch nur Irgendwas tun kannst. Der Typ links von dir muss dazu aber die vollen 10# auf den Tisch legen, bevor er Irgendwas tun kann.

 Ist 'nen kleiner Trick, um Spieler auch mal zum Handeln zu zwingen und keine Ewigkeit am Tisch zu verbringen. Diese ""Blinds"" steigen entweder jede Runde, also wenn jeder Spieler am Tisch im Uhrzeigersinn mal Big Blind war, oder nach einer festgelegten Zeit.

Wenn du das Glück hattest, keinen Blind legen zu müssen, kannst du dir, wie gesagt, überlegen, ob du ""foldest"", oder auf den Big Blind, das Minimum in der ersten Runde, mitgehst (Der sogenannte ""call""). Denn auch der Small Blind muss auf den Big Blind erhöhen, um in Runde 2 dieser Hand zu gelangen.

Du kannst auch in der ersten Runde schon nen ""raise"" in Angriff nehmen, was nichts Anderes bedeutet, als die #10, die vom Big Blind liegen auf z.B. 15# zu erhöhen. Jeder, der in die 2. Runde dieser Hand mitgehen will, muss nun 15# anstatt 10# auf den Tisch legen. 

""Check"" bedeutet, dass du, z.B. als Big Blind in der ersten Runde weder 'nen ""Raise"" , noch ""foldest"", also dir angucken willst, was die anderen Spieler machen. Wenn Jeder die vorher erwähnten 10# gelegt hast, und du als Big Blind ""checkst"" beginnt die 2. Runde dieser Hand. (""Hand"" im Übrigen bedeutet nichts Anderes als die Karten, die du gerade auf der Hand hast, die natürlich nach jedem Gewinn eines Spielers neu ausgeteilt werden.) 

So. Nun folgt der ""Flop"". Der Flop bedeutet, dass der Dealer die obere Karte des Decks (Die ""Burn Card"") beiseite legt und die 3 nächsten Karten darunter offen auf den Tisch legt. 

Hier bildet sich solangsam deine Hand. Natürlich kann sie sich auch schon sehr gut in der ersten Runde ausgebildet haben, wenn du zum Beispiel nen Pärchen hast, oder 2 Karten einer Farbe, oder 2 Karten, die direkt aufeinander folgen (Ich meine 7 und 8 z.b.). Es ist bei Texas hold'em, wie bei den anderen Pokervarianten Ziel des Spieles, eine der folgenden Kartenvarianten zusammen zu bekommen : 

http://www.poker-institut.org/grundlagen/rangfolge-der-pokerblatter/

Die 2 Karten auf deiner Hand haben also in der 2. Runde im Extremfall schon einen Royal flush, Straight flush, Full House, Flush, oder 4 of a kind gebildet. Damit kannst du dich natürlich ein klein wenig zurücklehnen und musst weniger ""bluffen"", als wenn du nur Müll auf der Hand hättest. 

Nachdem der Dealer den ""Flop"" gelegt hat beginnt wieder das alte Spiel mit ""Check"", ""Raise"", oder ""Fold"". Man muss NICHT raisen, jede Runde ab jetzt, bis zur letzten Aktion KANN mit dem gelegten Wert aus Runde 1 beendet werden, passiert aber in den seltensten Fällen.

Nachdem sich alle Spieler geeinigt haben, was sie tun wollen, beginnt auch schon die nächste Runde in der der Dealer wieder eine Karte beiseite legt,und die ""Turn Card"", die 4. offen liegende Karte, auf den Tisch legt. Deine Hand, oder die Hand der anderen formt sich nun immer mehr, wenn du nicht bereits tierisches Glück hattest, und natürlich beginnt auch das bluffen ernstere Züge anzunehmen. Raise, Check, Fold, wie gehabt. 

Die 5. Karte, die danach gelegt wird, nennt sich die ""River Card"". Zuerst wird wieder eine Karte beiseite gelegt, und anschließend die letzte Karte offen hingelegt. Nun beginnt die letzte Runde. Danach folgt nichts mehr, es ist also ab hier ein reines Nervenspiel voller bluffen, raisen und/oder folden. 

Am Ende, wenn jeder Spieler reihum einmal gecheckt hat, werden die Spieler aufgefordert ihre Karten offen zu zeigen, um den Gewinner zu ermitteln. Der Gewinner bekommt den ganzen angesammelten Haufen an #, der sich in der Spielmitte befindet.

Dazu kommen noch Sachen, wie ""All In"". geht ein Spieler All In, bedeutet das nichts Anderes, als dass er all seine Spielchips auf seine Hand setzt. Spieler können in dem Fall nur wählen, ob sie mitgehen, oder folden. Die genauen Sachen für Split Pots und sowas hab' ich aber nicht im Kopf. Selbst nur nen Spieler, der ab und an mal unter Freunden spielt. Wenn da Jemand Lust hat einzuspringen, wäre ich sehr dankbar. 

Aaaalso, wie gesagt, bei einem All In fällt das raisen weg und der Spielablauf wird beschleunigt. Sind Spieler in einem All In, deckt der Dealer alle Karten auf, ohne dabei vom normalen Spielablauf unterbrochen zu werden. Am Ende dieser Runde geht dann, je nach Wert der Karten alles gesetzte Geld an den Mutigen, der All In gegangen ist, oder es ist raus und seine Chips werden an die Mitgegangenen aufgeteilt.

Even if the rights and responsibilities are equal, giving separate names implies difference. And with implied difference, one will likely end up being seen as inferior. Language used is an important tool in social progress, if you are using separate terms for the same thing, then there is still segregation between groups.

I will admit that the blacks only whites only analogy was a stretch but I was merely trying to make a point.

&gt; I'm not religious, but I'd be happy to have religion owning it completely, and all of us who aren't wanting religious marriages just get civil partnerships.

First of all, a religious history does not mean it is appropriate in today's more secular society. Government should not have any religous leanings in order to remain fair. This includes the use of the legal term marriage, and that religion should not be able to claim a monopoly on it.

Regarding TV have a look at ""Phoenix Runde"" und ""Der Tag"" both on [phoenix](http://www.phoenix.de/content/phoenix/die_sendungen/sendeformate/2008)

""Runde"" is a discussion with journalists, politicians, scientists and experts (3 per week). ""Der Tag"" is studio moderated news with background analysis from a scientists/expert. 
Both cover international topics/events too. 

Several other talk shows with politicians are really bad at invited guests, journalism, moderating or a combination. (Günther Jauch, Anne Will, Hart aber Fair) 
Every workday politicians are interviewed in ""moma"" (ARD/ZDF) morning show. While they are saying something - about current news, the ""content"" is often missing. Moderators/interviewers are generally weak from an investigative perspektive.

true,flyingorange,VOJV,Vojvodina,"I was in Gaziantep a couple of years ago and visited a museum which showed scenes from 1919. The French and the Arabs wanted to conquer the city so it would become part of Syria, on the other hand you had the Turks (not sure if Ataturk was involved in that battle). After a fierce resistance the French eventually won and took over the city. However, because later in that year Ataturk won victories on other fronts and the French saw how difficult it was for them to capture Gaziantep in the first place, which still had a hostile population, they eventually gave it back to the Turks.

Now imagine if the Romanians wanted to take over for example Marosvasarhely, a 99% Hungarian place, and the population had actually resisted? That didn't happen, and actually such resistance never happened anywhere. Like I said, not even the commies couldn't find enough volunteers to fight when the Romanians were already on the Tisza shores. 

The future borders were *not* decided because Romania surrendered to the Axis and so it violated its agreement with the Entente. The Hungarian-Romanian war is a completely separate issue from WW1, where the Romanians conquered Hungary without any resistence. Hungary had perhaps 2 million conscripted ethnic Hungarians just months before the Romanians crossed the Carpathians, and all those people vanished into thin air and weren't willing to defend their homes. In fact I believe that many of them believed the worker's revolution was around the corners and nations won't matter anymore. This is why they got defeated by some 100-150 thousand Romanian infantrymen.

Hungarian historiography really should be revisioned to include more details about this war and the attitude of the people, instead of blaming it all on the Entente. Perhaps some side-notes should be added comparing how the Turks didn't fuck up while in the same situation.

Basically, they're hired as contractors who work for other companies like Monster and so they don't get the benefits of full-time employees. Also, there's so many desperate people in the villages that they always find a fresh supply and they never run out of employees. They require little to no training (for assembly, they're often shown how to do it only once) so it's cheaper for the companies to find loyal people who are willing to work hard than to waste their time training someone. These people don't get to have their voice heard because it would be suicide for the media to publish their complaints.

It's not normal to be asked to make a choice between working 12hrs/day for a few days (which turns into weeks or months) and losing your job. It's not normal to not get compensation for mandatory extra time you put in, because fuck you. It's not normal to get a pay cut if you fuck up without being given the chance to fix things. It's not normal to be promised bonuses and not get them.

These companies have such a profit that they actually prefer being sued every once in a while than to give proper working conditions. The lawsuits are so rare that it's more cost-effective to go to court, because people are desperate to make a buck and will take any job they're being offered for minimum wage. When you have the choice between selling your soul for a couple hundred bucks a month and starving, believe me, you take the first one.

Funny how they're not selling any loss-making enterprises though. The state has taken the train company's debts to itself and now it's profitable. OPAP was profitable. The water companies are profitable. Don't delude yourself that unprofitable companies would be sold. 

&gt; In the case of Greece both corruption and clientelism is the basis for the crisis. If it had not been for greek politicians falsifying statistiscs for years and bying votes with government jobs the crisis would not have been as bad as it is. This goes for education and statistics as well.

I do think these factors played a significant for the state of Greek society but I do not think they were ""the basis for the crisis"". Falsifying statistics was not unique or even exceptional in Europe; all countries did it to pretty ridiculous degrees. Buying votes with government jobs does not hurt the economy, it hurts fairness. As long as the number of government jobs is no more than it should be (and it was on par with other EU countries) it's not a problem for the budget. 

&gt; I mean greece have more teachers/student than any other EU country but at the same time some of the worst results, why? Because the teachers themselvs hold after school classes to get additional cash. This because the unions are so strong that it can't be changed.

You are jumping to conclusions. There could be a million reasons why Greece does not have good enough educational results even after having a high teacher-to-student ratio. It could be the teacher wages. It could be the teaching materials. It could be the school infrastructure. It could be the teaching system chosen. It could have to do with parental involvement. But no, you just take the conclusion you prefer for ideological reasons and run with it. 

&gt; As for checks and balances, it was only after 2010 the ELSTAT got independence from the parliament. To throw mony at stuff like this won't change it.


&gt; In order to end the fradulent practices you need to get to the root cause i.e vested intrests and political families. If these are allowed to throw around more money they simply won't change. 

We agree. Throwing money at problems does not help particularly. But that was my point in the first place: if withdrawing or throwing money at the Greek economy/government does not fix the problems we all hate, then why have the people suffer needlessly? Having the people suffer through the worst depression since the 30s does not solve vested interests or political families. We need to decouple the economic problem from the institutional problem and apply different solutions to each.

Wissenschaftler und schon gar nicht Lehrer sollten ihre Zeit damit verschwenden so einen Schwachsinn zu widerlegen.

&gt;Ich habe einige Paper beider Seiten gelesen/lesen müssen, da ich aber kein Klimaforscher bin, wage ich hier auch keine Beurteilung; aber ich habe auch nicht den Eindruck gewonnen, dass hier bereits alle Argumente - seien sie nun gut oder schlecht - ausreichend erörtert wurden.

Die Frage ob es einen anthropogenen Einfluss auf das Klima gibt kann ohne begründeten Zweifel mit ""Ja"" beantwortet werden. Es gibt bestimmt noch einige Details, die erörtert werden müssen, aber der Schwachsinn, der von Interessengruppen finanzierten Skeptikern verbreitet wird, gehört nicht dazu.

**Legend:**

* **purple** (Central, Northern and Eastern Europe + Greece) - ultimately from Medieval Greek ""[angourion](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gherkin&amp;allowed_in_frame=0)"". Greek is from a word for ""immature"" and the vegetable originated in northern India and came to Eastern Europe via the Byzantine Empire.- [etymonline](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gherkin&amp;allowed_in_frame=0)).

* **orange** ""cucumber"" (Western Europe) - from Latin ""[cucumerem](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cucumber&amp;allowed_in_frame=0)"" (nominative ""cucumis""), perhaps from a pre-Italic Mediterranean language.

* **light green** ""krastavica"" (Balkans) - from Slavonic ""krastavŭ"" - ""[scaby](http://dexonline.ro/definitie/castravete/429085)"" via Bulgarian ""krástavica"" probably refering to the aspect of its skin.

* **dark green** ""hiyar"" (Muslim countries) - from the Persian ""[xiyâr](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AE%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B1#Persian)"" from Middle Persian ""xyār"". 

* **orangered** ""pepino"" (Portuguese &amp; Spanish) a diminutive of Latin ""[pepo](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pepo)"" (melon, pumpkin), in turn from the Ancient Greek πέπων (pepōn)

* **light blue** ""cetriolo"" (Italian) - from the Latin word ""[citrium](http://www.myetymology.com/italian/cetriolo.html)"" (kind of gourd) via the Latin ""[citriolum](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cetriolo#Italian)""

* **magenta** ""cularan"" (Scottish Gaelic) - [earth nut](http://www.ceantar.org/Dicts/MB2/mb12.html)

* **red** ""kornischong"" (Luxemburg) - from the French ""cornichon"" (mening ""gherkin""), a diminutive of ""[corne](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corne#French)"" meaning ""horn"", which in turn comes from Latin.

* **pink** ""varung"" (Armenia) - An [Iranian borrowing](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D5%BE%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B6%D5%A3) from Middle Persian  (vātrang),  (vātrēng), Persian (bādrang, “a species of cucumber; an orange”), (vārang, “a long crooked cucumber; a large lemon or orange-tree”).

I don't think multiculturalism is something we should be aiming for as an end point, but as more of a transitionary arrangement which occurs for each individual, or group of immigrants, as each generation moves towards mainstream society. If, for instance, a British guy marries a Chinese girl, and they live in Britain, I'm in favour of multiculturalism to the extent that the girl is treated with utmost dignity and respect as someone who grew up, and spent the majority of her life abroad: we do not try to make her artificially British overnight, waving little plastic flags, and abandoning her childhood culture. The expectation would then be that the children in that situation will be brought up within British culture and society, but with Chinese cultural influences.

I agree with the concept of net migration targets, because not only does it keep in check the stress on resources (schools, housing, healthcare etc), but it also gives society a greater opportunity to integrate people into a common culture, and means there's more space for individuals to find their way through the issues, with less pressure from the rest of society.

Those areas become so concentrated as a result of them not wanting to integrate, despite every incentive to do so.

I doubt you really do. Few people who say they hate nationalism realize it means more than a couple of neo-nazi's chanting at demonstrations. SNP is nationalistic, as was most of the old party platform's people tend to long for nowadays.

Aber Leute, die für ein paar Monate einen Verwandten in einem Minijob tatsächlich beschäftigt haben, haben für meinen Geschmack nichts falsch gemacht. 

Klar, sie dürfen dabei nicht gegen Gesetze verstoßen.
