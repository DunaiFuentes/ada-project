Just taking a GPS with a chip for European roads and driving (yes, driving) the by-ways to criss-cross Germany was phenomenal. The small cities and rolling landscape are just beautiful to see, especially when you don't really know what to expect around the next turn.  hint: its probably a round-a-bout. Comparing architectural/housing styles across the regions was interesting.

In 2 weeks you could easily see Heidelberg, Freiburg, bits of Munich (including Dachau, der platz und residenz), Rothenburg, Mannheim castle was gorgeous, the alps and Neuschwanstein, Bodensee (Lake Konstanz/Constance), plus LOTS of other things. It might be touristy, but Baden-Baden spa for a day was worth the money. 

You can't ""live"" in each city for days if only there for a few weeks, but you can go get the gist and fall in love with Germany. :)

Our favorites are Rothenburg ob der tauber, Freiburg, Heidelberg city &amp; castle (pay for the tour), and the Alps. That view as you drive into the alps, OMG! 

Our German friends said the castle (Neuschwanstein) is kind of the tourist thing to do, but worth seeing, so we did. and yes, it was.  recommend buying tickets online in advance, lines were long. Pay to ride the carriage up too, they say 15-20 minutes to walk up, took our group 45.

Try not to speed through seeing everything, you will lessen the experience - if you know what I mean.  Have as many meals outside as you can, especially in the platz . Nothing beats relaxed 2-3 hour meals, knowing it's wrong to pressure the waitress to be ""American"" and go fast, so you actually sit there and enjoy your surroundings.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; ""as for people to be holding savings you need someone to be holding the corresponding debt"" I kinda need explaining s of this because I dont understand it

The Euro comes into existence when someone borrows money. That's where it comes from - the ECB loans money to banks via refinancing operations, those banks loan to people, and that's how the Euro enters circulation.

What this means is that if you have positive net savings, let's say €1000, the rest of the economy owes €1000. So for you to have savings, *someone* has to be holding the corresponding debt. This is a large part of what gives fiat worth - when someone borrows it into existence they're creating an obligation on themselves to pay it back at a later date.

&gt; ""Those governments then impose austerity measures trying to stop households from saving"" I dont see this as a true or logical statement.

If households/businesses en masse attempt to save in Euros, there's only two places Euros can come for them to achieve this: other nations, or the government. That's it. For the households/businesses of a nation to save in Euros *someone* must dissave in Euros, either another nation or the government.

If they fail to extract from those two sources what they desire to save, they'll save at the expense of one another. This is known as the [paradox of thrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift), that when households withdraw spending incomes fall (for in an economy one person's spending is another's income), meaning that jobs and real output collapse. Those with the most secure jobs save at the expense of those with less secure jobs.

If the nation runs a trade surplus they bring in more Euros than they send out (ie they save at the expense of other nations) but now there must be a nation losing its savings. It's zero sum, in aggregate nations cannot save via exporting - those with the strongest export sectors will be able to (ie Germany) but those with the least (ie Greece) will be losing savings.

That leaves just the government. Now with so much of the government's budget out of its control (see [automatic stabilisers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_stabilizer)) this tends to happen automatically - the government supplies more savings when households desire them, and absorbs more when people are spending (ie when income/consumption taxes are higher).

 The problem is, in the Euro zone governments are limited in how much they can borrow according to their revenue. This is not the case in currency-issuing nations - the frugal risk-adverse Japanese have been granted *immense* savings by the Japanese government. The USA has provided the rest of the world with a huge amount of USD in savings (ie many nations have huge USD reserves) by its own government going into debt.

But the EMU? There's not one entity that can supply people with savings. There they're stuck - households, businesses, governments and all nations are trying to save simultaneously - yet according to [sectoral balances](http://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2011/03/should-the-us-balance-its-budget/) (an accounting identity) this is impossible. This was either not a scenario ever considered when the EMU was formed, or if it was it was pushed to one side as an obstruction to the vision and ignored. It's a disaster though - this inability for anyone to supply savings leading to insufficient spending for high employment is what is sending nations backwards today.",0,1366590948,null,0,false,0,c9jxuv8,t3_1cqfe0,t1_c9jxuv8,t1_c9jmvqz,null,1431475489,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
true,HappyReaper,null,null,"&gt; A severe problem in Europe is immigrant crime.

A severe problem is crime, period. Societies should punish it as consistently as possible without trying to drag innocent people into it, for sharing arbitrary attributes with the perpetrators. If people from a given background, be it ethnic, economical, cultural, or otherwise, are more likely to commit crimes, then they will be punished more often. Nothing wrong with that as long as it is just the individuals doing it.

&gt; The biggest cancer we tolerate is the foreign culture fetishism of people like yourself that erode our western values in extremely regressive ways.

Nice Ad hominem. The culture of a country at any given moment is two things: culture is the collection of traditions, languages, ways of thinking and of perceiving the world, from every person living at a place; culture is also the record of what the previous elements were at every point in the past, and its physical testimony in form of art, written knowledge, and technology (even if this last one is sometimes difficult to think of as culture).

The second is past and as such is fixed; it can only be attacked through destroying its physical evidence. I'll assume you are referring to the first. You can't destroy western culture. Culture (as an aggregate) can evolve in ways you might like or dislike, but it will always be a reflection of the human beings present in an area. When talking about multiculturalism, no one is asking locals to change their personal fraction of culture.

&gt; Education leads to taking a hard look at foreign cultures and treating them more objectively thus the xenophobia. Multicultists like yourself operate entirely on your feelings.

False generalization. Both proponents of multiculturalism and xenophobia, support their views through varying proportions of personal principles and actual data. Actually, it is often the case that higher education brings down xenophobia indexes **(1)**.

&gt; That's just the basis of a proper immigration policy. That's not even a xenophobic argument like the deportation debates.

It is very important to make a distinction between respecting the laws of the host country and adopting local traditions and views for oneself. It is vital for immigrants (as well as for locals) to fit in the legislative framework in place where they live; for that, they may need to sacrifice some customs and habits, and it's hard to argue against that. However, as long as laws are respected (if they are not, then we are in point one of this comment), then every human being living in a country is free to live however they want to live, even if that implies a lack of integration with their neighbours' lifestyles.

Usually the words ""*integrate*"" and ""*assimilate*"" are used in order to imply some kind of obligation for immigrants to change their lifestyle further than what the laws require. That might be welcomed, but it is not an obligation.

&gt; The notion that it's something to cure is silly in the extreme and paints a much worse picture of yourself than you think.

What a desirable society is, is a subjective concept, and there is no absolute truth to it. However, for those of us who think that xenophobia is noxious for society, advocating that countries should make an effort to remove it is not a silly concept.

&gt; It's neither a clumsy argument nor is that the definition of fascism.

Again, there is no truth to what a ""good"" society is. Saying that a culture is worse than other is not clumsy if you are just stating your opinion, but it is if you are trying to discuss matters objectively.

About fascism, you are right in that the doctrine can not be reduced to that statement. There's some correlation, as it is a key component to [Chauvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvinism), which is one of the pillars of [Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism). Still, it's perfectly possible for one to be xenophobic without being neither chauvinistic nor fascist.

&gt; Rarely and never as well-supported as the practices themselves are within the immigrant populations. If you check their funding sources you'll see as much.

This should be judged on a case-per-case basis. Personally, I don't care who does those things more or who did them first. Whatever the case is, authorities have the responsibility to prosecute and punish the perpetrators accordingly and consistently, be them of a local or immigrant origin. Same as with any other crime.

&gt; As was the case before they were ever allowed into Europe to begin with. Traders brought back ideas and products without their originators settling down.

True. Local populations having access to foreign culture and immigration are different phenomenons, and as such should be assessed separately. 

However, it also shows how some foreign cultural traits are indeed perfectly compatible with local society. Of course, others are not, and those are the ones xenophobia tends to focus on. In my opinion, for societies with strong differentiated cultural subgroups (it doesn't matter if some are foreign in origin or all are local) to reduce their internal cultural clash, the strategy to follow is:

* Make an emphasis on both common and compatible cultural traits so they work as a social lubricant and favor empathy between members of the different collectives.

* Be sure that the non-compatible traits that are harmful for people (for instance, those that stand in opposition to human rights) fall out of the legal framework, and are prosecuted and punished consistently.

* Leave the non-compatible, non-harmful elements alone. Prosecuting and punishing them will only exacerbate the social conflict.

Multiculturalism is very viable if approached in the right way.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hallo, vorneweg: YMMV und mein Post war so ein ""angetrunken aus dem Bauch heraus etwas auf Reddit pöbeln"". Ich versuche es trotzdem einmal:

Der [Wikipedia Artikel zum Cicero](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero_\(Zeitschrift\)#Geschichte) sagt er wurde als ""deutschspachiger New Yorker"" konzipiert. Daher hatte ich den Vergleich. 

Ich lese weder Cicero oft, noch den New Yorker. Ich habe eben mal im Politik-Teil vom New Yorker auf einen [Artikel zur Schuldenkrise](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2013/04/margaret-thatcher-and-the-crumbling-case-for-austerity-economics.html) geklickt. Der Cicero Artikel erschien in Solon, im New Yorker es ist der Artikel ein Blog Beitrag. Also beides politische Meinung. Kann man vermutlich vergleichen. 

Was als erstes auffällt: Der Cicero Artikel kennt und nennt die Antwort schon in der Kopfzeile. Das macht der New Yorker auch aber nicht so explizit. 

Erster Absatz: Der New Yorker fasst mit vertiefenden Links die Geschichte zusammen, Urteilt hier auch, aber begründet es. 

Der Cicero Artikel stellt im ersten Absatz viele Behauptungen auf ohne diese zu begründen: ""Singuläre Geltung von Moral"". 

Ich bin zu faul/müde/unfähig hier noch eine Textanalyse hinzulegen, aber nach 2-3 Absätzen fühle ich beim New Yorker Artikel informiert und kann mir weitere Themen erschließen über die ich mehr lernen könnte. Beim Cicero wird mir grad erzählt, dass Hartz IV ja kein Elend verursacht und ruhig etwas härter sein könnte.. wait.. es ging doch um Moral? Ach ja.. Moral wurde gar nicht eingeordnet oder erklärt. Es ist dieses nebulös schlechte Ding. Zudem wird immer abstrakt vom Zorn und Empörung der anderen gesprochen ohne das bislang (nach 2-3 Absätzen) zu konkretisieren. 

Ok, ich lese weiter, beim New Yorker wird mir erklärt was die Studie macht und jetzt widerlegt wurde.. im Cicero lese ich dagegen gerade:

""Allein die Verbohrtheit und der Radikalismus, mit dem insbesondere in linksliberalen und alternativen Milieus einem rigiden Moralismus gehuldigt wird, erinnert verdächtig an die Verblendung, mit der schon Opa und Oma an ihr damaliges Wertesystem geglaubt haben.""

sind jetzt Linke Nazis? .. ok, der Artikel an sich nicht wichtig. Der Unterschied den ich mir einbilde ist dahingehend, dass der New Yorker versucht mich zu bilden. Mir einen Zusammenhang zu erklären. Der Cicero Artikel pöbelt bislang herum. Die Kritik des Autors ist sicher interessant, aber eigentlich will ich gar nicht lesen, weil der Schaum vor seinen Mund mir schon ins Gesicht spitzt. Zudem habe ich bislang wenig konkretes gelesen, nur dass die bösen Linken mit ihrer Moral, ein wenig wie Nazis sind.

Gut, ich lese weiter... nächster Absatz (volles Zitat, weil es so schön ist):

""Vielmehr haben wir es hier mit dem Produkt eines kulturellen Umformungsprozessen zu tun, der in der Aufklärung seinen Anfang nahm und bis in unsere Gegenwart – leider – noch nicht abgeschlossen ist: der Säkularisierung. In ihrer Folge wurden Werte, Normen und Regeln nicht länger aus religiösen Dogmen abgeleitet, sondern aus Normierungsinstanzen, die in der Lage waren, die normierende Funktion der Religion ebenso zu ersetzen wie den Glauben an höhere Sinnzusammenhänge. Typische Kandidaten hierfür waren im 19. Jahrhundert die Nation, das Volk, die Klasse und die Kultur""

Gut, die Linken denken wie Nazis und schuld ist aber eigentlich die Abkehr von der Religion. Puh. Steile Thesen. Aber wieder nur nebulöse Anknüpfungen an schwammige Begriffe, Kultur, Volk, Klasse. 

Dann schreibt er dass wir uns doch endlich Säkularisieren sollen. Und Rational/Technisch argumentieren. Ich muss an Tempo 120 denken, das hat die Statistik auf seiner Seite. 

Ich weiß immer noch nicht so recht, was er mit Moral meint, der Artikel suggeriert es gäbe keine technische und inhaltliche Debatte (zumindest zur Atomenergie gibt es die durchaus, zu Harz-IV liest man auch viele Sachliche und inhaltlich fundierte Kritiken). 

Sprich: Ich fühle mich dümmer als vorher, bin irgendwie irritiert und habe nichts neues gelernt, außer das die da wie Hitler sind und überhaupt früher war alles besser und wir sollten es dennoch ganz anders machen. 

Der New Yorker hat mich an die Hand genommen und ich verstehe (bilde mir ein zu verstehen :) wie ein viel diskutiertes Ökonomisches Papier fehlerhaft war und welche Folgen sich dafür für die Weltwirtschaft ergeben. 

Gegenbeispiele lassen sich sicherlich auch finden, aber tendenziell lese ich in konservativen/bürgerlichen Medien aus Deutschland mehr Artikel wie dieser im Cicero die mir erzählen wie ich gefälligst zu denken habe. Im New Yorker habe ich eher das Gefühl mitgenommen  und herumgeführt 
zu werden. Letztes finde ich deutlich angenehmer. 


Ich hoffe es ist etwas klarer...

You just may not use the things you heard for your personal purposes (like for example insurance lawyers showing up on the scene of an accident) or relay it to anyone else.

For people authorized to use the system, it's against regulations to participate in the radio traffic traffic without checking in with the authority in charge of the channel they're using (for example county dispatch), which is impossible using a scanner, because it doesn't have the ability to send. (listening counts as participating in the radio traffic)  Personal radios and callsigns are only issued to people who need them because of their position. Most radios and callsigns are bound to a vehicle. That's why using a scanner for German volunteer emergency responders is technically illegal. But it's not like someone is going around checking if you don't use one anyway.

The regulations date back to the cold war when everything concerning official radio networks was considered super secret, so they might be a bit over the top, but as we use to say, it's no eaten as hot as it's cooked.

Bart leader of said party then criticized the king for meddling with politics during the long gov. formation and by throwing his own political opinion out there which is not the job of a king (and also for getting certain tax benefits and such).

edit: Either way there never was any real equivalent of the Oranjekoords in the Netherlands.   Good reasons for this could be due to king Leopold 2 being [responsible for one of the biggest genocides in human history](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongo-Vrijstaat) and and [Leopold3 being seen as a collaborator with the Germans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_III_of_Belgium#Surrender_and_constitutional_crisis).

true,thatfool,EURO,European Union,"A ban isn't really seen as a solution. The population in general isn't too fond of the NPD so suggesting a ban wins you votes. But the discussion has been going on for decades and currently it looks like it's going nowhere. The Bundesrat (Federal Council, basically ~upper house/senate/etc.) has decided to get another attempt at banning them started, but after delaying the entire thing for a few months, the federal government refused to join them last month. The constitutional court has previously made it clear that they are going to refuse the case again if they don't get significantly better data than last time, and it's very likely going to take a few years until we actually see any new developments. And until that time, we'll continue to have this discussion.

Precisely nobody (in politics) thinks a ban would solve anything. The majority of German politicians are scared of a ban because, legally, this is a very grey area and it's possible that the constitutional court could rule against a ban and thereby accidentally validate the NPD as ""flawless democrats"". The previous (2001) attempt to get it banned already failed because the constitutional court decided that too many operatives of the Verfassungsschutz (one of Germany's intelligence agencies) held leading positions in it, and were actually *quoted as proof* of unconstitutional ideas among the party's leadership. The parties behind the ban attempt narrowly dodged a bullet there, because the constitutional court refused to accept the case instead of actually accepting it and ruling in favour of the NPD. 

It's also generally understood that making the NPD illegal will not remove Nazis from Germany and that dealing with an NPD that operates in secrecy will be harder. People don't want to get the NPD banned to make anything easier, they want to get it banned because they think a Nazi party should not be a thing in Germany.

Note that while the NPD clearly likes to associate itself with Nazi ideology, their official political positions aren't as clearly unconstitutional as those of the other two parties that *have* been banned in Germany in the past. One of them was the SRP (Socialist Party of the Reich), basically an NSDAP with a new name that didn't want to kill the Jews anymore but still officially thought they were a problem - and yes, they had ""Reich"" in their name. The other one was the KPD (Communist Party), which openly called for revolution against the ""Adenauer regime"". In contrast, the NPD is, as far as their public statements go, extremely nationalist but still a democratic party. If you take their program at face value, they want Germany to be a German nation state with traditional family values and that's basically it. So to get them banned, it's necessary to show that what they say openly isn't what they mean. Unlike the SRP or the KPD, one can't just point at their official program.

Due correzioni scorrette esigono a gran voce che si intervenga in veste di odiatissimo crociato grammaticale.

Primo punto: *po'* in luogo di poco è una delle poche eccezioni alla regola del *troncamento*. Per informazione generale: il troncamento (o apocope, per chi si atteggia :p) è la soppressione della sillaba o del fonema finale di una parola. Avviene per motivi fonetici (far suonare meglio una frase) o linguistici (evoluzione del termine stigmatizzata nella grammatica per l'uso invalso). E generalmente non vuole *mai* l'apostrofo (o apice). Eccezioni eccellenti sono (appunto) po' per poco, mo' per modo e tutte quelle forme che prive di segni grafici darebbero luogo a confusione: da' come imperativo di dare, sta' come imperativo di stare ecc.

""l'italiano"" invece è grammaticalmente *elisione*, non troncamento. Qui la regola impone sempre la presenza dell'apostrofo per segnalare la caduta (elidere=annullare, rimuovere, cancellare) di una *vocale* e solo una vocale (non sillabe) alla fine di una parola. Regole per distinguere elisione e troncamento: 1.uso dell'apostrofo; 2. separazioni grafica - mediante l'uso di uno spazio - tra parola tronca e parola seguente, cosa che non avviene mai per l'elisione; 3. Caduta di una sola singola vocale in un caso, caduta di sillabe/fonemi nell'altro.

Ricapitolando: *po'* è stato correttamente individuato come troncamento. Ma la regola è che le parole tronche (buon, gran, ...) non richiedono l'apostrofo. *l'italiano* è stato erroneamente catalogato come troncamento, trattasi bensì di elisione. Un fenomeno completanente diverso.


Secondo appunto (lieve): gli aggettivi di nazionalità in italiano, non richiedono l'iniziale maiuscola (a differenza dell'inglese) qualora si riferiscano a popoli e nazioni contemporanei. Richiedono (o comunque è accettata) l'iniziale maiuscola, gli aggettivi di nazionalità riferiti a popoli o nazioni *storici*. Dunque si ha: ""non mi abitueró mai al traffico romano"" ma ""Catone Uticense fu l'ultimo vero Romano"".

E infine un ripasso rapido sui tempi dell'infingardissimo congiuntivo: ""possa aiutarmi"" è congiuntivo *presente* non trapassato. Utile promemoria:

- cong. presente: io possa (aiutare)
- cong. passato: io abbia potuto (aiutare)
- cong. imperfetto: io potessi (aiutare)
- cong. trapassato: io avessi potuto (aiutare)

Capisco dove *possa essere stato* tratto in inganno /u/Aines/ e puntializzeró: i verbi ""potere"", ""sapere"", ""dovere"", ""volere"" e compagnia bella sono cosiddetti verbi *servili* o modali, il cui uso è grammaticalmente affine a quello dei verbi ausiliari (essere e avere), con la differenza che il verbo da loro retto va sempre all'infinito (presente o passato). Il verbo da coniugare è sempre il servile. Ecco perché ""possa aiutare"" è un congiuntivo presente, così come ""possa essere aiutato"" è un congiuntivo presente.

Comme cela a été dit, le domaine social évoqué ici renvoie au droit du travail.
  
Il a également été avancé que le projet de loi du mariage pour tous remettrait en cause un principe fondamental du droit au mariage qui est compris comme l’union d’un homme et d’une femme. Du coup l'opposition a menacé de saisir le Conseil Constitutionnel, qui pourrait éventuellement reconnaitre l'union d'un homme et d'une femme comme un principe fondamental reconnu par les lois de la République. Ce sont des catégorie de principes présents dans le préambule de la Constitution de 1946, qui a valeur constitutionnelle depuis une décision du Conseil Constitutionnel de 1971. Le préambule n’explicite par ses principes, qui sont en fait exprimés par les juges. Le mariage d’un homme et d’une femme n’a encore jamais été reconnu ni par le Conseil d’Etat ni le Conseil Constitutionnel. L'idée serait de faire en sorte que le Conseil Constitutionnel dégage ce principe et dans ce cas il y aurait possibilité de censurer le projet. Un principe fondamental est reconnu par le juge si le principe prend appui dans une législation antérieure à 1946. Le principe doit aussi avoir été reconnu par la loi de façon continue, il ne saurait y avoir une seule exception à ce principe. S’il a été tempéré ou a subi une dérogation, le principe n’existe pas. Enfin il doit s'agir d’une législation républicaine. 

En effet, le Code civil de 1804 a valeur républicaine puisqu’il est créé juste avant le Premier Empire et le principe du mariage n’a jamais subi d’exception. Toutes les conditions sont réunies pour que le Conseil Constitutionnel reconnaisse un principe fondamental de la République. Mais deux autres éléments sont à prendre en considération. Lorsqu’un juge dégage un principe fondamental reconnu par les lois de la République, le juge le fait pour garantir des libertés et des droits. Il s’oppose à un texte de lois pour préserver les libertés. Or la reconnaissance du mariage pour tous n’enlève rien à la liberté de mariage. De plus, depuis sa décision du 15 janvier 1975, le Conseil Constitutionnel s’est toujours refusé à se prononcer sur des questions de société. Le juge considère qu’il n’a pas à formater les questions de société et qu'elles dépendent de la seule appréciation du législateur. Le juge constitutionnel ne saurait dicter les mœurs d'une société, auquel cas on sombrerait dans le gouvernement des juges...

Dernier point, déjà évoqué, la solution du ""référendum d'initiative populaire"" (il s'agit enfait d'un référendum minoritaire d'initiative partagée) qui aurait éventuellement pu permettre un référendum. Mais l'ancienne majorité UMP n'a pas pris la peine de voter une loi organique qui mettrait en place un tel référendum, il est donc inutilisable. Ironie du sort.

LONDON--The combined budget deficit of the euro zone's 17 governments fell in 2012, while their debts rose relative to the currency area's annual economic output.

Figures released by the European Union's statistics agency Monday show some of the austerity programs pursued by euro-zone governments succeeded in narrowing the gap between their revenues and spending, even as the currency area's economy contracted.

But nations that began the year with wide gaps between spending and revenue and pursued the most aggressive austerity programs were the least successful in narrowing their deficits.

Eurostat said the combined budget deficits of euro-zone members were equivalent to 3.7% of gross domestic product in 2012, down from 4.2% of GDP in 2011 and 6.2% of GDP in 2010.

The fresh borrowing needed to finance those deficits led to a rise in combined government debt to 90.6% of GDP from 87.3% in 2012.

There were very large differences between the budget positions of individual members. Germany had a small budget surplus, while Spain's deficit rose to 10.6% of GDP from 9.4%, the highest in the euro zone.

However, that increase largely reflected the cost of bailing out the nation's banks, which was roughly equivalent to 4% of GDP.

But other nations struggling to repair their public finances also saw their deficits widen. In Greece, the deficit rose to 10.0% of GDP from 9.5% in 2011, while in Portugal, the deficit widened to 6.4% of GDP from 4.4% of GDP.

Of the four countries that have received financial help from the rest of the euro zone, only Ireland recorded a decline in its deficit, to 7.6% of GDP from 13.4% in 2011. Under its bailout program with the EU and International Monetary Fund, the government had aimed to cut the deficit to 8.6% of GDP.

Cyprus is likely to be the fifth euro-zone member to receive bailout loans, and its budget deficit was unchanged at 6.3% of GDP in 2012, slightly higher than earlier estimates.

In Slovenia, which has said it does not need a bailout to help rescue its troubled banks, the deficit fell to 4.0% from 6.4% in 2011. Slovenia's statistic agency had previously estimated the deficit at 3.7% of GDP.

Outside the euro zone, Hungary had a deficit of 1.9% in 2012, well below the 3% threshold mandated by EU budget rules.

Sehr geehrter Herr ….,
Im vorherigen Monat haben Sie mir mitgeteilt, dass Sie mich gern von Oktober 2013 bis März 2014 als Praktikant in …. haben möchten. Sie haben mich gefragt, ob ich noch Student bin und ich habe Ihnen gesagt, dass ich am liebsten im Leonardo da Vinci Programm bei Ihnen arbeiten würde.
Ich schreibe diese Mail um Ihnen mitzuteilen, dass ich, falls Sie das Leonardo da Vinci Programm nicht erwägen können, noch ein Jahr studieren will, sodass ich doch als Student ein Praktikum in Ihrer Abteilung machen kann. Ich hoffe sehr, dass Ihr Angebot noch gilt und freue mich darauf von Ihnen zu hören.
Mit herzlichem Dank und freundlichen Grüßen, ………

D'une part, quand tu pars dans un autre pays, tu as des efforts à faire, tes enfants auront des efforts à faire. C'est la règle du jeu et c'est pas comme si c'était plus facile d'être à l'école au Mali. D'autre part, on oublie très souvent de dire que les familles d'étrangers et d'immigrés ont beaucoup plus d'enfants que les ""de souche"" ([en 2008 : 1,7 enfant par femme pour les ""de souche"" contre 3,3 pour les étrangers et 4,3 pour les africaines](http://www.nationspresse.info/la-realite-du-taux-de-fecondite-en-france-depuis-10-ans/)). Du coup, ça ne facilite pas l'éducation.

Si c'est une question d'inégalité scolaire, [la question plus complexe qu'il n'y parait](http://www.inegalites.fr/spip.php?article1458), et il faut distinguer les filles des garçons.

En effet, les garçons doivent faire beaucoup plus d'efforts que les filles pour avoir les mêmes résultats scolaires. Par ailleurs, à classe sociale égale, les immigrés réussissent mieux que les ""de souche"".

Après, il y a évidemment le concept de [capital culturel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ4ru3tOEFM), qui explique de plus en plus la reproduction sociale. Mais les familles immigrées accumulent les problèmes, ce n'est donc pas seulement une question d'éducation, mais aussi de comportement.

If you play on teams you combine the hands with your partner.

Like say you and I are playing together, if either of our hand beats our opponents we win the round. And then we add the points from your hand and mine, even if my hand alone would lose.

Minimum bet is 2, but there is no maximum so you can bet any odd number as well. One member of the team gets the individual points (""amarracos""), whenever he has 5 points he puts them back to the center and his partner gets one bean, which has 5 points value. (One will always have 1 value beans, the other one will always have 5)

&gt;And seriously, what's with the changing 2 and 3 cards which can alternate between being their face value, respectively an ace or king, and respectively a 1 or 10?

Sorry I didn't understand that sentence, could you rephrase that?

Most basic steps:

Grande - Highest card wins

Chica - Lowest card wins

Pares - Pair is lowest value, then three of a kind, then two pair is highest value(opposite of poker).

Juego - As you said, 31 - 32 - 40 until 33. 

If everyone has under 31 then you play Al punto, whoever is closest to 30.

So they can't admit what they're doing is against the Constitution- they have to twist words to seem in line with the Constitution.  Now, I personally think the cult of the Constitution has gone overboard here, but that's how it works. I don't see why we don't tweak it more often, so I guess your situation would actually be an improvement in a lot of ways! 

Plus, there is nothing simple about the system.  I don't know too much about the governing system in Germany, so is there a German form of [Checks and Balances](http://www.socialstudieshelp.com/lesson_13_notes.htm)?  I imagine there is something comparable.

Then, like /u/TheHiccup said, the Supreme court can declare a law unconstitutional.  If you've heard about the whole LGBT case here recently in the US about prop-8 (I don't know how big that was internationally) that was the Supreme Court deciding on the constitutionality of the California bill.  

If there's one thing the most similar to what you said, it's the Supreme court.

Si on ne veut pas passer l'oeuvre qu'on ne la passe pas, et puis c'est tout.

erstmal danke für die ausführliche Analyse, sehr intressant. Cicero hab ich zwar als Zeitungsnamen des öfteren gehört, aber untergekommen wär mir das Blatt hier in AT bislang nicht.

Die Auswahl beschränkt sich derzeit ja hauptsächlich auf Boulevard-lastige-Blah Blah Blätter (So punkt punkt punkted Österreich! Lesen Sie hier was sie eh schon immer hören wollten!) und den ""Alternativen"" die extrem weit links stehen und auch vor allem predigen (Der Falter zB).

Was mir bei deinen Cicero Quotes ein wenig aufstößt ist Sprache. Es klingt so hochgestochen und ""über schlau"" dass es bei mir gegenteilige Gefühle auslöst, ich kann es nicht leiden wenn jemand mit Fremdwörtern und Satzkonstruktionen zu punkten versucht anstatt mit Inhalt.

Since (1) Germany is an economical superpower again, (2) everyone - not only on the Internet - appears to love us *and* our country unconditionally, and (3) our military is again allowed to bomb civilisations stuck in the Middle Ages back into the Stone Age, the German society has regained the necessary self-esteem to simply ignore all the evidence and insights of the past German century.

Our new working - or not-so-working - class don't earn enough money to sustain themselves through the wages and salaries paid in our labour market. But as so many people before have found out: Money is not the most important thing. It's more important to have pride; it's certainly easier to be proud to be German than advance socially in Germany these days.

The most comfortable form of pride for all participating parties is unconditional, uncritical pride. And Germans do like it comfy. That's also why there is this extravagant German word ""Gemütlichkeit"" summarising the diverse characteristics of comfortableness which isn't easily translated into English.

And it's utterly uncomfortable having to deal with responsibilities and self-inflicted shortcomings. It's easier to ignore reality or even rewrite and falsify history to make life more comfortable.

That's basically why some German kids with no say in our society think it appropriate to display neo-Nazi philosophy. 

&gt; ""They"" aren't humans. ""They"" have no feelings. ""They"" don't love or mourn. ""They"" **breed** - like animals. ""We"" watch ""them"". ""We"" control ""them"". ""We"" decide with whom ""they"" are allowed to procreate. 

&gt; I'd do a ""pure"" Icelandic chick anytime. I'd romance a Swedish lass whose family has never had contact to a non-Swedish intruder. I'd even marry a 100% Aryan German gal. But, please, Gypsies! They don't even breed with others! That's sub-human.

Of course, these aren't racist thoughts at all! It's just Asyx's opinion. And his opinion is subject to free-speech.

If you don't have citizenship, you have to apply for the permit and I believe you can only get one if you either bring in a significant amount of capital (~$1m+) or are not directly competing with EU citizens. I was able at first to teach english as a native ""American English"" speaker, so I didn't have any problems being accepted. Later on I married a German and so can legally live/work here due to that.

If you do this, make sure you get a good accountant. German accountants (who take you on officially as a client) are personally liable for errors in your reporting, so they generally do a good job and (supposedly) lower your chance of getting audited. German taxes are also considerably more complicated than US taxes (if you can believe that!). I know a couple of freelancers who do their own taxes, but if you have any sort of complex business at all, just do yourself a favor and hire an accountant.

Get ready for lots of paperwork for two different countries and lots of overhead for tax preparation.

Also be aware that the IRS is starting to get pretty hardcore about expats and people doing business in other countries.

""So they can't admit what they're doing is against the Constitution- they have to twist words to seem in line with the Constitution."" explains that though. :)

We have our share of unconstitutional legislation that later gets shot down by the constitutional court, too, but generally it was ambiguous and controversial beforehand whether those laws actually were in violation of the constitution or not. Actively negating a clear constitutional right through a new law is a whole different matter, and that was the impression I got from that post.

And yes, we do have checks and balances in Germany, too. It's pretty similar to the US, we just lack a strong, independent executive president and have a stronger focus on parliament instead. The chancellor, our equivalent to the US President, is elected by the Bundestag, our equivalent of the House of Representatives, not directly by the people. The rest is pretty much the same.

I feel like it's very safe to say that racially, the situation we Americans put the Blacks and the situation the gypsies have been put in are *very* comparable.

First of all, not all gypsies steal.  Second of all, why do you think that mother took the baby to beg?  Do you think it's because she likes the humiliation of it, or not being able to provide for her child?  Do you think those kids who *do not* get the same chances as there caucasian peers in education enjoy having to work two, three times as hard?  Or the fact that everyone judges them as poor degenerates, so they can't get a proper education, and then they can't get a proper job since the few okay jobs you could get without education go to non-gypsies because racism, then they're 20 something and their whole life the worlds shit on them, why would they want to unite with it?  So now they've been disillusioned about the world and the way it works and they're hunger or sick or homeless and need money bad, why should they not do whatever they can to help their families? There certainly are not other people helping them. So then they beg on the streets or pickpocket some dude with a full stomach and new coat and house to return to (and pickpocketing is not as big of an issue in regards to Romas as racists would have us believe) and *still* go to sleep hungry, or lacking some sort of basic human right they've had to chose between.

And you're going to bitch that you were annoyed by that woman begging? I don't know where you live from your flag, or I would have used explicit stats.  Feel free to tell me and I'll tell you. 

Oh, and *do* tell me the difference between the racial problems is.  Is it that there are people actually trying to help black people here?  And that at least *most* people aren't overtly bigoted towards them?  Or that for their educational chances are more fair when compared? Because yeah.  Those are true.  People admit the crimes committed against Black people happened and were wrong, too, so that's another difference.

**Long-time lobbying from agricultural companies**

For about 5 years the revision of the EU seed transfer law is active progress. Now it a proposal about strict laws and norms for seeds is in discussion in Brussels. According to the environment agencies Global 2000 and Arche Noah, rare breeds can't pass that strict laws and agricultural corporations will be the lucky winners of those laws.

In pure numbers that means: ""We have about 6500 different sorts in our genetic database, from which 5000 - 6000 wouldn't get a concession"", says Iga Niznik, responsible for seeds at Arche Noah, to ORF.at. The plant diversity is threatened due to this laws. Especially vegetable and  grain strains will disappear from gardens and fields.

According to the decision of the European Court from July 2013 it's forbidden for farmers to use non permitted seed strains. However, the direction didn't affect vintage and rare seeds, those could be legally exchanged between farmers and hobby gardeners. The discussed EU law will prohibit this exchange of seeds as well though.

*This contradicts bio diversity targets*

According to the main deciding committee (I'm sure there is a special English word for that ...), plants should be homogeneous and registered as official strain. The 12 active laws will all be replaced by that new law. After all that means the end of the national elbowroom (room to interpret the law, what would be a good idiom for that?), says the (Austrian) Green Party. Considering the defined laws for bio diversity, a law for uniform plant and vegetable strains seems ridiculous, says agricultural speaksmanfor the Green Party Wolfgang Pirklhuber.

The majority of the local rare and old strains of fruits, vegetables and grain can't ""tackle the bureaucratic and financial obstacles"" of the registration process due to biological reasons, says Arche Noah, this would means the strains can't we passed on anymore.

*Only reduced regulations for small businesses*

Austrian protest alone won't be enough the change the law in a more diverse direction. ""For that more EU countries would have to protest against it"", says Niznik to the ORF. With the joined petition with Global 2000 she wants to prevent the ""mandatory strain approval and certification for seed reliant (samenfest... I don't even know what that word means in German) seed and plant goods which are not protected by intellectual property"". 

The Monday introduced proposal for the Austrian parliament from the Green Party reads that the exchange of seeds between private individuals and farmers shouldn't be forbidden and small business should only have to fulfill reduced regulations in regards of labeling. The ÖVP farming and environment minister Nikolaus Berlakovich also speaks out against the endangerment of old strains and the over-bureaucratization  of producers. He demands ""strong improvements"" for the planned EU seed law.

*Pressure from the corporations can be felt*

Critics of the proposed law see a strong favouritism of large companies. The argument that with that law the consumer will get the highest, because strictly tested, quality possible only serves as a cover story according to Arche Noah. It's more the case that the pressure from the big seed producers can be felt.

Due to strict regulations the industrie can control what arrives at the costumer and with that destroy smaller competitors. Small companies would be threatened by costly law suits. Another critic point comes from the customers themselves, for a long time the complaints of less taste in tomatoes and cucumbers due to over cultivating and lack of diversity are standing.

*Official draft on 6th May*

It is still time to react, right now no official draft is ready in Brussels. By end of April the commission wants to voted about the current draft. According to Karin Kadenbach, SPÖ EU parliamentarian and member of the committee for farming and rural development, the negotiations take in general 4 to 6 months until they are voted on in the general plenum of the EU parliament. The results will decide about the date of discussion in the EU parliament. The 6th May is the planed release date for the publication of the draft, on the next day the EU parliament will be informed by  environmental MP Tonio Borg. It's unrealistic that this law will come to action before 2015.

*""No rescue action for little planties""*

Nizinik insists that it's not about ""rescuing a few, poor planties who will go extinct, but about the question what farmers are allowed to grow"". It's about key questions, for example what freedom of choice to the customers have in regards of their food? ""What seed will be available afterwards and what is landing on our plates""?

You know what, that sounds fucking awful.EDIT **I meant for them.**  I don't give racially based arguments much of my time, so here's what I told the other one:

&gt;I feel like it's very safe to say that racially, the situation we Americans put the Blacks and the situation the gypsies have been put in are very comparable.
First of all, not all gypsies steal. Second of all, why do you think that mother took the baby to beg? Do you think it's because she likes the humiliation of it, or not being able to provide for her child? Do you think those kids who do not get the same chances as there caucasian peers in education enjoy having to work two, three times as hard? Or the fact that everyone judges them as poor degenerates, so they can't get a proper education, and then they can't get a proper job since the few okay jobs you could get without education go to non-gypsies because racism, then they're 20 something and their whole life the worlds shit on them, why would they want to unite with it? So now they've been disillusioned about the world and the way it works and they're hunger or sick or homeless and need money bad, why should they not do whatever they can to help their families? There certainly are not other people helping them. So then they beg on the streets or pickpocket some dude with a full stomach and new coat and house to return to (and pickpocketing is not as big of an issue in regards to Romas as racists would have us believe) and still go to sleep hungry, or lacking some sort of basic human right they've had to chose between.
And you're going to bitch that you were annoyed by that woman begging? I don't know where you live from your flag, or I would have used explicit stats. Feel free to tell me and I'll tell you.
Oh, and do tell me the difference between the racial problems is. Is it that there are people actually trying to help black people here? And that at least most people aren't overtly bigoted towards them? Or that for their educational chances are more fair when compared? Because yeah. Those are true. People admit the crimes committed against Black people happened and were wrong, too, so that's another difference.
If you had said, well due to the rampant poverty many roma/gypsies are driven to lives as beggars or at the extreme end criminals I would at least respect your contributions in the conversations. But you use overt racism and admit it, and while that's ballsy (I hope, though I hear racism is a big issue in some countries) it's also stupid, irrational, superstitious and point blank wrong.

Bits at the end don't apply to you.

I mean, dude.  Dude.  Think about what you are saying.  Or are you really that heartless to have pity on those mainstream society, of which as you have internet access and can write I'm pretty sure you belong to, hurt.

Which book was that, if I may ask? ;)

&gt;Weird question, is your Constitution very set in stone, or is it frequently ratified?

Hmm. That's actually a pretty good question. You can't really say that it is set in stone, as there have been 52 changes to the constitution since 1949. [Here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany#Amendments) some background on that.

The basic essence hasn't really changed, though. Some parts of it are also completely excluded from ever being changed through the normal process, explained in detail [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_clause#Germany).",0,1366641350,null,0,false,0,c9k9efq,t3_1csjzi,t1_c9k9efq,t1_c9k8u0a,null,1431469905,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
true,HadoopThePeople,EURO,European Union,"First off, I'm not pissed that they beg, it's their choice (I'll get to that later). What I'm pissed about is educating children that doing anything useful to the society is stupid (went to school with gypsy children, so I know what I'm talking about here), that stealing from the ""suckers"" is best; I'm pissed with them stealing... that's a choice that's not ok with me. But there are so many ""trades"" that the gypsy have appropriated for themselves, like being the intermediary between farmers and the consumer... in Bucharest you have producer markets, with very few producers... There are also, the NGO gypsies, using EU funds to ""fight discrimination"", while all they do is accuse people of being racist and not helping the community in any why (it's cheaper and you get to keep the rest of the money). Drowned in all this, there's the working gypsy raising a family, living in a decent apartment among decent folk... but still living in the culture that all outside rule shouldn't apply: if they have a party, they won't keep the music down; if a neighbor will complain, they'll spit on you and insult you at the least... I'm sure there's decent gypsy some place, I'm sad to say I didn't see them. Maybe I was born to late, because people assure me it was a bit better during the communist period.

Now, back to the oppressed... nobody oppresses them (quite the other way around) and whoever tell you otherwise is either talking from their ass or lying. Ok, I'll admit, maybe they have a very narrow view and lots of luck and they only met the good cases around.

What you'll hear from smart and decent people that tried to do something to integrate this population in the last 20 years is that: they're usually not interested. And I assure you, there's no teacher openly discriminating against the gypsy children (as they might do against the gay or other minorities... and you don't see them quitting school at 10). There's no separate toilets for the gypsy, voting laws preventing them to do it. Most of them had jobs back in 1990 when the communist regime fell and they quit them as soon as they could to start who knows what (like stealing irrigation pipes or selling goods). So an honest job is not the solution because they refused it and will do so as long as they can make easy money without work. What everybody that ever proposed a job to a gypsy will tell you is that they'll refuse 9 times out of 10 the same work conditions a Romanian will accept.

As for admitting to being racist... then why mention it? I won't debate it... I have seen and heard enough to say it. But don't mistake me to some violent moron burning crosses or some skinhead beating up children in the street. And I'm saying that I'm a racist especially to not be confused with the GOP or some other hidden racists.

Une des critiques que je pourrais faire est que justement la communauté Asiatique dérange moins parce que précisément ils ne revendiquent pas de s'intégrer au reste de la société. Donc on dit aux étrangers qu'ils ne s'intègrent pas et que c'est mal mais en même temps on prend en exemple ceux qui demandent le moins à le faire.

Et du trafic il y en a dans les milieux asiatiques, il est juste beaucoup moins visible et peut-être attendent-ils moins des pouvoirs publics?

La région est d'ailleurs surnommée l'Ovalie, parce que le ballon de rugby est ovale. Ça se voit au niveau des clubs : à part les 2 clubs parisiens, les équipes du championnat de rugby (le top 14) sont toutes situées dans le sud, et au niveau des licenciés : http://i.imgur.com/pDpPFy4.jpg.


Mais même dans le sud-ouest, le sport le plus populaire reste le football, notamment parce que les règles sont plus faciles à comprendre au premier abord. Au niveau de la pratique le football est plus populaire parce qu'on peut y jouer n'importe où : il suffit d'un ballon et d'une personne qui t'accompagne, et tu peux jouer dans la rue, dans la cour de l'école... Alors qu'à 2 au rugby on s'emmerde vite, et qu'il faut jouer sur de l'herbe (dans un stade ou dans un pré) car c'est un sport de contact.

Comme le rugby est un sport plus confidentiel que le football, il aime se distinguer en mettant en avant ses ""valeurs"". On parle de ""la grande famille du rugby"", du collectif (c'est vrai que le rugby est un sport où l'exploit individuel est moins valorisé qu'au football, les plus beaux essais pour les puristes sont ceux où toute l'équipe touche le ballon), de la convivialité, de la 3ème mi-temps où les 2 équipes qui se sont tapées dessus pendant 80 minutes vont faire la fête ensemble... C'est un peu vrai, ça l'a sans douté beaucoup été dans le passé, mais aujourd'hui c'est surtout du storytelling commercial.

Very true, thank god for that! And a good example in the region, towards those other enlightened nations of Eastern Europe (Hungary and Bulgaria ,i'm looking at you). 

&gt;even though they have access to free education and positive discrimination access to those universities

This is congruous to your general way of thinking, so my argument will be more general: Do you expect that in those 5 years (I'm not sure for how long the affirmative action program for gypsies has been in place) we'd suddenly start seeing all the gypsies flocking to universities? After they've been living in horrible conditions for centuries? Do you think that giving them apartments to rent (as famously done several years back in Braila I think) will suddenly turn them into model citizens overnight? This isn't even racism, it's pure ignorance of simple psychology on your part. 

&gt; they don't have a dr. King and not because the Romanians killed him... they have a king, a prince, an emperor and tribal chiefs

Before criticizing 'their' social cohesion look at social cohesion in Romania in general: it's terrible. Compare it to the west (where you seem to be living now). So, for an analogy: social cohesion between gypsies compared to social cohesion between Romanians is the same as between Romanians and Western Europeans (I've lived in several WE countries so I have a general picture). I put 'their' in quotes since I'm basing this on the assumption of 'to each his own' when instead I think cohesion should be based at least on nationality (romanians between themselves - gypsy or not) or ideally. .well being fellow human beings.

Between 2000 and 2010 Norway's oil production declined by 40%. Denmark's production is barely more than its consumption. Inevitably even they are going to require Russian hydrocarbons.

&gt;Finland needs Russian hydrocarbon the most, but we do have LNG terminals so we can also buy it elsewhere if we are completely cut off. 

Finland would be screwed without Russian hydrocarbons, especially oil as there is no replacement for that. Finland imports 80% of it from Russia and LNG is expensive compared to the gas you get from pipelines directly from Russia.

&gt;Nordic countries also have lots of renewables nuclear power.

Yes and that's what we should focus on more than building our armed forces.

&gt;And Russia is as dependant on Europe's gas market for income as we are for it's supply.

For now, but they are building pipelines to Asia, most notably China, who will gladly buy Russian oil and gas. And obviously its a mutually beneficial deal, but if Russia were to cut off their supply to Europe for whatever reason, that would have devastating effects on the European economy, and the global economy, there's no denying that.

If everyone around the child acts as if he won't do anything with his life he won't, basic child psychology. His parents aren't going to be able to help- they were that child because *their* parents were that child etc etc. At this point in being dismissed and in some areas actively acted against, I would not be surprised if their cultural identity is just as dismissive of the mainstream society's- it happens and has a name I can't remember.  (This whole conversation would have so much better a week ago or a week from now btw, everything I own is packed away right now but I'll try to find the term on the internet.)

You're on the right path mentally- you see that they need to be helped at least and I'd go as far as to say you shouldn't call yourself racists; seeing a problem with a community isn't as I said- blaming it on them is.  Which You do do, but not as much as most people I've talked to (which is why I'm even replying). You have to understand that lots of things you take advantage of they can't- you might not see it, but then you're not roma. I don't get called the n word or get turned down from too many jobs as soon as they see my skin tone to be a coincidence, or have teachers say I ""just shouldn't waste the money on college admissions""; that doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  I'm lucky enough to not have to deal with it (well, for my skin at least, but that's a whole another ball game.) I have an advantage over Black people because of that- when they're having to put effort in getting around that I can be doing whatever it is I really need to do. Now replace black with gypsies and I with you.

**http://wws.princeton.edu/research/cases/italy.pdf**

&gt;For the Chancellor, keeping Italy out of the EMU was essential to ensure that it
would not gain a place in the hard core of political union – not until it had successfully
completed its political and economic transformation. Prodi and Ciampi, however,
believed that Italy’s transformation would not be complete until Italy joined the hard
core.

The German plan was to keep Italy out until later.

&gt;Renewed diplomatic
efforts were directed at the German government; a communication campaign was
launched with the target of showing the German public Italy’s reliability as a key partner.
Prodi made more and more references to the geopolitical implications of the EMU,
emphasizing that Europe without a Mediterranean dimension went against history and
against logic.

Prodi fought for the exact opposite, argued for the ""Mediterranean dimension"".

&gt;That the Maastricht Treaty contained both convergence criteria and a fixed start
date was the result of a compromise (
4
). The criteria had been inserted under pressure
from the German government, reflecting the views of the Bundesbank

German pressure forced Maastricht Critiera, was compromise between France and Germany.

&gt;But surprises were not over yet – political events in France took an unexpected
turn. Chirac had anticipated legislative elections at the end of May. As the 3 percent
hurdle was also becoming difficult for France to achieve, he reckoned that budget cuts
would be more easily approved by a new Parliament. But the French electorate did not
like the prospect. They delivered a solid majority to the Socialist Party led by Lionel
Jospin, ushering in a period of cohabitation (
13
).
Jospin’s views on the EMU were rather different from Chirac’s; **he feared German
hegemony over a monetary area with few members**; he believed that the EMU had to
pursue policies aimed at economic growth; and **he believed that the presence of Italy and
Spain was necessary to balance Germany’s preference for price stability**.

This is especially relevant. Chirac's (conservative) loss to Jospin (social democrat) created the French political phenomenon where the French executive government is split because the Prime Minister is not directly elected with the President or appointed by him.

The French Socialist position on the EMU was always that the EMU needed more members to counteract German influence, especially Italy and Spain. Mitterrand was in power until 1995. The French Conservative position (Chirac) was different, but he changed his course after that loss to Jospin.

&gt;Germany had lost much of its credibility in asking for a strict interpretation of the criteria.
France came to support Italy’s bid. The Konzept of a hard-core EMU was in tatters

And now southern Europe won its entry into the Euro zone.

Here is the paper's résumé:

&gt;France modified its national strategy because of Jospin’s victory

&gt;The criteria had been previously employed by Germany as instruments to build a
hard core of European nations

&gt;If Germany had kept control over the convergence criteria and France had
elected a right-wing government, it is questionable whether Italy’s convergence
might have sufficed to win admission to the EMU

Ultimately France's change of course and Germany's political miscalculation is why Italy was successful in entering. Italy being representative of the ""Mediterranean countries"".

**http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/02/news/02iht-emu.t.html**

&gt;France is keen to have southern EU states join the single currency, both to prevent any future devaluations and to offset the preponderant influence of Germany on European economic and monetary policy.

The NY Times claims that Chirac had the same basic fear, but approached it differently:

&gt;Christopher Potts, economist at the brokerage Chevreux de Virieu in Paris, said Mr. Chirac's real aim is to ensure that southern Europe isn't shut out even if Italy is excluded from monetary union initially.

So Chirac is supposedly playing strategically because he accepted that Italy wouldn't be ready initially:

&gt;Unfortunately for Paris, Italian participation in the Euro appears unlikely in 1999. Many analysts doubt whether it can achieve its deficit target given the stagnation of Italy's economy. Italy's outstanding debt stands at more than 120 percent of gross domestic product, double the single-currency requirement. And perhaps most important, the prospect of Italian membership frightens Germans, given the lira's record of weakness.

The New York Times thus claims Chirac was playing it strategically by supporting Germany against Italy but using that position to make sure southern Europe wouldn't be completely left out.

&gt;What's more, the incident masked the fact that both France and Italy share a common underlying desire that Europe's single currency be adopted by as many countries as possible, especially southern members of the European Union, officials and analysts said.

Once more highlighting the common interest of a counterweight to Northern Europe.

&gt;Although a 
number of politicians in Germany and Holland, well-known US economists and the 
international press were not entirely convinced [that Italy would be ready to join the Euro zone initially], the financial markets trusted Prodi. Italy 
also benefited from tactical support from France, whose aim was to decrease the rate of 
Germanization of the Euro-zone

One more source showing the general French opposition to German hegemony (=strict fiscal rules) in the EMU.

**MAASTRICHT COMPROMISE**

**http://aei.pitt.edu/7014/1/sevilla_christina.pdf**

&gt;The compromise plan for EMU hammered out between the Delors Report 
and the Intergovernmental Conference concluding at Maastricht in December 1991 was essentially a 
struggle between two fundamentally different economic philosophies: the ""monetarist"" position, championed primarily by France and Italy, and the ""economist"" position, defended by the Germans and 
the Dutch, and which was the view essentially expressed in the report unanimously submitted by the 
central bankers, Commissioners, and independent experts on the Delors Committee.

That's the basic conflict. France and the Mediterranean countries on one side versus the fiscally strict view of Germany, Netherlands and the Northern countries.

&gt;The 
French president wanted an immediate transition to irrevocably fixed exchange rates, without much 
emphasis on coordinating economic policies beforehand. Once exchange rates were locked in this way, 
he argued, economic policies of member states would be forced into convergence. The German 
Chancellor, on the contrary, insisted on policy convergence as a prerequisite for EMU, arguing that 
monetary union would have to be the crowning act of a process of harmonization and then unification 
of economic policies

Very clear. The French vision of the Euro zone is the current version. Binding together monetarily forces convergence. That is exactly what HASN'T worked. The German vision is that of political union and harmonisation and THEN monetary union. This is why Germany and the Netherlands wanted a ""hard core Euro zone"" because political union was possible that way.

&gt;Pohl took the initiative to argue strongly for binding 
budgetary rules

Pohl was the Bundesbank president present at Maastricht in 1992.

&gt;France 
and Italy emphasized the catalytic effect of firm timetables upon convergence. They wanted to move 
quickly to EMU, and believed that rapid institutional change would harness market forces to accelerate 
nominal convergence in goods markets and financial markets, as well as increase political readiness to 
take tough measures as deadlines approached

France and Italy want to go ahead quickly. Note: Mitterrand is in power, not Chirac. Italy and France still on one side.

&gt;Predictably, Germany and the Netherlands feared that institutional innovation would get ahead of 
true economic convergence, and resisted any transfer of monetary authority during the second stage.47 
They preferred to emphasize the conditions for entering a full monetary union, believing that tough 
criteria for nominal and real convergence must be met before movement to irrevocably fixed rates and 
a single currency

Germany and Netherlands voicing concerns of lacking real convergence. Against France and Italy.

**EURO FRENCH PRECONDITION FOR GERMAN REUNIFICATION**

**http://aei.pitt.edu/7014/1/sevilla_christina.pdf**

&gt;France, for its part, conditioned its support for German unification on progress in Europe in 
general and on EMU in particular. On the eve of the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, President 
Mitterand announced that the fall of Soviet communism required an acceleration of the ""construction"" 
of Europe, and in November 1989 he visited the other 11 EC capitals to press the issue of monetary 
union.

Says it clearly. The whole paragraph after that goes into more detail.

If living next door to me (and most people in Bucharest, because I'm not the only one who had gypsies for neighbors) in a similar apartments is horrible conditions... then fuck, I should talk more about my awful childhood.

&gt;I'm not sure for how long the affirmative action program for gypsies has been in place

At least 13 years, plenty of time to have some of them graduating. And before that there was the whole communism thing going on, with real equal opportunities. Most gypsies that graduated from an University, graduated before '89 and awfully few since.

&gt;Before criticizing 'their' social cohesion look at social cohesion in Romania in general: it's terrible.

Last time I checked we had a civilization... roofs, canalization, laws...

&gt;social cohesion between gypsies compared to social cohesion between Romanians is the same as between Romanians and Western Europeans

You're a moron. How's that for analogies, cohesion between Romanians and western know-it-all-itude.

&gt;Generalizing based on the bad apples will only make us ignore those that are in real need.

I'm starting to think you're in need... Get out more, smoke less, read some Marx, go meet some gypsies in a camp nearby. Don't preach what you don't know, sonny. ",0,1366644512,null,0,false,0,c9kaey6,t3_1cthxi,t1_c9kaey6,t1_c9ka1w5,null,1431469427,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
true,rabbitlion,SWED,Sweden,"NATO has several functions and NORDEFCO can replace some but not all of them. The original point of being a member of NATO is that the United States promise to use their 732 billion dollar defense budget to defend your country against a Russian invasion. NORDEFCO can't provide that at all, so it can't really replace NATO.

In peace-time areas like training, equipment and strategic development NORDEFCO could replace a lot of what NATO does, but the US still contributes with a lot of really useful stuff. The Nordic countries don't have anywhere near the field experience that the US does, so discarding their input seems like it would hurt.

The third area, which I guess is your major reason for not wanting to be in NATO, is the international policing stuff. NORDEFCO has no ambition to take part in that kind of stuff (and we don't have nearly enough resources to do so anyway). To some extent, you could say that NATO's role here is just to increase the US military budget by 30%. I suppose that's the price you pay for having their guaranteed backing if attacked.

My personal opinion regarding the last point is that some kind of world police is needed. The UN cannot really fill this role because of its control structure. No one will freely hand over the military forces they pay for to an organization they don't control without some kind of reward. Optimally this organization should be controlled by a council of various countries where they get power in relation to their forces, with none of them contributing more than 10% (or even 5%) of the total. It should be powerful enough to easily overpower any rogue countries or rebellions, in all areas of the world at the same time. This would hopefully lead to a situation where starting wars is pointless in the first place because the world police would just come in and bust you. 

It goes without saying that such a police force would currently be prohibitively expensive. The only country really willing to pay for it seems to be the US, and that is why they're currently running the only world police. I would like to say that Sweden should be willing too, but honestly I'm not so sure that it's worth it. Is it really worth trashing the welfare, education, health care and so on just to help other countries with the problems they caused themselves?

**Food wise:**

Find a good local bakery by your apt that wil be open. Go there. 

Local cheese places have assorted plates of cheese for cheap. 

Get some decent wine from a grocery store. Combine these three for picnics. There are only a few places you can't drink in public such as the Tuileries. Your local bakery should also have some decent sandwiches at a good price. They're worth it in the sense that the bread is amazing. 

If you go near the Eiffel Tower/L'Arc on Saturday morning, make sure to stop at the ""Marché de l'Alma"" farmer's market that starts at the Iéna metro stop. It's basically in between the Eiffel Tower and L'arc. 


**Money wise:** 

It all depends on what you want to do. Every museum is more expensive than any museum in the states. I would personally skip going up the Eiffel Tower if time/money is an issue. There are great free views from Printemps and Sacre Coeur. The Musée Carnavalet is free and goes over the history of Paris. 

There's going to be a HUGE line outside the big pyramid at the Louvre. This is for people that don't have tickets. You can get one in advance without waiting by going underground to a tabac stand in the Carrousel du Louvre. You can enter down there or come back up and literally walk past the entire line outside the Pyramid. 

Some ATMs close on Sundays. I can't even. 

Use your change, give exact change.

&gt; Critics say Nalco, which formed a joint venture company with Exxon Chemical in 1994, boasts oil-industry insiders on its board of directors and among its executives, including an 11-year board member at BP and a top Exxon executive who spent 43 years with the oil giant.

genauer:

&gt; Of 18 dispersants whose use EPA has approved, 12 were found to be more effective on southern Louisiana crude than Corexit, EPA data show. Two of the 12 were found to be 100 percent effective on Gulf of Mexico crude, while the two Corexit products rated 56 percent and 63 percent effective, respectively. The toxicity of the 12 was shown to be either comparable to the Corexit line or, in some cases, 10 or 20 times less, according to EPA.

Yes I definitely see what you mean: ""Russia uses military exercises not only too keep it's units ready but also to send a political message."" And this is true.

I'm inclined to disagree wholeheartedly with that statement, especially after seeing the radical right wing rising to power in Greece, and Eastern Europe's (Romania) recent legislation banning gays. That statement might hold more validity if you are comparing the U.S. to Nordic countries, but the comparison becomes much more sweeping at that level. 

&gt;The rights to guns might be guaranteed by your constitution, but take for example the latest debate about background checks for gun ownership. I mean to bar people who are nuts from having guns is rational, regardless to what your constiution says. To say otherwise and simply refer to a several hundreds y/o document is preposterous.

Every state where mass shootings have taken place had the strictest gun laws in the country. Connecticut trails behind only California and New York on tough gun laws. The argument here is why potentially violate people's 4th amendment rights (illegal search &amp; seizure) when the methods proposed clearly don't work? Other alternatives such as better mental healthcare and free access for all children to mental healthcare are viewed as much more rational, seeing as every single mass murderer that used a gun was already diagnosed with some sort of mental condition and was receiving some form of treatment. Even the NRA says selling guns to people with mental health problems is a horrible idea. Americans are fine with the mental health approach, the unnecessary violation of 4th amendment rights proposed by Obama is what sets off the reactions you see. 

&gt;This being said though the US has more deaths related to gun than the whole of the western world combined. This is in part due to your gun policy.

Yes, this is true. However, what is never reported on or listed are the crimes gun ownership deters. It is estimated guns stop over 2.5 million crimes a year from happening in the United States. Gun free areas such as inner cities have far more crime than those that are not gun free. I'm not willing to give up my gun in the hopes the United States emulates a homogeneous Nordic country with a population of 5 million people. Here's a Duke University article that explains my position: http://people.duke.edu/~gnsmith/articles/myths.htm

This project is about using ~~foreign languages~~ English in national institutions, allegedly because this will attract more students.

What the French Minister of higher eduction doesn't understand or purposefully ignores, is that if we have so many students currently, it's precisely because they want to study in French; if they wanted to study in English, they would've chosen one of the many, many options in the Anglo-Saxon world.

One also shouldn't undermine the message that this project, if adopted, would send out to the rest of the French-speaking world; how can France, the seat of the *Francophonie*, act against herself ? Ignoring her history, and following the flavor of the month ?

Such self-bashing from French officials and the fact that it is hip to do so is disturbing indeed. Did you know Christine Lagarde, when she was the Minister of Economy of France, would send out internal notes in English ? For shame...

Another good example good be Fiat that is in deep troubles, largely thanks to its Italian factories having too high wages. Not to mention Greek shipbuilding industries, deep trouble too.

^This is the database! First look for Type of accreditation ""Sending Org"" in your nation/area, then browse for hosting orgs in your field of interest.  

Location is not that important, just note the difference between being in a city or being in the countryside. I come from the countryside, so I wanted to live in a city. I went to a city I never heard of before because I loved the project and I had the best experience ever (PM me for more detailed infos!).  
Don't focus on big cities where everybody and their mother want to go, it's way less easy to find a place and you may be missing out great places and projects that would be more suited for you.  

You can start looking for projects and proposing yourself even now, but most will be taking a decision for autumn 2014 in spring 2014.

Yeah, keep on keeping those rents down! (Honestly, I probably wouldn’t want to live in Wilhelmsburg longer than the four months I’m here for my internship and I wouldn’t necessarily want to be a student, writing my thesis. Currently I spend half of my time – besides sleeping – in the office, so Wilhelmsburg is perfectly ok. Also, I pay less than 300€ per month and am stupidly close to my workplace – only one S-Bahn station to Hammerbrook – and consequently also stupidly close to the center of city.)

But OP, I can tell you that finding an apartment will be extremely difficult. How much money can you spend? You should plan to spend between 400€ and 600€ (warm, i.e. including heat and utilities) for an apartment with roommates in an area of town you desire, probably on the upper end of that if you want an apartment for yourself.

Also expect to not be able to rent something (easily) over the phone. Demand is through the roof, so landlords don’t have to give their apartment to someone they have never met in person. A colleague of mine from work has now been searching for an apartment for months, without success and he is actually here and can met landlords and look at apartments in person.

You should probably best travel here, stay in the Youth Hostel for a few nights and look at as many apartments as you possibly can and hope you get lucky. It’s insane. (Though the situation in Harburg may be a bit more relaxed. I can only recommend you to live close to a place where you have to only travel short distances to your regular workplace. That’s worth a lot. Public transit is good enough in Hamburg that pretty much no matter where you live, you will always be able to get to all the cool places.)

From Wikipedia:

In 1948 the first solid plans on how to create an atomic weapon was presented to the FOA (""Försvarets forskningsanstalt"", Swedish Defence Research Agency). Plans were established to run a civilian nuclear power programme in parallel, using domestic uranium resources as nuclear fuel. The Ågesta and Marviken reactors were supposed to produce plutonium for the weapons, while also producing energy. The Saab 36 was a planned attack aircraft that would be able to deliver nuclear weapons, and later on, submarines and aircraft like the Lansen and ultimately Viggen were considered as means of delivery as well.

All of the nuclear development activities took place at the FOA. The plan was to produce 100 warheads in a timespan of ten years. [1]

During the 1960s it was still not clear if Sweden should develop a nuclear weapon capacity. By the end of the 1960s the Swedish government, because of military budget constraints, had to choose between a nuclear weapon or a new fighter aircraft (the Saab 37 Viggen).[citation needed] The choice fell with the new fighter. All the plans for a Swedish nuclear weapon were scrapped by 1968, when Sweden signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In 1972 the last remnants of a plan for nuclear weapons was discontinued when the FoA stopped their experiments with plutonium.

Now your questions.

Breakfast: During the week I eat fruits with yoghurt and nuts. At the weekend I eat german buns (Brötchen) with marmalade, nutella, or cheese. As far as I know there are no equivalent things like our Brötchen in America.

Lunch: During the week I often just eat a little snack (bread or some vegetables or sometimes a cupcake or cake).

Dinner: I love to cook, so I cook fresh everyday. I love pasta and fish. And any kind of vegetables.

I never really understood the school system in America, but I never really looked into the subject. Here in Germany you have 4 years Grundschule (like primary school I guess). You start school with 6. When you are about 9 or 10 years old there are 4 possibilities for the next school. If you sucked in Grundschule you often go to Hauptschule. If you were okay you go to Realschule and if you were good/brilliant you go to Gymnasium. And then there is the Gesamtschule where you can go for all three forms - so you can change easy, if you get better. Realschule and Hauptschule end when you are about 17/18 and you mostly try to get a place for an apprenticeship. Gymnasium will end when you are 19/20 and you can go studying afterwards.
So I guess the school system is kind of different.

The drinking age is lower here - you can buy beer and wine when you are 16, and hard alcohol when you are 18. I guess that is one thing Americans won't understand and maybe can't imagine. The other way around: You are allowed to drive with 18 and not everybody does.

And there is another thing: We don't have roomates, we mostly have flatmates. I could not imagine to live with someone in one room without any privacy.

Hope that helps.

That is not a crazy world domination scheme, it's just national self-interest. You can't take for granted that Germany refrains from doing that. 

Second, the evidence: Germany allowed Italy in the eurozone even though they could have refused. Germany had an incentive to allow this because it stood to gain from peripheral countries not being able to use competitive currency devaluation.

*Singing*  
There you are  
You have seen this moment in your dreams so often  
There it is  
That day that you knew which would come is finally here  
Are you ready?  
Can you ever really be?  
There you are  
Everyone has a task in this life  
Done everything to prepare  
And there it is  
You promise you will give it your all  
Every step you took led to this point  
And look around you  
We're walking along  

*CHORUS 1:*  
Through the rain and the wind  
I will keep standing next to you  
I will protect you against everything that comes  
I shall stay awake when you're asleep  
I will keep you from the storm  
I will keep you safe as long as I'm alive  

*Rap:*  
One battle, two lives  
We stand for one another, unbreakable  
One flag, two lions  
Together in the sun and the rain  
Side by side, chest out  
Proud as a peacock, this is our sound  
And however small we may be  
Our acts are great  
Are not going to fail  
For you, my child  
For my dad  
For my mom  
Walk for you through the wind and rain  
And will stand behind you  
I carry a banner with your name  
Believe in you as long as we exist  
I build a dyke with my bare hands  
And keep the water away from you  

*CHORUS 2:*  
Let me know what you dream  
What your heart so yearns for  
I shall not rest until it has become truth  
And if you ever lose your way  
I'll be your beacon in the night  
I'm pointing you to the harbour in the darkness  
I will fight like a lion  
Until you have nothing more to want  
I'm keeping you safe  
As long as I'm alive

All of Orange stands side by side  
The W of water which we do not avoid  
We drain [lit. make it dry] it and we build dykes  
The W of welcome in our midst  
Whichever God you pray to  
The W of William  
The W of William  
The W of waking, eating [stamppot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamppot)  
Millions of coaches who know better  
The W of always wanting to win  
Whatever it is we start

It makes no difference the theme for the sending org, it could be that they know of more organizations in their field but that's it.  

Istambul is definitely a popular destination, but you should try anyway of course!! Just don't put all your hopes there! You should send at least 20 requests, then it depends on which deadline you want to apply (i think there are 3 in a yeas, btw the sending org should know them).  
  
I'm confused by your question about the Baltics. Do you mean the Baltic states as in Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia?   

I'd rather not be much specific, but I did one year of EVS in a Central European state. Best experience ever!! I made a lot of friends and it has been an amazing year. I think it's really important to choose a project that you're interested in and to check what the organization does in the every day activities.  
I'll give you also some warnings, there are some people who had a hard time adjusting to their volunteering experience. Some thought they were going to do something else, some found it boring, some found that they were nothing more than a badly paid help. Because of this it's important that you find an org and a theme that interests you and you need to be proactive making the best of your experience.  

But you should also have a pre-departure training to prepare yourself for the experience! I didn't have it because my national agency isn't the most active ever.

* Border shop: Reduction in soda tax won't have an effect
* End of the soda tax: Historic that a tax is completely ended
* Health researcher criticizes tax-free soda plan
* So, beer and soft drinks will be cheaper
* Diabetes Association: Cheaper soda will have serious consequences
* Associate Professor: Lower soda tax won't make much difference in cross-border trade

Une chose dont les médias parlent peu en ce moment c'est la majorité silencieuse. C'est cette majorité qui fait toute la différence lors d'élections. 
Les sondages englobe des gens de tout bords, mais ce qui compte réellement c'est les opinions personnels des citoyens.
En ce moment il y a un Hollande-bashing, entre des pseudo rasta adepte de la menthe hollandaise et du chocolat marocain qui vivaient dans l'utopie de voir du changement avec la gauche au pouvoir, une droite qui à les nerfs d'avoir perdu la place du capitaine sur le navire qui critiquent tout, des râleurs qui sont jamais content...

On peut prendre d'autre exemple où la France fait preuve du mauvaise élève en Europe.

Depuis le jour qu'il a été élu, il a vraiment la puasse:

true,i_love_pasta,ITAL,Italy,"I'd say that the President of the Republic (not just Napolitano) is the most popular politician in Italy. He is the symbol of the Republic, a sort of noble father (or grandfather) to everyone. He is required to be neutral and to safeguard out constitution. He has some power but he doesn't make laws so he is not the one screwing people. So, our President is usually well liked, especially in a time like this in which parties aren't trusted at all.

Napolitano was liked for most of his time as the President for these reasons. He had a couple of problems though:

1.  he signed some shameful laws on the first time that were then deemed uncostitutional by the Constitutional Court  (every law has to be signed by the President, but he can refuse to sign them once if those go against the constitution. That is a strong signal. Anyway, the parliament could still bring them back to him without a change and he has to sign them on the second time).
2. there were some phone interception between him and a former minister that could have been relevant in a trial about some deals between the state and the mafia in the early '90s. Those has been destroyed without listening to them. It looks like he has something to hide or someone to protect.

Napolitano is still well liked (I like him too). But he has been made President again and that is the first time it has happened. Fourteen years in charge of a country are too many. Also, he has been chosen because the parties couldn't choose (well, the Partito Democratico couldn't choose, the others had a clear idea). Finally, the voters of the PD were asking for another guy, Rodotà. The guy that was supported by the small ally of the PD, SEL. And, also, the guy who was supported by the new party in the parliament, the Movimento 5 Stelle of the ex-comedian Grillo. There is no love lost between Grillo and half of the old leaders of the PD, so the PD didn't want to support Rodotà. This has created an internal feud among the leaders of the PD that led to an epic failure during the vote and the resignation of them all. In this time of desperation, they asked the only one they all trusted to be President again. So he is now a President that reminds people of how things has gone wrong.

So, most people (or the most vocal) would have liked Rodotà as the President. As far as real politician (the ones we love to hate) the most popular are Renzi (the most right wing of the centre-left), Grillo and (still) Berlusconi (not in order of popularity here). Probably the PD will split in two with its left wing merging with SEL.

It may be interesting to notice that after the whole suicide of the PD, today we had a regional election in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (a small region on the border with Slovenia). Many where wondering if the M5S would have won its first region. Instead, the PD won. Their candidate was anyway a young woman who has been opposing the old PD leaders for a long time.

Which interestingly, coincides with the raise and fall of Krupp dynasty. 

Krupp perfected the steel guns with a screw breech-loader at a time when the French army were still using muzzle-loading bronze guns. 

In the war of 1871, for the first time in history, the French were no match for the Prussian artillery. The Prussians loaded and fired their cannons about 6 times faster than the French.

&gt;Indeed, unable to sell his steel cannon, Krupp gave it to the King of Prussia, who used it as a decorative piece. The king's brother Wilhelm, however, realized the significance of the innovation. After he became regent in 1859, Prussia bought its first 312 steel cannon from Krupp, which became the main arms manufacturer for the Prussian military.

&gt;The French high command refused to purchase Krupp guns despite Napoleon III's support. The Franco-Prussian war was in part a contest of ""Kruppstahl"" versus bronze cannon. The success of German artillery spurred the first international arms race, against Schneider in France and Armstrong in England. Krupp was able to sell, alternately, improved artillery and improved steel shielding to countries from Russia to Chile to Siam.

1. Salou? How did you wind up picking that as a destination? To be honest, it's...probably the least-nice place in the entire country. Dumpy hotels, trashy package tourists on week-long cheap-booze benders, nearly every restaurant a ""fulll English breakfast"" place. If it's an option I'd suggest looking at a different destination: Cadaques, Figueres, and most of the towns up and down the coast are vastly more pleasant places to spend time, many with beautiful unspoiled beaches. Or stay in Tarragona and visit beaches from there. That said if you're committed to it, you can take a train from Sants and bringing your luggage will be no problem. Trains run every hour or two and cost around 10€ each way. http://renfe.es 

2. As a tourist you don't need Catalan at all. In Salou you'll probably find everyone speaks English (plenty won't speak Spanish). 

3. Tipping isn't necessary, though it's customary to round up a bit --&gt; if your bill comes to 23,75€ you might leave 1,25€ at most. This applies to taxis, bars, restaurants, pretty much any situation. 

4. You can buy Barça tickets online; they can be hard to come by for popular matches. Prices usually range from 75-100€. Do not buy from scalpers; the risk is very high that your ticket won't be honored. 

5. There's an old book shop called Balagué in the Eixample that may be what you're looking for. You'll also find hundreds of interesting old shops and bars in the Gothic Quarter and the Raval.

You can expect warm (not hot) days; look [here](http://www.accuweather.com/en/it/rome/213490/may-weather/213490?monyr=5/1/2013) for historical min/max temperature.

About what to wear: avoid shorts at all costs, t-shirts are ok if cool enough - look at fellow Romans for guidance.

Food is excellent in Rome, if heavy; ""pizza al taglio"" is ubiquitous and usually good: try the one with 'alici e fiori di zucca' (anchovies and cougette flowers), or 'broccoli e salsiccia' (sausage and broccoli).

Other typical 'not so healthy but good' treats are fried 'arancini' and 'suppli' (fried rice balls). Don't overdo it if you care about your liver! 
Many excellent ice cream shops, and if the weather is hot, go for a 'granita con panna' (iced coffee with whipped cream). 

About restaurants: Rome is huge, and there are many excellent places - just avoid tourist traps especially next to the Vatican, etc.. It depends really on where you are staying. 

Trastevere is great for a relaxed night out. San Lorenzo is somewhat more on the 'alternative' side, but I personally had lots of fun there.. if you are on a study trip, ask your fellow students for the 'hottest' places, but - if you can - avoid expats-only hangouts (just my 0.02)..

What to avoid: pickpockets run rampant, be careful when buying tickets from machines - chances are if you are not alert enough, somebody is going to snatch your wallet and run. Best defense is to carry little money!
 
Taxi drivers have a bad reputation of overcharging - and are expensive compared to other European cities, but I personally never had any problem (just, do not take a taxi from the airport - it's horribly expensive; go with the train).

Avoid groups of gypsies - racist as it may sound,  keep distance; don't accept any offer to gamble on anything (pool included)!

The Texas issue is a toss up between the Christian fundamentalist electorate and conservative values. On one hand, you have conservatives who are mad that the state allocates tax dollars to giving free abortions. In the other group that opposes it, you have the nutjob Christians and their whole issue with it. 

The conservative issue with planned parenthood can be argued successfully in certain cases. It should not be the job of taxpayers to subsidize poor decision making on the part of impoverished women. Better sex-ed in public school should tackle the problem instead of forcing wealthier brackets to pick up the slack.

&gt;Even though you have strict gun laws in some states you can hardly claim that transportation of guns through states is difficult.

It's harder now than it ever has been historically. Gun shows no longer allow out of state residents to purchase weapons banned in their home state. It still remains easy to access a gun illegally via the system however. The ATF site can clarify this for you better than I can: http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/unlicensed-persons.html

&gt;This is neither a factual or reliable source. This goes for the Cato insitutute cited in the Forbes article as well.

Both are based in factual numbers and have yet to be discredited by any pro gun control source. I would be interested to see gun control groups showing hard numbers to support their claims, but no such figures exist for America. The closest thing we had was the Brady legislation pushed by Clinton which effectively did nothing to stop gun crime, despite making it very hard to get ""assault style weapons."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban#Expiration_and_effect_on_crime

&gt;military weapons.

If you mean assault rifles such as AK-47's and M-4 Rifles, civilians cannot own guns like that. ""Assault weapons"" was a bullshit term developed by the democrats to try and push gun legislation through congress. Basically, the bans/attempted bans on ""assault style weapons"" were to remove cosmetically scary looking guns from circulation, despite the fact these guns are hardly ever used in gun crimes anyways. Hand guns are the guns used in most homicides. To paint a humorous picture of the whole debacle with ""assault weapons,"" I give you the assault musket:  http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.glockforum.net/forum/attachments/glock-talk-discussion/1067d1359061954-assault-musket-musketscomparison.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.glockforum.net/forum/glock-talk-discussion/2635-assault-musket.html&amp;h=720&amp;w=864&amp;sz=533&amp;tbnid=4uuD6t21QUX88M:&amp;tbnh=85&amp;tbnw=102&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__RVyV5gLTr4G-fn263FPB6TEDVoQ=&amp;docid=et72nDRy5CpdGM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S-h1UbiqGOaa0QHln4GgBg&amp;ved=0CDQQ9QEwAA&amp;dur=386

Also, suicide accounts for over 2/3 of all gun deaths in America. This highlights how little an issue homicide with guns is in America.

This quote should be the creed of this sub reddit. America is not Europe, and Europe is not America. Any attempts to equate the two sidelines centuries of history and culture. To put American colonies with only a few decades of history and broadly shared a similar culture in the same breath of dozens of unique nation states with 1000 years of independent culture is a disservice to everyone. Us Americans carved out a country out of pre-existing british colonies. You Europeans (if you desire to fedaralize) face a significantly taller task. Keep in kind mind it took us considerable struggle and eventually a civil war to keep our union together...and we mostly spoke the same language and didn't have the thousands of years of history of war and conflict as a back drop during the evolution of our country. If this is what even a fraction of Europeans desire...good luck.

But to even make loose connections between the historical/cultural circumstances between the inflection points in our respective continents' trajectory is to do a great disservice to human history.

In particolare, per ""democrazia"" lui intende ""la vita pubblica da me controllata e comunque compatibile con i miei interessi"". In quest'ottica, si può essere sensibili alle sue linee guida (""democratici"") o autonomi/ostili (turisti, analfabeti).

Nella patologia speculare che consiste nel regolare la propria visione del mondo sul contrario di ciò che Berlusconi dice, quindi, la gente 5s diventa automaticamente l'associazione degli alfieri della democrazia.

Per troppo tempo, in questo Paese, Berlusconi ha ottenuto che si pensasse solo a suo favore oppure, grazie ad una sconfinata antipatia personale, naturale ma volutamente esasperata, che si pensasse solo contro di lui - e quindi sempre in un modo utile, manipolabile, sfruttabile.

Io penso che m5s sia un'associazione di persone che pretendono spazio nella vita pubblica, con tratti adolescenziali di immaturità e di aggressività inutile, ma che rappresentino una novità interessante in questa palude. Insomma, che abbiano del potenziale positivo, ancora tutto da sviluppare però.

Penso che il PD fosse il terzo del Parlamento con l'identità più fragile, la gestione più complessa, gli interessi più compositi. Insomma, un vaso di coccio. E quindi, crash, con tutto il patrimonio di competenza e perfino di onestà che molti di loro rappresentavano. Grazie anche ad una quantità ragguardevole di scelte del cazzo, devo dire.

Penso infine che Berlusconi, il modernizzatore per i suoi fans, sia un predatore efficientissimo ma malato e sciocco, che ha riportato l'orologio della vita politica e culturale del Paese indietro agli anni '50, e che comunque sia un uomo vecchio e vizioso che non tarderà ad andare a nutrire i vermi, e che se continuiamo a ragionare in funzione di lui gli facciamo un favore che non merita: lasciamo che a servirlo siano i suoi cortigiani, maschi e femmine, e cerchiamo di respirare aria.

In case of race to the bottom, that is not the only option to follow, another is to invest to education and new technology and new industries. If people in the developed world want to keep their standard of living they need to specialize more to knowledge intense industries and services that have world wide demand. Of course this has some implications. For example a long continuing world wide trend has been that there are two growing sectors in economies, the low skill low wage sector, and high knowledge and high wages sector. The reason why many people are finding things hard is because there is less and less demand for people in between these two sectors.
