true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;In the face of no evidence, the default position should be to not go ahead and say that amputation of the clitoris should be allowed. That said, there is evidence of how circumcision affects sexuality.

We have hundreds of years of functioning society with happy functioning individuals to go on. That seems at least as relevent as some statistics on orgasms.

&gt;More importantly however, it is you who believes that sexual satisfaction is not important. That's a far from from believing that your specific standards should be forcefully applied to children before they have a chance to make up their mind.

And it's you that believe that a notion of consent should be valid reason for dictating that societies that are satisfied with this aspect of their way of life ought to change. Presumably neither of us have any say, but why should your say trump entire societies?

Re pederasty, I have read things that suggest that it can be done in a non-harmful way, however I think given the massive taboo in our culture on the one hand and the fact that every pedophile I've chatted too online did not seem to care much really about that but used it as a shield for the fact of their own desires (they did not strike me as caring about the children really) I stick with an anti-pedophilia stance.

This is in marked contrast to mothers initiating their children into what they see as a prestigious society that will provide their children with many advantages or parents trying to discipline their children, both of which are frequently done with the best interests of the child at heart.

If your grandfather is ok and supportive of being hit with a hose I can't think it could have been that bad, but if he is crippled or something that's clearly a bad thing and if his parents did it not because they wanted to correct his behaviour but just out of anger or hatred that in my mind reflects very poorly on them.

true,DisregardMyPants,UNSA,United States,"&gt;I hope you do understand that France has the most farmed land in the EU, several times more than the UK and almost as much as Germany and Poland combined. 

Yes, which is why their position on the subsidy is self-serving. It'd be one thing if say - Portugal - was saying that it's important to have agriculture subsidized for ""food security""(what I've seen the French call it), but it's not. It's the primary beneficiary. It's little different than banks calling for the banks to be bailed out, or Oil companies calling for oil subsidies.

&gt;In recent times France has also become a net contributor to the EU, so I wouldn't say that they're getting more back by contributing this way, since like you've said, per capita, other countries are getting more.

They would be contributing about the same with or without the subsidies. This is just a way to claw back some of the funds they kick into the EU. It's a way for the country to benefit off of what would otherwise be spread outside of France.

&gt;Although the CAP is criticized intensively over here, it is ensuring food security for the EU and it is a form of protectionism so that EU farmers don't go out of business while also ensuring a level playing field when it comes to farming practices, animal welfare and environmental protection.

true,uututhrwa,null,null,"Thanks for those links. I can attest to this from my experience in Greece and I always found it wrong:

Before the crisis started the prime minister was Mr. Karamanlis. His administration just overspent money and pushed the debt to a new height. Say for example the annual costs of the health and welfare system doubled within a year from 2 billion to about 4.5. With not much perceivable difference for the average guy,for the most part it went to corruption. And it was all based on loans and not increased taxes of course.

So by 2009 his administration just quited. I mean there was no opposition or public outcry other than for the ""monks scandal"", but trust me the timing and context of how he called for  new elections, as well as his unusually low profile political campaign, were clearly showing he was ""handing over the government"", which was unheard of in greek politics until that point. Of course it had to do with the fact that he knew how bad the situation was about to get and he just abandoned the ship.

So Papandreou becomes the prime minister. In just a few months he is forced to seek for IMF intervention. It's not like he had another choice, I mean the ship was sinking. He could have just escaped like Karamanlis though. 

And this is what annoys me and what is relevant to those links. While it is clear that the previous overspending government lead us to a mess, and that they were cowards enough to run away from what they caused, the public outcry in Greece is not against them (who broke the rules) but against the next government that had no choice but to enforce them.

About your question, I would like to explore Europe. German culture seems to suit me. All the German people I've met have been great company, good friends and just my style. Of course that may be because they were open-minded travelers. I had a great time in the US, especially California, but I feel I'll also have a good time in Europe. Germany has the strongest economy in Europa naturally, plus a selfish reason is that since there is a high level of German required everywhere, maybe they won't outsource so much.

[The Wikipedia article offers a pretty comprehensive summary of the current consensus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_punishment_in_the_home#Effects_of_parental_corporal_punishment)

Keep in mind that the *best* thing that can be said about spanking is that it results in higher rates of immediate compliance at the expense of long-term compliance and even authorities that are neutral in regard to open-hand spanking are against any other form of harsher corporal punishment.

I disagree with a lot of Salmond's economic arguments, some are simply laughable, but at the same time someone arguing that Scotland can't afford it is inherently dishonest.  Of course they can.

Like I implied, a sovereignty argument trumps all.  If the level of sovereignty on independence is preferable, given that it is understood that Scotland wouldn't be controlling its currency and that it'd mean not having some of the same opt outs and vetoes of the rUK and somewhat having to find its own voting blocs in Europe, the sovereignty argument still trumps all.  As long as it is understood what it implies and what it means, that it's not used to foster animosity with the rUK, if, given all that is understood, then on balance if that's what Scotland chooses it's a valid argument.

There's lots of reasons, financial, social, as to why somebody shouldn't move out of their parent's house.  If on measure it's something somebody needs to do, and given that Scotland can afford it which clearly they can (although I don't think the SNP can even remotely deliver on some of their domestic policies - but that's a Scottish concern), then everything else pales to this argument.

Essentially the idea that Scotland can't afford it, or that it will deliver a breakdown in relations with the rest of the rUK, or that Scotland would be kept out of the EU, are all specious and unfounded.

true,cb43569,SCOT,Scottish Socialist Republic,"I'm sorry for being unnecessarily belligerent - stressful day! In any case, while we do indeed have representation, we elect only 59 of 650 MPs in Westminster, meaning that the entire country of Scotland is represented by fewer people than London, which alone elects 73. While ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"", I think you can see where the argument for independence comes from: Westminster will *never* prioritise Scotland over London, and that's damaging, considering that Scotland needs economic and social policy distinct from that which best serves Westminster. Do you think Alaska and Texas could successfully share a centralised government? Do you think a parliament permanently located in Texas could comprehend the needs of Alaska without having any idea of what it's like to live there?

Westminster essentially acknowledged the need for some degree of devolution when we got the first devolution referendum in the '70s, before Thatcher really devastated the economy up north with London-centric policies. Even though we voted in favour, we were screwed out of it, and had to wait until '97, under another government entirely, before we really got it, and then the Scottish Parliament reconvened in '99. Since then, we've diverged significantly politically. The NHS in England and Wales is being slowly privatised, while Scotland's is protected; Scotland even has no prescription fees, whereas England and Wales does. Tuition is vastly different: you can go to university *for free* in Scotland if you've lived here for a couple of years, whereas it can cost as much as £9,000 a year down south. Scottish Water? A state-owned company, compared to the private companies operating in England and Wales. Scots law? An entirely different legal system, distinct from that operating in England and Wales.

There are many more little differences which I can't care to list, which essentially add up to: with devolution, Scotland is becoming a very different part of the UK. Now, the argument against independence generally goes: ""if things are so good with devolution, why go further?"". Well, besides the fact that important things like welfare and pensions (supported in Scotland, being slashed by the UK Government) are still reserved to Westminster, there's the matter of Scotland's budget. We get it through something called the Barnett Formula, which, in recent years, means that the Scottish Government's budget is *smaller* than the tax revenue raised in Scotland. This essentially means Scots are paying tax that is going to Westminster instead of Holyrood. This means Holyrood's ability to continue delivering free tuition, for instance, is being threatened by a parliament where only 59 out of 650 people represent Scotland's best interests.

There was originally going to be a third option on our 2014 referendum which offered ""devolution max"", which would have been devolution to the extent that Scotland would receive every penny raised in the country, and would be able to legislate on welfare and pensions, etc. That option is no longer on the table - it was taken off the table by the UK Government, who have chosen instead to ""promise"" we'll get further devolution in the case of a ""No"" vote. The UK Government historically is not very good at sticking to its promises - Thatcher famously promised an alternative form of devolution should we reject the referendum in the '70s. We said *yes* to the referendum in the '70s and *still* received nothing. For *decades*!

Also, even devolution max wouldn't give us control over, say, defence. This may not strike you as particularly important, but right now, all of the UK's weapons of mass destruction are based on the Clyde, roughly thirty miles from Scotland's biggest city. They regularly [leak radioactive waste](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/may/18/mod-nuclear-waste-submarines) into the river.

My grandparents' generation would be the strongest ones to vote against it, yet, my grandparents would vote in favour for the simple reason that the Church lacks its old power of brainwashing.

Ireland is undergoing incredibly fast social change. The Church is losing its influence unbelievably fast. Only 50 years ago a Priest was an unquestionable authority in a community. 20 years ago, the Church had lost much power, but was still a voice of authority and the vast majority of citizens still identified as practising Catholics.

Now, most of the country are still Catholic. However, they are Catholic only by baptism, not by practise. Pretty much everyone I know has been baptised, yet I know few enough people my own age that go to Mass regularly that I could count them on my fingers. The Minister for Education is generally secular in his views and has been consistently moving towards reducing the prominence of religion in schools, although some of that is because chaplains are expensive.

So, yeah. The Catholic vote in Ireland is no longer a quantifiable portion of the electorate as so many people are Catholic but so few follow the faith nowadays.

An example.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Braden

&gt; In 1950, at the start of the Korean War, Braden joined the CIA and in 1950 became head of the International Organizations Division (IOD) of CIA's Office of Policy Coordination, the ""covert action"" arm of Agency secret operations, working closely with Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner. Believing that the cultural milieu of post-war Europe at the time was favorable toward left-wing views, and understanding that The Establishment of Western Allies was rigidly conservative and nationalistic as well as determined to maintain their colonial dominions, it was estimated that American supremacy would be best served by supporting the Democratic left. Thus, the program was begun by which more moderate and especially anti-Soviet leftists would be supported thereby helping to purge the social democratic left of Soviet sympathizers.

From the TV interview:

&gt; ""If the director of CIA wanted to extend a present, say, to someone in Europe — a Labour leader — suppose he just thought, This man can use fifty thousand dollars, he's working well and doing a good job — he could hand it to him and never have to account to anybody.... There was simply no limit to the money it could spend and no limit to the people it could hire and no limit to the activities it could decide were necessary to conduct the war — the secret war.... It was a multinational. Maybe it was one of the first. Journalists were a target, labor unions a particular target — that was one of the activities in which the communists spent the most money""

These 5,000 jobs harm entire local communities, these local communities have knock on effects.  Not only to local commerce, but to national living costs, social spending,.., it goes on.  A hundred jobs lost in a city does nothing.  A hundred jobs in a local town closes businesses, schools, creates crime, loses local investment... Now replicate it across a coastline and the cost nationally to social services is exponential.  Wales and much of the North East will be able to attest to the effect - as should Scotland with some reflection on not too distant history.  It's one thing to ignore something as insignificant to the greater whole, a problem the entire EU has shared too, yet the localised affect can throw a rogue domino. 

Again, I'm the person that argued that a Scottish need for sovereignty argument trumps all, beyond economic to a large extent.  It's a danger however to ignore the social ramifications, and the wider economic ripples.

It's almost a potential death of a 1,000 paper cuts.  Salmond and the SNP paint an unfair economic visage without a cruelly pragmatic outlook.  They talk of a bigger picture, and again I maintain Scotland can of course afford to be independent, and even in time do well, but how many times will a paring of economic edges sustain a seeming endless SNP onslaught on the back of an oil revenue that's already been largely spent on receipt  by an adopting share of UK debt?  It's a promise that's not his gift to give.

That's a purely Scottish concern, the social promises, in that it's already a devolved Scottish concern.  Yet it remains a cost that Scottish people should be aware of when deciding, and Salmond is being somewhat lenient with the hard truths.

Scotland is more than capable of paying for independence; but the hard truths should come out first.  Fishing is just one side of the minor quadrangle; military communities will be hard hit, finance without the UK fiscal opt outs will be hit, and without deficit reduction which the oil doesn't even touch - social spending.

Bueno, creo que el hombre se pierde un poco a veces, pero en lo de que la idea de España es algo sacadísimo de la manga es cierto. En realidad, y como dice, todas las naciones lo son. Pero la nuestraaa, telita –en connivencia por supuesto con las derechas y la Iglesia–. Yo creo que no hay que buscarle cinco pies al gato. La nación es un concepto sentimental, y por lo general arbitrario, y está claro que la nación española tal y como es hoy, tiene sus días contados.

A mi lo que me revienta de todo este tema, que ya cansa muchísimo, son tres cosas: una es el victimismo/derrotismo patético de muchos nacionalistas catalanes. Es muy guapo reivindicar todo esto ahora, tras haber sido arropados por un dictador fascista durante 40 años, que ha protegido –para pesar de todos– buena parte del deficiente tejido industrial catalán, y quejarse porque han pagado carreteras asturianas, en un claro ejercicio de *solidaridad* económica entre regiones; otra es la falsa pretensión de muchos, que buscan en ésto un culpable de todos sus males, en un contexto de crisis económica generalizada (léase España); y la última es ese odio que sienten algunos y que ha envuelto buena parte del nacionalismo catalán. A veces roza el surrealismo, en tanto que parece que ésto es una guerra entre Cataluña y Madrid, mientras los demás miramos desde las gradas, sin que nadie nos haga ni puto caso.

Que decidan irse o no, pues, me parece perfecto –no seré yo quien luche porque se queden–, pero sólo deseo que si por el camino de todo el proceso se saltan la ley, se actúe con firmeza, porque no son ni más ni menos que ningún otro pueblo de España.

In 2011, the trade union for economists and lawyers, DJØF, reported that 20% of its female members had been set back in their careers because of having children, with maternity leave affecting salary, training and advancement.

That's what happens when you have kids. I'm sorry, but it is entirely reasonable for companies to create safeguards. This is because it is relevant to the business if they are going to lack person X for *months* because the person wish to have kids. Ideally no, women should not face this kind of discrimination because they are the gender to get pregnant, but let us be reasonable. They are not giving anything to the company for a good amount of time and might decrease their workload when having kids, so is it not natural that they get set back in their careers in comparison to men? Is it equality if others who do not have kids must work much harder to advance? I don't think so.

Another thing on maternity leave. Do you think it is different for men if they take leave due to their kid? Of course it is not. This is not sex discrimination - it is a problem for people who have kids in general here.

The more significant question is *whether independence is something desirable for Scotland*. The rest of the UK wouldn't really mind either way- we could survive just fine without Scotland, and it's really not our place to dictate whether they stay or go. It just seems a shame to dump centuries of history after a few years of populist demagoguery and a (hopefully) brief period of Tory government- particularly in light of the enormous powers devolved to the Scottish parliament over the past decade.

But Scotland post independence would face the same sort of pressures that Ireland faces now, which results in a political debate which is not so much left-right, but more centred on national interest. That is why you see the SNP advocating a corporation tax cut, because arguably Scotland's national interest lies in undercutting London, to attract multinationals. That's why you see Alex Salmond saying things like this, just before the financial crisis:

&gt; ""We are pledging a light-touch regulation suitable to a Scottish financial sector with its outstanding reputation for probity, as opposed to one like that in the UK, which absorbs huge amounts of management time in 'gold-plated' regulation.""

There are couple of other major issues beyond that sort of low-tax, low-regulation approach. First, there's being progressive on social issues, I'd say that Britain used to be quite unpleasant there, but it has changed massively over the last 20 years. There are few countries in the world where the conservative party puts in place gay marriage legislation. Second, there's the anti-privatization agenda. I think there would be a difference in that respect, but privatization is something which is ongoing everywhere, not least pushed by the Commission and the Single Market. And people in Britain are similarly anti-privatization, but have little effect on policy.

1. What cities you decide to visit should be based upon what you want to see. For example, if you want to see a lot of modern art and architecure, you should head to Berlin. If walking along the river with Baroque buildings is more your speed, visit Dresden. Beer maniacs should head towards Munich, and a personal favorite of my is the beautiful town of Freiburg im Breisgau, along the southern tip of the Black Forest. There you can find the fabled Black Forest Cake, enjoy the warm sunshine and great food! It is a mix of France and Germany, with Strasbourg being no more than an hour away :)

2. Vodafone or O2 have decent prepaid plans. Here is the guide I used http://phone-guide-germany.com/overview-prepaid-plans-germany/4299/

3. I prefer cash myself, as everyone accepts cash and if you go to a small village, you won't have to worry about not being able to pay with a card. Outside of main department stores and chains, I get funny looks whenever I use my debit card. There have even been times when my card wasn't accepted and a friend of mine had to pay for my meal. 

4. If you plan on traveling more than 3 hours every travel day, then a railpass makes the most sense. If you only travel on the weekends, there are lots of cheap travel options for pairs, including the Schönes Wochenende (Happy/Beautiful Weekend) ticket. This allows unlimited travel via regional trains until 4am the next day for about 42-46 euros/2 people (check bahn.de for more info on tickets). There are also the Ländertickets (State tickets) where you can travel a federal state for about 30 euros/2 people.

true,razzberri1973,,Tourist,"Not a Parisian, I live in Canada...but I've taken a couple of trips to Paris. I'm no expert by any means, but I can offer some suggestions based on my own experiences :)

You don't need a car...look up videos of Paris traffic and you'll quickly see why. I've been to a LOT of North American cities and trust me, I've never seen drivers like I've seen over there...hoo boy, it's nuts! Paris has a very efficient and extensive public transit system. You can take the Metro or bus to where you want to go. Study the maps before you go, and learn how to use the ticket machines and what-not, so that you don't end up holding up lines or bumbling around upsetting people :) Link here: http://www.ratp.fr/en/ratp/c_21879/tourists/

Here is the map guide I use there. It is small and I carry it in my purse so I have easy access to it. http://www.amazon.ca/Paris-Mapguide-2e-Michael-Middleditch/dp/0141469048  

If you want a unique experience and aren't one to be waited on by room service and don't mind cleaning up after yourself and cooking your own meals, rent an apartment instead of a hotel. We've done so through two agencies so far (Perfectly Paris, and Haven in Paris...both very awesome to deal with, fast, helpful, trust-worthy) and it's truly the best way to experience the city, pretend to be a local, get to know your neighbourhood, etc. Price-wise, it's comparable, even cheaper, than renting a hotel room for a week. It just depends on how high-end you're going with. Some apartments are over 2000 euro per week...the last one we rented was a nice 1 bedroom, big by Paris standards, and it was 850 euro (so, roughly 120 euro/night...comparable to a modest hotel, but with TONS more space to spread out), so just like with hotels, it depends on what amenities you want.

If you want to go over to London, the Eurostar train takes about 2 hours. There is also a train to Amsterdam which takes roughly 4 hours. I've not done either trip, but had looked into it and train travel seems to be the way to go. If you think about it, to fly you have to be at the airport like 2 hours before your flight. To get out to the airport is a hassle in the first place, and there is a lot of waiting around. With the Eurostar to London, you go to the train station, get on your train, and bang, you're there in 2 hours. More efficient, in my opinion.

Even if you want to do some day-trips, the train is the way to go. You can take the train to Versailles to see the palace, or out to Vernon then taxi/bike into Giverny to see Monet's house and gardens. We took the train to a town called Melun, then taxi to a chateau called Vaux-le-Vicomte, which was the inspiration for Versailles...it's a nice little trek out of the city for a few hours...not even an entire day trip, which left us free to do other stuff once back in town. In my opinion, driving a car through foreign countries would add stress, gas is very expensive overseas as well. May as well take the train, sit back, have a drink or two and watch the countryside roll by while you relax and let someone else do the driving :)

If you have any questions re: apartment rental agencies or anything like that, let me know.

* Automobiles Not on your life - Paris driving is fairly insane, parking is horribly expensive &amp; most of the time going by car will take you longer than the metro / RER - grab a good phone app for the Metro (most cover the RER as well) and jump on-board. While we were in France we rented a car for a single day to tour the Loire Valley - but only after getting there by train.
* Hotel We stayed in an apartment so can't much comment on Hotel style accommodation - the one hint would be to look at getting somewhere close enough to walk to places as strolling around was when we found all kinds of cool things.
* Trains v. Planes The trains are the way to go - trains in Paris dump you usefully on a metro line, and although the RER takes you to most of the airports it's a fair trip - by the time you add in the time you have to be at the airport to check-in (90? mins for planes 5 for trains) you will find that for most trips the trains are actually quicker. You can get sleeper overnight trains for longer trips which may save you a nights accommodation (We didn't try this as we had an apartment) The trains are generally very comfortable, roomy, have decent eating options and even internet access (usually free for first class) so you can reddit as you travel. Most trains terminate right in the middle of the places you want to be - rather than the usual air-port experience of having to work out how to transfer once you land. We did a couple of flights (Sweden &amp; the UK) and the trains were a much more pleasant experience. Even to the UK the chunnel is a pretty straightforward &amp; avoids the absolute pain that appears to be most UK airports.

The one thing that I would do differently is not use a eurail (or equivalent) pass - the passes had so much restrictions on available seats, combined with 'reservation fees' that it was often the same price to get a cheap ticket.

Travel to Germany - where? Berlin? Fly. Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich and anything in-between, take the train.
To England, if you book the train in advance it is pretty reasonable and it is an experience. Not many places in the world have such a feat of engineering.

true,Mareeena,SHOL,Schleswig-Holstein,"Ooo! Kiel! That's near where I am from!! Kiel is not a typical location for study abroad programs as far as I am aware.

Here is some random info that may help you though.

**General Info:**

If you are going to get a cellphone just buy a cheap pay as you go phone and SIM card. You can top up your account pretty much anywhere.

Travel by train! The Deutsche Bahn has many different options for cheap trips! There are the state tickets (Ländertickets) that allow you to travel anywhere within the certain state you are in for a set price. For example the Schleswig Holstein Ticket allows you to travel as much as you want throughout the state (as well as Mecklenburg Vorpommern AND Hamburg) in one day for 27 Euros for one person and 3 Euros for every additional person. So if you get a lot of people together it will be very cheap! http://www.bahn.de/regional/view/regionen/schholst/freizeit/schholdt_ticket.shtml

Eat a Fischbrötchen! (A fish bun?) There will be a lot of little stands in and around Kiel that will be selling these and they are really yummy and very typical for the area. Also eat a Döner!! Yum!

**Kiel:**

Kiel is the capital and largest city of Schleswig Holstein. The city has quite a few students and a pretty decent night life. There are tons of clubs, bars, and pubs spread across the city. The only club I have been to is Max: http://www.max-kiel.de/ , which is pretty good in my opinion but since I haven't been to others in the city I can't compare it.

The Kieler Woche is a REALLY awesome event that happens in the city at the end of June. It is actually one of the largest festivals in Germany. It has many different fun things to do, like concerts, food and beer stands, craft stands, ships coming in from many different countries, etc. Here is the website: http://www.kieler-woche.de/ (the English button is just on the side)

If you want to go swimming at the beach, it's best to go outside the city centre and head up to either Schilksee or Laboe, which have really nice sand beaches.

There is an old U-Boot and navy museum in the area that you can go see. I haven't been there myself but I have heard that it is pretty neat to see. Here is a link: http://www.deutscher-marinebund.de/u995_geschichte_english.htm

Because Kiel is not a usual destination for tourists there will not be as much English spoken as say in Berlin or Munich, but this will allow you to work on your German without having people automatically switch to English. (And don't worry most people can speak English decently.)

**Some places you should visit:**

Lübeck: the second largest city in Schleswig Holstein, and is the prettiest in my opinion. Has a lovely downtown area to walk around, lots of shopping opportunities, little theatres, and cute pubs. Travemünde beach nearby is also really nice!

Hamburg: The second largest city in Germany. TONS of things to do and see. Very nice downtown area to walk around, the Speicherstadt (old trading area) is cool to see, lots of clothing and electronic stores, bigger concerts, the HSV soccer team plays here if you wish to see a Bundesliga game, etc etc.

Of course it is. The UK once had a law allowing criminals to be executed. We changed that law because it was no longer fit for purpose (and arguably was always a mistake). Does France honestly argue that everything the EU ever does will be fit for purpose for all time? That is more extreme that the US constitutionalist faith.

I never said your link was wrong you idiot, but you refuse to accept the truth.

Greece was 4-6 TIMES LARGER then modern day greece, it was a massive piece of land and many parts of it WERE scarcely populated.

Do you think albanians were brought to Crete? or Rhodes? or the dozens of other islands? or Sparta? Or athens? or Thessaloiniki? Ofcourse not . . . these are the places where the ancient greeks populated and there ancestors who became the orthodox greeks settled and lived until this day.

Now for the other 50% of greece, IT WAS scarcely populaed. The greek northern borders extended up to serbia, so many albanians/FYROM'ians were brought to these lands, and many of these people were brought to Turkey, Many were also broight to Constainople as labor force also since there was always building projects going on there. . . but the heartland of greece (sparta/athens/thessaloniki/islands) there were millions of greeks who descended from the ancients. . . in your sick gypsy brain . . . do you really think the ancients just packed there bags and moved or something? Do you understand there were millions of ancient greeks. . . that were very powerful even during Roman occupation, and were NEVER conquered until the Ottomans came . . and even under the ottomans there were no holocausts to destroy the greeks.

This is one thing gypsies like yourself need to understand,  greeks even in modern times strictly ONLY breed/marry with greeks with a deep greek heritage meaning if you have an albanian last name or look albanian a greek girl/boy will not touch them.

Modern greeks are crazy about this sort of thing . . there are scandals when greeks marry italians and greeks consider italians to be equals . . its not because they do not like italians but because it is ingrained in our culture to only marry other greeks . . AND THIS IS MODERN TIMES.

In Ancient times it was the same thing but 10000x more strict, remember in ancient times albanians/fyromians/etc were considered and widely accepted as ""sub-humans"" . . . a greek could and would not breed with someone like that.

Someone like a fyromian would not understand how proud greek people are . . . greek society was never a ""immigrant"" ""multi-culture"" where greeks and albanians danced in circles together and married each other . . . greeks never accepted other cultures or would ever betray there country/culture by marrying and breeding with an albanians etc.

This is not saying albanians are not in Greece you stupid gypsy . . there are many albanians/gypsies in greece in modern times, they have there own communities and even in MODERN TIMES greeks kids are taught not to talk/be friends with them . . . in my island, I have never heard of a girl being in a relationship with an albanians let alone marry one . . It just does not happen, EVER. . . I am greek, I am trying not to be racist even though I know it will sound racist to modern-minded people but greek is an old-school place.

What your doing is projecting by saying "" you are descended from albanians,slavs,vlachs"" YOU PEOPLE ARE.

Remember Greeks have always considered Albanians/fyromians/slavs to be sub-humans, there was no ""multi-cultural"" society where greeks and albanians breed together .  . this is proven by these albanians who were brought to greece the Arvanites.

The Arvanites did not mix with the greek population . . but still lived among them. . . they sticked to there own people and were and still are bi-lingual to this day and proud of there albanian history.

I will give you an example since you still do not understand. Where I live in Greece (Rodos) . . there are many albanians, my next door neihbor is albanians and they are everywhere and live peacefully with greeks. From a young age all greek children are taught to not talk or be friends with albanians adn to stick only to other greek children to play with. This is just how it is over there . . the cultures live peacefully together but DO NOT interact or mix with each other. . . a greek girl who married an albanians would be COMPLETELY shunned by her family/friends .. it is unheard of .  . . it is a common insult between friends in greece to call someone albanian .  . this is like saying you are a piece of garbage. 

This is MODERN TIMES! In Ancient/Byzantine times it was 1000x more extreme. . . these greek people who lived during these times truly believed the slavs/albanians to be complete sub-humans, there was no mixing as greek children were taught never to interact.

I am not saying it NEVER happened . . . but to say the ancient greek blood does not exist is CRAZY and only a FYROM'ian would say that because they are jealous.

There were MILLIONS of ancient greeks, they did not dissapear and only became more powerful under Roman Rule up until 1400 AD!!! Please give ME a link or explain how these millions of greeks dissapeared. 

You do not understand that the Greece of today and roman era was much different. Byzantine greece was 4-6 TIMES LARGER, that is why arvanites were brought to scarecely populated areas of the empire. Remember at this time ALL OF MODERN TURKEY WAS CONSIDERED GREECE. There was no such thing as turkey back then . . it was GREECE.

The dialect is more alive in the province. But is it Milanese? I grew up 30 km north from Milan, and the dialect my granma spoke was absolutely NOT milanese, it was similar but was a distinct dialect. 

How long have you been living in Milan? When was the last time a stranger addressed you in Milanese? How often do you hear someone having a conversation in Milanese? 

After having studied in Milan and having frequented the city daily for 15 years, and after having lived in Milan for 3 years, my answer is that nobody ever addresses you in Milanese, and that you never hear a conversation at the bar in Milanese. My girlfriend has lived all her life in Milan and she can't even speak a single word in dialect. If it was as common as you assume, she would have at least learned some word, don't you think?

true,bigos,SILE,"a bird on a flag ","Your feelings are not compatibile with urban planner's experience anywhere.

What you wrote about something being ""culturally wrong"" is borderline fascist and ultimately stupid. There's no thing in the world that could be described as ""culturally wrong"", these words don't even go together in a sentence.

Second, I don't know where you got this idea that we need ""more active, competitive, challenging, more masculine, higher-adrenaline culture"". I don't see how such culture (somehow attained by allowing faster driving (?!)) is desirable, or how does it bring us more peace, wealth or equality. If anything, I'd say it causes the opposite.

Third, even if we say we want what you describe as ""buzz"" (LOL), I don't see how road deaths might lead to that.

Let me tell you what does higher speed roads mean:

- **noise** - and this is the most important thing. Faster vehicles generate unproportionately louder noise. This is a major problem in the cities, where people continously live in a sound polluted enviroment. It's almost always overlooked and nobody mentions that living in noisy enviroment is a **health hazard** weakening immunity system, raising stress levels, destroying sleep patterns etc. This is a **major** life quality hit.
- pollution - cars generate an absurd amount of pollution. To the point that the air in the cities *smells* of combusted gasoline. Faster driving vehicles generate more pollution.
- congestion - there are too many cars already. They just don't fit in our streets anymore. The naive solution to this problem was widening the road. Let's just build another lane! This is how you end up with a clusterfuck of the size of Atlanta. As it turned out, wider roads just attract more cars and in effect **decrease** average vehicle speed, which effectively increases traffic jams AND pollution AND noise. The correct way is to eliminate or drastically reduce individual transport from places that reach their transport capacity (dense urban areas, city centers) and only rely on public transport.
- area fragmentation and killing life - nobody want to shop on a highway. Nobody want to drink coffee/beer where there are cars 3m from your table. You won't go for a walk with your wife and kids on a 1m wide sidewalk by the highway. It would be a tiring nightmare, wouldn't it? Then why should be build such a nightmare? Cities are for  living in them, not for making them a living hell of noise and gasoline reek. Also, how do you walk througfh a city that is sliced by Autobahn through? You need to either climb the stairs or deal with the streetlights or cross in an unsafe spot. And his is only annoying if you're young and healthy single man. What if you're on a wheelchair? Fuck you, then, no crossing for you, go live your life surronded by four Autobahns. What if you're a single mother with babies? Fuck you, too, hopefully your kids get under a truck, right? Fuck them, and their unhealthysinglemanly way of life.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Can you link me something where I can see higher subsdies for the same product in France than in Sweden. The only thing i know for a fact is that newer members benefit less from CAP, and slowly get the same level of subsidy.

Of course I can. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/17h786/should_the_european_union_continue_as_a_monetary/c85qtgs) is a rather lengthy comment where I discuss how the French gets paid more for having the exactly the same amount of cows, living the exact same way etc. You see, to make sure that the French get paid more, they have added a clause, that has no bearing on the quality of the life of the cow, the end product etc - the number of trees in the pasture where the cows graze. 

France have *refused* to change that clause, since 1995. There are a lot of clauses like that, that affects countries that are not France/Spain etc.As with the reforms, that is *not* changing in 2013, along with a lot of other stuff that is not changing, that is wrong. 


However, the CAP has changed some things, which is good, the support for tobacco for example, more focused on environmental issues etc (from being very low)
.
&gt;Plus, when France gets more subsidies for agriculture, it gets less on others sectors. If not how can it be a net contributor ?

Perhaps I misunderstand you, but it is not a zero sum game. It is not like at the beginning of the year  the EU gathers and decides ""France is getting a 100 total, Spain 60, Sweden 8 etc - use it however you want"". The EU has decided to hand out money based on a lot of factures, like finances, size, agriculture - well you know there's about a million things you can get support for. So, the money France gets for its farming has no bearing on how much they will receive from the structural fund.


The fact is that France is not the country that gets most of the agricultural subsidies, no matter how one counts, but it is getting much more than its fair share,  if one is striving to have a fair, financially sound etc CAP, France should get less. France would still get a lot, mind you since it is a big agricultural country, but not more. 

But, the true problem is that France is the biggest and loudest champion of the CAP. If you look at the statistic on how much money each country receives, nothing makes any sense. [Here](http://www.reformthecap.eu/key-data-on-the-cap) is a list of how much money the countries receive in 2013, and honstely, it makes no sense what so ever. Why is Greece so high? The Netherlands? 

Honestly, the reformation hasn't been that thorough, and in a way I do think it is harming France too, at least it tax payers, and at the end of the day, its consumers who pays more than they should.

Problem 1: Were they tortured or not? We know that either these guys were heavily armed and ready to use their weapons or they weren't. 

In case they were heavily armed and ready to use their weapons (as the government implies) then it makes no sense for the police to approach them for melee combat. Therefore, there either was a shootout or they surrendered peacefully. But we know for a fact that there was no shootout. It makes zero sense that they first surrendered their weapons but then decided to resist arrest. If they wanted to resist arrest they would use their guns. In conclusion, this scenario is contradictory with the evidence. 

In the other case, i.e. they did not have their weapons ready, then it still doesn't make any sense for the police to beat them so much. The police had the advantage in numbers, they could just overwhelm them and stop them. Does it make sense to you that if 10-20 people try to apprehend 4 that there is a fully-fledged fight? (I'm making the assumption here that they police greatly outnumbered these guys, perhaps I'm wrong?)

Furthermore, many of the injuries make no sense. What kind of fight is it that all of the suspects end up with injuries in both their eyes? You can't easily injure your eye in a fight, can you?

Problem 2: The mugshots. The government says that they were edited to make them more recognisable. However, most of the edits do not really contribute to making them more recognisable, they actually make them less recognisable (check for yourself!). In one instance, the photograph was lightened so much that the suspect’s hair turned from brown to blond.  

All of these little inconsistencies and improbabilities make the actions of the police and the government look extremely suspicious. That's all I'm claiming; nothing more, nothing less. (For the record: I'm making no claim on whether these guys are guilty or not for the bank robbery.

&gt; The earliest and most important cult site of Eros in ancient Greece was at Thespiae in Boeotia, where a monolithic aniconic cult statue represented the god. Dedications to Eros at Thespiae featured statues by major Classical and Hellenistic sculptors, among them Praxiteles and Lysippos. In Classical and Hellenistic Athens, Eros was worshipped with Aphrodite in a sanctuary on the north slope of the Acropolis and in a temple by the Ilissos River. Images of Eros are recorded in the Hellenistic period among the temple treasures of the Athenian Acropolis. In the coastal city-state of Megara near Athens, a temple of Aphrodite housed the famous statue of the goddess and her three sons—Eros (Love), Pothos (Longing), and Himeros (Desire)—by the Late Classical sculptor Skopas. Eros was also worshipped at gymnasia and in domestic shrines as well as at diverse religious festivals. The cult of Eros had many different aspects. As the god of love, he was a major figure in courtship and marriage rituals. Like his mother, Aphrodite, Eros received offerings of thanks in the form of precious vessels, jewelry, and other objects in addition to sacrifices made in his honor. For the ancient Greeks, Eros symbolized all attractions that provoke love. As a cosmic primordial deity tied to creation, he is frequently associated with plants and fecundity. The rose was his sacred flower. Greek philosophers from Plato to Epikouros reflected on his power and its centrality to human existence.

* [Sleeping Eros from Roman Imperial Times to the Renaissance](http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2013/sleeping-eros/from-roman-imperial-times-to-the-renaissance)

&gt; To judge from the hundreds of replicas, the sleeping Eros and its many adaptations and variations—as sleeping Cupids and even Somnus, the Roman personification of sleep—were especially popular during the Roman Imperial period. Particularly notable are the diverse contexts in which these sculptures were displayed. As in the Hellenistic period, statues of sleeping Eros continued to be offered as dedications at sanctuaries, but they also decorated Roman public baths, fountains, and private villas. The type was well suited for funerary use, and sleeping Eros/Cupid sculptures became popular tomb monuments, especially those made for children. The image was adapted for a wide variety of uses, from its appearance in relief on sarcophagi, marble urns, and altars to mosaics, wall paintings, gold jewelry, terracotta lamps, and an array of other objects.

&gt; During the Italian Renaissance the recovery of ancient sculptures, such as the Laocoön, found in the Roman emperor Nero's Golden House in the early sixteenth century, inspired artists such as Michelangelo to adapt classical styles to their own work. The sleeping Eros was among the earliest types rediscovered, and it is known that Michelangelo, early in his career, made one that he passed off as an ancient sculpture. Indeed, the sleeping Eros was the subject of numerous figural studies by Renaissance and Baroque artists who were looking to the classical tradition for inspiration. These works were sometimes close likenesses or less literal interpretations",0,1360158019,null,0,false,0,c8abri4,t3_17zxgf,t1_c8abri4,t3_17zxgf,null,1431208564,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You people seriously think you have ANYTHING to do with macedonians and at the same time talk shit about greeks not being ancient greek blood . . do you know how crazy that is?

Anyway, I never said the arvanites did not exist, they did . . but they are still considered albanian by modern greeks not full greeks.

There is a reason they still speak albanian you idiot.

Anyway as far as depopulation, that is because GREECE was a vast empire that stretched up to the mountains of serbia in the north and to Syria to the East. That is why many arvanites were brought to these areas, you still do not understand or comprehend how big Greece was during at this time. 

The Link I gave you is an extensive DNA study comparing DNA structures between countries. ITALY AND GREECE are connected to each other. The albanians/slavs are not even close to the DNA structure.

I do not doubt that many arvanites mixed with greeks, especially the great warriors who fought for greek independence . . but you are trying to say that millions of Greeks who lived in the heartland of greece were overtaken by less then 50,000 arvanite immigrants?

Think about this . . . Alexander the Great was born in PELLA, GREECE right next to Athens during the peak of the greek empire . . and you people still think you have connection to Alexander . . you FYROM'ian gypsies insist that you have more connection to the Ancient greeks the greeks themselves!! Do you not understand why everyone on earth think you people are pathetic?

The inflation is a debtor's friend and a creditor's nightmare.

In the context of euro zone, the inflation is just another way to transfer the wealth from creditor countries to debtor countries.

You sound like the average, typical left-liberal. Well I am not. I tend to think outside of the common boxes they teach everybody to think in. So as far as I am concerned screw more peace or equality. Wealth, that is OK. I want more success, I want more power, I want more excitement, achievement,  skills made razor-sharp by competition, glorious achievements awed by the world and fast-paced technological progress. Equality or peace are the most boring concepts ever. Anyone can be perfectly peaceful and equal by being dead.  Our goal should be to get more alive. My motto: admire peopl for what they do, not for what they don't do.

Anyway, to the practical stuff:

Your basic mistake is keeping confusing downtowns with cities on the whole. You shown a photo of a downtown, talk about shopping etc. it is all typically downtown thing. Cars don't really belong to downtowns. Downtowns, residential streets are for living, not every road. The normal purpose of cars is to cover that kind of transportation that is not covered by public: from suburb to suburb, from suburb outside the city, etc. not in the downtown.

&gt;congestion - there are too many cars already.

Yes, in typical suburbia-downtown routes. That is indeed should be replaced by public transport. Parking is shitty anyway, so whenever people drive to downtown they feel like strangling someone, park spaces are so scarce. So of course downtown driving must be reduced. But cars are actually for everything else. All the other directions and uses.

BTW I would believe in multiple lane solutions, because this process you mentioned can only go until everybody has a car. Nobody can drive two cars at the same time. So it is just temporary that they attract more traffic. But it is a theoretical stuff anyway because there is simply no room in European cities for more lanes.

An Autobahn through a city is not nice for those who happen to live around it, but only a few of those are necessary (with high speed limits) and it can take the through-going traffic out of the downtown, out of the residental areas. Slowing that down helps a very few locals while harms many many throughpassers.

This for example is glorious: http://goo.gl/maps/h5Cvp only a small number of people are affected, but a very large number can cross the city in a typically non-commuter, so non-public-transport direction.

The general problem with this very idea is that it would affect every residential area all over the continent. 

In reality there are different neighborhoods with different logical rules. There are pedestrian streets. There are almost pedestrian streets like 10km /h areas. There are 30 km/h areas, 50, 70. They are in different neighborhoods, serving different needs. Councils are actually often good at figuring it out. 

So we must resist every one size fits all solution like this that would treat an inner city shopping street the same way as the road going to a suburbian industrial center.

Here are two excellent examples of roads where even 50 is too low, even 70 does not disturb everyone because it is not downtown, and they cannot be replaced by public,

in this first example because it is not a commuter direction: 

http://goo.gl/maps/hZEGV

second example wide sidewalks, general lack of living or shopping, long distance, low density:

http://goo.gl/maps/zPP3i


Of course 30 makes sense for downtown streets. Even full pedestrianization does. But there is much more to cities than downtowns or residential areas. My goal is generally stopping auto-hatred *outside* the downtown/residential area.

true,zmsz,DENK,Denmark,"It really is one of the most complex issues when it comes to the nordic welfare states, and besides from some added drama in the article, the picture it paints is fairly true.

The Nordic welfare state, and the underlying sense of trust and commitment to the community necessary to keeping it afloat, is something we 'natives' often take for granted. But I really think the difficulties we face integrating people from foreign cultures are primarily based on an inability to teach this sense of community to our new members.

IMO, the rules of more economically liberal societies, like the US, are much more easily conveyed to for example a Somalian refugee. Because the more individualistic work-or-die culture (I'm exaggerating, but still) that you see in america compares better to cultures where social commitment restricts itself to the clan or the family.

As opposed to this, Nordic welfare states are based on a sense of community that spans the entire nation - not an individual or a family. We might not think much of this, since its deeply rooted in the minds of most of us. But that really takes a lot of 'formal compassion' (for lack of better words), which *needs to be taught*.

Despite the difficulties, I strongly believe a country like Denmark should remain open towards immigration. Just because teaching this sense of community is difficult doesn't mean it's impossible. And we've only dealt with the issue in an extremely short period of time - compared to the thousands of years of historical homogeneity that served as basis for this society. Finally, we're absolute noobs when it comes to integration on a global scale compared to countries like GB or USA. 

I really think that the Nordic welfare state is the best way of organizing a society in the modern world (possibly bias, I know), and i hope for everyone to be able to live in something similar one day.

&gt;Auch die Zahl der Zeugen ist niedergeschrieben worden, mögen diese auch singuläre sein, indem z.B. der eine ausgesagt hat, sie habe ihm das Kind behext, der andere aber, das Vieh, der dritte über den schlechten Leumund, und so bei den anderen, so stimmten sie doch in der Substanz der Tat überein, nämlich in dem Schadenszauber und dass sie als Hexe verdächtig sei.

Monty Python [war gar nicht so weit von der Wahrheit entfern...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrzMhU_4m-g)

&gt;Zum ersten ist zu bemerken, dass der Anwalt nicht nach dem Gutdünken des Angezeigten bestellt wird. Nämlich weil er einen nach seinem Wohlgefallen haben wollen würde, möge sich der Richter durchaus hüten, diesbezüglich einen streitsüchtigen, böswilligen Mann zuzulassen, der sich leicht mit Geld bestechen lassen könnte, wie man es oft findet.

&gt;Er möge ihm vielmehr einen rechtschaffenden Mann zukommen lassen, der bezüglich seiner Rechtschaffenheit keinen Verdacht erweckt.

Hier darf man nicht vergessen, dass im Inquisitionsprozess der Richter auch gleichzeitig Ankläger ist.

&gt;[...] Der Richter möge die zuvor beschriebenen Bedingungen dem Anwalt vorlegen und am Schluss noch mahnen, dass er sich keiner Begünstigung der Ketzerei schuldig mache, weil er dann exkommuniziert würde.

Unter Begünstigung versteht Kramer auch das Einlegen von zu vielen Einsprüchen. Zugang zu den Namen der Anschuldiger bekommt der Anwalt übrigens nicht. Ob man unter diesen Umständen noch von einer fairen Verteidigung sprechen kann?

&gt;Was zuletzt vom Richter zu tun ist, ist klar. Dass nämlich, wie es allgemeine Gerechtigkeit erfordert, niemand zur Todesstrafe verurteilt wird, wenn jemand nicht durch das eigenen Geständnis überführt wird. Da sie aber [...] für eine offenkundig in ketzerischer Verkehrtheit Ertappte gehalten wird, [...] so wird sie dann jedenfalls zur Erlangung eines Geständnisses der Verbrechen den peinlichen Fragen und Foltern ausgesetzt.

Das Gesetz fordert ein Geständnis für die Toddesstrafe und die Angeklagte schweigt? Dann bleibt einem wohl nichts anderes übrig als die Folter. Auf das zitieren der detaillierten Anweisungen zur Folter verzichte ich mal, ist ja noch vor 22 Uhr.

Nun ja, glücklicherweise muss man nur lange genug aushalten, ein Wiederholen der Folter ist ja verboten und wer trotz aller Bemühungen nicht gesteht, gilt als unschuldig, oder?

&gt;Viertens besteht der Akt darin, wenn der in mäßiger Weise peinlich Verhörte die Wahrheit nicht hat gestehen wollen, vor ihm andere Arten von Folterwerkzeugen mit den Worten hingelegt werden, dass er sie aushalten müsse, wenn er die Wahrheit nicht gestehe.

&gt;Wenn er auch so nicht in Furcht versetzt und zur Wahrheit gebracht werden kann, dann wird in seiner Gegenwart das Urteil auf Fortsetzung des peinlichen Verhörs auf der Folter für den zweiten und dritten Tag, nicht auf Wiederholung – da die Folter nicht wiederholt werden darf, wenn nicht neue Indizien hinzugekommen sind – in folgender Weise vorgetragen:

&gt;&gt;Und wir Vorgenannten, bestimmen für dich, den und den Tag zur Fortsetzung des peinlichen Verhörs, damit aus deinem eigenen Mund die Wahrheit herauskomme.

Ist es unter diesen Umständen verwunderlich, dass Friedrich von Spee, Jesuit und selbst als Beichtvater Beteiligter an Hexenprozessen, folgendes in Cautio Criminalis schrieb: 

&gt;Zwar hätten ich es von Rechts wegen immer wieder an vielen Orten sehen müssen, und doch habe ich es erst ganz selten wirklich erlebt, dass eine Angeklagte losgelassen worden wäre, die sich bei der ersten Tortur mit standhaftem Bestreiten ihrer Schuld gereinigt hätte.

&gt;Nur sehr ungern und wirklich kaum jemals wird eine freigelassen, die erst einmal ins Gefängnis gekommen ist.

Und um nur mal vor Augen zu führen, was einen hochgläubigen, geweihten und ordinierten Priester dazu geführt hat, zur Hochzeit der Hexenverfolgung eine Anklageschrift gegen eben diese zu verfassen, hier noch ein Auszug aus dem Cautio zur Folter selbst:

&gt;26) Ob dann die Gaja auf der Folter vor Schmerz die Augen verdreht oder sie starr auf einen Fleck heftet: Das sind neue Indizien. Verdreht sie die Augen, so heißt es: Seht ihr, wie sie ihren Buhlen sucht? Heftet sie sie starr auf einen Fleck, so sagt man: Schaut, sie hat ihn schon gefunden, sie sieht ihn bereits.

&gt;Bricht sie jedoch trotz mehrmaliger Folterung immer noch nicht ihr Schweigen, verzerrt sie im Ankämpfen gegen die Schmerzen ihr Gesicht, erleidet sie eine Ohnmacht usw., dann schreien sie, sie lache, sie schlafe in der Tortur, sie gebrauche einen Schweigezauber und sei nun umso mehr schuldig, sie gehörte deshalb lebendig verbrannt zu werden.

&gt;[...] Geschieht es aber, dass irgendeine Angeklagte unter solchen Folterqualen den Geist aufgibt, dann behaupten sie, der Teufel habe ihr das Genick gebrochen. [...]

&gt;[...] Stirbt die Gaja aber nicht [...], dann wird sie im Kerker festgehalten, in festere Ketten gelegt, um dort bis zu einem vollen Jahr mürbe gemacht zu werden, solange bis sie unterliegt.

&gt;Wen [die Inquisitoren] erst einmal gefangen haben, der muss um jeden Preis schuldig sein.

It effectively does. The UN operates by one nation, one vote. And when you do the numbers, counting the nations that are either (A) routinely censorious, or (B) in the pocket of a telecom monopoly, you get enough to railroad through most anything.

They're at most ministries, not heads of the internet governments.

If the US ever thinks of influencing them in any other way than how to report their budget to tax authorities etc, that is, things pertaining to their incorporation in the US, the rest of the internet will be most happy to drop them.

Hylland Eriksen said it best. The most important thing at the moment is to deconstruct the majority (Nordics) and make sure they can never attain a majority ever again.

Making Nordics less homogenous is the end goal of this exercise.
Cultural enrichment. Every day we hear that our culture, if it even exists, is absolute shit. How all other cultures are better in every conceivable way. We're extremely sexist, and especially Sweden is made up from grumpy old sexist, racist, *white* men. 

Personally, I'm quite curious to see where liberalists go with this. The majority of the political parties in Sweden are in favour of open immigration. http://www.di.se/artiklar/2013/1/11/majoritet-av-partierna-ar-for-fri-invandring/

They will continue flooding Sweden with MENA immigration, despite companies clamouring for highly educated specialists.
 I wonder what the impact will be on the welfare state. Even if it only takes ~10 years for an immigrant to join the workforce, that's 10 years where the Swedes need to prop him up. Pay for his healthcare, dental care, his housing, his food and various luxury items. Except there won't be just one single immigrant. The leader of the Centre party, Annie Lööf dreams of a Sweden with 40 million inhabitatants. 30 million of which would be immigrants.

Free immigration also brings old people. People who in an economic sense will be a complete drain on society.
If you're an elderly immigrant in Sweden, the taxpayers will pay your pension. It matters not that you haven't worked a single hour in Sweden.

You either dismantle the welfare state, which I'm sure would make many an American thrilled, or you clamp down on immigration. Maybe put some checks into place, only import people you desperately NEED.
I'll never understand Sweden's obsession with Africans and Arabs. Importing highly educated Asians or Europeans would be far better from an economic standpoint but I suppose that they're simply not attractive enough.

true,parigot,null,null,"My first piece of advice is take longer than a week if you're planning to go to three countries. Flying west &gt; east is exhausting and you will take a while to get over the jet lag. You won't get to know a place if you spend only a day there, since half the day is taken up with traveling/getting settled in your hotel/getting back &amp; forth from the station/eating, etc.. If you can't take more than a week, just go to Paris and London, or Paris and Berlin, or Paris and Munich. You'll be happier and have a better experience. 

In my experience long-distance travel in Europe is almost always cheaper by plane than by train. I don't know why the trains are so expensive but they are (unless you fit into one of the categories that gets lower fares, but then you can often get lower fares on air tickets too). 

Hotel-- just stay in a good location, in a place recommended by TripAdvisor travelers. Location location location! Hostels will allow you to meet other travelers. There are some nice ones in Paris; try searching in this subreddit.

Car-- It's not that hard driving in Europe. Remember that almost all rental cars are stick-shift and if you want an automatic you'll have to specify that. They often bump you up to the most expensive category for automatic cars, which is annoying.

You don't need a car for any major European city, but if you want to get out of the city, a car is the way to go. It's easy driving, with good signposting. On a two-lane highway in most of Europe, the right lane is for trucks, the left lane is for high-speed tailgaters... don't get mad, that's just how it is.

In France the main thing to remember is that priority is always to the right. This is taken to an extreme and can be very dangerous for foreigners. For example, it means that traffic entering an highway or a roundabout has priority over the traffic in the road, *unless* there is a stop sign or stop light. Even a tiny road on the right that you can barely see has priority over a major highway. This causes a lot of accidents from foreigners who assume the righthand driver will give way.

I'm gonna plug Haven in Paris (http://www.haveninparis.com/apartments/paris/) We stayed in their Sacre Coeur Penthouse studio and it was adorable, super-clean, great location and awesome views. In 2012 we rented through Perfectly Paris (http://www.perfectlyparis.com/) and stayed in the ""Elegance at Lamarck"" apartment, which is gorgeous, another great location directly across the street from the Metro entrance so being out in the 18th and away from the center of town is no problem...20 minutes or less on the Metro to get into the center of Paris. Montmartre is a great area though, albeit touristy. But I found the Lamarck area, on the backside of the hill to be less touristy and more ""neighbourhoody"", if that makes sense LOL

Of course, people who actually live there probably have better info, but sometimes inhabitants have a different point of view than a tourist. So there are all kinds of things to consider.

By the very nature of links, it's not necessarily apparent which of the two things you're doing, but knowing what of the two you're doing is necessary when you have a case about, say, libel, including fair competition laws and so on.

So nowadays there's disclaimers all over the place to circumvent the default assumption, which might not make much sense but isn't law, either, it's just what some courts tend to do (there's no (binding) precedent in Germany). It won't actually help you if that disclaimer is judged to be there only to cover your tracks, though.

I said ""some"" courts, and with that I mean mostly the Hamburg Landgericht, Germany still has the *actually* insane law that as things published over the internet can be accessed anywhere in Germany, you can file your case anywhere. That usually means the notorious Hamburg Landgericht, because that's where the internet print-outers are.

This volatile jurisdiction is the *actual* problem, because it circumvents the randomisation of courts dealing with cases, and those monopolising of opinion and legal practice. Fix that and the Hamburg Landgericht won't monopolise those cases any more, and things will look better.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;d. But let's be clear, EU, not France alone, had to put a rule in place, and they find that the number of Ha dedicated for cows was a good indicator. 

Yes of course the number of Ha is important, I can see that. However, the money is not calculated (only) on the number of Ha. It is calculated on the number of trees on the Ha. So, in essence what the EU is saying is that the cow who grows up like [this Greek cow](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/thumblarge_185/1189983679PKzd1J.jpg) is better (since the farmer gets more money) than a cow who grows up like [this](http://www.rattvik.se/Temp/e539835dcb9306eb519dc00d2a146a26.jpg). There is no scientific base for that, of course. 

I can even understand why that rule came into place. They for some reason wanted to separate pastures from crop land, and then they divided it up by trees/ha. Being just six countries, who all were pretty equal in that department, it made sense. 

What I can't understand however, is the refusal to remove it. Sweden for example has been trying to get it removed since 1995, it is going 18 years now.....


Having arbitrary rules, that does not affect the outcome, and that the country can't really change (we can not cut down all of our trees really......)is discrimination, unfortunately, and I can't see how the EU can defend it. 
I mean, it is one stupid rule and if that was the only problem hurrah, but there are a lot of rules like that. 

And no, of course not it is not just France, however, the French are the formidable defender of the CAP. I mean, Greece gets a lot more money, but they are hardly (a bit sad perhaps) in a position to defend it. The Netherlands are open to re-negotiations etc. So, the biggest defender of the CAP, with the most influence, seems to be France. Also, the Brits, who hardly benefits from it, wants to change it, which of course doesn't work well in the current EU climate.

&gt;could you explain please with actual facts ? honest question. and your solutions maybe.

Well, for one, I'd start with the example I gave you. I do not think it is fair that a French/Greek (and other countries)  farmer gets more for raising cows in the exact same way, based solely on the number of trees. I think it should be scientifically calculated, the quality of life for the cow, what it gets to eat, how much time it spend outside, size, and perhaps for good measure, extra for the little farmer (I am sure there are more things to consider). The number of tree/ha does not affect that cows quality of life.


Some other reasons (they are to many to list really):


The current CAP also supports the growing of wine (10 % of the CAP, which makes for around 4 % of the EU's budget in total). Is that reasonable, do you think? We can't even grow that stuff, and personally, I'd much rather have that money invested in environmental issues. Why does people growing wine need support, it is hardly an essential thing we need for survival? 

Another thing, is that the CAP support a two pillar system, one pillar is direct payment/price support and the other pillar is rural development. [Link to BBC article that explains a bit of it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11216061). The UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, etc wants to focus more on the rural development. France have always been against that. Sweden need the rural development, we are the size of Spain, and 9 million people, and it is hard farming up here - we need the support. However, for countries like France it makes no sense, since you have a lot of agricultural land and don't need support to farm it, or the problem we have, if you just leave it and it get taken over by forests (true problem in Sweden....). So, of course there is less focusing on rural development. 

However, the focus on pillar one, is in my, and a lot of northern/Eastern europeans a really bad thing. It keeps the prices higher, but it doesn't help those who need it. Oh, and of course the whole of Eastern Europe would benefit from a switch in focus from pillar one to pillar two, they would get more money, and France/Belgium/Spain would get less.  That means that more than half of the EU, size wise, and country wise, think is a good idea to focus more on pillar two. We think that is more beneficial for the EU, as a whole, and for us. However, that is not happening because of recistance, from among other countries -France/Spain/Italy. Of course France is entitled to their opinion, but when they claim it is for the benefit of the EU, it makes me irritated. It benefits them, not the EU as a whole. 

I might also add that I am in favour of *only* giving pillar two support to really poor countries, excluding Sweden et al, if that means that we truly would pay a lot less to the EU and had the freedom to help the rural areas ourselves. 


&gt;I'm not a big fan of CAP but i'm just tired of scandinavians people of reddit bashing on EU

Brits too :-)
[Here](http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Content/Documents/Pdfs/CAP_2012.pdf)is a British report (I go for the British criticism, since it is in English). You do not have to read the whole thing, of course, but page 13-18 have some valid criticism, and some interesting graphs, as to why they (and Sweden) are against the CAP. They quote sources too. Perhaps that can give you an insight to why people do not like the it, and want it to end.

&gt;It's oil, it's contribution, it's CAP, there is always something, and i'm under the feeling that they want to leave EU.

I don't know about oil, but you are right, I am very disappointed in the EU in general. I certainly do not feel that my money is being well spent, and the CAP is a huge factor in that. Furthermore, I think the EU is behving more and more non - democratic, and I find that alarming. 

I'd like for you to tell me why the CAP is good, and why we need to keep it in its current form?

Sorry about that, but I am really, really frustrated about the CAP, particularely since it is the biggest part of the budget. 

&gt; Because, I worked in rural France for 3 years, and here too, EU seems to be the root of all their problems. I mean it seems that we did sacrifices too, not enough maybe, but we did some.

My solution for that is easy- remove the CAP from the budget. Then we can all support/or not support our farmers to our hearts content, and we will stop arguing/hating each other over it too. I would love for that to happen actually, perhaps it would be good for you to. However, I suspect that Greece, Spain etc wouldn't love it.

But ok, let's talk about nuclear power. Have you been following the news in regards to this topic in the last 20 years? And the huge clusterfuck that is final storage here in Germany? I'm sure you'd agree that Gorleben and Asse aren't exactly good arguments for a solution. It might also be interesting to have a closer look at how expensive nuclear energy really is. Especially when you consider final storage for about 1000 years and that nuclear power plants are exempt from insurance.
As for safety in general. No system is perfectly safe. And that risk only gets bigger with political or monetary interests. Like for example building Fukushima in a dangerous area, because it is politically opportune.
Last but not least, consider the age of the German reactors. All the talk about modern plants being safe is fine. But the German plants are not new in any sense of the word.

So no, I don't think nuclear power is viable at the moment for the above reasons. Especially when regenerative energy could easily replace all nuclear power-plants in Germany. For that, we'd need the current government to stop blocking progress in this area though. But I guess the contributions from the energy companies are just too high at the moment.

As for the ""Go on"" part. I don't really understand why you rant against the only party that so far hasn't helped in dismantling the safety net you are talking about. SPD and Grüne are responsible for Hartz 4. CDU and FDP made things even worse. These four parties are directly responsible for the huge growth in the low wages sectors. They are responsible for the ever growing number of employees who can't live of their salary, even though they work full-time. All four are responsible for the modern slavery that goes on in the ""Zeitarbeit"" industry. Where people are forced to work for sub-par pay. Replacing fully paid positions with the crappy subsidized ones.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Big-scale farmers have national importance, if they stop farming, then food will have to be imported from abroad and that will cost much more.

Nonsense, you seem to imply that without subsidies, people would stop producing food, which is just beyond ridiculous.

As for food imports, we ought to lower the tariffs altogether and allow for cheaper foreign foods to be more accessible to us all, there's plenty of other countries in the world which would gladly sell us their excess food and we'd all be willing to buy them if we didn't discriminate against them with the protectionist measures we've instituted.

&gt;If we don't subsidize them, they will go and work something else, which in turn means that there won't be anyone left to grow the food. 

That is just stupid, there have always been plenty of farmers before and after the subsidies.

What, should we also subsidy cellphone companies, clothing industries and car manufactures or else nobody will make cellphones, clothes and cars?

You really don't have an idea of how a market works so let me explain it to you - if there are people willing to buy something, there will be an incentive for people to provide that something. As long as people are willing to buy food, there will be people interested in supplying it.

&gt;You think those farmer strikes happen every couple weeks just for fun? Or maybe they're striking because they have too much money?

They happen because they're a special interest group that (like every special interest group) wants special benefits at the expense of everybody else.

If you watched my previous video, please [watch this one as well from the same session](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_T0WF-uCWg), it's highly relevant to that matter of special groups (he even mentions farmers) trying to lobby the government for benefits.

&gt;Look up how much they earn. This autumn the farmers were getting around 14 euro cents per kilo of potatoes. How much do they cost in a supermarket? Around 1 euro/kg? Now think who's the bad guy here and who's getting too much money.

There are people who earn much less and get none of that.

And, [like u/WobbleWagon mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/17yc4j/cap_subsidies_to_farmers_per_hectare_for_2013/c8abish), don't assume for a second that the money is going all to the little man who is in need and requires our support, that's not and is never the case.

To think that you'll solve any of these problems by making the rest of society the ones paying for it, that's just not right, it never works as intended and the best system to determine what should and shouldn't be done is a free market system, not a government taking money from all of us to give to the farmers or farming corporations who lobby the best regardless of their final product.",0,1360175095,null,0,false,0,c8agen5,t3_17yc4j,t1_c8agen5,t1_c8acjn0,null,1431210808,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Yea, like Poland with their disease-ridden cows, rat poison-filled candy and beef burgers which are actually made from horses.

&gt; if we didn't discriminate against them with the protectionist measures

Protectionist measures are not for fun either, we need to secure our own businesses first, before giving away all the money to someone else. It's better for everyone (except Poland) if the money stays in the country.

&gt;What, should we also subsidy cellphone companies, clothing industries and car manufactures

No, those industries are already profitable. Farmers, on the other hand, would simply go bankrupt without subsidies.

&gt;if there are people willing to buy something, there will be an incentive for people to provide that something.

Oh, if only it was that simple... You seem to like US, so let's look at american health care. Free market, right? Yet a simple broken hand can cost as much as $2000. If there's a demand for cheaper services, then why is there no supply?

&gt;As long as people are willing to buy food, there will be people interested in supplying it.

You see, the problem is that people ARE interested in supplying it, but they can't. With the current prices (14 cent/kg) it's almost not profitable to make food. Without subsidies it would be downright stupid to try and grow potatoes. 

&gt;[The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_T0WF-uCWg)

Relevance to the discussion - 0%. Lobbying is illegal here, in case you didn't know. Even if it was, I still don't see how would it be relevant, the video is about big businesses (like oil industry), not the small guy (the farmer driving a tractor). There is no power when you're a farmer, dude's crazy.

&gt;And, [like u/WobbleWagon mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/17yc4j/cap_subsidies_to_farmers_per_hectare_for_2013/c8abish), don't assume for a second that the money is going all to the little man who is in need and requires our support.

Wait, I thought this thread was about reducing subsidies to farmers, not to large corporations?

&gt; the best system to determine what should and shouldn't be done is a free market system

I strongly disagree. A completely free-market system with no government intervention would lead to horrible quality, sky-high prices and lots of cartel deals. Those are businesses. They're not thinking about their customers and how to make them nice and comfy. They're thinking about profits. If everyone reduces their quality by an equal amount, what are you going to do?

Nor do I particlularely like the way we treat 3rd world countries, who would need to export to us, to make more money.

I would, btw, like for you to link to me why scientifically, cows are better off in France, Greece etc, than in Sweden. I know that in the CAP scale of things, it is a small issue, but it is symptomatic how the EU decide stuff. No science, no cost, no poverty based- the rule is just arbitrary,- yet it is being kept, and you and a lot of other countries are even saying that the rule is right, correct, and should be there.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Yea, like Poland with their disease-ridden cows, rat poison-filled candy and beef burgers which are actually made from horses.

Poland is within the EU and receives money from CAP.

&gt;Protectionist measures are not for fun either, we need to secure our own businesses first, before giving away all the money to someone else. It's better for everyone (except Poland) if the money stays in the country.

What are you going on about Poland? And no, we don't need to secure our businesses first, we need to secure the best living standard for our people and that is done with complete free trade.

&gt;No, those industries are already profitable. Farmers, on the other hand, would simply go bankrupt without subsidies.

How do you explain the big farming corporations then? Are they not profitable?

&gt;Oh, if only it was that simple... You seem to like US, so let's look at american health care. Free market, right? Yet a simple broken hand can cost as much as $2000. If there's a demand for cheaper services, then why is there no supply?

The US healthcare is a strawman and not a free market. What are you trying to imply, that consumers don't want cheaper products and will act irrationally?

&gt;You see, the problem is that people ARE interested in supplying it, but they can't. With the current prices (14 cent/kg) it's almost not profitable to make food. Without subsidies it would be downright stupid to try and grow potatoes. 

Nonsense, that's not for you to decide, food production came ages before government subsidies, it comes from time immemorial, that we'd run out of food if not for the government subsidies is outright wrong, as demonstrated by every single piece of evidence.

&gt;Lobbying is illegal here, in case you didn't know.

[It isn't](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying#European_Union).

&gt;Even if it was, I still don't see how would it be relevant, the video is about big businesses (like oil industry), not the small guy (the farmer driving a tractor).

You must have watched a different video then, he clearly talks about special interest such as big business (like the oil industry), small business (like the farmer) and other groups like labour unions.

&gt;There is no power when you're a farmer, dude's crazy.

There isn't? Are you insane? Then what about their protests? If they were powerless, why do all politicians cave in to their demands?

&gt;Wait, I thought this thread was about reducing subsidies to farmers, not to large corporations?

It's about reducing all subsidies, as if they're there, they're inevitably end up going for the wrong people (this not to mention how highly inefficient they are - putting all taxpayers pay for the uncompetitiveness of some farmers).

&gt;A completely free-market system with no government intervention would lead to horrible quality, sky-high prices and lots of cartel deals.

Those things you just mentioned only occur in markets closed to competition and that are heavily influenced by the government.

&gt;They're not thinking about their customers and how to make them nice and comfy. They're thinking about profits.

So who's going to think about how nice and comfy you are? The legislator, the politician and the bureaucrat? They're even worse!

At least when the businessman wants profits, they'll do their best to provide a good service and therefore benefit the rest of society, as Adam Smith said it, ""It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we can expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest"".

&gt;If everyone reduces their quality by an equal amount, what are you going to do? 

That never happens, tell me a business competing in a free market system that manages to succeed by lowering their quality. The second you start selling crap products or offering a shitty service, your customers will go elsewhere, bam, you're out of business for acting against the interests of your customers.

true,altierospinelli,null,null,"Impiegato_statale , la mia opinione penso sia esplicitata fin troppo a lungo nell'articolo stesso. Sicuramente però posso aggiungere che concordo con coloro che scrivono che la laurea non debba costituire un titolo di privilegio, se non quello di riconoscere che qualcuno ha studiato certe materie utili per ricoprire certe professioni. 

Penso che le mansioni del direttore di un supermercato grosso come un Esselunga, ""tanto grosso da generare singolarmente un bilancio simile a quello di una media impresa italiana "" (*citazione slide esselunga*), sia quello di avere la responsabilità delle operazioni, garantire l'implementazione della politica commerciale del gruppo,  gestire le risorse umane e turni insieme a tutti gli imprevisti e problematiche che a livello inferiore non possono esser risolte. Ingenuamente, pensavo che un computer sicuramente fosse uno strumento utile per un direttore, se non altro per comunicare con la sede centrale in maniera continua (così invece non sembra essere).

Io lamento soltanto il fatto che l'annuncio è veramente fuorviante,  e che a lungo andare non è sostenibile. Trovo deleterio che si precluda una carriera in Esselunga a chi non ha la laurea, e invece si raccontino frottole per assumere persone che sono in cerca di tutt'altro mestiere, poi magari finiranno ad affettare prosciutti all'Esselunga nella vita, perchè capre-laureate, però almeno saranno consapevoli di rispondere per un annuncio che cerca figure da mettere all'affettatrice. Solo questo dicevo. 

Ribadisco: L'annuncio non è trasparente, anzi è un inganno bello e buono, non ti preparano per diventare Direttore semplicemente ti inseriscono e poi come in qualunque altro posto di lavoro puoi fare la tua carriera.  Però se vengo assunto come impiegato nell'azienda X , è ovvio che con gli anni e se dimostro eccezionali qualità magari un giorno divento l'amministratore delegato.. però sicuramente nell'annuncio per l'impiegato non ci scrivono ""allievo amministratore delegato"" .

And how are you going to do that if all the farmers in your country will be left without jobs as all shopping centres will be importing food from abroad? That doesn't sound like the best option for our people.

&gt;How do you explain the big farming corporations then? Are they not profitable?

As I've already said, I'm not talking about big corporations. I'm talking about smaller farmers, family farms and all that.

&gt;The US healthcare is a strawman and not a free market.

OK then, let's take US mobile phone market. They pay a shitload of money, yet it's supposedly a free market that anyone can enter, right?

Not so long ago prices for international calls in EU were insane. Thankfully, the governments stepped in and put caps on those prices. How is that bad?

&gt;Then what about their protests? If they were powerless, why do all politicians cave in to their demands?

They protest because that's the only way for them to be heard. They can't go with lobbying as they can't afford any of that. They have zero say in all those legislations and in politics. They block the roads because then the news cover them and they get some exposure.

&gt;It's about reducing all subsidies, as if they're there, they're inevitably end up going for the wrong people

So should we stop ALL government payouts? All benefits for the jobless, all funding for school programs, road constructions, everything? There always is some amount of money that goes to the wrong hands. But the solution is NOT to cut everything completely, it's to cut it to those wrong hands.

&gt;At least when the businessman wants profits, they'll do their best to provide a good service and therefore benefit the rest of society

...what? No, there are two ways to increase profits: you either increase quality (costs rise too) or reduce costs (quality drops but sales rise). No businessman is working as a good samaritan whose only goal is to benefit the society. That's why they're called businessmen, they work for profit. If a cheap, shitty product makes more money, then that's what they will go with.

On the long run, that is the best option.

&gt;As I've already said, I'm not talking about big corporations. I'm talking about smaller farmers, family farms and all that.

These have always existed and will continue to exist.

&gt;OK then, let's take US mobile phone market. They pay a shitload of money, yet it's supposedly a free market that anyone can enter, right?

I don't know about it, if everybody is allowed to operate, then yes, it's a free market, only the most competitive businesses will thrive.

&gt;Not so long ago prices for international calls in EU were insane. Thankfully, the governments stepped in and put caps on those prices. How is that bad?

That in itself is not bad, what's bad was the cost of that. What do you think is paying for those more expensive calls now? Someone has to pay for those, if the market isn't allowed to operate freely and the companies are forced that extra expense then it has to be paid either by the shareholders who will have less capital to invest or by the worker will have a lower wage or by the consumer who will overall have to pay more for the service.

There ain't no such thing as a free lunch, for some people to benefit, others have to bear the cost - in that case, it's clear that people who make international calls benefited and the cost of that is now supported by everyone and is therefore diffused, but don't you ever think this was an improvement made at nobody's expense, that with the government regulation, there was an increase in the overall living standard.

&gt;They protest because that's the only way for them to be heard. They can't go with lobbying as they can't afford any of that. They have zero say in all those legislations and in politics. They block the roads because then the news cover them and they get some exposure.

You're right, they're lobbying, just like every other special interest group. Their influence separately might be insignificant but when they organise like that it most certainly isn't, they swing the opinion of a lot of people and politicians who then act in their benefit and at the expense of everybody else.

&gt;So should we stop ALL government payouts? All benefits for the jobless, all funding for school programs, road constructions, everything?

It can't be done like that, all changes must be done incrementally and not in one go. And I'm only talking about agricultural subsidies - welfare, education and public constructions are an wholly different subject.

&gt;...what? No, there are two ways to increase profits: you either increase quality (costs rise too) or reduce costs (quality drops but sales rise).

You really need to at least learn the basics of Adam Smith :s

&gt;No businessman is working as a good samaritan whose only goal is to benefit the society.

And who are these angels and good samaritans who will organise society for us?

&gt;That's why they're called businessmen, they work for profit. If a cheap, shitty product makes more money, then that's what they will go with.

Not only the ICANN operates DNS roots. It operates a sizeable number, but hasn't a monopoly on them. From a technical and practical POV, it's anything but irreplaceable.

The actual power it has, right now, is controlling which TLDs there are, and what NIC to assign to each. Should the US try to, say, stop the ICANN to list .ir (Iran), it will soon realise that all the other DNS roots won't follow suit, and start to organise an ICANN replacement.

The ICANN will then end up being degraded to approximately the same status RIPE has now (modulo disgrace), and the US are of course perfectly allowed to discriminate against Iran *on their own soil*, so it still has a job, as someone has to operate a handful of DNS roots without the .ir domain that US ISPs can use for their DNS servers. 

...but don't think the rest of the internet will care.

And setting up more roots if you already operate some isn't *that* hard. Challenges vary from none (clone a couple machines at current locations) to limited (Ensure physical and network security at new locations).

Furthermore, with the introduction of DNSSEC, the fact that ICANN *is* the logical DNS root is further solidified by the fact, that only they have the root DNSKEY that everyone trusts.

Translation: France still wants their *massive* Farming subsidies. They can cut small things as long as it doesn't hurt France.

PPPoE on DSL lines is a stupid idea by German ISPs to make your Internet bill look more like your phone bill. It serves no real technical purpose, hence why it's actually not widely used in a global context. Besides, not every machine that requires a secure DNS is connected to a DSL line even in Germany. In fact, the majority probably aren't.

If you trust SSHFP resource records and are using a stub resolver, then I guess you deserve to be owned. The fact is, there are many attack vectors there, starting with your Wireless connection at Starbucks. And remember, we're talking about a protocol that doesn't make use of flow control, you don't even have to MITM to spoof it.

&gt;But then... say we really deploy DNSSEC. Then using a stub vs. a ""proper"" resolver will be the answer to the question: ""Whom do I trust more, ICANN or my ISP?

true,I-am_Batman,BELG,Belgium,"&gt;I find it difficult to find a job because I'm not Swedish not because I don't have the qualifications. I mean sure, you can never be sure of this, but when applying to a job that asks EXACTLY your qualifications and you fulfill every one of them, and you don't even get called for an interview then something is fishy. I have applied to over 500 jobs in the past two years. Almost every other day. All of them were directly relevant and I fulfilled the requirements almost 90% sometimes (more than you would think) I was spot on. I haven't even been called in for an interview. Not even once. My area is marketing/media/business development so naturally I thought it would just be harder to find a job in this field but this is just ridiculous. At one point I was sick of it so I came up with a plan: **I changed my name with a fictional name, a Swedish one, and removed anything that would imply that I'm a foreigner. Any foreign qualifications, anything. I just came out as Swedish as possible. I also changed the C.V (look, wording, but kept the general qualifications) and then applied to 20 different jobs as two separate persons. One as me and one as the fictional Swede. 13 out of those 20 applications called me for an interview for the fictional Swede and I received ZERO invitations for an interview (some didn't even respond at all) as me.** So... at that point I just gave-up searching for a job. I realized it doesn't matter what qualifications I have, I don't have a Swedish name so I might as well give-up. The only thing I could think of was maybe the language? But then again, they didn't bother in asking me if I speak Swedish or how well do I speak Swedish. I've also tried applying to menial jobs and was refused there also. The only people who seem to get hired (as foreigners) are those for which companies are really really desperate for. So... I gave up. I started regretting that I came here because I actually wanted to just get a job, get a nice place... I learned Swedish rigorously and was waiting forward to just blend-in... but with no job that's out of the question. I'm now searching for jobs in other places, maybe the UK or Germany. In the end, it's a pity, because the fact is that the Swedish state invested some money in me (free college, literally free, because my parents didn't work here or paid taxes here, so I went to school on someone elses' expense) and it's now going to lose it because of no jobs. It's really bad, for me at least (some people do get jobs I guess... I don't know any, not yet... but I hear it happens) and to think about it, I would have prefered to pay for college but have a real chance of getting a job afterwards, instead of going to college for free and then being sent home because no jobs. I just didn't know this was the situation. Sweden is a great place but I really think it has a lot to learn from Germany and the UK in terms of employment and integrating foreigners. Whether the Swedes like it or not, the foreigners are here, the government is pushing for yet even more immigration, and it's not going to benefit anyone if they are being kept out of the workforce.

Considering money/saving: 

If you plan on staying more than a month, get an unlimited Under 25 Youth Travel Card (it includes the tram, underground and bus). It will save you tons of money and it's the easiest way to move around. 

Cheapest (and best supermarket) is Mercadona. There's one just outside the L4 stop at Girona. 

Trendiest place to eat/walk around is El Born (L4 Jaume I). Other great neighborhoods are el Raval and Gràcia, as well as el Gòtic. I'd highly recommend knowing them but not living there, as they're a bit dangerous at night (especially el Born i el Gòtic). Your best shots are living just outside the trendiest places or l'Eixample and then moving around the centre for the day and to shop and stuff. 

If you want to do the tourist stuff, don't pay for it. The only things really worth paying for are the MNAC (the museum of modern art) and the Gaudí houses if you're really into architecture. But there's free walking tours and you can get everywhere by underground and bus (never the tourist bus). 

Barcelona is a beautiful city. It's busy, it's fast, it's dirty at times and it's so rushed you feel like everything's on the clock. But at the same time, it's a wonderful place. It's a city where you can accidentally stumble upon the most precious little treasures (be it an old part of the city wall or a little shop with handmade stuff) and where you go from one world to another within minutes.

According to whom? You? Or some guy who's never even been to Europe and has no idea what EU is?

&gt;These have always existed and will continue to exist.

That's quite a strong statement. Mind you, I'm not talking about farms where a family grows just enough food to feed themselves. I'm talking about farms where they only grow one type of stuff and then sell it. If we cut the subsidies, then it won't be profitable anymore and they will stop selling stuff. ""In the long run"" doesn't really mean anything here, people won't just sit quietly without a job for a decade.

&gt;I don't know about it, if everybody is allowed to operate, then yes, it's a free market, only the most competitive businesses will thrive.

It is a free market and it's a horrible mess with insane prices and fees on everything. That's what happens when you let the businessmen do whatever they want. That's why it will never work. Someone has to control them.

&gt;What do you think is paying for those more expensive calls now? 

No one is paying for them. The prices were high because the companies were able to put whatever price they wanted. They could make it 1 euro/min and they did, even if the actual cost was one tenth of that. What are you going to do, sign a new mobile contract just for one week holiday abroad? That's why the governments had to step in and say ""Sorry guys, but these prices are unreasonable. Cut them.""

The opposite is going on in the agricultural world right now. The farmers are operating below the lowest limit. That's why they need subsidies. It simply wouldn't be profitable for them to keep operating without them. 

Now you may say ""Oh that's not a problem, someone else will come along."" Well sure, someone else will, and then you'll go back to paying 1 euro/min for your calls? I don't think it's a good solution.

&gt;And who are these angels and good samaritans who will organise society for us?

That's why we have democracies and why we elect people to do stuff and enforce rules, to make everyone equal. It may not be a perfect system and there are glitches every now and then, but it's much better than no government at all. Look at Somalia if you want to see how a country without a government looks.

I watched part of that video and I still don't see how any of it is relevant to all of this. Those are the very basic concepts of trade, the first baby steps. They ignore the enormous amount of change that the current market underwent. 

Look at it this way: you have a limited amount of money to spend every month, right? Now imagine if the prices of agricultural produce have doubled. Could you still feed yourself and your family? What about those who were living paycheck to paycheck before the increase?

You might say that the sellers will just import cheaper food from abroad, but then what will happen to your neighbour farmers? If what you say happens then there won't even be cheaper food from abroad, as almost all of it is from other EU countries. We don't import milk or meat from China for obvious reasons. Yes, it's cheaper than anywhere in EU, but the price is not the only thing that influences sales.",0,1360192448,null,0,false,0,c8amt2i,t3_17yc4j,t1_c8amt2i,t1_c8ak0e7,null,1431213938,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0
