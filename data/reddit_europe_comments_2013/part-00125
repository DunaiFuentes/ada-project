One of the many issues with this ""more power/more data"" approach lies with the fact that structure does not predict function. Knowing where cells are, or how they are clustered, or even the number of channels they have is insufficient in predicting how those cells fire in a network. This is also coupled with the fact that some things like learning (via synaptic weight change over time, etc.), neurogenesis, etc. are extremely important mechanisms to how particular neurons (and thus, particular networks) function, and these occur over much larger timescales than would be feasible to model in the machinery Katrin Amunts has proposed.

It's not a new thing in science for these large projects to get a lot of media attention only because of the scale of the resources involved. The human genome project, for instance, was extremely valuable in allowing medical researchers access to the locations of genes and thus allowed for further research into specific expression patterns of those genes. However, it never directly provided us with any information regarding how the expression of those genes.

It's a similar situation in protein folding research, as well. Knowing the chemical makeup of particular proteins is helpful, but ultimately it does not predict the folded structure of the protein even 50% of the time.

Ora sto cercando lavoro qui nello stesso settore (che in Italia non è quasi per nulla sviluppato) mentre finisco gli studi.

Non so la tua età e perché vorresti andare a vivere all'estero, ma una considerazione di carattere generale è ""**provaci, ma con la testa**"".

E' un modo un po' brutale per uscire dalla propria *comfort zone*, vedere cosa c'è oltre il quotidiano. L'ho trovato molto liberatorio, per un verso, perché permette di ricostruire da zero molte cose, dalle conoscenze allo stile di vita.
Può spaventare, soprattutto per l'incertezza economica diffusa (e a seconda di dove vorresti andare), per questo il mio invito è a non andare allo sbaraglio.

**Parla per te!** Conoscere l'Inglese aiuta moltissimo, in qualunque paese tranne la Francia ^^^scherzo! . Conoscere la lingua locale aiuta ancora di più.
Non sarai mai abbastanza pronto, quindi il consiglio è impara finché non sei in grado di chiedere le cose che non sai. Quando sai chiedere il significato di termini che non conosci, essere in un ambiente ricco di stimoli è come camminare in un libro di testo. Chiedi al commesso come si cucina la pastinaca (qui va tantissimo), chiedigli se intende pentola o padella, fritto o saltato. La lingua è il modo di interagire con l'ambiente, la paura di restare isolati viene così un po' esorcizzata.
In alternativa, cerca altri Italiani lì! Siamo molto cordiali quando viviamo all'estero (per turismo invece ho sempre conosciuto compatrioti un po' scontrosi), ci piace sottilmente criticare tutto ciò che scimmiotta il Bel Paese (*Pasta Schuta anyone?*)e rivelare modi per ricreare le nostre quotidianità.

**Piano d'attacco!** in Internet c'è un mare di sapere. Scegli il paese in cui vorresti trasferirti imparando un po' sulle diverse realtà. Questo post è un buon punto d'inizio. Altrove c'è Italians In Fuga (una specie di blog-racconto di emigranti moderni nostrani) o tanti piccoli forum/siti specifici che possono darti un'idea di cosa aspettarti.

**Saggezza Orientale!** *Non andare per vincere, ma con l'idea di non perdere*. Uscire dai propri confini abituali, cambiare in piccolo o in grande la propria vita, è già un'esperienza che ti arricchirà tantissimo. Se poi dopo un po' di tempo decidi di tornare (o, purtroppo, sei costretto a farlo) avrai qualcosa di bello da raccontare e possibilmente anche da scrivere sul Curriculum (sono un po' fissato al momento, scusa). Anche scoprire che in America non è vero che non ci sono gatti è un gran passo avanti. Forse avrai capito cose di te che non conoscevi, di sicuro hai escluso qualcosa e puoi concentrarti su ciò che ti interessa!

Se vuoi andare a vivere all'estero è basilare imparare prima l'Inglese, poi la lingua del paese dove vuoi andare (se diverso dall'Inglese). Se hai disponibilità economica la cosa migliore è studiare lì e poi cercare lavoro in loco. Ciò detto molti si lanciano e partendo da lavoretti poi o vanno all'università o pian pianino trovano lavori migliori finché non riescono a raggiungere un livello di vita decente.

**Same as other posters, I do wonder how much strength the voice of the EU can gain.** Also, I'm not sure how much of this outrage is true. Parts *might* be a nice screen play for showing concerns while establishing the same infrastructure as the US friends. I mean, it's the EU who is trying to push the *data preservation* into the (still) critical countries. Leverage.

Adding to all the 'we didn't know the US is doing it' expressions, it might be worth the wait to find out if some countries actually knew about what and how much the NSA is collecting. Thinking a bit further, it's a nice way of circumventing national privacy laws since the data wasn't collected by local authorities but a friend in the war against terror, right?

To be honest, this last point would be the most interesting for me. Wanting to know how deep the rabbit hole goes, so to speak.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt; Giving up that technology and investment would cost the UK dearly and be very short sighted

I disagree. The investment would not be lost, it would be diverted to other areas. The argument about jobs and the economy is kind of null, because any kind of government spending creates jobs and goes back into the economy. Who's economy it goes into, is a different question. If money was diverted to the ESA, then money would be going to the European economy, which is something I am fully ok with.

Secondly, the nuclear technology might be lost, but I don't even think that's a worth while argument. We might need it one day, but we have plenty of nuclear weapons wielding allies like the USA and France. Heck, the USA still has nuclear weapons on our soil. Secondly, if there's actually no other benefit to keeping the technology around and if we assume that if stopping program would mean the loss of such nuclear technology (two big ifs) then why should we waist the money on keeping an industry alive if it's literally no use to us and will only potentially be of use to us many decades down the road?

Additionally, we *might* lose the nuclear technology (we might not because the companies have other people to sell to) it would be replaced by the advancements which could be made in the space industry, which would support more jobs and also support a growing industry (space industry).

So yes, t's more complicated than ""that"" but it's also not as complicated than you're making it out. There are more issues than simply spending money on Trident or spending it on something else, but there's not much beyond that and there's also very good counter arguments to the pro Trident arguments.

Les opposants de la Manif pour tous font entendre leur opposition au mariage homosexuel et à la PMA: il s'agit bel et bien d'une contribution au débat. 

A t'entendre, on a l'impression qu'un ""vrai débat"" est un débat à sens unique, sans arguments contradictoires. Et dire que les participants à la Manif pour tous s'opposent par pure ""réaction"", c'est un peu court.

Je rappelle au passage que le concept de ""réaction"" est extrêmement subjectif: on est tous le réactionnaire de quelqu'un. A ce compte-là, je te prends les alter-mondialistes qui défilent dans la rue et je leur colle l'étiquette de ""réactionnaires"" parce qu'ils s'opposent au ""sens de l'histoire"", à savoir la mondialisation. 

Le réactionnaire est à contre-courant, c'est l'une de ses principales caractéristiques. Il a des idées qui méritent d'être examinées; ce n'est pas parce qu'elles ne correspondent pas à la *doxa* du moment qu'elles sont forcément mauvaises.

&gt;La manif pour tous de manière générale ne cherche pas le débat, elle cherche l'interdiction pure et simple par réaction.

Encore une phrase que je ne comprends pas. Les participants à la Manif pour tous font entendre leurs idées; ils cherchent à éviter la légalisation du mariage homosexuel (raté) et à conserver l'interdiction de la PMA (ça reste à voir). Mais ils ne cherchent pas à ""interdire le débat"". 

Au risque de me répéter, dissocier mariage homosexuel et PMA pour les homosexuels est intellectuellement malhonnête. Je pense avoir déjà suffisamment expliqué en quoi la légalisation de la PMA ne relevait pas du fantasme mais d'une conclusion logique pour qui contemple le monde de façon lucide.

&gt;""Victoire amère, il manque la PMA"", affichaient les militants du collectif Oui Oui Oui, le soir du vote du mariage pour tous. A la tribune, place Baudoyer, dans le 4e arrondissement de Paris, les élus qui ont défendu la réforme se sont succédé et l'ont affirmé : le combat continue pour l'accès des couples de lesbiennes à la procréation médicalement assistée. Mais du côté du gouvernement, l'heure est à l'apaisement et la loi a peu de chances de voir le jour avant la fin du mandat socialiste.

I will. I don't think you realize just how priviledged you are when compared to the rest of the world. 

&gt;I simply feel certain that I'd rather stay than flee.

What you think you'll do and what you'll actually do are two different things altogether. Until you experience actual conflict you have no right to judge others for fleeing. 

&gt;I do consider myself somewhat of a nationalist/patriot, which I would say explains why I don't hold in high regard the idea of fleeing one's country for selfish reasons.

So, things to do for fun, in Bilbao:


- The beach! The closest one would be in Las Arenas/Areeta (get excited about everything have both a spanish and basque name)  but the best ones are Sopelana (the right beach is clothed, left is nude), confusingly located at the metro stop before Sopelana, and Plentzia. To get to all of those you just hop off the metro at those stops and wander around lost for about five minutes before you bump into the ocean.

- Hiking. Bilbao is nestled in the mountains and there are a million trails nearby. My favorite was the one in Plentzia. If you walk down to the shore, which is a beautiful half moon of a beach, on the far side there's an almost hidden hiking trail going up and down the mountains along the coast up to a lighthouse a couple huge hills over. There's also Gorbeia (spelled something roughly like that) that's a huge park nearby, but I never made it.

- Nightlife: The biggest club is Fever, kind of far away on the metro, but it has a bit of a reputation for being a bit of a highschool age hangout. I can't really tell you too much about it because every time I went my friends got so drunk I had to leave pretty much immediately. A nice thing about Fever is that it's theoretically free for the first 1000 people admitted/before 2 am. A couple other names: Mau Mau Beach, Distrito 9 (where all the Erasmus parties were last semester), Backstage, New Bilbao. Drinking in not-clubs is also great. Get excited about botellons - drinking from the bottle in the street. There are some places in Casco Viejo where every weekend night the streets are completely packed from people partying there and the bars are kind of empty. Some good places for bars: Indautxu has a ton of great cheap ones like Grafit, Calle Pozas has a billion bars including the chain La Surena which is great for super cheap pre gaming and watching the Athletic games, and Casco Viejo has a ton of little pinxo bars.

- Funicular: go up the funicular! The view from up there is pretty fantastic, you can get there from crossing the white bridge (aka Zubizuri) walking away from Plaza Moyua, then going straight about two blocks, left one-ish, and then at the very end of a little plaza is the funicular. You can use your metro card to go up there, there's not too much at the top, just a nice park, roller skating space, and a few restaurants.

- travel to nearby cities: Bilbao is close to so many amazing places. San Sebastian, Santander, Pamplona, Logrono, Burgos, lots of amazing French cities (Biarritz, Bayona, San Juan de Luz)

- go to San Juan de Gaztelugatxe (just google it)

- go the the Alhondiga at least once, it's an amazingly designed library/gym/pool/movie theater/art gallery. Its really easy to get a library card if you want one and they have a fantastic selection.

(I don't know if any of this is what you actually want to know, but I just left and I miss it so I'm rambling)

As far as if you should travel around spain, I enthusiastically recommend it. I was really lucky to get to go to pretty much all the major cities and I don't regret any of the money or time I spent on that traveling. My favorites are Sevilla and Barcelona, but I also recommend Granada, Zaragoza, Valencia, Madrid (just briefly, though) and definitely Toledo. The country is very varied and all of the cities have very distinct personalities. 

Things to be prepared for... very different hours for mealtimes. Expect lunch after 2 and dinner around 10.

Also, the weather is absolute shit. (Sorry.) You'll be getting there while it's beautiful and then by the end it'll be the absolute hell I showed up to. I'm being a little dramatic because I'm a little tipsy and I'm also texan, but seriously, it rained at least 95% of the first three months I was there and it was cold. So bring very good warm clothes and rain boots or plan on spending money on those things when you get there. Invest in a sturdy umbrella. The wind is a bitch. It's still an incredible, fantastic place, but the weather is pretty horrid.

Who are you studying with there/at what school? 

Oh, I don't know how your housing works, but do everything you can to get a homestay/apartment actually in the city! Having to take the metro in from Getxo is a total pain, especially because the biggest parties (Erasmus) are always thursday nights and the metro stops at 11, which means lots of expensive taxi rides/staying home because you can't afford it.

Send me a message/reply/whatever if you have any other questions!

You are correct that Erdogan's (at least public) willingness to go with EU-US policy in the middle east is a major reason Washington and Brussels don't put more diplomatic pressure on him, but there is no over-arching nefarious plot to misrepresent what an ass the guy often is. There may be smaller nefarious plots; I haven't researched it, but Erdogan seems like the type with a lot of media contacts.

Basically, I am saying that corporate media needs to make a profit, so they are biased towards laziness and their readers comfort zones.

Surely my lengthy response which touches on a variety of relevant issues with relevant information and conclusions is some what of a validation of my understanding of the subject material? So I would kindly ask that you respect my intelligence on the subject, or at the very least, give me the benefit of the doubt that I'm not an idiot. You'll find yourself a lot more willing to change your point of view if you don't immediately consider any one who disagrees with you an idiot or a fool.

Anyway, I think you're over stating the value of the Trident program and of having the ""best submarines in the world"". Furthermore, what's the benefit of having the best submarine industry in the world? I'm sure there is a lot of gross domestic product and revenue which comes from the British submarine industry, but I think there are more important things and I also don't think the revenue/jobs/ect are that fantastic that we should go on spending the 2 billion which could be converted to other courses. If you have some interesting economic evidence which contradicts me, I would find that greatly interesting and I hope that you link it to me. 

Secondly on the economic benefits of the submarine industry. I've said before, just because we stop funding Trident does not mean the UK sub industry will disappear. It might not be the best in the world (if it is currently), though I'm not sure it'll necessarily get worse, but let's assume it will. The UK sub industry will continue and if it gets smaller it'll still rake in huge amounts of jobs and revenue. Though there will be an obvious loss, as there is with any loss of government funding.

Thirdly, I believe that the lost in government funding to the sub industry will be recooped by a growth in the space industry. The space industry already makes up 6 billion pounds in the British economy and could easily grow much much larger both as a percent of economic activity and as in terms of the size of the number in pound sterling. Furthermore, the space industry is only going to get more and more important as companies like Virgin Galactic and that venture by Google founder Larry Page to mine space rocks (I forget the name of the venture), among many others. The space industry will only get bigger and more important where as subs wont necessarily. With things like the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, there's certainly going to be no new nuclear subs getting built. 

So that's my argument. I hope you find it well thought and certainly not retarded.

Pricing differences in the standard fair should really not depend on the time of day. Only on the type of train used and the resulting duration of the journey (quicker = more expensive). Thats why you might find a cheaper standard faire in the middle of the night. Its probably not using high speed trains but instead some combination of local trains. That would make it cheaper, and you can look for a similiar connection during the daytime by limiting the modes of transport in your search.
Either try ""All without ICE"" or ""only local transport"".
Heidelberg to Strassbourg is not that long a journey. The regio-train only connection takes only about 40 minutes longer than the one with high speed trains.

If you go only by local train you can also use a ""Baden-Würthenberg Ticket"". This entitles a group of people to use all regional trains within Baden Würthenberg for one day. It will come out much cheaper than regular tickets if you a.) go back on the same day and / or b.) go with multiple people.
Now this ticket isn't actually valid till Straßburg but only till ""Kehl"" which is the german city just over the river from straßburg. From there you could either buy another ticket, don't buy another ticket or walk.

Its really not that far and its a nice walk over a nice fancy bridge. I've actually done that to save money on the ticket before.

Edit: so [according to google maps](http://goo.gl/maps/iijkG) its about a one hour walk to the center of Straßburg. Thats a little longer than i remember. So consider that.

In many post-communist countries (I'm not saying ""post-Soviet"" as I'm not sure if Romania was officially part of the Soviet bloc, hence them having diplomatic relationships with western powers during the Ceausescu regime) is that the many of the same people who were influential Party officials in the 80s still have both political power and financial power today: they still run the their respective countries and were the only ones who had the finances to buy state assets like mines and factories when they were dirt cheap. 

So (I'm guessing) that in the case of Romania and countries with similar problems, if you're selling a state-owned freight railroad company to avoid corruption problems, it may not work. For one thing, you're moving this asset from one set of corrupt hands to another, plus that second set of hands *probably* has government connections and is contributing to ongoing corruption.

When Microsoft announces a bugfix to the public, the bad guys are essentially handed leads on where to look when trying to break into unpatched systems. That's why Microsoft patches are released on a [tight, predictable schedule,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday) so companies are able to put a formal security patch schedule/policy in place - or make it easier to automate patching altogether, if that's their thing.

It makes complete and total sense for security agencies to get advance notice and patch up before public announcement, because even with WSUS or automated VM patching through vSphere/XS/Hyper-V, patch propagation can take a while. I'm actually rather glad that this is the case for networks that, y'know, control ICBMs. Plus a lot of defense contractors are given the same privilege, actually.

Ah bah finalement on est d'accord :)

&gt; Au risque de me répéter, dissocier mariage homosexuel et PMA pour les homosexuels est intellectuellement malhonnête.

Non mais encore une fois il n'y a rien de mal a vouloir ou ne pas vouloir la PMA. Perso je ne pourrais pas m'en foutre plus. Mais je pense juste que ce n'est pas intellectuellement satisfaisant que de condamner une chose pour une autre. Ni bon pour le débat de manière générale. 

Je condamne principalement la méthode (manifestations, menaces, coups de pubs (d'ailleurs principalements destinés a l'égo de Frigide Barjot)) que le débat derriere.

true,Vilur,null,null,"Hi! Welcome to Barcelona, I hope you can enjoy and like it :) I'll try to answer all your questions, with approximate values and stuff.

 * There are plenty of areas in the city where you can live, but depending on your lifestyle you may enjoy some more than others. I'd recommend you to look in the zone we call ""Eixample"", which you can basically see in the map as the great zone where the streets form ""squares"". You could take Catalunya Place as the center of the city. From there all the zone above (opposite direction from the sea), right, and left is a good zone to live. I'll tell you some more about some zones:
 
 1. Eixample left (as mentioned above): with high price ranges, but definitely not the cheapest. We're talking about 700-900€ for an average 50m2 (2 room) appartment. Safe zone, wide streets, full of shops, etc.
 
 2. Eixample right: Renewed zoned, pretty safe, well communicated and plenty of services. The price here for the example appartment from above may be 500-700 in the farthest from Plaça Catalunya Zone, and increasingly more expensive as nearer to it.
 
 3. Gracia: Nice zone, with all the services from the city but a more ""townslike"" atmosphere. Lots of partying at nights, good for young, and socially active people. Safe zone too, can be cheaper than eixample, we're talking about 600-800€ for a similar appartment.
 
 4. Sarrià: The zone is great, living neighbourhood with small businesses, schools, etc. There you can find really expensive appartments, but may also be lucky enough to find one in the same price range as in the ""Eixample"".
 
 5. Pedralbes: ""High"" zone of the city, expensive, usually houses instead of flats, expensive as fuck and not as well communicated as other zones, as people there usually moves by car.
 

The zones to avoid are: El Rabal (though not as unsafe as people may say), Poble Nou, Montjuic, Guinardó, Sant Marti, El Born and Barri Gòtic. Of course there may eb certain streets better than others, and going for a walk there can be awesome, but i feel that in general is not the zone you'd want to live.

Of course, if your lucky and/or look lots of sites, offers, etc, you can find better prices than the ones listed above. A good time to look for them is August, as lots of students appartments are emptied.

 * Spanish banks, what to say... ING is the one who has lower expenses for cards and you can get money from a lot of ATMs. La Caixa is a safe choice as it is a solid bank, and has the largest number of offices and ATMs in the city and Catalunya.

 * About phone services, you'll find them expensive for the low cality service they offer. Any choice is just as bad as the others. The one with wider coverage may be Movistar but it's also the most expensive. I'd recommend that you check offers in Movistar, Vodafone and Orange, but be sure to check Simyo, Yoigo and Pepephone, as these threee seem to me more fair and cheaper.

 * Cost of living: Here it's totally depending on your lifestyle, and although the life in Barcelona isn't cheap compared to other cities in the country, it may be cheaper than in your home city.

 * Looking for a job can be really hard in here nowadays. I'd recommend you sign up in job websites like infojobs and have a look there. The sector with more job offers are tourism and software engineer related jobs.

 * Can't recall now of any advice or tip, or there are just maybe to many! The biggest one i can give you is having common sense and asking if you got any doubt.

I hope this is useful and helps you and your fiancee with the moving!

true,Fellowsparrow,null,null,"&gt;Débattre à la francaise c'est manifester? Une manifestation par définition c'est une démonstration de force, pour forcer une issue. Non un débat. 

Je comprends mieux tes réticences à considérer la Manif pour tous comme une entité apportant quelque chose au débat.
Je trouve cependant étrange que tu considères une manifestation comme étant ""une démonstration de force, pour forcer une issue"", alors que pour beaucoup de Français (en particulier à gauche), la manifestation est l'une des formes les plus élémentaires et les plus légitimes d'expression démocratique.

La manifestation est même l'une des principales solutions aux failles d'une démocratie représentative (puisque la démocratie est quelque chose d'un peu plus ambitieux que de signer un chèque en blanc pour cinq ans à un élu).

J'ajouterais que les manifestations massives de la Manif pour tous sont restées relativement pacifiques. Quand tu as 200 jeunes qui affrontent les CRS dans une manif qui rassemble 400 000 personnes, on peut bel et bien affirmer que les choses n'ont pas trop dérapé. 

A quoi ressemblerait selon toi un ""vrai débat"" ? Les opposants au mariage homosexuel (qui ne se limitent pas aux membres de la Manif pour tous) ne se sont pas contentés de vociférer, ils ont aussi avancé pas mal d'arguments. Tu sembles faire comme si les opposants à cette loi n'avaient pas vraiment d'idées et qu'ils étaient simplement motivés par la ""réaction"". Pourtant, ces personnes n'ont pas manifesté à cause d'une peur irrationnelle, mais aussi à cause de leurs idées, certaines valant le coup d'oeil. 

&gt;Je condamne principalement la méthode (manifestations, menaces, coups de pubs (d'ailleurs principalements destinés a l'égo de Frigide Barjot)) que le débat derriere. 

Encore une fois, condamner le principe de la manifestation en tant que tel, je trouve ça étrange. Tu connais beaucoup d'autres moyens pour le citoyen lambda de faire entendre sa voix dans une démocratie représentative? Je te rappelle que la Manif pour tous a également tout fait pour provoquer un référendum. Ils ont saisi le Conseil économique, social et environnemental sur la question en récoltant 700 000 signatures. C'est l'un des épisodes les plus impressionnants (et aussi l'un des échecs les plus cuisants) de l'opposition au projet de loi. Par ailleurs, tu te souviens peut-être qu'au moment exact du vote de la loi à l'Assemblée nationale, un groupe de jeunes a tenté de déployer une banderole dans l’hémicycle. Hors de lui, Claude Bartolone a demandé à ce qu'ils soient expulsés, en criant ""Les ennemis de la démocratie n’ont rien à faire dans l’hémicycle ! Sortez-moi ces excités !"". L'ironie, c'est que sur cette banderole était précisément écrit le mot ""référendum"". Les ennemis de la démocratie réclamaient donc un peu plus de démocratie...

A part ça, j'aimerais que tu me parles des ""menaces"" en question. Quant à Frigide Barjot, si tu penses qu'elle s'est lancé dans cette galère pour être sous le feu des projecteurs, c'est un peu court. Au plus fort de la contestation, elle était sous antidépresseurs et recevait des menaces de mort de façon quotidienne. Sa famille est maintenant déchirée et elle a perdu beaucoup d'amis. Elle était dès le départ consciente que cet engagement représentait beaucoup de sacrifices et peu de récompenses, en ne se faisant pas beaucoup d'illusions sur l'issue du combat.

&gt;Je pense simplement que les leaders de la manif ne le cherchent pas le débat. Je pense qu'ils cherchent a récupérer les mécontentements de beaucoup de gens sur beaucoup de sujets pour : a) bloquer toute réforme b) se montrer et gagner de la popularité

La Manif pour tous s'est un peu agrandie à cause de ceux qui étaient globalement mécontents du mandat de Hollande jusqu'à présent. Mais les leaders du mouvement se focalisent sur des sujets bien précis qui leur tiennent personnellement à coeur: ça fait par exemple quinze ans que Tugdual Derville travaille sur ces questions au sein de l'Alliance Vita. Ces gens-là veulent (et ne peuvent que) s'emparer d'un certain nombre de questions de société: dire qu'ils veulent ""bloquer toute réforme"" relève donc du fantasme. Tu n'entendras jamais une Frigide Barjot ou un catholique qui a manifesté dénoncer la prochaine réforme du Conseil constitutionnel. Par contre, la réforme sur l'euthanasie à venir va être un enjeu important: la question de l'euthanasie est l'un des thèmes de prédilection de l'Alliance Vita depuis longtemps, et les catholiques sont particulièrement impliqués et pointus sur le sujet.

&gt;Sans chercher a défendre quoi que ce soit de concret socialement.

Lorsque des cathos provinciaux qui n'ont vraiment pas l'habitude de manifester se mettent à débarquer en masse à Paris à quatre reprises, c'est qu'ils sont motivés par quelque chose qu'ils jugent important. Cette loi modifie profondément un modèle de société, et Christine Taubira a elle-même défini le projet comme ""une réforme de civilisation"". On peut toujours estimer qu'il y a plus important, ça n'enlève rien aux enjeux qui sont propres à cette loi.

Tu condamnes la ""méthode"" de cette opposition au mariage homosexuel. Mais il y aurait aussi beaucoup à redire sur les méthodes utilisées pour promouvoir cette loi. On a eu droit à des slogans marketing creux et superficiels, le ""mariage pour tous"" en étant un bel exemple. On a eu droit à toutes sortes d'amalgames pour tenter de disqualifier les opposants (""ils s'opposent au mariage gay, donc ils sont homophobes, donc ce n'est qu'une bande de fanatiques haineux et crétins, voir même des fascistes en puissance""). Je te renvoie à Pierre Bergé, qui a sorti d'énormes conneries sur le sujet, avec une régularité qui force l'admiration. Et ne parlons même pas des dérives policières, avec des forces de l'ordre qui ont multiplié les arrestations arbitraires pour des motifs ridicules. Je pourrais continuer encore longtemps sur le sujet, mais le pavé que je suis en train d'écrire est déjà suffisamment énorme comme ça.

Enfin, pour en revenir à notre désaccord d'origine, je te propose d'écouter l'émission de France Culture que je t'ai passée en lien. 

http://www.franceculture.fr/emission-du-grain-a-moudre-et-maintenant-la-pma-pour-tous-2013-05-27

On peut y écouter une sociologue favorable à la PMA pour les couples homosexuels et un professeur de philosophie qui s'y oppose et a d'ailleurs manifesté dans le cadre de la Manif pour tous.

C'est l'occasion de découvrir que les opposants à cette loi ont bel et bien des arguments intellectuels à avancer et qu'ils sont ouverts au débat. Les cinq dernières minutes du débat sont particulièrement révélatrices: les deux intervenants sont d'accord entre eux sur le fait que ""le mariage pour tous"" entraîne nécessairement l'introduction de la PMA et de la GPA sur l'agenda politique.

The studio is beautiful and clean, the staff is very welcoming and friendly and the atmosphere is very positive among the students, with a lot of diversity (old and young people, some more heavy weighted than others, advanced or absolute beginners). 
In class, you are encouraged to do your best but also to take care of yourself and you aren't expected to perform or ""show off"" (it's the first bikram studio I've been to, so I don't know how it is on other places). The teachers are good and some of them are very good (as in : giving a lot of extra tips on the alignment, correcting your posture a lot and being generally strict on the discipline yet cheerful). (I can recommend you my favorite ones by PM, if you wish). 
As for language, all the teachers are fluent in English and French (the studio is held by an American (or maybe British) woman). There is a daily class in English but in the other classes, the teachers can talk to you in English if you need to.

That is the thing. Giving some of the customers of your products preferential treatment is normal. So if you trust some of your larger companies enough that they keep it to themselves you can alert them early of security issues while fixing them for the rest of your customers, so they can take additional steps and use a workaround while the fix is developed. This does not only apply to Microsoft, but to any other software company I suppose. 

But there is a difference. The current information we have alludes to the agencies using the information to access third party computers via the security hole. And that Microsoft is fully aware of that and even sets up the information in that way. 

This is a huge difference. And a breach of trust.

Same with PRISM. What everyone assumed before the scandal broke was that individual access is granted to individual sets of data through court orders. Wiretapping. It happens in a lawful was in every country. A judge decides and you are not being told. Otherwise there would be no point to wiretapping. Everyone knew/assumed that this was the case with US companies as well. They would get individual sets of data through court orders. 

What is alluded currently is that they get all the data. Everything. From Microsoft, Yahoo, Google and Skype and then dig through it themselves using data mining. And decide on a case by case basis not to actively look at the data from US citizen. 

There is a huge difference.

=======================
&gt;If the EU thinks that it can safeguard its interests through sanctions, it will have to realise that **it is no longer facing the China of the past**
==========
&gt;“We are now looking at a **Beijing which positions itself as an equal to the US and superior to a lot of smaller nations,”** said a Western diplomat.
===
&gt;Prof Chen said a majority in China would agree that the EU’s slower growth rates compared with many emerging markets had left it in relative decline. “In addition, the EU faces a lot of problems,” he said. “If it continues down this path, **it will be declining absolutely.”**


I've been saying it over and over again, the world is changing and we're moving from a American-dominated Hegemony (or as some have called it, *""Pax Americana""*), to a multi-polar world in this new so-called *""Asian Century""*. 

The west, and by west I mean the United States, European Union, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, have a choice. They either adapt to the coming changes or fade into obscurity and insignificance. China and India (and by extension, their allies in BRICS) are rising, and we have to consolidate our own spheres of influence into a single economic block if we wish to compete and maintain both our standards of living and culture, no matter how different they may all seem looking from the inside out. 

I'd like to point out [this TED talk](http://youtu.be/2JSZ66uMRwc?t=12m35s). that I think explains part of my feelings pretty well.

&gt;""On trade this is starting to happen. U.S.-led global architecture is dead. Going forward you will either have global architecture that is not U.S.-led, or you will have U.S. and other led architecture that is not global. **I suggest we go that way.** We go narrower and we go deeper.

I believe that both the US-EU FTA, or Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP),  and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) embody this approach, and that both are necessities for both our countries/confederations adapting and surviving prosperly and successfully in a ever-changing world. 

And more importantly, the coming decisions will also define the quality and regulation of our goods, the goods we use everyday. One of the most important aspects of the US-EU FTA, or Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and one of the foremost problems, is Europeans thinking that the threat is European standards being reduced to American standards, but the REAL PROBLEM is European standards being reduced to CHINESE standards if this deal doesn't go through. I feel my view is best [represented in this article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22909209) from the BBC: 

&gt;**4. Chinese standards edged out**

&gt;It will be tricky for the two regions to agree on exactly the same regulations, but the hope is they will harmonise enough to bring huge savings to manufacturers.

&gt;Companies tend to build things that are easier to sell in the biggest market, says Stokes, so a huge market with common technical standards will be a huge draw for global investment.

&gt;""You would be creating a market with no tariff barriers and diminished regulatory barriers, worth about $30tn (£19tn), which would basically set the technical standards for the immediate future.

&gt;**""Samsung has made it clear, for example, that its next generation of mobile phones will be built to either a European-American standard, or a Chinese one. And that if Brussels and Washington fail to come up with common specifications, it will be Beijing's standards that Samsung adopts.**

&gt;**""And perhaps more importantly, these regulations would be openly arrived at, transparent and accountable, unlike those developed by the Chinese government.""**

&gt;Car manufacturers in the US and EU have already agreed common standards in things that the average consumer never sees, says Stokes, like the way batteries in electric cars are tested and operate.

&gt;To avoid car companies having to come up with separate electrical vehicles for each market, he says, they want to build cars in Europe they can sell in the US and vice-versa.

&gt;Listen, I agree fully that American standards need to be raised in certain areas. Completley agree. But let's not forget we all have faults. It was only a couple months ago that horse meat was showing up in beef burgers, or how no meat was found in Icelandic Meatpies, or the huge organized crime influence in the entire European mean industry. 

&gt;We both have quirks and fucked up problems, there's no denying this, but god damn if I don't want to see European-American Standards over shitty Chinese ones.

Either Chinese or European-American Standards will dominate in the future, and who ever wins will have a innumerable increase is that particular state/states' soft power. 

And as far hard power, you're right, *for now*. But China is merely being patient and logical in it's military-build up. It has no reason to ignite a *immediate* arms race, but it has plenty of reason to do so slowly and controlled over time. At the moment there is a type of ""delayed"" arms race in Asia, which yes, is moving at a snails pace, but it IS STILL moving. China, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan and South Korea are all steadily increasing their militaries to check each other, but primarily to check China. 

The Chinese see American domination of their Line of Communications and of the region as a threat, maybe not a threat to confront violently, at least not now or immediately, but STILL A threat. This has only exacerbated by America's ""Pivot to the Pacific"" and away from Europe and our old Cold War-stance and strategies. Up to 60% of our military (or at least 60% of the USAF and USN) will be based in the Pacific now.

I will definitely agree that having Greek ancestry doesn't necessarily make one Greek, but I would argue that 1) Being Greek Orthodox (or your family being Orthodox if you are, say atheist, et al) and 2) constantly making gyros and baklava are enough to make someone with Greek ancestors a Greek American.

Unfortunately, all I really retain from my Dutch heritage is a kickass last name.

OOH! Nationalism in Europe! I love this one, because what I have found is that most continental Europeans are rather nationalistic, just not really a fan of use of force. Like here in Germany, they will (rightfully) defend Hefeweizen, and Bratwurst and Wagner and Neue Deutsche Welle and *Das Boot*, so they are culturally as nationalistic as we are. But bring up something like their military involvement in Afghanistan or on the Syria-Turkey border, or Spagetti-Monster help us all, further European integration and they start to get nervous.

true,Staxxy,YAFrance,France,"Les manifestations initiales ont été organisées par le Mouvement pour la gratuité des transports, qui est composé de quelques dizaines de membres seulement et organise de petites manifestations chaque année depuis 2005. Cette année pourtant, avec l'augmentation du prix des tickets et le mécontentement montant contre une forte inflation et le ralentissement de la croissance économique qui ont entraîné des licenciements et peu d'emplois décents proposés aux jeunes, tout cela a explosé en une manifestation de masse.  L'absence de tout programme bien défini ou d'une direction révolutionnaire et la prédominance des couches des classes moyennes ont laissé ce mouvement ouvert à diverses influences, y compris celles de la droite politique. Des slogans s'opposant à tous les partis politiques et dénonçant la corruption et les impôts élevés sont devenus de plus en plus courants, et les groupes organisés de voyous ont attaqué ceux qui portaient des pancartes et des bannières de partis de gauche.  À Rio jeudi, un groupe de quelques dizaines de membres du CUT (Central Unica dos Trabalhadores), la confédération syndicale qui est la plus proche du PT, a été prise à partie, ses membres frappés et ses banderoles déchirées.  À Sao Paulo, des éléments considérés par les médias comme ""nationalistes"" ont attaqué des membres de partis de gauche, s'emparant de leurs drapeaux et de leurs banderoles pour les brûler dans la rue.  La confusion politique et la capacité des éléments de droite à l'exploiter est la conséquence d'une décennie où le PT a été au pouvoir, une machine politique corrompue qui affirmait faussement représenter la classe ouvrière, ainsi que de l'intégration des syndicats dans l'appareil d'état. Les syndicats n'ont joué aucun rôle important dans les manifestations de masse.

Un mouvement de masse sans programme et perspectives politiques révolutionnaires apportées par un Parti d'avant-garde de masse fait face à la dispersion, à la cooptation et à la défaite.

Pour que le mouvement de masse au Brésil évite un tel sort, il faut bâtir une nouvelle direction révolutionnaire afin de mobiliser la classe ouvrière sous une perspective avant-gardiste dans la lutte pour le socialisme.

Well, if the privacy of your citizens is your concern, and not another country involving itself in the internal politics of your own confederation *(a legitimate concern and one I am disgusted my country violated)* than where is the outrage with Sweden's [FRA Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRA_law) and [Titan Traffic Database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_traffic_database)?

The TED Talk I linked explicitly states that and I agree. But by China and India rising, I do believe, personally, that by extension the others will grow by consolidating themselves under China's shadow through trade agreements. I believe China or India will be the leaders of a BRICS-like economic bloc much like America is of the TPP and TTIP. 

&gt;And China will run against a concrete wall pretty soon. Because internally, they will not attack the problems they would need to attack to become a stable middle income country. Because if they were, it would challenge the position of power of the CCP. And my guess is, China's leadership will chose power over country.

And that is my point. China *cannot* hit that concrete wall, and the CCP knows it. The Great Recession will be a damn joke if China's real estate bubble bursts, but it is good to see that China has recently took steps in ""easing"" this. Better to shoot themselves in the foot now than loose a leg later. 

But anyway, the way I see, whether economically or militarily, China **needs to expand** if it want's to stay unified, coherent and a influential world actor. This includes usurping the U.S.'s influence in region, which given the ""Pivot to the Pacific"", where 60% of both the USAF and USN will now be stationed, my own country is taking it pretty seriously. 

China reminds me of the U.S. Pre-WWI/Pre-WWII, a sleeping giant just bidding it's time before waking up. It shouldn't be underestimated. They have the industrial might and population for it, but not the resources. **And THAT'S the scary part.** The world is changing, the Asian Century looms, and an ever-assertive and aggressively, and frighteningly, desperate, China is all but a guarantee.

Are there paid supporters in front of (political) party headquarters?

Our (BNT - Bulgarian National Television) reporter Rossen Tsvetkov managed to enter “under cover” into one such “scheme”. 

Let us see what sort of promises and instructions he received, as well as which party’s headquarters he was led to, in order to sit for hours and create a crowd.

“The day is Tuesday, in Sofia’s residential quarter “Ovcha Koupel”, several hours before the next mass protest in Sofia. I find myself in a group of young people, who have received an offer, in the gym where they work out, from a man, going by the name “Danny”, to participate in a protest in exchange for 30 leva (15 EUR). They say Danny works as security for some establishment (bar, restaurant or night club). They explain to me what is expected of us. 
“You sit there, have a cup of coffee, and you go home”. 
“You are there for the numbers (for the count)”. 

We meet with the Danny in question, he speaks of himself as one of the organizers. He has our names put down in a list. He explains that his fee is higher than ours. He receives a bonus for the additional people he brings in. 

“We give 30 (leva). Depends on the number (of people). Us organizers - we get 50.”

“Well 30 is good, what... bro(ther).”

“You don’t do anything, bro”

“You’ll see what “bulls**t the whole thing is.”

“You only sit, no shouting, no nothing. You don’t shout.”

“You just sit there and look (leer).” You sit on the curb and you sit around, bro.”

Danny takes us, a little before 18:00, to the space between the Parliament and the  Alexander Nevski Cathedral, where there are already hundreds of muscular, young men, some of them - colleagues of his from the security job. 

“Did you take their names down?”

They are having conversations away from us, which we have no way of hearing”. 

Danny leads us through the side streets, and we arrive at the Ataka ( “Attack” or Ataka Political Party) headquarters, while we receive more important instructions on the way.

“If journalists ask you “Are they giving you money?”, watch out so that somebody doesn’t say “Yes they are giving”.

“What are you doing here? - Touching our d***s  - that’s what we’re doing”.

“You’re not going over there where the other crowd is - to go and shout and throw stuff”. “We sit here on the side, you sit with me. You’re not going down with the crowds- these - Levski Zapad (Levski West- extreme football hooligans). They are still with us, but you don’t go there to fight and so on.”

“Tell them whatever you want, just don’t say that they give (us) money.”

“Get some (playing) cards - play cards. Whatever you want to do.”

“When it’s all over - is that when we go to see you for the money?”

“Yeah yeah”

The blocked street is split in half by the car from which the leader of Ataka is giving speeches. We pass without problems. We have to stay only on one side, watched closely by Danny, who, as visible from our recording, knows well all of the people gathered there. This man, speaking to Danny, was seen in the blocked zone on Monday. He was there today, in front of the President’s Office. Our group grows with more young men, led by Danny. The “buffer zone”, where the access is restricted, we can closely hear the speeches. Danny is in the company of the people, he was having a conversation with earlier. We just sit around for four hours. Around 22:00 it becomes clear that the protesters are headed towards the Ataka headquarters. THey tell us to get up. 

(Unclear profanity)

Thanks to the police force, the protesters don’t reach our point and there is no further tension that night. After one hour, we learn that we will receive the money on the next day, and now we are only to be reimbursed for the taxi ride home. 

“So now Dankata (Danny) will pay for the taxis. How many people are we?”

“Now they just come here and count us, and tomorrow at noon we get the money. Dankata will give them to me”. 

They begin a check following the lists. They are counting us”.

(Man counting to 15)

“Tomorrow you’ll call me for this?”

“I’m waiting for my money.”

“I’ve given you 26 leva (13 EUR), come together as a group.”

While Danny is placing us in the taxis, he is discussing the list. 

“How many people do I have under my name? Take a look at the list” 
“In the end I have 6 people. Me, four (others) and Tasev.”

“The whole scheme bro...Today it was easy...Yesterday was completely different.”

“Yesterday they wanted your name, you had to show....

“They don’t ask for your ID Card, you tell them your EGN (PIN - Personal Identification Number), do you understand?”

“We’ll sort them out with the PINs, we’ll sort everything out.”

The next day they tell me that there is a new requirement - men have to weigh above 95 kilograms ( ~ 210 pounds). There is no way for me to go, because I don’t fit the new criterion. I decide not to take the 30 leva for the 6 hours of sitting around either. 

To sit around in one place for 6 hours and to get paid for it, is actually not a crime, according to the criminal code. Its a question of choice and morals. ",0,1371895051,null,0,false,0,canyq2x,t3_1gulao,t1_canyq2x,t3_1gulao,null,1430722489,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Hell, I would love to see Europe consolidate as a strong, unified western power capable of competing in a Multi-Polar world and adapting to the upcoming *""Asian Century""* as it has been deemed, but another part of me, regrettably, sees it falling apart due to nationalist and eurosceptic motivations. At which point the divided countries, a shadow of the influence and power they once possessed as the EU, would continue to be dominated politically and economically by the Russia, the U.S. and China. 

Another part of me sees Europe unified, but not growing closer to America like I want; thus both our countries no longer being capable of helping preserve Western Influence in the new global framework taking shape. This leads me to fear that both our countries will inevitably shoot themselves in the foot by not growing closer, condemning them both to obscurity, which while not making them insignificant, taking away any soft/hard power they had together in cooperation, as the Western world, in influencing the growing juggernauts of China, India and any BRICS economic bloc they might form.

true,WunderBoss,null,null,"Vilur already gave you a lot of good advice, here's some more of the top of my head that you might be unaware of:

- When looking for a flat, 90% of the announcements on idealista.com and all those websites are by agencies. You can usually spot this near the phone number, it says something like *Profesional, Finques Jorge*, example [see here](http://i.imgur.com/k4V6Gqf.png). They will charge 12.1% of a yearly rent as commission, when you sign the contract (10%, with an added 21% V.A.T. on that number). So in this case, an 800€ flat will cost you about 1000-1100€ in commission fees. You can try to avoid this by searching for a ""Particular"" (private person), where there is no such fee. But this limits your options a lot. Look at it like this: If the announcement is by a professional, then the price is simply 12% higher than what is stated. Also you will be required to pay a security deposit of about 2 months rent. Ask where the money will be deposited! It should be an official institution (I can't remember the name), exactly for this purpose.

- It gets very *hot* in the summer, and quite chill in the winter. So ideally you have a flat with an air-condition and a heating (best with radiators). Most cheap flats have **neither** (yes, no heating at all). Air-conditioned flats are far from being standard here, and often when the ad says aircon, it means that in one room of the flat there is an aircon installed, but it could be only in the living room. Which doesn't help when you're trying to sleep at night.

- I would think about getting something on [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) for the first month and searching the flat when you're here. There is just too much horrible flats here (I've seen quite some).

- The best way to get around the city is using the metro. Trains run every 3-5 minutes in both directions and the network gets you almost anywhere. Buses are a slower fallback, but generally they work, too. At least better than what I've seen in the US so far. You can also get yourself a [bicing card](https://www.bicing.cat/es). Those are bicycle stations spread all over the city that allow you to get around quickly too.

- Cost of living depends on your lifestyle obviously. Some examples:
  - Metro or bus ride: 1€ (when bought as 10er ticket, single ride: 2€)
  - Dinner for two in a restaurant: around 40€ (depends on drinks)
  - [Döner Kebab](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:D%C3%BCr%C3%BCm_D%C3%B6ner.jpg): 4€
  - Small Subway menu: 5€
  - Large Big Mac menu: 7€
  - 1 kg of bananas: 2€
  - Small beer in a neighborhood bar: 2€
  - Pint of beer in a touristy pub: 4.50€

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Yeah, because China and India get along to well. Have you had a look at India's development over the past 20 years? 

It's not the past twenty that matter, it's the next twenty. India and China have the *potential* to be the world's next Great Powers. They have the lion's share of the world's population, that's one hell of a lot of cheap labor, a one huge ass pool for industrial might. And the most scary thing is that they *lack resources*. They HAVE TO expand their influence globally if they want to survive. 

&gt;They are doing pretty shitty, to put it mildly. East Africa will be developed before India is. 

And a good part of East Africa's development IS BECAUSE OF CHINA. The money and capital China is dumping into East Africa goes to show my point of how committed China is of securing and expanding it's influence. China's assertiveness and aggressiveness won't just back off, they need the raw resources like East Africa provides if they wish to survive, and they'll only be able to quire and secure those by achieving a dominant position in the world economy, and that means competing against the US and EU, which is why I support the US-EU FTA, cause together we're a lot more competitive and sturdy than divided. 

&gt;A country where the military plays a strong role in politics, with politics and government legitimacy heavily based on a racist form of nationalism, with a rejection of free speech as dangerous, etc.

And where did that lead Germany? ;) 

&gt;It has pretty little in common with the US at any point in US history.

China might better resemble Germany Pre-WWI politically/culturally, but I stand by my previous statement that militarily and economically, it more closely resembles the United States. Small military, isolationist *(in China's case it's forced)*, but still a strong industrial base and large population (when you compare the U.S. back then to the individual European states). The only difference is that China lacked the resources the U.S. had,  which makes this problem worse, especially when they have the attitude and culture of a Pre-WWI Germany. 

And I'm not trying to create boogymen, but let's remember everybody thought in 1910 that a European war was impossible due to the interlocked nature of the the regional economy. ;) ",0,1371896229,null,0,false,0,canyun4,t3_1gt4ib,t1_canyun4,t1_canyne8,null,1430722430,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

This claim about ""everybody is doing it"" is not helpful, especially coming from people who have clearly no idea about the huge differences between the practices in the 27 EU nations.

You also gloss over the fact that what these agencies do is very different. Data retention stores information about data - who is talking to whom. The whole NSA scandal goes far beyond that, they store - as far as we know - also what is being said, they get unhindered access to email accounts, cloud space, etc. This is a level of routine access most EU agencies do not have. The fact that Microsoft informed US agencies of discovered zero-day-exploits long before the released fixes for it means that no EU business should use Microsofts products any more. Few people are aware that several EU nations have been warning companies against the use of US based cloud services for legal reasons. Now this warning should apply to basically all and any US based service. 

So yes, there are many things within in the EU that need to be addressed. But that's more or less futile, until we address the fact that the US seems to believe their laws trump ours.

Any country has that potential. Its reality what matters. And India's reality is, well, no.

&gt; that's one hell of a lot of cheap labor

Having a huge population is a curse that hinders development. China recognized that and implemented the one child policy. India didn't. India's little growth is eaten up by all the new people they get every year. China's growth can be re-invested for more growth. 

Most countries have ""cheap labor"", but that doesn't help you to grow if the environment is not right. Textile that leaves China for being to expensive moves to Vietnam, Bangladesh, maybe Cambodia. India's political and cultural system isn't a good place to be for business.

&gt; The money and capital China is dumping into East Africa

They are manly trying to keep their construction companies busy and to buy political influence.

Briitish folk forgets about Battle of London, Germans and some certain Jews forget that for every Jew killed from ""polish"" hands there were probably 10 or 100 saved by other polish hands. It's like everyone would say how nazi Germany was and at the same time forgot to mention about some very noble Germans. I forgot guy's name but there was German officer who helped Jews in concentration camp with all his money and power. From our point of view, this series try to show ONLY noble Germans and ONLY bad Poles which suggests that Polish military fomrations and most Polish folk were officially agreeing and helping with holocaust.

See what I mean? Just understand that some of us are very angry and well... I don't exactly agree with title of this post but I certainly understand OP's anger.

Oh yeah, and this series does not show historical truth almost at all, not only with holocaust. ",0,1371900835,null,0,false,0,canzcwh,t3_1gujlu,t1_canzcwh,t1_canyrdi,null,1430722192,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

Because the economic problem can only partly be attributed to Greece's incompetence and corruption. A lot of blame also lies with the structure of the EU and particularly the eurozone.

Usually I manage to piss of both right/conservative and left/activist people simultaneously, because I'm mixing a general thoughtful approach with a personal bias.

  * Immigration should depend mostly on the academic qualification / the age / and the benefits for the host country. It should be way easier for qualified people to come and work (some visas are currently delayed for months). I think it is unrealistic to have a job offer before applying for such visas. So generally all under 30 people with a certain degree, should have the opportunity for a one-year visa without any restrictions and almost no bureaucratic efforts. It should be easier to swap between different types of visas and prosperous shouldn't be send back due to visa expiring. 

  * However I have certain bias towards some countries  - based on personal experience. For instance I'm sceptic towards russian, african and arab immigration, but extremely positively biased towards [latin]-american (especially mexican), israeli and ukrainian immigrants. I know that this is very personal (some say racist), and will never be part of our legislation. Yet we are about to determine the composition of future societies.

And, the countries were helping, provided that the Greeks wants to stay in the Euro which I understand that the Greek people wants if you look at the polls.  There is absolutely no way that oils have happened without money, debt reconstruction, other countries tax payers absorbing the debt etc.  or, are you saying that it could have happened? How were you going to manage that? Please explain, I would love to hear.  So,  the Greek got what they wanted, you just do not seem to like the prize and that it was obviously mistakes made- but what save hasn't ? 


Yes, Greece's help were not perfect but for the average tax payer Greece has been nothing but a cost.  I too think more financial institutions should have taken more fall, but I also think that the EUro is wrongly constructed, that countries should follow the Maastricht treaty, Greece should never been let in and certainly not saved to stay in.  That is not lying, nor are most ""you people"" as you seem to claim.

It will take more time and cooperation in the EU for there to be any institutional trust between the UK and the EU, especially on matters related to security in the same way there is between the UK, the commonwealth realms and the US. There is a common language, cultural similarities and a habit of cooperation that has developed. It will take a long time to move away from that.

We have two separate privacy issues really. The first is countries spying on their own citizens' communications, the second is countries spying on foreign citizens' communications. I'd expect most, if not all, nations to be guilty of domestic surveillance, especially historical 'world leader' nations such as France and Germany.

However, what is emerging now is just how widespread and in-depth international surveillance has become. So far, the US and UK have been exposed for widespread spying on foreign communications, but I do not expect it to end there.

The benefit of the wifi hotspot (versus the USB key) is you can flip the switch, wait for it to fire up - and now you have Internet on all your devices (anything that connects to wifi auto-detects the signal and connects).  You can put the device back in your bag while it still serves up Internet.

It's powered by an internal battery which is rechargeable via USB.   The setup was a little confusing a year ago... But you literally only do that once.

(It looks like their details have changed, but perhaps for the better). There's a $139 product which includes Internet for a year.

I hope this helps.

Magna Carta wasn't about democracy, merely restraining the power of the king and protecting the relief and scutage of the barons.

Lord Hailsham calls the Westminster system ""elective dictatorship"". Once a party has a majority in the Commons, it can act pretty much how it wants, regardless of manifesto or previous pledges.

No doubt. And it wasn't something unusual. Every nation in Europe before WWII was more or less antisemitic, and unlike Germany antisemitism in Poland was primarily for economical, not racial reasons.

&gt;lust look at the jedwabne massacre [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedwabne_pogrom they even tried to blame the germans for this massacre

""Some Jews joined a Soviet militia overseeing deportations organized by the NKVD. At least one witness testimony says that during round-ups, armed Jewish militiamen were seen to be guarding those prepared for deportation to Siberia. A total of 22,353 Poles (entire families) were deported from the vicinity. [...] The Nazis distributed propaganda in the area,[21] revealing crimes committed by the Soviets in Eastern Poland and saying that Jews might have supported them. [...] On the morning of July 10, 1941, by the order of mayor Marian Karolak and the town's German gendarmerie,[26] a group of Polish men from around Jedwabne and neighboring settlements was assembled.""

Of course it was a horrible massacre, and that Jews were indeed killed by Poles. But it wasn't that Poles one day spontaneously decided to kill the Jews for no reason at all, the German presence heavily influenced that events. Nevertheless it became a ""token massacre"" so people like you can say ""ha, you see! Throughout the war Poles (stirred up by Germans) killed 400 Jews in a mob, they were literally as bad as German Nazis who in camps built specifically for this purpose murdered 6,000,000 of them!"". Interesingly enough, the same people always seem to forget that it were Poles who saved the most Jews during the war, despite saving Jews being punishable by death in German-occupied Poland.

No, Polish people did not instigate the Holocaust, but they certainly weren't putting on their best behavior when it came to Polish-Jewish relations either. Antisemitism in Poland grew during the inter-war years, despite the opposition of Piłsudski.

You must realize that immediately before the outbreak of war, you had all forms of institutionalized racism against Jews in Poland.  Jewish students had to sit apart on ""ghetto benches"".  Special quotas restricted the amount of Jews that could attend university.  Catholic trade unions barred Jews from joining the doctor or lawyer unions through ""Aryan (lol!) clauses"",while the Jews themselves did something similar.  Jews were barred from receiving welfare benefits.

Between 1935 and 1937 seventy-nine Jews were killed and 500 injured in anti-Jewish incidents.  The Endecja party advocated a boycott of all Jewish businesses. A movement was started to ban kosher food preparation (animal rights used as ""motivation"").

Anti-semitism reached a crescendo directly prior to the German invasion.   In July 1939 the pro-government Gazeta Polska wrote, 

&gt;""The fact that our relations with the Reich are worsening does not in the least deactivate our program in the Jewish question—there is not and cannot be any common ground between our internal Jewish problem and Poland's relations with the Hitlerite Reich.""

As the war petered out, a long period of open violence against (the significantly diminished number of) Jews by segments of the Polish population occurred.  Until 1946 [violence was common](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Jewish_violence_in_Poland,_1944%E2%80%9346).

Just keep in mind that the majority of German soldiers were not evil, and neither were the majority of Poles, but both groups had very twisted views about racial equality.  There is a reason for saying that antisemitism comes *z mlekiem matki*.

But this does not forgive either group, nor does it lessen the guilt of the German organized holocaust.  Just remember that there is both good and bad to be found anywhere; events like the Kielce Pogrom, yet also the fact that the most of the ""Righteous Gentiles"" come from Poland.

But regarding the points made

1) I can understand that this might be a not so clever choice of words. It might be better to call them German organized / run camps in Poland.

2) I think that actually is fine. There were Nazis or Nazi sympathizers everywhere.. certainly fewer in some countries than in others but I do not see anything wrong in this choice of words. 

3) This relates to point 2.. you had anti-semitism everywhere, in some countries more and in others less and Poland certainly had its fair share of that. If a German says that I understand that some might think that is the wrong kind of person to tell someone this.. but it does not change history. And while there where times in which Jews had it better in Poland - especially after 1935 it went downhill and by 1937 you had quotas and segregation for example at universities, many offices etc could only be joined by Christians - effectively expluding Jews (academics, lawers, public offices) etc.. 

4) On the one hand it is understandable that those people affected would want their lost property back...  most of them after all were just civilians. However within Germany they are not the most popular group either as they often come across as borderline nationalist / overly patriotic right wing etc.. So they have some supporters, some opponents.. and many more people who just don't care in Germany. They are probably a much bigger topic in Poland than they are over here.

&gt;any sort of discussion about modern or historical Polish antisemitism, especially if anyone involved is German

True, especially that antisemitism was visible in the entire Europe before the war. But these people now think that there is a plan of changing the history, so most people would start to associated us with the antisemitism, Holocaust, and only us. I already have to go through that sometimes while living in the UK, because ""Schindler's List"" showed something like that. Also people feel that while we are getting blamed for some incidents, world is forgetting about many people who were risking their lives during the WW2 to save Jews. 

&gt;any sort of discussion about German expellees from the so called Recovered Territories (parts of Germany that were incorporated into Poland after WWII)

And then some may say that they were part of Poland before Germans took them, and we can go back and forth with arguments like this. 

a) They were running away from Red Army, as we all know how Germans were treated by them.

On the other hands ... you have LOADS of documentaries, loads of movies and last but not least, loads of people in many countries (and that also includes Germany of course!) that remembers very well what Holocaust was as well as who was responsible for it (no, not Nazi's, but Germans and even a German guy will name it, believe me).
Your problem is your ignorance. You just don't see or just don't want to  see the fact that EVERYONE despite of nationality knows very well who were the bad guys back then. There is only one truth about World War II, Nazis and Holocaust and we all know it and NO ONE will ever ""re-write"" those history facts.

However it seems to be only valid if there are reasons for this (like not yet paid utility cost, possible repair and renovation cost). If it is clear and confirmed by the renter that there are no possible additional cost which might have to be balanced with the deposit then I *think* these time limits do not apply and you should get the money back sooner. 

Keep in mind that the renter can not just spend your money. She has to keep it separate from her own bank account. This means that saying she currently does not have the deposit available would mean she did do something wrong as I understand it as it must be on a separate account and therefore should always be available. Usually deposits are put on a savings account - and when the deposit is returned you should get the deposit plus interest accumulated on that savings account (though the norm I think how exacty the money is saved is up to the contract / renter.

Being against something that you perceive as morally and legally wrong doesn't neccessarily exclude you from doing it in my opinion as long as you dont actually break laws. You just recognize that it is a bad system and it shouldn't really be allowed. 

This almost turns into a philosophical question since laws are very much arbitrary and philosophical. In reality, why do you or dont speed every time you drive a car? Nothing is stopping you physically. You dont drive to fast because of the risks, including being caught. The same goes with most crimes, if the punishment for robbing a bank was a slap on the wrist, most people would still not do it, but it certainly helps that you get a couple of years in the jail at least.

Here in sweden, we even have crimes that have NO punishment at all, like walking against a red signal. It's illegal, but carries no punishment (not even a fine). To me, it makes sense in all it's backwardness. Some things are wrong, but the wrong is soo small you shouldn't have a punishment for it.

So where does that leave us with tax heavens? If you use them for taxed money, all you are doing is being extremely private with your money and prohibiting the state from extracting taxes down the line. Should it be a crime? What punishment should it have?

true,MrMysterious95,EURO,Proud European,"&gt; False. There were only individuals among polish people that mistreated Jews. Most helped them as fellow-victims. Poland did not have guides how to recognize Jews. Many Jews are thankful for help the have received from polish citizens.

And many aren't. Many survived only to find their homes plundered by Polish patriots. And there was a definite way of recognizing Jews - at least men. The Holocaust probably would go out without Poles, but many Poles did help willingly, some for money, some to protect their families, and quite a lot of them out of hatred.

&gt;False again. Antisemitism grew in Europe during the inter-war years. You are telling it like this trend was observed only in Poland. Jews migrated mostly to Poland.

The anti-semitism was certainly growing, and Poland was a military dictatorship, but this does not justify our anti-semitism. Polish Jews, however, were significantly different from the mostly assimilated Jews of the West, that's what made them easy targets for both endek scum and the Germans. And as for migrating mostly to Poland - that's bullshit, Poland expressly encouraged migration to Palestine (both before and after the war), and we didn't even take in German Jews that escaped Hitler's regime.

I don't know if you've heard of the human brain, but it also records images that the eyes see. Security guards can be asked by the police to testify in trials too.

I'm going to have to ask for a link. Obviously government owned CCTV cameras can generally be seen by the police, but those of residential buildings? I've not heard anything of the sort. That is also probably illegal.

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"Bon, je ne suis pas particulièrement fan du concept de lutte des classes, mais statistiquement, on pourrait mettre en évidence des clusters : s'il existe un creux à un endroit de la courbe de distribution des revenus, on pourrait mettre en évidence une notion de classe.

Pour avoir un peu cherché, je n'ai pas réussi à trouver une époque où un tel creux a existé en France au 20e siècle entre la classe pauvre et la classe moyenne. Ca semble bien être une construction médiatique.

On peut faire apparaitre une classe riche, mais il faut utiliser une échelle logarithmique, ce qui se discute.

Par contre, sur l'existence de la classe riche d'un point de vue des des droits, possibilités et opportunités, je pense qu'il existe pas mal d'arguments en faveur de cette construction.

&gt; Par exemple ceux qui savent ou non lire, qui ont la capacité d’accéder à des emplois intéressants, ceux qui ont suffisamment de ressources pour se loger, ou être propriétaire ...

Je pense qu'il existe une différence fondamentale entre ceux qui commencent leur vie professionnelle propriétaires de leur logement et ceux qui sont locataires et parfois bien endettés. Plus précisément, il y a une classe de personnes que la famille met ""à l'abri du besoin"" : c'est à dire qu'ils sont libres de prendre tous les risques qu'ils souhaitent, s'ils échouent, ils ne seront pas à la rue. Ils n'ont pas ""besoin"" de gagner d'argent. S'ils doivent monter une boite pendant 2 ans sans revenus, ils n'auront à sacrifier aucun confort.

Il existe un autre seuil, probablement plus haut, mais plus significatif, où la famille riche n'a pas besoin de l'état et pourrait vivre confortablement en l'absence d'état : quand on a un médecin personnel, un précepteur pour l'éducation des enfants, un ou des gardes du corps, on n'a plus, avec la société, les mêmes relations qu'une personne qui sait que la vie peut être sauvée par un policier, un pompier ou un médecin. 

Au contraire, on peut constater qu'à un certain prix, les prestations privées sont bien plus fiables que le service publique, dont on se désintéresse du coup. Ne comptant pas utiliser les services de l'état, ils estiment forcément payer trop d'impôts.

Tous les riches ne sont pas comme ça, mais la logique de leur intérêt va dans ce sens. Je pense que c'est une différence qui rend légitime la notion de classe : leurs intérêts divergent fondamentalement des gens qui n'appartiennent pas à cette classe.",0,1371917548,null,0,false,0,cao2mjb,t3_1gum9y,t1_cao2mjb,t1_canz2bh,null,1430720639,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4

The fact that every week at least one piece of looted art gets returned is proof enough for me. You won't hear about most of them because they are not *that* important for the media to care. Right before the Merkel-Putin media shouting contest [this one](http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/ns-raubkunst-koeln-gibt-kokoschka-gemaelde-an-flechtheim-erben-zurueck-a-906224.html) was deemed somewhat relevant. [Here](http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst_architektur/juedin-mit-orangen-ist-zurueck-in-der-heimat-1.11661693) is a piece from Poland. [Here](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/beutekunst-der-grosse-raub-12046262.html) is an article about that problem in general.

I'm not knowledgeable enough to give you any piece that's in a process of restitution right now, it's not my business. But it's not that far-fetched to assume that this didn't just magically stop after this week's tuesday.

&gt; Do you expect the state to empty each German household, due to this claim that you can not even show a list of?

true,fuchsiamatter,EURO,European Union,"No. Culture is so much more than cuisine and religion - in fact it is exactly that kind of rationale that bothers me. What about language, what about history, what about poetry, literature, music, theatre, folklore, architecture, art?  What about the differences in focus in education, or national aspirations and ideals? Indeed, to suggest that Greekness is exclusively about food and religion is actually pretty offensive - and it was exactly that attitude towards cultures that now feel so distant to the grandchildren of the initial immigrants that they only have a tourists' understanding of them that I was saying does not suggest a strong tie with their initial place of origin. 

Anyway, baklava is a dessert common to all the Eastern Mediterranean - indeed if anything it has Turkish and not Greek origins. As for Greek Orthodoxy, what makes it Greek is the fact that the liturgies are conducted in Koine Greek - the traditional four Patriarchia are all situated outside of Greece and the territory of the Church more or less covers the areas in the Eastern Mediterranean that used to be a part of the Byzantine Empire. Obviously there is considerable overlap between the Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek people, but then again, what about the Muslim Greeks of Thrace, the Catholics on the islands, and, like I mentioned above, recent immigrants? Do they not count as Greeks or are they lesser Greeks than the rest of us? 

Moreover, the very fact that you reference atheists as separate from Orthodoxy as if the two are mutually exclusive categories signals you as a North American - for example I and all my family are most definitely all Greek Orthodox, although I don't think there is a single person among us who believes in a god or goes to church outside of Easter.

As for nationalism, it depends a lot on who you hang out with - Europeans with an international outlook will not shamelessly display pride in their country the way (in my experience) North Americans will - among the right circles patriotism is a dirty word. It's a division which I would argue is a signifier of the huge cultural shift which is underway as immigrants flood Europe and the EU drifts towards further integration - for people who believe in the European project and and are not hostile to immigrants it's very difficult to retain any other kind of attitude. 

But if you want to look at the dark side, not just Britain, but every single European nation (and I would argue every single nation full stop) still, and sadly, have plenty of old fashioned nationalism.

This is how I see it: a few years ago there's been a crappy Canadian horror called ""The Shrine"". It was about some kind of cannibal cult, and it was set in Poland.

The Kazakhs were also terrified about how they're presented in Borat. Or how ancient Greek culture is shown in Disney Hercules. Or about Russel Crowe being a modern American in ancient Rome, medieval England and colonial America. These are all simplifications, honest mistakes, stereotypes. They're fairly natural.

""8mila euro di contributi pagati dal Comune""**](http://bologna.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/06/22/news/idem_dopo_l_ici_un_altro_caso_-61638177/)


*Un consigliere di opposizione del Comune di Ravenna punta il dito contro il ministro. ""Quando era assessore si fece assumere virtualmente da un'associazione addebitando i costi previdenziali all'ente"". Ma l'avvocato: ""Vicenda di assoluta inconsistenza"".  Il Movimento 5 stelle porta il caso in Parlamento*

RAVENNA - Sono iniziate le verifiche della procura di Ravenna sulle carte che il Comune, attraverso la polizia municipale, ha trasmesso ieri al palazzo di giustizia di Ravenna sulla casa-palestra e il pagamento dell'Imu del ministro dello sport Josefa Idem. Intanto è scoppiata un'altra grana, relativa ai contributi pensionistici, che rischia di complicare la sua posizione.

A tirarla fuori è stato Alvaro Ancisi, consigliere comunale di opposizione. Secondo quanto denuncia, nel 2006, prima della sua nomina come assessore allo Sport, sarebbe stata ""virtualmente"" assunta dall'associazione Kajak, presieduta dal marito Guglielmo Guerrini con lo scopo, secondo il consigliere, di addebitare al Comune gli oneri previdenziali. Gli assessori che per svolgere la propria funzione si mettono infatti in aspettativa dal proprio lavoro dipendente, hanno gli oneri previdenziali pagati del Comune.

L'ipotesi di Ancisi è che il rapporto di lavoro fosse ""fittizio e strumentale"": l'associazione, infatti, ha avuto la Idem come prima e unica dipendente ed ha versato i contributi solo per dieci giornate di lavoro. Dopodichè, con l'aspettativa, per gli undici mesi in cui la Idem ha svolto il suo ruolo di assessore, gli oneri sono stati addebitati al Comune: complessivamente vennero versati 8.642 euro. Poi, del rapporto di lavoro con l'associazione, più nessuna traccia.

L'avvocato: ""Lineare anche sui contributi"". Nessuna irregolarità, né sull'ici, né sul fronte dei contributi. E' la tesi dell'avvocato di Josefa Idem che parlando da palazzo Chigi, fa chiarezza sull'accaduto, definendola una vicenda di ""assoluta inconsistenza"". ""Mi pare che la linearità del comportamento della ministra e la sua lealta' anche nelle cose piccole di ogni giorno sia adamantina e irrefutabile"", ha concluso l'avvocato, limitandosi a scandire l'ordine degli eventi e sottolineando come tutto si sia svolto in base a quanto previsto dalla legge. Idem quell'anno ""non si è presentata alle elezioni, pur avendo fatto l'assessore nella giunta precedente ed è stata però chiamata a svolgere attività di assessore anche nella giunta del 2006"". Il contratto con l'associazione era stato firmato circa un mese prima ed e' precedente alle elezioni amministrative indette dopo l'addio del sindaco Vidmer Mercatali.

M5S contro Idem. Non solo la Lega. Anche il Movimento 5 stelle starebbe preparando una mozione di sfiducia contro il ministro Idem: lo dice il consigliere emiliano Andrea Defranceschi. ""I ragazzi in Parlamento se ne stanno occupando"". ""Stiamo acquisendo documenti, permessi, autorizzazioni, sia al Comune di Ravenna che in Regione. Sarà interessante guardare la concessione edilizia, comunque- ammette il consigliere regionale di Beppe Grillo- devo dire che i vigili hanno lavorato bene e anche il sindaco, che non vuole certo finire nel tritacarne"".

&gt;Encore une fois, condamner le principe de la manifestation en tant que tel, je trouve ça étrange. Tu connais beaucoup d'autres moyens pour le citoyen lambda de faire entendre sa voix dans une démocratie.

Déjà il y en a beaucoup : pétitions, lettres à ton député, vote, débat télévisuel, articles sur journal papier, radio, affiches. La manifestation même si bien francaise"" n'a jamais été un outil d'ouverture au débat même en france. C'est une manière de dire ""voila mon opinion et celle de nombre de gens et on est pas content"". Maintenant les manifestations sont importantes en démocratie oui, je ne dis pas le contraire.

 Mais chercher l'amalgame entre la PMA et le mariage pour tous en cherchant a interdire l'un pour interdire l'autre est une approche antidémocratique.


&gt;A part ça, j'aimerais que tu me parles des ""menaces"" en question. 

Je cite : ""il va y avoir du sang"" ou encore un appel au ""Printemps français"", Bartolone qui recoit des courriers avec de la poudre... Bref le climat n'est pas trop au dialogue.

&gt; Je te rappelle que la Manif pour tous a également tout fait pour provoquer un référendum. Ils ont saisi le Conseil économique, social et environnemental sur la question en récoltant 700 000 signatures. 

Je n'aurais pas été contre le référendum. Cela dit la majorité des sondages, montraient déja une majorité pour le oui donc je ne suis pas sur que ca aurait eut un impact. En pratique, une majorité des députés étant déja en accord avec la loi, le référendum n'étais pas nécessaire non plus. Le référendum n'étant pas un outil systématique et régit par la constitution, il n'est pas nécessaire a chaque loi, surtout si tôt apres avoir élu un gouvernement (qui avait la loi a son programme).

&gt; Quant à Frigide Barjot, si tu penses qu'elle s'est lancé dans cette galère pour être sous le feu des projecteurs, c'est un peu court.  

Oh mais pas qu'elle, Boutin, Copé. J'oserai même dire que l'autre bord s'en sert aussi (pour cacher les autres problèmes).  Les seuls a être motivé par la problématique de société ca semble être tout le monde sauf eux. 


&gt; On a eu droit à des slogans marketing creux et superficiels, le ""mariage pour tous"" en étant un bel exemple. 

Oui ou encore ""Printemps Francais"", ""Manifestation pour tous"", ""Insurrection de la conscience"" (ca  ne veut rien dire au passage).

&gt; ne parlons même pas des dérives policières, avec des forces de l'ordre qui ont multiplié les arrestations arbitraires pour des motifs ridicules. 

Parlons en au contraire: ""violence et port d'arme prohibées"" par exemple. Ca ne me semble pas ridicule comme motif.

&gt; Lorsque des cathos provinciaux qui n'ont vraiment pas l'habitude de manifester se mettent à débarquer en masse à Paris à quatre reprises, c'est qu'ils sont motivés par quelque chose qu'ils jugent important

Oui, par leurs éveques (André 23?). Personellement je préfere ma répubique séculaire, merci bien.

&gt;Enfin, pour en revenir à notre désaccord d'origine, je te propose d'écouter l'émission de France Culture que je t'ai passée en lien.

&gt;http://www.franceculture.fr/emission-du-grain-a-moudre-et-maintenant-la-pma-pour-tous-2013-05-27

&gt;On peut y écouter une sociologue favorable à la PMA pour les couples homosexuels et un professeur de philosophie qui s'y oppose et a d'ailleurs manifesté dans le cadre de la Manif pour tous.

Merci pour le lien, mais ils parlent de la PMA séparément de la problématique du mariage pour tous. Je suis donc assez content de ca :).

&gt;  les deux intervenants sont d'accord entre eux sur le fait que ""le mariage pour tous"" entraîne nécessairement l'introduction de la PMA et de la GPA sur l'agenda politique. 

Je n'ai jamais dit le contraire. Ce que je dis c'est qu'il faut en parler en temps que tel et non camoufler les débats. En ce sens l'émission que tu me lie n'est pas en objection avec ca.

Lyrics in English:

There are people who would never
 Sing a song to somebody, like I do it here now
 They would never sing, not at any price, God forbid!
 Because they feel abashed
 Basically they'd probably like to be cheeky
 And think that would be their biggest misfortune
 And it weighs on them like a heavy stone
 That they feel abashed

I know, one feels the warmth coming up, and it floors oneself
 But sometimes one also thinks that it is not that bad at all
 It is luck even if we don't want it
 That we feel abashed

What seperates humans from chimps
 Is not the smooth skin, the missing tail
 Not that we climb trees worse, no 
 That we feel abashed

Image the men if it would be different
 And a beautiful girl came along
 We just look a little bit at their legs
 Because we feel abashed

And if you see what's threatening mankind today
 One does really see a black card, not even a red one
 And what one can only hope so far is 
 That it feels abashed

These laws predate AKP and are because of Turkey's outdated laws relating to the inability to insult Ataturk, the Turkish state or Turkish copyright holders. A lot of these blocks have been lifted however in recent years. 

I don't really get the butthurt over the lift on the ban on headscarves, the state has no right to impose dress code laws upon its citizens anyway.

Wie weit mag es sein 
bis zum Horizont? 
Diese Frage will ich euch beantworten. 
Steh ich auf der Welt, 
meines Blickes Strahl 
trifft die Erde als Tangente am Horizont. 
Dann um 90 Grad 
Bis zum Erdmittelpunkt 
hab ich den Erdradius. 
Nun zurück zu meinem Kopf - 
Radius plus ein Mensch 
gibt es ein rechtwinkliges Dreieck.

Wie weit ist es bis zum Horizont ?

Diese Entfernung ist ""a"", 
der Radius ist ""b"", 
Mittelpunkt bis Kopf ist die Seite ""c"". 
Nehmen wir den Satz 
des Pythagoras: 

a-Quadrat plus b-Quadrat = c-Quadrat 
Stellen wir dieses um, 
so errechnet sich ""a"" 
aus der Wurzel der Differenz 
zwischen c zum Quadrat minus b zum Quadrat 
Fehlen nur noch die Zahlen.

Wie weit ist es bis zum Horizont ?

Der Erdradius ""b"" 
misst in etwa 6.378.000 m 
C = 6.378.001,70 m 
Bildet man die Quadrate, 
So ist deren Differenz 
21.680.000

4650 m

Also find out what their other fees are, there will be one for sure, maybe two fees.  Usually small like 1-3% of the withdraw.  I had a free USAA checking account when I went last year and it was great.  ATM's are all over the place and open 24 hours a day (unlike the currency exchange places).

Plus, if you go and exchange aaaalll of your money to Euros, then don't use it... you have to pay to exchange it back again.  Just use the ATM and take out like 100 euros every couple of days then just sort of watch it closer to the end of the trip only taking out what you'll need for the day.

Hussein ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of Kurds, Assyrians, Jews and other ethnic minorities. During [Al-Anfal Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Anfal_Campaign)*:

* Destroyed about 4,000 villages (out of 4,655) in Iraqi Kurdistan. Between April 1987 and August 1988, 250 towns and villages were exposed to chemical weapons

* Destroyed 1,754 schools, 270 hospitals, 2,450 mosques, 27 churches

* Wiped out around 90% of Kurdish villages in targeted areas

and during the [1991 uprisings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_uprisings_in_Iraq):

another 80.000 - 230.000 undesirable Iraqi citizens were disposed off.

The only reason Hussein's regime survived for so long is that the US government had seen him as a bulwark against the perceived threat posed by Iran's zealous brand of politicized Islam.

This bastard should had been executed after the first Gulf War in 1990. Dozens thousand lives of Shia Iraqis would have been preserved.
