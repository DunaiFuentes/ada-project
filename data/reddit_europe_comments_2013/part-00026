&gt;From 2015, and by 2020 at the latest, EU fishermen will not be allowed to catch more than a given fish stock can reproduce in a given year. For lovers of Brussels acronyms, this is called the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). 

&gt;Annual allocations of fishing quotas will have to be consistent with longer-term management plans for individual fisheries. This is expected to avoid, or at least reduce, the yearly squabbling between national fisheries ministers in Brussels.
 
&gt;Most importantly, management of fisheries will be largely carried out at the regional level - i.e. member states surrounding a certain sea basin will sort out day-to-day issues among themselves, based on broad principles decided in Brussels.

Other than lowering taxes and other than what u/radaway mentioned of taxing power sources according to the pollution they emit, IMO none whatsoever.

In a perfect world we'd be able to have the best of both however in reality we must make choices, we either tax money away from the people and spend it on solar power or we leave the money be with the people and them will decide for themselves on how they should spend it.

Sure, it's good to have plenty of solar power, but it shouldn't be up to anyone to decide to spend other people's money like that, it's certainly a worse alternative than letting people keep their own money, with the extra income they'll have then they'll be able to buy themselves solar panels or invest in a company researching and developing new alternatives to solar power.. or they can spend their money on something entirely different such as in a better housing conditions for them, better education for their children, a better car for whatever - regardless of what they choose, it will be their choice and they'll be the ones responsible for it.

By not subsidising solar power and letting people keep their money, you'll do much more to provide an economic boost and promote employment than you ever would by subsiding it.

I think every EU member should be allowed to join the Euro if it wishes and conversely only EU members can be part of the Eurozone.

Nevermind that some countries who were members at the time got opt-outs not offered to new members.

For example if the Euro is to work like any other successful monetary union there needs to be transfer payments of about 5% of GDP between it's members. That means each Eurozone member paying into a collective pot and having it dished out to those who need it most.

Assuming the government collects about 50% of GDP in taxes that means 10% of all your country's tax receipts are spent collectively. That's 10% that can't be used to pay down deficits.

Also lots of architecture and culture there.

- Have a boat tour to one of the frisian islands, its a completely different world out there. It is also great in autumn, the stormy north sea is a magnificent sight. I would recommend Amrum.

So? Who do you think did pay the [Kohlepfennig](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohlepfennig), which used to subsidize the coal mining industry in Germany until 1995?

This certainly is a shift in energy policy, with a focus on renewables instead of fossil fuel, but it should hardly come as a surprise that shifting national energy production to new sources doesn't come for free, and that someone has to foot the bill for it. It also shouldn't come as a surprise that, in the end, private consumers will pay a large share of that.

&gt;The renewable energy law takes from the poor and gives to the people who own land and are able to afford the initial investment in PV.

The renewable energy law takes from people who are unable or *unwilling* to install PV panels, and rewards people who are both able and willing to make an initial investment, out of their own money, into renewable energy. It also takes the money from people proportional to the electricity they actually use.

The alternative would be to take it out of general tax funds, and implicitly reward people who use a lot of energy without installing renewable capacity, while implicitly punishing people who conserve energy but still have to pay taxes for subsidies.

EDIT: Let me add that I'm not defending every aspect of the renewable energy law. As with most legislation, there certainly are improvements that could be made. I'm merely saying that ""OMG! Subsidies for political reasons! Oh no!"" is par for the course. In fact, it seems to me as if it would be kinda hard to have a national energy policy without directing it in some kind of way - which usually means not just regulation, but also nudging the market in the desired direction both through incentives (subsidies, deductions, etc.) and disincentives (taxes, fees, etc.).",0,1360322539,null,0,1360322998,0,c8bj53n,t3_182p3f,t1_c8bj53n,t1_c8biysg,null,1431229380,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Also, I've heard that in Germany it's badly seen socially to have young children and work at the same time, so mothers often have to stop working for a long time.

So no, it wasn't just propaganda. We were and we still are converting to renewables.

You can augment this with water-power (dams) but we must have a bigger amount of wind and wave before water can cover the slow-times. Nuclear can't do this, as you need days - if not week's! - planning to augment the power supply. 

Coal can. 

If we hadn't closed the nuclear reactors, it might have been more expensive (due to CO-trading) to built wind/wave... but illogically, due to increasing CO-emissions on short-term, we are making wind/wave cheaper to build (and improving the technology to build ever cheaper and more efficient units for the rest of the world).

And I disagree with the idea of being kind with other people's money.

&gt;Some things, imo, can't be done without it being a province-wide (or larger) effort.

Name me one major development that came through with government planning. From the lightbulb to the automobile to the personal computer to [solar power itself](http://exploringgreentechnology.com/solar-energy/history-of-solar-energy/), all that came from individuals pursuing their separate self-interest with the means they had at their disposal.

Looking at the record of history, if you want to promote development, you should do the exact opposite of subsidising, you should do everything to increase the living standard of everybody by letting them choose for themselves where they should and should not spend their own money.

You trying to do go with the money of the people at large such sounds like a good idea if you ignore the costs but people aren't children and they know what's best for themselves better than you do, give them the means to organise and improve their lives as they see fit, don't take away their money and choose ""oh, now we will subsidy this and that and the taxpayers be damned, they might think they're not getting their money's worth but they don't know what's best for them"", which is in essence what's being gone.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;You say that EURO lacks flexibility, yet You want fiscal union. I have cognitive dissonance reading such demands.

Well perhaps I didn't express myself clearly enough. I am saying to have a good/working currency union, one needs to have a fiscal/banking/transfer (etc) union as well. My point was that the Euro doesn't have that, and that makes it a very dysfunctional union. 

I am not saying that the Eurocountries should start a fiscal union, in fact I don't think so, at the moment. Besides, it is up to them. But, in the future, *if* they actually want the Euro to work somewhat, that is what they are going to need. But, as long as you don't fix that, the Euro will be very, very imperfect. I think that perhaps a lot of countries should drop out, and the Euro should be a smaller, more ""exclusive"" club. In due time, they could start fiscal/bank/transfer etc integration. Above all, I don't think anything should happen without the people of Europe having a chance to have a say in popular votes. 

&gt;I don't think that EURO caused Greek crisis. I don't see any evidence for that claim.

You do realise by saying that, you are blaming the whole Greek crises on solely the Greeks? Second, what is your opinion on Spain and Ireland then? Are they solely all responsible (or perhaps irresponsible) too as well? Nothing to do with the construion of the Euro, at all, is that what you are saying? 

What sort of evicence do you want? 

The *average* loss of internal competitiveness was **20-30 %**  in the GIIPS countries between 1999-2008. That is huge. Particularely for countries that do not have such high and diversified industry as Germany, as for example Greece, that is a lot. At the same time, the prices increased, so several of their core industy suffered. That happened, not because the Greeks were lazy and irresponsible, which people claim, but because that is what happens when you enter a (imperfect) currency union. 

Also, instead of being able to fight the problem they are in now with use of their interest rate, or, during desperate times, devaluation, the Greeks are forced to internal devaluation, lowering the salaries, Unfortunately, the prices are not going down. 

Also, while a budget deficit is not good, in the long run, it can certainly be argued for having one, for a few years, when the going gets tough, to stimulate the economy, keep people on their feet etc. Greece can't do that. Nor can they change the monetary policy in any way. 

To that, add humiliating treatment, and the demand of counterproductive measurements and you have a perfect storm. 

I am surprised you are blaming all of that on the Greeks, and frankly, I don't see how you can. 

For sure, the Greek politicians are corrupt  as fuck, the overspending was vast, the borrowing was out of control etc, and they most certainly needed to sanitate their economy, be yelled at and do true cut - backs, but that doesn't explain the whole crash, or everything that is happening now. 

Can't you see that a lot of the things that are happening in Greece is also happening in Spain? And *their* economy was doing if not great, at least fine. They were not overspending, paying off debt etc.  Sure, the housing boom, but that doesn't explain the total collapse, for years, and the unemployment numbers that are out of control. Also, can't you see that the real interest rate was too low for countries like Spain/Portugal/Greece, since their economy is so different from Germany?  Can't you also see that it is connected to the loss of competitivness, loss of monetary control, and internal devaluation? 

Otherwise, it is all *just* their fault, and I do not believe that.

That's still an understatement. They couldn't have done a better job even if they were on an intentional campaign to discredit their own industry even if they tried. My favorite example is how an operator of a thorium reactor thought a radiation leakage would be masked by that of the Chernobyl disaster that incidentally happened at the time, but there are several smaller examples where they tried to sweep malfunctions under the carpet.  
It's not just production, either. There's a storage site in a former salt mine where we went from ""totally safe, studies to the contrary are bullshit"" over ""oops, maybe not so safe after all, seems like we'd better get those barrels back out"" to ""well, we'll give our best but it's doubtful whether we'll manage that before it becomes structurally unstable"". Last I heard was that the main storage room wasn't where the plans said it would be when they did some exploratory drilling to have a look at it.

The point is, while nuclear energy is pretty damn safe in theory, this theory relies on operators sticking to regulations and procedures that would often mean their multi-billion euro investment can't produce while causes for problems are being investigated. It's a matter of trust, and this trust has been eroded long ago.

Now, personally, I believe a longer transition period would have been more sensible, mainly because I don't trust our current government to do a proper job particularly with the necessary modernization of the grid infrastructure and building of interim storage facilities, as well as reduction of consumption through better home insulation and general efficiency, and even if I did it would still be, let's say ""ambitious"" from a technological standpoint to do it within such a short time frame, but I agree with the switch to renewables in principle. 

Obviously, the increase in coal is *bad* and a testament to the government's mishandling of this (compared to the smoother plan to phase-out of nuclear power that had been decided a decade early but that they nixed just months before turning around after Fukushima). I consider Climate Change to be a bigger threat than nuclear accidents and problems with waste management, but I also expect that what the investment into renewables does for research, prices and a built-up of the supply chain does for wind and particularly solar, will more than balance it out globally.",0,1360329522,null,0,false,0,c8bjz6m,t3_1843vc,t1_c8bjz6m,t1_c8bjgr8,null,1431229776,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

You can also rent a Velib bike and use one to get between places that are closer together if your feet get sore from walking. You really can see a LOT if you just wander on a pre-determined route. 

You only have 3 days, don't spend most of it underground where you won't see anything, or waiting around for the next bus. Walk until you have blisters, that's the best part of a trip to Paris, IMO.

&gt;Human history is filled with folktales, and oftentimes similar tales appear in the record of different cultures. One of those is referred to as the ""kind and unkind girls"" tale. It's about two girls—one who is nice to everyone she meets and is eventually rewarded for it with gifts of gold—the other girl is mean and nasty and winds up being given a box of snakes. Historians have found many variations on this tale—in some it's two boys, in others its women of different classes. What remains the same is the moral. In this new study, the researchers sought to compare the way the story spread from one culture to another in Europe, as compared to the way cultures mingle and procreate.

&gt;In analyzing historic documents, the researchers found 700 variants of the tale from cultures across Europe as they existed over a hundred years ago—in 31 languages. They then compared genetic records of the people that currently live in those cultural areas with the different tale variants they'd found. In so doing, they found that people living in close proximity, but of different cultural backgrounds, were ten times as likely to produce children with one another as they were to take on the different version of the tale. This, the team suggests, shows that assimilation of cultural aspects, particularly if there are language differences involved, is much slower than the spread of genes across geographic areas.

&gt;The team notes that in Europe today, there are very few differences in the gene pools of different countries, indicating a very high degree of comingling. At the same time, most of the countries in Europe have managed to hold on to many of their cultural differences. This suggests they say, that cultural traits are less likely to cross borders, than are genes. But language differences aren't the only reason that culture doesn't travel—the researchers also found many instances of differing variants of the tale between people that lived close together and spoke the same language, indicating that there are other factors involved as well in some areas.",0,1360332715,null,0,false,0,c8bkjei,t3_184qby,t1_c8bkjei,t3_184qby,null,1431230067,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Those same countries, prior to joining the Euro, were compensating for their lack of competitiveness with periodic devaluations of their currencies, making their citizens comparatively poorer in the process.

Most certainly true that they got comparatively poorer, of course, and it was more expensive to borrow, as well, but they did have jobs, and they did have a chance to influence their own economy. 

I am not saying that is the only thing a country should do, but it is an option. Or, do like Sweden - we have a free floating currency, but a central bank that control the interest rate. That interest rate is set after Sweden's interest, not Germany's. And, particularely with countries with such a different economies, it can be really bad to share interest rate. 

&gt;Internal or external devaluations are just patches when a country is simply unable to undergo the deep reforms that are required to compete in today's global market.

No arguments there, I am sure they need to do deep reforms. But do you think those reforms are being helped with being in the Euro? 

Think of (former)DDR. They had deep structural problems and had to undergo deep reforms that were required to compete in today's global market - and they had to do it with the D-Mark. Fun you think. Well, the unemployment is still higher in former DDR, and West Germany has been pumping in bilions for over 20 years now - and they are still not as competitive. 

Well, no one, ever is going to pump in the billions to the DDR levels, for the next 20 years, in Greece, it is not politically feasible. Yet, a lot of countries expect them to somehow ""shape up"" and become international competitive, at once. How? 

I think they could become competitive fairly quickly - with their own currency. Look at Argentina. But, asking them to become competitive, while they are being in the Euro, and not pumping in wast amounts of money is just not feasible. 

Look at DDR. They still are less productive, have higher unemployment etc, and for the last 20 years the have *not* have to deal with foreign debt and they have their minimum standard of living paid by the federal government, as well as just billions in there every month, just to stimulate. Greece's get none of that, and yet we expect them to fix it, or are we just punishing them because they are bad?

[qui](http://rsaonline.arpa.piemonte.it/allegati/Files/fig06_07.jpg) si nota come la tendenza non sia certo al rialzo, anche negli anni pre crisi.

La linea storica aveva, prima degli ammordenamenti, una capacità di 20 milioni di tonnellate annue, e dal 2000 al 2010 solo 8-4 milioni di tonnellate hanno viaggiato su rotaia ogni anno (dato anche questo in discesa).

Con i recenti ampliamenti ([qui](http://fardiconto.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/i-container-nel-frejus-un-mito-post-moderno/) un riassunto) la capacità è aumentata, in particolare è da 2 anni possibile trasportare tir di qualsiasi tipo (standard) mentre prima l'altezza delle gallerie limitava la tipologia degli automezzi caricabili sui treni merci.

Insomma abbiamo tendenze in calo (principalmente perché i commerci con paesi al di là del valico sono stabilizzati, al contrario di quelli con l'europa dell'est: non a caso invece il traffico attraverso l'Austria è in forte aumento) e vogliamo spendere una cifra enorme (pari appunto a quella di cablare in fibra pressoché tutte le case degli italiani) per avere, fra 20 anni (se va bene), una linea ferroviaria che sarà ancora più sottoutilizzata dell'attuale.

The overfishing has certainly not stopped, but (in the 30 most common fishes) but has decreased from a level of 10 (I know, I know, madnes) to be more on a level of 2-3. Still way to much, but the decrease is significant. 

One of the reasons the EU has been able to do it for so long, is that fishing, while perhaps ""emotionally"" significant, it is not really of huge financial importance, not to the level of Iceland and other fishing nations. Thus, rather than take the argument, it has been easier to look away, throw some money after them and hope the problem goes away. 

This also means that the problem will not go away, a huge majority of the MEP's voted for it, and someone, somewhere, will have to start to listen. 

&gt;Or what? Heafty fines? Vessels loose the license to fish? The rule is meaningless otherwise.

I hope so, and also that it is equally implemented everywhere. I have no problem with jail time either.

We have sizable minorities of Germans that aren't native speakers of German, we share borders with countries where just about ten different languages are spoken, etc. If we switch to English *instantly*, then you're being obvious.

Americans tend to have a very strong accent. You get intonation wrong, you mispronounce umlauts, your R sounds like you're chewing gum, you put a visible effort into pronouncing CH, and so on. You also always try to smile as much as possible. All dead giveaways. :P

The only way you wouldn't have to ""worry about anything else"" is if you are working under a status that would exempt you from paying German tax (like TESA), or your employer has a tax equalization policy in which they pay your US and German taxes for you but charge you an amount that would equal your US tax burden.  In the latter case you are paying German taxes, so I don't think it would be a problem for eventual residency (but I'm hardly an expert on that).

Also; other advice for taking the metro around would be, pay attention to the signs that are on the walls of your stop. Some of the trains you get on, have light up stop signs. Which will indicate which stop you are at. BUT SOME DO NOT HAVE THAT! So when you are on a metro and not sure what stop you are at, just look outside to the walls when you have stopped, and there are big signs telling you which stop you are at. All metro stops give free maps out, walk up to one of the booths and just ask for one! it's great to have in case your offline metro app isn't working.

1 That sounds a little like hyperbole based on your position and personal political stance. It's very easy to sympathise with one group and see them as the under dog if you look purely from their perspective. Unless you'd like to provide some sources.

2 Did you hear about the MPs' expenses scandal? Or all of the MPs' expenses in a whole host of other countries abusing their benefits and salary systems? You can hear about them and know that people and the authorities know, yet they are not persecuted. corrupt expenses is by no means uncommon and it does not show a clear correlation between that and utopian dictatorships, ect.

3 Bad audits = dictatorship? Ok I'm taking you out of context there, but still. It's indicative of bad government and bad economics, not of being corrupt or potentially being corrupt in the future.

As for all the highlighted ""proposed"" and ""calling for"" bits, yeah the EU parliament proposes a whole load of bad ideas. Parliaments do that. 175 British MPs voted against the Gay Marriage bill. That seems pretty bad to me in a similar (though obviously not identical) way to MEPs **proposing** the suppression of eurosceptics. **MPs and MEPs** say a lot of crazy crap and a lot of it gets shouted down. The crazy eurohpiles in the EP are in the minority, though that minority is not as small as I would like.

However, that is not even the biggest reason why the EP having dictatorial tendencies is irrelevant. That reason would be because we have proper separation of powers and it will remain that way as our parliaments remain sovereign. The commission and the council of ministers tendencies are much less evident and consist of a let less dictatorial crazies. The EP is one of the weaker bodies in the EU as it cannot propose legislation and therefor relies on the more moderate EU bodies to propose it.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"&gt;That's exactly the distinction I just made, zero points for reading comprehension. Don't repeat it back to me like I didn't make it you silly little student.

Well if you understood that, then the most logical conclusion is that you're too stupid to understand that they achieve *different outcomes in different circumstances*, as, for example, in the difference between voting on legislation and voting in an election, which was my point and had nothing to do with historical meanings of the word, but rather what it meant in this specific example. 

&gt;Actually I have a quite a lot of education, but I also have real world experience which puts all the utopian clap trap about how politics and organisations really work in textbooks into perspective of how they work in reality, corruption and self-interest is massively more pronounced than academics usually like to admit. The politically left ones like to imagine it's all confined to the private sector, but this is simply laughable. While a 20-something or 30-something can have perfectly valid opinions, you don't get to write stupid waffle sentences like the one I quoted and reinterpret my writings.

All this tells me is that you've boiled down the idea of a 'student' to mean 'left leaning idealistic crowd thinker' and decided that's what I am. You have no idea how old I am, how long I've been studying for, and what kind of life or work experience I've had in the past, so how about you keep those ridiculous and petty remarks to yourself, sunshine.

&gt;Anyone who wants to have reps taking what they think ""best course of action"" and deliberately shielding them from democratic supervision has not quite yet realised that they have ceased to be democratic.

Yeah, way to boil shit down to the idealistic craptrap you accused me of spouting, instead of looking at how the world functions in reality. You talk of just 'democracy and its pros and cons', without realising that this is exactly one of those cons that has to exist in democracy, where representatives might have to shield how they voted to stop populist rhetoric pervading the place. 'Oh, wow, hiding the voting makes it so undemocratic!'. Guess what, in a democracy were kept out of the vast majority of what we should have access to as our democratic prerogative (everything that goes on within political parties for example), but we don't worry about that, because the machinery keeps functioning. Just as this secret ballot is supposed to do. Maybe this would mean we'd actually have a discussion about how we want our democracy to function, instead of shit just happening.",0,1360349483,null,0,1385663771,0,c8bpo4t,t3_184li1,t1_c8bpo4t,t1_c8bp0na,null,1431232537,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

Please don't try and act like you're intellectually superior to those who hold a different view to you.

I try to sympathise with your points of view and allow myself to be won other if I feel appropriate. I'd expect the same in return.

&gt;So why would I sign up for something worse that's going to get worse?

It looks like it can't get better from where *you*'re standing right now. However that doesn't unequivocally make it true. At the present moment I don't see the EU as a viable federation, but that doesn't mean it can't be in the future. It needs reforms and it needs a lot of them, however those reforms are within reach. The UK used to be a collection of kingdoms run by a minority for the minority and now the UK is one the most effective democracies in the world (when compared against the world, not against fellow westerners, I'll admit). Germany and France went through similar reformations, revolutions and evolutions. The EU should and will do the same. If the EU fails, that'll be sad but it could happen and if it does I'll still dream of European Unity through a different organisation and only if it is competent organisation which the EU is not **at the moment** however as it is a government with the ability to evolve and as there is obviously a desire amongst the general public for it to evolve, it will evolve and it will evolve to become more democratic and more open. The UK only got freedom of information in the last decade. We got that far without even using it. I'm not saying that's ideal, but I'm saying it's not as outlandish as you might think. I'm not proposing we join a federation with no freedom of information. I wont vote yes until that's in place, but just because it doesn't have freedom of information *yet* doesn't mean it wont in the future and that it wont become more competent in the future.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Taken to it's logical extreme, who can be relied on to provide reliable roads for everyone in the country at constant and regular prices everywhere? Can a 'self-made' magnate be trusted to do this? 

You're comparing roads which are a public good (as they're very hard to charge - and even so, there's highways with tolls and all that, so it's not that far-fetched to have privately-owned roads) with electric power which has none of those restraints and is often and without any issue held and developed privately.

&gt;As a Dutchman; poldering, for example, very rarely would a singular person decide ""hey, I will buy this lake, then I will get a shitload of mills, and then I'll have a lot of land!"" - it was a matter of government and how they raised their revenues with taxes and money lenders. (Though indeed the latter could well be private entrepeneurs.) 

If the society at large thinks they're getting their money's worth, fine, why should we oppose taxation for that?

Taxes aren't inherently evil, it's them that support the police that keep us safe, the courts that handle defence, the military which protect us against foreign threats, the firemen that can save our lives and our assets against fire and not only, and many other things.. the issue isn't taxes, is where you spend those.

If you spend taxes to provide goods and services which for whatever reason can't be provided by the market, sure, you'd be a fool not to.. but to subsidise every special interest group there is and use the taxpayers' money on developing and providing solar power which the private sector already does without any kind of problem on its own, no, that's ridiculous, that's a waste. It's not right to take money away from people which might need it much more urgently and to use that money doing things the people themselves already do on their own and would do better if they hadn't their money spent in their name on what the politicians choose.

You can copy paste the above sentence for African Americans: Most of them are splendid people except for a disenfranchised section that is going through problems for socioeconomic reasons they had no control over.

The only difference is that African Americans do not have a culture and/or a legal system that is competing with the American system. Muslims do have those, and it will never change. The question of Sharia will always be there as it is part of the Muslim faith to not change any part of the legal jurisdiction and to always implement it when possible.

Those who open grocery, kebab, shop, etc. all share the want to implement Sharia as part of their faith as it tells that they'd otherwise go to hell.

No, sorry, it wasn't. Poland was the smaller one geographically (at first), but it had a bigger population than Lithuania and was more advanced.

From Wikipedia:
&gt;Shortly after the Union of Lublin ( 1569 ), the Commonwealth population was around 7 million, with a rough breakdown of 4.5 m Poles, 0.75 m Lithuanians, 0.7 m/10% Jews and 2 m Ruthenians. In 1618, after the Truce of Deulino, the Commonwealth population increased together with its territory, reaching 11.5 million people, which was composed roughly of 4.5 m Poles, 3.5 m Ukrainians, 1.5 m Belarusians, 0.75 m Lithuanians, 0.75 m Old Prussians, 0.5 m Jews, and 0.5 m Livonians.

I have to specify that since 1569, [Poland was the bigger subject of the Commonwealth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Lublin). (Okay, technically not Poland, but ""The Crown"". Which was pretty much Poland-dominated.)

Warning though for places like Sainte-Chapelle, the line is awful.  You will have to wait in line to go through security because it's inside a government building/complex.  And with your limited time in Paris, I would plan to get there maybe 30 minutes before they open.  Get in line.  Then go do something like Notre Dame because it can get a line too, though I think it moves fairly fast.  No security to go through there, just a wait so that it's not overcrowded maybe.  But it's just a couple blocks away from Sainte-Chapelle (which is most definitely worth seeing... don't forget there's an upstairs once you go inside, some people don't realize that).

If you want a view, go to the top of the Arc de Triomphe and/or la Basilique du Sacre Coeur.  Both have awesome views, are cheaper I think, and typically no lines.  When I was there last spring, the Eiffel Tower line was 3 hours long.  The other two have lots of stairs to climb, but it doesn't take long and the views are great.

The individual view is, find the best individual for the job.

Like if you counterbalance prejudice with quotas, you actually end up with a level playing field for getting the best individuals.

My opinion: there is a certain logic in the collective logic, however any group level, systemic rebalancing changes **are not going to get the best individuals from that group, but more like the most politically connected**.

There has been a lot of revisionism going on here since the Prussian school dominated thought on the HRE for a long while. Then we had the Dortmund school and of course local historians looking at stuff.  

The history of the state of Prussia and WWII/ Hitler have also been casting their shadows on the interpretation of the HRE.  

Then there is the general revisiting of the feudal system that has been going on since the 90s. Shit is way to complicated. And all of this plays into the diea of why the Empire never solidified into something like Britain or France.

In some cultures it's highly offensive to even touch a person's head and people feel their personal space is violated if someone approached them more than 1 meters. In others where body contact is more desired it's quite normal to communicate with a smack to the arm or the back, knock on the head, pushing, shoving but also hugging and kissing. You can't make a universal law on violence because violence is perceived differently by people in different cultures. Similar to how the age of consent is different, in Sweden it's 15 while in the US it would be considered raping a minor.

I'm not saying beating up women is ok. I'm saying that, if people are temperamental and a heated argument happens and objects get thrown, people shouldn't automatically assume that anyone got (seriously) hurt.

true,arrrg,null,null,"It’s pretty unlikely that the searches and per capita GDP are so strongly associated by chance. Social scientists dream of such strong correlations (for 2010: r=0.78, p&lt;0.001) late at night – because usually those don’t exist in the field. It’s also not like they threw a bunch of stuff at R to see what sticks. They had a pretty clear plan with the two variables they looked at – and the association holds for several years they looked at.

Also, this is not about Germany. That’s a stupid way of framing it. That’s what the Guardian did, sure, but it’s wrong to focus so much on that. I would argue that the data is too messy to look at the positions of single countries (as evidenced by how rapidly single positions change over the years). It’s about a more general pattern. Again: The correlation is quite high. That’s what’s interesting.

I honestly see no issue with their method, but I would agree with you that including possible confounding variables and building a proper model is the logical next step. I would also argue that their conclusion is weak and not at all theory driven, so it kind of hangs there in the air, all alone, being lonely.

I like the aspect of “planning ahead” you picked up on. Maybe that’s an essential part of what they call “future orientation”? I would certainly argue that planning ahead is a big part of future orientation. A next step here would probably be surveys (or something like that) to get a better idea what those searches are actually for and then try to build some kind of theory from that and test it. (Or it might be possible to test this in a more automated way like they did here.)

One other problem here is that we know nothing about the causal direction. It could be that more “future orientation” (I still have a problem calling it that, but for brevity’s sake I will here – you know what is actually meant by it) leads to a higher GDP (personally, that seems absurd to me†), it could also be that a society with a higher per capita GDP and thus a higher development either allows people to think more about the future (instead of living from day to day) or, alternatively, is so competitive that planning ahead is more necessary than elsewhere. It could also be that those searches measure something completely different than “planning ahead” or “future orientation”, or it could be that some third variable positively influences both “future orientation” and per capita GDP – i.e. the two variables aren’t actually causally related at all.

We don’t know any of this – and finding out which of the interpretations is the right one would be an interesting project.

This is a starting point. It’s a very interesting result, but the actually interesting work – trying to find out why this association exists – has not been done yet. So much is clear.

(I’m at the moment working on something were we compare different countries and try to explain the framing in newspapers in those countries of renewable technologies. To that end I also looked at several possible variables describing countries and found that many are strongly correlated with each other, for example the Press Freedom Index, Human Development Index, per capita GDP, energy consumption, energy production and so on. It’s not my main interest now, plus it’s a different field, but investigating those sometimes surprising associations seems like something interesting to do. By the way: It’s also very cheap. For this kind of work it is literally not necessary to spend any money beyond the salary of those working on it, so nothing in the case of graduate students, next to nothing for research assistants or postdocs.)

† Which, by the way, means I’m disagreeing with them. Right in the headline of their paper – “Quantifying the Advantage of Looking Forward” – they give their interpretation of a causal direction from forward looking to economic advantage. That causal direction is in no way established by their work and I highly doubt that it’s the right interpretation.

The single market opened up large untapped markets to these businesses. Furthermore, combining currencies with weaker nations. As the Euro is a weaker currency (than the German mark or Dutch guilder) this has ensured that exporting is cheaper than usual. 

Then the Hartz reforms came in, and combined with the European Working Directive this has ensured that no other european countries can compete with German productivity levels without breaking EU laws.

Then, finally as the periphery of the EU has been sucked dry. So the Germans need to look for new exporting markets. That is why the idea of free-trade deals with the US have suddenly surfaced now.

What is wrong with you ?  I just said I do not pay a fucking dime in income taxes.  I do not get double taxed. I told the OP exactly that.  Where did I say I get double taxed ?  

Show it to me.  I said the exact fucking opposite.

Show me one false statement in my post. And if there was one then you should've pointed it out.

I don't see how my post deserves such ill mannered behavior.

Seriously, people are asking for advice here and all the advice I gave is 100% correct.

I DID just cut an $8000 check to the US for social security and I need to figure out how I can transfer that to a German equivalent or at least make sure I'm paying in to something here so I don't have to pay SS to the US.

Do you know anything about that ?  Do you know anything about transferring SS balances to German equivalents.  Do you have anything to contribute in the way of facts or do you just have snide crap about Fox/Solar to post ?

Do you think my reasonable concern about cutting $8k checks deserves ""big boy pants"" shit ?   Are you so big that you just pay money just because you are a big boy ?

Did you misread or are you replying to the wrong post ?

The huge difference for me is, that there are some people like politicians, nouveau riche etc. who wants an Phd to gather respect, need it for their career, or just have a low self-confidence and like to be called Herr Dr.... 

The other group are people who are really interested into their academical specialization and the Phd is just one of the steps you have to do sooner or lader to gather more knowledge.
If somebody would dare to doubt they cheated, they could recite every single sentence of their dissertation. Just because they spend countless nights thinking about them.

• Los nacidos en España de padres extranjeros, si ambos carecen de nacionalidad (apátridas), o si la legislación de ninguno de ellos atribuye al hijo una nacionalidad.

Schengen has nothing to do with taxes. But you pay taxes to the country you're working in, and probably some amount to the USA as well.

An EU national ID card is sufficient for travel to, from, and within the EU (not just Schengen). If you wanted, you could use that for Europe and your American passport for everywhere else.

In the 1980's, I moved here primarily because it would significantly increase my pay.  I did very little travelling, failed to learn the language, and pretty much ignored the history.  That was when I was in my early 20's.

This time is much different.  I moved here for several reasons: one being imminent layoff if I had stayed in the States, but also because I had discovered an excitement for European culture and history in general, and German culture and history specifically.  Even before I knew I would be moving here, I learned the language (not an easy thing for a 50-something monolingual living in a monolingual culture).

This time around, I've travelled extensively and have now hit 24 countries.  Wherever I go, I learn the history before going, avoid the tourist traps (as much as possible), stay in bed and breakfasts, and try to embed myself in local culture.

true,antonia90,CYPR,Cyprus,"In Cyprus, people tip usually in restaurants, it's not so common at hairdressers or places of that sort, but it does happen. The tip is usually 10-15%. You would probably be looked down upon if you don't tip, not because the waiters depend on tips to get payed (like in the states), but because cypriots are spenders and they like to show it. If you don't tip, it means that you're stingy.

I lived in the UK for 4 years and I found that there it's more common for people to not tip. There's an optional service charge of 10-15% included in some bills that most people pay, but I wouldn't be shocked if someone asked for it to be removed. Tipping for cabs or hairdressers is rare, except in cases where the client is really well-off or the service was exceptional. I've done it a few times in cabs, e.g. left the change or maybe a couple of pounds extra, depending on the price.

I live in Spain now, where I've never seen anyone tipping for a taxi and it has also happen to me a couple of times that the driver wouldn't accept the smaller coins (e.g. I had to pay 5.30 and they only got the 5 euros). In restaurants and cafes people usually leave the change, maybe a couple of euros more, depending on the bill.

These are all, of course, from my experience.

**Übergangsgeld**

Wer die Bundesregierung verlässt, fällt erst einmal weich. Bereits nach einem Tag Amtszeit stehen einem Bundesminister knapp 62.000 Euro Übergangsgeld zu. Je nach Dauer der Amtszeit kann das Übergangsgeld auf rund 186.000 Euro steigen, das maximal 2 Jahre nach Ausscheiden gewährt wird. Auch wenn die Übergangsgelder ab dem zweiten Monat mit privaten Einkünften verrechnet werden, bleiben sie ein üppiges Polster, wovon viele in der Privatwirtschaft nur träumen können.

**Ruhegehalt**

Besonders großzügig sind die Ruhegehaltsregelungen gefasst. Wer mindestens vier Jahre lang Bundesminister war, kann sich über eine Pension von rund 3.820 Euro pro Monat freuen. Mit jedem weiteren Jahr als Regierungsmitglied steigt die Pension um weitere 329 Euro monatlich bis maximal rund 9.880 Euro. Für Bundesminister gilt die gleiche Regelaltersgrenze wie für Bundesbeamte, also die schrittweise Anhebung auf 67. Doch können ehemalige Bundesminister unter Umständen schon mit 60 ihr Ruhegehalt in Anspruch nehmen.

It's true that Germany and many western EU countries used to be ahead in terms of infrastructure, but that was some time ago. I absolutely love the autobahn in Germany, but while a good road stays useful for years, if not decades, an internet connection has to be upgraded all the time.
Maybe it's a coincidence, but it seems like there is a rather consolidated monopoly for the physical connections in DE, and since the company that owns them doesn't really need to upgrade - they stay the same.

I admit I didn't investigate it further, but from my personal experience - having to wait 2-3 weeks for ""installing a connection"" (that is flipping a switch in a box in the building), the connection quality being abysmally bad (rarely reaching the speeds you paid for, bad ping, lost packets) and general lack of options (providers wouldn't offer you their services in a building/area ""serviced"" by another one, even though they technically could). 

All of this didn't make a positive impression at all - especially when I came to Berlin from Poland (that under-developed eastern neighbor where we fight polar bears for access to our PCs). What I thought was ""meh"" in terms of service quality in Poland, turned out to be an unattainable level of quality and price in Germany.

Not sure if it's any consolation, but now I'm in France and it's just as bad.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"Your assessment of tipping in Cyprus is mostly spot on. Usually what I noticed is that people in general will just leave the coins they received in change with some kind of comment like ""pfft.. coins.. just keep them"". I think the same sort of thing happens when settling a bill in a restaurant.. You get a bill for 36.90 or something like that, you put 40 euros there and just leave. Or Put a 50 euro note, wait for the change and take just the 10 euro note. Obviously the 100 or 200 euro notes come out if the waitress is really hot (or the 500 euro notes if the bill is big enough), and they hang around long enough to start a conversation with the waitress about how they may not need those worthless smaller notes (like that 10 euro note).

Cypriots just hate the coins because they can get very heavy, especially since they like to pay with notes (and they like to show that they are spenders, as you mentioned -- doesn't do much for their ""image"" if they go around buying stuff with coins.. unless it's something like buying cigarettes and the change is exact).

This effect has amplified since the euro came along because now you get coins in almost every transaction. Better to just not take the coins unless you wanna sit down and count all of it and work out how to get rid of it. There are a few [devices that sort the coins for you](http://i.imgur.com/Okh8kdd.jpg), but taking one of those bad boys out at the counter looks more retarded than efficient, and probably heavy enough that you need to wear a waist bag/fanny pack to carry it around.",0,1360421512,null,0,false,0,c8c5aqx,t3_186vxq,t1_c8c5aqx,t1_c8c4t41,null,1431240056,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"ahahahaha.. this is because until recently Cyprus didn't have a good enough bus system (but were forced to do something about it by the EU, I believe), so mostly people grew up thinking that if they don't have a ride somewhere, the taxi is the only solution.

The other thing could be the weather.. just too cold to walk outside in the morning while you're still waking up, especially if you wake up 20 minutes before the classes start.

Spending your parents' money is also very appealing to the younger cypriots. My girlfriend's sister is studying in Greece and told her parents that the classes end 2 weeks after when they actually do so she can spend 2 weeks on vacation when the university finishes. This thing eventually stops happening when they get a job and see what it's like to make 1000 euros and how quickly their ways make the money vanish.

Having *a* job isn't considered a requirement by a younger cypriot unless they start suffering or their family ties aren't too strong. This is generally quite a difficult thing to occur because family will take care of eachother. Although I guess some parents are probably stricter on their kids studying abroad and would tell them to get a job if they want extra spending money (but give them a good enough allowance anyway). Besides, the whole concept of sending them off to a decent university is for them to be able to get a good job and take care of them later on in life, so they'll put up with this shit knowing they might need a diaper changed later :D

p.s. also remember that in the summer over here it can become 40-45C with 85%+ humidity.. very unpleasant to walk for more than 10 minutes unless you're a tourist with the mindset of ""omfg.. this is gonna be a great 2 weeks!"". I've had a few situations where I was soaking wet in sweat within 1 minute of exiting the building. This sort of thing just sticks with you because your mind associates going somewhere in a car as comfortable and walking as being uncomfortable.

true,t_maia,SAAN,Sachsen-Anhalt,"If you are going Munich-Czech Republic and are travelling by train I would recommend the following route:

Munich-Passau-Sumava National Forest-Cesky Krumlov-Prague. 

No need to tell you about Cesky Krumlov, if you are going to Czech R. it will probably already be on your list of things to see and do. 

What you might not know is an unusual way of getting there - by public transport through the Sumava National Forest. It also happens to be the cheapest way to get to Prague from Munich by public transport, so very appealing if you are short of cash. 

You can either start from Passau or from Munich. If you are tight on cash, start in Munich. I would however recommend starting from Passau, it is a very very nice city to visit for a day. 

From Munich, buy Bayern-Ticket (Bavaria-Ticket). Shortly after 9 am take the local train from Munich to Passau. From there take the local bus to the stop **""Mühldorfer, Haidmühle""**. Haidmühle is a [small village near the Czech border](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=Haidm%C3%BChle&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=48.826051,13.782306&amp;spn=0.022377,0.038581&amp;sll=48.826136,13.777843&amp;sspn=0.022376,0.038581&amp;gl=de&amp;hnear=Haidm%C3%BChle,+Niederbayern,+Bayern&amp;t=m&amp;z=15) . bahn.de will tell you the schedule and the bus number. 

From this bus stop you walk about 20 min across the border to a tiny train station called Nove Udoli. From Nove Udoli you can then take the train to Cesky Krumlov. 

This journey is very scenic. Big advantage is the low ticket price and that you get to see the Sumava National Park as well as parts of the old Iron Curtain. Bayern-Ticket covers not just the trip to Passau, but also the bus ride up to the border. Especially if you are travelling with 2-5 people this makes for substantial savings. From Nove Udoli on you pay the low Czech national train fares, not the expensive international ones. 

The downside is that the trip takes some careful planning. The local bus is mainly used by schoolchildren to get from the villages to school in Passau in the morning and back to the villages in the afternoon. Because of this there aren't a lot of options for travelling to Haidmühle on the weekend and in the late morning. In addition you have to make sure that there is an ongoing connection from Nove Udoli to Cesky Krumlov. Careful check that this is the case. Especially if you start out after 9 am from Munich it can be tricky. 

bahn.de can help you with this. 

First part, search for connections from Passau (or Munich) by RE, RB and Bus to ""Mühldorfer, Haidmühle"". Bus should be local bus numer 6122. Write down arrival times. Add 20 min for walking to Nove Udoli. 

Second part, search for connections from Nove Udoli to Cesky Krumlov. 

There is also the option of taking the bus 6122 only to the stop ""Frauenberg Jugendherberge"", there is a youth hostel there. Then you can cross the border the next day, either [hike 7 kms](https://maps.google.de/maps?saddr=Frauenberg,+Haidm%C3%BChle&amp;daddr=48.795677,13.7573676+to:48.807201,13.7595069+to:Unbekannte+Stra%C3%9Fe&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=48.810481,13.777285&amp;spn=0.044767,0.077162&amp;sll=48.810707,13.775053&amp;sspn=0.044767,0.077162&amp;geocode=FUeA6AIdSf7RACnvMsoJcZR0RzGv5g9_Z9mz4g%3BFR2Q6AIdt-vRACkrNuk7ZZR0RzEgEVt5K9hJEQ%3BFSG96AIdEvTRACkn6I5mZ5R0RzEbTwi82C0_ZQ%3BFeMW6QId_H3SAA&amp;t=p&amp;gl=de&amp;dirflg=w&amp;mra=mrv&amp;via=1,2&amp;z=14) or take the 6122 bus. 

It might sound very complicated, but in reality it isn't. Plus, it is really worth it - you get to see the Sumava National Forest, Passau and the small Bavarian villages, which you would otherwise miss.

You are allowed to work on a student visa, but this is limited to 10-20 hours a week. With the average student job you will not make enough money to support yourself. 

Currently the immigration service asks that you have around 700 EUR a month for one person or 1250 EUR for a couple. So to get the visa for the inital year in Germany this means you will need to have around 20,000 USD in the bank for the two of you before they even consider issueing a visa.

It depends on the service though. 

Taxi drivers it's usually about €2.

Waiting staff averages at about €3-€5.

Hairdressers about €5.

Delivery people about €2.

Work Men between €5-€15.

And bar staff around €2 maybe twice in a night if they keep serving me quicker then other patrons.


They can all easily get nothing if they did a poor job. I resent giving it to hairdressers the most because I generally hate my hair cuts and only get it done like once a year and never by the same person, but it's what my family have always done and it seems expected.

I use the same taxi company all the time and they know me now and the service is exceptional. If i'm being dropped off to an empty area to meet someone they'll wait with me so i'll be safe till a friend arrives.

Not many people tip bar staff in Ireland unless it's a bus boy/girl which not many places have anymore. But if you do and the bar is packed later on more often than not they'll serve you quicker the next time and given how short I am it really helps.

So you shouldn't feel any special need to tip if you don't want to/can't afford it. But it's always a nice gesture if you get good service, especially. I don't like to make it a normal thing, because then it becomes a ""tip by default *unless* you receive particularly crap service"" sort of thing, but I don't believe that's how it should be.",0,1360428391,null,0,false,0,c8c6qns,t3_186vxq,t1_c8c6qns,t1_c8c601y,null,1431240737,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

Many experienced servers here in the US don't go out of their way to provide good service to European vacationers eating in their restaurant. The server knows that they will not receive a good tip (if at all) so they don't waste the effort. I must say I am speaking about normal restaurants.

You tip waiters this way, others just get a few bucks, delivery (food) people, taxi drivers, bartenders, valets, etc.

The reason we tip so much is that legally servers are not entitled to the same minimum wage as other jobs. For instance, standard minimum wage in my state of Illinois is $8.25/hour (highest in the country!) but for servers I think it's only about $2-3/hour. They *need* those tips in order to live. Supposedly, if they don't make enough in tips to hit ""real"" minimum wage their employer will pay them the rest. I'm a bit skeptical about that though.

I just realized that the waiters probably love me when I visit Europe o_o

Just found [this](http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm) on the Department of Labor site.

&gt; The main finding, based on data for 28 economies, is that the multipliers used in generating growth forecasts have been systematically too low since the start of the Great Recession, by 0.4 to 1.2, depending on the forecast source and the specifics of the estimation approach. Informal evidence suggests that the multipliers implicitly used to generate these forecasts are about 0.5. So actual multipliers may be higher, in the range of 0.9 to 1.7.

&gt; The report says the IMF believed that for every €100 of austerity through higher taxes and spending cuts, the effect on economic growth and unemployment would be the equivalent of €50.

But the biggest reason was the social effect, the opinion, right or wrong set in within the intelligentsia in the ottoman empire that they would lose in europe. this also weakened the leaders, who had traditionally used war to settle the masses down.

In addition, the fact they lost this land led to a chain reaction, as the atrocities against the balkans came to roost.

What I said was that cavalry charges don't cause the decline of Empires. The Ottoman Empire could have recuperated from its losses if the Battle occurred, say, 100 years earlier. The Ottomans recuperated from their naval losses at Lepanto, and it is much more difficult to build a new fleet than it is to raise new cavalry.

The loss at Vienna was hugely important, and definitely accelerated the loss of the Balkans, but even the loss of the Balkans would not necessarily mean the end of the Empire. Empires have lost larger territory and survived for centuries afterwards on many occasions - just ask the Eastern Romans. And, the Ottomans still held a significant portion of the Balkans until the 1800s.

To say that the Battle ""did cause the decline"" ignores the several long-term trends that were causing the Ottoman Empire to decline well before the battle ever took place. The Austrian/Polish army accelerated the decline of the Ottoman Empire, but they did not single-handedly cause the decline.

Under the Subheading 1a there's commitments for:

* EU research and innovation programme [Horizon 2020](http://ec.europa.eu/research/horizon2020/index_en.cfm?pg=h2020), got probably about €70 bn (was 80bn in Van Rompuy's proposal)

* New facility for energy, transport and digital infrastructure [Connecting Europe Facility](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/connecting-europe-facility), got €30 bn (was 50bn in proposal)

* Erasmus for all (Yay! Funding increased, I think by 31%? or 37%?)

* Satnav system Galileo, €6.3 bn

* Experimental fusion reactor ITER, €2.7 bn 

* The European Earth observation programme [Copernicus/GMES](http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=252993), €3.8 bn

* For decomissioning three old (sovjet-era) NPP's, €0.86 bn
