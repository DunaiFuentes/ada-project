""**In sintesi**, possiamo chiamare i quattro quinquenni che abbiamo analizzato in questo modo: il quinquennio 1991-1995 è il periodo della razionalizzazione, il secondo quinquennio degli anni novanta è quello dell’occasione mancata, in parte proprio per il successo della razionalizzazione precedente. Il primo quinquennio del nuovo secolo è il periodo della crescita esangue e della perdita di competitività e l’ultimo quinquennio, che purtroppo si prolunga anche negli anni successivi, il periodo della crisi.

Insistere sul modello basato sui bassi costi del lavoro per rilanciare l’economia italiana, come pure da più parti si è tentati di fare, non ci fa uscire dalla spirale bassi salari, scarsa innovazione, bassa crescita della produttività del lavoro. Quello che i fatti stilizzati ci dicono è che questi venti anni si sono aperti con una diminuzione dell’occupazione ed un incremento della produttività oraria del lavoro e si sono chiusi, di nuovo, con un calo delle ore lavorate, ma questa volta con una diminuzione della produttività del lavoro. Nel primo quinquennio l’aumento della produttività del lavoro è stato il risultato di un processo di ristrutturazione e di razionalizzazione dell’esistente. La condizione favorevole che si è creata non è stata sfruttata, soprattutto negli anni successivi, per rinnovare la nostra struttura produttiva. Di conseguenza, quando nella seconda parte del primo decennio del nuovo secolo scoppia la crisi, la struttura produttiva italiana è debole e non è possibile ricreare le condizioni dei primi anni del 1990. Occorre allora ripensare il nostro modello di sviluppo e specializzazione. Ma non è pensabile che il mercato da solo, per quanto si voglia renderlo più efficiente e liberalizzarlo e tantomeno se si insiste sulla flessibilità del mercato del lavoro, con conseguenti ulteriori effetti negativi sui salari,  crei gli incentivi sufficienti ad uscire dal circolo vizioso in cui siamo caduti.""",0,1387132028,null,0,false,0,ce2cq9s,t3_1sy1ld,t1_ce2cq9s,t3_1sy1ld,null,1428123058,6,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,6

&gt;""The tragedy of Africa is that **the African has not fully entered into history**. The African peasant, who for thousands of years have lived according to the seasons, whose life ideal was to be in harmony with nature, only knew the eternal renewal of time, rhythmed by the endless repetition of the same gestures and the same words.

&gt;In this imaginary world where everything starts over and over again there is no place for human adventure or for the idea of progress.

&gt;In this universe where nature commands all, man escapes from the anguish of history that torments modern man, but he rests immobile in the centre of a static order where everything seems to have been written beforehand.

&gt;This man (the traditional African) never launched himself towards the future. The idea never came to him to get out of this repetition and to invent his own destiny.

&gt;The problem of Africa, and allow a friend of Africa to say it, is to be found here. Africa’s challenge is to enter to a greater extent into history. To take from it the energy, the force, the desire, the willingness to listen and to espouse its own history.

&gt;Africa’s problem is to stop always repeating, always mulling over, to liberate itself from the myth of the eternal return. It is to realise that the golden age that Africa is forever recalling will not return because it has never existed.

&gt;Africa’s problem is that it lives the present too much in nostalgia for a lost childhood paradise.""

It's longer than that but that's the ""best"" bit. I also like:

&gt;""The weakness of Africa, which has known so many brilliant civilizations on its soil, was for a long time not being able to participate fully in this great cultural mix. [...] Youth of Africa, don’t listen to those who want to deprive you of your roots and of your identity, want to erase all that is African, all the mystique, the religiousness, the sensitivity, the African mentality. Because in order to exchange it is necessary to have something to give, to talk to others, it is necessary to have something to say to them.""

Looking at [Wiki's info on British citizenship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality) it does look like a bit of a mess. I presume that, while I would remain a British national (certainly) or citizen (maybe), the laws of the remaining UK would likely be changed to exclude those domiciled in Scotland from EU citizenship - I see other countries have done similar for dependant territories, and the UK already has those provisions for some places e.g. Isle of Man.

I'd presume that legally, the Scottish legal system and laws (assuming current legislation from the Scottish parliament would stay valid) have had to conform to EU requirements so there would not be a long time needed to correct those - after all, while Scotland would probably be 'new' to the EU officially, they've also been in it for a lengthy time.

Seriously though, this is yet another spectacular failure of a government so devoid of any original idea it has taken up time and again the rallying calls of the worse populists just to show they were doing something.

Earlier this year they abolished the property tax on private houses because Berlusconi had promised it during his electoral campaign, then they ended up re-introducing it under a different name because - big surprise - we couldn't afford that tax cut.

If you're a programmer or a research physicist, then you're going to benefit dramatically from knowing English, and being able to communicate in English as well. But where it appropriate to draw the line? For instance, with programming, a lot of the learning material which is available is in English, so should you have CS courses in English? Or maybe some courses in English, and some in the local language? But then you lose out in attracting international students. And then if you're running a software engineering company, are you going to talk in English? Or talk some of the time in English, and some in the local language? But then that means you can't bring in talent from abroad. And then the issue becomes less prominent with different subjects - physics to engineering to architecture to plumbing, etc.

You have to work out what the tipping points are, and where it's easiest to draw a line, and also work out ways of pushing the other way. Consolidation of languages might be one way, although it seems a bit difficult (and a bit artificial). Culturally, you could accomplish something similar by persuading people to watch tv and films in subtitles. That way, dramas like Borgen, Engrenages/Spiral, Wallander, Forbrydelsen etc don't have to sell just to the domestic audience. That's also why I was in favour of [the French getting a cultural opt-out from the American Free Trade deal](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/0614/Could-French-flicks-derail-a-US-EU-free-trade-pact).

The UK and France, two of the most powerful militaries in Europe, both [ran out of ammunition](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/sunday-review/what-libyas-lessons-mean-for-nato.html?pagewanted=all) fighting against Libya. This is after the US destroyed Libyan anti-aircraft capabilities. 

All NATO members voted for intervention in Libya, but only a few participated. Most espousing human rights concerns, but considering [71% of Libya's oil goes to Europe](http://www.eia.gov/countries/analysisbriefs/Libya/images/crude_oil_exports.png) I'd assume that was not truly the main concern. 

I only bring up oil exports because if European nations truly had a non-interventionist policy it is one thing. Considering *all* NATO members voted to intervene in Libya, its absurd to say they are non-interventionist. Also, the UK and France both decided intervention in Libya was necessary, and it appeared the US was going to sit Libya out. Instead of lobbying their European partners, the first thing the UK and France did was send high ranking officials to Washington to lobby for assistance. (I believe it was actually Sarkozy and Cameron IIRC).  

Libya was a European energy concern. It is in Europe's backyard, yet Europe still needed the US to do much of the grunt work.

Considering European powers ran into significant challenges fighting an enemy the US disarmed goes to show Europe is nowhere near the level of capability necessary to secure its own concerns. 

This even caused the outgoing US Secretary of Defense to question whether NATO membership is still worth it for the US. According to him the US is sick of being forced to take care of European concerns via NATO while many European partners contribute next to nothing (besides voting to expend the funds of other nations of course). 

I would say collective defense is inevitable if many European nations continue to rely on the US, British and French militaries for all their needs. Granted, I am sure France and the UK are sick of it as well, but it is much harder for them to take their ball and go home given their ties to Europe. If the US says 'fuck it' and stops supporting NATO nations outside of defending against an attack, I think it is inevitable a new European collective would have to emerge. Because, lets face it, many nations' capabilities are next to nil. And according to the voting records from NATO, European nations are nowhere near taking an non-interventionist policy. So the capability will have to come from somewhere.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think there are similarities are massive differences that contribute to the things you mention.

Firstly, corporate crony-ism and corruption. US is far from being the only one that experiences this. I would attribute the gravity of the two issues to US history and not due to the nature of the system. The US has always been ""freedom"" friendly, and their culture is specifically capitalistic,whilst europe is social-market orientated. I do think there is a risk of importing the same troubles with federalisation,but i do not think that the two will always come together.

Secondly, you're right that the smaller the population the better the quality of the democracy and better governed. However,you're judging this based on the US. The issue with government intrusion in US has been a conflict between state and federal level,and not an ideological conflict as its become now. Again,the two do not always comes together. You can have both.

The reason why US democracy is so bad right now it's because it was never intended to work this way. According to the US Constitution the States are those that are represented on the US level,and not the people.This is why you have the Senate and the Electoral College. The US has centralised far too many things at the Federal level, and this is why you have poor representation.Not to mention the awful First Past the Post system, the Electoral College , Gerrymandering, Distribution of seats in the US Congress. This issues are dealt with completely differently in the European states and there is no reason to believe that we will have the same system as the US.

Actually, I think we can have our cake and eat it too. I think that the general European electoral system does a very good job at being representative,unlike the US one. Furthermore,I think that having a federal system will also allow for places such as Scotland and Catalonia to leave their bigger countries and become smaller states,and be better governed.

There may be other issues with this,but I think it's important to look at each country by itself and its history. Cultural,social and economical relativism should always apply when trying to understand why a society is the way it is, and thinking that two countries are going to be inherently the same based on their size is a bit silly.Furthermore, there are types and types of federations. You cannot compare the federal us system with the swiss or german federal system. There are a lot of other issues with the comparison,but the devil is in the details and there's no reason why we would import the same problems.

1. Streaming is a gray area at best. This has never been fought out in a court. So it's **legal** *as long proven otherwise*. Some people claim that it's illegal as you create a copy of the data in the browser cache. This case is explicitly allowed under law which says that caching data is legal as long it's due to technical reasons.
2. They sent people through a proxy which resides behind the domain redtube.**net**. I guess they used SEO methods to get their website ranked high on google. The culprit is now that even *if this technique would be legal*, you can only track the people who went *through* the proxy, but not if they actually **watched** it.
3. There are claims by magazines that the movies they're saying the people watched can't match as the URLs to those are different to those the lawyer lists in his claims. **This makes the whole claim itself worthless**

They lost, as the judge said that porn is *highly primitive* and thus **not** protected under the curtain of copy right. (No idea about the § this went under, but it was ruled in Hamburg iirc)
5. There are also rumors which say that the court in cologne was knowingly fooled by the lawyer thinking those IPs were distributing copy-righted material. **This is not the case.**
6. The usual defense in Germany against such claims: The IP *does not* link to a specific person. It *may* be the case that e.g. the wifi of the subscriber was hacked. The subscriber is not responsible for this as long he can prove that he did everything to prevent something like this from happening.
7. ""Private copies"" are allowed under German law. Usually people get a notice for *distributing * copy-righted material **not** for downloading!

**If you get a notice by U+C, then DO NOT pay. Instead, force them to hand out all data they have recorded about you, which they must abide to due to §34 BDSG - They must offer this service for free to you.** If enough people would do this we could drain that company out of money and time. They're trying to make an example of us. Let's be nice and do the same to them.

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"The reason for the low level of English fluency in Spain are many, and some of them are shared with other countries with similar situations regarding the level of English (like Italy and France). I'm going to try briefly explain the main couple of reasons.

* Yes, English is taught as a mandatory subject since primary school. However, the level is very, very basic and the exigencies very low. It is not progressive: basically the same basic things are taught both in primary and secondary school, and as a result the understanding of English by the students is hardly a bit more than some common words and expressions. Poor approach to English by the public education system.

* Spaniards are massive consumers of Spanish-language media. All the films that get released here are **always** dubbed to Spanish. Al-way-s. Very few theaters will offer films in English (or any other language) with Spanish subtitles, because the demand is very very low. Every piece of media that comes to Spain has to be dubbed or translated to Spanish for it to be widespread, with the obvious exception of music. Film home releases (DVDs, Blu-Rays) always come dubbed in Spanish and that is the *default* setting. Some plans proposed by some entities to introduce films actually in English have failed multiple times.

* Why do the Spaniards have difficulties learning/speaking in English in school and later in life and consuming products in English? Well, it has nothing to do with the ability to learn or not more languages (big porcetages of the population are already bilingual, mostly in Catalan/Valencian but also Basque and Galician). It has to do with the **world status** of the Spanish language itself. There is such a huge amount of Spanish speakers in the world (420 million native speakers, just behind Mandarin) that most (if not all) products released have a Spanish version. It is profitable to dub all films, and translate everything, because the market is very very big. So, as long as they do not plan to live overseas, the Spaniards have really not strong motivation (or need) to learn another language, because everything is available in Spanish already. 

All this being said, most people *are* aware of the poor national level of English, and there are thousands of students learning English in both public and private academies. But, unless they travel somewhere else, the results end up being similar, because people don't see the need to use Spanish at all here (even with all the tourism!).

What is being done here, however, and on facebook, internet forums etc., is paint a doomsday scenario where the SPD bought into a coalition with the devilish CDU which will no less destroy the party. That's a load of rubbish.

It's a solid government that will bring some improvements and fall short of making any grand decisions. Not great but okay. The SPD didn't betray anyone, they made the right play with the cards they had on their hand.

&gt;Why does a 3rd generation ""immigrant"" need the citizenship of the country where his/her parents came from? This causes more problems than it solves.

The countries who are much better at immigration policy and instilling positive cultural identification than Germany all allow it. Enforcing single citizenship is but an ill-fated attempt at showing cultural dominance. The only way is to reconcile the two identities **in positive ways**.

The actual root of the problem is the fact that appearance is still the primary factor of identification in Germany (and most of Europe). You don't choose to be a Turk, you're being called one because of your name and looks.

You're not saying Albanians should be hated, but you wouldn't mind if they were...right? Be honest. ;) Reddit is on your side - clearly.

**Bamberg:**

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  

* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.

* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the [""Alte Hofhaltung""](http://www.emiksch.de/Lions/2007/Bilder/slides/Bamberg_Alte_Hofhaltung.jpg) where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)

* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""

* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above

* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.

* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.

* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.spezial-keller.de/index_files/stacks_image_44.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.

* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.

* Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

* Bamberg is a University Town with currently about 12k Students (at 70k people), so you'll find young people everywhere.

* Also close to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recommend ""Schäuferla"" :)

* ADIDAS and PUMA have their headquarters and big outlet shopping centres in the small town of Herzogenaurach, 45 km south of Bamberg. If you want to go shopping for cheap sportswear (and more), you should consider a visit. Also if you are interested in [modern](http://www.vb.com/puma/puma-hq-herzogenaurach-m.jpg) [architecture](http://www.herzogenaurach.de/typo3temp/pics/e9cc906d7d.jpg).

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live (0,5 litre of beer: beginning at 1,50€), and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car, but there are is a list of [bus lines](http://vgn.de/freizeitlinien/) (german link) that are esp. for recreational/free time destinations like wildlife parks or hiking from may 1st till november. Click ""herunterladen (PDF)"" to download a pdf with a map and images to see what to expect and maybe use google translate (google translate did not work on the homepage when I tried it, so i recommend the pdf ""workaround""). Here is a [map of the region with public transport lines](http://www.vgn.de/ib/site/documents/media/f387bb36-6624-65dd-c17b-5cde6c7b84f4.jpg/VG_Freizeit_Prospekt.jpg) that are interesting for tourists, green are regular routes, purple routes are weekend and holiday only and only in the summer while orange are weekend only during the whole year. If you need help to find the right trip, message me and I'll translate and help you to find the busses etc.

* [Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremberg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle (well, actually two castles) there and live there. 

* [Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.

* The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.

* At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.


**Traditional Food** you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

**Breweries I would recommend, although all are great:**

* Brauerei Wagner in Merkendorf
* Brauerei Goldener Löwe in Buttenheim (where the Levi Strauss museum is)
* Schlenkerla in Bamberg (The Rauchbier - that means Smoked beer- is a famous speciality, tastes like bacon) 
* Fässla in Bamberg
* Grasser in Huppendorf
* Klosterbrauerei in Weissenohe (founded 1050, one of the oldest breweries in germany, great food also!)

(Typical beer types in the region are ""helles"" and ""dunkles"", but also ""Märzen"" or ""Bockbier"") ",0,1387147096,null,0,false,0,ce2jmov,t3_1svfw1,t1_ce2jmov,t1_ce1tsfc,null,1428118374,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

I've seen the graph. So ""we"" refers to (some) Europeans, I suppose. Ok. But again, I guess you refer to the ""European race"" (if such a thing even exists) because, as I'm sure you know, the decreasing of births of a population is normally solved (besides of local pro-natalist policies) by allowing a necessary influx of immigrants (usually young people) getting into the country and reproducing. That's the reason the population of Spain, for example, has continued to grow despite having the lowest local birth rates in centuries. 

&gt;Why should I if it's pointless eitherway?

If you're not going to present your points and argue, then stop telling people who ARE giving arguments to shut up. In any case, you shut up until you decide to present your arguments.

Also, why isn't anyone taking responsibility for the Syrians, since we obviously fail at offering them what they need? If we're so bad with them, why not take them to your country?

Si on interdit les concours de miss, je propose également l'interdiction des danses sexistes pour les mineurs, comme le zouk et la danse du ventre, qui ne sont que le simulacre d'une domination masculine sur la femme-esclave. D'ailleurs quelle différence avec les autres danses ? C'est vrai quoi, le tutu, c'est un affreux symbole de sexisme misogyne hyper-genré et hyper-sexualisant !

Avec les mêmes arguments il faudra également interdire le maquillage pour enfants, et pénaliser les parents qui osent maquiller leurs enfants.

La vérité biologique, c'est qu'un mâle peut féconder plusieurs femelles en même temps, et pendant quasiment toute sa vie. L'inverse n'étant pas possible (grossesse, ménopause, règles). Du coup, compétition sexuelle et ""utilité"" différente : un homme dominé est moins utile qu'une femme dominée. 

D'ailleurs, [il naît 105 hommes pour 100 femmes](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/detail.asp?ref_id=bilan-demo&amp;reg_id=0&amp;page=donnees-detaillees/bilan-demo/pop_age2b.htm). À 23/24 ans, on se retrouve à l'équilibre. À 55 ans (âge moyen d'un député en début de mandat), plus que 94,5 hommes pour 100 femmes. Si les statistiques de mortalité montrent quelque chose, c'est une écrasante **injustice envers les hommes**, allant de pair avec une compétition plus féroce entre hommes.

Tout ceci se traduit dans les chiffres : [10% des femmes n'ont pas eu d'enfants contre 14% des hommes](http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/docs_ffc/ref/fporsoc06g.pdf) (femmes de 46 à 54 ans et hommes âgés de 48 à 56 ans), le phénomène étant aggravé quand tu comptes les individus morts vu que la mortalité est plus importante chez les hommes. 

Parmi les hommes, ceux qui sont dominés ont encore moins de chances d'avoir un enfant (17% pour les ouvriers). Parmi les femmes, ce sont les cadres et diplômées qui en ont moins, mais on peut croire que ce comportement est en partie désiré, alors qu'il semblerait être subi pour les hommes.

As I was saying above, export controls always kick in when prices get out of control. So when prices increase typically they go up more in Europe than North America. Delivery costs coupled with export controls can add a significant variance between two locations. So although I agree oil is a global market, it is fragmented, and it becomes more fragmented as prices go up. Countries with oil tend to feel the pinch less than those without.

When did these allegations of organ harvesting abductions occur? Before Serbs committed genocide or after Serbs committed genocide? 
I'll give you a hint - after. It was smear campaign to justify what Serbs did - exactly what YOU are doing now. Pointing finger without evidence. 

Here is link ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunt:_Me_and_the_War_Criminals ) from Wikipedia that boils down to following: 

- According to the Del Ponte's book the prosecutor's office received information from UNMIK officials who had in turn received it from ""a team of trustworthy journalists"" that some 300 kidnapped Serbians were taken
- A spokeswoman for the UN War Crimes Tribunal says that during a preliminary investigation in cooperation with Albania and UNMIK ""no reliable evidence had been obtained to substantiate the allegations.""

- The Swiss government has barred Del Ponte from promoting her book.[citation needed] It has been criticized for tarnishing the country's celebrated neutrality, particularly as Del Ponte has been named as the Swiss ambassador to Argentina

- Nekibe Kelmendi, Kosovo's Minister of Justice said Del Ponte's allegations “are pure fabrications made by Del Ponte or perhaps Serbia herself”. “If she knew of such cases then she should be charged with withholding evidence and hiding these crimes,” Kelmendi said.[6]
Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms has announced they will sue Del Ponte for publishing lies in her book

Here is link from that's showing another site where bodies of Albanians and Bosniaks were disposed. This time in BOSNIA. 
That means that bodies of those Albanians were driven across Montenegro, your country, to be dumped in artificial lake in Bosnia.

They might die in an accident and ruin your life because according to some people you don't get over the death of your child.

true,ruskyandrei,EURO,Romanian living in the UK,"To me it's just a step towards further integration not just for Europe, but the whole world.

It may sound idealistic, and it may very well be, but without dreams and ideals to guide us we would never progress.

It is certainly true that the fewer people a government has to govern, the less bureaucracy / corruption / abuse of power there will be. However, we (and by we, I mean humans as a species) will never really progress further if we keep to living in little independent, self governing groups.

This is because progress does not come cheap, and it often requires the resources and collective brilliance of many of us to achieve.

Ideological ranting aside, it can all be boiled down to a simple fact: Together we stand, divided we fall.
And now, more than ever, is a time when Europe can push for more and more integration. Never before have the cultures of all people on this continent been more alike.
There are still differences certainly. But due to many factors, culture across Europe is more similar than it has ever been, language barriers are not as strong as they used to be and the younger generations can grow up to see themselves as European above all else, which may, perhaps, eventually pave the way for the ""ever closer union"" some have been hoping for for a long time.

If the EU has issues as an institution than it is up to us to do our best to fix them, and I hope and believe that we can, even where others do not see it this way today. Perhaps it will not happen this generation but if we can keep it all from falling apart for now, it WILL happen.

Ultimately, a united Europe could mean a lot to the rest of the world as well. Here is this historically divided continent with perhaps that largest conflict / sq km ratio in the world, with arguably the greatest diversity in culture in the world, succeeding in working together and emerging stronger for it. If it can be done here than it can be done anywhere else in the world. 

I'm sorry I ranted a bit, and I probably didn't contribute much fact to the conversation, but you asked why I support further European integration, so this is why.

*""Die Zuschauer/innen, die das ZDF wegen der Stadtwette in Schutz genommen haben, haben gefragt, ob jetzt etwa auch schwarz geschminkte Sternsinger rassistisch wären, [...]?. Die Antwort ist: Ja, das ist rassistisch [...]. Denn das, was die fortgesetzte Praxis des Blackface zeigt, ist, dass die schwarzen Menschen in Deutschland, die ganz ohne schwarze Schminke den König Balthasar, den Othello und von mir aus auch den Jim Knopf darstellen könnten, schlicht nicht wahrgenommen werden.""*

An interesting statement, which I have personally experienced to be wrong.

I have participated in Sternsingen where black children participated as Kaspar (they were not restricted to it, but they wanted to have that role).

But, demographics in Germany being what they are, there was not a big enough number of black kids to fill these roles, so we also had painted white kids for them. And no one, not the black children, nor their parents, nor anyone I met in the course of this event over all those years ever thought it could be racist.

The only thing were Kaspar differs from the other roles is his colour.

""*Jedes Mal, wenn ein schwarzgeschminkter Weißer irgendwo auftritt, sagt das: Schwarze können das nicht. Schwarze kennen wir nicht. Schwarze gibt es in unserer Mitte nicht. Was Schwarze von dieser Rolle halten würden, wenn es sie in unserer Mitte gäbe, interessiert uns nicht.""*

...



*""So hätte also eine gute Stadtwette ausgesehen:*

*JIM: Hallo Augsburg, wir brauchen euch. Markus Lanz wettet, dass Augsburg es nicht schafft, fünfundzwanzig Paare als Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivführer hier auf die Bühne zu bringen.*

*LUKAS: Jim muss natürlich von einem schwarzen Menschen dargestellt werden – schwarz geschminkte Weiße werden nicht ins Studio gelassen, denn das Blackface gehört einer rassistischen Vergangenheit an, die wir auch jetzt schon nicht wieder gut machen können.*

*Diese Saalwette hätte Lanz vermutlich gewonnen, denn selbst diejenigen weißen Augsburger/innen, die schwarze Augsburger/innen unter ihren Bekannten haben, hätten vielleicht zu ihrem Erstaunen festgestellt, dass die mit der Figur des Jim Knopf nicht dieselben kolonial verklärten Erinnerungen verbinden, wie sie selbst.""*

Or the bet would simply have been lost because there were demographically not enough black people among those ready to participate. Which could be fully attested to be either the fault of the blogger for making the demand or the black people because they needed to volunteer at a several times higher percentage and didn't.

I'd like to see him choose there.

Apart from that, the altered bet sound incredibly tender.

In economically less developed societies, having many children is usually a good idea. You need someone to look after you when you're old, you need them to help on the field, and usually infant mortality rates are higher, too. In rich societies, people have less children, and they try to make it count. When their economic situation is insecure, people tend to delay the decision to have children. You can clearly see in the graph how the birth rate in (especially East) Germany dropped after unemployment went through the roof in wake of the Reunification. It just wasn't a good time to have children.

true,NSA_Approved,EURO,Citizen of the Galaxy,"&gt; The American dream -- the notion of equal opportunity for all, the chance to pull yourself up by your boot straps and make something of yourself -- is gone.

Gone? Either you're looking at the past with gold-coloured glasses or you're smoking something. ""Equal opportunity for all"" is something that never existed, doesn't exist and probably will not exist in the foreseeable future anywhere in the world.

&gt; Our education system is static and falling behind other advanced countries -- an economic time bomb -- whereas Finland is an educational superpower, the best in the west, according to the PISA studies of 470,000 15-year-old students from 65 countries [...]

If it's any consolation, we're also going down. And we were never that good to begin with. If the Finnish education system really is among the best in the world, it's not a testament to how good the Finnish system is, but just how horrible other places are in this respect.

Finnish education system sucks, has sucked for quite a while and will probably suck even more in the future.

&gt; The problem going forward is we live in a global economy and international companies don't care where they find educated people to hire.

Why would this be a problem for the USA, as long as educated people flock there from other countries? It's only a problem if the opposite starts happening -- ie. the educated Americans leaving for other countries -- and at least I haven't heard any signs of this being the case, nor do I consider it likely in the near future.

&gt; A century later, in 2009, the nation that gave us Nokia was the first to enshrine internet broadband as a fundamental human right. The government promised every Finnish citizen access to a 100mbps high speed connection by 2015.

Yeah, that's some pretty words there, but in practise this means nothing and especially the latter part about 100Mbps connections being available everywhere is a joke. Sure, they might be *available*, but does it really matter when the costs are so prohibitive that no one actually gets such a connection (outside of citites, that is, where you can already have faster than 100Mbps connections for a reasonable price).

&gt; Inequality is destroying the human wealth of our nation and is tearing the social fabric apart. And the clear consequences will be, and already are, a declining economic dynamism, life expentacy, national health, national happiness, for both rich and poor alike.

This is just my take on the subject, but I think we're just behind the times as usual and the same thing will happen in Finland as well -- unless some major changes happen and that doesn't seem likely in the current political climate. In some ways this has already started long ago (for example the economic inequality has been on the rise in Finland since 90's and at times it has been significantly faster than in most parts of the West).",0,1387173579,null,0,false,0,ce2umap,t3_1syf0l,t1_ce2umap,t3_1syf0l,null,1428113072,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

""falls to zero"" as in right this day it is, over 10 or 15 years it's still a lot higher, and could easier bounce back to more tomorrow. Meanwhile there's are a millions of them already in America and with high birth rates, plus all of the illegals(which none of these statistics are counting and estimated at more than 10 million total Latinos, presumably some Mexican). But yeah, sure the Mexican population isn't rising at all.

&gt;Once again they are on the same pace as past immigrant populations when it comes to language

Well there's just a flat out lie. All of the immigrant groups back then had to learn English or they would be entirely fucked. Do you think every radio back then had it's own Italian, Russian, and Polish station?

&gt; Not to mention that the same shit was being said about the Italians and the Irish and would you look at that they are integrated and are not causing any problems

Uh, no the difference is that they were actually treated like shit, not just have someone on the internet saying they should go home, and they still tried to integrate. Today the Mexicans don't care to adapt to many American customs, and they're given welfare and political clout, communicated with in their own language, and anyone who opposes them is called racist.

I know it's intentional, I just disagree with it being a good thing. Now the Senate can hold the overwhelming majority hostage, because you can get a majority in the Senate by having, what, 25% of the popular vote?


&gt; Of course they have a say. ""Reliably Democratic"" or ""reliably Republican"" states generally vote for the predictable party, but not always. Swing states are the most important, but if predictable support collapses because of an unexciting (or outright bad) candidate, then states can flip. Many if not most states have strong opposition parties, especially in national elections. For example, Massachusetts might be a ""reliable blue state,"" but we've had a few Republican governors and senators in recent history, and if the Democratic candidate is a lame duck, the Republicans stand a good chance to win.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;It has been discussed numerous times around here and the more popular opinion is to make English the official language

Official *second* language, typically. As it already is in practice.

&gt;ignoring that the UK vastly benefits from such an option

It wouldn't benefit the UK that much, because the UK is *already* complaining that the EU institutions use English in ways they would consider wrong. EU English already is getting characteristics of its own.

&gt;The popular argument is that practically everyone in the world and especially in Europe speaks it fluently (they don't)

But far more then any other language.

&gt; it is easy to learn (it isn't)

But many people have a head start and familiarity, and practice material is widely available.

&gt;and it is spoken around the world (as if French, Spanish and Portuguese wouldn't satisfy those criteria as well.)

Portuguese is mostly one country, Spanish is mostly one continent, and most French speakers are in Europe anyway. English has large and important countries *and* is spoken more widely as a second language than any of these.

&gt;The obvious explanation for this opinion is the bias of any person around here: Everyone here is fluent in English and consumes the majority of their entertainment and info in English.

That's the point, really: most people do. It's the path of least resistance.

&gt;The alternative, having people learn an artificial language like Esperanto, is ridiculed. Why not Klingon, Hungarian, Chinese? Because the latter are ridiculously hard to learn and the first and last do not have cultural roots in Europe. Esperanto was invented in the 19th century as a solution to the problem of having so many languages on such a small continent, providing a simple to learn lingua franca while allowing any smaller culture to retain their native language.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;It then follows that possibly one of the reasons why European governments tend to be of a better quality (not universally true, but on the whole I think it is) is that governments are smaller. Not smaller in terms of being lean and delegating responsibilities to the private sector, but small in terms of how many people they govern. This led me to think that were Europe to become more integrated, into something closer resembling a state, then there is the possibility that we could suffer from the same issue as America, in other words - many problems with the political system but too overgrown and massive to change.

We have the theoretical framework to prevent that: the subsidiarity principle, which dictates that policies should be determined in the lowest and smallest polity possible. Of course, it's always a judgment call where exactly that is.
Another difference is the preference for proportional representation and coalition governments rather than winner-takes-it-all voting. This allows political change to happen more gradually, instead of one-issue movements having to hijack one of the two big center parties to get their issue implemented.

Non, je ne dis pas ça.

Certaines femmes sont dominées, certaines sont dominantes, et certains hommes sont dominés. Il y a mille raisons. Hors **comme un homme dominé a une valeur sociale très faible**, il a tendance à tout faire pour se retrouver dans la position dominante, quitte à mourir. La valeur sociale d'une femme dominée est supérieure à celle d'un homme dominé. Il n'y a donc pas de patriarcat, qui sous-entend la domination systématique de toutes les femmes.

&gt;les hommes eux ont tendance à développer une domination, pour le même but

Les hommes dominés ont 5 fois plus de chances de ne pas se reproduire et d'être seul que les hommes dominants. Ils ont donc une motivation à vouloir dominer bien plus grande que les femmes dominées.

En résumé, il vaut mieux être une femme dominée qu'un homme dominé, donc pas de patriarcat.

Rapport direct? Aucun.

Il y a un état de fait biologique, très prononcé il y a des centaines d'années. Les musulmans pensent avoir trouvé la parade par la polygamie. Nous trouvons cette pratique d'un autre âge et dégradante pour la femme. Néanmoins, ta réflexion sur la cause de cette dégradation est toujours d'actualité. D'où ma réflexion...Je ne sais si je je suis claire...


&gt;2. Il y a de fait une polygynie des hommes des classes supérieures qui ....

La polygamie c'est pas divorcer et changer de femme, c'est en avoir plusieurs sous le coude sinon c'est pas fun :) 

Ensuite, j'ai envie de citer Coluche: ""Il vaut mieux être riche, jeune et en bonne santé que pauvre et malade""... 

&gt;Divorcer, pour un cadre, c'est avoir la possibilité de se remarier avec une autre femme tout en voyant ses enfants de temps en temps. Pour un ouvrier, c'est ne plus jamais voir ses enfants et finir seul. Chez les femmes CSP+, divorcer, c'est toucher une pension et garder les enfants et le patrimoine, tandis que chez les ouvrières, c'est se retrouver dans une merde financière.

Pourquoi à ton avis? (*j'ai pas le temps ce matin de lire tout le pdf que tu as gentillement partagé*). La loi est la même pour tout le monde non?

true,modulus,EURO,European Union,"First, I don't think size correlates to corruption or to bad levels of representation. In fact, a large polity can oppose private interests more easily than a small one. If a tiny country gets a company saying ""I want you to let me do X, Y and Z and I'll employ so and so many people"", the country will be more pressed the smaller it is to accept. If you want an actual example of this, EU consumer, environmental and safety regulation on products has led to companies modifying their practices abroad to sell to the common market, in some cases even to having 2 different production chains, one for EU goods and the other for the rest of the world. You think, say, Belgium, or even something the size of Italy or Poland could make that happen?

Second, the public sector is important and does good things, but there's inevitable administrative work that goes with it (true for private bureaucracies too). However, this work scales sublinearly to the size of the served population. Having two city councils serving 100k people each is going to take more people than a single one serving 200k people. So there's a certain economy of scale in terms of bureaucracy, and this is fairly obvious in the relative size of the EU civil service (tiny).

Third, I'm not attached to some piece of land, or even some shared history or language or culture. I personally have benefited from living all over Europe, and the fewer snags and obstacles for me to move around, the better. Some of those obstacles are also causing or will cause terrible problems. For example internal migration in Europe is going to cause huge issues with pension systems of countries where unemployment is high so the young leave but retired people stay, with increasing liabilities and decreasing working people to pay them. Unifying the social security and pension system across Europe would give us a bigger risk pool, a more resilient funding source, and would get rid of a lot of this sort of problem.

What I'm getting at is that regardless of the adjectives we use (valid, good, effective), you clearly think one form of protest is more [whathaveyou] than the other (the kind that I happen to consider less desirable in the sense that it's anchored in the more primitive and societally-regressive attitudes like xenophobia), when aside from these moral implications, both have been equally unsuccesful in achieving their goals?

true,Logothetes,GREE,Greece,"I do not agree. 

With Jews, religion is indeed tied with ethnic identity. Some Canaanite/Syro-Palestinians became ""*Jews*"" by following a particular religion. In other words, their identity and their religion necessarily went hand in hand.

But depending on your understanding of the term ""*Greeks*"" (""*Ἕλληνες*""?), Greek ""*tribes*""/city-states were ""*Greek*"" well before Christianity (some even say that with Christianity they stopped being Greeks (""*Ἕλληνες*"") in anything but language. 

So, either Homer, Pythagoras, Leonidas, Pericles Plato and Aristotle for example weren't ""*Greek*"" or to be Greek is ***not*** necessarily to be Greek Orthodox. Are the modern day followers of [Olypianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenism_%28religion%29) not ""*Greek*"" for example? They would seem to be even more Greek than the followers of ""*Christianity*"" (a personality-cult heresy of a primitive SyroPalestinian worship, which some Roman emperors took and imposed on everybody, making it thus the dominant religion).

The only thing that could possibly be argued (at the limit, and *Political-Correctness* notwithstanding) is that *to be Greek is not to be Muslim*. Some Muslims in Greece  can sometimes have a peculiar attitude that could easily be described as ""*anti-Greek*"", especially if they think they are talking to another fellow Muslim. It seems that they may even pine for Islamic/Turkish occupation again.

So I guess that, though this is not always the case or necessarily so, compared to ""*Greek Orthodox Christians*"" one could conceivably generally and prejudicially qualify them as *not-quite-as-""Greek""* so to speak. 

But even in that case, Islam would be the only religion in the way of being ""*Greek*"". And this is due to the very peculiar history of the Muslims in the Balkans. All Muslims in the Balkans had previously been Christians. But they converted to Islam during Ottoman occupation (often for lower taxes and generally better treatment). And since liberation from the Turkish yoke they haven't known quite where they belonged. And they were looked down by by the Christian population (for having denied Christianity and switched religion in order to please their Ottoman occupier), any feeling of alienation made worse by being made to feel ashamed for being Muslim. This can easily explain any ""*anti-Greek*"" feelings of resentment.

In conclusion, to be Greek is not necessarily to be an Orthodox Christian. Among my acquaintances and friends for example most are Atheists, a friend of my father (who had fought for Greece against both the Italians and the Germans) was a ""*Greek Catholic*"" and I can count more than a couple ""*Greek-Buddhists*"", at least one ""*Greeks Jew*"" and a surprising many ""*New-age-Greeks*"".  

And beyond that, the use of term ""*Greek*"" is a very complex matter: 

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_Greeks): 

&gt;""*When the Romans first encountered Greek colonists in southern Italy, they used the name Graeci for the colonists and then for all Greeks; this became the root of all relevant terms in European languages. (...) By Late Antiquity (c. 3rd–7th century CE) the Greeks referred to themselves as Rhomaioi (""Romans"" (Greek: Ῥωμαῖοι) or Romioi (Greek: Ρωμιοί)) since virtually all Greeks were Roman citizens after 212 CE. The term ""Hellene"" became applied to the followers of the polytheistic (""pagan"") religion after the establishment of Christianity by Theodosius I.*

On the contrary: with an agreed up second language, everyone can use that language. It would lessen their reliance on and the pressure of the languages of big neighbours. 

Basques and Catalans now are seen as French or Spanish when interacting with the outside world, because they have to fall back on their knowledge of French or Spanish to do so.

true,[deleted],null,null,"A women-only college is not equivalent to Islamic speakers refusing to speak in a university unless women and men are completely separated, or even women removed entirely from the room.  The whole purpose behind single-sex colleges was to improve the quality of education for women at what was traditionally a male-only university by giving them somewhere to stay in the city itself when attending lectures, as they were not allowed to stay at existing colleges.  It's not like women are getting any special privileges at Cambridge by virtue of there being a women-only college: everybody attends the same lectures, sits the same exams, and so on.  Colleges now are just glorified accommodation.  Even now, the trend is towards disbanding single sex colleges in favour of mixed sex colleges --- Oxford colleges are now all completely co-ed, for instance.  The situation won't persist, and it's an issue that's talked about quite readily, not hushed up as you are trying to imply.

However, the issue with Islamic speakers refusing to speak to women isn't one of the welfare of women.  It's that they're seen as inferior in the eyes of the speaker, or not worth talking to, or must be separated from men so that men aren't tempted by their presence, or some other stupid Medieval shit.  It's intent that matters.

Second, Newnham was built in 1871 (it's pretty young by Cambridge College standards) yet was still the second college behind Girton to actually admit women as students.  Somehow, despite women being only allowed to enter Cambridge University for ~140 years (and even then, female students were only fully admitted in 1948 --- prior to that, they could sit exams, attend lectures and so on but could not receive a Cambridge degree), and Newnham not being especially prestigious by College standards, you've managed to turn the situation of women being asked to leave the room when some backward speaker visits into a neckbearded rant about gender apartheid against males.

Yo. Bist ein toller Hecht. Kannst Programmieren und bekommst gutes Geld dafür! Gratuliere! Damit hast du natürlich auch eine Berechtigung Arbeiter zu dissen, weil sie dir deine zusammengeklickten Geschenke mal ein paar Tage nicht einpacken wollen oder eine Gewerkschaft als Terroristische Vereinigung zu bezeichnen. 

Ich arbeite in einem ähnlichen Lager als Hilfskraft um als Informatiker mal was anderes als den Bildschirm und so asoziale Arschlöcher wie dich zu sehen. 

Jedenfalls: Die Arbeit ist simpel aber auch anstrengend und erfordert schon eine gewisse Konzentration über einen längeren Zeitraum. Du bist 9 Stunden in einer Schicht am Rennen, hast 2 30x Minuten pausen und wenn du dir deine Schnitte reingefahren hast musst du schon wieder los. Ansonsten stehst und läufst du 4h am Stück. 

Mach das mal für 3 Monate täglich und insgesamt 1400€ im Monat. Mit Früh und Spätschicht und Nachtschicht - als Programmierer ist dir dein Schlaf sicher heilig - überleg dir mal was ein wöchentlicher Schichtwechsel so für Auswirkungen auf deinen Körper hat. 

Hinzu kommt, dass dort in der Tat alle möglichen lustigen Variationen von Menschen zusammenkommen und die Grundstimmung oft alles anderes als entspannt ist. Klare Vorgaben und Druck von Seiten des Managements und oft ungelöste Probleme weil die Software mal wieder spinnt sind Alltag. 

Jetzt bezeichnest du das Vorgehen dieser Arbeiter sich zusammenzuschließen und für bessere Bedingungen zu kämpfen als Terrorismus? 

Warscheinlich erfreust du dich auch daran, dass ein Großteil der Arbeiter unter Androhung vom H4-Kürzungen dort arbeiten müssen. Entweder man arbeitet dort für 8.50€/h und macht sich u.U. seinen Körper kaputt oder man wird obdachlos und muss hungern.

If Spain didn't shit all over the Estatut d'Autonomia, with humiliation and insult to the Catalan people who voted for it in a referendum, there would have been no independence movement to speak of.

I don't really see what being born in a geographical location has to do with nations of people, though the current laws may say otherwise. If you are fully a part of the British culture(which plenty people aren't) then you might have some claim, but even if I adopted something like Japanese culture the Japanese would still tell me to fuck off regardless. 

Apparently wanting a country composed of your ethnicity is a crime in Europe, but if it's for people like the Kurds it's freedom and glorious. Also, seems like the ""evil colonial powers"" get a lot of flak for drawing the borders in ways that grouped different peoples together. You'd think they'd be thanking the colonialists for the great multiculturalism. 

I thought the supporters of multiculturalism and all that were in favor of genetic diversity? yet at the same time they argue for the eventual mixing and return to homogeneity, so long as it isn't entirely a white group apparently, which would also affect the global scale of diversity.

You seem to be the only one insecure here with you bringing up your own personal circumstances and apparent need for people to acknowledge that you're British, as if your personal situation is any more relevant than just a hypothetical person.

&gt;Should I leave because 'white people' want their own country?

Even if you didn't leave, what would be wrong with stopping the influx of immigration or if some white people were to separate and form their own country, seeing as many believe they have a shared identity with those of the same ethnicity and/or race, and want it to be preserved. Or do you have the ""right"" to live in that new country as well?

Regarding your ""friend of a friend"" part, the stuff I said came from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia, a link you posted as proof yourself. And about the KLA being considered a terrorist organization by some: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_Liberation_Army
&gt; In February 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard, condemned both the actions of Serb government and of the KLA, and described the KLA as, ""without any questions, a terrorist group"". UN resolution 1160 took a similar stance.

&gt;France didn't delist the KLA until late 1998, after strong US and UK lobbying. KLA is still present in the MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base list of terrorist groups, and is listed as an inactive terrorist organization by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism from the Homeland Security.


So in response to those 4 points you made: 

* If you are questioning the sources of the information, I have to mention that wikipedia isn't the most reliable source itself. 

* A spokeswoman for the UN war crimes tribunal, the tribunal that has been accused of ignoring these organ trafficking incidents, is defending the tribunal. Huh, wouldn't have expected that.

* This isn't even related to the matter, I don't understand why this is relevant

* The Albanian man who is the Minister of Justice of Kosovo, the country whose prime minister has been accused of personally being involved in the organ trafficking, is defending it. This is a shocker as well. 

I also love how you're ignoring these parts: 
&gt; On December 12, 2010, the Council of Europe released a provisional report confirming Ms Del Ponte's allegations, and naming both Shaip Muja, current political adviser to the Kosovar Prime Minister, and Prime Minister Hashim Thaqi himself, in this context.

and

&gt;After the war in Kosovo, American journalist Michael Montgomery obtained testimony from seven former KLA soldiers who said they had transported prisoners, dead and alive, from Kosovo to Albania. Some of Montgomery's sources referred to the possibility of organ-trafficking and identified a small yellow farmhouse in the village of Rripë near the remote town of Burrel, Albania. Montgomery provided a summary of his research to the Office of Missing Persons and Forensics (OMPF) at the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). A team of UN and ICTY investigators visited the house in February 2004. They found widespread traces of blood of uncertain provenance on the floor and medical surgical equipment on the rubbish dump and in the riverbed. The family living in the house offered contradictory and inconsistent explanations for the blood and equipment.

Escoffier is one of the founders of the modern French haute cuisine. 

As I see it, the original ""Sauce Zingara"" was served in high-class restaurants during the early 1900s till WWII, so during the Wirtschaftswunder people tried to emulate it in order to have a bit of the high society life. But since they didn't have the fancy stuff required for the original (truffles, ox tongue), they had to simplify the recipe, while still calling it the same (Sauce Zingara = Zigeunersoße) and not thinking much about the name. You probably did the same if you ever called spaghetti with a minced meat sauce ""Spaghetti Bolognese"". Original Bolognese contains onions, celery and carots and takes hours to prepare, but the German Hausfrau wanted to copy the exotic food she ate during her vacation in Italy.

Non-è-così. E il primo problema, prima ancora di occuparci di credit worthiness e di come finanziare lo stato emettendo obbligazioni denominate in lire, è che *i nostri attuali debiti sono denominati in euro*. Non li possiamo ripagare in lire, se non convincendo i nostri creditori ad accettare il cambio di divisa e la conseguente riduzione effettiva del valore delle obbligazioni.

Questa operazione di rinegoziazione dei termini delle proprie obbligazioni si chiama *ristrutturazione del debito*, che è un modo educato e signorile di dire *default parziale*.

Una volta ""risolto"" questo problema (metto 'risolto' fra virgolette perché, considerata l'enorme mole del debito pubblico italiano, un'operazione del genere manderebbe gambe all'aria diverse banche italiane e straniere), rimarrebbero comunque tutti i problemi vecchi e se ne aggiungerebbero di nuovi: dopo averli fondamentalmente fregati, dovremmo convincere i nostri creditori a continuare a prestarci denaro, ossia accettare di emettere obbligazioni a tassi molto alti.

Yet, just like any other NATO country, they all get a vote.

He even pointed out more can be done with less. Because, lets face it, most budgets are strained as is. He pointed out Denmark coordinated with other nations well to provide more capability per dollar (or Euro, Krone) than if they only focused on their own defense budget.

true,Logothetes,GREE,Greece,"&gt;*In Ancient Greece to be Greek was to follow the Olympic gods but Christianity quickly took the place of it*

How Greek *followed the Olympic Gods* is not so simple. They were amazingly subtle thinkers. Gods were understood on many levels, and mostly as personified concepts. Each God would mirror idealised human characteristics and even pure ideals. (Think of Victory, Justice or Liberty being personified by statuesque ladies, ""*Lady Liberty*"" for example. By putting a wreath at the foot of the statue that personifies it, you seek honour **the idea of Liberty**).

Also, it depends what you mean by ""*Christianity quickly took the place of it*"". In 415 AD a Christian mob murdered (in the most horrific way) a woman called [Hypatia of Alexandria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia).  This woman was a professor, mathematician, and Neoplatonist philosopher, and the head of the Platonist school at Alexandria. Her death marked the end of Hellenism. If Homer lived around 850, BC by which time Hellenic mythology seems to have been rather well established, ""*quickly*"" means at least a millennium or two, especially if, as you have, you take  1,000 AD as the end date of the Hellenic religion.


&gt;*But overall in Greece, religion was a mix of both up until around 1,000ad when the last pagan Greeks in the area of south Peloponnesus ceased to follow it*

It was indeed mix. It is astounding how NeoPlatonic many Christian ideas are or how many sophisticated ethical concepts (reminiscent of Buddhism) are to be found in the New Testament. When compared to the self-serving tribal pseudo-ethics of the Old Testament, not to mention its primitive genocidal barbarism, it's like two entirely different worlds. Yet they are to be understood as part of the same mythology.

&gt;*Greece is the only country outside of Middle East to have a state religion and it is because the role the church played and during this time religion and ethnicity molded together.*

The role of the Christian Church in safeguarding the language, many ideas and a identity during the Ottoman occupation is undeniable. Without it, Greek may have disappeared altogether. It is right for this to be recognised. Nonetheless, ""*Greek*"" and ""*Orthodox Christian*"" are still not the same. It's more complex than that. Keep in mind that, Neo-Platonic or not, Christianity was still a heresy of Judaism imposed by Roman Emperors upon conquered Greeks. I'm quite fond of Christian Orthodoxy because there is much wisdom, kindness and love there and because it's familiar and part of our tradition. But I still find it ironic that it should be seen as ""*defining*"" what it means to be *""Greek*"".

&gt;*In the modern age being catholic or athiest won't make you a ""non-Greek"" but being Muslim will like you said*

Agreed. But this not *necessarily* the case. It is mostly due to the peculiar history of Balkan Muslims and is also our fault to some extent.  And again a lot depends on how you understand ""*Greek*"". Years ago I  met WASP University professor teaching in Boston, Mass (fluent in both Aristotelian and Homeric Greek) who was clearly more Greek in knowledge, mentality and  love of classical Greek ideals than most ""*Greeks*"" living in Greece, who though they might proudly call themselves Greeks, seem more Turkish than anything else in mentality.

But we did call out specific examples of misogyny and the threat, overt or implicit, of violence.

&gt;Anti immigration parties have already been founded in the 1850s, the Know Nothings for example who opposed Irish and German immigration because they were supposedly not integrating and destroying American culture. 

Arguably this is a pressure that some need to integrate, which is in short supply. Coddling them and saying ""keep everything about your culture"", which is a recent invention, seems to promote divisiveness in every country it is being attempted. The ""anything negative you say about them is racist and should be obliterated"" attitudes of today hardly compare to the ""shut the hell up and speak English"" attitudes of even the most pro-immigrant people back then. The entire ordeal could've also arguably been avoided in the first place; the Irish stirred up a lot of shit before they became integrated.

I don't know enough about the distinctions between pre-Irish and German culture and afterwards to say anything about their full impact.

&gt;because they were supposedly not integrating

More like not allowed to integrate in many ways, as with the Chinese. Now that it's all open arms to integrate(or not), no one seems to want to integrate. 

The old immigrants would cooperate when told it was they needed to be sent back, or they had to renounce their old citizenship. Good luck trying to get a good portion of the millions of illegals today to do either.

Gender separation in sports is a relic from the time when mass sports became popular, the late late 19th century. We should strive to judge people on their merit - and merit alone - everywhere, and that includes rugby and sports. Perhaps there won't be as much women in the top segments of rugby (or men in the top segments of gymnastics), but that's alright. I'm pretty sure the women rugby team in the subtop of rugby will still wipe the floor with a male team from the subsubtop.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;The proposal from China isn't bullshit, if they'd implement the necessary changes to the industrial and agricultural sector to reduce global warming, they'd suffer much more damage than those $100 billion dollars. 

They could simply levy a carbon tax on everything, including exports. That means the developed world would pay automatically and they don't need anyone's agreement to do it.

&gt;China is a giant that is growing enormously economically. Living standards are improving, even though the stories of smog and child labour might make you think otherwise. China is already on the level of a 2nd world country, being much bigger and stronger than India which has a population that isn't that much smaller.

It's also the biggest carbon emitter already. If China continues on this path, then the efforts of everyone else are practically guaranteed to be insufficient. If they're so powerful, they should pay... or else tone down their demands elsewhere too.

&gt;This is all made possible because China produces everything the 1st world needs. Toys, electronics, car parts, ships, boxes, plastic shit.. most of it is from China. China can only produce those because they're lacking harsh laws when it comes to environment. That's what makes them cheap. If they implement those anti-pollution laws, they're fucked.

No, why would they? Prices are going to rise to compensate for the decreased production.

&gt;ndia, Indonesia, the Phillipines, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam.. there are a lot of countries willing to produce what China can't produce cheaply then. It would be economic suicide. China can only produce those because they're lacking harsh laws when it comes to environment. That's what makes them cheap. If they implement those anti-pollution laws, they're fucked. India, Indonesia, the Phillipines, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam..

Well, why should we favor China above those countries? What really should happen is a global binding agreement that bans such production methods everywhere. Then we're done with whining about competition.

true,EliteCorps,trentino,null,"Sono di bolzano, bilingue, con madre tedesca e padre italiano ma ora esco. Quando torno leggerò l'articolo ed editerò questo post che nel frattempo farà da placeholder.

Edit - Sono tornato ieri sera abbastanza distrutto, il wall of text mi ha spaventato un po' e quindi ho concesso la partita.

L'articolo può risultare interessante per chi non ne sa nulla, cosa che mi sorprende visto che articoli come questo qui se ne leggono fin troppi. Però, come ha scritto /u/mucco, la maggior parte corrisponde alla realtà quotidiana ed è scritto bene.

Alcune cose però, a mio avviso, necessito commentarle in ordine cronologico:

&gt; «Ti puoi figurare se un sudtirolese si mette a produrre per una multinazionale inglese»,
chiosa l’uomo delle grappe. Infatti mentre mezzo mondo si sbraccia per attirare gli investimenti stranieri e prova a pensare globale, la mentalità da queste parti, figlia di un misto di tradizioni di un territorio montano e ultra cattolico e di resistenza all’invasore, pone il Südtirol stabilmente al centro del mondo e misura universale di tutte le cose, in uno splendido isolazionismo ultralocalista.

Ma se siamo il più venduto dei popoli, qui si venderebbe anche la propria madre. E come spiega in seguito l'articolo ci si appiccicherebbe un bel sticker ""Made in Südtirol"". Basta vedere grandi ditte come la Thun, Oberalp (Salewa, Dynafit etc), Aspiag-Despar, i vari produttori di mele, speck e vini..


&gt;Ogni residente deve dichiararsi di lingua italiana o tedesca e sulla base di questa dichiarazione ha accesso a determinati posti nelle amministrazioni pubbliche (in genere 7 posti su 10 sono appannaggio del gruppo di lingua tedesca), e all’assistenza sociale.

Può sembrare un male e sono d'accordo sul fatto che per la maggior parte in essenza lo è, ma considerate che se non ci fosse la dichiarazione di lingua, ci sarebbe il monopolio assoluto di tedeschi nella giunta e nei maggiori ruoli dell'amministrazione, essendo che la maggior parte della popolazione è di madrelingua tedesca.
Come ho detto prima, sono d'accordo che non dovrebbe essere così, ma purtroppo come spiega l'articolo qui la regola è ""autonomia - quindi deutsch first""

&gt;Rimane escluso dal sistema etnico proporzionale chi non compie la dichiarazione. Dopo quasi cento anni dall’annessione all’Italia non è ancora contemplata l’opzione «mistilingue» ovvero figlio o figlia di una coppia mista. Costoro devono scegliere fra una delle due possibilità oppure rinunciare ai lavorare nel pubblico e all’accesso al ricco welfare altoatesino.

Già, purtroppo è così, infatti mi sono dichiarato tedesco.

&gt;A capo di tutto questo sistema che appare complicato ma regola da oltre trent’anni la quotidianità degli altoatesini, ancora per qualche giorno c’è lui, Luis Durnwalder, che qui a Bolzano e provincia sarebbe l’equivalente di un Re, se solo paragonarlo ad monarca non fosse un po’ riduttivo.

Bullseye. Secondo la mitologia locale, è lui che tiene a bada Roma Ladrona, quindi gli spetta anche una retribuzione adeguata. Un'altra icona mitologica, ancora cantata nelle taverne dai vecchi Schützen è Silvius Magnago, il cosìddetto Padre del Pacchetto sudtirolese.

E anche sul commento finale l'articolo ci azzecca: Si parla tanto di togliere l'autonomia e/o unirsi all'austria, ma nulla di tutto ciò succederà nel prossimo futuro.

&gt; L'Europe du Bénélux + France + Allemagne + Italie, ça ne poserait aucun problème qu'on fusionne ces populations très proches pour en faire un Etat qui pèserait et qui aurait les moyens de mettre en place un certain nombre de projets.

Elles sont tellement proches que De Gaulle a dit dans sa [conférence de presse en 1962](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNGd7Vh6tLE) qu'il n'y aurait pas de politique possible à 6 à cause des intérêts divérgents, et que l'Europe se rangerait derrière quelqu'un du dehors.

En 1957, faire l'Europe, c'était la faire avec l'Italie (assombrie par son passage au fascisme), avec l'Allemagne (pestiférée mondiale) et les petits pays. Ca aurait donc été une Europe dominée par la France, à deux conditions :

+ refuser l'entrée du Royaume-Uni, qui n'auraient été qu'un cheval de Troie;
+ éloigner les Allemands des Etats-Unis.

Les deux points ont échoué puisque les Allemands ont toujours préféré suivre les Etats-Unis plutôt que d'être deuxièmes ou égaux avec la France, [en vidant de substance le Traité de l'Elysée.](http://www.upr.fr/dossiers-de-fond/de-gaulle-et-l-europe/introduction-3) en le modifiant avant de le ratifier.

First, I don't think that working class and other poorer people are the ""rightful owners"" of something they don't exactly own. When you lower a minimum wage, you don't take money from them, because they are free to work for whatever the salary they agree, it's not a serfdom. They can say ""no, thanks"" and try to find a job that would pay them more than a minimum wage. 

However, if you raise minimum wage, you my harm business owners and make small businesses go bankrupt. And in that way you hurt the whole country because businesses are what keeps countries alive and generates most income to their budgets in a form of taxes. When businesses fail, the whole nation becomes poor because there are no jobs and no money. This is why we always try to save businesses first. Countries like Greece decided they need to save your so-called dignity and to keep salaries high, and now they're gone. The whole country is gone, dude. That's why austerity wouldn't mean jack shit even if we didn't raise wages after crisis. It saved our country, you see.

Oh, and I can say that our minimum wage is 1000 Litas now instead of 800 Litas in 2009. Be cool, everyone can keep his or her dignity!

Oh, oh, and you should really stop using phrases like ""people are getting back what austerity STOLE from them"" because you sound pathetic. It's free market, not North Korea. You don't like your wage, you demand more or look for other job. Nobody can steal anything from you even if they made minimum wage 1$ per month. You don't agree to work for 1$ and they have to pay you more.

During the day, beer is just something people like to drink, so whether you choose to have coffee, cola/juice or a beer is really a simple matter of personal preference.  
A note on colas: [Afri](http://www.getraenkeservice-muenchen.com/shop/catalog/images/Afri-Cola-Classic.jpg) and [Fritz](http://www.bottelini.com/shop/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/700x/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/f/r/fritz_kola.jpg) cola are very common in bars and cafés.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Not Poland but the planned missile defense shield in Poland, which Russians think will shift ""nuclear balance.""

That's because it will. MAD is based on the principle that after one side launches a nuclear attack on the other, the other will still have enough of a remaining second strike capacity to assure mutual destruction. This shield would be overwhelmed by a Russian first strike, but it would be effective against a second strike after much of the Russian capacity had been taken out by a US first strike.  
That's why it's perceived as an offensive measure, not a defensive one. It takes the ""mutual"" part out of MAD. If the US was intending a first strike against Russia, this shield would be a necessary first step. The US would go ape shit if Russia implemented a maritime missile shield along its coasts as well, just as it did when the Soviets stationed rockets on Cuba after the US had stationed theirs in Turkey.",0,1387219648,null,0,false,0,ce36j4z,t3_1t0hkj,t1_ce36j4z,t1_ce35ut0,null,1428107374,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16
