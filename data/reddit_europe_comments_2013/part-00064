&gt; If you get to change the constitution or pass any law you want, then that's not a democracy. 

Constitutions in all nations are prone to change. The US can easily change its constitution and has done over 20 times. In the UK we don't have a codified constitution (as in it is *not* written in *one*, single document). The constitution is vested in various laws and acts. The Parliament of the day can change any one of these acts, whenever it pleases, with a simple majority. In the US it is slightly more difficult as you need a 2/3 or 3/4 majority (super majority) to amend the constitution. My point is that being able to change the constitution has no bearing on how democratic a country is. Constitutions are not integral parts of democracy, as the UK demonstrates. So a state's ability to change its constitution is just a part of its democratic process. You're not ""undemocratic"" for having a constitution which can be easily changed. If anything, you're more democratic because constitutions often go against the will of the citizens of the day, but that's a more controversial issue. 

Sticking more throughly to what you wrote:

&gt;The constinutional court can give opinions - but not being able to reject constitutional laws

The supreme court being able to reject a constitution amendment would sounds *extremely* undemocratic to me. Judges are usually unelected and merely appointed by some previous government, with the people of a nation having no say. Judges are hard to impeach and very rarely reflect public opinion (they tend to value property over individual liberty).

So yeah, I *really* disagree with point number three. From what I know of the situation(which is next to nothing) and from what you two have said, it sounds like the courts are working like courts are supposed to. A check and balance on government, but still, ultimately, subordinate to the government through the democratic process. Sure, your judiciary is not perfect. I don't know a lot about your judiciary, but I can tell you it is not perfect because *no judiciary is perfect* just like *no government is ever perfect*.

&gt;Das gilt auch für empirische Studien und Befragungen, die sich zur häufigsten Form von Forschung entwickelt haben. Da werden deutsche Arbeiter über ihre türkischen Kollegen befragt und Vorurteile entdeckt. Da werden Mütter entlarvt, die ihren zu dicken Säugling für normalgewichtig halten. Da wird festgestellt, dass Kinder von Eltern, die rauchen, das Laster oft übernehmen. Nichts ist trivial genug, um nicht in einer durch Drittmittel geförderten Studie mal schnell erforscht zu werden. Da die Forscher dabei empirisch vorgehen und angeblich in direktem Kontakt zur Wirklichkeit stehen, glauben sie auf jede Art von Wissen, vor allem auf altes, verzichten zu können. Wichtig ist die Botschaft - zum Beispiel: Männer mit jüngeren Frauen leben länger als solche mit gleichaltrigen. Dass ein solches Ergebnis auch andere Gründe haben kann als das bloße Alter des Partners, beispielsweise ein gesunder Lebenswandel, wird ausgeblendet. Die Nachricht muss möglichst simpel sein. Studien sind daher weitgehend wissensfrei.

Nein, sind sie nicht. Aber man kann ihm ja nicht böse sein, dass er von Statistik, von Korrelation und Kontrollvariablen keine Ahnung hat. Als ob der Fortschritt in den Wissenschaften nur aus den gesammelten Gedanken irgendwelcher ""Gelehrten"" kommt. Als ob

Da spricht jemand aus dem Leid der unterbezahlten Geisteswissenschaften, die ihre Folianten schon seit Jahrhunderten die Berge hoch- und runterrollen, in denen die meisten ""wissenschaftlichen"" Werke aus dem widerkäuen anderer Leute Gedanken bestehen und deren Beitrag zur Vergrößerung des Wissens in den meisten Fällen ganz schön mau ist. Das liegt aber nicht an der Organisation, der Uni, die keinen guten Rahmen vorgibt oder dem Professor, der zu viel zu tun hat. Das liegt daran, dass irgendwann alles über, beispielsweise die Großen der Literatur gesagt und geschrieben ist, dreimal gesammelt, neu interpretiert und in Dissertationen gequetscht wurde. Wenn man sich aufraffen könnte, aus den Bibliotheken heraus zu kommen und neue Mittel nutzte, den Computer beispielsweise, dann könnte man auch wieder wissenschaftlichen Mehrgewinn schaffen.

Je comprends pas ce que tu veux dire. Le problème du coût n'est pas le problème de la répartition salariale ou du salaire. Il est lié à la protection sociale qui n'existe pas dans ces pays. 

&gt;Je ne suis pas sur de voir le lien entre avoir une politique industrielle nationale et contrôler les prix. La proposition n'est pas de créer une société soviétique.

Bah je ne sais pas, il n'y avait pas de référence. Il semblerait qu'il s'agisse uniquement de mettre des taxes importantes sur les produits non nécessaires. Et inversement de contrôler les prix de ce qui est nécessaire. C'est pas tellement de la politique industrielle mais plutôt du contrôle des prix. 

&gt;Pour qu'un programme aussi timoré apparaisse utopiste, il faut vraiment que l'espoir soit bas dans ce pays...

Bah moi j'explique pourquoi il me semble utopiste, tu n'expliques pas pourquoi tu dis qu'il est timoré. 

&gt;Il y a cette idée fausse qui se balade, qui dit que les industries sont nécessairement polluantes, qu'on ne peut pas industrialiser sans polluer et qu'on ne peut pas faire diminuer la pollution sans diminuer l'industrie. C'est simplement faux. Des normes écologiques peuvent à la fois stimuler l'innovation industrielle et le développement des services. 

Franchement excuse-moi du peu mais ça c'est faux. L'industrie, c'est comme les médicaments, t'as des risques et des avantages. Ou alors exemples ? Parce que c'est un peu facile de parler de normes environnementales quand on n'a plus d'industries extractives, plus d'industrie lourde, etc. L'activité humaine même pré-industrielle a un impact. 

&gt;Même si c'est la notion de la ruralité pour tout le monde n'est pas ma vision préférée, force est de constater que niveau vision, y a pas beaucoup de partis qui en fournissent. Et cette vision là reste encore extrêmement limitée.

La notion de ruralité, c'est du noyautage des verts et autre alter. Cela n'a aucun rapport avec des valeurs de gauche ou d'égalité sociale et j'appelle pas vraiment ça de la vision non. C'est juste passéiste. 

&gt;C'est drôle, je lisais du de Gaulle ce weekend (Mémoires d'Espoir) et c'est fou de voir comme la société s'est droitisé. S'il revenait aujourd'hui, avec son indexation des prix du blé, avec ses nationalisations et ses Plans (avec un grand P) industriels nationaux, il passerait pour plus à gauche que Mélenchon!

Je pense que la politique de reconstruction méritait une gestion centralisée et l'action de l'Etat. De plus aujourd'hui, le poids de l'Etat dans l'économie au travers des transferts sociaux est nettement plus important qu'à l'époque. Et l'interventionnisme étatique n'est en rien une spécificité de gauche, cf le complexe militaro-industriel ricain. 

L'indexation ça répondait à un phénomène précis non ? C'est absolument pas mort comme outil, cf des trucs comme la TICPE ( ex TIPP ). 

&gt;Alors certes, c'est une référence du passé, mais force est de constater que ""ce qui a changé"" depuis, c'est la libéralisation des différents marchés qui ont amené à la crise qu'on a en ce moment. Il y a trop de personnes qui pensent que le progrès n'est que la suppression de régulations. Beau résultat, vraiment.

Je ne suis pas d'accord. C'est une lecture minimaliste. Il y a un power shift actuellement en raison de la montée des émergents et qu'on observe en accéléré. Le système financier produit peut-être un effet de levier qui accentue les tendances mais cela ne remet pas en cause ce que chacun peut observer par ailleurs. Tout va vite, tout va très vite et les groupes extrêmes qui prétendent proposer de nouveaux paradigmes en réalité ne font que transposer tel quel des raisonnements passéistes.

This kind of callous approach to changing constitutional law should be chilling.  In old/mature liberal democracies there's built-in inertia that's both institutional and cultural.  The ""you can vote them out"" argument for constitutions only holds water when a measure of democracy, basic liberties and an intelligentsia that's not directly under state control exists and remains to exist.

I don't know you but from your post I get the feeling that you don't live in Hungary and don't speak Hungarian. Who are you to tell me then that the press is censored? I can obviously read articles on my own and decide if there's censorship or not. The two largest and most influential internet news sites (www.index.hu and www.origo.hu) are anti-government and every day they criticize the actions of the government. You know what happened today? The EU recognized that the Hungarian economy is in better shape than it was believed, and is in an upward trend, while most regional economies are worse than they were. You know how this was published on those websites? On index.hu nothing, on origo.hu: ""We're good but..."" Do you think in a country with censorship, the two largest and most influential news sites would be allowed to keep working that way? And they're rather mild compared to nol.hu or watching ATV, since those proudly admit that they're ""left aligned"". How is it self-censorship when another large news agency, HVG, publishes an article with the title ""Orban Viktor is stubborn and an idiot""? 

There are also many, many pictures and caricatures ridiculing the government.

Really, I don't understand what it is that you want. Do you want Hungarian newspapers to show the government eating shit, with a huge title ""THEY ALL SUCK COCK LOL"", to believe that criticism of the government is possible and allowed?

&gt; but the police are being instructed to arrest everyone doing it and accusing them of sleeping on the streets.

You're making the Hungarian police look like the Gestapo, but the truth is the homeless people still continue to sleep in the metro stations, even now when it has been made illegal. I don't really understand how you imagine Hungary, do you think homeless people are hiding in dark corners scared that the SS will discover them? Or that they're forced to sleep in the snow? The Hungarian police is so lenient they're even being made fun of that they're cowards.

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"&gt; Le problème du coût n'est pas le problème de la répartition salariale ou du salaire. Il est lié à la protection sociale qui n'existe pas dans ces pays.

Il y a en effet ces deux aspects. Je proposais de lutter contre le dumping des salaires, mais c'est vrai que du coup ça ne tient pas compte des protections sociales. Peut être qu'il y a une métrique à inventer qui tienne compte de l'ensemble des revenus directs et indirects des travailleurs. Pas facile à mettre au point ce truc...

&gt; Ou alors exemples ?

Impose aux cimenteries des normes d'émissions de CO2 et elles doivent se rénover, elles en profitent pour se moderniser, produisent un peu plus, émettent beaucoup moins. Si des barrières douanières les protègent de la concurrence des entreprises qui n'ont pas à engager ces coûts, elles peuvent rester rentables. De plus tu as créé tout un tissu industriel autour du besoin de la réduction d'émissions.

Le but est de polluer moins à production constante. C'est possible, c'est simplement un guide que l'on impose à l'innovation.

&gt; Je pense que la politique de reconstruction méritait une gestion centralisée et l'action de l'Etat. 

Je parle de son retour en 58, donc une fois la reconstruction déjà bien avancée. Ils avaient déjà relibéralisé le prix du blé, et lui l'a réindexé. Et son parti était classé à droite.

&gt; L'indexation ça répondait à un phénomène précis non ? C'est absolument pas mort comme outil, cf des trucs comme la TICPE ( ex TIPP ).

Au moins on est d'accord là dessus.

&gt; Je ne suis pas d'accord. C'est une lecture minimaliste. 

C'est une lecture des différentes dérégulations de la finance qui ont amené à la création de produits dérivés de plus en plus complexes et à la catastrophe qu'on a connu. Regarde les différents garde-fous qui ont sauté depuis les années 90, la catastrophe était écrite.

&gt; les groupes extrêmes qui prétendent proposer de nouveaux paradigmes en réalité ne font que transposer tel quel des raisonnements passéistes.

Déjà, le parti dont on parle, le Parti de Gauche, n'est pas extrême. Son programme est un peu plus à droite que celui de Mitterrand. L'extrême, c'est le NPA. Le FdG, ils n'auraient pas accueilli le petit reste du PCF, ils seraient considéré comme des Solfériniens tendance Montebourg.

Ensuite, qu'y a-t-il de passéiste à proposer une taxation sociale et écologique à la frontière ? Ça a déjà été fait ? Quand ? Il y a déjà eu des barrières douanières pour raisons de stratégie économique, mais jamais pour raisons sociales et écologiques. 

Personnellement, je vois ça comme s'inscrivant dans un processus continu : on a commencé par enlever des barrières protectionnistes qui se justifiaient par une idée fausse de l'économie, on a atteint finalement le maximum de ce que permet le système libéral et maintenant que les défauts deviennent évident et le système mieux compris, il semble raisonnable de voir comment et dans quelles conditions en remettre.

&gt;For example, I view London as one of the most unsafe places in Europe. I was there two times, one time I got mugged and the other time I've heard gunshots.

London is a weird one because it's just so vast; there are large parts of that city where you would never encounter any crime and other parts where it's something you deal with daily.

That's true of most large places I guess but I think London deserves a special mention for being so much bigger and more populated than its European counterparts by a huge margin.

&gt;Some capitals score better at low homicide rates, and instead have loads of petty crime. Others are the other way around.

Excellent point and in fact it's a dichotomy I have personal experience of - Gibraltar, where I'm from, has a situation where you'd be crazy to fall asleep on a bench or not pay attention to where your bag is; on the other hand I'd be perfectly happy to leave my window open/door unlocked whilst I was out without fear of being burgled.

The type of crime and how it manifests itself matters.

&gt;Now, this isn't about quality of life. The two might be related more than often, but sometimes they aren't.

You can't separate them either though; my example of Longbyearbyen along with the entire ""country"" of Svalbard has essentially zero crime - the same is true of a place like the Falkland Islands but the reason those places aren't filled to the brim, is that not many people want to live on an island in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do (Even if I kind of do from time to time!).

You can take from this that consideration of crime is probably quite low on people's quality of life decision making, at least beyond a certain base ""threshold"" that could be statistical or something as simple as a separation of First, Second or Third World.

&gt; Of course some capitals might have low crime but be complete shitholes compared to other capitals. In that regard, I would rather live in London and get mugged on a monthly basis, than live in Bucharest.

I'm not sure if I'd agree with the last part :P but yep you're absolutely right in principle.

&gt;But in reality, before moving to Sweden, I had never heard of crimes the likes you get here. First year here, bombing in Stockholm, fires in Malmo. A lot of rapes. Shootings in the newspapers seem to be on a weekly basis.

I think all capital cities have a dirty, gritty side to them, it just comes from putting such a concentration of diverse people in one place. There's beauty to that too of course.

A distinction has to be made at this point though; a capital city is actually a pretty bad descriptor - between ""ceremonial"" capitals, capitals in low population/high wealth countries, capitals within territories or islands and so on; it's sort of an arbitrary designation of convenience, one that too many people put far too much emphasis on in my eyes.

&gt;""Immigrants!"" I was told. As if that should make me feel better, as if I wasn't an immigrant myself.

That's always a foolish catch-all that people use, in fairness I understand that the current problem of rape in Sweden is inextricably linked with the immigrant population and that's not something we should shy away from either. Not that that's something that should reflect on you but it's unavoidable and understandable no?

&gt;On the other hand, all these seemed to be happening just in the newspapers. Somehow Sweden as a society remains, for your average Joe, apparently an utopia.

It's all a matter of perspective and relativity. Statistically you're pretty safe in first world countries and the chances of being a victim of crime, the type of crime, the justice system failing you etc. are all linked to that.

With that said, a single bad experience of yourself or someone close to you can colour you for life, others will go through their life being terrified of crime or the complete opposite and never think about it, some will even embrace it; I know people who moved to places like London because they felt that dark side made them feel alive.

We're straying into the feeling/emotional side now though, which is impossible to lay out in any meaningful way. I think it's just up to an individual to find a place they feel safe, happy and comfortable - whether that's an arctic research station, Kensington Palace Gardens, a council estate in Hull or on dismount patrol in Afghanistan!

&gt;But that was pretty much the ignition point of my interest in perceptions.

It's certainly intriguing, you should prepare yourself for coming away from it none-the-wiser though. ;P

&gt;Because you see, not only the people's perception about me and my country were way off, but also my perception about everything around me was way off, and as much as I'd love to pin-point this on the media, in reality I think there are other factors that influence our perceptions much more than the media, although I have yet to realize what those factors might be.

All you can do is be a good person and change minds throughout your life, there's no way you can singlehandedly clear the name of Romanians nor should you let that perception bind you.

Being a newshawk can get distressing sometimes but being aware of your surroundings is no bad thing either.

&gt;in the end, maybe, just maybe - perception does say something too.

I'd say it's more to do with individual outlook and personality actually, at some point you just have to either accept there's little to nothing you can do to avoid being the victim of certain crimes or lock yourself away for the rest of your life.

true,flyingorange,VOJV,Vojvodina,"In Hungary the constitution is not changed through a referendum, it's changed by the unicameral parliament if more than 2/3 of the MPs vote yes. 

&gt; Speaking of Hungary, flyingorange's comment might be a little unclear - did the CC ""change"" the constitution in the past? 

What happened was that the government fucked up on some of the technicalities and the CC striked them down. I can't remember a good example now, so the following may not be 100% true: in the constitution they wrote that denying the crimes of communism is forbidden, *and that this is a temporary constitutional law*. No idea why they made it temporary. The CC said that they think the article is technically not temporary, so they made the whole article invalid.

What happened now was they wrote the same thing back in the constitution with the words ""and this is not temporary"".

Similar things happened with the rule about homeless people etc. The CC never complained that the articles are contradictory or that they're unconstitutional, they always complained about some technicality. More important, some of the articles they invalidated they did so based on rules of the *previous* constitution. This means, in the period before 2011, let's say in 1995, the CC made a rule that if homeless people must have a personal ID, then they can sleep where they like. So then in 2012 they made a law that homeless people can't sleep on the streets. The CC said ""but according to the rule from 1995, they have personal IDs which may be interpreted that their address is the street which means they can't be denied from sleeping at their own home"". And they invalidated that article. Based on a rule that was derived from the previous constitution.

What happened now was the change of rules, now the CC can't use rules made prior to 2011 anymore.

Does this all make sense? I've been writing these kind of explanations before and I always get downvoted so I don't know if it makes any sense doing it anymore. This subreddit hates the Hungarian government and no amount of reason will change that. The problem is these things that we argue about here, these false claims by a non-Hungarian journalist, are not even important. If we want to talk about problems in Hungary let's talk about corruption, the rising flood of immigrants at the borders or how the nazis are becoming louder and making all of us look bad.

&gt;Je parle de son retour en 58, donc une fois la reconstruction déjà bien avancée. Ils avaient déjà relibéralisé le prix du blé, et lui l'a réindexé. Et son parti était classé à droite.

Je n'ai pas de détail particulier sur cette affaire, mais je ne vois pas ce que ça prouve. On sait bien qu'en France, la droite sociale est plus présente que la droite financière. Cf les classifications sur les trois types de droite. 

&gt;C'est une lecture des différentes dérégulations de la finance qui ont amené à la création de produits dérivés de plus en plus complexes et à la catastrophe qu'on a connu. Regarde les différents garde-fous qui ont sauté depuis les années 90, la catastrophe était écrite.

Non, c'est une lecture minimaliste. La bulle financière existe parce que les économies occidentales ne produisent plus de croissance et donc des systèmes de levier économique tentent de tirer artificiellement cette croissance vers le haut. Quand ça éclate on entre en récession et on peut alors avoir les chiffres réels moyennés de la croissance telle que prédite par les modèles économiques, démographiques etc. Actuellement, la croissance réelle se trouve plutôt en Chine, en Inde en Indonésie, au Brésil. 

&gt;Déjà, le parti dont on parle, le Parti de Gauche, n'est pas extrême. Son programme est un peu plus à droite que celui de Mitterrand. L'extrême, c'est le NPA. Le FdG, ils n'auraient pas accueilli le petit reste du PCF, ils seraient considéré comme des Solfériniens tendance Montebourg.

Je n'ai pas dit extrémiste, j'ai dit extrême. Ils parlent de révolution à chaque point; c'est pas moi qui l'invente. Je ne l'entends pas particulièrement comme une insulte pas plus que je n'essaie de faire des comparaisons obsolètes avec 81 ( surtout sur le thème de l'écologie qui n'était pas tellement central ). La distinction entre une ""vraie"" écologie de retour au source et une écologie compatible avec un système économique libéral me semble être une manoeuvre plus destinée à ratisser large des électeurs écolo déçus. 

&gt;Ensuite, qu'y a-t-il de passéiste à proposer une taxation sociale et écologique à la frontière ? Ça a déjà été fait ? Quand ? Il y a déjà eu des barrières douanières pour raisons de stratégie économique, mais jamais pour raisons sociales et écologiques. 

??? J'ai dit que ce qui était passéiste c'était l'espèce de retour au source et de malthusianisme décroissant qui fleure bon l'anti-nucléaire, l'anti-recherche, l'anti-progrès. 

&gt;Personnellement, je vois ça comme s'inscrivant dans un processus continu : on a commencé par enlever des barrières protectionnistes qui se justifiaient par une idée fausse de l'économie, on a atteint finalement le maximum de ce que permet le système libéral et maintenant que les défauts deviennent évident et le système mieux compris, il semble raisonnable de voir comment et dans quelles conditions en remettre

Encore une fois, je répète ce que j'ai dit. Des barrières douanières sociales ou écologiques oui, les mettre en place par refus de la remise en question notamment sur la compétitivité et la qualité des produits français, non. Un des derniers exemples en date, c'est le diesel qui nous asphyxie et que le gouvernement a mis en place pour protéger les fabricants français et dont on ne sait plus quoi faire. 

&gt;C'est une évolution logique de la mondialisation. On l'a accomplie, on a vu ses bénéfices et ses défauts. Améliorons la.

L'évolution logique de la mondialisation c'est 7 milliards puis 8 puis 9 de personnes avec l'envie et peut-être la possibilité de vivre le même train de vie que les Français. J'ai l'impression que la réflexion de ce manifeste, c'est soit comment les en empêcher, soit comment dresser un mur autour de la France pour protéger notre petit mode de vie. Je suis pas certain que ça marche des masses.

I didn't know that. In Romania, 2/3 of Parliament may *initiate* constitutional changes, but those still need to be approved by referendum - and this is in the Constitution.

This renders most of the legitimity argument moot - if the CC finds a law unconstitutional, the Parliament can simply change the constitution to fit that law, and this fits particularly well the FIDESZ in the current state of affairs, with more than 2/3 of Parliament under their control.

As a matter of fact, it is made simple by the [2013 amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Constitution#2013_amendment):

&gt;the court cannot annul a law passed by a two-thirds parliamentary majority.

I suppose some of the international suspicions are based simply on the fact of the 2/3 FIDESZ majority which passed a constitution favoring 2/3 Parliamentary majorities. The fact is, whatever they vote now, it won't be easy to undo for a long time to come, and they get to name the members of the CC (by a 2/3 majority) for 12 years.

It's not that they have an anti-French bias, but rather they are pro-liberalization, an economic model many French are still wary of. The Economist has often seen France as the main obstacle to further economic liberalization in the West, particularly in the EU, though that has waned with Germany's economic resurgence.

I think a lot of French are also sensitive about this issue. Gaullism is still a very strong force in French political culture. The idea that France is and should strive to be a great power is a dearly held belief. It is difficult for some to accept that Britain's imperial legacy far outshines France's. English is the world's lingua franca, not French. Liberalization is the dominant  global economic force, not protectionism.

I really think cultural factors are a lot less of a factor. I'm Romanian, living in a city right next to the Hungarian border.

For hungarians, the attitude is oftentimes opposite - they have an extremely strong feeling of national identity and pride, to the point where some of my romanian-born hungarian friends felt discriminated against in hungary for not being ""pure"" enough, for having an odd accent etc. While in Hungary the country is led by a right-wing party, in Romania the only hardline right-wing party pretty much dissolved into nothingness over the years, as the political scene matured.",0,1365022824,null,0,false,0,c97wf8i,t3_1bkx0a,t1_c97wf8i,t1_c97ou57,null,1431683824,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Well, are you going to stop all medias?
There's no way you can stop yourself from being influenced unless you live a hermit life.

And to me it seems like you are arguing like one of the politicians (sorry, I guess) that want to forbid violent games because they think that these games actively make people violent.
That is simply not true. Violent people (may) play violent video games. But non-violent (may) also play violent video games. And if you are old enough (and atleast somewhat educated) you can see where reality stops and video games start. That's where the USK and PEGI and whatnot start to work (atleast they should). They prevent young kiddos that are not able to see the difference from playing these games. Of course this does not always work because there are still kids and teenagers that can play these games without being damaged and there are adults that are going to struggle with it. 

But games like GTA also deliver a certain message to the player through the violence. Yes, you can play the game by simply driving over pedestrians and killing people with a tank but if you actually play through the story you realize that there is also something behind the violence (if you understand the story). That's atleast how I understood the game.

You said European countries so that is not only countries in the EU. I don't know how Russia will react. Maybe they will take North Korea's side but at most they will supply them with weapons. With both the Korean war and the Vietnam war Russians have shown that they don't like to lose their man in other people's battles.

The rest of Eastern Europe will be on the same page as Western Europe I think.

My personal hope is that no European country will interfere in any way. Neither economic nor military. In my opinion the last thing we must do, especially with the crisis, is waste money to help anyone fight a war that isn't ours. Don't let me even get started on how stupid it would be to waste our man and women, our citizens for a cause that isn't even remotely related to us.

In a direct answer to your question-I think that some countries will try to intervene economically and I hope no one is stupid enough to waste their soldiers. Obviously all countries, except maybe Russia, will declare that they are on the side of South Korea although I think we should be neutral and not intervene in any way whatsoever.

The main fault lies with the distributors who just can't accept that they are making adult products. They don't want to miss out on marketing and the younger market to which a lot of (violent) games aim at.

The people deciding about what gets put on the index or what rating something gets aren't even allowed to tell specific things that would need to be changed for a different decision, and afaik on resubmitting a changed version it's always a different team rating it.",0,1365024937,null,0,false,0,c97x8e1,t3_1blklx,t1_c97x8e1,t3_1blklx,null,1431683442,14,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,14

true,arrrg,null,null,"There are several things you have to give to your employer. The HR people at wherever you are working should be able to help you with that and give more detailed explanations so calling them might always be a good idea (they are the experts and it’s also their job to make this work smoothly, after all) but I will try to mention everything important.

Your employer needs your tax id number. If the letter you got is from your local tax office (where you are registered) then that’s likely the letter with the number. They should call it “Identifikationsnummer” in the letter.

The company you work at may also want some sort of income tax card. That’s currently a major clusterfuck since that card is in the process of being abolished (switching over to a completely electronic process). You should still be able to get a nice rubber-stamped and signed page from your local tax office with all the relevant tax info on it if your employer wants that. You have to visit your local tax office for that. I had to show my ID card, so you should probably bring your passport. I’m not sure. Maybe just give them a call beforehand and ask them.

Then you need health insurance. If you want to join the public system in Germany you have to pick one of the public insurers. There are many of them and I really couldn’t tell you which one you should pick.

But you probably should just give one – any one – a call and ask what to do. When I did that recently (because I started an internship this month) they were very helpful. [Here is the number of the TK, for example, one of the public insurers.](http://www.tk.de/tk/tk/english/145048) Just give them a call, say that you are maybe interested in joining and ask what the process would be and whether there is anything you should know.

Once you are member of a public insurer everything’s real simple: You call them, tell them where you work and they will send – either to you or to your employers directly, you can chose – a confirmation letter that you really are member. Your employer will take care of all the rest.

Your health insurance is also where you can ask to get your social security ID card sent to you. Your employer needs this one, too. The most important thing on this one is your SSN which is not the same as your tax  ID number.

Auf Seite 3 ist eine Tabelle wo die Toten pro Terrawattstunde aufgelistet sind. Diese wird auch im Wiki Artikel ""Stromerzeugung"" aufgegriffen. Allerdings fehlen alle Stromezeugungsarten die nicht auf Verbrennung oder Fission basieren. Ich war mal in den Neunzigern bei Areva (damals Framatome) auf Klassenfahrt. Dort hat uns ein Typ einen Vortrag gehaltern, nachdem der Atomstrom die meisten regenerativen Energieformen in Bezug auf C02 Verbrauch und gesundheitsschädliche Auswirkungen in die Tasche stecken würde. Allerdings hat der Typ sein eigenes Diagramm die ganze Zeit falsch Interpretiert, Die Windkraft hatte in seinen Tabellen z.B. einen niedrigeren CO2 Verbrauch als Atomstrom. Wie dem auch sei, solange weder eine wirtschaftliche Speicherform für Elektrizität, noch eine bessere Stromvernetzung in Europa oder flächendeckend kleine, schnellanlaufende, wetterunabhängige Stromerzeuger (z.B. Blockheizkraftwerke) die Realität sind ist ein Verzicht auf Grundlastkraftwerke nicht denkbar. Aus diesem Grund wurden in den letzen Jahren verstärkt Gaskraftwerke (hoher Wirkungsgrad, relativ saubere Verbrennung, Grundlastfähig, schnell anlaufend) gebaut. Die regenerativen Energieformen haben in Deutschland mit über 20% der Stromerzeugung einen beachtlich hohen Wert erricht, das heuißt aber nicht, dass man einfach 5 mal soviele Kraftwerke aufstellen und alles andere abschalten kann.

For every study you show me claiming direct influence on children of violent, extremist, or pornographic media (including games), I will show you a reputable counter-study disputing such effects, or concluding that there is no statistically significant causation or even correlation, e.g. [[1](http://www.tamiu.edu/newsinfo/newsarticles/2013-MediaViolence011713.shtml)] [[2](http://www.bmj.com/content/331/7509/122)] - and yes, I have put quite a bit of research into it since our own parliament decided a few years ago that violent video games indubitably cause violence and basically told anyone who tried to convince them otherwise to go stfu.

Now if you are talking about ""television commercials"" as opposed to just ""commercial television"",  that is a completely different issue - e.g. toy and fast food advertisements are intentionally designed to manipulate particularly children into wanting the products the ads are selling, through deliberate use of colors, terminology, imagery, etc.  This is an oft-proven phenomenon that I won't debate.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"It really is. It resembles many confederations or proto-federations, but there is an important difference. What makes the EU different from other unification efforts is primarily its scale and diversity. Whereas the German confederation was the first step toward unifying small and constantly changing principalities and states in a relatively small geographic area, the EU leads the gradual unification of countries with thousands of years of history, identity, and rivalry and animosity amongst each other. The EU is aimed at continental unification, which has never been successful (since the only way it has been attempted before is through conquest and forced subjugation).

ASEAN is not a supranational union in the way the EU is. It is a regional organization designed to promote dialogue among its members. It aims to preserve sovereignty through this method rather than relinquish it to a central authority. A supranational union is not possible in Asia given the prevalence of nationalism and continued mistrust, bitterness, and even hatred among Asian countries.

The African Union is too big and too weak to be relevant as a supranational entity. The continent is too diverse, too poor, and too bloody for it to resemble anything like the EU in this century.

Similarly, the Arab League is united primarily through a loose idea that there is a common Arab identity, through reigion, language, culture, and history. The problem is that many of these countries don't like each other, have widely different interests, and is further complicated by membership of North African countries in the African Union.

South American integration, through UNASUR, is explicitly modeled after European integration. South America represents the next most likely region where a supranational union could function. Democratic institutions and rule of law are stronger in South America relative to most of the rest of the world. A common colonial heritage, with two main languages makes it a less diverse continent than Europe. It never experienced war on the scale that Europe has, which may or may not affect its long term development.

A North American Union could work in theory, if limited to Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The main problem would be that the United States would dominate the union, since it is by far the largest and most powerful country. A secondary problem would be Mexico's economic weakness relative to the other two. It would be easier to justify a union to Americans and Canadians if Mexico wasn't as populous as it is. Unfortunately, it won't happen anytime soon, because nationalism in the region (particularly in the United States) is far too powerful.

I point out all these regional organizations because it shows what a unique position Europe is in.

&gt;The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

&gt;Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.

What's important to point out is that it does not force all member states to declare war on the aggressor, rather that NATO will pursue a course it deems necessary.

However, let's get into a hypothetical situation where part of San Francisco is destroyed by a North Korean nuclear attack. I have no doubt that most NATO members would stand ready to actually fight North Korea, but it would really depend on whether or not the US asks them to. A resumption of the Korean War could be won by the United States and South Korea alone, since they have overwhelming military superiority and have been planning for it for the past sixty years. Adding in some NATO countries that haven't been in those planning sessions may only make the operation more difficult. In this scenario, I think NATO countries would probably provide logistical and operational support, and *maybe* a few countries would actually fight (I'm thinking Britain and France most likely).

true,Mugros,,Niedersachsen,"&gt; I should probably have mentioned that it was a translation task, so some of the words and wordings had to remain the way they were, even though they weren't optimal. So I've changed my text now, using your corrections, but still staying true to the original text.

Well, part of a good translation is to capture the meaning more than doing a literal translation.

Here are some notes:

1.	Wir haben gerade ein Märchen **der Gebrüder** Grimm gelesen  
-&gt;This is a more typical phrase. Just ""von Grimm"" sounds a bit hurried, although it isn't wrong. 

2.	Es handelt von einem kleinen Mädchen, **das** ganz allein auf der Welt ist  
-&gt;No way around that.

3.	Wir **erfahren**, dass die M**u**tter und der Vater tot sind, und dass sie arm ist  
-&gt;""Mütter"" is plural and while grammatically correct in itself, certainly wrong in the context since there's only one mother. Since you said, you read the story, ""hören"" is a bit out of context, unless someone reads the text aloud. I assume everyone reads the text alone.

4.	Obwohl sie nur wenig hat, ist sie dennoch freundlich und hilfsbereit
5.	Die Erklärung ist, dass sie fromm ist und **auf Gott vertraut**  
-&gt;I liked the suggestion ""auf Gott vertraut"", since being ""fromm"" and ""an Gott glauben"" is basically the same.

6.	Als sie einen armen Mann trifft, gibt sie **ihm** ein Stück Brot  
-&gt;Has to be like this.

7.	Einem armen Kind gibt sie ihr**e** Mütze, weil es so kalt ist  
-&gt;missing letter

8.	**Bevor** es ganz dunkel wird, hat **das** kleine Mädchen alles **verschenkt**  
-&gt;""wegschenken"" is not a very good word.  
The first part is ok, but I would phrase it a bit different. I don't like the ""ganz"".

9.	Während sie **da in dem dunklem Wald steht**, geschieht ein Wunder   
-&gt;Or, for emphasis of the ""Wald"": Während sie da steht**,** in dem dunklem Wald, geschieht ein Wunder

10.	Die Sterne fallen von de**m** Himmel und werden zu Münze**n**, so dass das kleine Mädchen sehr reich wird  
-&gt;No way around these two.

11.	So geschieht es, dass ihre Probleme~~n~~ gelöst werden  
-&gt;Otherwise wrong.

12.	Das Märchen endet damit, dass die Güte belohnt wird  
-&gt;Not wrong, but typically you would say ""ihre Güte"". Unless you want to say that ""Güte"" is rewarded universally.

13.	In der Romantik begannen die Dichter sich für alte~~m~~ Volk**s**märchen zu interessieren, aber in unserer **modernen** Welt ist man noch immer an Märchen interessiert  
-&gt; In the corrected version it's correct German, but bad phrasing because you would use ""interessieren"" two times close together.

14.	Die Märchen handeln so nicht mehr von Hexen und Drachen, **sondern** von psychologischen Problemen  
-&gt; Not sure about the context, but ""sondern"" is better here.

15.	Literaturwissenschaftler meinen, dass sie zum Be**i**spiel von **der** Entwicklung **des Kindes** **zum Erwachsenen** handeln.  
-&gt; You can't separate ""Entwicklung"" und ""des Kindes in this context. ""Leben"" is a bit strange here and it isn't in your English translation either.

One minute it belongs to you, the next without warning and against your will someone has taken it. It doesn't matter that it's legal, or maybe even necessary, it still fits the criteria. You'd still get pissed off if someone picked your pocket, even if it was to buy food.

It's not the same as an income tax, because most people don't budget according to their pre-tax income, what they receive is what they've earned and budget towards. It's not the same as an increase in VAT/sales tax, because it's added to the price and I can choose not to buy it, or switch to something cheaper. The money that's sat in my bank account is perceived to me to be no different to the money that's sat in my pocket. I earned it, and I paid tax on it, and what happens to it after that should be my decision.

In reality the difference between taxing what I have in the bank and Quantitive Easing (as has happened in the UK) is not huge, the figure my bank account displays stays the same, but now it's worth a percentage less, but one would piss me off because ""dammit I've already paid tax on that money, get your filthy hands out of my wallet"" and the other is ""oh well, the government are doing what they can for the economy as a whole and not taking from me directly"".

true,ValBazi,null,null,"&gt;this rating has been introduced quite some time ago, before that the highest rating was 16+, therefore the index was used for everything above that.

What do you mean by ""quite some time ago""? As long as I can remember (about 15 years into the past) there has always been a 18+ rating for movies and games. Maybe I'm just too young...

Anyway, I still think that it's the law's fault. Even if you're targeting adults, if your game gets on the index you can't do any advertisements at all. Also your game isn't allowed to sit in shelves. It can only be sold if the customer specifically asks for it. The game magazines can't do reviews of your game. All this means that the general public (people who don't go on foreign video-game websites, etc.) won't ever know that your game even exists. Ergo it won't sell.

From a consumer perspective this wasn't really a problem, because you could always import uncut-versions from Austria or UK. However, nowadays it becomes a problem, because online plattforms like Steam don't allow you to shop in another region's store by checking your IP- and Credit-Card address.

On a different story I'm not allowed to resell my games that are rated 18+ (not on the index) on eBay, because only companies are allowed to do that.

The taxes won't be that much (unless you earn really well - but that is not possible with 23 years (nether in germany nor in the US), the income is higher - it is the rent that really hurts you. It will be even more difficult for you scince you probably won't have a job yet. Try cities/suburbs with less rent cost (NOT munich, even if it is great city), inform yourself about the rent you are going to pay. Other living costs are realtively small - if you can cook (and do not eat meat every day...).

I do not know the specifics about a work permit ""Arbeitserlaubnis"" etc - but I do not think it is that difficult to get. If you seek a job, it will be difficult (unless you are very well trained), because low skill jobs won't be in english only - ether get fluent in german, or try for an area that has several english speaking jobs (Berlin). Or try the ""Bundesfreiwilligendienst"" (~""German community service""), the salery is low, but they pay your housing (and more, ask for details), and there are several job oppertunities avaliable in english. Inform yourself (if it is even avaliable for non german citizens) and keep it as a short term alternative (duration is about 1 year, most jobs probably hire in cycles, so watch the timing).

TL;DR: Yes, I know one, and she was successfull (but she was already fluent in english). It is certainly possible.

If you're there in December, I cannot emphasize enough how you HAVE to go to the Christmas market on the Champs, and the one at Montmarte. Go with cash and be prepared to have sensory overload and eat so much and drink a lot of vin chaud. The Christmas market is one of the best things you'll ever experience. 

Take advantage of the legal public drinking and go one evening and bring a bottle of champagne and sit on a blanket and watch the Eiffel Tower light up with a friend. 

Go to [Le Balbuzard Cafe] (http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d797181-Reviews-Le_balbuzard_cafe-Paris_Ile_de_France.html) in the 10eme arrondissement. This is a little hidden gem and I lived a 3min. walk from the place. I tried to eat there once a week. Their daily specials change daily and the owners are lovely. [This] (http://i.imgur.com/6sA90eL.jpg) was my last meal I had in Paris at that cafe. 800 gram steak with frites made in duck fat. I had 4 courses that night but I will never in my life forget that main course. 

Walk everywhere. It will be cold in December but trust me-- walk EVERYWHERE. The things you see are unforgettable. If you're in the 3eme, walk up Rue Du Temple and go to where it intersects Rue de Rivoli and see the giant BHV. That is a great meeting place in Paris. You meet anyone for anything and you say the BHV and everyone knows where it is. 

Fuck, I'm really drunk right now so it is hard to give suggestions that are more meaningful, but feel free to PM me if you'd like more suggestions and ideas of what you can do to better plan.

Legally it's kind of annoying. They are pretty strict with having documents in order and making sure you have enough money to live here, so you have to have a special bank account with an arbitrary amount of money to prove that you have enough to get by.

Overall, the move wasn't too bad. It took some getting used to but I wouldn't change my decision. I have had a lot of great experiences and I am currently finishing up grad school and looking for a job here, so let's hope that works out!

* Is the verb transitive or intransitive? (many of them are like english one, but you have to remember the exceptions)^1. If yes, don't use preposition at all for the object, if not you have to know the preposition, any cheat sheet online is ok to start, with time you'll understand what preposition is right and what is wrong.

* Is the name I'm attaching a preposition to masculine or feminine? Would I use an article? If yes, the preposition usually has that article embedded in itself. e.g. ""the mug is on the table"" ""La tazza è **sul** tavolo"" because you would say ""il tavolo"" so you have to use su + il = sul (see below). While you'd say ""sono a casa **di** Giovanni"" (I'm at Giovanni's house) because you can't use articles with people's name (you can't say ""il Giovanni"")

So you have 7 preposition: di, a, da, in, con, su, per, tra, fra and you mix them with articles where you would use an article in a sentence without the preposition. Note that *tra* and *fra* don't mix with articles. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/STfRDwY) you can find a good table about how to mix articles with prepositions (ignore the *s impura* part for now)

I feel that, having read your comment history, you enjoy a good debate. However, the majority of what you post comes across with an arrogant rudeness - which is unfortunate. The way you write makes it seem as if anyone's viewpoint other than your own is heresy (rather than another point of view) - and despite retorts and further counter-evidence you are unwavering in your position. In one respect I have to commend you for strong beliefs - and I do also respect anyone who uses good grammar and evidential reference to back up their points. 

But, whether or not someone is at odds with your points of view doesn't give you casus belli to be rude to them. I'm more than happy to debate my points of view against yours (and honestly this thread has been fun) but to face someone who is doing the internet equivalent of sticking their fingers in their ears and humming when a counter-argument is posted detracts from the quality of the discussion. 

I'm not wanting to be rude myself - I genuinely enjoy the intellectual discussions which can be generated on Reddit. I just thought I should point out how you generally come across and how perceptions of that are detracting from your arguments - even when they are strong ones.

Every country that has joined the EU has done so because they elected to do it, not because someone forced them to at the barrel of a gun.

&gt;The Daily Telegraph uncovered from declassified archives that the US directly financed the EU construction[1] as it would align Europe against totalitarian USSR.

How is this newsworthy? The ECSC was a European idea, not an American one. It happened to served American interests as well. Don't forget that the Marshall Plan, too, was devised in part to prevent socialist and communist groups from taking power in Western Europe in the early postwar period, and yet Europeans and Americans alike hold in it very high regard. None of this is surprising or new information. Just because integration served US interests in the Cold War doesn't mean it was a bad idea.

&gt;It's sad to think of it this way, but Europe enjoyed peace because there were enough thermonuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles that would lead to Mutually Assured Destruction in case of war, not thanks to some piece of paper.

What has been more responsible for keeping Europe at peace, integration or nuclear weapons? This is one of those questions we can never really answer, because both happened at the same time. Even so, integration didn't just help keep Europe at peace, it repaired Franco-German relations and brought Germany back into the fold. Nuclear weapons wouldn't have done that.

&gt;Europe is not fine today, it has the highest unenmployement rates, Greece never had such high unenmployment rates except just after WW2.

In relative terms, yes, it is fine. It is one of the richest and most stable and democratic regions in the world, with strong rule of law and high human development. High unemployment and economic contraction are infinitely better than total war. No one is denying that the EU is going through rough times, but I sure as hell would rather be unemployed than dead.

After all, this is about the common market, so it would be rather strange if financial products were to be excluded from that. What you are probably talking about are the measures that were decided between Euro member states recently. Since these are not EU but Eurozone regulations these obviously just apply to the Eurozone. 

And trade agreements? What is it with the current British obsession with trade agreements? Trade agreements are a prime example for where it is obviously better to be a bigger power - one of the main reasons the EU was created. A trade agreement that came fast doesn't say a whole lot - what you want is a *good* trade agreement. You also need the political power to enforce this agreement. Good luck for Switzerland trying to enforce anything against China. by the way: Much of the EU doesn't seem to have any problems exporting to China.  

You also don't seem to understand the mechanism of standards. Could Swiss companies produce according to half a dozen standards for their varying customers? Of course. But it would be sheer madness to do so. You would have to switch out production machines, change production cycles, have half a dozen different ways of documenting everything and the possibility of very costly errors would be extremely high. That's why companies usually stick to just one standard. And that's usually the biggest/most lucrative. There are many example where EU standards became de facto world standards because of this.

Your last point: There were countless referendums since the EU was created. They are called general elections. Face it: The people of continental Europe are far more positive about the EU than many British EU-sceptics think.

Well, I for one think that if it wasn't for the Americans to watch over you (and the French), the after war situation could have been much worse for Germany, because England isn't exactly well known for it's kindness and indulgence when invading other countries. America can tell one or two things about that, too. 

Although I really don't feel the need to explain myself ""as German"" (you really like to point that out, don't you), to you, one last comment on this: 

I'm German by being a late repatriate (had to look this one up) immigrant. Neither me nor any member of my familiy had an active role in Nazi Germany whatsoever. During WW2 my ancestors weren't even close to any war zones, let alone Germany itself. 

Still I am glad (not proud, big difference) to live in Germany and have my German nationality today. I like this country, and I like the people. I'm a member of a German generation, that is quite aware and shocked of what has happened in Nazi Germany. I don't think there is a big difference between how other nationalities see WW2 and Nazi Germany and how my generation sees it. **The only real problem I have is when some nationalist prick wants to make me ""as German"" personally responisble for what has happened 80 years ago.** It that case my general response is and will always be ""go, fuck yourself"". I will not forget the past and I will fight anytime to never let this happen again. But I refuse to take personal responsibility for it, just because I have a German passport.

You on the other hand seem to be someone still living in the glorious past (you won, we lost, yeah I get it, here have a cookie). You took u/Xuth rather humorous comment and made a big fucking fuss out of it for no obvious reason other than being a righteous prick. This bomb could have easily killed hundreds of people just like me that had nothing to do with the war.

We Germans understand why the bombs are here, and we accept this historic fact. Frankly it's no even a big deal if one is found. More business as usual. 

You know I'm really glad to see there are also other people on your side of the canal like u/Xuth which are starting to approach this topic in a fair and much more relaxed way. This is a foundation the future can be built upon. You, Sir are a dying species, which is a good thing.

&gt; You disgust me

I'd say there's a difference between the Marshall plan, an open financial support project, and the ECSC, a supranational project financed by the soon-to be CIA.

No, we're talking about the EU and how the Swiss aren't in it. Did the Swiss have to enforce the new bonus cap? No. My point still stands.

However, Switzerland did have a referendum last month which voted 67.9 percent in favour of allowing shareholders to veto executive pay proposals and banning big rewards for new and departing managers. They can do it better themselves.

&gt;Trade agreements are a prime example for where it is obviously better to be a bigger power - one of the main reasons the EU was created. A fast trade agreement usually doesn't do much, what you want is a good trade agreement. You also need the political power to enforce this agreement. Good luck for Switzerland trying to enforce anything against China.

I don't think you understand that the EU is protectionist and that the Swiss export quite a lot. The Chinese want Swiss goods and they didn't have to wait for the EU to decide for over a year. If the Swiss want cheap goods from china that other EU countries don't want us to have (cheap cars will be veto'd by France, etc) then they can.

&gt;You also don't seem to understand the mechanism of standards. Could Swiss companies produce according to half a dozen standards for their varying customers? Of course. But it would be sheer madness. You would have to switch out production machines, change production cycles, have half a dozen different ways of documenting everything and the possibility of very costly errors would be extremely high. That's why companies usually stick to just one standard. And that's usually the biggest/most lucrative.

You're saying I can't buy a swiss watch in the EU now? And that if I went to japan I couldn't buy the the *exact same* swiss watch? Despite differing standards? Oh, wait you can - here's proof:

What one standard are they sticking to? Their own, which is more than enough for other markets.

&gt;Your last point: There were countless referendums since the EU was created. They are called general elections. Face it: The people of continental Europe are far more positive about the EU than many British EU-sceptics think. In my rather large social circle I know exactly nobody who would like to see the EU fail.

Aside from the fundamental difference between a referendum and a general election. I don't think you really got the jist of my point. I don't want to see the EU fail, I want a different EU to the one that is here now.

I personally spent over 500 euros on german-made goods in 2012. I do not intend to do so again, if that is how your attitude will be.

**Honestly, Europe, why do you keep callng us Nazis?**

We were never *solely* responsible for the drastic austerity in your countries. There were other countries as well. The Netherlands with Wilders and Finland and lots and lots of others were in row with austerity and even demanded more and harder measures to be taken. Stop blaming only Germany for this.
Yes, we played a major role in putting together ESM, Troika, etc etc. But what we did was more like brokering a compromise than inventing ways to torment the southern states because we are ""oh so evil"". If anything, we made things go forward by continuing to beg Holland, Finland and the likes to even sit on a table with you southerners.

Yes, the austerity measures are hard on you. But you need to understand that *democratic politics only move with pressure*. In my opinion Greece is the best example. After joining the Euro, as I gathered, they had years of time with cheap interest rates and lots of grant money to build up something sustainable. Did they do it when they had time, money, and quiet? No! What was and is needed is brute force to *make them* reform.
If you don't like that example, take another one. Germany was about to do its Energiewende (Energy transition) in slow fashion that was hindered by lobbyists and big industries everywhere. It took the pressure from Fukushima to *make them* accept to actually do something now.

Yes, Germany gains from a more integrated EU. So that may be why we are relentlessly pushing forward EU authority. But you, dear other states, you gain from this as well.

The other sign says ""my pension is only 200 euros"", which I don't think is true, but nevertheless there are hundreds of thousands of people with less than a 500 euros pension. So the libertarian party (of all) did some calculation that said if we were to re-distribute the budget we could get every single pensioner a 700-750 euro pension (and they posed this socialist idea in their pre-election campaign)

The above means that someone is abusing the pension system, guess who, the syndicalists from the DEKO (state owned) companies who including the bonuses tricks and whatever else they made up were making even 3* that amount. So why aren't people getting irrate against them and just call Merkel a Nazi? WHat if they thenselves are stirring it up, to cover their asses. Cause everytime you are about to complain about that clique of political clients and the places they work, someone's going to bring up ""socialism"" or nationalism or merkel being hitler and in the end the whole thing remains taboo.

Where did you get this info?

I can well imagine that it would be many small screens, because that is cheaper. But having many cameras would make the perspective not only off for close objects but essentially all objects not in a certain fixed distance to the screen. The Eiffel Tower for example would be visible in many small versions on every screen (or let's say in every camera picture).

To fix that you would need something like an orthographic camera. But outside of computer graphics that doesn't exist as far as I know. Also, the Eiffel Tower would not be visible at all in the background (because it's bigger than the screen).

Or you need one camera for the whole thing (which would be the most feasible solution), but then you need a certain distance to the camera and the screen (unless it's transparent from the back side, which doesn't sound feasible to me)

This is because he's considered a hero. Maybe I can try to explain why. He said this in 1991:

&gt; ""This, what you are doing, is not good. This is the path that you want to take Bosnia and Herzegovina on, the same highway of hell and death that Slovenia and Croatia went on. Don't think that you won't take Bosnia and Herzegovina into hell, and the Muslim people maybe into extinction. Because the Muslim people cannot defend themselves if there is war here.""

Sounds pretty brutal, right? It is until you realize that for Yugoslavia's successor state (Serbia), all peaceful solutions were shot down by Bosnia. When a country is trying to keep its sovereign identity, and all avenues of peaceful solutions have been exhausted... what do you do? What would a country do today? Just try to picture this in your head.

This was the situation Bosnian Serbs found themselves in. They didn't want to be a part of a new country, they wanted to stay. So, let me ask you, what would you do? Well, what they decided to do was use force, and its thanks to Mladić and the Dayton Accord that Republika Srpska exists in Bosnia today.

From a [PwC document](http://www.pwc.com/im/en/assets/document/The_REIT_answer_is_the_Isle_of_Man.pdf)

&gt; **Why establish a REIT offshore?**

&gt;There are a number of advantages to establishing a REIT 
outside of the UK, in a tax-neutral jurisdiction.

&gt; Firstly, shares in an offshore REIT are not ‘UK situs’ and 
will not therefore form part of the investor’s UK estate for 
Inheritance Tax purposes.

&gt; Secondly, individuals who are resident but not domiciled 
in the UK can invest in UK property via an offshore REIT 
without triggering a ‘remittance’for UK income tax and 
capital gains tax purposes.

&gt; Thirdly, if a new REIT is in a start up phase, all of the 
necessary corporate transactions to put the initial portfolio 
in place can be done in a tax neutral environment before 
the company migrates to the UK from that jurisdiction,
applies for REIT status and becomes listed on a recognised 
exchange.

&gt; However, because an IoM company is always treated as 
tax resident here, it cannot be used as a REIT. This is why 
we asked the government to consider changing the law.
Assuming this change goes through, the IoM will 
immediately become the jurisdiction of choice for the 
establishment of offshore REITs for a number of very good 
reasons",0,1365085130,null,0,false,0,c98cay3,t3_1bnh1w,t1_c98cay3,t1_c98c4vj,null,1431676198,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

are also owned via offshore structures where it is impossible to identify the owners.

true,[deleted],null,null,"If you're a somewhat safe diver (I assume you had a sufficient number of driving lessons), there's no need to worry. What the examiners are looking for is for the general skill to drive a car safely around the streets, they don't expect you to be perfect.

1. Don't panic if you mess up. If you do something wrong, keep your calm, and don't try to make it right by doing illegal maneuvers.
For example, 2 minutes into my driving exam, I got into the wrong lane. The examiner told me to follow the Bundesstraße (which was turning right), however I got in the lane that went straight ahead. The wrong thing would have been trying to wiggle me into the right lane, crossing a  continuous line. Instead, I just announced that I got in the wrong lane, that I will continue straight ahead, and will try to make a U-turn as soon as possible. The examiner had no problem with that, and at the end of the exam, he actually said that I handled the situation very well.

2. Don't do any risky maneuvers. You don't have to prove that you are an expert driver, you have to prove that you can handle a car in a safe manner. However, don't drive too pasive / fearful. You have to show that you won't hold up traffic, so for example if you have to merge into a street, don't wait until there is no car to bee seen, just wait until you have a big enough gap to merge without endangering anyone.

3. As courtmast0r said, overdo things like holding at a stop sign, Schulterblick etc. It shows the examiner that you actually understand what you are doing.

4. Don't participate in the small talk between your examiner and your instructor - my instructor specifically told me that before the exam. They will usually start chatting, and if you listen to that, and try to participate, you will get distracted. Try to focus on your driving.

5. If you aren't sure what the examiner wants you to do, or if you didn't understand an instruction by the examiner, ask instead of doing something stupid. For example, If you can only go left or right, and you didn't get an instruction where to drive, ask what to do.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"I prepared a summary of the main points, so you won't need to read 20 pages to participate in the discussion:

&gt; What was the lesson that we economists ought to have learnt from the experience of the 1920s and 30s?   It   is   very   simple,   when   you   have   an   attempt   to   create   a   common   currency  – the   gold standard of the time, the Euro now, or to fix exchange rates as the Bretton Woods era; unless you introduce with the fixed exchange rate regime a mechanism for recycling surpluses through a 
degree of political planning, the markets are not going to do it for you. 

&gt; As   long   as   there   are   disparities   between   different   regions   or   countries   in   that   fixed   currency world; and as long as there are disparities in the degree of capital utilisation, in oligopoly power, in   the   development   of   the   capital   goods   sector   as   opposed   to   the   consumption   goods   sector, there will be huge flows of capital flowing from the surplus to the deficit countries. These will not be helping the deficit countries to catch up in terms of productivity enhancement. Instead, they will be driving asset prices up and creating the circumstances for a crash like that of 1929. When 
the crash happens, as in 1929 and 2008, the immediate repercussion is firstly the fixed exchange rate system begins to unravel as it did with Britain leaving the Gold Standard in 1931; and as the Euro zone is unravelling, despite the best efforts of Mr Draghi today.

&gt; The new dealers were painfully aware of these facts as the world was exiting the Second World War. This is why we had the golden era of capitalism between the late 1940s and 1971 under the 
Bretton Woods system, which I prefer to refer to as the ‘global plan’, because there was a lot more to it than just the Bretton Woods system. [...] The new dealers understood   that   you   do   need   fixed   exchange   rates   or predictable exchange rates to facilitate trade, such as the Gold Standard. But to leave it at that, 
without   a   surplus   recycling   mechanism,  means   that   you  are   creating   the   circumstances   for   a  massive      depression.  And    they   were   very   keen    to  ensure    that  they   would  recreate   a  Gold Standard-like fixed exchange rate regime with a surplus recycling mechanism implanted in the core. [...] 

&gt; The Americans [...] said “It is our surplus, we’ll recycle it anyway we like”. Therefore between 1948 and 1968 around 70% of American profits were recycled into Germany, into Europe and crucially into Japan. It was not a case of philanthropy; it was a case of pragmatism and an attempt to prevent the collapse that we had in 1929 rearing its ugly head again. [...]

&gt; But by the late 1960s the Americans lost their surpluses and it was inevitable that this system could    no   longer   continue. [...] Paul Volker’s idea, which he implemented when he became Chairman of the Fed, was that if the US could not recycle its own surplus, because it did not have any,   then  it  may  as  well  recycle  other  people’s  surpluses.   This   is   precisely   what   happened between   the   late   1970s   and   2008.

&gt; The   US   implemented   a   number of policies [...] [which] ensured that the surplus nations’ profits would voluntarily gush into Wall Street to the tune of 3bn USD and 5bn USD net, every working day, and Wall Street would in turn use that in order to finance corporations and the US Treasury, as well as to provide credit to the American consumer who kept buying the net exports of the net exporters. 

&gt; What do bankers do if you give them 3-5bn USD to play with even if it is only for 10 minutes? The answer is they find ways of making it breed for themselves – it is what we call financialisation. On the back of this tsunami of capital between the 1980s and the late 2000s, we had the creation and build-up of what Keynes referred to as “a  bubble   on   a   whirlpool   of   speculation.”  This  turbo-charged   the   3-5bn   USD   per   day   by   a   factor between   70   or   80   by   2006. [...]

&gt; In   2008,   the   pyramids of      private      money  minted   by Wall   Street, in the city of London in  particular, and consumed        with   gusto by    the    German      and French      banks,    before 
being     sent   on   to  the periphery       to    create bubbles   there,   burned down.  

&gt; [...] The term [debt crisis] is an analytically unhelpful      term     that softens      us   up    and 
prepares          us      to accept     a    creditors’  agenda at a time of a debt deflationary crisis which is, in the end, bad for the creditors themselves [...] We cannot understand the reasons why the recession and the global uncertainty refuse to be lifted until we understand that there is a problem of a broken down recycling mechanism. We have had two mechanisms since the Second World War, they are both gone, and we do not have a clue today as to how to replace them. Until and unless we do, there will be a hefty human cost involved throughout the breadth and width of our planet. What we need is a gestalt shift.

true,Thetonn,ENGL,England,"When German reunification was first mooted, Margaret Thatcher was strongly opposed to it, foreseeing perceptions like this. The point is that Germany is the most powerful state there is in Europe politicLly, economically and demographically. Other nations in Europe saw this as a threat in the earlier twentieth century, and sought to limit Germany first through war and secondly through partition and economic interdependence.

The whole point of the two world wars was to stop powerful Central European powers from overriding the wishes of smaller states and their nationalist movements. That is why people make comparisons to the nazis, because they see a direct parallel between a centralised Europe imposing laws and economic dictates onto them and the autocratic nature of Nazism.

Granted, there are massive problems with this viewpoint, and I definitely do not subscribe to it, but that's why people have this reaction. The idea that the problems were caused by someone else and that the Germans are imposing something bad onto the people against their will brings up the tropes of resistance and opposition.

Basically, yes, these people are wrong, but they are wrong for cultural and historic reasons which will not be dealt with by telling them that they have hurt your feelings. Instead, you need to either reassure them of their national sovereignty or explain more effectively why Germany does what it does not to politicians or to the international community but to the people you are imposing austerity on.

&gt; Why can’t markets sort out this mess? Well we never really had a reason to believe that they could. As economists we  should  be  weary  of  the  limits  of  our  ‘science’.  We  should  understand  that  since  Adam Smith,   we   have   spectacularly   failed   to   create   logically   coherent   models   which   managed   to  account simultaneously for complexity and for time. [...]

&gt; In designing fiscal consolidation programmes after 2008 for example, the great and the good in various organisations, this one included, have assumed Ricardian equivalence. David Ricardo’s equivalence was based on the corn model, on a single commodity world. We know that a world with many commodities does not behave like the corn model.  ‘We’re damned if we know’, as Keynes might have said, whether Ricardian equivalence would hold up in such a world. We use 
Cobb-Douglas production functions in order to advise governments; in other words, we create a model of the world in which every country resembles an electricity generator with a well defined function linking inputs and outputs. Then we claim to be telling politicians that these pieces of advice are scientific – this is a complete and utter flight from reason, straight into the embrace of pure faith. 

&gt; [...] We as economists extracted immense social power from our models. That social power had nothing to do with the truth stages of our theories but instead it reflected the extent to which we could solve our models and close them. But to close those models we had to introduce hidden axioms 
which guaranteed that they would be irrelevant vis-à-vis capitalism. So the more irrelevant our models were, the greater our discursive power, within the corridors of power.",0,1365089701,null,0,false,0,c98dr5o,t3_1bntvs,t1_c98dr5o,t3_1bntvs,null,1431675443,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,Rarehero,null,null,"The Nazis were a minority. A large minority, but still a minority, and they only came to power because of a fucked up political system and the misjudgment and weakness of the oppositional democratic parties, who thought they could isolate Hitler as chancellor. If the democratic system would have been a little bit stronger - mind you that Germany was still a very young democracy back then - Hitler might have never came to power. The final act in Hitlers takeover was a political antic behind closed doors.

And the Germans did not welcome the war. The Nazis, yes, but not the majority of Germany, although the victory over France marks the peak of Hitlers popularity (even then he had no majority behind him). However, it's difficult to tell what the Germans thought back then since there was no freedom of opinion and having the wrong opinion could have caused many problems for you and your family. The measures of terror the Nazis have applied in the countries they have occupied were else applied in Germany.

Another thing you have to understand about the German army and the war is that by far not every Wehrmacht-soldier was a Nazi or fighting for the Nazis. Many soldiers were fighting because they didn't want their 'Vaterland' to be occupied by enemy forces and because the didn't want another 'Versailles Treaty' forced on their country. 

Now let's get back to the carpet bombings of German cities: Carpet bombings are simply inhuman. There's a reason why we have weapons today that can destroy a single target from a distance of several hundred kilometers without destroying the nearby school or hospital. The carpet bombings have killed countless innocent people without leading to a quicker end of the war. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't want to play down the German role in 'Third Reich'. That would be stupid. Many million people died at the hands of the Germans. There's nothing to play down. I want a more differentiated of the things that during the 'Third Reich'. Saying that all or most Germans back then were Nazis or supported the Nazis is not only wrong, it's also dangerous since coming from that view on things it's is easy to say that all modern Germans are secretly Nazis as well. And one thing we should have learned from World War II is that you don't judge people by their ethnic or religious background.

Plus, there is no ""hour of informatics"" scheduled, so the kids wouldn't have the time needed to use computers in school. And that time needs to be scheduled at a State level. No chance to do it locally, let alone as a school. Kids do not choose sujects in Italy, they choose the type of school.

The administrative staff in every school is also very little, and the budget they have even smaller. So no chance to let it pass as an ""extra activity"".

Sono per l'appunto  leggende, ci vogliono competenze e macchinari che non sono alla portata di tutti, e chi li ha potrebbe a quel punto costruirsi direttamente l'arma. In alcuni casi poi le armi nascono direttamente come semiauto (cioè non sono armi ex militari modificate) e la modifica del pacchetto di scatto è impossibile. Per esempio, le armi automatiche usate dalla criminalità organizzata in Italia non sono armi civili modificate, ma armi da guerra vere e proprie introdotte clandestinamente in Italia. Comunque grandissima parte dei crimini, in Italia come negli USA, avviene con l'impiego di pistole, che nessuno si sogna di bandire. 

&gt;Poi personalmente i cacciatori che conosco hanno la doppietta caricata a pallini, per gli uccelletti da polenta; ma anche le doppiette non le trovi ne' alla standa ne' alla coop..

Giusto, ma considera che negli ultimi anni è esplosa la moda della caccia al cinghiale, perché ce ne sono troppi e danneggiano le coltivazioni (i danni li paga la collettività). Con una doppietta caricata a pallini al cinghiale gli fai il solletico, ci vogliono munizioni a palla unica, spesso sparate da armi a canna rigata. In Italia le armi che hai indicato nei tuoi link (a parte quella in .22lr, che è un calibro troppo piccolo), sono in genere utilizzabili a caccia, a parte eccezioni che sono troppo noiose per essere elencate qui.

Concentrate on following the rules not on pleasing the examiner.

If he tells you to turn left but you can`t because you have to change lanes and you can`t change lanes in time without cutting off another car then do not do it.  Just drive on and tell him why you couldn`t take the turn.


Do nothing that is not especially asked for. Doing extra things will not get you any bonus points, it will only create chances where you can make mistakes.
I.e. During my exam when I was on the Autobahn I stuck to the right lane. He didn`t ask me to overtake a car so I didn`t.

Do not drive too slowly as this is also a reason to not pass.

Overdo everything (Schulterblick , Stopschild,  Bahnübergang ,Busüberholung) so he will 100% notice that you did those things.

Try to park very slowly.  If you are very slow and you hit the Bordstein  you will not drive onto it. Driving up the bordstein will make you fail but just hitting it will not.

As someone that lived most of his life in Slavic countries, I can say that Romania is more Slavic than Latin. The language, mentality, music, political culture. humor, folk art are more similar to Russia, Bulgaria and Hungary than to Italy or France.

&gt; as well as the fact that while these areas (Bulgaria for example) was actually occupied by the Ottomans for quite a while, Romania wasn't. 

That's just not true, Wallachia and Moldova was an Ottoman vassal between the 15th and 19th century, with some brief moments of freedom or other dominance. If you look at the pictures of rulers of Wallachia, you'll see some of them even dress in Ottoman style. Romania wasn't politically independent until the treaty of San Stefano. 

&gt; It was a vassal and the influence was much smaller.

How do you know what was the influence of Turkish culture on the Serbs, Greeks or Albanians? I can tell you that a people living in the plains (Romanians, Hungarians), where there is not much natural defense, are much more easily influenced by a foreign culture than people living in the hills (Serbs, Albanians, Greeks).

&gt; It can even be observed today, for example, 10% of Bulgaria is muslim of Turkish origin. Romania has no muslim influences and has the lowest number of muslims in the whole of Europe.

Current population figured don't mean anything. You should rather check how many Muslims were living in Romania in 1600.

&gt; Politically it was never involved in the so-called ""Balkan wars""

It participated in the war against Bulgaria!

&gt; nor did it have any conflicts with any of the neighbors.

wtf? 

&gt; So, as it stands now, Romania is no more a Balkan country, just because it borders the Balkans, than say, Hungary.

Vado. arrivo. attendo. attendo. attendo. parlo con qualcuno e vedo una fotocpia di sto cazzo di verbale. Classica multa ""sei senza biglietto compare"", ma manca la mia firma.

""eh ma ha il suo numero di documento"", dice l'omino ATM. 

""Eh ma di multe ne ho prese, eh, e le ho pure pagate, siccome tenete le copie, quanto sarebbe difficile per voi recuperarne una a inizio blocchetto e replicare?"" rispondo. 

""eh sarebbe illegale però eh!"" mi risponde. ""comunque è tutto in mano ad equitalia. deve parlare con loro"".

richiamo equitalia. spiego. se ne sbattono con la forza di un dio infuriato.

""e se le dimostro che non c'ero? che ero altrove? che lavoravo?"" chiedo.

""ah beh in quel caso la multa rimane sospesa fino a che non riusciamo ad accertarcene"".

""scusi come ve ne accertate?"" chiedo curioso. 

""eh dipende lei cosa ci dice..."" dice vagamente il tale.

""ma scusi - gli dico io un po' alterato - ma voi nemmeno potete dimostrare che C'ERO!""

""ma abbiamo la multa!""

""ma non l'ho firmata! potrebbe essere un falso!""

While Romania and Albania do have differences when it comes to cultural aspects they do have several similarities. Both of them were tightly controlled by paranoid dictators that refused to join with Yugoslavia and the citizens of both countries suffered terribly under those regimes. As much as Albania is touted as a Muslim country religion plays virtually no role in society as religion was banned for the duration of Enver Hoxha's regime. Albanians are also not of Slavic descent and have more in common with the ancient Illyrians which inhabited the region before the Romans came. Just as the Romanians have Vlad the Impaler as a national hero for fighting against the Turks, the most famous national hero in Albania is Skanderbej who fought against the Turks for 25 years or so. Shqip, aka Albanian, is also on a seperate branch on the language tree from Slavic languages and actually has some ties to Latin based languages. Also the Vlach people settled in both Romania and Albania and the language is still spoken in both countries.

(esempio classico i thread LOL FEMNAZI WANTED ME TO PAY FOR OUR DATE HURR; Nascondo un fondo in cui la critica è che il femminismo propone eguaglianza, ma alcune femministe vorrebbero uguaglianza+""diritti"" acquisiti dal gentil sesso, creando dunque una sorta di diseguaglianza forzata; in questo campo rientrerebbero anche le quote rosa e simili agevolazioni nel mondo professionale).

&gt;As someone that lived most of his life in Slavic countries, I can say that Romania is more Slavic than Latin. The language, mentality, music, political culture. humor, folk art are more similar to Russia, Bulgaria and Hungary than to Italy or France.

Nothing personal, but I take it from this response that you haven't done a lot of travelling, I would say that Romania is more latin with some slavic mixed in.

&gt;That's just not true, Wallachia and Moldova was an Ottoman vassal between the 15th and 19th century

True, but they were able to exercise a very high degree of autonomy compared to other regions under the ottoman empire.

&gt; You should rather check how many Muslims were living in Romania in 1600.

If there was a significant Muslim population, there would definately be some signs left of it through history, yet there isn't

Romania's participation, which was only during the 2nd part, was quite insignificant compared to the rest of the war.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, for a start there are some good tutorials on youtube for homemade jerky (some with oven, some with a dehydrator) and you can move on from there. 

I usually order 2-3kg beef soup meat (somewhat the cheapest part of a cow) at my local butcher at €8-9/kg and since i'm such a good customer he makes sure its the leanest bit so little to no fat. I then cut it up at home in smaller pieces slightly bigger than a normal steak and remove fatty spots if there are any (very important because fat wont dehydrate and will make your jerky go bad). Put them in the freezer and wait for the meat to go hard but not fully frozen, this will make it easier to cut thin slices of jerky. 

Prepare a bowl of marinade of your choice, lots of good recipes to be found online. I take olive oil, worcestershire sauce, little bit of aceto balsamico, onion powder, salt (don't be afraid to add alot, it will make it preserve better) &amp; pepper and random spices. Stir it up and add the jerky slices, knead the meat so the marinade gets spread nicely and put everything in a ziplock bag for some hours (i usually let it rest a night in the fridge). 

Take the bag out, pour everything in a sieve. Then i take some kitchen paper and put the jerky slices on it so excess marinade is absorbed. All you need to do then is put the slices on the grill of your oven or if you have alot of meat just put them on satésticks and let them hang on the grill. Put the oven on the lowest mode you have (mine is around 50 °C) and wait 4-6 hours. Let it cool down and you have yourself some homemade jerky. 

It's experimenting at first to get everything right to your taste but practice makes perfect. I use pork aswell (seems like those Americans don't fancy that) as long as it's not too fat, tastes equally as good, is cheaper here but the texture of the meat is somewhat less 'stringy'. I prefer to make my pork jerky like spareribs, it's like barbeque at winter. If you're really serious about it you can also buy a hydrator, a bit expensive though. Make sure to provide enough ventilation when you're making jerky, if you have a dog he/she will go crazy. I prefer homemade jerky to the store stuff as i know what goes in it, American jerky tends to have tons of sugar and additives. Just make sure to have good hygiene when preparing the meat as jerky is uncooked.

Hope this helps you. :)

There is also no time when nobody needs energy! Pump storage of energy is a reliable possibility to ""store"" energy and use it later.

Is the switch to renewable energy in Germany perfect? I don't think so. But it is time to look at it from all sides. The German industry learned a lot about solar, wind and biomass. New technologies are being built and sold all over the world. 

Nuclear fission is heavily subsidized and we don't control the technology on all levels. There is always human error or mother nature. A contaminated environment and a forced relocation of tens of thousands of people in Japan is nothing we should accept in the year 2013! 

Nuclear fission is easy and a sweet way to generate energy but we can't exclude a disaster. Therefore a densely populated country like Germany had to search for alternatives.

So here's a list of what we colonized:

* Transylvania - our ""homeland"" used to be half-inhabited by Romanians (highlands), half by Hungarians (lowlands); in 1240, the Mongols massacrated the people in the lowlands (mostly Hungarians) and Romanians were able to fill the vacuum quickly; the ethnic makeup has been kept since.
* Wallachia and Moldavia -- they were inhabited by Slavs, Romanians from the Carpathians assimilated the local Slavs living in the plains
* Greece, Albania, Macedonia -- some high mountains colonized are a branch of the Romanians called ""[Aromanians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromanians)""/""Vlachs"" who speak a language related to Romanian; they probably colonized those areas around 1000 AD; many have been assimilated as Greeks, Macedonians, etc during the last 100 years.
* Slovakia, Czech Republic -- we colonized some mountainous areas in what's now [Moravian Wallachia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravian_Wallachia) and some parts in Slovakia; they were assimilated, but they still eat [Bryndza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryndza)
* Croatia -- the [Istro-Romanians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istro-Romanians) reached Istria peninsula. they were assimilated mostly during the last 200 years, there are only a few villages where they still speak a dialect of Romanian.
* Bosnia -- we're proud to say that we've done our part in creating the mish-mash of ethnicities in Bosnia, our settlers helping the Serbian side become mix with the locals
* Ukraine -- actually, the almost-barren steppe was [colonized by the Russians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Serbia_(historical_province)); they wanted to attract Serbs, but most of the people who showed up were Romanians from Transylvania and Moldavia.

There is always a certain tension in international relationships balancing between breaking all ties with somewhat dictator Kabila and the other extreme of being neo-colonialists. We still have a big Congolese community in [Brussels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixelles#Matong.C3.A9), a lot of political exiles go there  (for example Tshisekedi). We don't really give a lot of attention to the history of our monarchs, they were never popular. Leopold II is commonly known as the one with the beard. Couple of years ago a politician did get his fair share of spanking after he described Leopold II as a  ['hero for the country'](http://afroeurope.blogspot.be/2010/06/mep-louis-michel-says-king-leopold-ii.html), served him well. The debate is far from dead, a [very well writen book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo:_A_History) of the history of Congo went bestseller and recieved critical acclaim. 

As far as education goes, we learn about the history and the major events, the good and obviously the bad things. The main sentiment is mostly that the atrocities committed were for the bigger part the fault of Leopold II, it was his 'playgarden'. A part of the civilizing mission has remained in explaining the positives of colonization, we educated them and gave them healthcare. The schools and hospitals were run by the Catholic church, most schools and hospitals here in Belgium still are, in a time it was a rarity for a family in Belgium to not have a priest in the family.
