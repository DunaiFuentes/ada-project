Men, White people, Heterossexual people set the oppressive normative standards of our society. Attacking these groups does not qualify as oppressive speech and is not equivalent to attacking oppressed groups. Asians have been historically oppressed groups in several parts of the world, including France during colonial times. People who even looked like japanese were incarcerated in the United States during the Pacific War. When you look at someone, and look down on them just because of their race, which is what we talked about and what AtheistAgnostic brought here, is, according to me, part of oppressive speech. Mind you, this has nothing to do with offensive speech.


Oppressive speech, I give you this, is often done out of ignorance. But that doesn't mean we as a society shouldn't crack down on it.

The song placed badly because it was bad. It was an obvious attempt to copy Loreen and it lacked everything. I actually went to fetch beer. 

Why do we have to care so much about Eurovision? The purpose of the ESC is to have fun together, to enjoy the unique diversity this continent offers and to amuse oneself about the more crazy contestants (Hi Romania). Germany really doesn't need to win this thing. Germany is one of the most powerful nations on this planet. We are even good at football. We don't need to win the ESC, more so not ""at any cost"". Hell, we even won three years ago. That's gotta be good for the next 20 years in my book. Doesn't mean we don't try to send good songs there, but if the German entry fares poorly (because it is poor), then what the heck? Can we not just relax and enjoy the show? I do understand when the crazier tabloids publicly mull about the supposed post-USSR-connection (read: neighboring countries voting for each other, in particular in post-soviet states), because that is what crazy tabloids do. But I expect such a seasoned commentator as Urban to see that such remarks are really damaging Germany's battered reputation and that they really do not offer any helpful insight at all. I hope he was just joking.

Next week some crazy FDP politician will probably demand that Greece pass half their points to Germany as long as we are ""helping"" them...

I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Looking down on someone because of race is plain racism. What I was contesting is that resorting to pop culture cliches or not knowing the nationality of an Asian guy is not racism.

Calling ignorance oppressive speech sounds counter-productive to me as it is not done with an intention to oppress, and the people being ignorant might not be privileged themselves at all.

Finally I don't like that you seem to imply that white heterosexual men are oppressive in nature and that it is ok to attack them. What kind of attacks are you refering to? And we could't criticize a gay man or a woman if he/she's oppressive to people? It seems like an oversimplification of a very complex problem.

Racial theories try to separate humans into universal distinct groups. This has several problems. Genetic, cultural and geographic borders don't really match up. Neighboring groups normally overlap and there are many people that would fit in multiple groups. For dog breeds you can easily say which race a dog is. Also the genetic difference between individuals in a supposed human race is way bigger than between supposed human races.

Ce qui m'arrange bien, ça me permet d'étudier chez eux malgré mon allemand douteux - je suis à peu près capable de suivre un amphi en allemand, faire un exam, ya pas moyen. (Cela dit, inversement, beaucoup de nos exams ont en première page 'Vous pouvez répondre en anglais ou en allemand.')

Cause ou conséquence, ya à peu près 30-40% d'étudiants internationaux en master chez nous ; bon, évidemment, dans ceux-là il y a pas mal de germanophones, mais ça reste pas négligeable. Et c'est plutôt chouette d'être en cours avec des gens d'un peu partout. 

Les profs et les assistants ont tous plus ou moins d'accent et/ou de tournures parfois étranges (je suis pas sûre d'avoir vu grand'monde qui parle nativement anglais, en fait), les étudiants aussi, mais de manière générale on se comprend sans problème. Et si le prof et l'étudiant sont tous les deux germanophones, les questions qui viennent à la fin du cours ou pendant la pause se font souvent en allemand, et c'est pas vraiment un problème non plus... c'est pas histoire de parler anglais ""artificiellement"" pour le plaisir de parler anglais, c'est histoire de pouvoir communiquer avec un maximum de monde à la fois. Ce qui me semble pas être un but aberrant pour l'enseignement. 

Et comme dit plus haut, la recherche scientifique est en anglais, ya pas à sortir de là, et pour le coup c'est pas forcément plus mal d'avoir la même terminologie, on gagne du temps. (Je me souviens avoir fait le lien tardivement entre la notion de ""corps"" et de ""field"" (je touche aux maths), ça m'a un peu agacée ;) ). Cela dit, c'est probablement plus flagrant au niveau master qu'à la sortie du bac.

Bref, à titre personnel,  je ne vois pas aucun inconvénient à l'anglais comme langue d'enseignement supérieur, bien au contraire. Quant au fait que ce soit carrément interdit, je dois dire que je tombe des nues. Bon, après, il me semble évident que tout étudiant arrivant en cursus supérieur devrait, de nos jours, avoir un niveau d'anglais permettant de suivre des cours en université, éventuellement en gardant la possibilité de rédiger les exams en français.

Hallo! Können Sie mir bitte mit mit meinem Deutsch helfen? [sehr formal, aber aber hier auf Reddit können wir uns sicherlich auch einfach duzen -&gt; Könnt ihr mir bitte mit meinem Deutsch helfen]

Ich möchte mich gerne vorstellen und über mich auf Deutsch reden. Danke vielmals.

Hallo, ich heiße Aliocha. Ich bin 18 Jahre alt und [ich bin] Studentin. (beides ist korrekt, aber schicker und natürlicher ist es, die Wiederholung wegzulassen). Ich studiere Deutsch und Buchhaltung. Ich wohne in Burnaby, in British Columbia. Burnaby ist in der Nähe von Vancouver. (Wenn deine Tastatur keine Umlaute unterstützt, kannst du sie ersetzen. Ä wird zu Ae, ä zu ae, ü zu ue, ö zu oe, ß zu ss etc. - aber du solltest niemals die ""Punkte"" einfach weglassen - vermutlich weißt du das aber bereits und es war ein einfacher Fehler :-) ). Das Wetter ist heute sehr schön! Die Sonne scheint, aber es ist nicht zu heiß.

Ich wohne in Burnaby, in British Columbia. (das hast du aber gerade eben schon gesagt ;-) ) Ich LIEBE Burnaby! (kein ""French spacing"", bitte) Ich finde es sehr schön und groß. Das Wetter ist auch schön, aber es regnet hier oft. Ich wohne mit meiner Freundin zusammen. (if she's your friend who is a girl, I'd probably say ""einer Freundin"" or ""meiner besten Freundin"" instead of ""meiner Freundin"" to make that clear since German doesn't have a distinctive term like ""girlfriend"". If she is your girlfriend and you're in a relationship, then ""meiner Freundin"" is great, but it allows for both interpretations.) Sie ist auch eine Ringerin. Wir leben im Keller eines schönen Hauses in einer guten Nachbarschaft/Wohngegend. Meine Hauswirte sind ein alter italienischer Mann und eine alte italienische Frau (since the grammatical case differs for both here, repetition is needed - if they are a couple, you could have just said ""ein altes italienisches Paar"" or ""Ehepaar"" if they are married).
Meine Mitbewohnerin und ich teilen sich die Küche, das Bad und das Wohnzimmer aber wir haben separate Schlafzimmer. Es ist sehr leicht, sich in Burnaby zu bewegen. Ich benutze den Skytrain und den Bus.

true,ciaran036,null,null,"Things are going fine. 

We still have roughly around half of our politicians classing themselves as nationalists -those that want unification with Ireland, and the other half classing themselves as unionists - those that want to remain in the United Kingdom. Independence isn't really a consideration by anyone really. I think most people are content (I wouldn't use the word 'happy') with the devolved government at Stormont, and everything else being ruled from London (and to an extent by our representatives in Brussels). 

Irish nationalists aren't pushing too far though and I think generally most people are comfortable with the way things are, belonging to the union. Recently, politicians agreed a plan by which they hope to knock down all the 'peace walls' that divide communities in Northern Ireland (mostly in Belfast) within 10 years. 

Polls indicate that a majority of those who identify themselves as Catholics (traditionally nationalists) don't even want a united Ireland any more. 

*Most* people are fine the way things are. Economically things are mixed, some areas experiencing high levels of economic inactivity and unemployment, whilst at the same time the tourism industry has been doing quite well, there have been plenty of new jobs created in the IT industry, some manufacturing businesses have won some big contracts and the film-making industry has kicked up a big notch (a number of big TV and movie productions have filmed here, notably the Game of Thrones series which has based its main studios here in Belfast). 

On social issues, unfortunately we still have old fogies in power, so no progress in terms of things like abortion and gay marriage legislation. 

Right now, there are two groups of people who are of concern to the continuing peace process: 

1) Dissident Republicans - There are several small factions who united together last year. In the past 5 years, these groups have been responsible for a number of bombings and shootings, generally targeting the security forces (police and army), but they also bombed 2 banks in Derry, and also the offices of the UK City of Culture company in protest that Derry was designated by the British as the 'UK City of Culture' for 2013 (a designation which is bringing about increased levels of tourism and economic activity, and hopefully increased investment). As far as I can remember, in the past five years 2 police officers and 2 soldiers were killed in such attacks. 

2) Loyalist flag protesters - Late last year, Belfast City Council councillors voted to remove the British flag (the union jack) from atop the city hall (nationalist politicians now take the majority of seats within the council). Now the union flag only flies on certain designated days. 

This ignited protests from furious loyalists/unionists who wanted the flag put back. Loyalists blocked busy roads all around the city, effectively bringing the city to a standstill at rush hour. This kind of protest continued for weeks on end (they made it a weekly affair) extending across towns and cities across Northern Ireland, with some protests descending into riots, and some loyalists attacking political party offices and making death threats to politicians. There was also an unfortunate incident where loyalist protesters clashed with residents of a nationalist neighbourhood on their way back from the city centre. For a brief few seconds, there was hand to hand fighting on the streets, followed by a back and forth of bricks and bottles thrown in either direction. Nothing too major, but still something that everyone hoped they wouldn't see again. 

Although at first glance it appears that the protests are centred around the flag issue, loyalists have used the protests as an opportunity to protest other issues too, like perceived ill-treatment by the police, and the naming of parks after convicted IRA terrorists. Silly shit like that. 

After the arrest of high-profile leaders of the protests, things have died down, and for now it's all back to normal.

It's coming close to Summer and 'marching season' will be getting under way soon. Like every year, there is likely to be a few riots, particularly around the 12th of July (traditional holiday were loyalist Orange Order marchers parade through the streets of Northern Ireland, including through nationalist neighbourhoods). 

Also, the G8 is being held in Northern Ireland next month, at the Lough Erne golf resort in County Fermanagh. Expect to see dissidents blowing a few things up to get the headlines and maybe a few G8 protests going a bit awry, but nothing too major :P

The other big thing coming up is the World Police and Fire Games, which is being hosted in Belfast this year. It's essentially the Olympics for police and fire fighters. 

On the weather front, as CarlCarlson points out, yes it is still raining. Oh, and [we're running out of potatoes](http://www.u.tv/News/No-potatoes-left-in-NI-claims-farmer/05d6da60-91df-4c94-9bb9-20d6110259fd) again.

The biggest 'issue' is that the growth rate of the Catholic/Irish population outstrips that of the Protestant/British population. That's basically what the flag thing was about, Belfast is an Irish city again and the number of days the British flag is flown from the city hall was reduced, which some people see as a sign of things to come, for better or worse.

It's caused a few splits in Unionist politics, because the response from the main two Unionist parties has been to field joint candidates in some seats, which Unionists see as denying them any alternatives, and most people see as pushing NI back into 'us vs them'.

Oddly, this has been done in seats where the Catholic population is so large that a joint Unionist vote never had any chance of defeating even a split Nationalist vote. Meaning they've pissed a lot of people off and lost seats for no reason at all.

The next elections will be interesting, I think at last count there were going to be at least two new parties next time, one which will probably be the first real liberal Unionist party, and another on the far-right.

On the other hand, the old assumption from the Nationalist parties that Catholics would automatically vote 'yes' has, unsurprisingly, been proven incorrect. All polls say that there wouldn't even be a majority of Nationalists voting for reunification, nevermind a majority of NI.

Their response has been equally bizarre, since they've taken all these polls indicating the answer would be 'no', and decided that now would be a good time to push for a referendum on the issue.

This post is already overly long, but I'll finish with what I think is the biggest problem facing everyone in NI (not 'sides'), which is that the Unionist parties have been co-opted by fundamentalist Christians. I'm from a mixed background/area, and I've never met anyone as loony as some of the DUP politicians are.

That's what's responsible for some of the most embarrassing news coming out of NI, which sounds more like it should come from the Southern US than Europe, including: the fact that 'creationism' was presented as a valid theory for the origin of the Giant's Causeway at the visitors' centre, the attempts to ban abortion, the failure to legalise gay marriage, and the attempt to legalise gun ownership for children.",0,1369007499,null,0,false,0,ca20jqz,t3_1enke4,t1_ca20jqz,t3_1enke4,null,1431101965,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Our experience since good friday has been largely one of detachment. The general view seems to be that ""The North"" is best left alone to manage their own affairs. They're welcome in our republic if they choose (I assume it would be dependent that the republic was functioning a little better than it is right at the moment), but only so long as they keep their troubles contained, which is probably less responsibility on our part than Nationalists deserve (since they view themselves as citizens of our country). Sinn Fein has progressed into a competetive party since the collapse in 2008, grabbing some moderate left republicans who would've voted for Fianna Fail. However, in the Republic, they're actually less accepted than in NI (NI has been healing the wounds of the troubles for many years, but the Republic was bombed too, and Sinn Fein politicians have been attacked over murders and bombings increasingly here. We simply never dealt with it the way they did in the North).

Socially, the border causes problems for both sides. People abuse it to shop cheaper in Northern Ireland, causing the collapse of local economies for border towns in the republic. Liberal tax regimes and loopholes are abused by businessmen on both sides to avail of whichever bankruptcy or taxation laws suit them at the time, and there's a healthy racket of importing petrol and diesel from NI and laundering it in the Republic, or criminals running for the border. 

With the anniversary 1916 looming, it's likely the republic will see a renewal of questions of identity, and an examination of our relationship to NI, republicans may use this as an opportunity to push for reunification. If reunification did happen, there's a growing acceptance a concession would need to be made to the loyalist populations there (rather than the prior view that they'd shut up, or leave, or be made to leave, this is progress), but nobody wants to discuss the details of how this might happen. When the Queen visited the republic, it sealed the progress of normalization of relations with the UK which could in the future allow for a united Ireland to become part of the commonwealth to appease the loyalists (whispers of this idea have appeared in the media, but nobody is championing this yet). Whatever the case (NI may well remain in it's limbo state for quite some time), more options are open now that relations are normalized.

The next general election here will be extremely interesting. It's likely Sinn Fein may gain hugely from disillusionment with government parties and Fianna Fail, being the only remaining large party without culpability for our economic circumstances. The IRA legacy is really all that's hurting them now, but a concerted campaign of attacking everybody else in the next election could be enough to win over a disillusioned electorate. If this allows them to gain power in the Dail, it would mean a cross-border party in a seat of power, which could well make things move very quickly toward reunification, no doubt causing a massive backlash from loyalists and maybe a wakeup call for Sinn Fein voters  that their romantic ideas of a united Ireland would have to be achieved slowly, pragmatically, if they could ever be achieved at all.

I don't think you are right about this. KKE's position has been (and is) total withdrawal from the EU. Papariga mentioned (at some point) that a Euro exit without people in power would be disaster (which is more or less correct), and this somehow got interpreted as a ""remain in the eurozone"".

Problem with KKE is too much ideological purity, if anything.

true,EatYurSaladDave,ULST,Ulster,"&gt;AFAIK sub-prime mortgages have always been significantly riskier by the very definition of what they are. Through CDO's their true risk level was effectively hidden away, which allowed for them to be sold en masse.

In there simplest form, CDO's seem like a good idea, collecting the high risk with the low risk, making each CDO a simple, rateable gamble. A gamble that was rated by outside agency's for outside investors i.e hedge-funds to buy up and make profit. However these agency's, during the build up to the financial crises have been criticised as being biased. If there money is coming from the large investment banks to rate there CDO's, then why would they jeopardise themselves by giving bad ratings. Simple business. 

&gt;Sure unpredictable events can mess up financial markets, but house prices no longer increasing imo was not that kind of event. Eventually prices will stop increasing, that's a basic fact of our economy.

I agree completely, the price of houses was always going to stop going up. What really hit the lenders in the teeth was mortgages that would have a fixed low interest for 2-3 years then set back to market rate. Once this set term came up especially around 2006-07, the number of defaulters in the American economy went sky high, sending way too many banks into the red.

So, trends show that the people of Northern Ireland are describing themselves less and less as either British or Irish. The rise of the Northern Irish nationality doesn't bode too well for either uniting Ireland or staying fully in the UK. The latter especially, as devolution to the Northern Irish Assembly brings more and more power to the Northern Irish people themselves.

When Cameron vetoed it (and rightly so), France threw a fit. If it wasn't for the UK rebate the UK would be paying more towards the EU than any other nation, and that was without the FTT.

true,Kerrt,null,null,"Since 1933, The Worshipful Company of Mercers have taken a strangle hold of the World’s finances via the Temple Bar. England was destroyed when the vermin removed us from the Bradbury Pound, this resulted in raising debt into the billions in order to aid the veiled bankruptcy of the nation. Since 1933 we are now under debt mastered by the Mercers for the Jesuit Order in order to control the nation as a fictional corporation mastered by their Uniform Commercial Code and Admiralty Law based on Vatican Canon Law. The American Republic was hammered after Lincoln’s Greenback was removed just like what happened to the later Bradbury Pound. The Mercers do not like competition to their control, slavery and profits, we are dealing with the pirates of the Livery.

So now we see the Mercers have a major debt creation agenda under way to make sure corporations (once nations) and persons (once beings) are so much in debt that they will be forced to physically and mentally enslave themselves to the new planned carbon trading big brother economy of the New World Order (Temporal Power/World Government of the Pope). You will see real physical assets being stolen to supposedly pay back debts. Just like the Drumcondra mafia do in Ireland stealing the energy reserves from the Irish. It is a fact that the promissory note IOUs are debt instruments and a debt cannot be paid with a debt. So what debt does anyone owe do you ask? The answer is nothing at all.

Now derivatives are even worse of all and they mount well into the quadrillions. It was City of London slave and Jesuit trained President Clinton with Robert Rubin who allowed derivative trading after it had been banned for good reason. It was needed in order to create such massive unjustifiable debts that no one can get out of whilst still in the slave system. Only a new Greenback or Bradbury Pound can save us all. We need to make a new set of currencies based on both gold, silver and credit whilst having them controlled by our own treasuries not these central bank swines and the Bank of International Settlements all under the thumb of the mighty Mercers pirates.

So now Cyprus gets shafted again as its claimed the corporation (nation) owes more than originally thought. Cypriots get hammered for sixty percent of their supposed savings and now they want the real money wealth which is physical gold. Its time to say hell no and move on to de-centralized systems and real assets. I strongly suggest all nations look into the Greenback and Bradbury Pound currencies. I also recommend you all look into The Lawful Bank which is being created by Roger Hayes of the patriotic British Constitutional Group!

true,Reilly616,EURO,European Union,"Another interview which touches on this topic:

&gt;The fifth best in all of comedy history, according to a Channel 4 poll, and certainly among the most intriguing – a surrealist cross-dresser as well-known for bizarre on-stage ‘bits’ involving a varied cast of characters (Sean Connery, a clarinet teacher called Mrs Badcrumble) as he is a successful Hollywood career (most notably the Ocean’s series), running 43 marathons in 51 days and professing an intention to become London Mayor.

&gt;And now, four years after his last major tour, Stripped, he’s back with a brand new, globe-traversing show, Force Majeure. TNT catches up with Izzard for a chat about the tour he’s in the midst of, which stops in London this weekend and then again in June.

&gt;He’s just completed the Euro leg, on which he toured France in French (being fluent, he performed 71 gigs in French in 2011 and has vowed to learn Russian, Arabic and Spanish next). It’s hard to know where to start when interviewing someone so accomplished, but there is something we’ve been dying to ask Izzard for quite some time.

&gt;The long-haired, gravelly-voiced promoter at TNT’s local comedy club in Streatham has often spoken of how he worked with Izzard in his formative years (stopping just short of saying he “discovered” him, but we’ve taken this to be the suggestion).

&gt;“Do you remember PJ?” we ask. “With the long hair?” Izzard shoots back, knowing instantly who we mean. “Yeah, I did some of his gigs ...” Somewhat taken aback – and guilty for ever doubting PJ, too – we almost forget we’re here to talk about business.  

&gt;“Force Majeure can mean ‘act of god’ or it can mean force of nature,” the 51-year old Izzard tells us, getting the chat back on track. ""We have to be our own forces of nature if we want to get things done but you have to give a damn as well – give a damn about other people.” 

&gt;Following on from his atheist-debating, god-considering, and regimented faith-baiting previous outing Stripped, Izzard’s new show looks less at the man upstairs and more at the people down here, and how they live their lives. 

&gt;“We all come from 10,000 people and now there are seven billion, so while the right-wingers point out the differences I am endlessly going to point out our similarities,” he says of the over-arching theme of this new show. “It’s about being sound of mind and body and what we can do on earth. I do talk about god a little but it is more about what we can do.

&gt;“I am 2.8 per cent Neanderthal,” he continues, referring to a recent BBC programme Meet The Izzards, which investigated the Yemen-born but UK-raised Izzard’s genetic lineage. “Most people are between one and four per cent, even the Queen, it is only the African people who are not. So when our ancestors came out of Africa they met Neanderthals and said ‘voulez-vous coucher avec moi?’ and off that all went.”

&gt;Izzard ran 43 marathons in 51 days across the UK in 2009
Mankind’s evolution, in a nutshell, folks. Looking at how we all came to be, and what joins us all, no matter whether you’re a middle-aged comedian touring the world or a plumber in the Netherlands, is a key focus for the show. We notice an element not so much of anger in his voice, but a firm belief in people and what we should be doing to make the world a better place.

&gt;As an activist and campaigner who ran back-to-back marathons over five weeks for 2009’s Sports Relief, and who is setting out on a mega-marathon in South Africa in the new year in honour of Nelson Mandela, he’s as qualified as any to challenge the modus operandi.

&gt;It’s no fluke that he received the annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism this February from Harvard. As our chat weaves through life on earth, it turns towards politics, key elements of both the show and Izzard personally. 

&gt;“Most people in the world are affected by politics. You can argue that financial crises come from greedy people who want to make money,” he says. 

&gt;“The sub-prime mortgage crisis [which rocked the US in 2008 and sent aftershocks round the world] was because mortgages were given to people who would never be able to pay them back. They took their money and ran off to the hills. It is always the rich that get richer during a depression, while most of us get a hard time.”

&gt;He talks with an air of defiance aimed towards the state of the world and it seems this side of him is growing in purpose. Izzard’s shows have always been far more than the surreal, Python-esque flights of fancy they superficially appear.

&gt;Indeed he has spoken in recent years of his desire to move into politics in the future, even going so far as to say he will be quitting comedy in six years time to focus on this alone. Does he really want to run for Mayor of London?

&gt;“Yeah,” he replies, catching us off guard. We thought it may have been a down-the-line aspiration, a goal with no fixed time frame despite media reports to the contrary. Not so.  

&gt;“I am going to do six more years of comedy and drama first. I’ve got the new Hannibal TV show [in which he plays a psychiatric inmate opposite Mads Mikkelsen’s titular flesh-hungry doctor, who was so memorably played by Anthony Hopkins on the big screen]. But yes, I will get down to it.

&gt;“If you look at what I have done with my life, I sold out Madison Square Garden and the Hollywood Bowl, I toured France in French, ran 43 marathons – I can do things in a different way to what people might believe.”

&gt;It is this driven work ethic that sees him take Majeure on a globe-trotting tour that stops off everywhere from Oslo to Kathmandu. “And I am positive about people, I like people,” he says. 

&gt;“I want London to be an inclusive place, more and more open and to encourage people to go for it,” he says when we ask what sort of mayor he’d be. “I will be someone who is a cheerleader of the people, pushing things forward.”

&gt;If Arnie can become governor of the world’s 12th largest economy, California, then why not Izzard for the Big Smoke? But fear not, Force Majeure doesn’t see Izzard all serious. There is still plenty of eccentricity from the man who once wrote a sitcom, 1997’s Cows, starring actors in cow suits.

&gt;“Above all it’s entertainment,” he says, as we’re wondering for a moment whether he’s gone all Mark Thomas on us. “It is funny and surreal and twisted – I cover human sacrifice, Greek gods, Lord Of The Rings, and the Death Star canteen with god and Darth Vader drinking together.” Phew. 
So it seems we’ve got a lot to thank PJ for next time we see him round Streatham? “He was there and I did play his gigs,” Izzard says. “But I wouldn’t say he ‘found me’. I found me!”

Most Poles choose courses in Polish, and the English ones are mainly targetted at foreigners as additional source of income. Not many old teachers know English good enough to teach, that's probably why there aren't more of such courses.

- Last minute ""révision""
- Reading, Reddit world news, le figaro, le monde, l'express, russia today, bbc news

- Going to class
10-13 Passing the International Trade test
- 1 pm : Going to the beach for an apéro/ pic nique with all my class and the erasmus students to celebrate the end of the exam, drinking cidre (normandie &lt;3) and smoking weed
- 15 pm : have to go back to class for extra law lessons (even tough we already pass the exam ! )  because our lazy ass civil servant law teacher didn't finish his hour quota because he was absent when he had to be there teaching us :x
- 16 pm : Fighting with the french administration : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZA8sVgXJuw 
For papers to be signed even tough it's been month that i sent them all, they keep toying with me like a flipper ball from an administration to another @_@


As far as differences are concern, we love apéro, even tough i'm from an immigrant family we eat cheese @ the end of every meal because we live in Normandie ( near the coast where your grandparents came to save us @ 6 th june 69 years ago ).

That's not to say there's no driving: my commute into work in Switzerland is about 30 minutes.

For the kids the life here (the language and food aside) is much like you would imagine the 1950's or 1960's middle America to have been before we had metal detectors and armed guards in our elementary schools.

Unlike America, summer (and winter) vacation is for the adults as well as the kids. In the summer the whole country goes on vacation with their kids, mostly south to the Mediterranean beaches. Ditto for the winter break, but to the Alps to go skiing. I'm generalizing, of course: the entire country is a tourist destination so there's really no end to the possibilities.

There are a lot of big differences in lifestyle. 

**The biggest difference:** the food and the typical diet. 

**The smallest difference:** people. They speak a different language, but they have the same desires, motivations, a sense of humor, etc. The French deal with questions and problems in a different way than Americans, and any Frenchman can turn any conversation into a debate or argument. Everyone loves to talk about food, any time of day. 

**Typical weekday:** 

*  Wake up around 7 a.m., drink a cup of black tea, eat some cereal. 

*  Check e-mail, Reddit, Facebook, read the French and American news if it interests me.

*  Get ready for the day, go to French class. Or don't. 

* Do whatever I want until I pick up the kid from school at 16h45. Typically consists of walking through Lyon on a nice day, stopping by a bakery for a tasty treat, or going home for lunch. Then, I prepare dinner, chase a little boy around to do his homework, play saxophone, and take a shower. Feed him dinner, go home by 20h.

*  Go to theatre rehearsal if I'm in a show, or to voice classes for fun.

*  Go home, go to bed, do it again. 

*  Typical main course that I cook for dinner: baked fresh fish, ratatouille, lasagna with white sauce, quiche, courgette and cream cheese soup, homemade pizza (every Friday night), Lyonnaise Salad, etc. Sometimes it's just peas with lardons and a plate of cheeses and fruit. Every lunch and dinner is always followed by yogurt. The family likes to add white sugar to their yogurt, but not me. Food changes with the season, because the French are more likely to purchase fresh produce available in the local open-air market. This is not a thing in most of America, we Americans eat a lot of food from boxes or cans, and everyone does their shopping at the supermarket rather than the local farmer's market.  Look at me, going on about food. See? They've changed me.


**Weekends:**

*  Maybe a pub with friends, or to a party.  Everyone is nice, and wants to speak drunkenly in English with the nice American lady. Drinking in a pub is expensive, but wine and beer can come cheap at the store. 

*  Sometimes my friends and I drink in parks or, when in Paris, along the canals. This cannot be done in America, or everyone would be arrested. 

*  Walk or bike home to the other side of the city between 3 and 5 in the morning, safe. No one harasses me, no one comes after me. That's the most different aspect from where I lived in America. Where I'm from, I avoided going out alone after dark, and there were many violent and gun-related crimes. 


**Edit:** Oops, I think that I forgot to mention that I live in Lyon. Previously, I lived in Paris. 

Other notable differences: 

*  the French keep to themselves and are a people who value privacy.  If you don't know his/her name, then you shouldn't be asking things like, ""what do you do?"", ""what is your family like?"", etc.  In America, we ask lots of questions, and sometimes talk to strangers in stores or in public transit. This is definitely not a French activity. Sometimes, I see people talk to strangers on the metro, and it just weirds everyone out. When I went back to visit America, I went into a gas station, where the attendant proceeded to talk my ear off and ask me what suddenly seemed like personal questions. That sort of thing doesn't happen at the store in Lyon. You say hello, you do your business, and you leave. 

*  Greeting by giving cheek kisses. 

*  The beauty of train travel. 

*  Speaking multiple languages is very common. Not the case in the U.S.

*  Dog poop, dog poop, dog poop. Oh my god, it's everywhere. ",0,1369041232,null,0,1369043525,0,ca29d38,t3_1eo843,t1_ca29d38,t3_1eo843,null,1431097740,17,false,france,t5_2qhjz,17

Americans really can't live without a car. It's part of the culture to get a car when you turn 16/18/21. There are a few exceptions like NY maybe.
Here it's much rarer to own a car when you're 25 because : 1. It's more expensive (gaz and vehicle). 2. We really don't need it if we live in a city (not country side). We have trains, metros, buses, bikes you can rent for the hour (google ""vélib""). Interestingly our taxi system is really bad because of legal issues (much less liberal than in NY if I'm not mistaken). Taxis are expensive and much harder to find. Unless you are at a railroad station or airport you pretty much have to call one.
The US were built for the car. As a result the typical city is much bigger and spread out. We really don't have the typical American landscape of a huge road, with malls and parkings on either sides for miles.

This is in International law- Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

&gt; It is a firmly established rule of international law that no state may expel its own nationals. Quite apart from violating the international human rights standards described below, it infringes the sovereignty of other states if a state expels or refuses to admit its own nationals.

&gt; Article 13(2) of the UDHR states that ''Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country''. Article 9 prohibits arbitrary exile.

&gt; While the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) does not expressly prohibit expulsion of nationals, this follows indirectly from the right to entry set out in Article 12(4), which states that: ''No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country''.

&gt; It is significant that the right of entry to one's own country is not subject to the restrictions which can be applied to the right to liberty of movement within the state under Article 12(1) or to the right to leave set out in Article 12(2).(10)

&gt; The use of the term ''right to enter'' (rather than right to return) was to cover nationals of a country who have been born abroad and who may have never before set foot in the country whose nationality they hold (UN Doc. E/CN.4/Sub.2/1988/35, para.98).

&gt; The Human Rights Committee, in its General Comment 27 on Article 12 of the ICCPR, issued in October 1999, states:

&gt; ''The right of a person to enter his or her own country recognizes the special relationship of a person to that country. The right has various facets. It implies the right to remain in one's own country. It includes not only the right to return after having left one's own country; it may also entitle a person to come to the country for the first time if he or she was born outside the country (for example, if that country is the person's State of nationality). The right to returnis of the utmost importance for refugees seeking voluntary repatriation. It also implies prohibition of enforced population transfers or mass expulsions to other countries.''

&gt; Article 12(4) of the ICCPR prohibits only ''arbitrary'' denial of the right to enter, which raises the question of what might amount to a ''non-arbitrary'' denial of this right. The drafting history shows that this wording was intended solely to cover lawful individual exile for those few states which still retained it as a criminal penalty. However, the drafters did not wish to go so far as to concede explicitly that exile might be permissible, so this form of words was used in order to cover it implicitly. In view of the drafting history, there is no doubt that the limitation on the right of entry expressed by the word ''arbitrarily'' relates solely to cases of lawful exile as a punishment for a crime, permitting no other form of denial of entry to those who fall within the scope of this provision.

&gt; The Human Rights Committee's General Comment 27 provides a detailed explanation of what constitutes arbitrariness in this context. Paragraph 21 reads:

&gt; ''In no case may a person be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his or her own country. The reference to the concept of arbitrariness in this context is intended to emphasize that it applies to all State action, legislative, administrative and judicial; it guarantees that even interference provided for by law should be in accordance with the provisions, aims and objectives of the Covenant and should be, in any event, reasonable in the particular circumstances. The Committee considers that there are few, if any, circumstances in which deprivation of the right to enter one's own country could be reasonable.''",0,1369043682,null,0,false,0,ca29n8g,t3_1elrfc,t1_ca29n8g,t1_ca296b2,null,1431097608,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

En effet le renouvellement urbain passe forcément par une nouvelle mixité de population. Que des gens riche, moins riches, pauvre, se côtoient au quotidien n'a rien d'alarmant, au contraire. On peut se poser la question de qui est le plus aveugles au réalité sociale, le bobo dans son quartier populaire ""gentrifié"" ou la famille de classe moyenne enfermée dans son pavillon de banlieue.
Ce qui est réellement important c'est le processus de mutation. On ne peut pas exiger que les différentes classes sociales restent chacune de leur coté et donc favoriser la ghettoïsation.

Par contre on peut réclamer que personne ne soit exclu de cette valorisation d'un quartier. Ça doit passer par un contrôle du foncier ( et donc des loyers), l'implantation de logements sociaux et des infrastructure de service adéquate, bref il faut surveiller que la puissance public ne vendent pas le gâteau à des promoteurs affamés, mais qu'elle contrôle et planifie cette mutation urbaine.

true,0xeedfade,ZBSVUE,U-E,"I'm a french student, never moved from my city of birth aside some holidays. It is a middle-sized city, where there is no subway, and the only public transportation is done by bus.

**Typical weekday:** 

*  Wake up around 7 a.m., drink some orange juice, dress-up, put my earphones on and go out.

*  Walk 10 minutes through the city to the nearest bus stop. I don't own a car.

*  take a 30 minutes ride to my campus, where all the science laboratories are grouped together. I'm attending CS classes for a master degree.

*  Attend to classes until 12h30, then go eat some abhorrent food at the nearby ""RU"", ""restaurant universitaire"". A restaurant where food is cheaper because as student we don't pay VAT on it. It serves other public servants as well, firefighters, teachers and the like.

*  Finish my classes at 18h30 (6:30 pm). Two possibilities : stay in the labs to work on some project or another, or go home early.

*  If I'm already on my way to the city center, it means I need to do some shopping, usually only groceries for my week. I live in a very frugal way, as my only income come from the state as a way of ""bourse"" (scholarship granted on social consideration. It means that my parent don't have the means to support me). I don't have the time to work aside of my master. I live with a combined income of 550€ a month.

*  Otherwise I take the last bus at 22h30 (10:30 pm) to go home. I will generally eat a bowl of ramen, or some pasta. Nothing some evening. (I have an extremely sedentary lifestyle, I don't need to eat that much)

*  Listen to music, play some guitar or bass at home. I generally avoid staying on my computer when I don't have any work to do, since it already take up more than 70% of my day.

*  Go to bed around 2 am.


**Weekends:**

*  Usually once or twice a month I go to the pub. I'm sure to find some friends here, even if we don't plan anything (it is a small town. There are several pub, but only three play decent music. The others are shithole where your average douchebag will gather up). I will, as a difference from my colleagues in my CS classes greet them with a kiss on the cheek, even other male (I'm a man). It usually means that we are close friend. I will always greet a woman this way (it may be rude not to, unless she is your boss or a strict professional aquaintance), even the one I've just met. I will always shake hands with a man I've just met (I'm a little slow to warm up to new people).

*  Or it may be a party. I have several social circles that I don't mix that much. Some are musician that play Heavy/Thrash metal. We drink beer and eat meat, smoke a lot. Some are musicology student, and we will eat some vegetarian lasagna while drinking wine. Or it may be an event with some friends from my classes, usually out of town, where everyone is forced to use his car late at night, and thus won't drink at all. I will then walk to the city center on my own if the wheather is merciful, listening to music (usually a 45 minutes walk).

*  Or most of the time nothing at all. I'm not exactly a social fiend.

The city is pretty small, and pretty safe. There is your average squatter, your average junkie or some hobo in the street, but they are not threatening. Well, at least they let you out of their drama (there have been some murder not too long ago amongst them, but they didn't obviously used a gun).

French historians estimate that somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 Harkis and members of their families were killed by the FLN or by lynch mobs in Algeria, often in atrocious circumstances or after torture. The abandonment of the ""Harkis"" both in terms of non-recognition of those who died defending a French Algeria and the neglect of those who escaped to France, remains an issue that France has not fully resolved—although the government of Jacques Chirac made efforts to give recognition to the suffering of these former allies.

It's not. Vergonha happened. I'm not surprised you deny it, lots of people do, but the policies implemented throughout the 20th century that still carry on today are evidence enough of the French government's intention to eradicate minority languages.

&gt;The simple fact that a language disappear doesn't necessarily mean people are getting oppressed... it's could simply mean the language is obsolete, and therefore becoming unused. I think you're jumping steps you should not and making invalid logic shortcuts.

You mean to tell me that without any outside interference at all a language spoken by more than 40% of the people living in France with a rich history and culture disappeared overnight? When has this ever happened before?

&gt;That's the point i contest. Most schools did not forbad anything. French was used simply because it was the most common language around and because they would not translate the program in 15 different language. It's a question of practicality.

In southern France the most common language was Occitan, not French. The imposition of French was not done due to practicality; if the French government cared even one bit about that they'd have used Occitan. 

Besides, even if we suppose French was not used in order to stifle minority languages the fact that students were banned from speaking any other language during school time and that they were punished for doing so certainly casts doubt on the French government's intentions. 

&gt;Yeah and there's still that law around saying women should not wearing pants somewhere in the code. Obsolete and ridiculous laws from centuries ago still lie in every country law code. Doesn't mean any of them get applied anywhere.

It was applied quite strictly back then. It worked too, by the 1920's the rate of Occitan speakers fell to 30%.

&gt;Uh, it's not illegal. 

Yes, it is.

Es würde sich doch mittel und langfristig für die Telekom lohnen Glasfaser auszubauen. Sehen die nicht, dass sie das refinanziert bekommen? 

Ach da wüde mal gerne mal in deren Kalkulation reinschauen. Wie war es denn damals beim Kupfernetz? Das war ja auch richtig richtig teuer. Hatte sich das amortisiert? 

Also entweder denken die nur kurzfristig und wollen jetzt ihre Profite maximieren (weil das Kupfernetz ist abgeschrieben, die Infrastrukturkosten für Mobilfunk sollten sich auch mittlerweile refinanzieren) und wollen die Infrastruktur solange runterwirtschaften wie es geht. Hier und dort mal eine LTE-Antenne anbringen kostet wohl weniger als flächendeckend Glasfaser auszubauen. 

Andererseits könnten sie wenn sie langfristig denken und überall Glasfaser puschen in ein paar Jahren überall 1Gbit/s anbieten ohne Angst vor Konkurrenz. 

Ansonsten sehe ich die Kommunen Glasfaser legen und die Telekom hat nichts davon. 

Hätten sie in den 90igern FTTH flächendeckend im Osten durchgezogen könnten sie sich jetzt entspannt zurücklehnen und müssten nur aller 5 Jahre mal die Router auswechseln - oder sehe ich das falsch?

Half of France dont consider Arabs as French, they are barely represented in public functions, Right wing politicians speak against them all the time- you think its a surprise they dont feel integrated?

Wake up at 6 am and be a janitor or sell hash? The answer is pretty easy to find.

The problem in France is a socio-economic one. It is not that ""Muslims"" are born to do crime, it is that they have the least opportunities in a country where opportunities are already very small.

I would love to start a discussion about the fact that we seem to be taking in all these war refugees from african civil wars (for example), and about that I believe our society doesn't do enough effort towards integrating them. Or perhaps about the problem of ""beggars"" who come from a certain country/area, who at least some have been suspected of being part of criminal organisations. They fly in, stay for the summer to beg, then fly back home for the rest of the year.

Try to have discussions about these subjects, and you get immediately get marked as racist, or they will brush the subject aside ""yeah its fine, no need to do anything"".

When people go to vote in their members of Parliament they know exactly who that MP is going to support for head of government. They know exactly what the MP's policies are (including what prime ministerial candidate he/she supports). So when a constituent votes, they know exactly what they are voting for. They know that if that MP gets into office, he'll support the prime ministerial candidate he/she said he/she would. Therefor when a constituent votes for an MP they are also voting for the prime ministerial candidate that MP is backing.

This is not the case with the European Commission. Parties and prime ministers never state what their opinion of any European Politicians are and are usually unable to because the appointments to the European Commission happen at different times to when national elections take place. So the government decides who they think we'll prefer without consulting us. When we turn out to vote, we are completely in the dark about who our MP and who our prime minister will vote for at the European appointment of the European Commission.

So, national governments *are* elected and the European government is appointed. Unless we're talking about the European parliament, but that's the legislature not the executive.

true,Doxep,campania,,"Andrea si svegliò, sudatissimo e tremante. Sapeva bene che la sua condizione non era dovuta al caldo torrido di Luglio a Guadalajara, ma ad un altro di quei stramaledetti incubi.

*Pronto, sono Elena di Telecom, si occupa lei della bolletta?*

Non riusciva a dormire, non aveva più fame, si sentiva a disagio nella sua stessa casa, acquistata vendendo l'appartamento e l'automobile che aveva in Italia. La continua successione di chiamate di telemarketer lo aveva infatti costretto a fingere uno spettacolare incidente automobilistico, dopo il quale la sua macchina aveva preso fuoco, lasciando solo una scelta ai paramedici giunti sul posto: dichiararlo deceduto. 

Con immenso dolore aveva provato a dimenticare la moglie Giovanna e i due figli, Michele e Maria, di cinque e otto anni, a cui però pensava ancora spesso. Chissà se stanno bene, chissà cosa pensano della mia morte. Chissà se la nonna li sta aiutando a superare la mia perdita. Chissà se l'ENEL li chiama ancora.

L'iscrizione al registro delle opposizioni nel Settembre 2011 non era servita a nulla; le chiamate continuavano ad arrivare, ad ogni ora del giorno, si erano fatte sempre più insistenti, fino a fargli perdere la sanità mentale. La cosa che Andrea odiava di più di quelle telefonate era la finta gentilezza delle operatrici e degli operatori, che si sforzavano di sembrare cortesi ed educati mentre in realtà non ascoltavano le sue ripetute richieste di rimuovere il suo elenco dai loro database, dato che era iscritto al Registro delle Opposizioni.

Adesso Andrea era qui, in un piccolo appartamento a Guadalajara, solo, triste e sudato. L'unica cosa che aiutava a tenere a bada la sua tristezza era la sua intima certezza che, dopo un fisiologico periodo di aggiustamento, la sua vita sarebbe tornata ad essere libera da quelle ossessive telefonate pubblicitarie.

Si alzò, dirigendosi in cucina per prepararsi un caffè all'italiana con la moka che era riuscito a portarsi dietro in Messico. All'improvviso, il telefono squillò. Andrea fu colpito da un invisibile pugno di ghiaccio nello stomaco: sentì il suo sangue congelarsi nelle vene e la pelle d'oca sulla nuca.

Tremante, si avvicinò al telefono. Guardò la cornetta e attese per un tempo che gli sembrò lunghissimo. Sì, stava davvero squillando. All'ennesimo squillo prese coraggio e si portò la cornetta all'orecchio destro. Attese, quasi sperando che avessero sbagliato numero, e infine riuscì a gracchiare: ""Pronto?""

The Swedish police has been systematically increasing their own levels of violence in recent years. Ten years ago the police had hand-guns with standard ammunition and billy clubs. Since then the police has asked for an been outfitted with pepper spray and smoke grenades, telescopic batons and most astonishing of all the *standard* loadout for the Swedish police is now dum-dum bullets for their handguns. This kind of ammonition is *banned* by the Geneva convention for use in warefare because if causes unnecessary suffering. Obviously cops need that, right?

The Swedish police also has extraordinary legal rights on top of this escalation. Because of the way the Swedish legal system works the police can and routinely ask for warrants to be applied retroactively. That is to say, they break into your home with the SWAT unit, drag you to the station and keep you in a cell potentially *indefinitely* (which Swedish law allows in some cases), all without any sort of legal orders or special permission, and if it leads to something that's even potentially illegal or suspicious being found then a warrant can be issued and applied after the case making it not illegal for the police to act in this manner. And if they don't find anything there's no internal policing department so the event gets written off as a case of ""professional error"" and trying to then bring that to court as an individual is almost impossible. And the police are not risking anything from a procedural point of view either because evidence is evidence and Swedish laws does not care if it was gathered illegally.

Add to this that the police has markedly decreased their requirements for being one and that many high-profile cases of police corruption and misconduct has been brought up by media in recent times and this reaction from a generation of young people feeling neglected and discriminated against because of their ethnicity (because we are talking about immigrants here: this suburb is a heavily segregated ghetto by Swedish standards) does not seem so odd, don't you agree?

Rock and stuff:

Die Ärzte (was mentioned before, try ""Schrei nach Liebe"" or ""zu spät"". Since the 80s till now)

Die Toten Hosen (try ""Alles aus Liebe, ""10 kleine Jägermeister"", ""Alex"". also 80s to now)

Ton Steine Scherben (""Keine Macht für Niemand"". 70s to 80s)

Rio Reiser (""König von Deutschland"")

Nina Hagen (""Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen"")


Tocotronic (Part of the so called ""Hamburger Schule"", ~~in the UK also called ""Kraut Rock""~~. 90s -now)

Die Sterne (""Was hat dich bloß so ruiniert"". Another example for the ""Hamburger Schule"". 90s - not to too long ago?)


Beatsticks (since ~2000)

Sportfreunde Stiller (since ~2000)


Electro:

Kraftwerk (for example ""Das Model"")

I really don't know much about electro, can think of Westbam (90s), and there is more in this direction.


Hip Hop and similar stuff:

Die Fantastischen Vier (""Die da"" was their first hit, ""Sie ist weg"" They were the first POPULAR german hip hop. 90s to quite recent)

Fettes Brot (""Jein"", ""Nordish by nature"". mostly 90s)

Deichkind (for example ""Remmidemmi"". 90s, They became more electronic since)

Sido and Bushido became popuar too since (~2000), but I don't know why and don't ask me what their songs names are..

Also Peter Fox (for example ""Schwarz zu blau""), before active with Seeed (""Dickes B"". 2000s)


Schlager (the kind of music that gets played on village parties and similar events...):

Udo Jürgens (""Griechischer Wein"", ""17 Jahr blondes Haar"". 70s)

Peter Maffay (""Über 7 Brücken"". 80s?)

Wolfgang Petry (""verlieben verloren"". 90s?)

Jürgen Drews (""Ein Bett im Kornfeld"". 70s)


Other stuff:

Bap

Pur - Wunderland (80s)

Xavier Naidoo (90s -now)

Nena (""99 Lufbalons"", Irgendwann, irgendwo, irgendwie"". 80s)

Silbermond (kind of current)

Juni (""Die perfekte Welle"")

Modern Talking (I am so sorry...80s)

Trio - Da da da (80s)

Die Onkelz (political very um..controversal, but to give you a broad picture, they are also mentioned in ""Schrei 
nach Liebe"" by the Ärzte in a negative way. 90s)

Ramstein (I guess you know them)


If you also want some old stuff:

Comidian Harmonists (for example ""Meine kleiner Kaktus"". 20s)

Marlene Dietrich (""Lilli Marleen"", ""Ich bin von Kopf bis Fuß"". 30s)


OK I'll stop here. This list is kind of random. But it might give you an idea.

Germany has a long and rich history for music. Starting with people like Johan Sebastian Bach, Felix Mendelson or Richard Wagner, via German Schlager (not my area, so I know no one), german electronical music (Kraftwerk obviously, but also Maruscha, Blümchen, Paul van Dyk, Sven Väth, nowadays Oliver Schories or Kollektiv Turmstraße, Allen Allien, Gesaffelstein etc. etc.). Then there is german Rock like Rammstein, Guano Apes, german german rock (as in rock music with german lyrics) and the Neue Deutsche Welle (Nena 99 Luftballons is known all over the world) ... you see, there are really a lot of options to go for.

If you look at your assignment from the historical point of view - which song was influential at its time, then I think you need to take songs like ""David Hesselhoffs - Freedom"" into consideration, maybe for the lols only^^ - and even tho it isnt a german song, it had some (disputable) influence.

Well, not to do your work for you, but here is my list: (in no particual order)

Heintje - Mama ... Heintje is actually dutch, but he was a huge, and I mean huge in the sense of massiv, success back in the days. In 1986 he was #1 in Germany with his first album... was in the charts for 84 weeks!

Da Hool - meet her at the loveparade ... everybody knows the Loveparade, and this is maybe the most famous anthem (for the Loveparade 1997).

Die Ärzte - Claudia hat nen Schäferhund ... die Ärzte are a german punk rock band, and as you may know, German has an institution, that decides whether songs (lyrics), movies or video games are dangerous, meaning they wont be allowed to play. The reasons behind the decission have changed over the year, but a song about a girl being eaten out by her german shepard certainly hit a nerf, back in the days.
I find this song to be interesting, because it shows the german sense of zensorship and how far freedom of speech goes, compared to countries like the states, where the Hustler decission by the suprem court is considered a milestone for freedom of speech.

Kraftwerk - das Model ... german elektro pop... like THE german elektro pop legend. Probably the reason why people connect Germany to electronica as much as they do.

Karl Heinz Stockhausen - Gesang der Jünglinge ... what Kraftwerk is for modern electronical music, Stockhausen is for electronical / experimental music in general. He is like the godfather of it.

die fantastischen Vier - die Da ... first german Hiphop track that made the charts... well, not my area of expertice (hiphop) but pretty certain. It is trashy as fuck... but kinda funny.
MFG (mit freundlichen Grüßen) is their most known song.

Rammstein - Mutter / du hast ... another band bordering on zensoring. Known worldwide, and with a strange lyrical sense, which I personally find rather refreshing and charming.
The most interesting part about 'du hast' ist, that it shows the versatility of the german language... because 'du hast' and 'du hasst' is near to impossible to hear the difference between, when said, but the meaning goes for miles (du hast - you have / du hasst - you hate).

Rio Reiser - Junimond ... was quoted a lot already

Nena - 99 Luftbalons ... as I said above, it is known all over the world.

Richard Strauss - also sprach Zarathustra ... some classical music.

Udo Lindenberg ... a very famous (in Germany at least) singer... I don't know any of his songs tho^^ not my style of music.

Heino ... same as Lindenberg, and still not my style of music.

Marius Müller Westernhagen ... same as the two above

Herbert Grönemeyer - Männer / Bochum ... really famous german singer, living in London today.

Die Toten Hosen - alles nur aus Liebe ... song about commiting suicide out of love. German punk rock.

Matthias Claudius - Der Mond ist aufgegangen ... a german lullaby

Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht ... a german christmas carol, known as 'Silent night, holly night' in the anglo-american realm. Not certain whether it is originating from Germany tho.

Mathias Reim - Verdammt ich liebe dich ...

Ton Steine Scherben: Rauchhaus-Song

Paul van Dyk - for an angel ... never have known a better lovesong in electronic music. He composed it for his wife. Paul also is a huge advocate against the abuse of drugs, and sponsors school projects in India.

Well, those are a few I could come up with. Have fun exploring...

As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a five year phase in plan that would be known as ""EuroEnglish"".

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the troublesome ""ph"" will be replaced with the ""f"". This will make words like ""fotograf"" 20 per cent shorter. 

&gt; In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent ""e""s in the language is disgraseful, and they should go away. 

&gt; By the 4th year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing ""th"" with ""z"" and ""w"" with ""v"". During ze fifz year, ze unesesary ""o"" kan be dropd from vords kontaining ""ou"" and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters.

**Ton Steine Scherben - Macht kaputt was euch kaputt macht** (1970)

The band was influential in the student protests in the late 60s / early 70s. This song is kind of a theme of the rebellion, flat out rejecting capitalism and it's destructive influence on the individual, and calling for the destruction of it and everything that comes with it.

**Nicole - Ein bisschen Frieden** (1982)

Won the Eurovision Song Contest with a Song embodying the Zeitgeist with a (mainstreamed) message resembling the peace movement, which was very strong at that time.

**Nena - 99 Luftballons** (1983)

Most successful song of the Neue Deutsche Welle, very successful internationally and even nr. 2 in the US billboard charts. Being fed up with the cold war is also the topic in this song.

**U96 - Das Boot** (1992)

The Techno craze was already big underground, but the success of this song made it hit the the mainstream and had its part in making Techno a mass movement and market.

**Die Fantastischen Vier - Die Da** (1992)

As sad as it is, this song was the first comercially succesful German rap song and made way for better stuff to come.",0,1369075471,null,0,false,0,ca2hkkq,t3_1eoxft,t1_ca2hkkq,t3_1eoxft,null,1431093861,6,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,6

http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/zwiebelfisch/zwiebelfisch-abc-gerne-gern-a-323744.html

&gt;Einen Bedeutungsunterschied zwischen ""gern"" und ""gerne"" gibt es nicht, auch in stilistischer Hinsicht ist kein Unterschied festzustellen - beide Formen gelten als gleichwertig.
&gt;
&gt;Die Form mit Endungs-e ist die ältere. Wie bei vielen anderen Wörtern auch hat sich die Endsilbe im Lauf(e) der Zeit in der gesprochenen Sprache verschliffen. Da sich Sprache in einem ständigen, nie endenden Optimierungsprozess befindet, werden Endsilben, die keine grammatische Funktion erfüllen, früher oder später abgestoßen. So hört man heutzutage häufiger ""gern"" als ""gerne"". Noch deutlicher wird die Entwicklung bei ferne/fern: Heute sieht man kaum noch jemanden ""von ferne"" winken, meistens heißt es ""von fern"". Mitunter verhält sich Sprache aber auch genau anders herum und lässt Wörter länger werden, ohne dass es dafür einen erkennbaren Grund gäbe. So geschehen mit ""allein"", das man oft auch als ""alleine"" antrifft, was aber nicht der Standardsprache entspricht.

tl;dr: there is no difference, use whichever one you like, both are currently equally valid.

It's a word in flux, *gerne* is older (and sounds just a tiny bit more formal to me, I'd probably use it in a more formal context) *gern* is younger and sounds less formal to me, something I'd use when talking about something as leisurely as a ""Kinobesuch"". I think many Germans use both versions and just pick by ear what sounds right in the context and I'm sure there are also huge regional differences. All you need to know: you're not making a mistake by picking either one (for now) but it looks like ""gern"" will win the battle at the moment.

By the way, Zwiebelfisch is an amazing resource for the nuances and oddities of the German language ... and when reading just a fraction of it, you'll already end up speaking better German than most Germans.

true,Jeppep,NORW,Norway,"**Crises and Growth, 1914-1945**

Officially Norway was neutral during World War I. However, in terms of the economy, the government clearly took the side of the British and their allies. Through several treaties Norway gave privileges to the allied powers, which protected the Norwegian merchant fleet. During the war's first years, Norwegian ship owners profited from the war, and the economy boomed. From 1917, when Germany declared war against non-friendly vessels, Norway took heavy losses. A recession replaced the boom.

Norway suspended gold redemption in August 1914, and due to inflationary monetary policy during the war and in the first couple of years afterward, demand was very high. When the war came to an end this excess demand was met by a positive shift in supply. Thus, Norway, like other Western countries experienced a significant boom in the economy from the spring of 1919 to the early autumn 1920. The boom was followed by high inflation, trade deficits, currency depreciation and an overheated economy.

The international postwar recession beginning in autumn 1920, hit Norway more severely than most other countries. In 1921 GDP per capita fell by eleven percent, which was only exceeded by the United Kingdom. There are two major reasons for the devastating effect of the post-war recession. In the first place, as a small open economy, Norway was more sensitive to international recessions than most other countries. This was in particular the case because the recession hit the country's most important trading partners, the United Kingdom and Sweden, so hard. Secondly, the combination of strong and mostly pro-cyclical inflationary monetary policy from 1914 to 1920 and thereafter a hard deflationary policy made the crisis worse (Figure 3).

So i'll just jump in:

Since you said yourself you don't know much about electronic music: The one most influential person (there are many) that has to be on the list is Sven Väth.

Also imo Wolfsheim definatly deserve to be on that list. Took long enough for ""electro pop"" to take over. They've just been ahead of their time a couple of years.

Instead of Peter Fox you should have mentioned Seeed. With their popularity came a huge ""Deutsch-reggae"" boom (culcha candela and the likes) and they're still (as is Peter without the band) pioneers of German music culture.

Some might argue that helping others and standing up to people is more important than not wanting to get involved.

100 degrees in Saudi Arabia/Dubai is not the same 100 degrees in Greek islands.

100 degrees in landlocked area with no access to the sea has extreme levels of humidity where it feels like it is 120 degrees+.

100 degree fahrenheit* in Greek islands feels like a 80-90 degree middle eastern weather due to the fact there is extremely little humidity on the greek islands due to Sea filtering the atmosphere.

Also a 100 degree day in Greek islands right now is very very rare, only 2-3 days of the year are close to that . . . this doomsday scenario of yours where Greece burns to ashes from the 1-2 degree rise will not happen because the scenario you are proposing is already there.

It rains very very little on the islands, soil is not great and tourism is still excellent . . . an extra 1-2 degrees 10-20 days out of the year in July/August will not cause Greece to collapse . . . this is one of the most extremely delusional doomsday scenarios I have ever heard.

Fatevelo dire da uno che varia regolarmente a seconda della necessità, anche se prediligo la posizione di spalle ma credo per una questione di abitudine più che altro. ( e anche perchè caco molto più spesso di quanto scopo)
Ogni ""posizione"" ha i suoi pro e contro. Ad esempio quella di spalle è molto efficace nel lavarsi il didietro, con l'inconveniente delle gocce che bagnano gamba e magari slip/pantaloni quando si passa al davanti per una sciacquatina ai gioielli. Quella frontale è meno incasinata da questo punto di vista ma non permette la stessa efficacia nel lavarsi fronte/retro.

In conclusione, ogni circostanza ha la sua posizione e, cosa molto più importante, ognuno ha il diritto di farsi il bidet un po' come cazzo gli pare :D

true,groumpf,NPDC,Nord-Pas-de-Calais,"If your EU family member is not French AND is going to be living with you in France, then you can work, study, get social security coverage, and basically have the exact same rights as an EU citizen.

Doing all the right paperwork (for your family member and yourself) will help tremendously with actually enforcing your rights. I don't know what kind of paperwork is involved in France: it can range from registering with the police and applying for a permit (that cannot be refused: the receipt for the application form itself is usually enough to convince employers of your right to work) to having to jump through semi-legal hoops that are mostly there to discourage you.

In any case, the law is clear: none of that stuff is technically needed, and as soon as you are a family member of an EU/EEA national exercising his treaty rights, you should automatically be treated as an EU citizen for any legal purposes. The main objective of doing the paperwork is to make it easier to prove your status.

A quick note: the definition of ""family member"" may vary slightly from member state to member state. France does recognize common-law partners, but some evidence may be required (joint bank accounts, common address). Similarly, filiation needs to be proved and, if you are the EU citizen's parent, you will need to prove that you are their dependent.

EDIT: Some general information can be found [here](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-family/): it looks like the law has changed since I last looked at it, and you may need an entry visa. Note that the law is still clear about the fact that such a visa should be obtained quickly and free of charge. I'll let you peruse the site. Let us know if you have any more questions.

EDIT again: I realize that the link i just provided does not actually answer your question. i am leaving it here in case it is of help to someone else. Since you already have the family member visa for another EU country (and assuming it is a Schengen country or the UK), you should be fine for entering France.

&gt; He explained that it had been reported as far back as 2005 that the development process was not being properly followed and that there was a lot of necessary improvisation due to the addition of new elements at the request of the Ministry of Defence.

Some of this sounds [familiar](http://tuftsdev.github.io/SoftwareEngineering/docs/readings/vasacasestudy.pdf)...

&gt; On 10 August 1628, the Royal Swedish Navy’s newest ship set sail on its maiden voyage. The Vasa sailed about 1,300 meters and then, in a light gust of wind, capsized in Stockholm’s harbor, losing 53 lives.

&gt; Based on a series of ongoing and confusing changes the King ordered during the spring and summer of 1625, Henrik requested oak timbers be cut from the King’s forest for two 108-foot ships and one 135-foot ship...

Also I wanted to add, that when everybody says Mannheim is ugly, it's mostly linked to the fact, that it's city centre is really dense. It was planned ~1600AD and it's a grid like Manhattan or your usual American City. Given that they didn't have cars and trams back then, the roads and pedestrian zones are kinda small-ish, compared to other german cities.

Then you had the ""Gangsta rap"" with mainly NTM and Mafia k'1fry who made a huge difference. It started to express violent anger with sometimes description of sadness and sorrow. A few other artists were there to add there little contribution to the movement (such as LIM Alibi Montana etc..). The the Rap has known a very strang transition from the gangsta to what we can call ""commercial"" (made especially to make money instead of having social purpose). Even Rohff, considered as one of the best ever fell in the commercial. Now the rap is well known for ""swagg"" artists such as Booba or Maitre Gims. Objectively you can say it is evoluting but i personnaly believe that this ""evolution"" is going worse and worse since the end of the gangsta rap. The last Major album (that went on radio and TV) that you can consider as not swagg is Le code de l'horreur by Rohff. Rest has become an equivalent of Lil Wayne or Drake but with a french touch.

Of course, the Muslims in Sweden took this as a personal attack and decided the best course of action would be rioting and burning property. Even when socioeconomic status is taken into account, Muslim immigrants commit crime at a rate 73% higher than non-Muslims living in western countries.
