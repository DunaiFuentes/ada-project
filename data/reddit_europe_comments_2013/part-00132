One might argue that spying on ones allies increases global stability. If I were convinced of this I might support a change to the law and international treaties to make it legal. I haven't heard that argument yet and I'm not convinced it's true.

The reactions of some of the representatives of affected states and organizations suggests they too do not find the spying acceptable, though I doubt they are so naive as to be unaware that spying happens even among the closest of allies.

Criminals are everywhere. When you catch them, you don't let them off because there are lots of them.

Take your time.  Most foot injuries are caused from you walking too long without breaks or at higher than normal speeds because of the excitement of being on the camino.  If you see something intriguing, stop and check it out.  You aren't on the clock.

However if you plan on a summer trip, consider bringing a tent.  It's a busy season and camping is extremely safe along the way.

Buy a guide book, but don't read too into it.  I used John Brierly's guidebook which details each ""stage"" of the camino with maps and prices of accommodations. Sometimes the best places/experiences are in the towns that aren't the final checkpoint of the stage, so follow your heart wherever you go.  There is nothing wrong with a 15 k day if it makes for a good memory.  

I recommend staying at the albergue ""Almacen"" in Villarmentero del Campos. They have tipis, great food, and a lovely donkey named Emilio.  I had a life changing moment there and will forever find it to be a small patch of paradise.

*King Rat* è molto diverso da [*Shōgun*](http://www.reddit.com/r/BooksAMA/comments/1g9ah6/jfr_sh%C5%8Dgun_by_james_clavell_ama/), che ho letto in precedenza.

Narra la storia di alcuni prigionieri di guerra a Singapore durante la seconda guerra mondiale. Mi è piaciuto, ma non tantissimo.

Something definitely ought to happen if for no other reason than that there's an election in three months and it has previously been proven that campaigning on an anti-American sentiment can work very well, by ex-Chancellor Schröder about whom it has been claimed that his re-election in 2002 was a result of his firm stance against the Iraq War.

------------------------

@Silence_hr,  

Apologies for that.  There is a bit of a learning curve but we'll start off relatively shallow and allow you just to get your feet wet.  We'll get to the more serious stuff later.

First of all, try thinking of this new club that you've joined as a big Yugoslavia.  In fact, the very process you've just gone through is a staged variant of Balkanisation, only much, much bigger and with much higher stakes and less say.  Now, to put yourself in the proper mood;  Le Pen is on the rise in France^1, support in Spain has halved since the crisis^2 - which there shows no sign of abating, Cyprus literally had its current accounts raided^3, the Greek IMF bailout stretches into 2022 but chances are it's not going to stop there^4, and Italian lenders have said that if something major doesn't change soon then Italy will need a bailout within the next 6 months^5.  Good luck getting any meaningful reform through, 20 years of trying and the UK has all but given up, in fact the whole idea of closer integration isn't going to happen because the UK has a black ball  referendum on further EU powers.  Already the fears of the CFP are beginning to take seed.  Turn yourself over to the scepticism.^6

Ease yourself into it.  

Once you're hauled before the ECJ a couple of times by others that flagrantly abuse the singlemarket law, which is pretty much everyone except Finland, it will start to come naturally.  Also the President of the Parliament recently described his favourite book as an inspiration to him^7: the author was a Marxist apologist of Stalin who defended the liquidation of millions of people if it meant forcing a political agenda - many of them would have been Slavs.^8  Oh, EUphoria, the President's inspiration is a man who justified a double holocaust if it meant achieving political goals.   

If you do feel you need any pointers, remember to tune your viddy screen into the Commission paid for broadcast network,^9 and they are looking for a conflict to join^10 , so try to keep an eye out.

I was wondering what the European Union should, and realistically *can* do about this whole affair.

By ""realistically"" I mean, calls  to end all diplomatic ties with the US (something that I've read a few times in here) are obviously not an option.

But how about severely restricting access of US personnel to EU buildings? I mean, they bugged our most important European political buildings. It should be possible to tell them that, for the foreseeable future, nobody who works for the US government, direct or indirect, can freely move in sensitive areas of EU offices anymore.

But some things that I would have done retrospectively; is learn at least minimal spanish. I lucked out by meeting some catalan people on my first day who I could speak some french to. Without their help, I would have been severely lost and wouldn't have found the Albergue. I also met an awesome group of people, some of which event taught me spanish! 

I had a useless guidebook, what you need is specific instructions with lists of all albergues in all the towns so you know your options. Directions/maps would be helpful too. Though, as you'll most likely join in with which ever group of people you run into on your way, you'll all make group decisions as long as you have the same time deadlines.

There's shoe and adventure shops in the larger towns such as Burgos and Leon if you need things like poles or new shoes. I agree with the other advice about using walking shoes, NOT hiking shoes. You'll be mostly walking flat trails and not hugely rocky hikes. That being said, you will need to be comfortable on all ground types.

I had a 30L backpack and it was the absolute minimum I would have chosen,  I would have preferred a little bigger.

I went in February-March, which is winter and I wholeheartedly recommend going in this time period!! Most private albergues were closed, and we had to stay in mainly municipal ones. We got a list from one of the Albergues early on, which was a HUGE help that described which Albergues were open and when. I went through snow, rain, mud and wonderful sunshine and warmth and I wouldn't want it any other way. I heard too many horror stories about people doing it in summer and leaving each morning at 5am just to secure a spot at the next stop so that they don't have to sleep in a parking lot or church.

Deutschland hat nach dem 11.September versprochen ""unsere besten Freunde"" vollkommen zu unterstützen. Alle Innenminister seit 2011 sind als rechts/konservativ/republikanisch zu bezeichnen. Es ist also davon auszugehen, dass die gesamte Abhöraktion mit Wissen uns Zustimmung der jeweiligen Regierungen stattgefunden hat.

Es werden Dokukmente auftauchen die beweisen, dass Wolfang Schäuble schon länger davon wusste als alle anderen und wir werden alberne Rechtfertigungen hören wie:""Dadurch sind in Deutschland Anschläge verhindert worden."" ...ohne den Rest zu schreiben:""...Anschläge die es nie gegeben hätte, wenn wir Kriegstreiber USA nicht unterstützt hätten.""

Interessant wird werden, wie sich die weniger korrupten Schweine des Landes verhalten: Justiz und Wirtschaft; zugegeben die Wirtschaft ist sicher auch sehr korrupt..aber die Justiz (Brix) sicher auch.

Die Justiz in Form von Bundesstaatsanwaltschaft wird als erstes aufgeregt ermitteln...was das bringt sieht man bei der NSU. Danach...also viel viel später, werden die DAX Konzerne wach.
Die deutsche Wirtschaft ist eine der dümmsten der Welt, weil es nirgendwo so wenige CTOs gibt...was auch die Problematik erklärt, warum die Deppen sich so leicht abhören lassen. Oder im Rückschluß: Warum Siemens dauernd beim Betrügen erwischt wird wie so viele andere Deutsche Unternehmen...Deutsche Bank, Mercedes etc.

Dann wird die Wirtschaft Konsequenzen fordern, um den ""Industriestandort Deutschland zu schützen""...also im die illegalen Machenschaften von VW,Siemens usw. zu schützen.

Und danach kommt dann raus, dass es bereits einen Vertrag gibt, der die Unterstützung der Abhöraktionen erlaubt mit der einzigen Einschränkung, dass es nicht zu Wirtschaftsspionage kommt.

Und danach wird die konservative deutsche Presse, also die die am Betrug mitverdient wie Springer, Burda usw.., die Kanzlerin hochleben lassen für ihre Weitsicht.

true,icaromennipus,null,null,"Low absorption is definitely bad. Given that the aim of EU funds is to reduce regional disparities in terms of income, wealth and opportunities between the poorest and richest countries. EU members with low absorption rates are missing out on a lot of opportunities, not least opportunities for employment and gaining skills and competencies, and the country misses out on potential economic growth. 

&gt;What causes funds to be not absorbed?

Most European projects are co-funded meaning that let's say for example a local authority in a recipient nation wants to build a hospital. They still have to come up with 50% of the financing and what's more they have to organise everything ie they have to have the project assessed and approved by the EU and then carry out the design and tendering procedure according to very specific and rigid regulations. All this requires administrative competencies that might not be available to that country, meaning that they might just not have enough trained and competent civil servants to deal with the workload. Furthermore, let's say delays have been caused because the host country's construction industry is in crisis, ie. they have not found a reliable, financially sound, contractor to carry out the works in a reliable way, then the project is cancelled and the funds have to be returned. Mostly it's the inability of local authorities to come up with their share of the project's financing that is the cause for the low absorption and many local authorities have taken up a lot of debt so they can have higher absorption rates.


&gt;What happens to funds that are allocated but not absorbed?

Structural and cohesion funds are about a third of the EU budget which is allocated over a seven year period (currently 2007-2013). The amount available in the pot for this period is about 357 billion Euro of which something close to 200 billion has been allocated to national projects so far. As I understand it, money that has not been allocated to projects or has been claimed back because of non-compliance, irregularities etc is simply returned to that pot and if it's not spent by 2015 then it is redirected away from national projects back to the general EU budget.

If a country is net receipient for 30 years, and need more money than ever - we should re-evalue the strategy.

However, the EU does nothing of that, instead they take in more countries. I have nothing againt that really, but the money has to come from somewhere.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;It seems like a scheme to get money from Germany as much as to protect the EU farmers from the rest of the world. I am sure the EU does other things with it's pocket money, but I am not quite aware of them right now.


 44 % of the budget currently goes to CAP (Common agrucultural Policy). Two of the biggest receipients of the rural development is France and Italy, two G7 countries that have been on the receiving end of this for 40 + years. Apparently it is not working or they would be on the receiving end any more, but the EU seem to refuse to cut it, or re-evalue it, drastically. If it were working, they wouldn't need it. Not to mention that we sponsor ineffective and downright dangerous stuff with it, like tobacco and wine. 

&gt; but I think the idea is that half the money of the EU is used to build/improve the infrastructure of the less develloped european countries, so that they can be economically competitive.

But it is not working. If it were, why is Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain etc in need of more money that ever. Perhaps we should re-evalue it and concentrate much more on education, research or other stuff that truly makes us competitive, not an empty airfield in the middle of Spain. 

What irritates me is that the EU seem to have no plan and no capacity for re-evaluation, no strategy. 

They are taking in countries that need money, but are not re-evaluating it strategies. If sponsoring infrastructure worked- why isn't Spain a net payer, for example? I think the whole budget and the direction has to be re-evaluated, not to mention huge programs like CAP - if rural development worked, why are they stille receiving money after 40 + years? If building highways is not working (clearly) - is there anything else we should do perhaps? 

I just feel that they are not spending money wisely, not at all. Furthermore, they are not evaluating what has worked and what hasn't, and to top it off, they seem to have no strategy. Not a good grade, not at all.

Ma soprattutto: basta intercettazioni incostituzionali basate sul patriot act. Cosa ha fatto finora? Tutto il contrario, tranne due frasette buttate li sugli omosessuali e sull'ambiente: ha firmato l'ndaa, ha legalizzato de facto le intercettazioni, il ritiro delle truppe solo parziale e così via. Se fossi un americano che l'ha votato per la sua campagna elettorale sarei decisamente deluso.

Sullo scandalo dalle intercettazioni il discorso è lungo, forse su questi lidi l'avevo già affrontato, non mi ricordo. Il nocciolo è che già si sapeva, ma che questo non lo rende meno grave né corretto, e soprattutto non ha nulla a che vedere con l'HURR DURR TERRORISM ALLAH BILLADEN che i mangiahamburger tentano di portare come giustificazione. Ora che lo scandalo si estende anche all'Europa, è normale che paesi come la Germania (dove con la privacy non ci scherzano, anche a livello legale) entrino in modalità berserk e minaccino la rottura dei rapporti commerciali con l'America. Perché, nonostante tutte le belle parole di Obama, si è uno scandalo e si è oltraggioso che la self proclaimed land of the free si riduca a questo.

In the west Iceland has put EU membership on ice (sorry), but it's not completely off the table - mostly a matter of the financial crisis, their fundamental reasons to join remain. Greenland has a lot of choices to make in the near future (melting polar ice, resource extraction, geopolitical alignment) so that's a bit of a wildcard. As for Canada and the USA, their interests lie on the American continent, so unless some wildly speculative turmoil happens that causes political splits everywhere, that's not something that's going to happen.

East. The remnants of Joegoslavia + Albania will join sooner or later. 

As for the traditional sphere of influence of Russia (Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Transdniestria), they are trying to get the best of both world by straddling the fence between Russia and EU, but as they should know from historical experience that the fence between Russia and the rest of Europe is no safe place. They'll opt for closer ties with either side at some point. Obviously the EU is the easier choice to do that.

The Caucasus: Armenia is considered aligned with Europe already due to being Christian. They're also small countries that aren't likely to disrupt much, and there's oil. Against them pleads the fact that they're a lot deeper in Asia. Neither Russia nor Turkey would like meddling in their backyard. Violence still isn't far away, and there are unresolved territorial disputes.

Turkey: the situation as it is will likely continue for a while: slow progress on the legislative side, while nothing decisive happens on the three unresolved conflicts: Armenia, Cyprus, the Kurds.

Russia: Too big. Even if it joins, there will be an exception for most rules east of the Ural, and Russia is not wont to divide itself internally. And that's ignoring the autocratic tendencies and militarism of Russia. On the flip side, these weaknesses would be strengths as an ally because they complement EU weaknesses in the geopolitical arena.

Southeast: given the turmoil and geopolitical antagonism in that area, forget it.

But, the question is bigger than that - what is the long term strategy? To endlessly pay for France's farming? To evaluate what works and what doesn't?

It most certainly does, at least for some areas of the CAP. Maybe not for the subvention, but some areas *are* called rural development. So, if France haven't managed to develop those areas in + 40 years, we should at least quit rural development. Otherwise, what project that haven't succedeed in + 40 years are you still willing to support? 


&gt;or if certain post like wine and tobacco were to be reduced, the french government would simply give less money to the EU and use that money to subvention it's agriculture on it's own. And then that would be a huge blow to the Common Market. (I used France as an exemple cause that the obvio

No, I don't think so. First, they are not legally allowed to pay less just because *their* pet projects get scrapped. I mean, how would that look? Finland doesn't get one of their pet project OK'd, so they refuse to pay? Not even France can get away with that, apart from it being arrogant, ignorant and illegal as hell. Do you really think Germany and UK would stand for that? 

&gt; And then that would be a huge blow to the Common Market.

And, it is illegal as hell. We can not sponsor our own agricultual industry. That is one of the points with CAP, so if France does that, it will be illegal and against free trade. I have no doubt that other countries, like the UK or the Netherlands would take them to court. France still decides far to much when it comes to the CAP, but not even France can just ignore the other 27 countries, the courts etc. 

I however would love the trial, it would expose how bad the CAP is, and how it is tailored towards France's needs. 

&gt;So maybe the CAP shouldn't be seen as a part of the EU budget, but a way for the countries to keep an eye on each others subvention?

Well, I am all for that  -let each country take care of their own agriculture, I have absolutely no problem with that. But, as long I have to pay for French wine and Polish tobacco and the ""devleopment"" of rural Italy (which they haven't managed in + 40 years) I *will* care about the CAP, it is the biggest post of the budget, and it size is idiotic, not to mention many of the things it subsidizes.

I admit that the peak around 2000 was caused by optimism and  by high grain prices in the world market. An random search on the internet suggest that the price fell in 2009, but interestingly it has started rising again lately. (I don't know if the data are trustworthy)

http://makanaka.wordpress.com/2011/04/29/grains-market-report-2011-april-igc-highlights-volatile-trading/

Perhaps the conclusion is that Danish farmers receive fairly little CAP, and therefore the soil price seems to follow the grain price. If the price of grain rises again, then we can afford to lose the rest of the CAP fairly quickly. (I don't have numbers) 

It could be interesting to see a graph of soil prices for France and Italy. I would expect the soil prices in these countries to be less correlated with the world grain price.

true,wernermuende,,Münster,"You have to realize that protestantism is more diverse than catholicism. So the protestants can hardly be described as one group. 

From my personal experience, the main difference has to do with Karneval.  Carnival is (mostly) restricted to catholic areas as it died out in the protestant areas except in the south west.  Carnival is basically a week of public drunkeness and more or less non stop all out debauchery. Basically, protestantism has a hard time dealing with fun. Catholics might have weirder traditions and strict theologically deduced rules concerning all things bodily, but in my experience they also have a tendency not to actually give a fuck because all is forgiven while in protestantism forgiveness might be harder to achieve. The protestant work ethic is very visible in the south west. But to be honest, quite a lot of these people listed as catholic or protestant are nothing but paper christians. Most ""catholics"" I know don't even know the official doctrine of the curch, they are in it for tradition and some sort of spiritual yearning, some of those even work for the church...

I think that's a very unfair generalization. There's a dislike, of course, understandably so since we were at war up until ~17 years ago, and even that is considerably less present in my generation.
We don't hate the Serbs, nor are Serbs who live in Croatia oppressed or anything, at least to my knowledge. For heaven's sake, I've had Serb neighbours in my building all my life and there's never been a case where anyone's nationality caused any sort of issue.

Of course, there are more extreme people who do hate them, but that'd be delinquents, some more extreme football fans, etc.
Normal, sound-minded people like my father, who fought in the war by the way, would never discriminate against someone based on their nationality, nor would they stand idly by if they saw their children behaving in that fashion.

On the whole, all Croatians want is to improve the state of our country and live peacefully with the rest of the world, and I think it's important for foreigners to know that.

These postdate Russia's westernization, not to mention that Russia is quite a lot bigger than Turkey. So at a fraction of the size and a fraction of the time you can obviously expect but a fraction of the inventions etc.

&gt;Besides you're missing the point here. The territory isn't as important as the population.

Hey, you brought it up.

&gt;The important thing is that 3/4 of Russia's population is European, with European culture which cannot be said about the Turks.

... they have been dealing with Europe for half a millenium. They had an alliance with the Netherlands in the war of independence, people from all over Europe served in their military and sailed in their navies.

true,thatfool,EURO,European Union,"My impression is that ""European"" has never been about geography at all, and that it's purely about cultural and political compatibility. Keep in mind that the EU was never meant to be a union of countries strictly located on the European continent. It was created to pacfiy Europe, but the conflicts that it was meant to avoid have never been limited to the continent. 

Obviously, there's a bunch of countries left that are actually in Europe, but don't currently want to be part of the EU. Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Liechtenstein would probably be accepted very quickly if they decided to join.

Then there are certain countries that the EU is currently actively pursuing, including former Yugoslavia (hello Croatia, btw.) and Turkey. All of these would internalize border conflicts between the EU and neighboring states. Economically and culturally, they're all very close, although Turkey could do a 180 still. Either way it seems very likely to me that these will all end up in the EU at some point in the future.

But then, what's next? The core of Europe is part of the EU already. Eastern neighbors like Belarus or Ukraine seem to be relatively unimportant and also not necessarily compatible yet, with neither side willing to put more effort into making them compatible. Integrating Russia would be economical and geopolitical madness, and Russia has no reason of her own to join. 

Outside Europe, another priority I see in the future is further expansion around the Mediterranean. We don't have to wait for Norway or Switzerland and so on; there are countries outside Europe that are strategically interesting for the EU and culturally and politically close. 

In Africa, there's Morocco. It applied in 1987 and was rejected, but Turkey was rejected then too, and Morocco has made large improvements toward compatibility. It's easily the most privileged partner of the EU in Africa right now, with ENP advanced status, free trade, open skies, and so on. It's also not in the African Union, and it's a NATO ally. Accession of Morocco would internalize a border conflict with Spain, and give the EU full control over the Strait of Gibraltar. Currently, the EU has territories on both sides of it, with Ceuta on the African side, and the accession of Morocco would give the EU full control over one of the most important avenues for illegal immigration as well as an important trade route.

The rest of Africa seems unlikely. Algeria technically was a member of the EC until its secession from France. They aren't anywhere close to compatibility with the EU right now, though, and the same applies to pretty much all of North Africa. Morocco is the exception.

Then there's the Middle East. Israel would not be terribly unlikely. Culturally, it's obviously much closer to Europe than to its neighboring countries. The idea is not unpopular within Israel, and has been discussed in the EU as well. Currently this doesn't look to be happening anytime soon, but if the EU is going to expand in that direction at all, Israel is the most likely candidate. Among the Arab countries, Jordan is probably the most likely, but then they are all not terribly likely due to the huge cultural differences.

And that's about it. A case could be made for certain Commonwealth of Nations states, but pretty much all of them would require a significant re-definition of the EU. India probably has the closest ties with the EU, but an integration of India isn't really manageable and I don't really see what's in it for India that they can't get out of a strong partnership. IMHO we're more likely to see the UK leave the EU in favor of a Commonwealth based union of its own... which will then fail for the same reasons for which the British Empire failed, but that's another story.

Oh, right, there are some special cases involving territories outside Europe that are part of EU member states. I guess any of them could become fully parts of the EU very quickly, or become independent of their EU parent, but that's not terribly interesting. Their citizens are already EU citizens and so on, they just get special treatment to facilitate trade with geographically close neighbors. They could go in either direction without any huge process required. We have cases like that in Europe too, Germany and Italy have exclaves in Switzerland that are not part of the EU VAT union, the Channel Islands are special, Åland is special, and so on. If Switzerland joins the EU after all, the exclaves will be fully integrated as well, but nobody really cares enough about any of these to pursue a change of status.

**TL;DR** If the EU doesn't fail, all of continental Europe will eventually end up in it. Outside Europe, Morocco and Israel seem to be the most likely candidates, but it's not going to happen soon. I don't think we'll see any further expansion outside Europe unless the definition of the EU changes significantly.",0,1372682279,null,0,false,0,catqf1s,t3_1hdqhj,t1_catqf1s,t3_1hdqhj,null,1430622164,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Denmark do not get enough for their pork and wind energy, so they get to decide to pay less? is that how it works, because then the other eight of us want to pay less too. If you can, so can we.  And, don't think at least the UK and Germany will not try. Does France really think the Germans enjoy paying the cost for their wines while the Germans get less? 


Besides, the whole bloody CAP is tailored after French needs anyway- I think the question should be why aren't you net payer in that too- what make France so special? The fact that France is thinking they can get away with it is a sign of how behind they are and how extremely arrogant. If France haven't realised it, the CAP is getting lower and people dislike it. The fact that France think it is ok to subsidise alcohol with other people money is abhorrent to me. Sponsor liver diseases and lung cancer. 


The fact that France still want to squeeze money from this and refuse to adjust will be your downfall.  France is loosing in importance and if they at least were supporting sensible schemes, they would perhaps convince someone.  Instead France's arrogantly continues to ask for money for stupid stuff like wine/tobacco and refusing even a hint of market adjustment. Furthermore, defending non working schemes like rural development is idiotic.  It is  arrogant and hurt the French people as well in the long run. 

Again, I hope France get taken to court if it does something because at least in the newspapers I can read from other net payers, there is rarely a defence for the French position. 

I know you do not personally take any money, but as long as 44 % of the budget goes to the CAP, dictated by France I will fight it. It is idiotic.  ",0,1372682290,null,0,false,0,catqf4c,t3_1hdqhj,t1_catqf4c,t1_catq753,null,1430622164,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm not mentioning hooligans as a way to deflect the issue, my point is that I don't see any hatred in mainstream media and mainstream culture, meaning the heavy majority of the population, which IS what matters most.

Anyways, yeah, with time, negative sentiment will probably fade. In any case, the best cure for hatred isn't really older generations dying(not that it doesn't help), but education and actual contact with people. That's why things like the Internet are great, not just for our two countries, but globally.

P.S.
I'm kind of allergic to the mention of nationalism. That is, I'm allergic to people misinterpreting patriotism for nationalism, in the sense that patriotism is just being proud of one's heritage, and nationalism is considering one's heritage to be superior for one reason or another, or any cause for negative discrimination.

I actually don't think our young generations are that nationalistic, though there are certainly exceptions, and maybe I live in a bubble of higher education.

**DO NOT go for the Paris Viste metro pass, as suggested by others.**  It's much more expensive than it needs to be.  Instead go for the **Mobilis**, which is much cheaper and effectively the same thing (unlimited day pass).  The difference is that the Visite includes discounts at some museums, but you have to go to a LOT of museums to make it worth the added cost.  With the Mobilis, you pick your zones (go with Zones 1 &amp; 2, which is cheapest (around 6 Euro), unless you're going to Versailles that day in which case go with Mobilis Zones 1 &amp; 4).  The Mobilis is roughly the equivalent of 3-4 regular tickets, so if you're going to take less than 4 metro trips in one day, just buy individual tickets.   When riding public transport, make sure to keep your pass on you at all times, sometimes guards are there to check passes and also sometimes you have to use it to get out of the station.  You'll get fined and forced to pay on the spot if you don't have it.  Also don't put it in your wallet or near keys, coins, credit cards, etc.  The metal will desensitize your tickets and make them useless.  Happens to almost all of my friends who come to visit me here.  Devote one pocket solely to metro tickets and don't put anything else in there.

With Versailles, the best ways to get around the garden are renting bikes or golf carts.  You can rent the golf carts near the entrance to the gardens, and you can rent the bikes down by the Grand Canal.  The gardens are HUGE and too much to walk, IMO.  With the carts and the bikes you can see much more and save your feet a bit.  You can also rent rowboats on the Grand Canal which is fun.  If you're not going in the chateau you can bring wine and food in with you and have a picnic on the grounds, or you can bring the picnic stuff with you and go to the gardens first, then go back to the chateau later when the line to get in is shorter.  There is also a behind the scenes tour of Versailles that takes you through the private royal apartments.  It's 25 Euro which includes a ticket to the chateau and gardens.  Personally I think it's worth it, it was REALLY cool and you get to completely skip the (long) line to get in, but you do have to reserve in advance on the Versailles website. 

Sorry for the shameless plug, but I have a vacation-planning blog for Paris with a lot of good tips.  You can check it out at www.lamourdeparis.com.  Has some advice on what to see, where to eat, how to get around, etc.  Might be useful for you!

Other good day/overnight trips are Giverny (Monet's Gardens), Mont Saint Michel, Loire Valley chateaux, and the Champagne region (Reims or Epernay).  

In town, my favorite attractions are the Opera Garnier (do the tour, it's pretty cool), Montmartre (sit on the steps and people watch, and make sure to stop by Place du Tertre and pick up some locally made art), the Marais (go on Sundays, when it's pretty much the only thing open, and hang out around the Place des Vosges), the Arc de Triomphe (long wait to get in and even longer climb to the top but the views are magical), the Seine (take a boat cruise at sunset or rent a bicycle and follow the bike path along the river), the Tuileries (big garden by the Louvre, great place to people watch or picnic and there's a cool carnival there for the summer), Saint Germain des Pres (picnic in Luxembourg garden, then check out the boutiques and cafes in the evening), Notre Dame (free and the line moves fast, plus the neighborhood around it is interesting - love the flower market).  Also make sure you go to the rooftop deck of either Galeries Lafayette or Printemps, the views are incredible and it's free!  

Have fun!  I moved here last year and I love it, it's such a wonderful city :)  Don't forget to take a couple of days to just wander around without a plan.  That's the best way to enjoy Paris, IMO.  If you have access to a chip-and-PIN card (Bank of America offers one with no annual fees and no international transaction fees, it's called the Travel Rewards card), that will give you access to the city bicycle system, which is really cheap and a great way to get around and save your feet.

Also, plan your meals in advance!!  That is the #1 thing you can do to improve your trip.  There is a lot of amazing, inexpensive food in Paris, but you have to plan ahead and make reservations and/or know where to go.  If you just wait until you're hungry, you may end up going somewhere terrible and overpriced.  You don't have to plan every meal, but definitely do some research and make plans for at least a few great meals.

The point of the article is that you had two groups. The first Cameron claiming defence of the rebate. The second being the people bemoaning British self interest. The EU budget was adjusted so all the richer members lost out but spending in the poorer new members was held. So Britain hasn't defended its rebate in practice. Ironically we are better off with France getting loads of CAP money, it increases the rebate. With the richer members losing out our rebate also goes down.

Well, that goes for every single country in the world, and most certainly the EU. And, if you want to see rural, try northern Sweden and Finland. Money should be thrown at those places, if the only demand is rural.

Hardly an explanation for why France still is one of the biggest receivers.

&gt;EDIT: Bonus projects: ghost airports, highways to nowhere, museum cities, formula one circuits, Calatrava buildings, theme parks... ""serà per diners""

So, *if* the EU were smart, they would evaluate the money that Spain has been given and see what went wrong and not giving out more money to similar projects in other countries, or in Spain. Furthermore, they should set a new strategy for Spain, time frame etc

However, since it is EU I guess we are not spending money on building a highway in Romania, ""rural development"" in France and God knows what in Spain and Portugal.

The little simplified argument I made above is not entirely incorrect though, I believe: a politician will have to balance his ideals *and* his election prospects, otherwise, what good are his ideals if he has no means to realize them?

My main point was this: **even if** I have great doubts about how much politicians like Merkel care about privacy in particular, and civil rights in general, I **am** absolutely sure that she cares (and rightfully so) about the economic develoment of the country that elected her.

&gt;E in tutto questo impariamo che la nostra fame non è solo di pane ma anche di parole che escano dalla bocca dell’altro: abbiamo bisogno che il pane venga noi spezzato e offerto a un altro, che un altro ci offra a sua volta il pane, che insieme possiamo consumarlo e gioire, abbiamo sopratutto bisogno che un Altro ci dica che vuole che noi viviamo, che vuole non la nostra morte, ma al contrario, salvarci dalla morte.

inoltre a voler essere cattivi e a pensar male, la scusa di ""le cesoie le ho in macchina perchè ci lavoro"" è credibile ma è credibile anche ""è andato a prendere il padre per portarlo con la moglie a tenere la bancarella per poter poi andare a manifestare con le cesoie""

Wahre Gerechtigkeit gibt es aber nicht, weil Gerechtigkeitsempfinden nichts weiter als eine sehr subjektive Emotion ist. Glücklicherweise ist unsere Gesellschaft so weit entwickelt, dass bei der Bestimmung des Strafmaßes idealerweise nur die objektive Beweislage (inkl. ""elitärer"" wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnisse) eine Rolle spielt. 

Das ist natürlich eine Auffassung, die man vertreten kann. Sie wird eben nur nicht unserer derzeitigen Lebenswirklichkeit gerecht. So ist ja z.B. auch Erdogan ein demokratisch legitimiertes Staatsoberhaupt, das sogar die gute Hälfte der Bevölkerung hinter sich weiß. Und auch Stuttgart 21, Polizeieinsätze bei Demonstrationen wie in Frankfurt usw. sind formalrechtlich wasserdicht und demokratisch legitimiert. Ein Problem mit dem wir jedoch in unserer Zeit konfrontiert sind, ist das diese formale demokratische Legitimation nicht mehr ausreicht. Und hierfür gibt es verschiedene Gründe: die geringe Wahlbeteiligung, das Bild des Berufspolitikers, die hohen Hürden für eine politische Beteiligung durch alle Gesellschaftsschichten usf.

Insofern, könnte ich deine eingangs zitierte Stellungnahme wie folgt kommentieren: Du möchtest geistig zurück in die 50er Jahre. Das ist aber genausowenig möglich.

The point is that language is a living thing, it flows and changes constantly, and without political ties and forced standardization languages tend to drift apart and not together.

&gt;*Ora, capisco che secondo la nostra cultura cattolica il danaro è una variabile di cui non si dovrebbe tenere conto, ma, avendo fatto per anni il direttore delle risorse umane per una multinazionale americana, vi posso assicurare che le professionalità o le paghi o non le trovi. O meglio: meno le paghi e meno ne trovi, perché – senza moralismi – è legittimo aspirare, oltre che alle responsabilità e alla eventuale fama, anche a un equo corrispettivo per il lavoro che si fa. Certo, ci sono anche persone capacissime disponibili a lavorare gratis, ma io credo che l’interesse pubblico sia quello di attrarre i migliori in assoluto e non quello di pescare, per posizioni di responsabilità, solo tra coloro dotati di una specifica vocazione al volontariato.*",0,1372696012,null,0,false,0,catu6m1,t3_1hd8an,t1_catu6m1,t1_cats1s7,null,1430620373,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"Just to clarify, immigrating is not the same thing as becoming a citizen. I'm an American who moved to Germany with my family when I was a teenager and then just stayed. I've been here 10 years now and am in the process of becoming a German citizen. The first thing you should know is that in order to become a German citizen you need to renounce your US citizenship and that's not something easy or to be taken lightly. Germany is absolutely my home and where I want to stay and raise a family, but there are times when it's still difficult even after all these years. It's easy to underestimate the challenges of living in a country where the language will always be your second and not necessarily understanding how things are done. A lot of people take for granted the ease of knowing exactly how to get something done, where to buy certain things or even what things are required. 

In terms of difficulty, it's more just a long process than anything. You can't just move here and bam apply for citizenship. There are years of living, working and paying into the social system required before you can gain permanent residency and the right to apply to become a citizen. You also need to account for the difficulties of renouncing your US citizenship, which isn't exactly cheap, especially if you qualify for the expatriation tax. 

The job climate really depends on your field and qualifications. A random US bachelors degree probably won't help you too much.

 It is also very ethnically nationalistic. While you could probably excuse people for disliking immigrants, but then there is the northern Caucasus where there is indeed hardly any rule of law or due process to speak about, the NC Republics are ruled thought presidents - mostly coming from high military ranks who are in a sort of feudal relationship with the RF president - they insure stability and loyalty while cracking down on terrorists, some of them using their own militias like Kadyrov, some with Cossacks - former farmers/colonists/militia in the imperial times, most of whom are religious fundamentalists, and in return have high degree of autonomy. Many people think that caucasus is being disproportionally funded by the federal government.

 It's also hardly a democracy, even if we leave aside questions about corruption and fraud, there are simply far too little occasions for Russians to vote or decide anything for themselves not to mention rampant cynicism and absenteeism. Remember the Medvedev was able to change the presidential term outlined in the constitution without consulting the people at all.

 Russians are also very prone to conspiracy thinking, many see themselves under threat from NATO, human-rights organistions, gays (regardless of political affiliation or religiosity most people think that it's contageous) western values, caricaturely portrayed as rampant egoism and immorality - Russia resembles the ME in that regard.

The biggest retriever of Spain is the House of Alba. They retrieve more than the total salaries paid by the House. The current head is the richest woman of Spain. The primary sector and the food industry in Spain need a big modernization process like the one that France has had these years.

And France has used the founds better than us. They modernized they farms actually. An example: France is exporting milk to Spain. The european founds have been an extra income for a lot of farmers in Spain and used  mostly for modenization in France.

Yes, this is a ""complot"" (a conspiracy), Assange had a very nice essay on conspiracies in the modern world and how to make them harder through transparency.

However, the US probably has the power to have the widest spying network, but do not underestimate other surveillance networks. I know we have a small one (google ""frenchelon"" for more information) but also China probably has a very nice one. Their hardware is everywhere, in every strategical network facility. Their security is (voluntarily?) so weak that it is easy to enter in many places. And the budget of their surveillance agency is probably comparable to NSA's, though it is probably symmetric in its interest : they mainly spy on Chinese citizens, but not the other way around.

USSR has a lot of competent security expert, so you can assume they also intercept all the communications they can. 

The thing is, the task is much easier for USA as it is home of the company we feed our data too : Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon (who ousted wikileaks and now hosts... reddit!), etc...

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"(FAZ isn't Springer, that would be Die Welt.)

In my opinion, Süddeutsche, Zeit and FAZ all do a good job at being politically neutral, but are traditionally seen as in that order from left to right (you could even extend this to be followed by Die Welt). Especially when I compare it to the newspaper landscape in the UK, where The Independent, The Guardian, The Times and The Telegraph span a much wider spectrum. OK, we have Taz as a bit of an outlier, but I'd say even Frankfurter Rundschau on the one side and Die Welt on the other aren't further apart as The Guardian and The Times (which, despite being Murdoch, does a fine job).  

Anyway, you're right that the FAZ is closer to classic liberalism than to the kind of conservatism that makes you think ""Bismarck"", but for obvious reasons, German conservatism has lost much of it's ""nationalist edge"". From Adenauer to Kohl, there was a strong commitment to European integration and internationalism. The entire policy concept of Social Market Economy was introduced under the CDU. Nowadays it expresses itself more in a bias towards personal security and social conformism over personal liberties, economic liberalism over social security and through complaining about noisy neighbors. You know, a desire for public order and a liking for traditional values (*Spießertum, Biedermeierei*). Transatlanticism and a pro-Israel slant are conservative attributes as well, within the context of the modern German political landscape. What's left of the nationalism of yore is a bias towards pragmatism over idealism on the international stage as far as the ""national interest"" is concerned.  
It's all much less pronounced than it used to be, I only added the ""moderate-conservative"" attribute because I don't expect everyone in this subreddit to be familiar with FAZ. Context wise, it would have been very different had this particular piece been published in Taz or, to use a more extreme example, Junge Welt.

When you go as far back as Bismarck, the modern political spectrum breaks down. Neither Bismarck nor August Bebel would fit in the modern political mainstream, but they defined their respective camps at the time. There are no modern Monarchists and preciously few remaining Marxists, were they alive today they would probably vote CDU and SPD (yeah, it's kinda obvious in Bebel's case).  
There are good reasons to despise Bismarck, but it's hard not to have respect for the guy. To say that his network of alliances forged in secret diplomacy has caused a lot of problems would be an understatement, and the way he baited France into declaring war as a means to unify the German states might not quite be up to modern ethical standards (textbook case of war as the ""continuation of politics by other means""), but as a (real-)politician, he was brilliant.  
In Germany, Max Weber to this day is your best-bet answer if you get asked something in sociology class and haven't been paying attention, much like the Preservation of Energy is in physics.  
Zweig's *Schachnovelle* was one of the best books I've read in school, but I have to admit that I've never (knowingly) read anything by Stürmer despite having lived around the corner from his house for a while. In any case, I'd be very surprised if he hadn't been published in FAZ' feuilleton throughout his career, which is considered separate from the news section anyway.

Mia sorella aveva 6 anni e conserva solo qualche vago ricordo, ma posso testimoniare che si è quasi offesa per l'interruzione della Melevisione. Io e mio fratello, poco più grande di me, sulle prime non comprendemmo la portata dell'attentato e ci precipitammo giubilanti al piano di sopra dove svegliammo i nostri manco che fosse la mattina di Natale.

Qualche ora dopo viene un amico a casa e mentre parliamo casualmente di quello che era successo, sentiamo un rumore fortissimo di turbine provenire da fuori.

La France, mine de rien, fait un gros effort sur les sports collectif**s** féminin**s**, je trouve. En Hand, en foot, en rugby, en basket, on obtient plutôt de bon**s** résultat**s**. L'exemple le plus frappant est le foot, o**ù** les filles sont plus qu'un cran au-dessus des mecs. 

Si on parle de retransmission**s**, faut pas croire que les mecs sont à une meilleure enseigne dans plein de sports. Le Hand n'est pas vraiment bien diffusé, alors que les droits sont pas très élevés, et que c'est l'equipe la plus primée de toute l'histoire du sport collectif français. 

Et on pourrait aussi parler de l'handisport...

Actually, I'd say the analogy is calling Scots British, after the UK got dismembered through a civil war. Scots, English, Welsh are like Croat, Serb and Bosniaks. British and Yugoslav are a sort of superidentity. So is Scandinavian.

Or maybe Irish, since they don't like being lumped together with the Brits, although being quite British in a sense.

I really meant no offence, but it is a way of seeing Croatia for people here. A lot of people still talk about ""Yugoslavs"" when refering to ""Western Balkan Slavs"". Also keep in mind that unlike Croat, Serb and Bosnian nationalisms, a lot of other national identities focus around a language, so many people assume that if 3 groups speak the same language they are 3 flavors of the same people (I know it's not the case).

Croatia's currency is the kuna, but many people prefer to open bank accounts in euro.

Beautiful villages; the cities instead are sometimes a little grim.

Great food, if you stay away from the large hotels on the coast.

Kraš sweets dotted my childhood. Ice cream in Croatia instead sucks (imho).

But maybe you are referring to our tax system (Steuerklassen = tax categories). 

Let me briefly explain it: Once you marry and both partners have an income, you can (as far as I remember) decide, which income goes into which tax category. The category defines the tax rate (for one category it's higher, for the other one it's lower). So if you are not a total moron, you chose the lower tax rate for the higher income, which (in the past couple of decades) most of the time was the husbands income. Therefore, the wifes income fell into the ""higher tax"" category - ergo: lower net income). 

I'm not sure if that is what you meant, but if so: It has absolutely nothing to do with the gender of the taxpayer.

 
Edit: Just to clarify - If the wife earns more than her husband, you would chose the low tax rate for her and the husband would have his income ""reduced""",0,1372707561,null,0,1372707798,0,catygqt,t3_1hg07w,t1_catygqt,t3_1hg07w,null,1430618284,16,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,16

It is called rural *development* not rural *support*. if it hasn't developed in 40 + years, and they are still top receivers, then it is something wrong. Then it is not developing. Also, it depends on how you count, if you count the Swedish way, we would get way more (frankly, have you been north in Sweden? The size of Western Germany with two million people). We need rural development far more than someone who can actually drive a few miles to a city/hospital, whatever. However, of course it is tailored after France's needs - why, btw?

I tuoi compagni di seminario come hanno reagito alla tua decisione? E la tua famiglia?

J'avoue que je regarde les 3/4 des sports sans les commentaires, voir même sans le son. D'abord parce que ma chere compagne s'en tape le coquillard d'un match de basket ou de hand, donc je regarde sur l'ordi, (elle veut bien regarder le foot si des equipe nationale sont en lice et certains matchs de coupes) et secundo, je ne vais pas mettre des écouteurs pour entendre des choses stupides. De plus je trouve que l'on comprend mieux en regardant qu'en écoutant. Les commentaires sont rarement interressants, et comme tu le souligne, on tombe facilement dans un genre que je qualifierais de ""remarques de comptoir"". Un peu de racisme, de sexisme, des blagounettes et pratiquement jamais de choses pertinentes sur la tactique, peu de stats, c'est juste frustrant.

Question argent et retransmissions, le foot est loin devant, c'est certain, mais que **c**e soit en version mâle ou femelle. Apres on doit trouver le rugby (mais là les filles ne sont plus vraiment là), le basket et le hand (là, on retrouve les filles), mais par rapport au foot, ils se partagent les miettes. Mais bon on peut pas non plus diffuser tout les sports sur un pied d'égalité. Combien de sport passent à la trappe? Volley, hockey (gazon, glace), le kin-ball, le water-polo et puis j'en passe et des meilleurs.

Je pense que justement, il y peut-être un truc en France, un certain amour du sport, gratuit, comme ça, pour le plaisir, qu'on retrouve dans le fait qu'on peut pratiquer enormement de sports. Bien sur, le baron de Coubertin était sexiste, et même raciste, mais replacé dans l'époque, on était dans une norme.

On a peut-être le rêve d'être les meilleurs partout, mais si déja on est pas trop mauvais en tout, je trouve ça formidable. Je préfére la diversité à l'elitisme. Quand je vois le foot US, je n'ai pas honte de notre foot européen. Je n'imagine pas une seule seconde une ligue de rugby ou de foot en sous-vêtement, même si cela a peut-être existé (ou existe), eux le font sous des pretextes com**m**erciaux, mais à part colporter une image sexiste, je n'y vois aucun intérêt.

Ero già molto in crisi ed avevo chiesto al vescovo di interrompere gli studi per provare a ricostruire la vocazione facendo un po di pastorale normale. Abbiamo collaborato molto. All'inizio la stima, poi la simpatia, alla fine mi sono innamorato. Ci siamo innamorati abbastanza contemporaneamente, anche se all'inizio ero molto più preso io. Quando ce lo siamo detto, abbiamo provato per un po' a non vederci, ma molto presto ho capito che io in ogni caso volevo lasciare.
- La famiglia non l'ho messa intorno a un tavolo. Ne ho parlato a uno a uno e ognuno ha avuto reazioni diverse dall'evviva alla chiusura più totale. Oggi, grazie a Dio, abbiamo ricostruito il rapporto con tutti.
- Quando sono andato a parlare con vescovo gli ho ricordato che già gli avevo detto un anno prima della mia crisi, che allora non conoscevo ancora quella che oggi è mia moglie né avevo nessun tipo di relazione sessuale o affettiva. Il vescovo non aveva molto da dirmi perché io, pur essendo romano, ero stato ordinato in Polonia, quindi quasi non mi conosceva. L'impressione che ho avuto è che non gliene importasse molto.
-La crisi è cominciata in seminario. Io venivo da un ambiente molto secolarizzato e di sinistra e per me era difficilissimo accettare le tradizioni gli usi i modi di porsi dell'ambiente clericale. Sono andato avanti illudendomi che nel mio seminario si stesse formando un nuovo tipo di prete, fuori dagli schemi. La prima durissima botta, però l'ho ricevuta a Varsavia dove ero stato vice parroco per due anni e hanno deciso di farmi tornare a Roma per fare un dottorato in patrologia. In quel momento ho capito che lasciare le persone della parrocchia cui ero affezionato era come  strapparmi qualcosa dentro. L'ultimo anno ho capito che non ero più disposto a lasciarmi coinvolgere nella pastorale per paura di  affezionarmi e dover rivivere lo strappo. A quel ponto non potevo non andarmene. (questa risposta è ancora più delle altre una generalizzazione, ché servirebbe un libro per rispondere, non poche righe)
- Sono certo che Gesù Cristo è Dio. Sono certo che la Chiesa sono quelli che credono in lui. Non riesco ancora a trovare il modo di vivere la fede in una parrocchia. Sono convinto che il 99% della gerarchia è composto da disadattati.

Expensive parts are the rent (in particular in Berlin/Munich) and general cost of living.

Difficult will be getting into the university, an example for the requieremts can be found [here](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/students/degree/admission_info/admission_non_eu/appinfo_noneu/index.html) (LMU- Munich university, one of the best in germany). The rquirements usually include some certificate on german fluency (if they do not, it porbably is an ""elite"" thing, and the other requirements are higher).

I do not know about Visa requiremetns.


Lastly: German universities are difficult and hard. You can easily drop out. In particular in sciences or engeneering.

Try your luck. 


EDIT: On subjects: Medicine and law are difficult, as admission is regulated by the state. 

&gt;dance or film 

I cannot help you on that - I am the opposite (I study physics and computer science). Also, getting a degree in these subjects does not guarantee a good job. But someone with said degree can probably elaborate.

I would still recommend doing it (except maybe if you have to take credits to do it...), even if just for the experience. Also, these subjects are less intensive, you can probably work part time to earn some money.

Un peu de racisme, de sexisme, des blagounettes et pratiquement jamais de choses pertinentes sur la tactique, peu de stats, c'est juste frustrant.

Sur ça...c'est très subjectif hein, évidemment que je me souviens de Thierry Roland...et Pierre Menez n'est pas fin non plus mais je ne le regarde pas du tout, j'ai juste entendu par hasard.

 Je regarde assez peu le sport, le plus souvent c'est sur france télé pour roland garros ou les JO, la gym, l'althlétisme.. et ils ont l'air de se faire critiquer méchamment assez régulièrement alors que je les trouve pas particulièrement beaufs, racistes ou sexistes. Moi qui prends tout ça assez à cœur j'ai pas le souvenir d'avoir été choquée par un commentateur de france télé récemment. (Exceptions notables de Candeloro et de Nelson Montfort, mais lui est tellement maladroit/con qu'il me fait rire, c'est peut être une ordure, je le trouve sympathique...Candeloro est juste super lourd en revanche). Mais sinon je trouve les commentateurs de tennis et d'athlétisme sympathiques, en tout cas leurs explications me conviennent bien, ça m'aide à comprendre le jeu, hier c'était pas mal, mais évidemment je ne sais pas pour les téléspectateurs qui s'y connaissent... 
Par contre lors des JO ils recrutent plein de spécialistes pour chaque sport, souvent d'anciens sportifs, et oui c'est vrai que là par contre même en n'y connaissant rien on se rend parfois compte qu'ils sont nuls, mais bon l'intention est assez logique tout de même, difficile de le leur reprocher et y a toujours un vrai journaliste sportif en binôme avec le/a sportif/ve.

Juste pour finir tout ça donc: hier encore le commentateur à un moment a lancé ""oh elles sont chaudes les espagnoles......si je puis me permettre"": vraiment on sentait bien que c'était sorti tout seul, qu'il n'y avait pas d'arrière pensée et j'ai trouvé ça dommage qu'il se sente aussitôt obligé de se corriger pour éviter toute critique... après j'en sais rien, peut être qu'il est sexiste, qu'il l'a déjà prouvé par le passé, j'en sais rien je ne le connais pas, mais j'ai tendance à penser que non et c'est pas la première fois que je suis un peu dérangée par l'impression qu'ils se contrôlent tous un peu trop alors qu'ils ne me semblent pas particulièrement à la ramasse.",0,1372711851,null,0,false,0,cau03kv,t3_1hfqxa,t1_cau03kv,t1_catz9ml,null,1430617514,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

The English word meat isn't very clearly defined.  It's a good question!  I polled my American friends on Facebook to see whether they felt the category meat includes fish, and it was about 50/50.  So I guess the less is that there's never been a clear definition, and it's always important to be as specific as possible about your definition, because definitions vary so much.

Thus, companies are less inclined to hire freshly married women, which might result in a lower pay on average.

Hai aneddoti particolari/esemplificativi da raccontare?

Io dall'interno ho visto solo le parrocchie. Solo che a un certo punto ho smesso di non voler vedere quello che succede in vaticano e sta su tutti i giornali, dal rapporto di Giovanni Paolo II con lo IOR, alla scelta di obbligare i vescovi a presentare le dimissioni a 75 anni (o è un padre e allora non si dimette o è un manager e allora la smettano di menarla col buon pastore). Poi non sopportavo più il buonismo ipocrita (accogliete gli emigrati me lo può dire don Gallo e quelli come lui, non uno che vive da solo in un appartamento di 200 metri quadrati) Nel mio piccolo ho conosciuto un paio di preti che erano stati in gamba veramente, spremuti come limoni e poi buttati in un angolino per le logiche di potere delle loro congregazioni.

Per i miei compagni di seminario è come se non fossi mai esistito. (non so se per rispetto delle mie scelte o per diktat dei superiori, perché neppure io li ho cercati)

Si. Se celebrassi i sacramenti sarebbero validi. Ma farei peccato contro la chiesa (banalizzo un po') a meno che non li celebrassi in pericolo di morte

true,FleshyDagger,ESTO,Estonia,"&gt; a flat income tax system of 21%

Speaking of income, the average wage in 2012 was 887 € (gross). For the employer, that cost 1188 €, and the employee received 702 € after taxes. 485 €, or 41% of the salary went to various taxes, mostly as income tax (indeed 21%, or 149 € in this example) and social tax (33%, or 293 €). Is 41% low?

&gt; zero national debt. 

National debt is nothing more than indirect debt of its population. In Estonia's case, the middlemen have been cut off, and while government debt figures are indeed low, the external debt of government+population stands at ~135% of the GDP. 

&gt; no tax on capital gains

This arrangement is widely being used by multinationals to transfer profits out of Estonia untaxed, and no study has ever found any significant positive effects. How lovely.

&gt; the country's economy is growing by more than 10% this past year

3.2%, to be precise. This has slowed down to 1.1% in Q1 2013. 

&gt; Also, many products only have VAT of 9% and others have no VAT.

0% is applied in very limited cross-border circumstances, such as services rendered aboard an international flight.

9% is applied only to some medications, hospitality, and publications (books, newspapers, magazines). Nothing more. The current minister of culture is pushing to exclude publications.

Everything else is taxed at 20%.

Les acquis sociaux sont en effet fragiles, mais les acquis ""sociétaux"", on n'est pas près de revenir dessus en France !

Légalisation de l'avortement, abolition de la peine de mort, majorité à 18 ans: quelque soit l'opposition qu'il y a pu avoir au moment du vote de ces lois, elles n'ont jamais pu être remises en question au moment de l'alternance politique.

Le coût économique de ces mesures est très faible, ce n'est donc pas une crise économique qui va les remettre en cause ! C'est aussi lié à un phénomène récurrent: cette situation où une loi finit par instituer non seulement ce qui est légal ou illégal, mais aussi ce qui est bien ou mal. 

Aujourd'hui, on est contre la peine de mort d'abord parce que c'est illégal, alors qu'au moment du vote de l'abolition, 60% de la population française était favorable à la peine capitale. Cette propension de la loi à légitimer ce qu'elle légalise a aussi ses inconvénients: ça dispense d'avoir une réflexion approfondie sur le sujet.

So, either some country must convince Germany that they're prepared to take this short-term extremely unbearable pain for the long-term semi-benefit of having their own currency or a bunch of countries must gang up and beat some sense into Germany. 

In the long term, the best joint action is for needless austerity to end and some form of concessions to be made on the part of the surplus regions. But even though this is obvious to all, there is no individual incentive for Germany to play nice.

PS: The author also seems to be under the impression that Tsipras is reliably radical enough to make such a threat.

It's indeed a bit of an unnecessary comment.

2. Well isn't that something that the comment itself also implies?

Indeed. Somewhere in that comment line it does bring up a somewhat necessary topic though. 2 actually.

&gt;WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

The thing is that there's little Americans can do. There's little backlash for any president or governmental organisation when it commits crimes. (Same goes with some European countries.) I think part of the fault for that lies with the 2 party system and also the fact that people seem to be less engaged with those affairs nowadays.

On the other hand I see this other mentality way too often too:

For example, in a discussion about America's faults, Europeans will happily point out that America is the only country to have dropped a nuclear bomb in war; but at the same time that America was dropping nuclear bombs, European states occupied almost all of Africa, Europeans were ethnically cleansing each other in the *millions* across Central Europe, and fascism and communism (invented and embraced by Europeans) were solidifying their control in Europe. While American race slavery is still considered a valid complaint against contemporary America's moral stance because racism still exists in America, apparently the Shoah is *not* a valid complaint against European claims to being tolerant societies, despite the persistence of antisemitism (to say nothing of bigotry against the Roma) in Europe?

In fact, let's talk about the Shoah. Godwin's Law exists because what the Nazis did was so unspeakably awful that comparing other things to it is just an emotional appeal. The corollary to this is that the Shoah--originated by Germans and aided by basically everyone else in Europe except the Poles--was *so awful*, nothing can ever be reasonably compared to it. Americans can't even begin to compete with the totality of horror conceived and perpetrated by Europeans in the lifetime of my grandparents. We've already lost the ""worst shit ever done by humanity"" game, because you've won so spectacularly that we just can't compete. And yet, we're supposed to treat *you* like the Earth's moral compass? Thanks, but no thanks.

Europeans can fuss about how they're *soooo* over violence and war, but the stains of what they've done, and the moral choices they've made, can never be washed out.

It's the fault of the people who listened to your phone calls and conducted espionage against your people. They should be brought to justice.

That's an easy way to wash the hands from the situation. You could as well have said the same to people in Stalin's gulags.

&gt; I would actually trade my right to vote in my home country for the right to vote in america, because america has more (negative) influence here then my own fucking government.

You would be a fool to do something like that.

Voting in the USA is rigged. I'm not even talking about voting irregularities, either-- even though they exist. I'm saying that I can already tell you the results of the next elections-- either a Democrat or a Republican will be elected to the presidency, and either the Democratic or Republican party will have control of the two parts of the legislature. I'm not a rich man, but I will bet everything in my bank account that this will happen (and, by the way, I will be very happy if I lose the bet, but I don't anticipate it happening).

If you think there is any difference between the two parties, you have been talking with too many Americans. Dubya may have been especially an asshole, but the US government has a strong record of atrocities no matter who is in charge.

I don't know if it is naivete, ignorance, or stupidity to think that we could change the situation in the USA by something like voting. The people in the USA I can forgive-- we're fed a steady diet of propaganda and government subsidized corn sugar-- but you guys gave Barack Obama a fucking Nobel Peace Prize. 

There are people in the USA who realize that the US state is a force for evil in the world, but what are we supposed to do? The apparatus of oppression is too strong here, and we are weak.

In Europe, you are much stronger. You can do more!

What can you do? 

Well, you can indict George Bush, Dick Cheney, Barack Obama, and members of the US security apparatus for crimes against humanity and crimes against human rights. Let them stand trial in the Hague.

Close the US embassy in your country and expel US diplomats. Everyone knows that embassies are covers for intelligence agencies. If you value your privacy, kick out the spies at the embassy. It won't stop infiltration of spies on non-official covers, but it will make the job a lot harder.

Kick the US military out of your country. Honestly, do you think the USA has the bases in Germany, Italy, and the UK for the benefit of Europeans?

Instruct your governments not to do business with US corporations. Impose a trade embargo against the USA. Pursue a policy of divestment from US businesses.

These are things than the European Union and member states can do to put an end to US abuses in Europe. You have a larger economy and more people in the EU than we do in the USA, so why not stand up to the US government?

true,l33t_sas,null,null,"&gt;Well science disagrees with you. 

Linguistics is not a pure science, it's part of the humanities as well.  And distinguishing ""languages"" from ""dialects"" from ""communalects"", etc. is not a task that employs the scientific method.  Depending on the linguist, lexicostatistical similarity (generally 80%+), mutual intelligibility and/or cultural-political self-identification have all been used to identify whether a given linguistic variety is a different language from another given linguistic variety.  Different linguists will come to different conclusions (depending on whether one is a ""lumper"" or a ""splitter"") and that's okay.

Also, whatever classifications we as linguists might use with regards to related varieties, you certainly won't find any linguists with the hubris to dictate to members of a given speech community **how they should classify their own language.**  You should really read up on literature on field ethics and methods of community engagement, because frankly,  this isn't the first time I've seen you spouting shockingly unethical bullshit.  You are **harming the enterprise of linguistic field research** and damaging the reputation of linguistic research(ers) by how you engage with people outside of the community of linguists.

I think you're wrong, based on my own interactions with Europeans. I think most Europeans really, truly believe that they are incapable of doing terrible things, and that they are morally superior to those who are doing bad things (that, again, pale in comparison to the unspeakably awful things done by Europeans a generation or two ago).
