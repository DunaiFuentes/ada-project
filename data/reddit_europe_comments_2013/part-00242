true,Shapeshifters,NEWZ,New Zealand,"""Another source of revenue in Tonga has been the sale of Tongan passports. This was the brainchild of a Hong Kong Chinese man, one George Chen, who was asked by the Tongan King for advice on how to raise revenue. ""Sell passports,"" Chen said, knowing that many would be sought after by Hong Kongers who were watching with horror the approach of the People's Republic takeover of the British colony in 1997. For $10,000, someone who was otherwise stateless could become a Tongan Protected Person (T.P.P.) and carry a Tonga passport, which conferred the freedom to travel to any country in the world except Tonga, where a T.P.P. was forbidden to settle.

When some countries rejected the validity of these passports, the King was informed and a new Tongan passport went on sale for $20,000 (or $35,000 for a family of four). This gave the holder Tongan nationality and a right to settle. South Africans and Libyans as well as hundreds of Hong Kong Chinese were quick to snap up these passports. Imelda Marcos bought one, and in the process became a Tongan citizen. In the past seven years this has produced $30 million for Tonga as well as a constitutional crisis. Angry Tongans demonstrated their opposition to the sale of Tongan nationality, called for limitations on the King's powers (he was the one to approve the whole thing) and demanded to know what had happened to the money.""

Have you seen a real war of conquest that was openly said to be a conquest and not disguised as a humanitarian action like Afghanistan and Iraq? That would be historically normal levels of toughness.

I moved the opposite direction. From Hungary to Austria. I have seen the opposite. Any criticism of Roma behavior was suppressed by the liberal media up to 2010 or so. No solution was found for two decade because the official ideology was that minorities can only be victims, therefore there is nothing they should change in their behavior. Most of the media and most intellectuals supported the there is no Roma problem, just a racism problem view. 

I could very simply solve the crime problem of Hungary by caning  type corporal punishments Singapore style, Roma or not Roma. But we are too squeamish for this. Everybody is pissing around the Roma crime problem because they are too squeamish. Sooner or later people will be pissed off enough that they elect some real extremist will not suggest the cane or the whip like I do, but will suggest mass murder. This is really crazy. People are so much afraid of a bit of aggression that they will not do anything until sooner or later things will explode into much more aggression.

Besides a small number of extremists, the levels of aggression are really low, for example, there is not even much of a movement for self defense. I mean for example if a lot of people would say firearms should be liberalized so that Hungarians can shoot Roma burglars now that would be indeed a return to historically normal levels of _cojones_.  But no such thing is happening. All that there is (aside from a few extremist groups) is just loud complaining. 

Bilge in Western nations against immigrants? You crazy? Tribes, nations fought for land for millenia. Now they voluntarily hand over real estate to different nations, tribes, which is almost like voluntarily losing a war of conquest, basically inviting in conquerors, and you find it wrong that some folks are bitter about it? 

Try telling the ancient Athenians, of the Solon types, who were supposedly nice enough folks, that you have this great new idea of handing over a district or two to some Persians who are fleeing from some infighting, grant them citizenship, and if they are too traumatized to work pay them welfare, and see how fast they will laugh you out. They would, correctly, see this as a Persian conquest of those city districts.

Hell, I am always surprised that my neighbors in Austria, whom I see as hosts and I see myself as a guest, are no bitter about me, a Hungarian living here. I think that is mostly because I contribute back to society and I speak the language, but I would always be expecting at least some condescdenscion so I am really surprised when I find none.  Even though I work and pay taxes I feel like cheating, I am enjoying the advantages of a rich society, whose riches my ancestors did not produce. I mean if I earn €1000 at home and move somewhere else and earn €2000 for the same work, there is this feeling I am somehow cheating, I did not deserve this. So I totally would expect the locals to be bitter.

Je refuse de croire qu'on nait naturellement égoïste. Cela n'as rien a voir avec l'étatisme.

&gt;Venons-en au vif du sujet. Le ""MarchéTM"" ? Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce cliche a la con ?

C'est la solution miracle qui résoud tous les problèmes si l'on écoute les libéraux. 

""OK on démonte la sécurité sociale, les allocs chômage tout ça tout ça et on fait quoi pour les handicapés par exemple?"" 

""Ah nan mais le Marché^^TM prendra les choses en main t'inkiet""

&gt;Le liberalisme ce n'est pas ""chacun pour sa gueule et tant pis pour les autres"". 

C'est éxactement ça.

C'est ""ah non mais je paye des taxes pour que l'autre fénéant de branleur de chômeur touche ses ARE quoi, c'est pas normal il a qu'a bosser comme tout le monde lol""

""putain je paie pour la sécu pour que des pauvres puissent se payer une santé, c'est nimpe, ils ont qu'a pas tomber malades ou alors se payer une assurance santé eux même avec les sous qu'ils auraient s'ils étaient pas pauvres lol""

&gt;Ce sont egalement les associations, les clubs, les ONG, etc.

Celle qui ont un itérêt sont bien souvent financées par l'état hein.

&gt;Le liberalisme ne veut pas imposer quoi que ce soit ; c'est justement l'inverse. Tu veux de la retraite par repartition ? Rien ne t'en empeche. Tu veux une securite sociale mutualiste ? Fais comme bon te semble. Tu veux manger bio ? Vas-y. Tu veux monter une entreprise sociale et solidaire dont les travailleurs sont les actionnaires ? Rien ne t'en empeche.

Le Libéralisme veut imposer le Libéralisme aka si tu veux une éducation, être en bonne santé, etc. etc. T'as qu'a avoir de l'argent pauvre con. Solidarité? C'est quoi cette merde jamais entendu parlé lol.

&gt;L'idee que le liberalisme c'est uniquement les multinationales, les fonds de pension et les OGM est une pure invention des socialistes/communistes pour faire peur aux petits enfants.

No, l'idée que le libéralisme est contraire aux valeurs de la république vient du fait que le libéralisme est contraire aux valeurs de la république. C'est pas un complot des cocos que tout le monde peut voir que le libéralisme c'est juste un scindage clair entre les mecs qui ont du pognon et ceux qui n'en ont pas et qui n'ont qu'a crever dans le caniveau.

&gt;Quant a l'idee que les gens ne survivraient pas, quelle blague ! Regarde des pays plus liberaux que la France : Suisse, Singapour, Australie, Nouvelle-Zelande. Pas franchement l'impression que les corps s'entassent dans les rues et que les gens se mangent les uns les autres...

Bien sur, prenons pour exemple 2 paradis fiscaux et deux pays dont la situation géographique est complètement différente de la notre.

T'aurais pu ajouter la Somalie dans des exemples tiens.

And do not think I consider austerity a solution, first hand experience in '90s Shock Therapy, but the lie here is that it is a choice. 

Mistakes were made, in not having savings to spend in bad times, in not giving the ECB the sort of political backing to utilize inflation as a tool(a horrible option in my opinion, in comparison to proper preparation), in allowing the liberal and ""lower-taxation"" arguments to gain such a foothold while the economy was going well, and now in failing to address the situation communally, and instead pointing to Germany as doing too little or too much. 

There were no savings, borrowing during bad times is hard (the reason Romania and Bulgaria have low debt-GDP rations is not good goverment, but no one who'd loan), higher taxation is politically distasteful and refuge in inflation works right up until unions realize that they should be paid in dollars  because now their members can't pay the increasing prices on staples and electricity, so a slower form of political suicide.

Credo che la disciplina e la precisione fanno una nazione prefetta ed effetiva. Pecio', almeno nel settore pubblico, ci saranno di piu' regole. Per chi non segue le regole, ci saranno multe.

La burocrazia e' ridicola. Lo stato paga e paga e 10 persone si occupano per cose ai quali basta uno. Taglio la testa alla burocrazia. Tanti licenziati. Con i soldi che risparmio aumento lo stipendio di quelli che lavorano, e che lavorano bene. Anche, con questo risparmio di soldi posso diminuire le tasse.

Cambio il sistema delle tasse- se sei un cittadino qualunque che lavora e ha la famiglia o ha un'azienda, ti diminuisco le tasse. Se sei le banche, o fai ogni tipo d'attivita similie, ti toglio la pelle. Sei abbastanza ricco, e stai gia' derubando il popolo. Le tasse non devono essere piu' del 30% per i cittadini normali.

Niente assistenza sociale se non sei italiano. Se non sei cittadino italiano, me ne frega di te. Neanche una lira va spesa dal governo. Vale anche per l'assistenza sanitaria.

Se hai un'azienda e vuoi trasferirti all'estero, puoi farlo pero ti toglio la pelle da tasse.

Cacciare gli americani dall'Italia. Via il esercito, i turisti-benvenuti.

Aumentare la pena per ogni crimine. I prigionieri devono lavorare come schiavi. Non possono sedere e mangiare i soldi del popolo. Per ogni attivita' clandestina ci sara non solo prendere la propria liberta, ma anche sanzioni fiscali.

Distruggo la mafia. Letteralmente. Faccio la polizia uccidere i mafiosi in ""incidenti"". Sono una peste e la peste deve essere sterminata.

Il Nord e' molto piu' sviluppato dell Sud. Se la cava meglio. Non penso che sia giusto che quelli che sono piu' succevoli devono pagare per gli altri. Federalsimo. Dalle tasse che la gente paga il 70% rimane nella propria regione. Gli altri 30% vanno al governo centrale per progetti piu' grandi.

L'energia-basta con questa dipendenza. Investiamo sia nell'energia rinovabile, che in quella nucleare. 

L'educazione cambia. Dall'ottava in poi ognuno deve scegliere cosa studiare. Questo non e' dire che non ci sara' piu' la matematica, ma vuol dire che se non ti piace la matematica la studi pochissimo.

Libro e muschetto, fascista perfetto(qui scherzo, eh). Pero seriamente, disciplina, disciplina e tanto lavoro. I professori devono avere i stipendi aumentati-sono loro quelli che preparano il futuro dell'Italia.

Ovviamente ci saranno ispezzioni, spessi e severi. Per chi evade la legge, punizione severa. Per chi e' obbediente-la vita' migliorera'.

Diminuisco i stipendi dei politici. Tanto. 

Non do un soldo al Vaticano.

Fanculo il senato. Una camera basta.

Up until 2005 (when the pro-western leaders took office and decided to join NATO) they were paying for gas at 50$ instead of the current market price at 400$ - saving billions per year. Ukraine's products are getting preferences and perks in Russian market. Russia is the main client of their industry products. Yet, Ukraine's average salaries are more than twice lower than in Russia, the economy is nearing default, and their industry now is just a shadow of what it was in 1990. Which is hilarious as back in early 1990, the main reason for the secession was because their leaders told people Moscow was leeching from Ukraine, and that once they get independence, people in Ukraine will live like in France.

The situation in Ukraine is very different than in most other ex-USSR republics. Ukraine has 17 million native Russian speakers, concetrated in the east and south, where the industry is located. Most of these people want to go east.

I'm sure that EU would be willing to sign the treaty even without Tymoshenko, because the treaty doesn't mention any substantional financial help to Ukraine. It opens Ukraine's market for EU products, and most importantly it makes it impossible for Ukraine to join Putin's Customs Union, which is USSR 2.0. Without Ukraine, Russia will never be as strong. Weak Russia - happy US and EU. The biggest problem for Ukraine with signing the EU treaty is, their industry still uses Soviet technology, and most of their products won't be able to compete in EU or even in their own market. Ukraine's official said they would need 150 billion euros to upgrade the factories so that they would conform to EU standards. Nobody is willing to give or lend them the money. This deal is suicidal for Ukraine. And I haven't even touched possibilities of Russia to cut down on orders from Ukraine and start treating it like most other EU country by not giving any perks. Not to mention that Ukrainians won't be able to work and travel within the EU like the member states.

No suggestion to ""fix the fucking problems"", anyone would think there's nothing wrong with the EU at all listening to you lot. And OP don't buy into the UK europhile tosh that it's the UK alone being a dog in the manger, eurosceptics are on the rise everywhere across the EU member states. The EU is on a slow and steady decline to meet with Washington DC at the bottom of the barrel with single digit approval ratings. Unlike DC though, Brussels doesn't have a constitution, taxes or an army. You do not have legitimacy and you do not have our consent. Indeed, we'd have already left if you filthy europhile scum weren't blocking a referendum with all your power till a time at which you think you can win it with a strategic application of fear-mongering and corporate and taxpayer funded propaganda. You are a democratic disgrace and every time you bastards post outrageous drivel like you have here today it redoubles my commitment to see an end to all this madness.  

Not only is my side right, but we desire our goal far more than you desire yours. In the end you are just political anoraks who want to play with your toys in Brussels with those huge salaries; we on the other hand are citizens. You can't compare something that scurries to something that strides. If you lose you will have a tantrum when the EU ends, but the tears will quickly be dried and you'll move on to a job in the civil service, the UN or an NGO and follow/push the same agendas and obsessions (albeit without the power of a superstate behind you, but probably still with a very tasty salary). If we lose, we lose our democracy. That's why I think we'll win, we've got more skin in the game. Actually, as free democratic  citizens, faced with the annihilation of democracy we have *all* our skin in the game. Most europhiles have the removal costs from Brussels to their home capital city at stake, well boo fucking hoo, cry me a river.  

Even though I think we will win it will be a close run thing indeed as you will use the full power of taxpayer propaganda and outrageous scare tactics to try to keep it together as well as get your pals in big business to keep the racket going. Big business loves how the regulations hamstring their small competitors, ""that's a nice olive oil jug ya got there, it'd be a pity if someone were to regulate it"". Or did you stupid fucks think these regulations are for our own good? I can't fathom the level of naive europhilism it takes to see Brussels as anything but a gigantic shitstorm of corruption. It makes me feel sick just thinking of the putrid illegitimacy of it all.  

tl;dr. Don't pretend there's nothing wrong with the EU, fuck you for implying there isn't and it's all in our imagination because sinister tabloids put the evil thoughts there (because the philosopher kings/pile of spotty faced male teenagers who've never had a real job that are the majority of /r/europe are so much more legitimate and objective than other people). We will hopefully beat you in the end because love of freedom trumps the technocratic paternalistic creeping fascism of the EU.

true,nolok,FRAN,France,"Disclaimer: I'm central-left leaning. I believe our core social contract is good, but it needs to be moved into the 3rd millenium, people live longer, the population is older and things have to be more flexible. But the state should keep taking care of those that need it as long as they do their part to get back in the game. Everything that follows is obviously my opinion.

The Sarkozy's era right wing (UMP) went into an ego trip for friends, then went ""tea party"" stupid, then tried to become far right to get some of the votes they lost back. The old right wing from Chirac and before tries to still exists but they're not succeeding so far. A lot of what the current right wing wants looks roughly like what Cameron does in the UK, and no offense since it looks like you're from there but I think it's crap.

The left wing (Parti Socialiste, in power at the moment) lack the political wing to do the reforms we really need to limit expenses and give more breathing air to our purses because they would need to completely alienate their electorate for that (they believe in a state that takes care of its citizen that needs it, but the system has been made decades ago and never been adapted with its time, so doing it now would be a huge shock - the risk of not doing it being what the right wings offer at the moment, dropping some our key social components all together). As a result they do nothing.

The far left is stupid (""make it impossible to fire people"", ...).

The center had a growth in number in the early 2000 but every time they had to make a decision they were so scared to look too much left or too much right that they didn't make any decision at all.

The green have (or had) a sensible program on quite a few point, but then went crazy on others (""let's drop nuclear and see where this goes !""). They had a lot of votes in European election a few years back but imploded not too long after and have failed to make sense ever since.

In that context, the growth of the far right (Front National) and its populist thematic is no surprise. At the same time, the right wing took a few of the far right ideas for themselves and made them look better/socially acceptable, and Marine Le Pen since in charge of the far right has done a lot of work to make their party much less extremist in appearance. But to give you an idea, merely two weeks ago they had one of their member pretending to be elected in municipal election in a few weeks comparing one of our black minister to a monkey on tv, and if you actually read their program you can see that its core idea didn't change much if at all from the 2002 ""87% votes for Chirac against the far right"" election, they only hide it better.

So there you have it, every other party had its chance and failed so people want to try something else, and the far right put some make up on so it's more acceptable to vote for them. Add to that the core populist and christian group waking up with the gay marriage law, and you have our current situation. 

Frankly I don't know who to vote for, I voted Parti Socialiste the last time but while they keep the talk they failed to act. I won't vote far right because I've actually read their program instead of listening to what they said on tv and besides the racism it's also asinine economically, and the right wing is in a pathetic state where they want power for the sake of power (the head of UMP a month or so ago, in the main political emission, when asked why people should vote for them when they failed to fix anything for the past 3 presidency, literally said ""far right is dangerous, left is dangerous, you should vote for us again"" without any more argumentation than that).

I sincerely hope for a fracture of the unified right wing and a re-appearance of the old right.

How about some facts.

One in Four Australians are born overseas, about 160.000 people a year migrate to Australia for a Country of 22 million, 0.7% pa.

The United States has just over 1 in 10 born outside of the US, with about 1.000.000 a year migrating to the US, out of a country of 314million, thats 0.3% pa.

The UK has 1 in 10 born outside of the UK with about 500.000 people a year migrating to the Uk, out of a country of 63million, 0.8% pa.

So Australia has a far greater foreign born population with a similar contemporary immigration percentage while the United states has a similar foreign born population but less than half the current immigration per capita.

Must say that, after they are again repeating the ""coterie"" tactics, I doubt they will offer any kind of debate beforehand. It would be the role of the politicians, our representatives, to drag the participants into the spotlight. 

This would increase transparency, awareness and maybe even understanding for some obviously market driven demands on the noble issue of protecting property.

I don't know if they contributed to building it but I'll ask my grandma the next time I see her. I know that they had some properties there, but nothing major. After WW1 a lot of the Baltic German property was given to the Balts. Even though they were still aristocratic in name, my family was pretty much living like regular (well off) citizens by the time WW2 started. 

My great grandmother was the last person in my close family who actually spoke Estonian and Latvian and she passed away a few years ago. My grandparents were children when they emigrated, and even though we sometimes travel to the Baltic states and my grandmother still feels a strong connection to the country, she would never claim any property, even if she could.


We actually had a conversation about something like that once. And she thinks it's ridiculous that some of our more distant relatives try to pursue debts that were owed to their ancestors.  

But like I said, she still identifies as a Baltic German. She regularly meets up with other Baltic Germans, she regularly travels to Riga, where she spent the first years of her life, and she pays for the upkeep of some family graves in Latvia. 

We're actually planning to travel to Riga with the entire family next year. This summer I travelled to Tallinn by myself. The Baltics are a pretty interesting region and it's nice to have a connection to it.

Well, I do. As do many people. You don't care about gay marriage or adoption? Then I'm willing to bet you're not affected by them.

&gt; By the way I'm against marriage for both heterosexuals and homosexuals. State has nothing to do with our feelings. I'm not going to defend a point of view I don't agree with.

Ok, but since heterosexual marriage is legal, and I'm not seeing a big movement for dismantling it, it's an apathetic view that only hurts gays. Apply this same argument to interracial marriage.

&gt; So I was explaining how there is no debate. How studies or rational points are never raised because it's either ""you're in favour of gay marriage and adoption"" or ""you're homophobic"". And I insist this is a false dilemma.

And I insist it isn't. If you're out there campaigning exclusively against gay marriage, and you lack secular reasons for doing so, then I'm reasonably certain homophobia is involved.

Now, if you're campaigning against all marriage, wonderful, but those aren't the signs I've seen.

EDIT: You can certainly argue that calling homophobes homophobic doesn't help the debate, and I'd agree. If I were having a debate with someone against gay marriage because Bible and ick, I wouldn't call him homophobic to his face.

On veut juste qu'elle s'exprime au travers d'autres formes que les caisses de secu monopolisees par l'etat. Heureusement, le concept de solidarite existait bien avant l'invention de l'etat, et continuera d'exister apres. Societes de secours mutuels par exemple.

&gt; C'est ""ah non mais je paye des taxes pour que l'autre fénéant de branleur de chômeur touche ses ARE quoi, c'est pas normal il a qu'a bosser comme tout le monde lol""

Encore une fois, le liberalisme n'interdit a personne de mettre en place des systemes d'assurance chomage divers et varies...

It will eventually have total control, or it will fail because of dissolution or revolution, in which case you will be back to the first end state- no government. So the two possible end states are: no central government or central government with total control.

But this is all dependent on that basic belief- that governments always want to grow. Is it possible for a government to remain within the confines it was originally created? That hasnt happened yet in human history but maybe it is a possibility?

I'm one of the undecided leaning out, get that out of the way.

I can see how a European federation could be a great thing, it's not difficult to imagine. There are literally hundreds of incredible things we could achieve. But I don't see the EU headed even remotely toward any of these and I think many of it's supporters are blinded by it's potential.

Biggest problem lack of democracy I won't even entertain the idea nor participate as of now I do not accept Brussels as legitimately government over me. The people of the UK never agreed to this my parents signed up for free trade. This also applies to the ECHR which while a different institution is born of the same thinking and has the same fundamental flaw.

Another problem is powers getting drawn into an opaque bureaucracy and never the reverse, so I guess it's my second condition subsidiarity needs to be more than words. If the EU insists on games hand something all the way down to the lowest level, the point is to set a precedent and establish a mechanism to draw power down and not have it be one way.

Last fundamental problem for me is the accounts, ie the staggering corruption so bad the auditors wont sign off for is it 12 years now this is not okay at all why are people not in prison over this for me to vote yes i want to see one year where it all checks out or at least an order of magnitude improvement.

The CAP is another problem I know this is a policy thing more than a fundamental problem but can we at least have some focus is it food security or propping up French jobs? I get we need to maintain the ability to feed ourselves, but it also crushes developing economies, how about we.
-end export subsidies (seriously WTF)
-end cash crop subsidies, we can live without those it's poor use of limited funds probably should be left to member states if they care enough, it's absurd to ask us to subsidise wine for example.
- let meat be more globalised, we can live without in an emergency, gives developing countries a market and probably drops the price of meat in an era of rising food prices. It doesn't really effect our food security we can even redirect those subsidies to staples.

I guess in summary no more powers for Brussels until A) at least one substantial thing is devolved back to member states B) they show massive improvements in something they do hold, I'd personally go for CFP it's low hanging fruit. A Med/agean coastguard with a joined up solution to the boat people would be particularly impressive. C) they get a set of accounts signed off.

If it moves toward these things I'll vote in but if as now it keeps moving away I'll probably vote out ideally kick back toward EEA and prep for a full exit see if it's possible to leave any bridge unburnt.

Where's the rallies? It's not a significant movement; not one that decides election anyway.

&gt; By fighting for gay marriage, you're in fact fight fighting for the extension of undeserved privileges and the right for the state to interfere in the love of two people.

By having straight marriages and adoptions be legal, the state already interferes. There is no significant movement to eliminate marriage. Holding out for that disadvantages gay couples for the rest of eternity.

It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The objectives of such a plan would be the disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide)",0,1384378857,null,0,false,0,cddniyw,t3_1qjeqk,t1_cddniyw,t1_cddneuw,null,1428671621,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

But isn't that what any vote is? Voting to what suits your political agenda? Also I would love to see the stats where it says hundreds off thousands of EU migrants are in the UK. Tens of thousands, probably. Hundreds? Doubtful. 

I like the /u/ajaume 's suggestion if if you want to switch your vote to your residence country, but you lose your vote in your home country. Of course to prevent constant switching this would have to be fair a fixed term (unless you are changing residency). Eg a pole couldn't switch to uk, the back to Poland, then back to uk etc.

""Significant"", as in, affects policy.

&gt; Marriage is a discrimination. Allowing gays to get married does not remove the fact that marriage is discrimination against unmarried couples, in fact, it does justify this discrimination.

You must realize that your strategy leaves gay couples at a disadvantage on the short, medium and long-term. The theory behind your tactics here is largely irrelevant; in practice, it merely means straight people can marry and gay people can't.

&gt; While I agree that there is some democratic deficit, the trend has been positive so far, , and the subsequent push by the EP to assert iself more and more.

Having dictators in Italy and Greece is not a good symptom for democracy. Let's remind that Mario Monti, who was praised as the man of the hour and the solution to the Italians' problems gathered only 10% of votes this year  when he ran for Prime Minister after saying he would not do so. People did not agree with his policies at all, and they still were under his rule without choosing him.

I've said before Lisbon is not legitimate, but I see it again as an argument. It's like 2008 all over again. People say no, they have it anyway.

&gt; and the subsequent push by the EP to assert iself more and more.

This won't solve the issue since it's already not democratic:

In July 2011, the European Parliament had to vote on a proposition coming from the European Commission, regarding the use of animal protein to feed fishes with.

However, what you have to know is that, at the European level, 72% of MEPs voted in favor, in particular from Germany, the Netherlands, Czech Republic and a majority of Eastern European states.


If France was not part of the EU, there would be no meat and bone meals at all, since French representatives would have voted against it at the French Parliament.

You are correct, point taken. My TRIPS example may be misleading when it comes to the role of the WTO with TPP. 

As for ways on how to enforce a signing of TPP, the surely critical [EFF](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp) points out:
&gt; Countries that are not parties to the negotiation will likely be asked to accede to the TPP as a condition of bilateral trade agreements with the US and other TPP members, or evaluated against the TPP's copyright enforcement standards in the annual Special 301 process administered by the US Trade Rep.

Really, in an ideal world, the media in most countries (especially English-speaking ones) should devote a lot more of their political coverage to things that happen in Brussels and across Europe. Typically it's only when someone says something inflammatory, or some controversial directive is passed, that the media go into anti-EU overdrive.

Moving beyond that, though, I'd like to see two things happen: a) the European Union needs to be reformed, a lot of processes streamlined (sorry France, but constantly travelling to Stratsbourg is an unnecessary expenditure). Europarties should be given more prominence in pan-EU elections, the President should be directly elected by popular vote, and a host of other reforms. As for point b) I think a lot more needs to be done to foster a sense of European identity. As a foreigner living in several corners around the EU, most European countries (the UK included) have far more similarities than they do differences, even if people don't recognise them. I'd like to see greater numbers sign up for ERASMUS, and generally larger cultural exchanges.

That's not a labour cost level being in reach for Germany. Which is a good thing by the way. Now, looking at the competitive factors should include looking at the productivity too and also not leaving out product quality. Since the very low cost products don't form the [main goods Germany exports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Germany), the last two factors gain some weight over the sheer cost of workforce.

By this, you would compare the gross domestic product (GDP) and the relation to the labour costs to receive a better impression. Now, the more your products head for the ""only we can produce *that* at *this* quality level"" category, the more headroom you gain. Which could lead to the assumption that trying to create low skilled and super cheap hordes of employees can't be the main interest of a country like Germany.

More generally, it would make sense for developed countries to raise the wages and improve the working conditions *globally*. You avoid being forced to lower your own standards since the globalised world with its low transportation costs isn't able to just switch to the next cheap labour supplier in the chain.

She is completely underserving of her media exposure, but the media give her coverage because her role is to have people associate the idea, amongst the French at least, that leaving the EU is a thing the far-right would do (since they're very critical of the EU), and this has been going on for 30 years.

But now, with the new and improved EU flair I can just sail along on the upboats.

Persecution complex much? Watch out we'll soon be banging on your door ;)

I know downvoting based on opinions happens way too much. But they'r imaginary internet points. You really shouldn't care. But you seem to care enough to go by the flag you seem to hate. If you don't then you'r seriously misrepresenting your views. Of course you can use it but from your point of view I just don't see why you would and it made me curious.

Anyway. Regarding said viewpoint.

Please tell me more how the UK's government is a beacon of democracy when compared.

It is indeed too late for these types of discussions but considering I will have little time to spend tomorrow morning I'll be damn lazy and resort to a copypasta written by someone else to start it off. Now I myself admit this one has quite a few holes in it (exaggeration, distance to the base electorate and whatnot not being considered and whatnot) but I'll leave it to you to rant on about those. 

Note that you'll have to drag it so far down the drain that it justifies the direct comparison with facist regimes (as you did) without exposing your own national government to somewhat similar comparisons. 

&gt;Legislation has to be passed by the European Parliament, where elected Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), such as Nigel Farage, sit. These are democratically chosen by the UK electorate, in a Proportional Representation (PR) process, so therefore more democratic than the way that Members of Parliament (MPs) are elected to the UK Parliament. The European Parliament “may approve or reject a legislative proposal, or propose amendments to it.”

&gt;The argument against this process being democratic was that the European Commission alone creates the legislation, not the European Parliament, and that the Commission is ‘unelected’.

&gt;There is a Commissioner for each of the 27 member countries, elected by its own national government (which in turn is elected by its own electorate), so this is still democratic with respect to each national electorate. The Commission (the cabinet) and the President together comprise the executive of the EU. The European Parliament then has to elect the President and the Commission, so the nationally-elected MEPs vote on whether to accept the President and Commission: still democratic so far.

&gt;So the argument that the EU is ‘less representative’ can be seen to be specious: every step of the way in creating EU legislation involves a decision by the MEPs, who are elected nationally by a ‘fairer’ democratic process than our First-Past-The-Post (FPTP). Yes, the Executive aren’t directly elected, but so what? Let’s compare that to the UK system, shall we?

&gt;We will ignore the anachronism that is the monarchy, for the Queen is generally regarded as only a figurehead, although constitutionally she is the final arbiter and the government acts in her name.

&gt;Within the UK we have two bodies involved in proposing and enacting legislation. The ‘lower’ house is the House of Commons: the ‘upper’ house is the House of Lords.

&gt;For the House of Commons in the UK we elect MPs via a FPTP electoral system, which is widely regarded as ‘unfairer’ than the Proportional Representation system that European Parliament elections utilise. The leader of the party that wins the most seats (usually, in a simple majority situation) becomes the Prime Minister (PM). Note that constitutionally they don’t even need to be an MP, though it’s a long time since this last happened (Lord Palmerston was Prime Minister twice between 1855 and 1865 for over 9 years).

&gt;Although the winning party leader may be elected as an MP, he is not elected directly as PM by anyone other than his own party, often years previously. So already the European Parliamentary system is more democratic.

&gt;This unelected head of government then chooses his own cabinet, which along with the PM forms the executive: this is analogous to the European Commission. They alone decide the legislation that the government introduces in each session of parliament (yes, I know there is a very limited mechanism for lone MPs to introduce their own legislation, but this is often thwarted in each parliament without the majority government support).

&gt;The elected MPs within the House of Commons then vote on this legislation proposed by the executive. If they vote for it to become law then it moves on to the unelected House Of Lords (the Lords are a collection of hereditary peers, politicians chosen by their party colleagues and Bishops – none directly chosen by the electorate). Both houses can choose to amend the legislation, although amendments can be rejected at subsequent stages.

&gt;Once both houses have ‘read’ the proposed bill three times it passes to the Queen for Royal Assent and then the government chooses when to enact it.

&gt;As can be seen very little of this legislative process is fully ‘democratic’ by any definition, and every single step has an analogous step in the EU legislative process. Comparison shows that the EU legislative process and its actors are, at every stage, at least as democrative and frequently more democratic than the UK process.",0,1384388580,null,0,1384389408,0,cddrtys,t3_1qjeqk,t1_cddrtys,t1_cddqoue,null,1428669612,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt; Last fundamental problem for me is the accounts, ie the staggering corruption so bad the auditors wont sign off for is it 12 years now this is not okay at all why are people not in prison over this for me to vote yes i want to see one year where it all checks out or at least an order of magnitude improvement.

The reason nobody is in prison over it is because it's not actually ""massive corruption"" and unsigned-off accounts. The actual accounts *are* signed off, because they're basically OK. What the EU accounts get is a 'qualified' sign-off due to unacceptable levels of material errors (&gt;3%) in, usually, CAP and cohesion spending, but those ""material errors"" include things like late payments, payments in error, and sloppily filled out forms - the actual level of fraud is pretty low, and mostly recovered by OLAF.

Having said that, most (like 90%+) of the day to day handing out of EU funding is actually done by the member states, and some member states are, well, 'cleaner' than others. That's where most of the errors actually arise, but member states aren't particularly inclined to prosecute their own civil servants for being a little careless with EU money.

On topic, then, part of the breeding ground for euroscepticism is popular myths like ""the EU hasn't had its accounts signed off for 12 years!!!"". They're not an accurate basis on which to decide whether the EU is worthwhile, and they are extremely persistent in eurosceptic media and beliefs. They're attractive because they're pithy and contain a grain of truth, while the real situation is complex - hence the long explanation!",0,1384393524,null,0,1384393709,0,cddtx0a,t3_1qjeqk,t1_cddtx0a,t1_cddmi2m,null,1428668640,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Sure, things are fine there right now, but they are facing an exponential population collapse, and a ridiculously inverted population period.  That video covers their lack of openness to immigration.

As for your flair, I did not see it on my mobile app, and did not assume you were Irish from your username, as that has backfired on me in the past.  However, as Ireland is part of the EU, and as you pointed out, we are in /r/europe, you flair does not save you from this issue.  

&gt;Multiculturalism has been an abject failure here.

Absofuckinglutley!!  And this is my issue, and you have explained exactly why.  You Europeans have let unassimilated immigrants run amok.  Your police are petrified of them.  Pathetic.  All these no go areas where sharia law was more or less in effect, female genital mutilation being performed and even honor killings.  How could you let this insanity go on?  You guys let this fester to the point of no return.  I always hear of 3rd generation ""citizens"" from Algeria in France, or Turkey in Germany who can not speak French of German!  I honestly can't comprehend how that is even possible.  

You guys let these people set up a society within a society.  I have no interest in discussing how immigrants can assimilate much easier in countries like Canada/US, etc. that are built on immigration.  I am interested in discussing how so many European countries looked the other way while all manner of barbarity took place within their own borders.  Why is there no will to uphold basic tenets of Western civilization, in addition to your own laws?

So please don't confuse me with some bleeding heart ""you rayciss"" guy.

But here is the tricky part, population growth.  The birth rate for all developed societies has plummeted.  Japan, South Korea, Spain, Italy, etc. basically have negative rates (as do white Americans).  The way economies currently function, you at least need to maintain or have only a small population decrease before deflation hits.  Until this is sorted out immigration is needed.  I know that we are very, very lucky to border countries that share basic values with us.  So while there may be Mexican drug gangs, etc., there are not beheadings.

Or is the tax only if i install a grid-interactive inverter (ie. i'm using the grid to ""back up"" my solar power).

There's a real issue that if everyone did that, there'd be no revenue for the grid to pay for generating power at off-solar-peak times.  I can see there being a legitimate issue there.

However a) i'm really surprised any large grid has gotten to the point where that's significant from *home* solar installation (utility scale is something different, but utility scale solar is just like a conventional power plant in how it interacts with the grid).

and b) it doesnt appear from any description I've seen, that Spain's law is limited to grid-interactive cases. (but then again, i've never read it in Spanish).

Madrid has, being a big city and the capital, a music scene; but I don't think is very good.

I believe Barcelona is a more artsy place than Madrid, it's always been culturally more advanced. Madrid is in the middle of the country and it's a more old-school type of place, more traditional.

Mario has been a consistent character and people have a specific image of him, often one of fondness and nostalgia. *The longer he is around and his character is consistent; the more potent this nostalgia becomes.* This is a big part of Mario's appeal. If there was no copyright restricting rights to Nintendo; then anyone could create *and sell for profit* stories, games, comics etc with ""Mario"" The character would denigrate, fracture as everyone has their own variation. Some would be good, some would be annoying and even worse, some other giant company, say Sony, could pour millions/billions into making a ""Mario"" game with cutting-edge graphics; something that Nintendo is simply not big enough to produce.

It depends on who you apply for work with, but normally only government and public service (including academia) jobs have strict requirements (and even then it's not a given that they wouldn't accept a foreign degree, their requirements are defined in terms of what kind of unversity you need to have studied at and for how long, not in terms of specific degrees). I would expect that most businesses would accept any ""master's degree"" as equivalent to German ones, or rather, that they wouldn't care about the differences as much as they'd care about your actual skills and experience.

For language certification, start [here](http://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/enindex.htm) (Goethe-Institut). Again, businesses typically only have set requirements when the position you're applying for requires spoken or written German for some reason, e.g. if it's customer-facing. Good spoken and written German is a skill that will usually be listed among other requirements in a job ad if it's important. If it's not, there's a good chance that being able to apply for a job in German and do the interview(s) in German will be good enough without further proof. Keep in mind that the German labour market is open to most EU citizens, so your case is not as rare as you might think. 

Once you are in Germany, affordable ""Deutsch als Fremdsprache"" (""German as a foreign language"") courses are available at pretty much any VHS (Volkshochschule) and those will typically be aligned with Goethe-Institut certifications.

I would recommend to stay away from a car unless you're going to visit rural areas. (Also, I wonder if rental places have cars with automatic transmission, although I guess they have some). 

Train is super fast, but usually much more expensive unless you're a foreigner and can use the train pass. Which you can!

Here's the website: 
http://www.raileurope.com/rail-tickets-passes/eurail-spain-pass/index.html

The number of days refers to the number of days you'll actually be travelling. If you're staying 1 month and travelling 2 times, select ""2 days"". Select a second passenger as well and you'll get the total price for both of you. 

(This is valid for high speed and medium to large distances trains). 

A normal roundtrip from Madrid to Barcelona would cost you 90-100€ per person. So please plan your route beforehand and check how much you're actually saving with this pass. Visit www.renfe.es for schedules and prices. 

For a cheaper transportation method you could use the bus, which is slower than car and the train but much less expensive.

true,krisfratoyen,null,null,"I'm Norwegian, but I have lived for an extended period of time in Both Barcelona (1 year) and Madrid (2 years). Both are great cities, but with different qualities. 

Barcelona: Perhaps one of the greatest cities in the world to visit. The whole city is basically a work of art, from the buildings to the people, the nature and culture. I guess colorful is a good way to describe it. However, the novelty wears off after a while if you live there, and you then have to deal with living in a city where everyone's a tourist or foreigner thinking they found nirvana. You might not mind, but that got on my nerves a lot. I still visit every year and think ""why did Í ever leave?"", but after a week or so I usually remember. Barcelona is also the main city in Cataluña, and while everyone is able to speak Spanish, you will always feel like you don't truly belong there if you don't speak Catalan to some extent (at least I did).

Madrid: This is a huge metropolitan city which is more comparable with Paris and London than anything else. Madrid really feels like the heart of the Spanish speaking world (apologies in advance to any South Americans). It's a huge city with lots of people, and everyone seems to be in more of a hurry there than Barcelona and other places in Spain. Culture-wise you have everything; World class museums, great food from everywhere in the world, a spectacular concert scene, sports, etc etc... The public transportation is among the best in the world, so moving about is inexpensive and fairly easy, despite pretty large distances. Nature-wise, Madrid doesn't really have much to offer. It's 3 hours from the closest beach, which sucks in summer. It also gets pretty cold in winter. There are mountains and nice hiking country close by, but it was just not part of everyday life when I was living there (even though I'm very outdoors'y).

Other cities in spain are great as well, but most, if not all of them (with the possible exception of Valencia) are too small to live in, in my view.

I am partial to Madrid, but I can't really explain why. It feels a bit more undiscovered to the outside world, and it has more to offer if you know where to look. Both cities are great, and you won't regret moving to either, but I guess it comes down to personal preference at the end of the day. I would spend a week or so in both cities before deciding where to settle. You'll probably fall more in love with Barcelona than Madrid, but remember, it won't be holiday every day if you live there.

This area has basically got both mountains + sea. The only drawback I can think of is that it's not as Spanishy as other areas.

French is a net payer for the CAP if I'm not mistaken, and export subsidies are all but gone as we speak.

The first mistrust happened millennia ago when it turned out that these guys to the west, unlike our eastern and southern nieghbours, are totally mute [niemy (mute in Polish) -&gt; Niemcy (Germans in Polish).]

Till now we keep wondering how is it possible that Johann Goethe came from the country that later produced (and used) Panzerkampfwagen Koenigstiger.

To keep it short - very smart, technically skilled people, with strange language, longing for perfectly organised society (Slavic soul cannot take it) and very peculiar love for Schadenfreude...

true,wiredjazz,null,null,"Apologies for writing in English, but as an ex-pat I feel my Italian isn't good enough to be clear on such a complicated issue.

Obviously this is a complex issue, and as an ex-pat you may feel I don't deserve to comment, but as an Australian who has been here for just over a year now, I can tell you how I see it.

1) Tax
Here's the truth: People don't pay taxes because the documentation is too hard and the taxes are too high. They also know they can avoid it, safely.
There should be tax reform to simplify the process (in Australia it's a booklet, of maybe 10 pages. Most people need to fill out only 3 or 4 of those pages).
Taxes need to be lowered to try to boost the economy. If people have more expendable income, they travel more, they purchase more and they put more money into the economy. This improves general morale but it also means that Italian companies (that are based here) will profit more, and pay more tax as a result. Feasibly, average income may also rise.
In Australia, the government gave a large proportion of the population $900 and it is said that this rebate pulled us through the GFC.

2) Culture.
Italy prides itself on its history and its culture, while simultaneously lamenting the fact that it is a newly unified nation. The problem is that all of the art and history that Italy has is now in the hands of Tourism or the vatican. Italy is overrun by tourists most times of the year, and many Italians claim that this is evidence of their strong culture. But where are the artists of today? In small workshops in florence, selling their wares at a market. There doesn't appear, to me, to be a lot of money being directed toward charity, onlus, or cultural development. Italian television, aside from RAI, is mostly cheaply made gameshow television or overdubbed foreign products.

In Australia, about 50 years ago, we introduced a law which said 40% of television needed to be local. It actually meant that we started making cheap, low quality television to fill that 40% quota. Not a good solution, and the television networks are cheating the system in this way, but a better solution than importing everything. Italian film, on the other hand, is wonderful. There's some amazing comedy out there, as well as drama and documentary being made. Culturally, I would be putting more money in the hands of those who are pushing really hard. Like him or hate him, Jovanotti has some potential overseas. I'd put some grants in place to allow Italian artists to tour the world. I'd commission documentaries on food across Italy, music across Italy. I'd take small teams into the Valtiberina to make a documentary on La Verna, contrasting history with modern day Italy, and tying in Papa Francesco.

3) English.
I would introduce a subsidised system to teach people over 40 (those who studied French at school) conversational English. I wrote an article stating the opposite here (http://www.samuelwebster.com/portfolio/2013/05/italians-speak-english/) but it had different academic goals (the preservation of Italian cultural versus American introduction of products).

I would introduce a grant program for public schools that meant ex-pats or Italian fluent English speakers could be available as Teacher's aides during the final years of high school. I've seen some amazing English speakers come out of the current high school system, and the English literature studied is of a very high standard, but I've also heard stories of teachers who judge pronunciation instead of clarity, or clarity instead of pronunciation. These are things which can be remedied with conversation classes.

4) the Roma gypsies.

I don't want to get to deep into this, because it's HUGELY complex, but their culture is a self-perpetuating system. Because they are marginalised, they adopt a social structure which sees them begging, and living 'off the grid'/'out of the system'. We can't create a welfare system that can be exploited, because that will also perpetuate the issue, but we need to ensure that these children are in schools. I would propose a system whereby families receive a small amount of welfare, distributed to service providers who would provide an apartment, food deliveries and education. Welfare would be cut if the children didn't attend school, or if any family member was caught in criminal activity. The welfare would need to be high enough to ensure criminal activity wasn't necessary to survive. Adults not fit for work would be given clothes for job interviews, and free courses in communication and basic skills. Welfare would be based on them going to these workshops, and would cease if, after these workshops were finished, they refused to apply for jobs. This needs to be a system that people are not forced into, but that is more appealing, for the good of future generations, than the current social structure which perpetuates a very difficult life, but one which ultimately still sustains them.

5) 'Return to Italy' trips.

The system which Israel has, where any jewish child gets a free flight to Israel when they turn 18, is a good one for perpetuating cultural awareness. I think it would be beneficial for the Italian culture if all of the second-generation Italians worldwide were able to come back to the region in which their parents or grandparents were born, and experience the life and culture of the ancestry. Sure, some of them are going to return as they came, but others will perpetuate the traditions of Italy. The food, family and community which makes Italy such an amazing place to live.

6) Conclusion

The big problem is... This all costs money and Italy is not a country with oil or precious minerals. For that, I think there needs to be an increase in corporate tax, followed soon after by a decrease in individual tax. But I'm not an economist. I'm just a left wing ex-pat with some ideas.

true,zakk,veneto,,"&gt; Un conto sono le funzioni di Banca dello Stato come intendi tu (emettere valuta, eccetera).

Non sono quelle che intendo io, è la definizione universalmente accettata di Banca di Stato o Banca centrale che dir si voglia. Te lo dico con molta simpatia, e senza nessuna polemica, ma sei tu che stai sbagliando la terminologia.

In ogni caso, vuoi ora mi sembra di capire che vuoi unire due cose: banche, Banca di Stato. E il tutto andrebbe nazionalizzato. Capisco giusto?

Allora per quanto riguarda nazionalizzare l'ente che gestisce la politica monetaria, a inizio '800 qualcuno si è reso conto che dev'essere un ente indipendente, e così è sempre stato negli ultimi due secoli. Ad esempio Wiki spiega che:

&gt; Nel XVIII secolo, quando Banche Centrali e numerosi istituti di credito erano proprietà degli Stati, questi utilizzavano il potere di erogare credito e battere moneta per finanziare la propria spesa pubblica e spese militari.
Chi controllava gli istituti, poteva procurarsi crediti a condizioni favorevoli o di importo pressoché illimitato, senza fornire garanzie e ripagare quanto ottenuto.

In a nutshell: lo Stato spende i soldi, la Banca centrale li emette. Se questi due soggetti non sono indipendenti, capitano casini. Soprattutto in uno Stato con una spesa pubblica folle come l'Italia.

Per quanto riguarda unire la Banca di Stato e le singole banche, anche in questo caso si generano storture difficilmente superabili. Un esempio, tra i milioni di conflitti che si genererebbero: un mutuo a tasso variabile è attaccato al tasso di inflazione. Se la MegaBancaCentralePiùTutteLeBanchePrivate accende un mutuo ad un cittadino, allo stesso tempo ha il potere di emettere moneta, da cui deriva un buon controllo del tasso di interesse.

Se tu vuoi un mutuo dove il tasso di interesse è controllato da chi lo emette... Io dico no, grazie.

A quanto ho capito, stai dicendo che l'esame di stato serve a evitare che una specie di idiot savant capace di passare gli esami di ingegneria ma inetto nel resto delle attività intellettuali possa accedere all'albo.

Posto che sia così, non capisco il motivo per cui si voglia porre questo filtro. Se lo scopo dell'albo è garantire degli standard qualitativi ai progetti firmati dagli ingegneri, allora quell'idiot savant sarebbe perfetto.

Se io devo mettere un pacemaker mi va benissimo sapere che quello che l'ha progettato è una specie di nerdone maniaco di elettronica che non sa come organizzare un campo della protezione civile.

Provo a spiegare la mia visione della cosa con un'analogia. Poniamo che esista un ordine degli scalatori, e lo stato preveda che solo chi è in questo ordine possa accompagnare la gente ai rifugi. Io sono uno scalatore, ho appena scalato una montagna e ci ho messo 5 giorni, durante i quali ho affrontato ghiacciai, ghiaioni, ferrate e sentieri. Arrivato alla cima posso affrontare l'esame di stato, che consiste in un test di qualche sport. Potrebbe essere una corsa ma anche una partita a scacchi. A ogni sessione d'esame il test ginnico è diverso, così come per ogni montagna.

Restando nell'analogia, io sto dicendo che se lo scopo dell'esame è garantire la sicurezza della gente che va con degli scalatori in montagna e tu dici che il fatto di essere arrivati al test da solo non conta perché una montagna potrebbe essere stata molto più facile di un'altra.

Se è così concordo, ma dico che allora la soluzione è valutare la difficoltà delle montagne per escludere quelle troppo facili o utilizzare come test la scalata di una montagna nota, mentre fare fare un test slegato da quello che poi dovrai fare e valutato con criteri non noti non ha senso, e infatti negli altri paesi non esiste nulla di tutto ciò (a parte l'Inghilterra, mi pare, ma non so come sia organizzato lì).",0,1384426956,null,0,false,0,cde3g3l,t3_1qj5wq,t1_cde3g3l,t1_cde2bpi,null,1428664144,0,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,0

Yet the purpose of criminalizing something is not to 100% prevent the activity from happening. The purpose is to give legal basis to prosecute for such activity, and to give legal protection for the victim who will then have the ability to report a crime and/or file charges. 

For example: Criminalizing sexual assault does not prevent such acts from happening. They do happen and often out of sight. But only if the act is defined as a crime can the victim report a crime and the assaulter be arrested, prosecuted and sentenced.

Preventing crimes is another thing, and is more related to law enforcement. And also law enforcement needs a legal basis for preventing activity - for example a law that defines it as a felony or crime. If something is not a crime then law enforcement has very little basis for preventing it.

Saying that criminalizing wanton infant circumcision without medical justification does not prevent it from happening is correct. It does not. That's because it is the nature of laws, laws themselves do not prevent crimes from happening. They define what is a crime and what are the repercussions for committing such acts.

When the act of infant circumcision without medical justification is criminalized then the persons commiting such act can be prosecuted. Law enforcement and justice system can take action upon it.

As you can see, the amount of the basic income is specified by only two qualitative expressions. The much quoted 2'500/month is just a suggestion by the initiators.

**""If you give everyone x-CHF more money, cost of living will go up by x-CHF (inflation).""**

The idea is not that everyone gets additional money. The idea is that a minimum level of income that everybody requires to live should be unconditional. If you earn more than the basic income, you will keep earning the same (e.g. if you make 8k/month now you will get a (8k - basic income) wage + basic income). Obviously, wages that are only a little above the basic income will have to be increased, which will have an effect on prices.

**Financing**

This is the short version (that I've seen on the news) of what the initiators propose. I don't know what assumptions were used.

Expected costs with 2'500/month basic income: 200bn/year.

110bn: as mentioned above, a lot of what will be paid out as basic income is already part of the wages.

60bn: already part of existing social welfare payments (much but not all welfare would be cut).

30bn: factual costs of the basic income which could be financed by increasing VAT from 8% to 20%.

Con i passi da gigante che ha fatto l'informatica era impensabile che l'uomo potesse tenere il ritmo dei computer. Ho letto recentemente un articolo che sosteneva che l'apertura Gambetto di Re è stata *risolta*, cioè un (cluster) di computer ha calcolato tutte le possibili varianti ed ha determinato l'esito delle partite. È inevitabile, dipende solo dal tempo che ci vuole a sviluppare hardware sempre più potenti.

* no, una semplice arrotolabile; in /r/chess invece ci sono post e post di collezionisti con i set di pezzi e le scacchiere più disparate. Io però giocherei sempre con un banalissimo set di legno con pezzi comuni, la forma diversa potrebbe confondermi.

* il fatto che siano un gioco dove la fortuna conta molto, molto poco. Può accadere un colpo di fortuna, ma se continui a commettere lo stesso errore perderai molto più spesso di quanto vincerai.

* Il vantaggio del bianco c'è ma non è determinante. Considera che in una qualunque delle mie partite ci sono almeno un paio di errori sia dalla mia che da parte dell'avversario. Il vantaggio dev'essere custodito fino alla fine per rendere qualcosa. Mi permetto, anche se non richiesto, di aprire una piccola parentesi sugli errori.
Io credo che, semplificando, gli errori si possano classificare in 3 tipi:

* l'imprecisione
* l'errore
* la cappella

In termini informatici, l'imprecisione ti costa al massimo 20-30 [centipawn](http://chess.wikia.com/wiki/Centipawn) quando un pedone è uguale a 100 centipawn. L'errore ti costa fino a 60 centipawn mentre la cappella è dai 60 in su. Quando perdi un pedone o un pezzo senza un ritorno in termini di controgioco o iniziativa (virtualmente anch'essi valutati in centipawn) è già una cappella. Più è alto il valore del pezzo, peggiore è la cappella.
Premesso ciò, nelle mie partite solitamente ci sono 2-3 imprecisioni, e quando va bene 1 errore. Puoi commettere un errore anche se sei molto in vantaggio, e in questo caso comunque vincere perché l'errore non ti è costato tutto il vantaggio. Un amatore tipicamente commette un paio di cappelle a partite, 3-4 errori e una decina di imprecisioni.
A livello top, un'imprecisione ti costa la partita.

I had to come first here, and she had to fill out her visa application in our country of origin, while I was already here, there is no way she can apply if you are not living already in Germany as far as I know.

Check the links here provided but from top of my mind of the most important things that we required were:

* I needed to be here already, with a lease or some kind of Bestätigung of where you would live, has the minimum vital space for all the family. Which I think is around 12m2 per adult and 8 or 10 per children. This I don't know you being a german citizen would change something.
* Marriage certificate with apostille and translation to german of both the certificate and the apostille
* She needs to take german classes, A1 certificate is required and has to be from an institution like Goethe Institut.
* Health insurance valid for the Schengen Area, it could even be a travel insurance but be sure to really check the validity.
* The visa process can take between 6 and 8 weeks.
* When her visa process start they will mail you to your living address in germany and ask you some more papers, mostly the marriage certificate, the lease contract and a written letter signed by you where you state that you want your family to come over and live with you in Germany.

All but the first one she must have, before even applying for the Visa, and as far as I know she has to apply for the Visa on the German Embassy of her country, but you should ask at the Embassy.

In the web site for german embassy for her country should be a lot of info about the process.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I know circumcision has been proven to reduce the rate of HIV transmission quite significantly.

The evidence for that has been far from convincing. While it is possible that such an effect may exist the related studies suffer from numerous problems with their methods such as counselling the circumcised group on safe sex practices, or giving them condoms but neglecting the uncircumcised control group. The studies also fail to differentiate between the many effects which are at play as sexuality and sexual habits are a very complex social phenomenom with a lot of cultural and also individual variation (such as differences between ethnic groups, differences in alcohol usage between groups etc).

The studies themselves have been made in African countries with severe HIV epidemics, and it's not clear how they would be relevant to for example Nordic countries where HIV rates are very low - despite also circumcision being rare (interestingly as a western country the US has both highest circumcision rate and also HIV rate, which is odd if it's supposed to prevent HIV).

Here's a very good criticism of those African studies: [Sub-Saharan African randomised clinical trials into male circumcision and HIV transmission: methodological, ethical and legal concerns](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22320006)

That's not the only paper criticizing those studies, their methods and results.

Hollande est le président de la faiblesse politique et dans la cacophonie gouvernementale actuelle, il n'a touché qu'à une trentenaire inconnue qui s'était trouvée là par hasard. 

Hollande n'a pas été élu sur un discours, il a été élu contre un épouvantail. On pouvait détester Sarkozy, on pouvait haïr son style, son mépris des fonctionnaires, des ""gueux"", mais il a mis en application ce pourquoi il avait été élu. Hollande a été élu sur un discours complètement mensonger ""mon ennemi, c'est la finance""; sur une ligne politique indéfinie ""On ira renégocier les traités"", ""Il n'y aura pas d'austérité""; sur 10000 propositions dont on s'aperçoit qu'elles ne sont même pas une feuille de route et encore moins un jalon de la politique gouvernementale; sur un clientélisme électoral dont les intérêts sont opposés à ceux des Français. 

Enfin sur 80% des ""mauvaises"" mesures de droite que tu cites, on peut clairement dire qu'elles ont catalysé une contestation factice ou qu'elles sont continuées par le gouvernement actuel. J'appelle pas vraiment ça des critiques des gouvernements précédents.

Maintenant on va avoir les contrats d'avenir dont on sait déjà qu'ils sont un mauvais relooking des emplois-jeunes de Jospin qui ont produit du chômage et n'ont pas qualifié les jeunes en les coinçant dans des emplois para-publics sans perspective de long terme.

true,vlepun,NETH,The Netherlands,"Alright I've looked it up. It's nice that CBS StatLine is a public source. Now there are a couple of things that are nice to know if you're not Dutch and also can't read our language. These are translations of the definitions the CBS uses for it's figures. In [this table](http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;PA=81947NED&amp;D1=0-1,12,18,22,25-28,39,45,49,52-53&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0-4&amp;D5=%28l-2%29-l&amp;HDR=G2,G1,G3,G4&amp;STB=T&amp;VW=T) I'm going from left to right (and unfortunately these figures are not available in English).

1. Geregistreerde verdachten: Registered suspects. This includes *only* those individuals that are or have been part of an official police investigation into criminal acts. Scientific research in The Netherlands relies on these figures as well as on anonymous self-report questionnaires, however, this second part of data is behind a pay wall as they're part of scientific publications. 

2. Totaal verdachten van misdrijven: Total number of subjects. There are a few things to keep in mind here. Again, this only accounts for those suspects that have been a part of official police investigations into criminal acts *and have been registered as such*. Keep in mind that someone who has been captured for multiple cases will only be registered *once per case*. So, someone who has been arrested for 10 burglaries and 2 violent criminal acts will be registered as follows:
1 time for total suspects, 1 time in white collar crimes (vermogensdelicten), 1 time in violent criminal acts (geweldsmisdrijven). 

3. Autochtoon means simply 'Persons of whom both parents were born in The Netherlands'. 

4. Allochtoon means 'Person of whom at least one parent was born in a foreign country'.

5. Westerse Allochtoon means the definition of 4, but limits the foreign countries to countries in Europe (except for Turkey), Northern America, Oceania or Indonesia or Japan. This is done on the basis of social-economical status. This group primarily includes people from former Dutch Indies and employees of Japanese companies and their families.

6. Niet-Westerse Allochtoon: as in 4, but the countries are: Any country in Africa, Latin-America and Asia (except for Indonesia and Japan) or Turkey. 

Now, since you've inquired as to the violent crimes you will want to take a look at the 'Verdachten van geweldsmisdrijven' row. As you can see the total number of suspects of this type of crime for 2012 is very closely together. It's about 50/50 almost.

It would have been interesting to look at the ratio of 'autochtoon', 'allochtoon' in the prison systems as well, but this data is not available on StatLine. 

Edit:

I thought it would also be interesting to see how this would hold for youth, which are registered in the HALT system. You can find those figures [by clicking here](http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;PA=71930NED&amp;D1=0-11&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0-3&amp;D5=5-7&amp;HDR=G1,G2,G3,G4&amp;STB=T&amp;VW=T). 

As you will notice there are far fewer allochtoon youths who have been in contact with the HALT system compared to autochtoon youth. (Definitions are the same.) This holds true when you filter on specific countries in which the parent(s) was born to Turkey and Morocco as well.

Three different things. 

&gt; But the newfound popularity of souvlaki...

It was never unpopular. Every neighbourhood has at least one souvlaki joint and they're rarely empty.

&gt; Avant-garde chefs have taken to spicing up age-old recipes. In place of traditional meats like pork and chicken, souvlaki with everything from shrimp to swordfish to bacon is now available.

I remember having shrimp souvlaki more than 10 years ago. Variations have been around for much longer than the author thinks.

&gt; What explains the souvlaki craze? Some say it is a newfound consumer patriotism

Again, ""craze""? In other news, the British have suddenly discovered fish and chips.

&gt; But not everyone is happy about the sudden proliferation of souvlaki stands. Retailers in Athens's upscale northern suburb of Kifissia sniff at the recent invasion of greasy spoon operations, saying they are tarnishing the luster of the neighborhood.

Bollocks. Souvlaki joints are fucking everywhere. You're just as likely to see a shipping tycoon in one of those as regular people. And Kifissia isn't Athens' poshiest suburb, more like upper middle class.

The reality is this: if she can't go to Germany for treatment, then there's no Agreement. Croats had to swallow war crimes trials when every single one of their war heroes *obviously* didn't do anything wrong to join the EU; Serbs had to do the same to become a candidate; and you have to let Tymoshenko get treatment in Germany to sign the Agreement. Oh, and protect gay people too.

Those conditions have been understood as such since forever, and you've been fooling yourselves you've been under the impression that the deal can be done without them. Whether you think it's fair or not isn't relevant. Serbs and Croats didn't find their deals fair either, but they lived up to them.

If you can't let Tymoshenko get treatment, then (sadly for both the EU and Ukraine) there's no Stabilization and Association Agreement.

It boils down to this. See this document?

In biologia esistono vari modelli di crescita. Dire che in un secolo siamo passati da 1 miliardo a 7 miliardi quindi tra 100 anni saremo 50 miliardi è come dire che a luglio c'erano 20 gradi, a dicembre zero, quindi tra sei mesi ce ne saranno -20.

Fare riferimento a quella che si chiama [crescita di Malthus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth) per la popolazione terrestre avrebbe senso solamente se le risorse fossero illimitate, cosa che, come indichi tu, certamente non è. In tale crescita, la popolazione cresce secondo un'iperbole. In tale modello, il tasso di crescita è direttamente proporzionale al numero di individui, oppure costante.

[Se in un sistema le risorse sono non illimitate, e questo vale anche per i batteri](http://www.historyfuturenow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/populationgrowthhistory2.jpg) la crescita tende a seguire una curva sigmoide (a S) che somiglia alla prima solamente nel primo tratto (di crescita) mentre tende alla cosiddetta capacità portante del sistema man mano che ci si avvicina. Se vai a vedere lo storico del tasso di crescita della popolazione umana vedrai che [non solo non è costante, ma è anche stabilmente in diminuzione](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_population_growth_rate_1950%E2%80%932050.svg), man mano che ci avviciniamo alla capacità portante della terra.

Motivo per cui, niente panico. Non avremmo tutti la bistecca, ma ci sarà cibo per quelli che saranno presenti. non avrai il petrolio, ma magari energia pulita a basso costo (torio, solare, sfere dyson ecc). Se nel mio acquario la luce solare basta per dar da mangiare alle bestiole che ci abitano, senza apporti esterni, non vedo perchè non possa funzionare per la terra.

Catastrofi e rivoluzioni? Ci sono già state, meh. Una volta non c'era ossigeno nell'atmosfera, poi le alghe ne hanno fatto talmente tanto che ora è il 21%, e ha ammazzato buona parte degli organismi dell'epoca con la sua tossicità. Risultato? Apri la finestra. :) Non rischiamo niente di simile per molto molto tempo (*).

[Joint statement from the Nordic Ombudsmen for Children and pediatric experts - Let the boys decide on circumcision](http://www.crin.org/docs/English-statement-.pdf)

&gt; Circumcision, performed without a medical indication, on a person who is incapable of giving consent, violates fundamental medical-ethical principles, not least because the procedure is irreversible, painful and may cause serious complications. There are no health-related reasons for circumcising young boys in the Nordic countries.  Circumstances that may make circumcision advantageous for adult men are of little relevance to young boys in the Nordic countries, and on these matters the boys will have the opportunity to decide for themselves when they reach the age and maturity required to give consent.    
   
&gt; As Ombudsmen for Children and pediatric experts we are of the opinion that circumcision without medical indication is in conflict with Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which addresses the child’s right to express his/her own views in all matters concerning him/her, and Article 24, point 3, which states that children must be protected against traditional practices that may be prejudicial to their health.  
In 2013, The UN Human Rights Council also encouraged all countries to ban harmful practices that compromise the integrity and dignity of the child and are prejudicial to the health of boys and girls.  
...  
The Nordic Ombudsmen for Children in conjunction with pediatric experts therefore wish to work towards a situation where circumcision without medical indication may only be carried out if a boy, who has reached the age and maturity required in order to understand the necessary medical information, chooses to consent to the procedure.  
...  
We request our governments to take necessary measures to ensure that boys are given the opportunity to decide for themselves whether or not they want to be circumcised.  ",0,1384433479,null,0,false,0,cde4g5x,t3_1qj0yo,t1_cde4g5x,t1_cde0egm,null,1428663677,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Tornando ai ristoranti, anche Cracco su tripadvisor ha voti medi così-così, ci sono bettole con punteggi più alti. Sembra più un'unità di misura delle aspettative che non della qualità finale.

Il mio consiglio è di affidarti a una guida dove c'è un'autorità unica a dare i voti, tipo le guide Michelin o gambero rosso, da loro mi aspetterei una valutazione della qualità *rispetto agli altri ristoranti*, cosa che un utente social random straniero qualsiasi che va al ristorante una volta ogni 3 mesi non può dare.

&gt; This was a common tactic employed by those who argued in favour of the recent gay marriage legislation in the UK. It's lazy, intellectually bankrupt, and it amounts to little more than an ad hominem.

true,anarchisto,ROMA,Romania,"Exactly the same happened during the protests in Bucharest: They want to intimidate and/or annoy the protesters. 

We had dozens of marches/protests and, in all, I walked with the protesters more than 100 km around Bucharest. 

Here, during one of the protests there were **A LOT** of riot police (gendarmes), several hundreds, similar to the pic there. At first they were along the edges of a square, not allowing us to get into the street, arguing that we would prevent the traffic (it was Sunday at 7 PM, not much traffic). We just went to another street and used the boulevard to march to the Government building, where the gendarmes surrounded us and would not allow us to go anywhere. The strategy was that there were some ""brave"" people who were trying to break the police lines, they would be ""caught"" and while the gendarmes were busy with them, the crowd would simply go through. Next, the gendarmes tried to separate or block the crowd without much success. I don't understand why, because it was obvious that you can't stop thousands of people who are marching without arresting them or using violence. 

So, this is what you should know:

* avoid confrontation, if possible
* if the police are blocking a road, use another
* if the police are waiting for the protesters in a square, go to another square
* if the police are surrounding you, try to break their lines and the crowd should advance at once

And? Most countries don't elect their executive power, let alone the juridical institutions or administration.

Which is the fault of the EU how exactly?

I fully agree that the EP shouldn't be hamstringed so much, but the only reason those unelected bodies have so much power is that the Eurosceptic countries *insist themselves* on retaining national veto and controlling powers...

&gt;As for the CAP, it is basically a system to protect the farming industry from non-EU competition. This costs a lot of money for the tax payers, the prices are higher for the consumers and it is a problem for the development of agriculture outside of Europe, e.g. in Africa.

Recent CAP reforms are turning it around into a land management system rather than production subsidies. Export subsidies are all but gone. Prices are not higher for consumers, though it does have a tax cost. The reason prices might be higher than eg. the US is that we don't have vast empty plains where economies of scale can be exploited fully. That's never going to happen here anyway.

Once we do that, we can finally engage these things rationally, without our views being shaded by left-wing, ideological, egalitarian or emancipationist ideology.  For example we can create four categories of people in this regard:

- who are OK with homosexuals

- who think on a religious basis that homosexual acts are wrong but being homosexual in it self is not as long as one is celibate

- those who generally dislike the lack of masculinity displayed by many homosexuals so consider it as symbol of not being a manly man

- those who don't really think so deep into it but still have a visceral aversion

aus unseren Daten geht hervor, dass Sie US-Staatsbürger sind bzw. über eine doppelte Staatsbürgerschaft verfügen.

Wie Sie sicherlich wissen, sieht die neue US-amerikanische FATCA-Gesetzgebung (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) vor, dass US-Steuerzahler dem amerikanischen Staat Einsicht in ihre Konten gewähren müssen. Aufgrund bilateraler Steuerabkommen gelten diese Regelungen auch in Deutschland und führen zu erhöhten Berichtsanforderungen und zusätzlichen Meldepflichten bei MoneYou, die nur mit erheblichen finanziellen Aufwand darstellbar sind. MoneYou ist jedoch bestrebt, mit schlanken Prozessen Kostenvorteile zu erzielen, die in Form von guten Konditionen an die Kunden weitergegeben werden.

Aus diesem Grund wird MoneYou ab dem 01.11.2013 leider keine Konten mehr für US-Steuerzahler führen können.

Was bedeutet das für Sie konkret?

Da Sie ein MoneYou Tagegeldkonto besitzen, bitten wir Sie freundlich, bis spätestens 31.Oktober 2013 die Kundenbeziehung zu beenden.

Loggen Sie sich dazu bitte auf Ihrer persönlichen Seite ein. Schließen Sie zuerst Ihr Tagesgeldkonto. Ihr gesamtes Guthaben zuzüglich angefallener Zinsen wird dann auf Ihr Referenzkonto überwiesen. Nachdem das Tagesgeldkonto geschlossen ist, loggen Sie sich bitte erneut auf Ihrer persönlichen MoneYou Seite ein. Jetzt sehen Sie unter „Meine Daten“ den Menüpunkt „Kundenbeziehung beenden“. Bitte vergessen Sie nicht, sich Ihre Jahressteuerbescheinigung am Ende herunterzuladen oder auszudrucken. Dieses Dokument ist nach dem Beenden der Kundenbeziehung nicht mehr online verfügbar.

Wo finden Sie detaillierte Informationen?

Kürzlich haben wir Sie über die aktualiserten Geschäftsbedingungen von MoneYou informiert. In den neuen Geschäftsbedingungen sind diese für Sie wichtigen Änderungen aufgenommen.

It has an objective definition hate or fear to homosexual people.

Could you give an objective definition of liberals / lefties?

&gt; So I say everybody who isn't a fucking liberal / leftie should either ignore these terms or take away their power by saying yes we all are racist homophobic misogynist bigots now fuck off. 

My position is very simple is: if you support discriminate people for being homosexual you are probably homophobic. Could you give a non-homophobic reason to discriminate people for their homosexuality?

&gt; but first we need to get rid of of words like homophobic because they are not objective terms trying to describe things the way they are but mainly ideological weapons of the lefties.

It's extremely ironic that you don't like the usage of the word homophobic because isn't objective and you keep using lefties. And I don't see why you oppose to put a common tag to the last three groups.

So why then resort to national governments, who will also tax you?

&gt;It's not legitimate.

No more or no less than your national government.

&gt;Nobody voted for this.

That's why we call our governments representative democracy: we delegate negotiations and specialist work to representatives.

&gt;The money would quite obviously be better spend at UK level or even below that at a more local level.

I can't even disagree, because it's a meaningless blanket statement. However, I won't be as extreme as you and demand the abolition of national governments. I'm quite happy to have them coexist so we can shuffle competences back and forth as the circumstances demand.

&gt;If it's 'charity', then why is it building airports in Spain and not hospitals in Africa?

Because it's the EU, not the UN. In addition, it seems you haven't learned yet that your self-interest is best served by having prosperous neighbours. ""beggar thy neighbor"" isn't a viable economic policy; ironically, a lot people in the EU tend to complain that the EU has gone too far on the road of austerity, so I really don't know what you're complaining about: it's doing what you preach. It doesn't work, of course, but it seems we had to relearn that lesson.

You don't have the power to vote out any UK minister either, let alone the monarch. I don't see you getting worked up about that.

These are agencies that sub-let apartments or rooms in apartments on a short-term basis for their owners. This is usually enough to keep you going whilst you look for a more permanent place.

These sites have listings for individual flats

What Must I Know About Renting?

A rental contract (""Mietvertrag"") is either fixed-term or open-ended. In either case, you will have a time-table of fixed rent increases every year. Termination of your contract will usually have a 3-month notice period. You will have to pay a deposit - usually 1-3 months rent - which will be returnable upon the end of your contract unless you are deemed to have caused damage to the property. This money will be placed in a separate account by your landlord. Note that it is possible to ""borrow"" against this deposit at some banks, but avoid doing so, as the terms are not generous. Note that while you live in the property, you are responsible for reporting any damage or problems to the landlord, so they can fix them. If you do not, you may lose your deposit. If you do report the problems and your landlord does not fix them promptly, you may be entitled to a rent reduction. (see Mietverein)German law used to require tenants to leave the place ""as found"", usually requiring that you redecorated the place before you leave. This is no longer the case, however it can count in your favour.Be careful about the quotations for your apartment/flat (""Wohnung""). In Germany, prices are quoted ""cold"" and ""warm"" - eg cold water and warm water. Make sure that you have a good idea about additional charges - some places will have extra charges for ""Müll"" (garbage removal), heating, etc that can come as a bit of a shock. These are usually calculated once a year and sent to you.

Mietverein

It is also a good idea to become a member of a ""Mietverein"" - Renter's Union. This is a body which can advise you upon your rights as a tenant and any problems you may have.

What's all this about Kitchens?!

Strange as it may seem, Germans are very attached to their kitchens, and will often take the kitchen with them when they move. This means you're probably going to have to buy a kitchen when you rent a place. Sometimes you can buy the kitchen from the previous tenant. Either way, be prepared to fork out for one. Complete kitchens or components can be bought from Ikea (take the 5 out to Ossendorf) Bauhaus (at Barbarossa pl) and Max Bahr (Ehrenfeld, near the Music Halle). Second-hand kitchens can be found in the ""kleinanzeige"" in Köln Stadt Anzeiger or www.kalaydo.de. There are also a number of 2nd-hand appliance firms which will sell you a cooker / washing machine / dishwasher. NOTE that you must get the cooker connected by a professional electrician. All flats will have an electrical cutoff, usually by the electric meter. Make sure you know where this is. Note that this cutoff isn't a fuse box (like in older UK houses) but a trip switch. These operate by detecting loss of power from the circuit. If you are getting a repeat trip-out on any electrical circuits, get your caretaker to get an electrician in immediately. In my case, the people next door were getting electric shocks from their water, and the electrician found there were absolutely NO earths in the kitchen!

Ah..Electric. What do I do about that?

You will have to register with a power supply company - the easiest is the local utility company Rheinenergie. You will need the the meter reading of the day you move in. To be on the safe side make sure you get that together with your landlord. You can register either online (www.rheinenergie.de) or go to their service centre. Pay close attention to the letter you get from them telling you the monthly fees. If your flat has electrical water boilers, or was used by a Wohngemeinschaft, then the electrical use as estimated by them may be ridiculously high. On the other hand it might be too low, leaving you with a large back-dated payment at the end of the year. If you are adventurous, you have a choice of electrical supplier, even though the savings aren't that high (maximum 40 EUR a year). Bear in mind that some suppliers have been running a ""hard sell"" campaign (RWE) where they send people round to talk you into a ""quote"", and then you find out, when the company phones, that you have agreed to swap. Threaten them with the ""Verbraucherzentrale"". More on that later.

How do I register once I have a place?

All citizens are required to register their current address at the ""Einwohnermeldeamt"". http://www.stadt-koeln.de/buergerservice/themen/anmelden-ummelden/meldehallen-und-kundenzentrum/ Take your passport and rental contract. You will receive a copy of your registration. Keep it safe, and make several copies of it. You may be asked to produce it as proof of your place of residence. You will also have to register at the ""Aüslanderamt"" (Alien Office). If you are a European Citizen, you will receive a stamped letter which grants you equivalent rights to a native citizen. Keep this safe with your passport, as it is your proof of residency. If you are not a European Citizen, you will be granted a limited stay ""green card"". Your employer may have already sponsored you, in which case they will help you through the application process. Green Cards typically last 5 years and may, or may not, be renewable depending on the circumstances. Depending on economic circumstances, green cards may be difficult to come by or renew. For example, after the dotcom crash, many expatriates were refused extensions on their green cards.

No problem with the recall. Secret votes are potentially useful to free MEP's from pressure from certain angles; it's a double-edged sword, consider carefully.

Maybe other context, to make it clearer:

a. Weil Hans, dass er dick ist, nicht glaubt, isst er mehr.

b. Weil Hans nicht glaubt, dass er dick ist, isst er mehr.

(But does not really matter, a has a very ugly sentence structure and nearly never used, maybe in poetry like the other one said)

.  
.

About the comma, you have a main clause with a sub clause, and that sub clause has another sub clause

Weil Hans nicht glaubt,| ignoriert er sie.  
         SC1                 |         MC

And if you throw in SC2, you need to throw in more commas, too

Weil Hans |,dass er Maria kennt,|nicht glaubt,  ignoriert er sie.  
SC1 | SC2 | SC1 | MC

You can only leave commas out in ""fake"" sub clauses with verbs using ""zu"". Changing the verb phrase in the SC from ""glauben"" to ""glauben zu kennen""

Weil Hans Maria zu kennen nicht glaubt,| ignoriert er sie.

true,Djmedic,null,null,"&gt; It is legitimate. If the Constitution was ratified by country's, regardless of how people voted, then it would be illegitimate. Treaties get their legitimacy from sovereign states ratifying them, not from the populace.

The content of the European Consitution and the Lisbon treaty are the same, if people don't want the European Constitution then those in power should not bypass the people's will and ratify the Lisbon treaty even though they could. They did it anyway, this is political forfeiture and shows that when it comes to the European question, people are not listened to.

&gt; You have very limited view of what democracy is then.

De Gaulle was arguably one of the most powerful presidents thanks to the Fifth Republic he created, he was critized for the amount of power that he gave himself this way (and to the presidents after him). But he also considered that, if the people weren't okay with his policies, a president should resign. This exactly what he did when the French answered NO to a referendum  on a trivial issue he held after the 1968 protests. 

So no, my view on democracy is okay, since one of the greatest statesmen in French history showed it's possible. When the people don't share your vision on a crucial tactical element such as the currency, and you get a slap in the face that was the Swedish NO to the euro, resigning is not far-fetched.

&gt; And what is preventing you from doing this? Think of the EU as a country, and you will realize that nothing is different from how it is voting in your own country.

I don't get to elect the Commissioner who sets the retirement age, social policies, wage flexibility (towards the bottom), the financial and budgetary policies, the exchange rate of the currency. I don't have any power. My Supreme Head of State doesn't have any power. There are no politics in my country.

&gt; What non sense is this.

Go ask the Greeks, the Portugese, the Italian, the German how they feel about this comment. And the Swedes too.

&gt; But, your own countrymen can already do the same to you.

No they cannot, because if I want to change how things are done in the EU, the treaties need to be modified, and this requires all 27 other countries to agree with me. This wil never happen, so I'm leaving.

&gt; I'm not sure what you mean here.

Well, the EU bailouts aren't going to the Greeks, they're filling up the pockets of banks who bet on them  not being able to repay. A few articles popped here and there in /r/europe.

&gt; Un decreto ministeriale del 2008 consente al farmacista, in particolari casi e in situazioni di urgenza, di consegnare anche senza ricetta medica farmaci che la richiederebbero. Si è voluto così superare un inutile elemento di contrasto fra farmacista e cliente quando il farmacista è posto nelle condizioni di potersi accertare della effettiva necessità del farmaco e sia in grado di conoscerne con certezza forma farmaceutica e dosaggio.

&gt; La consegna è ammessa in tre situazioni generali:

&gt; 1) qualora si debba assicurare la prosecuzione di un trattamento per una persona affetta da patologia cronica (es. diabete , ipertensione, asma,…)

&gt; 2) qualora il paziente necessiti di non interrompere un trattamento, quale ad esempio la corretta prosecuzione di una terapia antibiotica in caso di rottura accidentale di un flacone

&gt; 3) se viene presentata una documentazione di dimissione ospedaliera emessa nello stesso giorno o nei due giorni immediatamente precedenti dalla quale risulti prescritta o, comunque, raccomandata la prosecuzione della terapia intrapresa in ospedale.

&gt; La consegna del medicinale è possibile a condizione che siano disponibili per il farmacista elementi che confermino che il paziente è in trattamento con il farmaco (ad es. precedenti ricette con il farmaco prescritto, l'esibizione di un documento attestante la patologia da cui il paziente è affetto e il relativo trattamento).

You talk about there being no secular reasons, yet earlier on you talked about homophobes who hide behind religious reasons. So, according to your arguments, there are homophobes; ordinary people who don't think they're homophobes (but who really are); and people who are homophobes but who 'hide behind' religious reasons.

 Einziger Kontakt war untereinander, ansonsten 30 Minuten Busfahrt zum Amazon Logistikzentrum. Gab nur Frühstück, kalt natürlich, ausser du gehst um 4-5 uhr morgens frühstücken. Vor Ort das wohl für Amazon normale ""Wir duzen uns hier alle. Wir sind eine Familie."" Wie sich herausgestellt hat, hilft das nur dem Management unter dem Eindruck einer harmonischen Arbeitsatmosphäre Leute RICHTIG auseinanderzunehmen falls es Fehler gab. Ich meldete mich während der Einführung 4 mal mit Fragen zur Bezahlung und versprochenen Aufstiegschancen. Niemand konnte uns Irgendetwas sagen. Am Ende ging die Bezahlung von 10,10€ auf 8,40€ auf 7,10€.

  Ausserdem wurde seltsamerweise nur mein Name und der meiner Sitznachbarin notiert, als wir uns über die anscheinende Unfähigkeit ein klein wenig empörten. Und ich rede nicht über rumschreien, ich rede über die Äusserung ""Können wir denn überhaupt irgendwelche Informationen erwarten?"" Wasser trinken bei der Arbeit war erlaubt, aber nur mit der extra von Amazon gekauften Trinkflasche. Andere gingen natürlich auch, wurden aber seltsamerweise immer aussortiert.

 Die Sicherheitsüberprüfungen, ob man nichts hat mitgehen lassen, wurden seltsamerweise immer an den selben Personen durchgeführt. Dazu kam extremer Sexismus der Vorgesetzten an der Packer-Station. Gott, wie oft die neben mir ""Süße"" und ""Kleine Maus"" genannt wurde, war absolut ekelerregend. Rennen, sitzen, anlehnen, reden waren natürlich dauernd verboten und die Quote musste sogar von Leuten am ersten Tag erfüllt werden, sonst gab es keine Übernahme.

Ich bin in der 4. Woche rausgefallen, da ich meine eigene Kochplatte mitgebracht habe, nachdem ich fast verrückt geworden bin vor lauter Gemüse und ab und an 'nen Burger. Natürlich kann Man bei Amazon essen. Aber für Jemanden, der aufgrund einer Förderaktion der Arge da ist, ist das Geld nicht gerade ausreichend, um dort täglich zu essen. Nicht die Kochplatte war Schuld, sondern das Motel Wasser, das ich zum kochen genommen habe. Durchfall, arbeitsunfähig, ausgesondert. 

Dann noch diverse spätere falsche Versprechen über Aufstiegschancen. ""Jeder hat eine Chance, schnell nach oben zu kommen!"" Ja. Nach 3 Jahren + Studium. So lang heißt es schuften im Stillen.

Bedenkt man dann noch, wie viel Geld in diesem Land direkt für fragwürdige Ziele ausgegeben wird und dass gutverdienenden Steuerhinterziehern Amnestie gewährt wird, während man den hilfsbedürftigsten das Leben noch schwerer macht, kann man nur dann noch wirklich auf ""Sozialschmarotzer"" wütend sein, wenn man bereits ist, alles andere zu ignorieren und ein Feindbild sucht, das sich noch nicht mal wehren kann. 

Und die Politiker verantwortlich zu machen bedeutet doch nur, nach ""Lösungen"" für vermutete Schlupflöcher zu suchen, die als Nebeneffekt die tatsächlich Hilfsbedürftigen die Beantragung der Hilfe noch erschweren.

Except I haven't called him a homophobe. In your crusade against me, you've missed that fact. Here, let me quote myself:

&gt; You could mean well, and your theory still leads to inequality on a practical level. Therefore, it's just as dangerous as the actual homophobes arguing against it for religious reasons.

Not good enough?

&gt; I don't think you have much of a point here. Sure homophobes exist, but genuine homophobes - ie. people with an irrational fear of homosexuality - are a tiny minority. Simply applying the label to anyone who opposes gay marriage or adoption regardless of their reasoning is not good enough.

... that's the point. Speaking out against homophobia because of the crazy ones is pointless. They're crazy. The silent majority homophobia, the one where those people get angry when they're called homophobes because they're oh-so-clearly-not, is more dangerous.

&gt; You talk about there being no secular reasons, yet earlier on you talked about homophobes who hide behind religious reasons. So, according to your arguments, there are homophobes; ordinary people who don't think they're homophobes (but who really are); and people who are homophobes but who 'hide behind' religious reasons. How convenient for you that you can apply the label to everyone.

That doesn't make any sense. You're putting the conclusion before the argument.

Eg. You oppose gay marriage. You have no idea why, but it just *feels* wrong. Then you're a homophobe. Not on the gay lynching level, but you can't articulate why you oppose gay marriage, then it's a feeling you have, not a reason.

If you're going to throw out definitions for logical fallacies, then argue right.

&gt; And calling you a scumbag wasn't the crux of my argument, so it's not an ad-hom - simply my personal opinion. Learn the difference.

So am I to understand you weren't saying anything worthwhile in that last paragraph? Just directly, outright insulting me?

Fine. It wasn't ad hominem. You're just a complete and utter hypocrite. Is that better? Or should we both pull up Wikipedia's List of Fallacies and play that dumb game? Because I can see, like, 3 already from where I'm standing.

The first is observation, the second is speculation.

Generally expatriates' observations on the negative aspects of Italian society have a strong commonality. You can dismiss them as merely anecdote or confirmation bias, or ask yourself whether they're perhaps indicative of a trend. Personally I had very few preconceptions when I moved here (I've been an expatriate in many countries so I tend to dismiss certain opinions held about other countries as mere stereotype), and my opinion has been formed by actually living here finding that not only were some of these things true, some of them were worse than the stereotypes had indicated. I have never seen any guy shouting 'ciao bella' or pinch a woman's ass in the street, but I have spent a literal year battling my local comune as an EU citizen trying to do something that generally takes about 5 minutes for an Italian to do in the UK. (So far without success.)

I agree that there are horrible people and idiots everywhere, but it sounds like you're trying to claim that dreadful bureaucracy and crazy driving is not something that is plainly and clearly observable when in Italy. Even [Romano Prodi](http://euobserver.com/economic/119144) remarked on the bureaucracy, and he's most decidedly not an expatriate.

Secondly, expatriates of any nationality make observations about the places they're currently living. Your English is immaculate so I presume you have lived in a non-Italian location - have you ever commented negatively on where you were? 

I have a lot of expatriate Italian friends who live in the UK. If you wish to observe - as they do - that compared to Italians, British people are generally drunkards, we can get overly aggressive when drunk, our health service sucks, we are dirty (particularly because of our love of carpets and the lack of bidè in our bathrooms) and there is a high proportion of fatties amongst us, go right ahead. It's their right to hold that opinion and I tend to agree with most of the observations; I'll argue with these friends only when I think they've misinterpreted the situation. (Note that dirty public bathrooms and pickpockets were not mentioned by either of us in this thread.)

So that's the observation part.

The speculation part, well, that's just it: speculation. If you can see past denying that our observations may have a little validity, maybe you can be helpful and try to explain *why* these things happen, to educate us and stop us from posting potentially insulting hypotheses.",0,1384449565,null,0,false,0,cde9sno,t3_1qlx46,t1_cde9sno,t1_cde980o,null,1428661032,8,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,8

Washing your hands works like this:

You mechanically remove bacteria from your hands with the help of running water as (opposed to *killing* bacteria with heat).

Now, the fatty secretions of your skin contain lots of bacteria, so you will also want to remove that hydrophobic, greasy layer. 

Water of course does not readily do that. You can either speed this process up by using warm water and rubbing a lot (this will take some time)...

Or you can just use soap, because it makes fatty stuff water soluble even at room temperature and below.

As I wrote above, I think ""eager for news/something new"" is a better translation for ""neugierig"", because as you say, while curiosity can get you in trouble, it's not completely negative as ""greedy"" implies. That goes for both English and German.

I offer this evidence:
While ""neugierig"" is the adjective, the noun is ""die Neugier"" (curiosity), but the alternative form ""die Neugierde"" exists. This indicates a relation to ""[die Begierde](http://dict.leo.org/ende/index_de.html#/search=Begierde)"".
