It usually is better to rent one than to buy one, unless you really plan to live there a long time. Most flats are directly rented by the landlord. There are realtors but you usually have to pay them a provision for finding something and it is easier doing it yourself. Realtors are good, if you don't have time and enough money.

For the flat itself, you wanna make sure it has enough power sockets, windows are where you want them (i.e. some people wanna wake up with sun in their eyes thus window of the bedroom to the east). Heating is important cause it costs a lot, especially high ceilings which mean high maintance costs, cause the room needs more energy to be heated. If you can find out, neighbors living habits could help you heat less (i.e. having someone living above and below you, who are almost always there, will lower your need to heat as they will and usually that is enough).

If you actually read what I wrote you'll see find that's EXACTLY what I said. 

My contention was that it's stupid to use GDP (PPP) to determine the size of an economy- that's not what it's used for- you use nominal GDP. Russia ranks well below the OECD average income levels when you use median household income, which is the proper metric to use if you're attempting measure Russian household wealth. GDP (PPP) is great for getting a rough measurement of a nation's purchasing power- i.e. price levels within a country- but that's about it.

I don't think businesses should be able to allow smoking inside unless they have the infrastructure to protect non-smokers from other people's smoke. It's not as easy as ""non-smokers will go elsewhere if it's allowed"", and there are so many factors in play that, without a strict ban protecting them, many non-smokers would inevitably be exposed to the harm of other people's decision. Also, the situation is not analogous to other attitudes which may be annoying for some people or make them uncomfortable, it's a direct health hazard: it's like if people were allowed to go into a restaurant and spray poison into the air just because the owner is okay with it.

For me, like I said at the beginning, the rule about smoking is: the decision affects you exclusively? cool, your choice. Are you harming other people with it? then you shouldn't be able to do it.

...

&gt;The anticipated funding shortfall is partly a function of Greece's economy remaining stuck in recession as well as *the slow pace of the country's privatization program and other reforms.*

...

&gt;In addition, Greek Economy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis told German daily Die Welt earlier this month that *he expects Europe to agree to another debt haircut for the country*

&gt;""There will be a significant cut,"" Jörg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology and a member of an advisory council for the Finance Ministry, told the paper. ""Greece's ability to shoulder its debts has not been guaranteed.""

So Greece needs even more money, in particular because it is cannot reform quickly enough or deeply enough. It is getting money now, but the money is being spread out to encourage reforms, which it is not doing (to the extant necessary). So Greece is now simultaneously asking for more money, and also asking to have portions of its previous debt written off.

This must be a frustrating situation all around. Surely the Greeks have had enough of this bullshit. But I can imagine how grating the situation is for the Germans. They are basically in a position where they must loan more money, on top of the money they have already loaned, all while being told to forget about ever seeing the money from previous loans. I am aware it is much more nuanced than this, but from a German perspective this must seem like throwing good money after bad.

Implying that driverless cars will be as bad as drivers who don't pay attention. That's the whole point to do these kinds of cars. To eliminate the human error.

&gt;Ahh yeah, fuck the poor they don't have jobs to go to anyway.

ANY technology that goes into mass production will eventually become cheaper. Case and point: computers. This shouldn't really be a concern at the moment.

&gt;As a utopian ideal it's something of a failure then.

Well, mostly an ideal is an abstract idea that is almost impossible to achieve. There are things relatively close to it though.

&gt;Your information will be tracked, perhaps like the 5th Element in time. Certain people may or may not get restricted access via GPS.

So it changes nothing. A lot of people are using GPS navigation as well as a lot of phones have it built in. This issue is much broader than limiting it to driverless cars.

&gt;So think of a networked car system relying on intercommunication and external services. 

If a driverless car has to significantly rely on this then it is a fault. Even military grade equipment isn't faultless in communication. Driverless cars should mostly rely on its own sensors. Intercommunication should not be necessary.



Just think about it. Accidents are usually caused by either drivers not paying attention or having late reaction time. Machines are far better at these kinds of things. Even though I love driving my car I don't see this as a necessarily bad thing. Having the car deal with congestion by itself giving me time to do stuff on my laptop for instance. My car driving home by itself after I drove it to the airport to avoid parking fees. Going to a party and not caring how much I drink because the car can drive me home.

Most people don't find it fun to spend hours driving the same route to work every morning and evening, especially given how much time you spend sitting in traffic. The point is that you can take back hours of your day to do other things. If, for instance, you work for eight hours, sleep for eight hours, and spend an hour commuting each day, having a driverless car would mean you'd increase by a quarter the amount of time you are awake and not working. You're getting back a major proportion of your life.

There would also be possibilities with completely autonomous cars which are not currently available- for instance, the car could drive through the night as you slept, or it could come and pick you up. That would mean essentially a universal taxi service, at the per-mile cost of driving your own car, which would be astonishingly useful. It would mean that people who are currently excluded from driving cars would no longer be so. No-one needs to drive their children to school, old people and the disabled have complete freedom of movement.

true,summerleaves,null,null,"Just last week I finished a thesis which is partly on the extent to which EU law guarantees net neutrality and I am a bit confused by this article. 

Nobody in the Commission disputes the value of open internet. They just think or thought that consumers should be able to have prioritized/separate access to Spotify, for example, if they wish to choose such a subscription (like in [Germany](http://thenextweb.com/media/2012/08/30/spotify-deutsche-telekom/); see Neelie Kroes' previous [position](http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/neelie-kroes/netneutrality/)). That is why the current policy is one of transparency. ISPs are to be transparent about their blocking and throttling/prioritizing practices so that consumers can vote with their feet. When things really get out of control and consumers don't have a choice, this can supposedly be remedied through competition law. Also, governments can impose quality of service requirements to prohibit blocking/throttling practices they deem unfavourable (such as the blocking of competing services, like mobile phone companies who block Skype). Apart from these restrictions, ISPs and content providers can at the moment agree to offer priorizited/separate access to specific content.* The regulation that the article mentions therefore wouldn't necessarily change anything.

The article, however, says that the proposal would undo a policy of net neutrality. 
&gt;The European Union's Executive Commission was willing to dump a previous policy ensuring equal treatment of Internet users by banning additional charges for higher speeds and better transmission quality, the German business daily Handelsblatt reported Wednesday.

Does anybody know which policy this refers to? Or did I just hand in a thesis which completely overlooked existing regulations?

Even if the proposed regulation doesn't change things, it does matter because Neelie Kroes (vice-president of the Commission in charge of the Digital Agenda) recently changed her position and started to [advocate net neutrality](http://euobserver.com/news/120456). It may be that she will also propose a regulation. There is still hope.

Dear US, the thing is war will probably not start anytime soon. None of your enemies actually care about us nor do they want to attack us. We're talking North Korea and Middle Eastern countries. I think that if needed we can handle an invasion, which is very very unlikely to happen. And even if we don't I'm sure we can hold the enemy off for some time until you come and save us. No one wants to harm your self-proclaimed hero status but you don't need these bases. You pay for them , we don't need them.

I think of NATO as an outdated thing. It was needed when the Cold War was still a thing. You see in this article Russia is mentioned as some possible threat to us. Which is not true. We buy their products, they buy ours. Sure, there is still some distance between us but we have rather good economical bonds. They won't attack us. Why would they do that? Apart from the fact that it would be a quite stupid move economically wise, I do not see one solid reason for them to attack.

Soluzione trovata dal bigliettaio di Roma Termini: un treno interregionale che passava alle h23.15 da Roma Tiburtina con arrivo previsto alle h07.00, ovviamente del giorno dopo, a Milano Centrale. 

Bene, alternative non ce n'erano, pigliamo la metro e aspettiamo il treno. Si presenta con una ventina di minuti di ritardo, e speranzosi saliamo.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"First of all, let me note that I don't appreciate you taking apart my comment, changing the order of things and quote sniping specific parts out of context. With that said:

&gt; Yes, credit was easy. No, if credit is easy, you don't have to take it up. [...] You are trying to blame lenders for lending willingly trusting Eurozone peripheral governments/corporates to pay up - rather than blaming those governments/corporates for binging on debt to ignite housing bubbles or to pay off pensioners. 

The problem is that if no one would take up that debt, then this chain of loans would collapse one link earlier. Those ""investors"" had the credit ready and had to push it and if they didn't manage to then their profit predictions would go awry and then they'd be needing a bailout earlier. For example, if the Greek government wouldn't take up that debt in 2005-2008 then it would need a bailout earlier because of the loss of competitiveness. So, I'm not blaming anyone in particular. All I see is a problematic system that needs to change. 

&gt; My opinion is that a defaulting debtor is much more morally repugnant than an overly trusting creditor/investor.

That's just like your opinion, man. I don't see why your opinion holds any merit. Care to explain yourself?

&gt; You are rather rude. It doesn't help your argument - especially given that you don't give any alternative analysis tools, probability-theoretical methods, hypotheses, data points -- or anything else other than ad-hominems.

So, at any time someone wants to critique something, they are required to provide a better working alternative that fixes all problems? My claim from the start is that drawing conclusions for these kinds of systems is inherently hard and I criticised your simplistic methods. I don't understand why that would require me to provide you with my own perfect methods. That would take forever and I don't claim to have solved the fundamental problems of soft sciences anyway. I apologise for being rude but you were the one who arrogantly made all these ridiculous claims. 

&gt; Not you, but that is the implied statement at the core of Ferguson's argument! If German/Dutch/Finnish corporates haven't benefited from the currency weakness due to association with countries which are less export-oriented (which I claim they haven't in a significant way), then how has the Euro helped Germany/NL/Finland to turn from a current account deficit to a surplus? And what is the reasoning for making their taxpayers guarantee all the debts racked up by the Italians and Greeks, rather than Italians or Greeks themselves?

The article makes no such claim. I personally do agree with it though. My understanding is that you can't have a monetary union without a fiscal union. The core countries did benefit from easier access to the markets of the periphery and so on, but that is not the justification I would use. As long as a monetary union is not sustainable without a fiscal union, then there's no point in denying that the taxpayers of the rich countries will have to pay for stuff in the poor countries. It's the same thing that happens between regions of the same country. 

&gt; They are similar in a large number of ways, industrial development, automation, technology level, tax rates, social systems. Certainly more similar than any other countries, and hopefully similar enough for their non-adoption of the Euro to be treated as a natural experiment. 

So, you take half a dozen attributes, you arbitrarily declare that they're about the same (and a lot of them aren't, or at least it isn't obvious that they are). Then you declare that these attributes are enough to characterise the whole economy. You don't take scale into account. You look at each country's economy as working in a vacuum. 

Do I really need to spell out to you that this way of analysing the situation is far too simplistic to be trustworthy? 

&gt; If you reject any comparability, then there is no counterfactual as to what happens to a similar economy in or out of the Eurozone -- and that means there's no numerical evidence, only narrative by spin-doctors like Ferguson. That's why I try to compare countries who adopted the Euro with countries who didn't.

This is numbers fetishism, plain and simple. Because you lack the analytic tools to properly address the situation, you use any system, no matter how crude, that allows you to make a quantitative comparison and call it a day? Most economists nowadays at least accept that their models are mostly nice thought experiments. But you, you're something else. The point of science is to make accurate models of reality that give us predictive power. If you can't do that, it's not really science, no matter how many numbers you use. 

In complex systems like economies, qualitative comparisons are useful for this exact reason. I don't think this article in particular does a great job, but your simplistic analogies are far worse. 

&gt; Have a look yourself[1] at Eurostat. I can assure you that in the last 15 years, both Sweden and Switzerland grew faster than Germany.

Actually, that's not even true for the years mentioned in the graph. However, I don't see any evidence that growth percent is a measure that adequately alleviates the difference of scale in the economies of these countries? For example, a bigger country might have less room for growth than a smaller one. There's no way to tell. But even if I were to accept this, you still have the problem I outlined above, i.e. that the countries are not so similar economically that all factors except participation in the eurozone are irrelevant. 

&gt; Are you sure? Last I looked, Iceland's GDP is more than 20% off from its 2007 peak levels when measured in EUR or USD, while Slovenia is back at all time highs in terms of GDP.

Look at quality of life indicators instead of GDP. That's what counts in the end. Also, this was not my sole argument against this point. Your taking apart my comment and attacking overly specific points in random order muddles the waters and makes it difficult to keep track of the debate. 

&gt; However, I am still missing any alternative reasoning for why it is morally right for Greek/Italian people to demand indefinite transfer payments* from Germany/NL/FI -- or why the German/Dutch/Finnish tax payer should agree to this permanent transfer voluntarily. 

There is no moral argument. If we accept the argument that monetary union implies a fiscal union then you either have to accept fiscal transfers or disband the eurozone. Both options are fine and I'm not making a moral judgement either way. If we don't accept that argument, then we had 5 years of austerity so far and the situation is only getting worse. You have to provide an alternate account of events that explains why this is so. 

&gt; I am trying to make a case that bailouts and fiscal transfers are not a moral necessity, and that the core countries have the moral high ground which Ferguson claims for the peripher

No one has the moral high ground really. This is just silly. You take a serious conversation and turn it into a childish game about who is the most righteous? Come on, spare me. 

&gt; It is also fairly evident that it is not an economically advantageous step for the core countries (otherwise they would have done it immediately)

By the same logic, the peripheral countries would not have entered the eurozone because they knew it wasn't advantageous. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone tries to hold on to short-sighted advantageous situations that are ultimately unsustainable. It is equally true about the periphery countries (that went on a credit binge that couldn't last when they entered the eurozone) as for the core countries (that think they can keep all the benefits of the monetary union without paying for it).

No problem, we understand how this can happen, and it's really our fault for not getting it right the first time. Please send us the incorrect item at your convenience and be sure to let us know the shipping charges so we can promptly refund you. Oh wait, that item was only 25 pounds... don't worry about returning it, just do what you like with it.""

In Germany... ""We're sorry about that, but we need you to send us a picture of the item first so we can check that you really got the wrong size.""  Send picture. Wait a few days. Follow up to make sure they got the picture. ""Yea, we got it, but this guy in our other office needs to look at it and he's not back for a week. We'll let you know."" A week later. ""Uh, we got the picture, but it looks like you opened the top of the plastic. We can't take it back. No, it doesn't matter that it was difficult to see the size when it was packaged, and you didn't think to check before opening it. It was physically possible to see the size if you had handled the package in this very particular way. The contract states that we don't have to take any item back if the packaging was broken.""

I don't know what the last letter in the first name(?) right before ""Schuster"" is. It's different from an [r], looks more like an [n]. Same with the last letter in ""besonde[n/s/r]"", this word doesn't make sense with any of them (""besonders"" is a word).
And what's *28/XII 20.*?

*the n in this illegible abbreviation looks different to the other n's and u's.
**both words make no sense with an n as the last letter. First letter looks like a K but I'm not sure if ""Küssen"" was written ""Küßen"".

To my knowledge the best ways to get discounted fares are:

* being between 12 and 25 - there are all sorts of discounts for young travellers - Europasses are probably available from other outlets than SNCF 
* being under 12
* being over 60
* being a member of a large family (3+ kids) - this probably only applies to French residents
* booking your trip well in advance (it used to be that you could get tickets at half price if you purchased 30 or 60 days in advance, or something like that; conditions may have changed)
* being a frequent traveller
* travelling in group
* buying a pass

My conclusion at that time was that the net neutrality is an important principle, who has driven internet to what it is today (a flourishing economy) and can almost be used to define what internet is, and that it was important to keep it. One of the reasons that is interesting to point out in this context (didn't read the article, just your comment) is to guarantee competition, in fact most websites we see now are quite young, and probably wouldn't have existed if some websites were preffered from other, even if it was a customer's choice (for example, facebook would have probably not been choosed on a ISP's level at it's beginning when msn was still the top social media, and thus, would have been slowlier, disadvantaging facebook against msn.)

So, while favorizing websites choosen by user can seems like a good idea because ISP's cannot impose their choices and customers basically get a better service, it harms the competition, and thus in the long run, it harms the service offered to customers (less choices =&gt; always a bad thing).

Net neutrality is good for competition, it's good for freedom, it's good for customers, why the fuck don't we already have a law for this?",0,1374106905,null,0,false,0,cb4vo92,t3_1ihlbr,t1_cb4vo92,t1_cb4mshs,null,1430429508,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Today, we have countries that were far bigger than the Roman Empire and Persia. They will not disband due to geographic problems anymore. You can send a squad of hitmen to the other side of the planet to get rid of insurgents. Never before in history of mankind was this possible.

Our laws govern *every aspect of life*. It's unprecedented. 17th century man would be terrified by the intensity and reach of government control. 

In the past there are many great individuals who sparked revolutions. Moral, religious, scientific, political... they were hunted down and executed for their views. Sometimes they didn't mind that, having a heroic attitude, ideals larger than life.

Today, a government can shut you up before you have your views heard. 

Historically, scientists were always trying to work *despite* the State. Many people with new, unconventional ideas about the world have been burned, coerced and subdued. Once science was able to deliver new fantastic weaponry and means of control, it was tamed and put on a leash. Today, science is a tool in the hands of governments and companies. How many scientists work at L'Oreal? Far more than we need.

It doesn't matter much whether something is publicly or privately owned. Powerful entities such as large corporations continue to consolidate their power further and further. A single person can do absolutely nothing about it; not can an entire society, in fact. 

Four banks own 60% of the financial sector in America. Banks amounted to 10% of the economy in 1950. Today that number is around 40%. That should be terrifying news. But it's not discussed at all.

I can see how you view alarmist news on almost all subreddits. I tend to agree. But what I think is that the Internet, much like any media, focuses on hysteria instead of causes of the malice we pretend to fight against.

The atrocities of Nazi Germany, for instance, were rooted in two things: the first was the misfortune of the German people. But that alone doesn't push people to war. What was needed was an artificial enemy: the *Untermensch*. 
Totalitarian governments always point towards an external enemy, creating a division between ""them"" and ""us"". Modern media do the very same. Constantly looking for scapegoats, they raise hysteria because it makes money.

There are small freedoms and large freedoms. Freedom of movement around Europe will become pretty insignificant if all countries in Europe devolve into oligarchies. An American can move wherever he/she wants, but wherever he ends up, it's more or less the same.

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.

* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.

* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)

* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.

* [Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!

* In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.

* Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 

* [Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.

* [Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.

* [Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 

* [Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing

* In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!

* Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

* ADIDAS and PUMA have their headquarters and big outlet shopping centres in the small town of Herzogenaurach, 25km north-west of Nuremberg. If you want to go shopping for cheap sportswear (and more), you should consider a visit. Also if you are interested in [modern](http://www.vb.com/puma/puma-hq-herzogenaurach-m.jpg) [architecture](http://www.herzogenaurach.de/typo3temp/pics/e9cc906d7d.jpg).

**Bamberg:**

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  

* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.

* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the [""Alte Hofhaltung""](http://www.emiksch.de/Lions/2007/Bilder/slides/Bamberg_Alte_Hofhaltung.jpg) where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)

* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""

* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above

* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.

* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.

* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.spezial-keller.de/index_files/stacks_image_44.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.

* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.

* Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

* Bamberg is a University Town with currently about 12k Students (at 70k people), so you'll find young people everywhere.

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recommend ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live (0,5 litre of beer: beginning at 1,50€), and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car, but there are is a list of [bus lines](http://vgn.de/freizeitlinien/) (german link) that are esp. for recreational/free time destinations like wildlife parks or hiking from may 1st till november. Click ""herunterladen (PDF)"" to download a pdf with a map and images to see what to expect and maybe use google translate (google translate did not work on the homepage when I tried it, so i recommend the pdf ""workaround""). Here is a [map of the region with public transport lines](http://www.vgn.de/ib/site/documents/media/f387bb36-6624-65dd-c17b-5cde6c7b84f4.jpg/VG_Freizeit_Prospekt.jpg) that are interesting for tourists, green are regular routes, purple routes are weekend and holiday only and only in the summer while orange are weekend only during the whole year. If you need help to find the right trip, message me and I'll translate and help you to find the busses etc.

* [Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremberg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle (well, actually two castles) there and live there. 

* [Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.

* The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.

* At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.

**Traditional Food** you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

**Breweries I would recommend, although all are great:**

* Brauerei Wagner in Merkendorf
* Brauerei Goldener Löwe in Buttenheim (where the Levi Strauss museum is)
* Schlenkerla in Bamberg (The Rauchbier - that means Smoked beer- is a famous speciality, tastes like bacon) 
* Fässla in Bamberg
* Grasser in Huppendorf
* Klosterbrauerei in Weissenohe (founded 1050, one of the oldest breweries in germany, great food also!)

(Typical beer types in the region are ""helles"" and ""dunkles"", but also ""Märzen"" or ""Bockbier"") 

**Some Festivals in the Region:**

* [Sandkirchweih Bamberg](http://www.sandkerwa.de/startseite/) 22.-26. August

And they drink Kölsch, which is a tasteless wannabe beer, served in miniature glasses and only available inside of cologne and some towns around it, the rest of Germany doesn't touch it.  They feel  very proud for their beer so tell them how great it is when you come here.

Cologne is famous for its carnival which starts at 11.11. At 11:11h the whole town goes crazy at this time.
Carnival Season celebrates its peak at Rosenmontag ""rosemonday"" which is most times a day of February.
Followed by a week of excessive party and Kölsch drinking and ends on a sad Wednesday. 

I live here for over 12 years, I have seen most of the big cities of Germany and Europe but cologne is still something special for me, it's not because of the great architecture or the wonderful River Rhine, it's the people here which are much more friendly than in every other town I have visited. you still find many Idiots around here but nowhere else it seems to be so uncomplicated to get in touch with other people.

Three high-quality epidemiology studies specifically examined the possibility that use of snus causes oral cancer, and found no relationship. Of three additional studies that looked at the development of multiple cancer types and an association with snus use, only one study found a significant association with oral cancer.

true,radaway,PORT,Portugal,"&gt; Finance Minister Vítor Gaspar, a political independent and the man who had been viewed as a guarantor of Portugal's course of austerity measures, plunged the country into a crisis when he resigned two weeks ago. Since the government headed by liberal-conservative Social Democrat Pedro Passos Coelho came into office in June 2011, Gaspar had been in charge of implementing the troika reforms. One of the reasons he decided to resign is that he had lost popular support. In addition, labor unions and, more recently, employer associations have been rebelling against the austerity measures.

They conveniently forget to mention the other reason why he resigned. He says the austerity policy he was implementing and that was demanded by the troika is not working, as it is impossible to reach the deficit targets with such a huge crash of internal demand and such a rise in unemployment, both of which had a huge effect on tax returns.  
  
He basically said in his resignation letter - I was hired to do one thing. Well... That thing didn't work, and now I have no credibility or political support.

Let's be honest, the only reasonable thing from a legal standpoint here is blame ultimately will still rest on the ""human driver"" of the car should there be an accident.  It's incredibly unlikely laws will be written holding the software engineers who designed the self-driving system to account, or the company supplying the car, as that would effectively kill the industry overnight.

So, you're left sitting behind the wheel, not actually driving, but concentrating just as much as if you were.  Sleep is impossible, so is reading, or doing anything else.  I just don't see the attraction personally, and I'm pretty skeptical that, having sat doing nothing for two hours whilst the car autopilots, when it comes to make a split second decision to intervene whilst travelling at speed, the ""human driver"" will be in any fit shape to intervene adequately.

(On this point, there's some evidence to back it up: whilst I was in Italy the city I was living in tried to implement a self-driving bus scheme that required a human to sit behind the wheel to help if anything happened.  The bus was supposed to follow lines painted on the road, with a camera system guiding the bus along its route.  The problem was, when it came time for the human drivers to intervene, they'd all switched off from boredom and found it incredibly difficult to do anything.  Similarly, this is a problem that airline pilots are increasingly reporting with autopilot: they're left sat doing nothing whilst the plane flies itself, so they basically ""switch off"".)",0,1374138595,null,0,false,0,cb54djg,t3_1ih08j,t1_cb54djg,t1_cb4j9zg,null,1430425335,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Suppose ISPs decide to block a young service that competes with their own services, and the consumers don't know about it yet - they'll hardly be able to vote with their feet and the ISPs and content providers lose a competitor. If all ISPs block Skype on mobile networks the consumer doesn't have much choice either. Why do we think that ISPs are so bound to the wishes of the consumer? Transparency on blocking and throttling practices and traffic management techniques is supposed to ensure this. But most consumers would not be able to make a well thought-out decision regarding the type of subscription they'd prefer when faced with all this technical information. 

The downside is that Internet subscriptions become more expensive, at least when we look at what happened in the Netherlands. There, net neutrality was made mandatory (subject to 4 narrow exceptions) in response to the blocking of or charging extra for access to Skype on mobile internet. One ISP blocked it completely and another wanted to block it only if the consumer refused to pay the extra fee. Then BAM net neutrality! and they weren't allowed to do either, resulting in an increase in subscription prices. Now mobile Internet users who don't use Skype have to pay more as well as users who do use Skype. Of course they can choose a different Internet subscription with a lower bandwidth or data limit, but what if they want to use their Internet all the time for Spotify? In this situation I think it is important to consider that some consumers might gladly have chosen a cheaper subscription without Skype. So it might not always be good for costumers. 

That said, net neutrality fully protects the potential of the Internet to be a platform where everybody can send and receive expressions. It is great for freedom of expression. ",0,1374138868,null,0,1374147849,0,cb54ewf,t3_1ihlbr,t1_cb54ewf,t1_cb4vo92,null,1430425317,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Un modo e' quello di leggere molto - la letteratura non deve necessariamente essere noiosa, e libri - oltre ad appassionarti - miglioreranno di molto il modo in cui ti esprimi.

Cerca di imparare almeno due lingue - Inglese, piu' a scelta francese o spagnolo; al limite tedesco se ti interessa la musica e la matematica (non e' difficile). Sapere le lingue ti dara' l'opportunita' di conoscere persone, paesi, idee e modi di vita che senza ti sarebbero preclusi.

A scuola, mi raccomando di curare la matematica - ti servira' molto in futuro (dal pianificare gli investimenti ad Analisi 1/2 all'Universita'), e se la trascuri non e' facile poi recuperare.

Assuming that there is never enough capacity to always transmit every packet instantly, you wouldn't be able to enjoy your games and videos during peak hours without such an exception. Of course content providers should not be able to buy prioritized access. That should be included in the exception. But it is a trade-off. Would you rather be able to video-chat during peak hours or would you rather have a catch-all prohibition that is easier to enforce? 

My biggest worry is that ISPs are less incentivized to invest in capacity if they can simply throttle torrent traffic. Perhaps pressure from governments and private groups could mitigate this effect, but it is still a risk.

true,Eonir,SWED,Sweden,"I was thinking more about the way radio enabled governments to control vast lands. In the old Roman Empire or ancient China, information traveled as fast as a horse. Radio and the telegraph changed that forever. 

As for your particular example, it can be viewed in many ways. Let's forget for a minute that there's a neutral arbiter of the State, and think in terms of influence. Let's suppose there is a central entity that controls most of the bandwidth. If it's a corrupt government, it will sell most of the bandwidth to certain private interests. If the entity is a large company, it might impose absurd prices and allow only for rich companies to buy any shares in the spectrum. And if it's some kind of totalitarian regime, it will censor the radio waves by filtering who can and who cannot transmit.

Government control is not the only kind of regulatory force. Many of today's technological standards have been developed and agreed upon by private companies which developed them. The entire world of IT was developed due to private innovation and such. You can hack your bluetooth device to work against the standard, but you won't be legally able to use the BT logo.

Europe uses 50Hz mains not because a government body decided it's the optimal solution, it's because of a German company called AEG. They had a monopoly on generating electricity, so their standard was adopted - first in Germany, then in the rest of Europe and most of the world. Governments were secondary in this regard.

I'm not against government regulation. This is just a different kind of discussion. I just think that in broad terms, governments and powerful people use technology to further consolidate their power. Your example is very specific and minute, even, compared to the anarchy that follows the fall of an empire, wouldn't you agree?",0,1374142257,null,0,false,0,cb54urh,t3_1ihlbr,t1_cb54urh,t1_cb54mvx,null,1430425112,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Some notes on the Russian judiciary, and how it isn't as independent as you'd expect other European institutions to be: 

&gt; Senior Russian officials, such as Dmitry Medvedev emphasised the need to improve the independence of the judiciary.

&gt;However, cases are not always as clear cut as people make them out to be. For instance, in the 2008 Boyev vs Solovyov libel case (Boyev being an allegedly corrupt official and Solovyov the one who made the accusations) it would be **expected that Boyev (a government minister) would win against the broadcaster Vladimir Solovyov**. The first deputy chair of the Supreme Arbitration Court, Yelena Valyavina, showed extraordinary support for Solovyev’s claims and the case was dropped by Boyev.

&gt;**Krugovaya poruka, which is a sense of mutual accountability and control felt in the judicial setting, influences judicial committees which oversee the independence of the judiciary.** Progressive reforms made in 2001 at the start of the Putin presidency fought against this contradiction, by appointing outsiders into judicial committees. This was by all accounts successful, but not implemented widely enough.

&gt;Former President Medvedev has admitted that the legislation that is supposed to guarantee independence of the courts does not, saying that “**pressure, telephone calls and … outright bribery” are rife “practices** and attitudes that stand in the way of building a new, powerful, and affluent Russia.” Whilst progress has been made, as the Boyev vs Solovyov case has shown as well as a weaker tolerance for **interference from the oligarchy** there are still many problems.

They teach us that they are of Bulgaro-Cuman origin. 

From what I've studied of the medieval history of the region things are like a big bowl of spaghetti, with nobles one moment being independent, then recognizing the Bulgarian tsar, then the Hungarian king and so on. Enough to give even G.R.R. Martin a headache and with more drama than a group of hisghschool girls

And people calling themselves a bunch of things at the same time. National identity was not a thing at that time and people lived along each other without caring a lot. Thus a Wallachian would be just a guy that lives in Wallachia, no matter if he is from Bulgarian, Romanian or Chinese origin. 

However this was not very convenient for the forming of national identity that took part in the 18-19th century.  The myth of the noble and mighty [insert balkan nation here] used to rule all over the place and was never defeated in an honest fight, until betrayed by our neighbours/ defeated by the ottoman horde was born... - a narrative that has a lot to do with the wars in the first part of the 20-th century and the wet dreams of nationalists from the all the region

You see this is my No. 1 problem with liberal thinking. The cult of autonomy. Meaningful freedom is not the freedom to do what you want to, but to do what is actually good for you. Of course questions like who and who gets to tell that are very good questions, but ""nobody no way "" is just not a constructive answer to that. Freedom to do what you want does nothing but enslave you to your own ego, vanity an desires. Every premodern thinker understood that.

The cult of autonomy also means that because everybody lives for their own pitiful little desires and goals, each is as good as the other, there is no ranking, and no hierarchy, because there is no shared goal, and every ranking, if rational, derives from being fit of a certain purpose.  Hence this whole absurdity of egalitarianism. 

Feel free to call it fascist, I developed a tough skin against bullying like that. I just call it anti-modern and with that, _sane_.

Thing is; had these individual countries kept money within control they would never have needed to have let spending run out, forcing them all into unemployment.

Reading ""The Hungarians"" by Pal Lendvai was a real eye-opener. I'm half Hungarian, but I only studied Romanian history in school. Reading the Hungarian perspective explained a lot of things that seemed weird.

&gt;And people calling themselves a bunch of things at the same time. National identity was not a thing at that time

I know. Case in point: both we and the Hungarians claim John Hunyadi and his son, Matthias Corvinus (greatest Hungarian king) as ""our own"".

&gt;people lived along each other without caring a lot. 

People still had plenty of religious and class reasons to hate each other.

&gt;Thus a Wallachian would be just a guy that lives in Wallachia, no matter if he is from Bulgarian, Romanian or Chinese origin. However this was not very convenient for the forming of national identity that took part in the 18-19th century.

There is [a very nice letter](http://tiparituriromanesti.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/corespondenta-intre-stefan-cel-mare-si-boierii-braileni-1481/) that the boyars of Braila (in Wallachia) sent to Stephen the Great, ruler of Moldavia, in which they basically tell him to go fuck himself (in response to one of his letters demanding something). Something like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Repin_Cossacks.jpg). 

Also, there are a lot of battles in which the 2 principalities fought against each other, one on the side of the Ottomans (blasphemy!), the other on the side of the Hungarians (double blasphemy!!).

But the official narrative stresses the moments of ""brotherhood"" and whatnot, as if they felt their shared ""nationhood"", which of course is BS.

&gt;he myth of the noble and mighty [insert balkan nation here] used to rule all over the place and was never defeated in an honest fight, until betrayed by our neighbours/ defeated by the ottoman horde was born..

We can already argue that states have already lost their sovereignty.

European countries are already highly dependant on the union economically, financially and politically. Also you point out a loss of culture; how and why would there be one?

&gt;Unified Education
Using which system?

There doesn't have to be a specific system to base a European education but a compatibility of systems/ a sort of guide to make sure students from all countries are taught to roughly the same standard. It makes applying to higher education easier and enables students to enjoy the freedoms of movement, work, and life given through the union. 

&gt;Unified Army
This is just simply a retarded idea. Many nations already do not meet their national defence requirements as set out in NATO, an ""EU Military"" would just be Britain and France carrying and protecting the rest.

This is already been done. The armies of France, UK and Germany already participate in training programs together and use English to communicate and follow a chain of command.

Je pense qu'elles ne voient pas la différence entre la religion personnelle de chacun chacune, et la religion organisé. Je connais beaucoup de gens croyants qui voient les femmes et les hommes comme égaux et n'en ont pas grand chose à faire que les couples gays se marient. J'ai même des amis dans une église alternative en Angleterre qui sont certainement plus tolérants que beaucoup de gens sur cette planète et essayent un max d'appliquer le message de Jésus pour aider les autres et accepter les gens marginaux. Au-delà de ça c'est vrai que les **organismes** religieux ne sont pas tendre envers les femmes, d'ailleurs je me sens autant blessés par les positions du Vatican sur l'avortement, la contraception et la vision essentialiste de la femme que par certaines positions dans L'Islam. Sans parler du fait que à peu près aucune des grandes religions n'autorisent les femmes à tenir des postes importants. Comme le disait un des monsieur de la Church of England l'année dernière qui a voté à ce sujet, 'women are not made to lead'... No comment.

Donc effectivement, il ne faut pas mettre tout le monde dans le même panier, je suis d'accord avec toi, je suis athée mais je tiens à respecter les croyances de chacun chacune du moment qu'elles n'influent pas le gouvernement et la sphère légale publique. Des églises ne veulent pas marier des couples gays, aucun problème, en tant qu'institution culturelle (leur statut aujourd'hui en France) elles ont le droit, mais que ces gens-là ne viennent pas dire à l'état ce qu'il a ou n'a pas le droit de faire.

En revanche je pense tout de même que tout ce patacaisse autour de Notre-Dame était franchement excessif, ce n'est qu'une paire de seins. Si Dieu a crée le corps humain je ne vois pas en quoi il est choquant. J'ai visité une église il y a quelques années à Venise et j'ai dû porter des serviettes en papier pour me couvrir les jambes (j'étais en robe, je ne suis pas franchement 'pulpeuse' en plus) et les épaules alors qu'il y avait des mecs en short et en débardeur !! Complètement hallucinant. 
Et puis elles ne sont pas allé agresser des papis et mamies pendant la prière du dimanche, Notre-Dame c'est un lieu surtout touristique.

Greece comes from the Latin name. From wikipedia: 


The names for the nation of Greece and the Greek people differ from the names used in other languages and cultures. Although the Greeks call the country Hellas or Ellada (Greek: Ελλάς or Ελλάδα) and its official name is the Hellenic Republic, in English it is referred to as Greece, which comes from the Latin term Graecia as used by the Romans, which literally means 'the land of the Greeks', and derives from the Greek name Γραικός. However, the name Hellas is sometimes used in English as well.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"The loss of competitiveness was largely thanks to China entering key markets that were previously held by Portuguese manufacturers. This was largely thanks to opening up of the trade with completion of[Multi Fibre Arrangement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Fibre_Arrangement). Let me quote some key points...

&gt; During early 2005, textile and clothing exports from China to the West grew by 100% or more in many items, leading the US and EU to cite China's WTO accession agreement allowing them to restrict the rate of growth to 7.5% per year until 2008. In June, China agreed with the EU to limit the rate to 10% for 3 years. No such agreement was reached with the US, which imposed its own import growth quotas of 7.5% instead.

Not to mention that as price of oil and gas have went continuously up, it has weakened competitiveness of those countries that rely to them. Do remember that Portugal for example doesn't have any nuclear power. The situation was made even worse by Portuguese state giving subsidies to alternative energy producers which have made the energy situation in Portugal even worse. Let me put some figures in here...

Electricity prices per KWH for industrial users

* 0.130 - Germany
* 0.115 - Portugal
* 0.079 - France
* 0.078 - Sweden
* 0.074 - Finland

While Germany as a rich and developed country still has money to pay for sky high electricity prices, still developing economy like Portugal doesn't have that same luxury. They have too high energy prices and there is no devaluation that can turn it around, the only way out of it is to have more sensible energy policies and more competitive energy market.

Portugal, Spain and Greece could very well leave the Euro, but it wouldn't help at all because they still would face increased competition from world markets and suffer from high energy prices. And while you may say that devaluation would help to compete with Chinese, what you have to take into account that Chinese are clear cost leaders, if they need to go even lower, they can do so, if their industries really can't go any lower, the Chinese state can prop them up so long as producers in other countries will go belly-up. Devaluation will not solve anything, it is as good as pissing in your pants in winter, gives you a warm feeling for a few good seconds until you freeze to death.",0,1374157288,null,0,false,0,cb57xnl,t3_1ij2us,t1_cb57xnl,t1_cb55hyl,null,1430423657,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

With private debt, there would need to be new legislation that would allow personal bankruptcies, thus allowing entrepreneurs and risk takers to start again.

But you know how are some people, if they can squeeze money out of you, they will try their best.

1. unified education means bigger countries dictate history interpretation and cultural choices to smaller countries. I've seen it happening in communist Poland and it's ugly. The more points of view - the better for truth.

2. unified army on the other hand seems easy and sensible thing to do, even today, using similar rules to NATO, no need for USE to do that, and defensive capabilities can be much stronger with smaller costs in that way. I support this as long as countries can opt their armies out of partiular offensive operations.

3. unified police seems harmless on the first sight, but I don't see the benefits over current situation (interpol and other coopoeration programs). One drawback I see is - it will be much easier to bribe 1 man dealing with your case and be done with it, than to bribe relevant officers in every country where you perform crimes.

true,diodi,FINL,Finland,"*If it's broken, fix it?*

I think EU is broken in two ways: democratically and economically. 


#Democratically broken

European parliament does not have real power. It's not OK that every time when something really important must be decided, few big regions, like France and Germany, meet and negotiate solution that others must accept or decline. 

# Economically broken

There is this concept called  optimal currency region and eurozone is far from it.  Eurozone fulfills only one criteria:  capital mobility. All other criteria, like labor mobility, price and wage flexibility,  fiscal transfer mechanism, similar business cycles are missing. You could fix it partially if you would create real fiscal union like United States has. 

Euro was economic decision made for political reasons and now the whole EU is in limbo because of it. 

# Solution

You can solve these both problems with either increasing integration or decreasing integration. 

Lack of democracy could be solved by either creating real US of E with **real** parliament, president and whole shebang, or by dropping the parliament and just creating looser union of independent states where state heads make the decisions. 

Economically EU should either take step towards more integration (common fiscal policy) or take step back an reduce integration (drop euro). We have common monetary policy without common fiscal policy. We should choose between common monetary and fiscal policy and separate fiscal and monetary policy and not stand between. 


I think it should be clear that both problems with EU should be solved to the same direction and at the same time. Having political union without fiscal union is not going to work and having fiscal union without good democratic mechanisms and accountability would lead to even more problems in the long run. 

# Personal opinion


It looks like politicians or Europeans in general are not willing to take big steps to either direction. This means that the problems will solve itself by sting of emergencies in the long run and euro will be dropped by many big countries. 

I'm favoring slightly more reducing integration, but I think there would be also merits in unifying EU if doing it right. My biggest worry is in the ""doing it right"" part.

&gt; How did it begin?  
Airi Kivi, founder  
After the Cleaning Day of the Teeme Ära 2008 , the exhausted but happy organisational team came together by the Lake Võrtsjärv for the summer days. We made conclusions and it seemed that nothing that huge will be planned in the near future. But owing to the wonderful companionship and enthusiasm ideas started to evolve until there was no stop to it.  
We had a brainstorming session with the goal of finding exciting new challenges. In no other circumstances could I have dared to express the idea that all people could be happy. For me, this statement has a long history, since I am a psychologist and for years have been training numerous business teams. In the course of analysing communication and management situations, the issue of happiness has come up repetitively. The subject of personal and professional happiness is truly essential for me. Attaining happiness may not be easy. However it is sad to see people making compromises at the cost of personal contentment. Expressing one's wishes and views demands courage and it may not always please others. Nevertheless, a matter that essential should not be left aside.
Back to the summer days... The ideas had been called out and the people started to join groups dependent on which idea seemed attractive. I took a large sheet of writing board paper and waited for the ones interested in the issue of happiness. In a little while, a small group had been formed and together we started to write down keywords associated with happiness.  
Two groups were formed all in all. The idea of the other group evolved later into the next Teeme Ära project. We focused on creating the Bank of Happiness.  
The foundation document of the bank was signed by a large part of the Teeme Ära team and the intensive work period could begin. It is wonderful that the idea of the Bank of Happiness has been so inspiring to a large number of people, as we received letters and cooperation propositions from Estonia as well as from abroad. ""To make all people happy!"" is the vision and the main goal of the Bank of Happiness written down in the foundation document of the Bank.  
We were inspired by the clear understanding that there is a gap in the society between humane caring and economic well-being. We were then and are today convinced that the formula of happiness lies in noticing others. We feel that people want to help others, but often don't know how. On the other hand, we know that there are people who need help in solving their daily problems, but don't know whom to address. This led to the idea to bring these two parties together and to create a website for it.  
The name ""The Bank of Happiness"" gave the structure to the idea. In our eyes, all people can be the clients of the Bank. Everyone could think a little and find something that he or she can do well or is fond of doing. We believe that by dedicating one's personal time it is possible to experience positive emotions. It can be advice on a computer issue, lawn mowing or teaching German. In the Bank of Happiness every good deed is worth one Star of Gratitude or a friendly smile!

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Portugal is going to have a Demographic crisis that is going to be even worse than this. A fertility rate of 1.32 and decreasing. And less and less people will have children if the austerity continues. Almost nobody can afford private childcare and the public childcare is almost not existent.

I very well know that and that actually is also one of the reasons why state needs to employ less people to allow private sector have more people producing goods and services to trade with the world. You can only invest into welfare when you are able to pay it.

&gt; And you aren't saying when the economy will rearrange itself or in what point of the development scale. I have the feeling that the demographics problems, increasing poverty, unemployment, increasingly unskilled labour will make impossible avoid the bankruptcy unless the austerity is applied to levels to are hard to believe even now. And if that's done Portugal will be in the same situation as Romania in 10 years. 

You can compare the situation with the collapse of the Soviet Union and its former Soviet Republics. For example Estonias GDP per capita was 10820 in 1990, it dropped its lowest in 1994 to 8 054, and then started to steadily increase, achieving its Soviet levels in 1997 and in 2008 doubling the GDP compared to 1997/1990.

The good news is that Portugal, Spain and Greece are much more developed and have at least some kind of free markets and currency based economy, thus the rebound should be quicker, if markets are allowed to do their deed.

&gt; And the markets by themselves aren't free. They tend to be dominated by cartels if there isn't state intervention to prevent abuses of dominant position and making easy creating companies. You need legislation, and enforce that legislation for getting free markets.

Well, look where state intervention got these countries, clearly that doesn't work. The only way to fix this situation and quick is to just cut and liberalize legislation and fast.
