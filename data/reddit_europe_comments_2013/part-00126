No, the inaction of your government allowed the ethnic cleansing of Kurds and other minorities.

Hussein ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of Kurds, Assyrians, Jews and other ethnic minorities. During [Al-Anfal Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Anfal_Campaign)*:

* Destroyed about 4,000 villages (out of 4,655) in Iraqi Kurdistan. Between April 1987 and August 1988, 250 towns and villages were exposed to chemical weapons

* Destroyed 1,754 schools, 270 hospitals, 2,450 mosques, 27 churches

* Wiped out around 90% of Kurdish villages in targeted areas

and during the [1991 uprisings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_uprisings_in_Iraq):

another 80.000 - 230.000 undesirable Iraqi citizens were disposed off.

The only reason Hussein's regime survived for so long is that the US government -and their Saudi sponsors- had seen him as a bulwark against the perceived threat posed by Iran's zealous brand of politicized Islam.

This bastard should have been removed from power and tried for crimes against humanity after the first Gulf War in 1990. Dozens thousand lives of Shia Iraqis would have been preserved.

China started in 1978, just leaving a power struggle after Mao's death in 1976, and just having wiped out a big part of the country's educated people, schools, university and knowledge during ten years of ""Cultural Revolution"". India started in 1991 with its educational system and educated class intact.

&gt;No, the inaction of your government allowed the ethnic cleansing of Kurds and other minorities.

&gt;Hussein ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of Kurds, Assyrians, Jews and other ethnic minorities. During [Al-Anfal Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Anfal_Campaign)*:

&gt;* Destroyed about 4,000 villages (out of 4,655) in Iraqi Kurdistan. Between April 1987 and August 1988, 250 towns and villages were exposed to chemical weapons

&gt;* Destroyed 1,754 schools, 270 hospitals, 2,450 mosques, 27 churches

&gt;* Wiped out around 90% of Kurdish villages in targeted areas

&gt;and during the [1991 uprisings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_uprisings_in_Iraq):

&gt;another 80.000 - 230.000 undesirable Iraqi citizens were disposed off.

&gt;The only reason Hussein's regime survived for so long is that the US government -and their Saudi sponsors- had seen him as a bulwark against the perceived threat posed by Iran's zealous brand of politicized Islam.

&gt;This bastard should have been removed from power and tried for crimes against humanity after the first Gulf War in 1990. Dozens thousand lives of Shia Iraqis would have been preserved.

&gt;*the Al-Anfal campaign is recognized by the governments of UK, Norway and Sweden as ethnic genocide.

And then went on to commit further genocide against the Iraqi people. You seriously think that western leaders give a flying fuck about some brown people in a far off land. More fool you..

Lets be crystal clear here, the US ordered this report into the Iraqi water supplies 

http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/declassdocs/dia/19950901/950901_511rept_91.html

27. IRAQ WILL SUFFER INCREASING SHORTAGES OF PURIFIED WATER BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF REOUIRED CHEMICALS AND DESALINIZATION MEMBRANES. INCIDENCES OF DISEASE, INCLUDING POSSIBLE EPIDEMICS,WILL BECOME PROBABLE UNLESS THE POPULATION WERE CAREFUL TO BOIL WATER BEFORE CONSUMPTION, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM, NEVER A HIGH PRIORITY, WILL SUFFER THE SAME LOSS OF CAPABILITY WITH THE LACK OF CHLORINE. LOCALLY PRODUCED FOOD AND MEDICINE COULD BE CONTAMINATED.

Now if you were to have received that report and cared in the slightest about Iraqis: sunnis, kurds or shia you might think placing an embargo on water treatment supplies would harm the population causing epidemics of mass illness, suffering and mass death. But we went ahead and did it anyway. 

It can't be described as anything other than a deliberate and intended act of genocide. 

Also the US sold him those chemical weapons under the Carter regime and when he was using chemical weapons on the kurds the US prevented the issue from being raised at the un security council. Now you dont have to take my word for that,

Simple example: (Scottish) Gaelic is a language[1], but it doesn't have an army. Furthermore, nobody in their right minds would call British English, American English, and Australian English different languages, yet they have independent armies!

Linguistically, a common way of distinguishing languages from dialects is the degree of [mutual intelligibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility), and [dialectometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectometry) is a thing, too. This should drive the point home that the difference between language and dialect is not a clear-cut one (which is why it is so easy to misuse it for political gains.)

A lot of US peanut butters have similar issues, but unlike here, at least there are many excellent ones as well.

Most of the Dutch Pindakaas doesn't have that problem and they simply taste a lot more ""natural"", maybe that's the reason why the Asia stores stock it here.

You may want to re-evaluate your Calvé Pindakaas by the way. It's a Unilever product and they ""improved"" the recipe by reducing the amount of peanuts from an outstanding 93% to a ludicrous 85% in 2009 (and I believe they never changed back, but I haven't had the chance to check in a long time) - the rest is cheap vegetable oil.

As the author of the comic is [an American](http://warmfuzzyglow.com/my-new-project-a-webcomic-about-finland-10257/), I'd be surprised if he has ever even heard of True Finns party, or has a chip on his shoulder.

&gt; As a Swede, I wonder where all all this resentment is coming from.

Recently maybe just our language dispute overspilling. There is an opposition to the compulsory Swedish at schools. And some leave no stone unturned to dig some dirt to fling aroud whether it's relevant to the compulsory Swedish or not. Now, I don't know how it gets reported in Sweden, but perhaps there's a tendency to sensationalize at least in the headlines I've seen.

&gt; The truth is that Finland was never treated as a colony of Sweden. It was a part of Sweden, and treated just like any other province of the realm, quite unlike the narrative in this comic.

During our 600 years together we had our ups and downs. Personally I respect, and love our long common history, but also recognize that it is open to different narratives some closer to 'truth' than others. All in all, I see that the long period as a part of Sweden had a positive impact on Finland and it's future. And some of the Swedish kings are fondly remembered in Finland.

Then again. 1809. Russia easily conquers Finland. Achievement unlocked: Instant Autonomy! :)

Anyway, here's to our common history and glory days!

http://ugotujmnie.blox.pl/resource/pierog1.jpg

Recipe:

 - flour 0.75 kg,
 - hot water,
 - salt,
 - egg,
 - 3 spoons of oil,
 - blueberries (best freshly gathered in forest),
 - sugar (as much to cover the berries completly),
 - cream (or yoghurt).

Pour 0.5 spoon of salt and 3 spoons of oil into the flour, then put the hot water into it. Mix with spoon or something (to not burn your hands). When it's lukewarm - work the dough with hands.

Form circular pieces of dough (some use glass to cut the dough, some prefer bigger circles), put some berries with sugar into each and close them to form the pieróg shape. Carefully close the edge.

Throw the pierogi into the boiling water (not too big fire, just enough to keep the water boiling, otherwise the pierogi will break). Boil for +- 5 minutes after the pierogi float on the surface.

Serve with sour cream or sugar.

Not how the law works, nor how it should work.

That a war was fought for resources in way undermines the humanitarian component of it. I can happily argue that we shouldn't have fought it for oil and yet that it war worth fighting to remove Saddam without contradicting myself. 

The UN is not a law making body, and at any rate, the US have never pretended to comply with their directives when it comes to foreign intervention. The fails of the UN are widespread because of the inclusion of numerous backward and authoritarian regimes, China and Russia not being the least of them. Their indecision over Iraq in way implied it wasn't correct to enter the region, much as their prevarication over Syria now does not undermine intervention.

* A City Council member in Padua, belonging to the anti-immigration party Northern League, called for Ms. Kyenge, the Congolese-born minister of integration, to be raped so that she could “understand” what victims felt. The councilor, Dolores Valandro, made the comment in a discussion about a woman said to have been raped by an African man.

* The government is pondering whether increasing the VAT tax from 21% to 22%, giving execution to a law introduced by the previous Monti government. Berlusconi's party, that is part of the government, is very vocal against any increase in taxes and it is threatening the survival of the government itself in case the VAT rate is increased.

Put it this way, before I was 14 I had never ever broken a bone. I could not imagine breaking a bone. To me, it seemed like the most immeasurably painful think possible, because I had heard it was very painful and knew I had never done anything that painful. I was scared of it happening (not terrified, but you know) and so on. Then, I was playing football and suddenly my wrist was broken. Ok, it was pretty bad and I was in a lot of pain, but then I went to the doctor's and got a splint. It was quite painful for a few weeks and then I was fixed. And I can't for the life of me remember why I was so worried. I mean, I'm in no hurry to break my arm again, but I know that I could get by quite easily if it happened. I'm also much more ok with the idea of more intense painful experiences because I know I can manage. 

Moving to an EU country is quite similar. Before you go, it's terrifying. It's literally unimaginable. But then, if you have that ounce of determination, you go and you struggle and you get by and it is fantastic. You open your world and you set your standards higher. All of a sudden you can look at yourself and say ""I did something"". I just moved to somewhere with a different language and a different culture that I did not know and then I thrived. You'll have a group of friends you would never be able to have before hand and you might even speak a bit of a second language. Whether you decide to move back to England or stay on the Continent, that will look very good to an employer and just be a great experience.

This is different. Braveheart didn't have just the English as antagonists. It also did not portray the English as evil one dimensional characters.

The UK will almost certainly retain its name. Nothing about the UK itself will change apart from that its sovereign territory will become dramatically smaller. All UK laws will remain the same and the UK's membership to new clubs will remain the same. It's just that a chunk of the UK will then be missing.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I'm not talking about absolute truth. The way people are portrayed on TV influences our views of them. It creates stereotypes. Russians are drunkards, Romanians are thieves, Polish people are lazy etc. 

So, start doing good movies that portrays Russians as hardworking, Romanian as cultured, Arabs as peace loving or whatever, but stop whing. If you *do* look at movies you will know that *everyone* gets mistreated - the whole time. I'd guess the Americans and Indians less than most, just because they own a lot of the film industry, but who knows, I am not a movie buff, I am sure they are portrayed as pure evil in some films. 

However, whining is just unattractive. Stop whining and make fabulous movies/TV shows etc then that changes peoples perspective. Whining isn't doing that. 



&gt;So? The Poles should whine. WW2 is relatively recent history. 

Oh - can you tell me exactly which portrayes that are OK to do and not, of all the worlds nations. And which conflicts that is OK to butcher, and not, in the world. I am bloody sure that the Middle East would not like to exclude everything before 1939. For them it is recent, also because they live with consequences of what went before -every single person in the world does that you see. So, there is not ""we can do this but not that"", it is more whether people can take it or if they are whiners. I know which category the Poles are.

No one likes, or admires, or, what is more important, even listens to a whiner. What I have taken with me that is that Poles want special treatment and are whiners. 

Besides, the whole argument that it is recent is stupid. Before you claimed that it was the impression you cared about - do you think the Brits like being portrayed as lying murderers in several movies. That forms an impression - at least you said so. Or, Russians, or  - well, frankly any natinality that are incorrectly portrayed, which means every single one - but only the Poles  whine.

You see, in the adult world, we know that a) there is a freedom of speech that means people can say, write etc a lot of things that I do not like b) we know that we will not like everything c) we are also aware of that most movies and tv shows are shitty, and the historical ones are not correct d) we also have the ability to *turn off* the tv when things are not to our liking, instead of whining like cry babies 

Oh, and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qbyyk/what_movie_would_you_say_most_screwed_up_the/)is a list from AskHistorians about shitty movies. etc. [Another link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/movies#wiki_historical_accuracy_in_movies) Just a few of course, but you will notice that most of the fiction mentioned has not rendered that grown up people/nations whine (it seems like the whole bloody nation whines) they just notice it is bad and move on - you see, adults do that. In fact, the rest of us don't make threads and whine. 


So, the impression I have of Poles is not of the tv show, which I incidently haven't seen, but of how they behave when they don't like how they are portrayed - and that it is not very flattering. They seem to be a nation of whiners who unlike everyone else is incapable of behaving like adults, letting go and moving on. Whine, whine, whine. Buhuuu, there was a tv show made that didn't portray history in the way I like, I am whining, crying - frankly, I am sure they are at home stomping their foot.

true,Fellowsparrow,null,null,"Merci d'avoir pris le temps de répondre à mes remarques. Je vais maintenant t'infliger un nouveau pavé en reprenant tes arguments.

&gt;Déjà il y en a beaucoup : pétitions, lettres à ton député, vote, débat télévisuel, articles sur journal papier, radio, affiches.

Tous ces moyens de contribution au débat démocratique ont été utilisés par les participants à la Manif pour tous et les opposants au mariage gay, mis à part le vote (puisqu'il n'y a pas encore eu d'élection sur le sujet et finalement pas de référendum). 

Mais ce qui a un vrai pouvoir d'influence sur un gouvernement, ce sont les manifestations. C'est ce qui a conduit de très nombreuses fois un gouvernement à retirer son projet de loi. Tu sais sans doute que la Manif pour tous se base sur le modèle de la manifestation de 1984 contre [le projet de loi Savary](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projet_de_loi_Savary), à une époque où l'enseignement privé était sérieusement menacé. La manifestation finale à Paris avait mobilisé entre 850 000 (selon la police) et deux millions de personnes (selon les manifestants): autant dire que le gouvernement de Mitterrand a aussitôt fait machine arrière. Cela reste aujourd'hui l'une des plus grosses manifs de l'histoire de la Vème République.

On remarquera au passage que lors d'une manif classique, les médias présentent souvent cela comme le signe d'une démocratie en bonne santé, avec un peuple qui lutte contre l'autoritarisme / la mondialisation / la précarisation (selon les causes défendues). Mais la Manif pour tous a simplement été présentée comme l'action de réactionnaires infâmes qui n'arrivent pas à accepter que la gauche soit au pouvoir, comme si cette manifestation se situait en dehors de tout cadre démocratique.

Je continue à insister sur le fait que la manifestation reste absolument légitime, et influence les démocraties de façon fondamentale (je pense à des dizaines de projets de loi français qui ont été avortés, sous les hourras de l'opinion publique, mais aussi à l'actualité internationale). A condition bien sûr que la violence reste en dessous d'un seuil acceptable.

&gt;Je cite : ""il va y avoir du sang"" ou encore un appel au ""Printemps français"", Bartolone qui recoit des courriers avec de la poudre... Bref le climat n'est pas trop au dialogue.

Le ""Hollande veut du sang, il en aura !"" de Barjot peut être interprété de pas mal de façons, surtout qu'il est suivi par ""Le président de la République a décidé de nous guillotiner. Si ce soir il fuse des 'Hollande démission', contrairement aux autres fois, je n'empêcherais pas les slogans"".

Bajot réagissait à l'annonce de l'accélération de la procédure parlementaire du vote de la loi. On peut se demander de quel sang parle Barjot (peut-être de celui des manifestants qui se feraient ""charcuter"" par Hollande) et on remarque que la conséquence la plus grave à laquelle pense Barjot est la démission du président.

Le mouvement du ""Printemps français"" est aussi vague qu'excessif. Sans être Madame Irma, je ne lui prédis pas un grand avenir. Le mieux (et le pire) qu'il puisse leur arriver est de se faire avaler par l'extrême-droite, ce qui amoindrirait considérablement son pouvoir fédérateur qui n'est déjà pas bien élevé.  

Quant à Bartolone qui reçoit de la poudre, c'est aussi choquant qu'anecdotique. Erwann Binet (député socialiste rapporteur de la loi) et Frigide Barjot ont reçu autant de menaces de mort l'un que l'autre, et ce de façon quotidienne.

&gt;Oh mais pas qu'elle, Boutin, Copé. J'oserai même dire que l'autre bord s'en sert aussi (pour cacher les autres problèmes). Les seuls a être motivé par la problématique de société ca semble être tout le monde sauf eux.

Cette opposition au mariage homosexuel, c'est le fond de commerce de Boutin depuis des décennies. Elle s'est positionnée politiquement là-dessus (ainsi que sur des sujets comme l'avortement ou l'euthanasie) parce que c'est son combat depuis les origines de son parti. Cela coulait donc de source qu'elle s'empare du sujet. Quant à Copé et à l'UMP, ils courent derrière la Manif pour tous sans réussir à les rattraper. Seuls quelques individus comme Henri Guaino ou Hevé Mariton ont pris le sujet à bras-le-corps et sont un peu écoutés par les manifestants. Même Marine Le Pen reste prudente, car elle sait qu'une part non négligeable de son électorat est homosexuelle.

On est bien d'accord que la gauche a lancé cette loi pour masquer ses échecs en pleine crise économique: on n'arrive pas à proposer du neuf dans le domaine économique et social, donc on se lance dans le sociétal, théoriquement moins coûteux (même si les socialistes sortent maintenant épuisés de la confrontation avec les manifestants). 

&gt;Parlons en au contraire: ""violence et port d'arme prohibées"" par exemple. Ca ne me semble pas ridicule comme motif.

Peux-tu me filer un lien vers ce cas précis ? Il est tout à fait possible que ça ait eu lieu, mais j'aimerai en savoir plus. J'estime quand à moi que le niveau de violence lors de ces manifestations est resté tout à fait acceptable. Aucune voiture brûlée, aucune dégradation de biens publics ou privés, c'est quand même impressionnant pour des manifs qui regroupent 400 000 personnes. Surtout quand on sait qu'il y a régulièrement des bandes de casseurs dans les manifestations (quelque soient les revendications des manifestants).

On peut également constater qu'on a 200 ou 300 personnes qui affrontent les CRS lors des dernières manifs: par rapport au total des manifestants pacifiques, je te laisse faire le calcul du pourcentage que ça représente. Même Manuel Valls a estimé qu'il s'agissait de dérives qui sont inévitables dans n'importe quelle manifestation de grande ampleur.

Si maintenant on se met à recenser toutes les fois où des jeunes se sont fait arrêter pour avoir porté le sweat de la Manif pour tous, on se dit que la police a pas mal dérapé. Il est assez facile de se procurer sur Internet des récits de garde à vue où des jeunes cathos propres sur eux subissent une garde à vue de vingt quatre heures ou plus parce qu'ils ont mis un peu trop de temps à se disperser à la fin de la manif... Devant des responsables de commissariat médusés qui ne voient pas très bien pourquoi ils sont là, et des agents de police qui ont toutes les peines du monde à trouver un motif officiel d'arrestation.

&gt;Oui, par leurs évêques (André 23?). Personnellement je préfère ma république séculaire, merci bien.

Le troupeau de moutons catholiques qui suivent docilement leur évêque, c'est plus un cliché qu'autre chose. Le Conseil des évêques de France a été assez actif dans le débat sur le mariage homosexuel, mais de là à considérer qu'ils tirent les ficelles... Par ailleurs, ""République séculaire"" ne signifie pas que l'Eglise catholique française soit tenue par la loi de ne pas s'exprimer dans l'espace public: la laïcité n'est pas la censure.

A part ça, tu as fait l'erreur habituelle de coller un numéro à l'archevêque de Paris: son nom de famille est Vingt-Trois, ce n'est pas un ordre de succession. L'archevêque de Paris n'est pas le pape ;)

&gt;Merci pour le lien, mais ils parlent de la PMA séparément de la problématique du mariage pour tous. Je suis donc assez content de ça :).

On n'a pas dû écouter la même émission ;).

Je te cite les cinq dernières minutes de l'émission.

&gt; **Journaliste**: -Vous écrivez d'ailleurs, Thibaut Colin, ""l'ouverture du mariage civil dispose les mentalités à légitimer le dispositif des mères porteuses"". Autrement dit, quand on était pour le mariage pour tous, sans le savoir peut-être, on était forcément, en tout cas logiquement, pour la GPA ?

&gt;**Thibaut Colin**: -Logiquement ! Beaucoup de gens ont fait la distinction, mais effectivement, à partir du moment où on valide certains principes [le mariage homosexuel], on peut subjectivement et volontairement s'arrêter là. Mais le fait est que les choses se déploient, et le plus souvent d'ailleurs, ces gens qui s'étaient arrêtés à tel endroit en disant 'Moi, j'irais pas plus loin', finalement, comme ils n'ont pas d'argument de fond ou ne perçoivent pas forcément les enjeux, finissent par être d'accord. Et c'est effectivement l'importance de la loi qui finit par légitimer des pratiques qui, me semble-t-il, posent de vrais problèmes éthiques.

&gt;**Dominique Mehl**: -Juste un petit point sur la gestation pour autrui: ça n'a pas été débattu, ça a été présenté comme un épouvantail, ou bien comme un argument tactique pour les défenseurs du mariage pour tous, en disant 'Nous, de toute façon, on a une revendication d'égalité, les couples hétérosexuels n'y ayant pas accès, la question ne se pose pas'. **C'est un peu hypocrite**, parce que la question se pose, y compris pour les couples hétérosexuels, d'ailleurs.

&gt;**Journaliste**: -Donc vous donnez raison finalement aux opposants au mariage pour tous qui disaient 'C'est la porte ouverte à la GPA'.

&gt;**Dominique Mehl**: -Oui, c'est dans la logique, absolument, absolument ! Là je suis absolument d'accord. Je ne sais pas quand le politique le fera, s'il est prêt à le faire, mais sociétalement, on entre dans une période où tout ça peut se concevoir, se penser et même éventuellement se mettre en pratique si c'est autorisé.

Petit rappel: Thibaut Colin est opposé au mariage, à la procréation assistée et à la GPA pour les homosexuels. Dominique Mehl y est favorable. Tu remarqueras que dans ce passage, tous deux ne parlent pas de la PMA mais de la GPA, qui est généralement considérée comme étant encore moins probable d'être légalisée que la PMA. Pourtant, ils estiment que séparer les deux dossiers est absurde.

Au cas où il y aurait un malentendu là-dessus, je rappelle que la Manif pour tous n'a jamais prétendu que la PMA ou la GPA étaient contenues dans la loi qui a été votée. Mais ils ont répété que cette loi était un pas de plus vers la légalisation de la procréation pour les couples homosexuels, ce qu'on peut difficilement ignorer. Et comme l'explique Colin, cette loi commence déjà à enclencher un processus de légitimation (à défaut de légalisation) de la PMA ou GPA pour les personnes homosexuelles.

Enfin, [ce lien]( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/apres-le-mariage-pour-tous-que-vont-devenir-les-autres-reformes-societales_311499.html) que je t'ai déjà passé montre assez bien que pour beaucoup d'élus français ou de responsables d'associations homosexuelles, le ""mariage pour tous"" et la légalisation de la PMA sont naturellement liés. Ils considèrent même que la loi qui a été votée n'est qu'une demi-réussite: il manque la dernière pièce du puzzle, à savoir la PMA.

Là réside notre principal désaccord: tu estimes qu'évoquer la PMA et GPA lors du débat sur le mariage homosexuel, c'est ""camoufler"" le débat. Moi, j'estime au contraire que c'est aller au fond du problème. 

Si j'étais une lesbienne militante dans une association LGBT, tu ne me verrais certainement pas en train de justifier les actions de la Manif pour tous, mais tu verrais probablement les mêmes arguments sur le fait que les deux aspects (légalisation du mariage homosexuel et légalisation de la procréation homosexuelle) sont fondamentalement liés.",0,1371999020,null,0,1372013508,0,caokxfz,t3_1gq3kh,t1_caokxfz,t1_cao5rsl,null,1430711871,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

The FSK has the following rating:

FSK 0: For children. No dark stuff at all because apparently, small children have problems with dealing with this stuff.

FSK 6: Same as FSK 0 but with dark plots. Seems like 6 years old children have the possibility to distance themselves better from such things.

FSK 12: Most of the stuff that would be broadcast at 8 pm is FSK 12. Minor violence, nudity (American Pie is FSK 12), no drugs or alcohol or stuff like that

FSK 16: Everything except nudity that is there for the sake of nudity (so no full frontal spread legs not simulated sex scenes) and you won't find extreme racism, drug using, political extremism.

FSK 18: Everything that doesn't break any laws (like our anti propaganda laws or stuff like that).

For games and such, it looks similar. I think I'll have an easier time giving examples here.

USK 0: Family games like Mario or stuff like that. But also games that wouldn't harm a child but are not playable by a child younger than 6. Like simulators or RPGs.

USK 6: Family cames with competition. Like Mario Kart for example. Also, more complex game play and higher difficulty.

USK 12: Combat focused games that allow keeping distance. Even military stuff like Hearts of Iron is USK 12. World of Warcraft is probably the most famous example. The fantasy setting allows, according to the USK, to keep distance to the game.

USK 16: Stuff like ""The Witcher 2"" was USK 16. So nudity (if it's not a porn game), violence and so on.

USK 18: Everything that doesn't break any laws. Also, killing innocent people can't be helpful. So in the German version of Saints Row 3rd, you couldn't take civilians as a shield. Obviously, it can't break any laws which it does more often than in films.

&gt; give it to Obama it was not for his words alone!

If not his words, and not his actions, then what?  His campaign slogan?

&gt; Unlike your typical American prizes for achievements, this prize was
&gt; given to encourage and with hope that it could affect future outcomes.
&gt; Other Nobel laurates have seen doors ""open"", and felt a need to act
&gt; accordingly [as written in their biographies]. Giving them momentum, a
&gt; moral burden and hopefully respect from their opponents.

Past winners have actually accomplished something other than winning a demagogic popularity contest.  I've not read of any past winners feeling a moral duty to the prize, but even if I take your word for it, that's a ridiculous justification.

Why not award one to every person on the planet, then, if you're so confident in its mystical ability to make laureates peaceful?

What you forget is that every laureate who fools you into awarding one based on oratorical cruft and not tangible action dilutes the significance of the award.  And to award one to a man who *already professed* all the ideals you wish to instil in him makes your reasoning all the more absurd.

Rewarding a prize to a man on those terms makes a mockery of him *and* you, and lessens the impact of all future prizes.

&gt; It was by no means a sure thing, it was a long shot. It was also meant
&gt; to reward the proper democratic process in the US (see Bush-Gore);
&gt; and the first half-black President was worth noting.

Bush v Gore *was* the proper democratic process.  What better outcome could be expected than a *split decision*, by the nations *highest court*, when deciding between candidates for the *most powerful position on the planet*, with only ~*500 votes* separating them?

If ever there were going to be a moment in modern history where liberalism falters under the immense strain of powerful men vying for supremacy, that was it.  Yet it didn't.  The court was free to bicker between themselves, there was no show trial.  The media broadcast every moment, and spent the next year analyzing every detail.  Even retired justices second guessed their own opinions a decade later.

true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"&gt;So, start doing good movies that portrays Russians as hardworking, Romanian as cultured, Arabs as peace loving or whatever, but stop whing. If you do look at movies you will know that everyone gets mistreated - the whole time. I'd guess the Americans and Indians less than most, just because they own a lot of the film industry, but who knows, I am not a movie buff, I am sure they are portrayed as pure evil in some films. 

How else would you get the message across to filmmakers that their portrayal is wrong? This isn't whining, it's criticism and criticism should always be welcomed.

&gt;However, whining is just unattractive. Stop whining and make fabulous movies/TV shows etc then that changes peoples perspective. Whining isn't doing that. 

Not everyone has the financial possibilities to create movies and TV shows. You're being unreasonable.

&gt;Oh - can you tell me exactly which portrayes that are OK to do and not, of all the worlds nations. And which conflicts that is OK to butcher, and not, in the world. I am bloody sure that the Middle East would not like to exclude everything before 1939. For them it is recent, also because they live with consequences of what went before -every single person in the world does that you see. So, there is not ""we can do this but not that"", it is more whether people can take it or if they are whiners. I know which category the Poles are.

You seem to hate Polish people quite a bit. Why is that? Have they done something to you?

&gt;No one likes, or admires, or, what is more important, even listens to a whiner. What I have taken with me that is that Poles want special treatment and are whiners. 

So do the Jews it seems. No one would even dream of making a movie that portays the Holocaust as anything but the horrible event it was.

&gt;Besides, the whole argument that it is recent is stupid. Before you claimed that it was the impression you cared about - do you think the Brits like being portrayed as lying murderers in several movies. That forms an impression - at least you said so. Or, Russians, or - well, frankly any natinality that are incorrectly portrayed, which means every single one - but only the Poles whine.

There are numerous movies out there that show British people in a positive manner. 

&gt;You see, in the adult world, we know that a) there is a freedom of speech that means people can say, write etc a lot of things that I do not like b) we know that we will not like everything c) we are also aware of that most movies and tv shows are shitty, and the historical ones are not correct d) we also have the ability to turn off the tv when things are not to our liking, instead of whining like cry babies 

I'm not saying this series should be banned. What I **am** saying is that the opposition towards it shouldn't be discouraged. Free speech goes both ways. 

&gt;So, the impression I have of Poles is not of the tv show, which I incidently haven't seen, but of how they behave when they don't like how they are portrayed - and that it is not very flattering.

God forbid they criticise something that portays them in an undeserved negative manner!

&gt;They seem to be a nation of whiners who unlike everyone else is incapable of behaving like adults, letting go and moving on.

Are you racist? I'm asking because it seems to me like you hate the Poles more than anything in this world. 

&gt;Whine, whine, whine. Buhuuu, there was a tv show made that didn't portray history in the way I like, I am whining, crying - frankly, I am sure they are at home stomping their foot. Good impression they are making, really.

Of course :-). I am not saying that they don't deserve it either. 

I know, and I am sure you know too that a lot of the portrayals in films  (I'd say most) are wrong. What a historical movie does for me is either pure brain dead entertainment - I mean, I don't see Braveheart as a lot more correct or filled with facts than Alien or Lord of the Rings.

Or, a historical movie can provide me with some insight to the era, but more like waking an interest. I know Band of Brothers has it faults, but it did get me started on reading up on the D-day landings. I am currently reading Tom Hollands ""Rubicon"", and I thank Colleen McCoullough series about Caesar and the late Roman Republic for that  - and I still enjoy Gladiator, with it gazillion mistakes. 

I guess I just want to say that most of us know that life is not like fiction, we are aware of that. And, freedom of speech also makes it important that people can say, write, and portray things we don't agree with. The best way to deal with it in my opinion is ignore it.  One can not, nor should one, try to control fiction. It would be very,  very dangerous.

England also took bits of Ireland, then in 1603, King James IV of Scotland inherited the Kingdom of England from Elizabeth I. He wanted to unite the two Kingdoms officially, making it Great Britain, but neither the English nor the Scottish wanted it, so he remained both the King of England and the King of Scotland.

Fast forward past a few shit monarchs, a few good ones, a civil war and a republic, and we get to 1707 and the Act of Union, where the English and Scottish parliaments, who at that point were separate but with the same monarch (Queen Ann) agreed to become one, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain.

You can find other pictures by typing in ""Tara"" or ""Zlatibor"" into Google. Generally that area is touristic but only tourists from Serbia go there so it's not at all flooded, prices are very cheap (rafting etc.). One of those rivers (not sure which, Tara perhaps) is flowing through a tectonic break so it's like 500m deep.

The locals are generally very friendly but perhaps not everyone will speak English.

Another 2-3 day trip would be [Djerdap](http://www.srbija.travel/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/djerdap_golubac.jpg), that's the Danube bordering Serbia and Romania and the national park stretches from Golubac to Donji Milanovac.

This morning in the town of Laç, One was killed and 1 was wounded in an argument that, according to Albanian TV news, started some days ago over the hanging of political posters. It was a gun battle and the person who did the killing was the vice mayor (with democratic party) of Laç. The person killed was a member of LSI, part of the Socialist opposition coaliton.

Jesus christ. That's a bit unsafe.

&gt;However you should know that the city of Laç is not at all representative of the rest of the country. In fact, Laç is known for gun violence and violence in general. This reputation goes back even to the “time of Hoxha” or when the Stalinist government was running Albania.

&gt;Laç is also known for being fiercely Catholic, defending their church during communism from the most atheist government the world has ever known.

Also you forget that privacy concerns in Germany are exceptionally high (compared to the rest of the world). E.G.: Every database has to be used for it's intended reason and for that reason only, exceptions are court orders, so abuse is less likely (though I can't say it is impossible)

And Germany still, as one of the only EU countries (if not THE only), still doesn't have the collection of every internet connection for 6 or so months. We had one but that was shelved by our constitutional court. 

Their reason was that if you treat every citizen like a potentional criminal, then that speaks of a severly disturbed relationship between government and population, a relationship which has no place in a democracy. We don't have a new (constitution friendly) law for that now, so Germany could face a fine from the EU of 100 Mio €... per day! (fuck you too, EU!)

* Our minister for internal affairs said that electronic voting will come to Slovenia soon, there will be a trial done on some local elections, to see how its going.

* Parliament agreed on some cuts to some of the ministries. Some ministers are already complaining about it.

* Our defence minister will fly to some visit with our state plane. The problem is we got the plane years ago, it was bought for no apparent reason, people got angry, then it was put on sale, was rented out, now it was waiting in hangar for some time. People are upset, because they say it would be cheaper flying with some airline, minister says it's cheaper his way. If nobody wants to buy it, then let them fly it.

* Our former PM, now convicted for crimes, is again mouthing off about comunism and shit and stuff. He also didn't want to shut up about some other stuff but who carres about his stupid ugly assholeface. Shut the fuck up you fucking criminal asshole. Go to the fucking jail already and suck some cock.

* Some guy killed his girlfriend and then himself. The problem is, she was employed in a kindergarden and he killed her on the parking loft of the kindergarden. Again some people were upset.

* Our biggest store Merkator is being sold to Croatian store Agrokor. People are upset because we might lose jobs, local agricultur producers might lose buisness, Croatian products might overflow our market. And there are allegations that our current PM might be involved into the sale, but she says she's not. Apparently 70% of Slovenians are against selling Merkator to a croatia company.

* Parliament agreed on selling 15 state companies. We needs ze money. Fucking bankers and fucking stupid pricks that stole from us.

* There is plenty of heavy traffic everywhere. Especially on roads that lead to the sea or Croatia. 

* Our banks have created 41 millions of loss in first 4 months of this year.

* our GDP is falling. 

* A guy who was managing one of our biggest constuction companies, destroyed it, was then charged and convicted for bribery, and doesn't want to go to jail and wants to do comunity service insted, we found out that he paid out almost 9 million euros out of his falling company and hid it.

i missed last weeks topic.

A kid who tried to go to Syria to fight but allegedly only made it to turkey returned to Belgium, was detained by police for a while but allowed to go home afterwards. So future Belgian terrorists if the police start questioning you say you never made it to the place you were meant to kill maim and rape. (3 other kids were stopped at the Turkish syrian border and returned home too)

kinda pissed me off so I added it to this week.

Our current King (Albert II) had an affair decades ago and had allegedly had a child. the now woman wants to be recognized as a child of the king and demanded a dna test.
This is getting quite a bit of attention in the media.

Our minister of immigration pushed trough some reforms resulting in her needing less money so she returned 90 million to the government that is looking for an extra half a billion. Reading trough comments on social media and paper websites show how little my fellow Belgians know about how departments get funded.

Both Cristian democrat parties in the country are pissed they weren't consulted by the other parties when they decided they were going to vote positively when they were going to vote to allow euthanasia for terminally ill children. 

Coming Wednesday is the final day you can turn in your 2012 tax forms if you aren't doing it online. Today wasn't that beautiful a day and it was a boring sunday so everyone tried to use the online version which subsequently crashed.

We got a new American ambassador, the old one was caught up in an affair.

Our prince Laurent ( the nice and popular one, not the one that is going to become king) got caught up in an other scandal when he went to Israel to celebrate a good cause that tries to return some forests to the nation.

This being Belgium I bet you were expecting something that makes you loose faith in humanity, I will not disappoint you. a preschool was shutdown this week after some parents found their kids showed signs of molestation. 

A law was suggested and denied that would make the consumption and sale of alcohol to illegal for kids under 18.

and the usual squabbling between the communities, for some reason 6 billion extra was going from the north to the south and a train that has no travelers in the north has to be canceled and because of that one in the south needed to be shutdown too.

Then I dropped down to pass and it was so unbelievably easy by comparison that I lost all focus (other subjects were pretty difficult) and interest and never regained it since.

This reform met with strong opposition from the upper and middle classes who at the time were mostly French speaking.

true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"&gt;I know, and I am sure you know too that a lot of the portrayals in films (I'd say most) are wrong. What a historical movie does for me is either pure brain dead entertainment - I mean, I don't see Braveheart as a lot more correct or filled with facts than Alien or Lord of the Rings.

The difference here is that this portrayal is not just wrong but it actively demonizes a nation whilst glorifying one of the most brutal regimes in Europe. 

If somebody portrays the Jews as money grubbing bastards and Hitler as the saviour of the German nation you would rightfully get up in arms. Why shouldn't the Poles do the same when their own ethnicity is portrayed the way it is? 

&gt;I guess I just want to say that most of us know that life is not like fiction, we are aware of that.

Unfortunately, these things have a tendency to subtly influence people's opinions. 

&gt;And, freedom of speech also makes it important that people can say, write, and portray things we don't agree with. 

Free speech goes both ways. You have the right to say whatever you want and I have the right to criticise you if I disagree.

&gt;The best way to deal with it in my opinion is ignore it. One can not, nor should one, try to control fiction. It would be very, very dangerous. 

This isn't about trying to control fiction. 

&gt;I honestly hope there are a lot of good Eastern European movies and tv shows coming, that show everything from Eastern European history, to just ordinary lives- just good movies. I don't know if we have any really either. I think Sweden is more known for pop music. 

Hopefully. Every single portrayal of Eastern Europe in the media has been negative and because people adopted an attitude of indifference the most common belief regarding Eastern Europe is that it's a complete shithole.

true,IdenPoelchau,null,null,"Hihi, rosetta, that one cracks me up every time I read it - reminds me of the Rosette :-P

I compiled this list about what to expect in Germany / Europe once...

* drinking isn't socially akward in Germany. You can drink Beer and Wine from the age of 16. Harder stuff like Vodka, Rum or Schnaps from the age of 18. And yeah, people drink publicly, and we have 'Fest' (parties) just for the reason of drinking.

* yes, on some parts of the Autobahn there are no speedlimits. There are some very funny videos of american exchangestudents driving on it... and screaming a lot. Tho Germans are used to it, and it takes far more to get a driver license in Germany than in the States. (You need to be 18 to drive in Germany tho)

* waiters don't come to your table in Europe in general to check how you are faring every 5 minutes. You just wave at them if you need something, or they come by on their own if they see that you are done eating etc.

* Europe, and especially Germany, are very open about sex, compared to the US. However we censor violence in movies far more than you guys do.

* you don't need to speak German, almost everybody does speak english on some level. So if you don't care too much about the grammar, spelling or ze th, you should be fine. If you try to learn German, your best bet is to pretend you don't speak english at all tho. Since most Germans, not out of rudness, will speak in english to you, if you try to speak in broken German. (The French and Spanish are the other way around. They only like you if you try to speak a little of their language).
(Specially for your case: Saxony has a very, very hard accent.. I doubt you'll find it easy to learn German there. You should ask people to talk 'High German' (Hochdeutsch) with you. That would make it far easier for you).

* public restroomes usually cost a small fee (ca. 50 Cent) to enter

* it is uncommon to order tab water in restaurants and there usually is gas in water (carbonized water everywhere). The tab water thing is easily explained by the fact, that restaurant stuff is paid more in Germany than in the States. Restaurants cover their expenses with the prices on food, but make their profit on drinks.

another thing:

* yes, food might seem more expansive in Europe compared to the states. You won't get a happy meal for 2 € or your 1.29 Dollars. However real food aka. fruite, vegtables etc. are far cheaper. No need to pay freaking 2-3 dollars / € for a simple bell pepper. And apples really taste like apples, aren't manipulated to taste like chocolate or vanilla or such.

* oh, you are also in for treat when it comes to european sweets, as they aren't made with cornsirup, but rather with cane sugar.

* you will probably feel perfectly at home when it comes to music and movies, since in Europe we listen to a lot of american artists and our cinemas are filled with movies from Hollywood.

true,randomherRro,ROMA,Romania,"In Romania, we use PEGI as a game rating system. However, I would not go and talk about this as I find it that physical copies of games are rarely sold. In the last four years I have only purchased Fallout: New Vegas as a physical copy and I plan to do so with only one or other two games that are cheaper than what Steam manages to offer.

Movies and shows have a rating system but I cannot find its name. Every number or letter that is posted is encircled, but I cannot write it like this here. However:

There are movies and shows with no ratings, those being the most child-friendly ones, such as the shows that are solely designed for them.

(AP) - I'd translate this roughly to Parental Agreement. Children who are under 12 should watch shows along with an adult or after the adult allowed them himself to do it. A lot of movies and shows have this rating, and even movies like Home Alone have it. 

(12) - Children under 12 are not allowed to watch these shows. I do not see too much of a difference between this and (AP). There might be some minor violence and harsher language during these shows.

(15) - Children under 16 are not allowed to watch such movies and shows. Such movies are not porn or erotic, they do not feature strong violence and gore, but they are generally harsher than (12) movies, although I have seen a lot of movies that weren't supposed to use this rating.

(18) - Our ole' classic porn, but also erotic movies. Gore, such as in SAW movies also falls into this category. Recently, the law has been changed and such shows are not allowed on TV earlier than 1:00 AM and later than 6:00 AM. Before this, you could have found such movies starting with 12:00 AM.

These ratings do not actually mean too much. This is because news bulletins provide much more shocking content than a (15) movie can. We have a TV station, Pro TV, and they have a series of news bulletins during daytime. The one at 17:00, however, is filled with news reports about murders, rapes, robberies and whatnot. I find such a montage, even though it does not depict graphical content, much more shocking for a child than American Pie, let's say.

Und hier ist das Ding: ""Nummer"" (von lat. ""numerus"") hat die ""Zahl"" nie völlig abgelöst, sondern hat sich in eine Nische gesetzt und Konnotationen angenommen, die es in der Ursprungssprache nicht hatte. Das passiert mit Fremdwörtern. Man nimmt sie auf, auch aus dem Englischen, dann werden sie eine Weile hin und hergedreht und in der Regel bleiben dann auch nicht alle, sondern nur die, die sich in eine Nische setzen und dem vorherigen Wort (falls es eins gab), ein bisschen Arbeit abnehmen können.
Dabei kann das Wort übrigens auch umlernen und muss gar nicht das gleiche tun wie in der Ausgangssprache. Das ist das Schöne an der Sache.
Und im Moment probiert man halt aus, ob Hotline vielleicht doch besser in die Nische passt als ""Service-Nummer"". Bei den meisten Hotlines von Service zu sprechen, finde ich sowieso etwas gewagt.
Wenn's nicht gefällt, ist das ja durchaus okay, dann benutzt man es eben selbst nicht. Was mir auf den Keks geht, ist der Druck, der von Institutionen wie dem chronisch uninformierten, unwissenschaftlichen Verein deutsche Sprache e.V. ausgeht.
Lasst die Leute doch mit den englischen Wörtern spielen. Keine Angst, die meisten Absurditäten werden eh nicht bleiben und die anderen werden erwachsen und finden schon ihren Platz.
Einfach entspannt zurücklehnen. Wie gesagt, dir muss ja gar nicht alles davon gefallen, manche Sachen finde ich auch blöd. Aber das reguliert sich schon von selbst, da muss man keine Großdemo veranstalten (nicht, dass ich dir das vorwerfe, dem VdS aber schon).

Für weitere Lektüre empfehle ich das Bremer Sprachblog und das Sprachlog, bzw. generell den Linguisten und Anglisten Anatol Stefanowitsch (Autor beider Blogs).

Übrigens, diese ganzen ""ohgottfremdwörter!""-Begegnungen sind auch nicht neu und die ganzen ""respektablen"" Fremdwörter aus dem Lateinischen und Französischen wurden genauso bekämpft wie heute die Englischen. ""Fenster"" zum Beispiel, oder ""Urne"". 
Die Vorgänger des VdS hießen damals, im 17. Jahrhundert, z.B. ""Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft"" und ""Teutschgesinnte Genossenschaft"". Genützt hat's ihnen aber nix und ich glaube, wir sind alle froh, dass die ""Urne"" heute nicht ""Leichentopf"" heißt.

Generally good, tasty, ""kebab plate"" like stuff mostly from lamb, vegs, yoghurt. Large portions. Never been to an Albanian restaurant but my second hand impression is that it would be similar to a Turkish one. That means good. (Unrelated, but: if you like this stuff, try a Persian restaurant sometime. Probably the best of these kinds. Incredible yoghurt.)

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; Unfortunately, these things have a tendency to subtly influence people's opinions. 

Oh, so what you are saying is that every nationality has to be portrayed in the way *they* prefer, or ""otherwise it will subtly influence peoples opinions"". Or, they will whine?  Or, just the Poles? Otherwise - can you give me a name of a single historical work of fiction, or movie, where people are 100 % correctly portrayed? 

With your attitide - we can no longer make any movies or tv shows. Is that what you want? There is always someone who can be insulted. 

Btw -where is your responsibility? Why don't you make movies, become excellent or something, so that peoples opinions change? 


&gt;Free speech goes both ways. You have the right to say whatever you want and I have the right to criticise you if I disagree

Yes, but the Poles do not come across as true champions for the freedom of speech, liberty and freedom. They come across as whiners. Had they taken to the streets to protect the rights of gays to marry - I would have supported then. Had they protested the treatment of Snowden - I would have been happy. Instead they spend their time whining that a work of fiction is not to their liking. 

They have a right to whine - correct. I also have the right to call them whining crybabies, which they are. 

&gt;This isn't about trying to control fiction. 

Yes it is. You, and the Poles, seems to think that the world ""owes"" you to be portrayed in the manner you choose. Illustrated by this sentence for example *Every single portrayal of Eastern Europe in the media has been negative *. Obviously not true, I can find positive media portrayals. That sentence is just whining - I am sorry, but it is. You take on this victim attitude, and since you are victims, the rest of us owes you. 

Frankly - the world owes you nothing. Grow up and start making your own impact then. Make good movies, become rich or whatever. And, accept that no one likes a whiner. I have a lot more respect for the Russians, who has been far more villified than the Poles since the beginning of movies. They however, get on with it and don't complain. I can tell you, if the Brits had whined this much about that horrible American movie where the Americans (obviously a lie) stole the Enigma machine I would have been horrified. Instead they made fun of it, and kept a stiff upper lip. I respect that - I do not respect people who whine every time someone make a movie they don't like. 

Grow up. If you don't like it, make new and better tv shows. No one likes or even respects whiners. The Poles have managed to make me loose all kinds of respect for them with this. The Poles are not unique, nor are the Eastern Europeans. If you don't like how you are portrayed - fix it, don't whine. The world doesn't owe you any favour that means that Eastern Europe (unlike everyone else) gets to dictate how they are portraed.

No tomatoes or nothing. 

Grind down 1-2 big onions. Sautee on oil. Let it cool a bit. Add like  5 heaped teaspoons of bright red paprika powder and a really tiny bit of hot water, like 0.5 dl. Add between half a kilo to kilo of any meat, preferably juicier, for example chicken thighs are just right. If fresh don't add water, as it will release water, if frozen add a little bit but overall the water should not be much, make it a thick sauce.

Den Nachrichten wird die gleiche Sendezeit wie den Magazinen, nämlich 26 Prozent, eingeräumt. Festgestellt wurde ebenfalls, dass in einer Vielzahl von Beiträgen „die Faszination von Technik allgemein, aber insbesondere von Militärtechnik genutzt wird, um dem Zuschauer über das Faktische hinaus Spannung zu bieten“.[8]

I almost stopped reading here.

So, the guy has a second apartment in Paris, by the Eiffel Tower no less, spends his days eating at fancy restaurants in the XIVe and bitches about gloom. 

Well no fucking shit there's going to be some cuts and it's the people who can afford a second apartment in the XIVe while everyone else pays 30% or more of their income on rent and has to deal with tons of bullshit in finding housing all the while having trouble finding a job (without which you can't get an apartment), are the ones who are supposed to get hit the most. 

There are some reforms on the way for the housing market and I hope this guy gets taxed for having an apartment that he only uses a few days every 3 months.

No. I'm saying that for a series that takes itself serious, portraying the poles as crazed blood hungry bastards and the Nazi's as simple soldiers trying to get by is the same as portraying the Jews as money grubbing bastards and Hitler as the saviour of Germany.

&gt;Yes, but the Poles do not come across as true champions for the freedom of speech, liberty and freedom.

And you are? You just spent the last three days trying to silence people for criticising something.

&gt;They come across as whiners. 

Your language is gay. 

&gt;Had they taken to the streets to protect the rights of gays to marry - I would have supported then. Had they protested the treatment of Snowden - I would have been happy. Instead they spend their time whining that a work of fiction is not to their liking. 

A million people do that everyday on the internet. Are they all morons because they don't fit your very narrow view of the world?

&gt;They have a right to whine - correct. I also have the right to call them whining crybabies, which they are. 

If they're whiny crybabies then so are you. 

&gt;Yes it is. You, and the Poles, seems to think that the world ""owes"" you to be portrayed in the manner you choose.  

And the Jews. Don't forget the Jews.

&gt;Illustrated by this sentence for example *Every single portrayal of Eastern Europe in the media has been negative *. Obviously not true, I can find positive media portrayals. That sentence is just whining - I am sorry, but it is. You take on this victim attitude, and since you are victims, the rest of us owes you. 

Show the five positive portrayals of Romanians and Bulgarians in the media.

&gt;I have a lot more respect for the Russians, who has been far more villified than the Poles since the beginning of movies. They however, get on with it and don't complain.

Funny how their lack of complaining is the reason for their constant portrayal as villains. 

&gt; I can tell you, if the Brits had whined this much about that horrible American movie where the Americans (obviously a lie) stole the Enigma machine I would have been horrified. Instead they made fun of it, and kept a stiff upper lip. I respect that - I do not respect people who whine every time someone make a movie they don't like. 

You're whining right now. Do you hate yourself?

&gt;The Poles have managed to make me loose all kinds of respect for them with this. 

Your generalization is interesting. Might I ask how you came to the conclusion that three or four people on the internet define a nation of 40 million?

true,anarchisto,ROMA,Romania,"2000 years ago, there were probably a lot of Proto-Albanian speakers in the Balkans. We don't know where they lived and we can't identify them with ancient people (Illyrians, Dacians, Getae, Thracians, etc), but based on their vocabulary, we know they lived in the mountains, probably in parts of Bulgaria, Serbia/Kosovo, Romania, Croatia or Bosnia. 

Everything was conquered by the Romans, who brought their own language and culture, as well as some colonists. While the colonists were rather few, they were able to assimilate a part of the Proto-Albanians (probably those living in the valleys), thus creating the people who we would later know as ""Romanians"".

The Proto-Albanians who were not assimilated (probably living in more isolated mountainous regions) did nevertheless get their pockets full of Latin words, borrowed from that Proto-Romanian. For example, Vulgar Latin cavallu (horse) was used in Balkan Latin/Romanian as cal(u), hense Albanian kal(ë). Romanian also has a lot of vocabulary of Proto-Albanian origin, much of it related to mountain life and a lot of grammar features.

Romanian, Albanian and Bulgarian (and in some cases, Greek and Serbo-Croatian) share a lot of their grammar and it's thought that these were not ""recent"" innovations but rather inherited from ancient times, probably from those pesky Proto-Albanians. For instance, a comparison for the word mother:

* Albanian [mëmë](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mëmë) /mə.mə/ = Romanian [mamă](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mamă) /ma.mə/ = mother
* Albanian mëma /mə.ma/ = Romanian mama /ma.ma/ = **the** mother

The feminine nouns have ending in both languages in /ə/, which turns into /a/ when adding the definite article. 

Who were these Proto-Albanians and where did they live is still a matter of (nationalist) debate. Romanians claim they were Dacians and thus lived in what is now Romania and the Albanians claim they were Illyrians and lived in Albania and former Yugoslavia.

&gt;Die USA sind eine lupenreine Diktatur. Verängstigt, schitzophren, paranoid und komlett Wahnsinnig durch unzählige Sicherheitspsychosen. Eine derart winnige und gefährliche Bestie muss niedergejagt und unschädlich gemacht werden. Nur wer will sich mit der Bösartigkeit des Teufels anlegen? Doch nur kleine Fische aus der dritten Reihe, alle anderen trauen sich nicht und möchten ihren verdienten Sklavenstatus nicht gefährden oder verlieren

&gt;Der zur Wahrheit aufrufende wird heute bestraft wobei der Lügende belohnt wird. Der sich gegen dass unrecht stellende wird angeklagt wobei der unrecht verübende gelobt wird. Der Bringer Weltweit große Lügen wird als Rechtschaffen gesehen, dagegen wird der Bringer Große Wahrheiten als Terrorist und Unheil stiftend gesehen. Der Mensch ist von Gier angetrieben und kann die Gaben Allahs nicht wertschätzen. Das Christentum hat den Knecht (Menschen) zu Göttern und Herren gemacht und den Gott und Herr zum Knecht gemacht.

It is not my responsibility. The fact that you are asking me is making you a victim all over again. I know that there was a praised Romanian movie, 4,5 months, about abortions for example. 

However, you are not answering the question why you are not making better impressions, better movies. Why are you just whining? 


&gt;Your language is gay

So, do you hate gays? What is wrong with being gay? The fact that you even seem to think it is necessary to point it out is very strange. Also, it is not an argument, not at all. That comment says more about you than me. 

However, made some digging into that and have realised that Eastern Europe is far less accpeting of gay people than Western Europe. Why are you complaining about fiction, when there are real people, in your country, whos right are being trampled upon? Why aren't gays allowed to get married? Civil unions? Why can't they adopt and why are they routinely being beaten up? Who the fuck has the time to complain about movies when gays have no rights. It is right in front of you- and instead you complain about fiction!

[Wiki entry about gay rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Europe#Eastern_Europe). There is far more where that came from. 

&gt;Funny how their lack of complaining is the reason for their constant portrayal as villains

Proof that there is a connection between that. It is just *your* assumption, nothing else. I have access to all scientific papers of course (normal one, like Science, Nature, etc, since I am at university). 

&gt;You're whining right now. Do you hate yourself?

No, I am not. Nor am my people seen as whiners - much different from how I see you. You are however proving yourself to be incapable of arguing properly, or to distance yourself from your ""victim status"". 

You are determined to see Eastern Europeans as victims and everyone else should to, otherwise you will whine. For every argument with you, in particular after the gay comment, I am loosing more and more respect for you. 

Have a nice day. I will have to work, and have far better things to do than to argue with people who make unnecessary comments about gays people, or are so cemented in their victimhood that they refuse to leave it. Frankly, I am sure you will write some more, about how unfairly treated you are, and how mean everyone are to you, but it is only cementing the opinion I have of you - you are a whiner, complainer, cry baby and determined to stay that way.

I think we need to bring back democracy and the power of money creation and destruction to the public. Money is a tool that should be used to serve democratic interests.
In the words of Dani Rodrik, it's the “The political trilemma of the world economy”: 
&gt; economic globalisation, political democracy and the nation-state are mutually irreconcilable. Only two can effectively co-exist at any given time. Democracy is compatible with national sovereignty only if we restrict globalization. If we push for globalization while retaining the nation-state, we must jettison democracy. And if we want democracy along with globalization, we must shove the nation-state aside and strive for greater international governance.

Queste previsioni si sono rivelate sbagliate e i fan si sono incazzati alquanto. Quindi adesso si rifiuta di dire quando prevede l'uscita di WoW. Molti tra i fan sono pessimisti perché per gli ultimi due volumi ci sono voluti 5 anni a testa e GRRM non è più molto giovane e non è in gran forma, per cui tanti credono che, come Robert Jordan, non vivrà abbastanza a lungo per completare la serie. Io, considerando che ora c'è la serie TV che gli mette il pepe in culo per scrivere più velocemente (perché c'è il rischio di vedere la fine della serie prima in TV che sui libri!) direi che il libro potrebbe uscire nel 2014.

Even though I have a German passport and my mom is German, I didn't grow up in Germany. So coming to Germany was like going to a foreign country. This advice is not just restricted to Germany but applies to living in any country as a foreigner for a longer period of time.

For the first couple of weeks you will think everything is great in the new country you are living in. Perhaps you will even think that things are better than in your home country. This is the honeymoon-phase. 

Then some (often minor) cultural difference or oddity will trip you up and shock you. This will cause your feelings to turn right around and you will think that the country your now living in is the worst. Everything will alienate you and you will have the feeling that nobody really understands you. The new culture you are living in will seem really illogical. This is called culture shock. 

Don't worry about it. Most people experience this at some point. If you live in a foreign culture even longer you will experience it multiple times. The important thing to remember is that those feelings pass. 

Don't try to compare your own culture to the one you are living in too much. Just try to understand the current culture you are living in and adjust accordingly. Even if things in your own culture will seem logical to you try to just accept the way things are in the foreign culture. Some cultural things just are...they cannot really be explained by reason or logic. 

Knowing that culture shock will probably happen to you, will help you deal with it. That way you can identify it for what it is and mentally and emotionally adjust to it. At least that's what helped/helps me.

Also,while I agree that it is good that one take a look at the IMF and its demand (and hopefully something good will come out of it)I wonder why everyone seem to belive that the Greek saves should be perfect and ideal in every way. No other has received that, and the Greek people seem to have reached their primary goal, which was, according to my understanding and polls that I have seen, to stay in the Euro. That is a big plus for the saves. I mean, neither economists, nor economies or saving of either states or banks are or will be perfect.

I got pulled from my Mech. Infantry company to translate for a german Major. That gave me a lot of freedom and a chance to get around the country a bit instead of sitting in a foxhole watching goats cross the Macedonian border.

The people were real nice to me, but that was probably because I was a kraut.

Here are some random factoids because im bored and need to start writing again:

A lot of albanian chicks are very western and promiscious, however they will usually only do anal.

This is of course because of religious conditioning.

Their honor code (kanun I think altho theres another one) is really fucked up and has been responsible for bloodshed and revenge killings spanning generations.

Despite the society being deeply patriarchal, they have a strange set of rules by which a woman can become the man of a house and recieve the same rights as a man if she stays celibate.

progressive and backwards at the same time, yay!

Although they are mostly ""moderate"" muslims, their is a definite vein of supremacism and borderline facism to be found, traits that were often paved over by our media because they were our ""allies""(it is also one of the few muslim countries where you will find strong pro-US sentiments)

Often wed have kids doing the Hitler Salute when we rolled through, we saw a lot of Swastikas on the walls as well, usually next to an UCK.

Albanians have *completely* taken over a large majority of organized crime in europe, particularly germany. Its the classic pattern,  refugees from a war torn country are always going to be tough as nails compared to the local OC of a developed, stable nation. these cats are not to be fucked with, ive seen the fear in peoples eyes when they talk about the albanian mafia.

they cut off some heads, they showed everyone they were not quick to forget, and soon they ran a lot of the prostitution and drug business. There are claims they had some form of intelligence agency backing, this has been semi-confirmed for the UCK/KLA and Co during the ""war"". Intelligence agencies are not exactly known for cutting their assets loose, i.e....

(in times like these where the Gov is subsidizing the Sinaloa Cartel nothing would suprise me)

The crime angle was actually palpable.

You would roll through a ville seeing nothing but donkey carts, and then all of a sudden an audi a6 glides through with german plates, letting you catch a small glimpse of a goon in Raybans behind the tinted windows.

sure, the guy couldve made his money in construction....

the women are fuckin gorgeous, there is no other way to put it. they all seem to wear high heels.

lastly, we were on call for our deployment for over 4 months. both dates were *supposed* to be secret becuase a lot of ORF was about catching smugglers. we didnt know when we were gonna leave, and we didnt know when we were gonna come back exactly.

on the second day in country, we were at a laundromat, and this albanain guy winks at us.

he says:

""Hey, you guys are ORF arentcha?"" 

we were already a little perplexed, no one was wearing names or IDs

 we uneasily confirmed and he chuckled and told us *exactly* the day we were going home 2 months from then-

Le differenze sono immense! premetto che quando parlo di italiane e americane mi rifersico solo ad esperienze personali e persone che ho conosciuto. non intendo essere offensivo con nessuno, neè credo che un gruppo femminile sia superiore all'altro.
Ne butto un po' a caso e generalizzo per scopi di sintesi:
a) tendenzialmente le americane fighe di legno sono rarissime. se ti danno il numero di telefono, o ti invitano ad uscire (in un contesto espressamente di dating) è perchè sono sessualmente interessate. niente giochetti del cazzo da sfigate che se la tirano. se ti bruci un'occasione, nel senso che è chiaro che dopo un date lei voglia venire al sodo e tu non capisci o fai il timido, la tipa normalmente si offende sparisce e non la rivedrai più. trombare è essenziale nel percorso di conoscenza e l'inadeguatezza sessuale è spesso (ma non sempre) motivo sufficiente per non rivedere più qualcuno.
b) background culturale, geografico, etnico, di istruzione, di classe delle ragazze CONTA PIU' DI OGNI ALTRA COSA. personalmente non consiglierei di perdere tempo con contadine, rednecks, bianche ignoranti, madri teenager e via dicendo. Al conteario le donne amricane istruite, magari cresciute in luoghi diversi (figlie di immigrati europei, africani, mediorientali, asiatici, ecc), aperte mentalmente, che ho avuto il piacere di conoscere sono ragazze fantastiche. Le tizie di campagna che vanno a caccia di cervi io le eviterei.
c) le americane tendenzialmente esigono più spazio personale ed emotivo. gli italiani non lo capiscono e si fanno la figura dei ""clingy"" o dei ""creepy"" 9 volte su 10, forse perchè non riescono a concepire che una ragazza possa avere più partner senza avere nessuna relazione, oppure perchè sono più possessivi e melenso-melodrammatici, boh.
d) conoscersi, frequentarsi, stare insieme, fidanzarsi, sposarsi, spesso segue un percorso rigido a noi incomprensibile. In questo sono molto pragmatiche e sono schiave di narrative diverse rispetto alle italiane.
e) il mix di etnie e culture è una figata pazzesca, non vedo l'ora che capiti anche in italia.

se me ne vengono in mente altre ne aggiungo. ce ne sarebbe da parlare per ore e ognuno ha sicuramente avuto esperienze totalmente diverse. la società americana è troppo divisa per riuscire a generalizzare efficacemente!

That said, the fact that she came from the periphery of the Greek world meant that she would also have been regarded to some extent at least as barbaric, not unlike Alexander himself.

&gt;It's the worst capitalist depresion since the great depresion

Doubt it, have you seen the stats for some African countries? Do you want me to dig up some starving African countries who has received steel baths from IMF. And, there we can talk about short life span.  Again, why should Greece be more favourable treated than African countries. I am not saying they (or African countries) should be treated bad, but you seem to think that bailouts are perfect little things that can fix an economy that a) was broken to begin with b) is tied to the most imperfect of currencies. 

&gt; It's hard to believe that Greece would be worse without the bailout.

Apperently the Greeks think so, since they choose to stay. Had they not been bailoud, they would have been (more) bankrupt and had to leave the Euro. I would have chosen that, but they did not, and I think it is their, and their creditors choice. Or, are you saying that Greece could have stayed in the Euro and been better off? I'd really like for you to explain to me, in detail, how that would have happened.

&gt;They have lost 20% of their GDP in 5 years

And every single thing of this is due to the IMF? Really? You have not considered that what the Greeks (and other Euro countries, mainly in the south) is a loss of competitiveness due to being in the Euro? The Greek economy is not capable of competing with the German/Finnish (which is another reason I think they should leave) so they had a huge loss in competitiveness, internally within the Euro and externally. A lot of the things that are happening in Greece is due to that - not due to IMF or the troijka. I find it fascinating that you blame the whole Greek debacle on the one single player, and not the two underlying big reasons why they are in the state they are in - the Euro, and the Greeks themselves. 

&gt;. And this costed more than 100 billions to foreign tax payers. 

A lot more, actually. I am not saying it was perfect, it just seems that you want someone from outside to fix what essentially is a broken system, and a very imperfect currency.

Do we need to check the [definition of depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(economics%29)? Those countries didn't have a long therm downturn. They were always down.

&gt; Or, are you saying that Greece could have stayed in the Euro and been better off? I'd really like for you to explain to me, in detail, how that would have happened.

Did Greece solve their long term issues? You know the answer. The bailout wasn't about saving the greek economy was about protecting foreing financal institutions. And the conditions were measures that damaged the greek society and economy. The troika didn't ask Greece to solve the structural issues. They asked to cut public services, sell public companies and raise the taxes. But most of the issues are still here. 



&gt; You have not considered that what the Greeks (and other Euro countries, mainly in the south) is a loss of competitiveness due to being in the Euro? 

No, I think that the loss of competitiviness is due to other decissions made by our governments to favour the local fat cats and their short term interests. I am spaniard, and this isn't the first time that Spain has over 20% of unemployment. We had that before the euro.

&gt; And every single thing of this is due to the IMF? Really?

No, stop playing the strawman. I didn't say that. I said that the bailout did the situation worse, but the previous issues are important. And most of them aren't solved.

&gt; The Greek economy is not capable of competing with the German/Finnish 

And is it more capable now? 

&gt; A lot more, actually.

They are supposed to pay part of the loans. However, They can't pay their current debts anyway. Maybe we will know the final amount some day.  It's going to be at least 100 billions. But, It's going to be probably a lot more.

&gt; Also, in that statement you argued against yourself. Before you said there has not been such a depression since the Great Depression, now you are saying since the 90's. Sorry, have to point that out :-).

I fell into trap made by our slightly crazy right-wing guys. I think this series should get comments from some history proffesors but only to state that this is purely fiction and without freaking about how anti-Polish this is.

Poland lost this war both in the begining and in the end really so it's not ""just"" history for us altough I think our nation tends to exaggerate (I hope it's a good word). Germans are bigger winners than Poles since it's much better to be destroyed by war than 44 years of communism and we've suffered both, communism killed intelligence and started transforming Poland into land of drunk dumbasses. Communists are in politics and influence it (just not so openly) because they have never been dealt with like nazis in Nurnberg.

Did you know that in Poland it's impossible to judge communists in court even if you have proof? They have enough influence to get very high general's retirement ven though they killed unarmed people with their orders. I think that's why we can't get over it, WWII directly ""helped"" us become communist country.

We defended our country for 28 days (counting to capitulation of Warsaw) since 1st day of invasion and we got backstabbed by Russians in 17th day. On 25th day (of September and war of course) carpet bombarding Warsaw left us with 10 thousands killed and 35 thousands hurt.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Do we need to check the definition of depression? Those countries didn't have a long therm downturn. They were always down.

Sustained downturn in economics - I'd say a lot of the African countries have had that. And, for always being down, at least one of the reasons that they are down, is that they have been *kept* down, as colonies. So, that makes it even worse for them. For example, read ""King Leopold's ghost"" about the treatement  of the Kongolese. It will make your stomach turn, it was genocide. And, frankly, the fact is that those countries are in much more need of help than Greece, and they have certainly done less to be in the position they are in. And, to top that off, they have been harsher treated by the IMF, than Greece. So, why should Greece receive special treatment (which they have, and you might know that the African countries have complained about it, link [here](http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/swazi-king-complains-about-imf-1.1137778#.Ucg9j9iddnI) for example, I have more), which they have? They have received better deals, and even an excuse - not bad actually. 


&gt;Did Greece solve their long term issues

That is not an answer to the question I asked. You said they would have been better off without the bailout. I asked, that since the Greeks, according to polls, preferred to have stayed in the Euro - *how would that have been accomplished without the bailout*. Please answer that. 


&gt;But most of the issues are still here.

So, why haven't the Greeks fixed them? It is not up to other countries to fix the Greek corruption for example - only the Greeks can fix that. Instead, ask the Greeks why they still suck at paying taxes for example. No one can fix this but the Greeks. 

And, as for firing civil servants -why did they have a ineffective public sector to begin with? 

&gt;No, I think that the loss of competitiviness is due to other decissions made by our governments to favour the local fat cats and their short term interests.

I am sorry, but while Greece and Spain might have a corrupt economy it is also the fault of the Euro, there is no way around it, and it is Economics 101. You see, no currency is perfect, what one in economics terms call optimal currency area, but they are ""good enough"" areas, like the USD or the GBP for example (fun fact, a Swedish minister once jokular said that northern Sweden should have their own currency, since their demands are different). There are lot of things that have to be in place for an *decent* currency area to function, but a few things are these:

* Similar, but not exakt economies, but on somewhat similar competitive level, like Germany/Finland/the Netherlands

* Common bank system/financial integration

* Permanent transfer to poorer and less effective areas

* Political integration. 

There is more, but these are a few of the most important.You can, if you want to look all of this up of course. Furthermore - a recent example is DDR/BRD, where for example the economies were not competitive (DDR wasn't exactly exporting a lot on the free market) but then the other systems kicket in - BRD helped DDR so they had functioning schools, social systems, banks, enormous investments etc, until DDR could stand on it own two feet. It actually doesn't yet, over the years there has been more than a trillion Euros in transfers, but it is getting there. 

However, none of that is in place in the Eurozone. When the Greek economy doesn't work due to the Euro (+ they had a combination of low interest rates that made them go crazy)they don't have the huge permanent transfers to keep them going, the banks were saved in a bad manner quite unwillingly and politically it is a disaster. The Greeks are in a sense doing what they can, trying to improve their internal competitiveness with lower wages, since that is one of the few means at their disposal (it is hard to become competitive quick without lowering the currency rate). However, the lack of investment and the fact that they have to pay for food etc in Euros is of course taking its toll. However, none of this have anything to do with the saves - it is frankly Econmics 101 (please, google optimal currency area, Eurozone etc, and you will read about it). Also, since it has nothing to do with it, but the underlying factor is the construction of the Euro and the Greek economy, it can't be *fixed* by the saves. The fixing needs to be deeper. 

Also, what I am saying is in no way controversial, economists knows this. 

&gt; I am spaniard, and this isn't the first time that Spain has over 20% of unemployment. We had that before the euro.

But, you did have your own currency then didn't you? And, what was your interest rate? Rather different scenarion now, isn't it? How do you quickly increase your competitiveness without controlling the currency and interest? 

&gt;And is it more capable now?

Marginally perhaps, don't know. However, as I have explained, this has nothing to do with the bailout. To increase the Greek economy competitiveness there needs to be a) huge investements for a long time a la DDR b) a different Euro (and a whole new discussion) c) a change in the way the Greeks society works. 

However,the change needs to come from the Euro and from the Greeks - not from the troijka actually.

They have already received one debt reduction, there will be more. There is no way they can pay their debt.

2) They still follow old greek orthodox religion, their churches and wedding are all based on the same celebrations and traditions they brough from Albania all those years ago    

3) Before televsion was introduced, very few people from Piana degli Albanesi (or Santa Cristina Gela or the other surrounding arbereshe villages) could speak Italian - hence why the language has been maintained for so long    

4) The Portella della Ginestra massacre occured just outside of Piana in 1945 - 11 people were killed (inc 4 children) and 27 injured in a violent attack on May Day. It is unsure who the guilty party is, although fingers have been pointed at the Italian government , the Mafia and separatist leader Salvatore Giuliano

""mire se na erdhet te hore arbreshevet"" (except with 'ë')

In Berlin landlords do have a lot of problems with so called ""mietnomaden"" .. people who rent a place and stop paying rent after a while. Since german laws are very much in favour of the tennants the landlords try to make sure you will pay. So they ask you for a proof of income (contract, ""lohnabrechnung der letzten drei monate"" - a simple bank statement is not good enough) also the might want someone to bail for you (""Bürgschaft"") --- never get someone to do a ""selbstschuldnerische Bürgschaft"" - this is a red flag! --- also they want a written statment from your previous landlord that you are dept free, and of course the famous schufa. 

since you are an ""Ausländer"" you will not be able to provide any of this, except maybe your work contract with the school.

But don't be afraid. I would just be honest and open about it from the beginning, offer to pay a few months in advance if nothing helps and don't deal with ""Makler"" (Brokers ?!?) --- also try the different ""Wohnungsbaugenossenschaften"" .

Berlin has many empty flats and is very cheap compared to Munich and Hamburg for example.

&gt; Is Albanian considered a Slavic language?

No, it has its own branch within the Indo-European family. 

Within Indo-European, it's classified either together with Balto-Slavic and Germanic branches (based on some common words) or with Greek and Armenian (based on some other words and phonological features). But these classifications make little sense because there have been so many cross-language influences during the prehistory of the Indo-European languages that a simple ""tree"" diagram cannot be drawn.

But generally, Slavic is probably the branch with which it shares the most.

&gt; Or can it be considered a sort of a ""fossil language"", little touched by later Slavic influences? I'm thinking of the Basque language as an analogy.

It can be considered a ""fossil language"" in the sense that it's one of the three languages (Albanian, Greek, Romanian) to survive the Slavic settlement in the Balkans.

&gt;It is not my responsibility. 

Yes it is. You claimed there are numerous positive portrayals of Romanians in the media. Please point them out.

&gt;However, you are not answering the question why you are not making better impressions, better movies. Why are you just whining? 

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSeeYouDoBetter

&gt;So, do you hate gays? What is wrong with being gay? The fact that you even seem to think it is necessary to point it out is very strange. Also, it is not an argument, not at all. That comment says more about you than me. 

It's still gay.

&gt;However, made some digging into that and have realised that Eastern Europe is far less accpeting of gay people than Western Europe. 

The French rioted when Hollande pushed through the legislation that legalised gay marriage.  

&gt;Why aren't gays allowed to get married? Civil unions? 

They will be, assuming the new constitution passes.

&gt;why are they routinely being beaten up?

No more than in every other country.

&gt;Who the fuck has the time to complain about movies when gays have no rights.

Who has time for gay marriage when there are children starving in Africa?

&gt;Wiki entry about gay rights. There is far more where that came from. 

Doing better than the US. Woho!

&gt;Proof that there is a connection between that. It is just your assumption, nothing else. I have access to all scientific papers of course (normal one, like Science, Nature, etc, since I am at university). 

Nobody makes fun of the Jews for suffering the Holocaust because they made their voices heard. The Russians didn't and even though they suffered way more casualties than the number of Jews killed during the Holocaust nobody cares.

&gt;No, I am not. Nor am my people seen as whiners - much different from how I see you. You are however proving yourself to be incapable of arguing properly, or to distance yourself from your ""victim status"". 

Yes, you are. You are whining about people criticising something. You are a whiner. Deal with it.

&gt;You are determined to see Eastern Europeans as victims and everyone else should to, otherwise you will whine. For every argument with you, in particular after the gay comment, I am loosing more and more respect for you. 

They are victims of discrimination. Your refusal to see that is quite astounding considering where you were born.

&gt;Have a nice day. I will have to work, and have far better things to do than to argue with people who make unnecessary comments about gays people, or are so cemented in their victimhood that they refuse to leave it. 

Says the Swede. Oh Lord!

&gt;Frankly, I am sure you will write some more, about how unfairly treated you are, and how mean everyone are to you, but it is only cementing the opinion I have of you - you are a whiner, complainer, cry baby and determined to stay that way.

I was just saying in a extreme case that you would spend 40%-50% of your government budget on armament. 

I understant the logic of halting back a invasion, but unless those armored vehicles are hidden, they will be gone after the initial air strike. 

What I am trying to say is that in a modern war a small countries army can do little to nothing if threatened by a powerful enemy.

Governments can misuse this power, either by not having the adequate knowledge or by using to pursue political interests or simply corruption, but that to me doesn't justify we should leave this power to invisible hands. Again, this does not ago against the free-market necessarily. The finance of states and the productive economy are two different things, and the most efficient methods to one don't necessarily apply to the other.

There is a huge and general misconception around the process of money creation, even among economists, and I find it quite astonishing considering its impact on society.

I've yet to see one. The very opposite was proven during the 2012 protests when youngsters went out to protest against ACTA, corrdinated by social media, and then the USL piggy-backed the whole protest by sending out live instigators and the whole thing suddenly became an anti-Basescu manifestation.

Words don't change a damn thing. Actions do.
