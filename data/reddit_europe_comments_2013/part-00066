true,[deleted],null,null,"Again, you're failing to not only understand the mentality, but the practicality of the situation also: 

Ireland had only 20 years previously gained independence from a country which had spent the hundreds of years previous relentlessly raping and pillaging Ireland and its people for all they were worth. Also [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwellian_conquest_of_Ireland)  (although I am aware they try to avoid teaching about that in UK schools ). 

So as you can imagine, although Germany were going around being cunts to most of Europe, they'd never actually done anything to Ireland, whereas Britain had. Severely. Hence the reluctance to ally with them. (Also important to note no-one knew about the holocaust at this stage).

On a practical side of things it's even more simple. Ireland was not physically capable of participating in a war, in any capacity. The Germans had full invasion plans for Ireland drawn up should it have broken its neutrality. Had it done so, as you would have had it, the Germans would have overrun the country in approximately 6 seconds, this would have left Britain completely surrounded and thus Europe's fate would likely have been very different.

Finally, you'd find it practically impossible to find an Irish person today agreeing with de Valera's letter of condolence.

All in all, a very weak attempt at trying to paint the Irish as anti-Semitic. ",0,1365218734,null,0,false,0,c99hqoo,t3_1bphc7,t1_c99hqoo,t1_c99c955,null,1431656304,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

They said it or implied it once or twice and after that, the work of these journalists was filtered away from public, especially in the tv, internet newsportals and radio areas.

  The criticism they claim to use against memorandum and low acceptance governmental choices, is nothing than a cover from the people.  They use criticism only when it is convenient for the government and when they are sure that won't have any effect (i.e. before the vote of each memorandum they bombarded the people with what would happen if the government didn't chose to accept it and filtering out all those ""heterodox pundits""  you mention, closing all different opinions and making it seem the only way...while after some time, many ""journalists"" furiously criticised the government for voting it and the ""bad Germans"" for the woes of every poor Greek (while a few months ago the SAME openly supported this option-madness or Goebbelism?))

Its the same type of journalism that Spiegel does when it writes for lazy Greeks, Spanish and Portoguese...in Greece this type of corrupt journalism its widespread in the 99,99% of the media. Searching for a convenient scapegoat to use and changes it depending on the situation. Using no facts, no evidence, just find someone to blame.  When they can't cover anymore the Greek government and remain ""media that care about the truth"", they criticize with minimum damage made possible and invite in a ""panel talk"" some of those people you mentioned and many government elements and  in a ratio 1:4. For instance  last time i tried to watch a video at youtube from Varoufakis in a greek tv station programme they had him to defend his opinion against 5 government positioned people who were constantly driving the conversation off the cliff! When it was Varoufakis turn to talk, the programme host ""journalist"" would let him speak for about 20-30 seconds and after that would say to him all the time to please ""hurry up"" and ""others need to speak"", then about a minute later would take his turn and give it to another who constantly talked for about 12 minutes!!!!!

Do you think that regardless of what risks you take with your money, you should never lose? How is that fair? How is that proper capitalism?

The fact is, these banks were offering unheard of interest rates on deposits. 5% when most everywhere else in the Eurozone it's less than 1-2%. Do you think that that money is for free? That there's no risk when you're getting 2x-3x what everyone else is getting? 

Cyprus, and the EU, are doing the right thing by giving haircuts on amounts over the uninsured limit. Stockholders, bondholders, and yes, even depositors (above the insured limit) should lose money when their investments are bad. That's how the market is *supposed* to work. 

When did people forget how capitalism is supposed to work?

Vercors, in his book, mentioned this as part of a conversation, when the German officer in the book was praising French literature. I thought it was an interesting argument, that I had never thought of, which is why I remember it. The character also states how it's the same for Germany when it comes to composers... Germany has too many great ones to name just one. I realize the fallacy, and should have mentioned that obviously I know it's blunt, but overall, I do believe French literature is much more rich. Where the Anglo-saxons surpassed the French it's in very recent literature, especially when it comes to 20th century science fiction from the UK and the US, or thrillers of sorts.

But otherwise, in literature in general, I do believe France has had a much stronger influence, though to be fair that is probably due to the fact the English language only clearly surpassed French in importance relatively recently. The emphasis on the importance of language and literature in France, as part of the French cultural requirements, is still so strong that we have all these Académie Française types of organizations...

The last survey puts us with less than one book a year and 1/20 of the newspaper consumption of France, which has nearly our same population. 

96% of Italians take their news from tv, according to Istat, out statistics insititute. Considering that, we have 3 main public channels, 3 Berlusconi family owned, and one which was quite independent, but now bought by a Berlusconi industry relate dguy, so you never know. The 3 main public channel are managed by a Board of Administration which is composed by politically elected representatives which mirror Parliament's party proportions. Which meant a lot of Berlusconi representatives there too. 

The average tv news keeps it brief. When they report political news, they are forced by a law (Par Condicio) to give the microphone to everyone,as much as they can. What we get then is useless short declarations taken out of context, which make us unabl to understand party's positions on anything. World news are reduced to a tiny window, with no explanation of background whatsoever, so only educated people on the matter can grasp what's going on. EU news popped up oly when shit was going crazy last year. We are a EU founding country. I can still remember what happened with the milk quotas. They only showed us angry northern farmers. NOT ONCE they explained what a milk quota was and where it was coming from. Just presumed the news only regarded farmer and it was boring anyway.

If you compare the BBC reporting of a war abroad and TG1 (italian news), you will see how the BBC show you a map, explaining where the place is. Rarely done on our news. You will hear how if they say a name, they say who that is or what that means. Ex. BBC= ""the mujahiedeen, the islamic fighters of this country, chiefed by ... and fighting in the region of ...""; TG1 "" Yusuf Azzam's mujahideen are fighting in Khunar now"". 

Only recently online websites are quoting sources of what they say. Avoiding sweeping statements is just not in our culture. They would state as a matter of fact quite a lot of things. I guess that comes form the history of our media. Newspapers where mainly party instruments, thus many things did not need to be explained or proved, since they where vital to party ideology.

Corriere della Sera is, in my opinion, the newspaper which is making the strongets effort to modernize. At the same time, it still suffer from:

- terrible titles:they completely misinterpret the article they are on top of, usually just trying to aimlessly outrage the reader about something;

- still low use of links to sources;

- still too much crap with crap titles just beside articles about the war in Siria: ""the gorgeous Raffaella wonders if Mario will recognize baby"" or ""scandalous Scarlett in Venice"".

Lol as if there was a chance you would. If you are finding the question weird, and are wondering what's with all this fuss about the ""greek media being corrupt"" lately (as if they weren't like that since like ever), it's because the anti-EU parties have as of late started to attempt to portray the pro-EU media as corrupt and propagandist, and you are like, not supposed to listen to anything they have to say, with regards to the austerity measures in particular.

It's not that they aren't corrupt, off course they are, say the fuel cartels that the Troika complained about? Even the full 100% pro Merkel media won't really mention them. But it doesn't mean that when they broadcast a view of the greek economy that is shared by like 78% of the population of the continent, this view is just ""propaganda from Bobolas and Alafouzos"", as these stories are indirectly trying to insinuate.

And that guy Vaxevanis who is now supposed to be a hero of journalism cause he gave the Lagarde list, first of all he also worked for the aforementioned corrupt media, and then the lagarde list story is kind of stupid, cause everybody knew the people in that list were only suspects of tax evasion but could very well turn out to be innocent, and that no one would give a shit about the names unless they were the names of politicians, and no one did cause there weren't any, and Vaxevanis would off course have to get prosecuted and later released cause he broke the law, and you know what the whole point of this story was? So that after the above they'd go around saying that the prosecution of Vaxevanis proves that the government is a EU installed junta that doesn't want us to hear the truth. If you paid any attention to the above story you'd realize that this doesn't make sense, but in Greece hypocrisy is well tolerated and everyone is inclined to believe just whatever suits them",0,1365250144,null,0,1365250334,0,c99mwch,t3_1bsa4n,t1_c99mwch,t1_c99mag8,null,1431653801,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Wells, Anthony Trollope, Mary Shelley, Thackeray, Wilkie Collins, Elizabeth Gaskell, Joseph Conrad, Scott, Oscar Wilde....in poetry we have Keats, Byron, Shelley, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Longfellow, Walt Whitman, Yeats...

Now obviously the French have some notable 19th C *litterateurs* to consider...Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Hugo, Proust, Stendahl, Balzac,Flaubert. But it isn't at all clear to me that it's so obvious French writers win here. Why do you think it's so obvious?

The region of Macedonia was named after the ancient Macedonian people, etymologically from the greek ""makos"". It means ""tall"" or ""highlander"", a characteristic of Macedonian people. It encompasses most of Northern Greece, the modern day country Macedonia and parts of Albania and Bulgaria.

The modern day primarily-Slavic country wasn't even called Macedonia [until 1944](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Macedonia#History). Prior to that it was called [*Vardarska*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vardar_Banovina) (from the river Vardar). [Here's](http://macedonia-evidence.org/images/oimage009.jpg) a Yugoslavian stamp with the name. All of the maps before the renaming refer to the country/province as Vardarska, except of course when referring to the entire region.

I may be somewhat biased due to our ties with Greece, but historically it makes sense to side with the Greeks on this one. Slavs didn't exist in the region until about a millenium later and the claims on historical people are silly revisionist nonsense. What would you think if Turkey claimed Thales and Heracletus as their own because they were born in what is now modern Turkey? Or if the British claimed the Mughal emperors when India was a British territory? Funny thing is, Alexander was born in Pella, in modern-day Greece.

The campaign was met with a surprisingly large number of refusals from parents who would not allow their girls to be vaccinated (for free). It’s possible that the Ministry did not do the best job of explaining the purpose of getting the vaccine in a country with such high incidence of cervical cancer, but from what I recall, parents were also unreasonably distrustful. I don’t remember this situation occurring with other types of vaccine that are routinely administered, but this one was connected to sex life so the prudish, who are many, got alarmed.

[...et tressaillez d'allégresse

car votre récompense

sera grande dans le ciel]

Moi je suis Rascar Capac et je t'attaque avec mon mic

La vie, une chausse-trappe,

pas de quartier

quand les lyrics frappent.

Mon sourire te glace

comme un clic-clac qui grince,

Le v'là qui revient, mince !

tous les mardis pour te serrer la pince.



Donne-moi le courage 

d'aller bouffer tous les nuages.

Écoute mon cœur,

écoute la rage,

écoute ce texte anthropophage,

écoute ce mec qui vote réac',

écoute cette mère seule qui craque,

écoute le cri des animaux,

quand on les enfoui dans un sac.


On revient fiers,

tapis dans l'ombre pendant des millénaires.

Ces poumons t'éclairent

comme EDF au nucléaire.

Alors ferme ta gueule

Les argemiums marchent seuls

Pas de meuf pas de taf, pas de bouffe,

c'est bien casse-gueule.

Je me calmerai jamais,

j'en ai trop gros sur la patate.

Je coupe les pattes, t'épate,

encore donner des coups de savate.

Et c'est l'hypocrisie totale,

Peu d'espoir que ça déraille,

Et c'est l'apathie générale

Peu d'espoir que les gens changent mais...



Refrain :

Stupeflip vite !

Le truc est vivant dans les têtes mêmes s'il est cramé dans les fnacs

Tu l'as séquestré, bâillonné, ligoté



Cadillac en peer-to-peer

revient te chier dans le crâne,

faire un petit tas.

C'est au petiot que je cause

qui est en toi à qui je cause.

Dans ton for intérieur,

y a un enfant qui pleure.



Toi tu te sens plus, lui y se sent mal,

Tu l'as séquestré, bâillonné, ligoté

Tu le reconnais le petit gars qu'est en toi,

Le petiot, la petiote

qui chiale dans le fond c'est toi !

Tu préfères te cacher,

faire le steak, haché,

sous vide

t'as du mal à respirer.



C'est toi là-haut ?

Dans la cour des grands

tu fais semblant

le Coq, le fanfaron, la putain

Qui tourne en rond.



Tu crois gérer,

mais t'es mal digéré.

Il est où le petiot que t'étais ?

Il est mort le petiot que t'étais !!



Refrain



Je ne casse pas,

je ne me marre pas,

je n'espère pas.

J'observe les autres

qui partent en couille

ou en chipolata.



Vient pas me juger

je fais ce que je peux

avec ce que j'ai, grand.

C'est pas le carnaval des enfoirés,

ni Augustin Legrand.



4 par 4

je découpe mes rêves

avec un cimeterre,

noie les petits chats,

tous les espoirs avec un lance-pierre.



Mais d'où j'ai pas fait

tout les trucs que j'aurais dû faire ?

J'ai fait mes 60 prières,

par terre, dans la poudrière.



Foule sentimentale, je t'ai souvent cherché,

mais où es-tu ?

où sont les utopies ?

où sont les éveillés ?



Où sont les belles dames

les belles âmes

Où sont les cérébrés ?

ras-le-bol d'être tout seul,

Je suis fatigué d'expliquer.



Utopistes debout !

J'ai des lyrics en stock

et si plus personne comprend

je m'exile à Pétaouchnok



Alors laisse moi triper

Je suis pas cet esclave qu'attend le week-end

pour s'enfuir.

First of all, you're missing the 'want' in your sentence. So even if everything else was fine, you would still need 'wollen' in there:

Wir wählen selbst, welche Personen wir auf dem Zimmer zusammen wohnen **wollen**.

But I'm pretty sure that doesn't make much sense, or at least is not the best way to express that. A quick look in a dictionary lists the following for 'to share a room':

**[sich] ein Zimmer teilen** (there are two options, one with 'sich', one without. Not exactly what the difference would be).

Perhaps then it could be:

Wir wählen selbst, mit wem wir [uns] ein Zimmer teilen wollen.

Im pretty sure thats the case with North Korea, Belarus and dozen other countries. 

There is a set of criteria you can use to judge country.

&gt;The focus of this turbulence is the current prime minister, Viktor Orbán. He won the last election

So did Lukashenko.

&gt;There's been a lot of noise about antisemitism and anti-Roma sentiment in Hungary. Yes, there's prejudice and poverty in Hungary as there is in every country. It's funny how no one outside of Hungary was concerned about these matters three years ago, when the former communists were in power, and there was just as many hook-nosed caricatures knocking about and Roma being stabbed.

Again, criteria. There's this wonderful thing called statistics we can use to judge weather racism and hate crime are on the rise.

&gt;Changes to the constitution have provoked a furore. Are they good changes? Ask two constitutional lawyers in a room a question, you'll get three different opinions.

Two people disagree about something, therefore any discussion or criticism is invalid.

&gt;Hungary has a system of parliamentary sovereignty, just like ours here in Britain, and if citizens don't like the changes, well, they can vote for the opposition and change things back.

Sure, but in the meantime laws that restrict freedom of press are in effect.

&gt;Just as democracy doesn't guarantee justice, happiness, peace or affluence, having a democrat in charge doesn't guarantee efficiency or good sense

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"I support the idea of a (con-)federate Europe. 

However, and this is one tiny issue many people seem to gallantly forget when talking about their astounding visions of the future:

*Many people do not want this.*

They might not be the majority. Their minority might not even be large. But there are still millions of people who will not agree to a drastic increase in European power if it costs national sovereignity (and it must cost the latter if it wants to amount to anything at all).

Even worse, many of the supporters heavily disagree what kind of competences a European government should have, they even disagree about those the *current* one holds.

As I said before, I do share such a vision. The problems that would need to be solved are many in number and large in size, and thus do not lend themselves to a quick solution. Because of that, any quick solution, or I daresay any non-organic one (i.e. one that is ordered from above, and not grown out of neccessity), will not be able to truly solve those problems. It will only be able to keep them hidden until the next crisis hits.

As such, a ""European Republic"" is not even a viable soution for the mid-term. If it can ever be achieved in the way the ""dreamers"" think about it, it is a project for the next three generations. 

Taking a look at the current crisis, it is just that: current. It cannot be resolved by dreaming about a non-defined concept of a Union that is not supported in any clear manner whatsoever by a crushing majority of Europeans.

The best way forward now can only be to either better what we already have, or think of mid-term needs and let our institutions grow sparesly to meet those. 

Government isn't dictated from above, it's grown from below. That is the central reason why a European Republic cannot be bestowed upon the rest of Europe by its dreamers either. We all have to want it, and we all have to work towards whatever our consensus brings to fruition.

And if nothing occurs from that, then we should reconsider our need for a European government.

Can you think of one pro-bailout public intellectual that gets more coverage and/or better quality airtime? As for the 'there is no alternative' approach has it ever crossed your mind that this may actually be the case (as evidenced for example by Cyprus and Hungary)? I don't agree that the criticism is 'convenient'. People buy this criticism and then reject even the simplest common-sense things. The average portrayal of Merkel in the media is at best that she's an insane neoliberal and that nothing good can come out of her (not to mention the naive and oversimplifying approach that basically the EU is Merkel, Eurozone is Merkel, Scheuble is Merkel, Troika is more or less Merkel). On the other hand, you barely ever hear in the media that 9 out of 10 things requested by the troika are commonsense and non-controversial things for a Western liberal democracy. No wonder then that the average Greek shapes the view that the memorandum is all about punishing us poor Greeks that did nothing wrong. 

Another thing, so you say that MPs from opposition parties (other than Golden Dawn) are underrepresented? How is it that whenever I watch a panel talk there's always a Milios, a Dourou, a Kanelli (she even has her own show on Real FM) or a Notis Marias there? And what about the press? You've got a multitude of anti-government platforms there: Eleftherotipia, Efimerida Sintakton, 6 Imeres, Avgi, Rizospastis, To Choni, To Pontiki, Eleftheri ora, magazines like Hot Doc, Epikaira, Unfollow etc. and thousands of populist newsblogs and websites. This leaves what? Kathimerini, Ta Nea, Vima, Ethnos, Eleftheros Tipos, Proto Thema (with its widespread anti-troika sensationalism) and the hideous tabloid Espresso (which incidentally hosts on its frontpage today a letter of a student to the FinMin that allegedly ridicules him)? 

Having said all that, I don't disagree with your point that the Greek press has very poor quality and generally doesn't do journalism (but rather populism: telling people what they want to hear and/or promoting the interests of their main shareholder and allies).

You are not offending anyone by speaking English, the issue is that most locals do not know English well enough to have a proper or even basic conversation with you.  For that reason try to learn some Spanish.  Most foreigners who spend a couple of months in Spain end up with a passable working knowledge of the language, so it's definitely doable.

I'll just leave the absurdity here again in case some foreigner reads this far and can bother to attempt to make sense of it.

Here are the facts

1. The ""old"" ND and PASOK parties were corrupt and kept hiring their lackies in select posts with high salaries

2. Some of the most popular places those people are known to have been hired were the Metro stations, the Akropolis Museum, and the parliament

3. The crisis and troika come along and demand that those lackies in those specific places receive a salary reduction and/or get fired.

4. The PASOK/ND grudgingly accept this and attempt to take measures in that direction 

5. (here's where the magic happens) ANEL and Syriza (more like the non-technocrat and populist/syndicalist/corrupt parts of ND/PASOK respectively) vehemently oppose and try to block the measures targeting the people hired by ND and PASOK.

CONCLUSION: The pro EU corrupt parties want to enforce the IMF measures so they and their lackeys will control and abuse the greek economy while Syriza and ANEL are our only hope against this conspiracy.

It got me thinking that my parents were struggling to feed me. Not that they were poor: they weren't rich but they managed. The shops were empty. The closest to meat (which I as a very picky child would eat) would be fried sausage. Sausage made from meaty things and flour: one I would not buy today.

I turned around a corner to the vegetable area: I saw (and picked up) bananas, they are always under button 1. Perhaps a weird reminder of their arrival to our shops. They were extremely rare Soviet Estonia: people used to stick the Chiquita stickers to their fridges as some weird badges (or just as a habit). I think that I was 5 when I tasted my first banana. It was split among our family: I think that our father had a half of it to start with. I didn't overly like it and it was gone before I could remember its taste.

So. I felt kind of humbled by these memories as I'm essentially living in a western country with its problems with government straying from its purpose and people having no jobs.

United Russia works because it aligns different groups, from liberals to conservatives, and tries to catch the 'centre'. Putin himself is seen as a liberal moderniser by some, a conservative Orthodox Christian patriot by others, and even a socialist by those who ignore most of the reforms he made.

The Communist Party had the potential to win just on the older generation in the 90s, but now it has to get some of the younger generation in. The problem is that a lot of the younger generation have bad associations with communism and good associations with the free market. 

The good news is that a surprising amount of the young generation used the communist party as a 'protest' vote against United Russia. Tactical voting makes or breaks the Russian communist party, as even if young Western-style liberals realise that the Communist party is the best bet for a united (and stronger) opposition they might still not want to vote based on that.

This is all assuming everything stays the same.

It was so awsome and strange.

Soviet Union was also based on appealing ideas, simple and clean ones, with these big red stars and strong-hardworking people in every poster, represented in its system and technology, but also getting another, grotesque vibe when you lern that it is all lined with lot of horrible and unpleasant things.

true,IlDolceFarNiente,null,null,"I lived in Florence for six months and I made it my goal to live like a local and find places off the beaten path. I just recently wrote my friend a long email about things to do while there, so here is my best advice... Have a great trip! Buon viaggio!! 

Climbing the Duomo:
    You can climb the Duomo for the best 360 degree view of the city around. I believe it costs 8 Euro, and you can find the line on the north side of the Duomo (if you are in front of the Duomo, its the long line on the left side, not the line in front, that one is to go inside -- which is free). If you plan on doing it, get there early (8 or 9am) and it will be significantly less crowded and the line will be MUCH shorter. I've heard of people waiting over 3 hours in the summer, but we went early and it wasnt a problem. Going early will also help you avoid climbing during the hottest part of the day. There is only one stairway to go up and down (only in Italy) and its very small and cramped and people are going down while youre going up ... its kind of crazy but SO worth it
 
Museums:
    Same as the Duomo, get there early to avoid lines. Also, check with the concierge at your hotel, sometimes they can make reservations for you so you can go at a certain time and not have to wait in line. That can be an extra cost though. The Uffizi is where you can find many of Giotto's frescoes, Botticelli, and the Medici apartments. It is located just off of the Piazza della Signoria (where I lived!). The Accademia is where Il David is, you will see the copy in the Piazza della Signoria, which is where the original David was before it was moved. The big palace in that Piazza is called the Palazzo Vecchio, and it is the old town hall. It is now also a museum of the Medici apartments, and it is where they lived for the majority of the time. The Palazzo Pitti is also an amazing museum, it is over the river. If you don't have time to do all the different parts, I highly suggest the Galleria Palatina or the Apartments, I was in there many times and those were my favorites.
 
Santa Croce:
    Santa Croce is one of the main piazzas and is also one of the most beautiful churches in Florence. It is where Dante, Ghiberti, Galileo, and Machiavelli are buried (among others). You do have to pay to go in but its totally worht it. It is also one of the best places to go sit as the sun goes down. There are usually tons of people and sometimes music. The restaraunt on the left closest to the church (as you face Santa Croce) is great for a drink and to sit outside (I forget the name though sorry!)
 
Piazzle Michelangelo:
    The BEST panoramic view of the city. Don't google it before you go, let it surprise you. If you are coming from the center of the city, cross the Ponte Alle Grazie and make a left, follow the brown signs for Piazzle Michelangelo. You will get to the old city wall and walk thru it, then go up the stairs. Don't look behind you until you get to the top! Bring a bottle of wine and go watch the sunset, don't get suckered into buying anything (food or drink) up there, its horribly overpriced. It is beautiful during the day and night -- absolutely breathtaking, my favorite part of Florence.
 
San Miniato al Monte:
    As you're walking through Florence you're bound to see this up high in the hills above Piazzle Michelangelo. It is a beautiful church that you can go in for free! and the views from the steps are almost better than Michelangelo. There is also a monastery where you can buy honey and other things from the monks.
 
Food:
    I could absolutely go on forever about food in Florence, but here are some of my favorite places
 
-All'Antico Viniao: Your typical, hole in the wall, panini place but it is UNBELIEVEABLE. They bake their own fresh foccaccia bread and all of their ingredients are fresh as could be. They also own the Rotisseria across the street which has great wine very cheap. I lived down the street from this place and I still dream about it. Get a panini and a glass of wine and hang out on the curb with all the other locals. Don't be intimidated by the fact that pretty much everyone there is a local, they love Americans. (Via de Neri 71).
 
-Gelateria de Neri: Sorry to ruin any hope of losing weight while in Florence... but Gelateria de Neri is THE BEST. Don't go to Grom.. its a chain you can find all over the NYC. They have the cheapest prices, a huge selection of flavors, and they are the nicest people. I literally lived across the street and I'd usually go to All'Anico Viniao and then get some gelato after haha. My favorite was the Nutella and Straciatella (chocolate chip). They will also let you taste test if you can't figure out what the Italian names of things are. (Via de Neri 22)
 
-Trattoria Pallottino: This one is kindof tricky to find, but that's what makes it such a gem. It is very close to Santa Croce, on this weird curvy street that looks like an alley to a Chicagoan but its not haha. They have phenominal homemade lasagna and their house wine is incredible. You literally cant go wrong with this for dinner, and they have menus in english available. (Via Isola delle Stinche, ph number 055 289573) Its the only thing on Via Isola delle Stinche so if you find the street you can't miss it. Look for the yellow neon sign.
 
-Trattoria da Benvenuto: Phenomenal people, great food, lots of locals and regulars. Very sizable menu as well. (Via della Mosca 16, ph number 055 214833). It is on the corner with Via de Neri.
 
-Gusta Pizza: Incredible pizza. I actually still dream about this place and I can't tell you in words how amazing it is. Sit at tables with other Italians and grab a bottle of wine or some Italian birra. Tip - each of you should get your own pizza, trust me. Really cheap (5-7 euro per pizza) as well. It is across the river and they are closed on Mondays. I believe it is cash only as well. (Via Maggio 46r, right near Santo Spirito church)
 
-Pizzeria O'Vesuvio: Pretty much same goes as for Gusta Pizza, amazing. But it is slightly different than Gusta so definitely try both. It is a longgoing argument for which is better haha. On one of my last days in Florence I was there and the girl said to me - ""You, you come here every day!"" - its that good haha. It is where the cast of the Jersey Shore worked when they filmed in Florence but don't be turned off by that! (Via dei Cimatori 21R)
 
-Ristorante Zaza: Amazing amazing food. This is where I tried the infamous bistecca fiorentina and it was incredible, but so was the pasta and everything else. It is a little more expensive than most places but its worth it for sure.
 
TIPS:
    -You cannot wear anything sleeveless or shorts in the churches, knees and shoulders must be covered or they will not let you in
 
    -Don't buy anything from the random street vendors that walk around (often Somalian people) it is illegal and you can get in just as much trouble for buying it as the person can for selling it (they sell scarves, posters, trinkets, umbrellas, etc)
 
    -You don't have to tip in restaraunts, they charge something called a coperto which is supposed to cover the bread. You do have to pay for bottled water, don't ask for tap. Bottled water comes in naturale (regular) or frizzante/con gas (seltzer).
 
    -You also don't have to tip cab drivers. It is included in the price. If you call a cab, they will charge you from wherever they came from. A way to avoid this is by getting taxis from the taxis stands around the city. However, Florence is very walkable and safe for the most part, but be more aware of your surroundings at night in the Oltrano (across the river).
 
    -Many places don't take credit cards, even restaraunts. Always best to check before you eat! Good phrase: ""Posso pagare con carta di credito?"" = Is it possible to pay with a credit card?)
 
    -The streets have two types of numbers, some addresses you will see an 'R' after. That means look for the red number on the grey square. The regular numbers will be in blue on a white tile.
 
    -If you are calling anyone, give it longer to connect than normal. Sometimes it just takes awhile in Italy. They also don't have call waiting so if you're calling a restaraunt at a busy time you might not get thru.
 
    -Haggle at the leather market! Don't ever pay the first price someone tells you. If they say its a fixed price, go on. Pretty much everywhere has the same stuff. There is a store called ZIP Pelleteria that is where I got my leather jacket and where my mom got hers, they are legit and have great quality stuff. Paying in cash will usually get you a discount as well.
 
    -Check out the Mercato Centrale. It is the largest market in Florence and it is right in the midst of the leather market near San Lorenzo. Its the big green building, you cant miss it. It does close at 2pm daily so get there early! Lots of homemade pasta, fresh veggies and fruit, meats, fish, wine, you name it.
 
    -There is another leather market a few streets behind the Piazza delle Signoria. There is a bronze boar there and legend has it that you put a coin in his mouth and rub his nose, let go of the coin, and if it falls through the grate you will return to Firenze!",0,1365280378,null,0,false,0,c99uiil,t3_1bsmf8,t1_c99uiil,t3_1bsmf8,null,1431650140,19,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,19

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"^(Just to clarify, I'm not necessarily advocating the repealment of the Human Rights Act.)

The argument has two main points.

1 is that the way UK law works makes having a bill of rights kind of obsolete. It's all to do with us having most of the things the HRA lists as rights, without needing the HRA. The only thing the HRA does is entrench rights that we already (effectively) have.

2 The laws which effect prisoners. The European Convention on Human rights forces us to have laws such as the one which allows prisoners to vote. The European Convention on Human Rights says that every one has the right to vote *though it does make exceptions for extremely special individuals like rapists* (which is odd). But the UK takes this to mean that we have to let all these horrible people vote that we don't want voting. Additionally the European Convention on Human Rights means that we have to treat asylum seekers nicer than we would like.

So basically the argument comes down to: We don't need it because we work fine already, and it also makes us do stuff that we don't want to do.

^(Whilst I understand the arguments, I'm slightly fuzzy on the details. There's some parts of the European Convention on Human Rights that we have not implemented into the Human Rights Act, but I'm not sure which those are.

The problem is not the greeks, the greeks have some of the lowest Household debt in the entire continent. 

The main reason for this entire shitstorm was government spending, for example the 2004 olympics which cost around 150+ billion Euros to hold.

Combine that with a un-needed arms race with Turkey where 20 billion was spent every year for 20 years and you get the current crisis. 

as far as the ""filthy, lazy half-turks"" . . that is beyond stupid and racist. First that is racist against Turks, because you are trying to equate being a ""half-turk"" as a sub-human so it is not hard to imagine what you think of Turkish people . . . obviously our ""ape-like"" mind could never accomplish great works of art/philopsophy/culture/architecture/theater/mathematics/language etc . . oh wait. . . go read a book for once in your life instead of watching tv all day.

""Embracing fascism"" is a stupid thing to say when you consider GD is only supported by 2-3% of the population and only a fraction of those 3% are actually devoted to GD in any way besides casting a vote. There is already a major backlash growing against GD within Greece.

Federation = One Federal State divided in States. Federation works with majority (eg the majority has to agree to change something.)

Usually, the ""Competence of competence"" is used to distinguish confédérations from fédérations : that is, in a federation, the Federal State can change what it does (it has the competence to edit its competence) (eg in Germany - a federation - the bodies which represent Germany as a federal State can change (more or less) what is up to do to the Federal State and what is up for the Länder), in a confederation, the shared institutions can't (the rules of the UE can only be changed if the States of the confederation (the 27) change the treaties, but the EU (EU Parliament, Commission ...) cannot modify itself).

The EU is an awkward fit between the two.

edit :

Translated from French, so might not be 100% correct in English. It's from Hamon &amp; Troper ""Constitutionnal Law"" Textbook.

Confederation of States - several States can group themselves through an international treaty and form an organised community, called ""confederation of States"". The States who signed the treaty of the member States of the Confederation. The constitutive treaty of the confederation might create a central body, able to do/use/set up (don't know the right verb) the competences set up by the treaty n a limitative basis. Generally speaking, such such a body isn't made of elected MPs but of representant of the States, appointed by their respective government. Most of the decisions can be taken throught uninanimity, though some of them can be taken through majority if they address a non-essential point. **Hence the confederation - which is not itself a State - does not hold the sovereignity, but it still relies on Member States (Kelsen, 1945)**. [...]

Federal State - [...] In this case the community which has been created is a real State from two point of view. First,according to international law, it is the only State that remains. It and only it - the member States being excluded - can normally sustain international relations. Then, in domestic law, the Federal State gives itself a Constitution and exercise (?) the three functions of every State: legislative, executive and juridictionnal (?). [...] It is the Constitution of the federal State which determines (?) the federal competences, and thus a contrario the competences of the States. [...] The member States  receive their competences from th Federal State. [...] The member State does not have as the Federal State the power to decide about its own competence [...] it is then not sovereign [...] Authors  who make sovereignty the distinctive creterion of the State conclude from thi that the member State is not a real State [...]

[To add on this, it is very ovious in the EU vs the US. State constitutions have to follow the Federal constitution in the US (Federal law &gt; State law), while - for instance - EU law is valid in France just for the Constitution says it so (French law - the Constitution and IIRC the whole bloc de constitutionnalité and the organic laws &gt; EU law]

The EU case - [EU] is not sovereign  given that it has not the competence to determine (?) its competences, those of the States, and that it can only use the power which have been transfered by the States [to add on this, the EU gave a big fuck you on this principle since the European Court of Justice unilateraly decided that EU law was above national laws]. [TheStates] remain sovereign. they don't receive their powers from the EU but from their own sovereignty and it is thanks to their sovereign power that they were able to transfer some competences to the EU and they could get them back by denouncing the traties. [...] However, the EU only partially fit in the definition of a confederation. Indeed it is, like a confederation, founded on treaties and it only has the competences given by the States, indeed the States remain sovereign from the international law standpoint, yet, they have conceaded limitations on their power so great they were incompatible (?) with their [...] Constitutions. This is why the [French] Constitutionnal Council said several times that the treaties jeopardized ""the essential conditions of the exercice of the national sovereignty"" [...]. [The treaties] could have been ratified (?) only after the Constitution was revised. [...] [Thus] the essential conditions of the exercice of the national sovereignty were indeed changed [...] [but] it is only the [conditions of the exercice of the national sovereignty] that were changed, and the the sovereignty in itself remained untouched, and no new sovereign [power] was born. Thus, one should consider that the EU is still an iternational orginazation [ie a confederation], even though its powers are way more extended than thse of other international organizations.

Sorry for the mistakes.

&gt;Dutch deficits

&gt;Austerity politics lays bare kinship of core and periphery

&gt;The Netherlands, with its triple A rating and lower debt burden than Germany, is a committed member of the eurozone’s austerity phalanx. The bitter taste left by taking its own harsh medicine is a lesson for those prone to see Europe’s debt crisis as a morality play.

&gt;Shrinking output has forced the liberal-social democrat coalition to find new austerity policies to meet EU-mandated deficit targets. But it is hampered by its reliance on smaller parties determined to exact their pound of flesh.

&gt;The Netherlands’ economic challenges, if far from those of the euro periphery, show that the similarities between Europe’s north and south are greater than the public debate presupposes. Both The Hague and Madrid, for instance, ran satisfactory central government budgets as they rode a housing bubble before the crisis. Both now realise that private debt can be as big a problem as public debt. That cannot be said of the broader debate: Spain has no credibility to make the point; the Netherlands has no interest.

&gt;The Dutch struggle to bring deficits within the rules they insist on for others is also a reminder that public austerity comes at the cost of weaker demand. Deficit-cutting is best kept to good times or when public finances are so threadbare as to leave no other choice. The eurozone gospel of austerity by all – including those in decent shape fiscally – ends up bringing shared pain to both core and periphery.

&gt;It is a political predicament as well as an economic one. Dutch leaders no longer harbour illusions, if they ever did, about the political effort it takes to push cuts through in a downturn. Here, too, the Netherlands shares the fate – if in milder form – of counterparts more deeply afflicted by the crisis.

&gt;It is therefore in the country’s interest to use its moral and formal authority – finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem presides over the eurogroup – to herd eurozone partners in a more constructive direction. Progress on banking union is essential to lift the cold hand of private debt overhangs. A more intelligent policy on budgets is also needed. Only some states must cut hard to fix hugely imbalanced finances. Those in the core do not. Keeping core demand buoyant would be enlightened self-interest in the best Dutch tradition.

IN the city of Florence, I would recommend taking her to the wine bar [Volpe e l'uva](http://www.levolpieluva.com/Le_volpi/Le_Volpi_e_lUva_-_Enoteca_in_Firenze.html), but you should make a reservation there.

After your predinner drinks, take a walk up to Piazza Michelangelo to watch the sun set over the city.

Lots of folks will make restaurant recommendations, my favorites are outside of the city, but if you are carnivores make sure you try a bistecca fiorentina (or a florentine steak). Cut from the Chianina cow these massive steaks are cooked lightly and supremely flavorful. 

You and she should read a book called Brunelleschi's Dome, which is a great narrative of how the dome of florence was constructed. Once youre in florence you should definitely try to visit the Duomo, for the great view but also you will be able to appreciate so much more having read that book.

Finally, if you are going to go to the Uffizi or Academia, you should make ticket reservations in advance. Dont waste time waiting in line. Im going to try to find the number to call, all oyu have to do is give them a date and a time and the number of tickets and you pick them up at will call. No payment needed until you are sure you will go to the museum.

We should ask, will we be living much longer in 36 years? Well, the 122 year old died in 1997 and since then nobody has reached even 120. So the past 15 years haven't given us extra longevity beyond a certain point. 22 people have reached the age of 115, 4 got to 116, 2 to 117 and one died aged 119. So there's diminishing returns, and no great increase based on when they were born. AND these are the exceptions.

Not true. 100,000 Irish enlisted to fight- to which the government stated it did not object. However of this 100,000, 4,500 had deserted the Irish Army to do so, and were therefore ""punished"" in that they could not attain jobs because they lacked discharge papers. 
The negative sentiment displayed by some of the public towards enlistees, had nothing to do with them ""fighting Hitler"", but rather for allying with a country which had been slaughtering and enslaving Ireland for hundreds of years until very recently (You lads really, *really* can't see to wrap your heads around that aspect)..

&gt; more on his side than they were ours

Utterly ridiculous. While it's true that Ireland wasn't perfectly neutral, and had unofficial ""dealings"" to some degree with both sides, in the context of whose side we were *more* on, these dealings were **overwhelmingly** in British favour...

* Captured British soldiers were taken to the NI border and freed, and their aircraft handed over for recovery.
* Captured  German soldiers were detained until the end of the war, and their aircraft handed over for investigation.
* Most of the ""Irish collaboration"" with the Germans was actually carried out by the IRA, who are not actually representatives of Ireland as many British people often refuse to realize/acknowledge.
* Irish government officials met with their British counterparts to secretly discuss plans, and further aid Britain in their war effort, the details of which can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_neutrality_during_World_War_II#The_Cranborne_report).

They have 10% with voters under 30 but do terribly with older voters so the youth vote has to come out on the 27th.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Of course, learning anything is always an advantage but I would rather spend my time learning to garden or learning to assemble a bicycle (things I can do daily for the rest of my life) than learning a language for a culture I will never spend more than a few months immersed in at most when even if I were to do so I would always remain an outsider.

Of course learning a language is just one out of many worthwhile ways to spend your time, and ultimately you'll have to prioritize. I'd just like to point out one aspect that you might have overlooked in your assessment of the benefits speaking a foreign language might bring you, because you appear to focus on the access it would give you to a specific foreign culture. That's only half of it, though. It's just as much about your own culture as it is about a foreign one.

Speaking a foreign language permits you access to that culture, in a much deeper way than merely visiting a country would. It's a similar difference as between looking through a window and being invited into somebody's home. You still don't live there, just like it would take a very long time before you're not an outsider in a foreign culture anymore, but it still makes a giant difference.

By experiencing a foreign culture, *any* foreign culture, you gain a new perspective onto your own. You notice differences, and this contrast highlights aspects of your own culture that you hadn't been aware of previously. Things you grew up to naturally assume to be normal, that you have simply accepted as a given, turn out not to be so obviously the way to go about things. It doesn't have to be about something being better or worse, just different.  
Those differences are what make your culture your culture, and without recognizing those characteristics of your culture, you might miss out on some interesting aspects of those books you're going to read.

You have to learn to look behind the curtains. They are only superficially arguing about languages. They have an urge to debase each other, and one means of debasing is by forcing the other side to speak their language, even if the difference is just an ""e"" instead of an ""ije"". The magnitude of the differences are not important here. They just want to force the other side to do something they do not want to. It is just a chauvinistic display of superiority ""haha you have to speak my language, i fucked you, i fucked you hard in the ass"".

The underlying problem are the nationalists, of both sides. Nationalists emphasize such tiny differecenes and you suddenly have a war with 100 000 deaths because of microscopic language differences. Even if the languages were 100% identical, they would find something else to fight about. Then it would be ""your hat is different than my hat, lets get at each others throats.""

The solution to this problem would be to get rid of nationalists, the patriots, the anthem singers, the banner wavers, the homeland lovers, they are the source of all evil.

To answer your question, the thing is that Syriza both can't renegotiate the bailout as much as they are claiming, and behind all the loud exclamations they are making they are also not even willing to do so. Mark my words, for issues that have to do with whom they really want to economically protect, if Syriza gets elected they'll do an almost 180 degree turn.

Here is another counter intuitive story. When the crisis started the entire anti-memorandum block, half the country, where demomstrating and rioting about the traitorous government that signed the deals without being given the right to do so by the people, and that they wanted direct democracy and that the Merkel servants are ruling the country etc. etc.

So Papandreou proposes a referendum, and does anger Merkel, and what was the reaction of the vast majority of the direct democracy crowd? They didn't want a referendum! They started claiming that it was a ""false dillema"". Does this make sense to you?

My opinion is that the whole country knows that there is no other way out, even the ""rebels"". We are not going to expect the same group of people that would arrive at work 1 hour late and leave three hours early, to start an industrial revolution or whatever they're saying. 

The silent majority knows that they are full of shit. You get some golden dawn like types, working at the army being uneducated, scratching their balls all day, pretending they are tough-asses, and they are like ""ban all german products and leave the eurozone, we will create greek industries and never deal with those thieves trying to steal our petreleum, that's how we do it in the special millitary forces"". And most people that listen to this will nod their head but are secretely thinking that it's fucking retarded.

It is not obvious from the actions governments, the Eurozone etc takes. If want wanted a stable outcome, they would act differently. So, if you look at the actions, which is always the most telling sign of anything, it does not imply what you say. 

Nor do the leaders talk about it not being stable. And, as soon as a British paper published an article about a German economist being against the Euro, the most top voted comment was *not* someone intelligently discussing the issue, but someone who bashing the Brits.

Of course, not social science, or any science apart from math perhaps, is without political implications. That doesn't mean however that one should ignore it, nor not use it. The Euro is wrongly constructed and that is a fact. I would go so far as to say extremely wrongly constructed. That is hardly news to anybody.

Yes, but he didnt manage to establish an unified ""Yugoslav"" nationality, very few people (about 20%) labeled themselves as ""Yugoslavs"", the majority clinged on their fucking divisive ethnicity labels. And those who did label themselves Yugoslavs publicly, were considered ""traitors to their kin"".

As soon as Yugoslavia broke up, even those 20% who previously labeled themselves Yugoslav magically disappeared and went back to an ethnicity label.

If Tito hadnt failed with turning Serbs, Croatians, etc into Yugoslavs, we wouldnt have had a war. It would have been impossible to fight a war when everybody is a Yugoslav, the war was only possible because everybody exactly knew how to identify whom to kill. ""Look, the guy over there is wearing a Šajkača! -Then he cant be one of us, you can safely kill him!""

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;What? Governments have done nothing to address the EZ's faults. The only semi-relevant step was the ""introduction"" of the banking union, which was promptly dumbed down into insignificance due to the usual quarreling.

**Exactly**. I do not think we are arguing about that. I agreee. So, if the governments wanted to stay in the Euro or thought the Euro was relevant, why haven't they even bothered to address the issue? And, if the people want to stay in the Euro, why have they not asked their governments to adress the issue. 

&gt;Also, attacks of that nature are made on both sides, what's your point?

That the ones who wants to defend the Euro at all costs, rarely comes with arguments on how to actually do it, they just attack the messenger, in this time apparently the Brits. Other times it is an old commie, Finns who do not care etc.

&gt;What I wanted to highlight is that there's not much hard science that can go into it, just guidelines/best practices drawn from economic theory as, unfortunately, empirical evidence isn't available due to the inability to formulate any kind of useful experiment in the realm of large scale currency unions. 

There have actually been a lot of currency unions, at least enough to draw scientific (for a social science) conclusions. It is not news, or controversial, to say that one need large perment transfers for example - I can't find an economist who would think it is weird for a currency union. However, obviously, as we both know, this is not what is being discussed - it is ""the last bailout"", ""soon it will turn"" etc. And, I hope for that for change, that more people will point that out. 

&gt; Of course not even these guidelines have been followed (not so much a mistake, but a political impossibility), nor will they be in the foreseeable future, for many reasons.

Exactly, and a) it is not being adressed by the politicians b) it is hardly being adressed here in /r/europe as well, people are attacking the bailouts for example, or as in this case, a German economist, but fail to listen to the message, since they have decided that they want the Euro, even though he might have the facts right.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Europe could easily simply print the money. Quantitative ease its way out of this.

ECB cannot print money to cover for public debts.  
For example see: [ECB 'cannot print money'](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe/ecb-cannot-print-money-1.741561)
&gt; ""We should remember that the ECB cannot undertake monetary financing, cannot replace what other member states should do,"" Mr Draghi told lawmakers in Brussels in his capacity as head of the European Systemic Risk Board.  
""This is true for Ireland, and this is true for every other case like this. It's too easy to think that the ECB can replace governments' action, or lack of it, by printing money. That's not going to happen.""

And further elaboration here: [Why the ECB Won't (and Shouldn't) Just Print](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc111121.htm)  

&gt; There are three basic difficulties with this idea.  
(1) The first is that ECB buying might help to address immediate liquidity issues of distressed European countries, but it would not address long-term solvency issues, and would in fact make them worse.   
(2) The second is that **the ECB, under existing European treaties, has no such authority**, and the prohibitions against it are very explicit. Changing that would be far more difficult than many market participants seem to believe, because it would require an explicit and unanimous change in the EU Treaties that AAA rated countries such as Germany and Finland vehemently oppose.   
(3) The third difficulty is that even if the ECB was to buy the debt of distressed European countries with printed money, the inflationary effects would likely be far more swift than anything we've seen in the United States. This would not ""save"" the euro, but would simply destroy it by other means. ",0,1365333001,null,0,1365333362,0,c9a6fvx,t3_1bssn6,t1_c9a6fvx,t1_c99q89w,null,1431644448,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;That the ones who wants to defend the Euro at all costs, rarely comes with arguments on how to actually do it, they just attack the messenger, in this time apparently the Brits. Other times it is an old commie, Finns who do not care etc.

Can't really agree on this point, I guess. I've seen arguments on both sides, just like I've seen plenty of retarded, sarcastic remarks.

&gt;There have actually been a lot of currency unions, at least enough to draw scientific (for a social science) conclusions. 

Not quite, but you aren't exactly wrong. Please keep in mind that I mentioned large scale CAs specifically for this reason. While historically we have had comparable currency areas, relevant data wasn't collected during those periods. As a result, we can only garner a glimpse at an outcome that's murkied by our inability to identify singular effects. In addition, a currency union of this scale, under a fiat currency and fractional reserve banking model complicates things a bit more. All in all, you are correct on the fact that we know what works for sure, but we're not totally sure on the bare minimum required to make it work.

Your last point is poignant and we're in agreement, but unfortunately as the bare minimum is hard to gauge and since the known solution is overly costly in political terms, we'll be stuck in limbo for quite a while, unless, as you pointed previously, someone loses their patience.

Until Germany's elections are done with, we'll only be getting empty rhetoric for sure. Afterwards, well, I'd wager we'll still be getting plenty of vague bickering, but with a higher chance of decisions being made.

But, it isn't just up to the Germans, which is another thing I have been arguing about. As it is now, every day the Maastrich treaty is being violated, as well as the ECB rules, the stability pact rules - etc. 

To have a working currency union, (I think both you and I can agree about this) there needs to if the economies are as different as they are in the EZ, huge permanent transfers, pooling of debt/debt reduction, working banking union and more autonomy for the ECB with perhaps slightly different goals. 

However - that means that the Maastrich treaty, currently involving 25 countries needs to be re-written. Constitutions needs to be changed. Also, for a currency union to work, the huge current democratic deficit needs to be adressed. Germany alone can most certainly not change it, and there is a very huge and real chance that countries like Finland will say ""Fuck it, we are not paying off the south forever"" and break free. Also, the negotiation will take years/decades. And, more important than anything else  - the people *need* to be able to vote about it. 

However, no one dares to let the north vote since the people would say no. And, that is a dangerous and undemocratic, and it can not be fixed by German elections. The only thing that can fix that is letting people know what they are in fore, and then vote - in all countries, not just Germany.

The pro -Euro people are not even attempting to adress this issue, it is constatly glossed over. And, that is one of the biggest reason why I actually hope the Euro will fail (although I do not like the personal tragedies that will follow). If one is  that un-democratic, it is good if one fails.

Instead upvote it for visibility and explain why in your opinion is wrong.

For example: I need to point out that this article is misinformed and one-sided. the terminology for describing the divided island is wrong. it acts as if the island has no legal entities and is on both sides a puppet. This is not the case since the Republic of Cyprus (south) is the one and only legal independent state on the island.

The water issues have been solved in the island with the creation of desalination plants. Expensive, yet they show the level of independence that the island can have when Turkey leaves us alone.

To assume that the economic crisis wouldn't have hit the island with the acceptance of the reunification plan in 2004 is wishful thinking and a bit ignorant, since it ignores other problems, issues and possible economic strains that the new government would have had to face. The people had said no to the ""Anan plan"" in 2004 and this must be respected, wishful thinking like and putting pressure because of the present situation, for Turkey to get what it wants, is unethical and must not be tolerated.

So please, Europeans around, the economic measures taken are probably well deserved because of the economic mistakes made on this island. But will you accept a country member to be bullied like this?

Of course it can. But that doesn't mean Finland's economy would be ""just as fragile"" as some other economies have shown to be. 

And in Q2/2009 we actually had a whopping record drop *-10%* of GDP, and -7.8% through the year - the worst since the Civil War 1918. See this [graph](http://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/tilastot/indikaattorit/Pages/tilastot_indikaattorit_bkt_ja_ttuotanto_amuutos_chrt_en.aspx).

Yet Finland managed that crisis by herself without asking the help of IMF or EU taxpayers, without general strikes or riots on the streets, without having an excessive rise of public debt, and while retaining it's high credit rating. 

Apparently Finland handled the crisis so smoothly that not everybody seem to be aware of it at all. ;)

This will tie with my response regarding Germany, below.

&gt;Well, I do not understand why one should aim for the bare minimum at all? 

We shouldn't, true, but the first-best solution isn't politically feasible. It seems that the only solution that can hold the EZ together in the medium-run requires the least risk exposure possible.

&gt;But, it isn't just up to the Germans, which is another thing I have been arguing about. As it is now, every day the Maastrich treaty is being violated, as well as the ECB rules, the stability pact rules - etc. 

Technically correct, but remember that unanimity is required, such that a solution will require Germany's blessing. It just so happens that Germany is unwilling to commit to any decision before their elections. While other member states might be tempted to do the same but their clout isn't comparable to Germany's.

Yes, everything needs to be evaluated, but the system is so broken that states will never even be able to comply with Maastrich in the short-term. Some never even stood a chance without facing perma-recession (doesn't mean those states were right in their doings).

You're absolutely correct, since labor movement is so de-facto restricted (closet xenophobia, language barriers, etc) transfers (debt pooling/inflation/banking union can be seen as subsets of transfers, it's all about subsidizing and transferring wealth) are absolutely necessary for the Euro to work. I agree that your outline is how it should work and it will never work happen for those reasons you highlighted. 

Unfortunately, the member states have been hamfisting their policies regarding the EU for quite a while. Whenever they let the populace vote, it's because they've given up on it themselves, otherwise they will try to avoid having any kind of democracy in the process, which is why Germany's clout becomes so central. It's not because they should be deciding alone, but rather because they're the only ones that, if they wish it, can force the issue (no, I'm not accusing Germany of conquering Europe or other such nonsense). 

The pro-Euro people in politics are definitely not addressing the issue, because it's a lost cause to them. I just don't share much of your enthusiasm because it will have very painful consequences.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"That's easy to say, but hard to realise. Think about it this way: how do you get people to be represented? In order to forget states, you would need to have some form of organisation other than states that are a viable alternative *now*. I cannot think of one, but there might be others. But for now, let's say that for the people to be represented, you require something resembling states.

The question here becomes on what magnitude. And I say that, akin to a biological system, in order to prevent centralised power from weakening individual representation (and we want to maximize that!), you need to divide the state into more managable parts. 

Hence the idea of a confederation or a federation. Now you would then have to argue in favour of a federation, but one federation doesn't equal the other. One example would be the ultimate executive force, the military. There is broad wiggle room within the idea of federation for nearly all types. From one centralised military force (like Germany has), over a federal military force with national militias (like the US has), to a non-existent ""federal"" military force (like the EU has). And this is only one issue.

So to say that ""we should give power back to the people"" is again a nice idea, but it is, at the moment, very much intertwined with the idea of a state as an organisational principle. Can you change that principle? Can you make nearly half a billion people change their ideas of how to organise their political lives, ideas which are centuries old?

Unless you can change that, then trying to heal the current lack of popular say in EU matters by ursurping state sovereignity is contrary of what you want to achieve, because you will only end up with a more powerful and less representative state.",0,1365337358,null,0,1365337569,0,c9a6y5i,t3_1bsjfq,t1_c9a6y5i,t1_c99w93u,null,1431644208,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I've also no idea what you actually want. What is ""free spirit and upbeat, relaxed personality"" in a city? I've been in NL multiple times (without speaking Dutch) as well as Paris (without speaking French) and it was pretty much as I've expected it to be. I expected Paris to be the big, noisy city and I got a big noisy city. Have you tried to talk to people? Hell... Talking to people is not even required. I gave a homeless dude next to my hotel 5€ because I felt bad for him that he sad next to that expensive hotel in the street and I got a ""bonjour"" and a hat tip every day I got out of the hotel. I felt very comfortable in Paris.

I was only in small cities in NL and it was also how I've expected it. It was a mixture out of village and city (I think ""town"" would be fitting but German only has one word for city and town so I want to make sure you know what I mean). We got frikandeln and chips with onion from some dirty little shop and that dude was really nice and chatted a bit (he spoke pretty decent German). We watched football (the world cup was on) in a Dutch pub and when we won the match, we got beer for free and everybody was cheering for us (keep in mind that the biggest football rivalry in Germany is with the Dutch. NOT THE ENGLISH!). The towns (city, whatever) looked really nice with small streets and some idiots the British would probably call ""chavs"" who though their little scooters were the shit. Oh... we also smoked weed with some dude on his little boat who put on some Paul Kalkbrenner. Not like I expected it (football is serious business after all) but it was a nice surprise. 

So what exactly do you mean? Do you want a mixture of relaxed atmosphere and city feeling? Take a look at most bigger German cities. You'll most likely find big parks where people have a BBQ or just relax in the sun in the centre of the city. I know Düsseldorf has one of those parks, Munich does, Berlin does and Cologne, Hamburg, Bremen, Frankfurt and most other cities do as well, I suppose.

Based on the assumption that OP was working legally in Germany, he would already have had the appropriate visa and already would have been legally eligible for social benefits. The fact that these were revoked was probably either a result of OP's visa expiring or the case worker in charge making an honest mistake.

&gt; The ongoing petition at www.greece.org/blogs/wwii/ is receiving support and solidarity from people around the world (over 188,000 signatures by now), which proves the clamor for justice by the global community.

Yes, the equal of 2% of the population of Greece pushing a button obviously is an international outrage by today's standard.

&gt; In the presence of the indefensible massive evidence ...

Evidence that is indefensible is not evidence. Maybe an error in translation?

&gt; ... Germany has never denied or disputed the damages, but is systematically using artificial legal obstacles to delay settlement. On the other hand, the international legal system has failed to seal legal loopholes and has allowed injustice to be perpetuated.

Nope, there are no legal obstacles, there just is no law for this kind of claim. The author, an expatriate businessman according to page 2, seems to have no clue of the international justice system, let alone of anything but civil law. War reparations are not justice and not decided by courts, they arise from claims accepted in treaties for peace and capitulation.

&gt; Clearly in the case of Germany the Court has used double standards. Observing the justifiable eagerness for prosecution of wrongdoers like Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic, Omar al-Bashir, Charles Taylor, Uhuru Kenyatta and others, further demonstrates of how unfairly the Distomo and the rest of the Greek cases are treated by the international legal system.

Again no, as the ICJ can only judge according to existing law, which in this case simply does not exist. The ICJ is not an absolute monarch who can judge according to their every whim. It certainly is unfair when their is no institutions that you can petition for justice, but blaming the ICJ for that makes you look like a tool that either has no sense of reality or wants to damage the reputation of the ICJ. Speaking of which, with him being an expatriate businessman citing all monetary values in USD, I'd not even eliminate the possibility of him driving another political agenda unrelated to Greece here. Half of the article is essentially that.

Also, the treaties after which perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity are persecuted at the ICJ only came in force after WWII, which makes his argument even more shitty.

&gt; Only few months ago, three Mau-Mau Kenyan tribesmen, tortured by their British colonizers during the early 1950's, won a landmark case for compensations in English courts

Since when are English courts international?

To put the language requirement thing into cultural and regional perspective: Hamburg has no problem with young, hip Americans flying over to live for a period of time in Europe and be Bohemians. Thus, they have extremely lax requirements for people coming over. Of course, to live in Hamburg you need buckets of money since the rent is so high. However, outside of Hamburg, regional authorities do not have any real incentive to make life easy for Americans, so they are basically treated like any other foreigners (who are, potentially, a drain on tight communal budgets and require various social services and case worker attention). So, in going to Geesthacht you will probably encounter relatively friendly case workers who are happy to let you stay and live in Germany for a language course, but I doubt they will cut you excessive slack. And given a population around 30,000, you may find that the officials deciding your fate will not speak English. 

This is all just from my own grab-bag of personal experience. Your mileage may, obviously, vary. I'm just setting your expectations realistically, since I practice law in a similarly rural area of Germany (town population: 55,000), in a neighboring state (Lower Saxony).

Paolo Bianco è stato un mio professore: oggettivamente uno dei migliori, dei più preparati, e dei più competenti. In sei anni di medicina, l'unico capace di fare 2 ore di lezione senza slide, senza pausa, e senza che nessuno dicesse una parola. Le sue lezioni erano, letteralmente, accattivanti. A gennaio, quando per noi c'è pausa dalle lezioni per fare gli esami, gli abbiamo chiesto di fare lezione per proseguire gli argomenti trattati: aula piena, anche chi doveva fare un esame il giorno dopo era lì a sentirlo.  
Un uomo dalla cultura spaventosa, dall'ironia sempre presente - ci citò a lezione la Guida Galattica per gli Autostoppisti, le ragioni per cui si dice ""mi sono rotto il cazzo"", e via dicendo - e dal carisma immenso.

In aggiunta a questo, era esattamente quello che si vede nel video: una persona che proprio per la sua competenza spesso risulta arrogante. A noi studenti mandava (più o meno bonariamente) a farci fottere se ci presentavamo all'esame senza sapere tutto (e l'esame di anatomia patologica è immenso), litigava costantemente coi vari docenti del corso di laurea, non si presentava alle riunioni e non rispondeva alle mail (né degli studenti, né degli altri docenti o dei superiori). Facile criticarlo per questo atteggiamento senza sapere che dietro alla barba incolta e al ""fegato da rosticceria"" che diceva di avere a lezione c'è una persona che ha una cultura veramente spaventosa.

Venendo al dunque, la terapia con le staminali ha i suoi rischi, non da poco, che non so se qualcuno s'è mai andato ad eviscerare prima di sputare sentenze.  
un clone (= un ceppo, un gruppo) di staminali può permettere di ricostruire un tessuto leso. verissimo. lo stesso ceppo di staminali può dare un tumore. le cellule possono cominciare a riprodursi e, in assenza di segnali di stimolo, possono diventare qualunque cosa. la definizione esatta è teratocarcinoma, chi vuole se lo cerchi da solo.

Back then some Parisians took the piss out of me for speaking in a Savoyard accent, which struck me as ""whatever"", seeing as I'd done my deep emersion in the language just up the hill from Chambéry.

Ten years ago some more Parisians took the piss out of me for rolling my ""r""s like a Burgundian, which I took offence at because I've never spent any time in Bourgogne.

Since then my French has ebbed and flowed depending on how much I use it but what I have noticed is that there are probably as many accents in France as there are in England.

And being by origin from London and inherently capable of at least three London accents, 'sarf London (but not east or north), BBC received and Sloane Square I suspect that what you say about accent is wrong.

Although it does remind me of when I was working with a lot of South London Jamaicans and I could ""do"" their accent good enough for instant hilarity among both Jamaicans who thought I was rubbish and whites who thought I'd gone Jamaican.

They didn't force you to fake you numbers - Greece did. They didn't force you to do anything, take the loans etc -yet you blame everyone but yourself. I think it is sad, tragic and shows that you are completely out of touch with reality. 

There are a lot of faults with the Euro, but your special brand of blaming the Germans for everything is seriously only making your enemies, and no, you do not have some sort of truth, you are only denying facts. 

&gt;Also the italians did not go to the Greek bank during WW2 and ask for a 10 billion$ loan with 0% interest like the Germans did. This is the money greece wants back.

And, again, you have *signed an agreement*, which you honestly are mad enough to straight off deny. And, other people in this thread have tore your claims to shreads - read and learn. And the Italians invaded Greece, ask money from them.


To me you seem to signify everything that is wrong with Greece. You refuse to accept facts, or blame. Everyone else is, but certainly not you or the Greeks, in any form. 

&gt;Greece is better off out of the EU and making economic pacts with UK/Turkey/China/Russia. 

Bye , bye, have fun. Good luck with not becoming a puppet of those states. They are all known for their democratic and peaceful ways...............

true,TheVoiceOfHAL,null,null,"&gt;I find it much easier asking real people on a website that I know than scanning through some guide to find the bits I actually want to find. It's straight to the point here, quick and easy to just post something and get a few comments on peoples opinions about where is good to go. 

And that is exactly what you get at virtualtourist and tripadvisor.  

&gt; It's not a big deal. I don't really care that these sites might have people there offering help etc, I'm using reddit, also full of locals here to offer me suggestions or let me know their personal favourite places to visit, and I don't see the problem with me posting here!? 

Sure you can post on Reddit, but targeting sites like virtualtourist or tripadvisor will more than likely give you better results.  And you know why?  Because that's their sole purpose.  It's about travel.  The people there have experience of the destination in question, whether it be as tourists or locals.  **You are virtually guaranteed an answer and some useful information**, where with Reddit, you run a large risk of not actually getting the information you want or even misinformation.  This could be because you request is voted down; people are apathetic and some people just like to screw with you because it's ""funny"".  

This whole submission is a perfect example.  If you had posted this question on a tourist / travel specific site (or perhaps even a subreddit), maybe you would have received the info they require much earlier.  

But as it is, nothing.    In other words, if you use the appropriate platform, you will get results.   Using an incorrect platform will give you nothing, and knowing Reddit, you will even get less than that!   
 
**Edit** PS:  I'm not trying to give you a hard time,  but just take a look at these if you have the time -

I do not blame modern germans for anything, i blame there government for making the entire situation reach critical levels. I blame them for spreading racist and sterotypes of greeks into the media so they can brainwash the german people into believing the greeks deserve to be punished, even going so far as to have a German politican of Greek origin resign in disgust at the levels of racism in German politics . .  but I mainly blame them for NOT thinking LONG TERM. 

There was/is no need for harsh austerity in Greece or Cyprus or anywhere else for that matter but specifically Greece. It has created chaos and things like Golden Dawn now exist because of it. Instead of having a 10 even 20 year goal for Greece/Portugal/Cyprus to reform, they have decided to destroy the economy which as of now has unknown future consequences. 

Maybe when you can fucking see that Germany is NOT always right and they are in fact making things Worst, maybe you will understand where I coming from.

There is almost a 99% chance Greece will leave the Euro now because of how Germany dis-honored the greeks, by forcing this bail-out, by forcing stereotypes and racism and then continuing to push for even MORE austerity(finance minister of Greece publicly said today that he is ready to quit his position due to Troika continued harsh demands).

Germany could have been a great leader, but they decided not to be because they want to run Europe like a business, putting profits above all human costs . . . and Greece is tired of there shit.

&gt;Maybe the social model being put forth by the EU is not really going to be better than it was and is a free fall from here.

Oh, come on, why are you always this pessimist? We are where we are because of the mess our governments have done, and now that we're trying to reform things, ""bwaa we're in free fall"".

Yeah, fuck the rich! How dare them be rich? Everything was fine and dandy till they came along and lobbied our government to go on a spending spree! The least they could have done was ask them to also levy the taxes required for the things they were doing! But no, fucking rich people who wanted something for nothing from the state, it was them that made our government spend what it didn't have and now we're all paying for it!

They could abolish all trade barriers and still be highly protectionist just from the fact that they're constantly devaluing their currency.

Also, you are saying that there is a puppe prime minister -yet failing to mention that Tsipras lost the elections fair and square. 

Yet you blame the Germans. It you want to quit the EU - quit. However, the Greeks do not want to, something you pretend to ignore, and keep blaming the Germans for. 

Please adress this. Why are you blaming the Germans for Greece being in the Eurozone, when a majority of the Greeks wants to stay? Why are you pretending there was no free elections last June?

Honestly, you are just so childish. You must be very young, I imagine in high school. Honestly, we notice when you ignore facts and make up truths of your own. 

So, no, you have no valid base for your claim that there was no elections and that the Greeks do not want the Euro. Provide me with credible proof, otherwise you are lying to suit your world view. 

&gt;I do not blame modern germans for anything, i blame there government for making the entire situation reach critical levels. I blame them for spreading racist and sterotypes of greeks into the media so they can brainwash the german people into believing the greeks deserve to be punished, even going so far as to have a German politican of Greek origin resign in disgust at the levels of racism in German politics . . but I mainly blame them for NOT thinking LONG TERM. 

&gt;There was/is no need for harsh austerity in Greece or Cyprus or anywhere else for that matter but specifically Greece. It has created chaos and things like Golden Dawn now exist because of it. Instead of having a 10 even 20 year goal for Greece/Portugal/Cyprus to reform, they have decided to destroy the economy which as of now has unknown future consequences. 

&gt;The germans started this economic war

&gt; germany is not going to bully Greece for much longer.

Yes, you seem to blame them for pretty much everything. I think it is sad, tragic and pathetic that you can not see what you are doing. 

Why did you vote yes to the EU and the Eurozone? Why are you so corrupt? Why have you failed to build thriving industries? Why did you cheat? Why did you borrow so much money? Why is your productivity so low etc etc? 

There are a million questions to ask, but you are just concentrating on Germany. The fact is that Greece is mainly responsible for the situation they are in, but you do not seem to understand even basic economic thinking - like if a state borrows to much they will eventually have to pay back. However, I am sure you will find a way to blame that on the Germans too.

&gt;Maybe when you can fucking see that Germany is NOT always right and they are in fact making things Worst, maybe you will understand where I coming from.

If you had actually read anything I wrote in any other threads, you would know that I am one of the Euros hardest criticts and as late as today wished (OK, not wished, since I do not wish for devestation for millions, perhaps see it as a necessity) for its end, or at the very least, a huge reduction of the countries in the EZ. . However, you are not critiscising it  or are even up for any form of real discussion - you are a hateful Greek person who denies facts and blame it all on the Germans. As soon as you actually begin to see reason, see your own role and stop being a racist we can discuss.

&gt;by forcing this bail-out, by forcing stereotypes and racism and then continuing to push for even MORE austerity(finance minister of Greece publicly said today that he is ready to quit his position due to Troika continued harsh demands).

It is not forced if the majority of the Greeks vote yes. You convently forgets that, don't you? So, are you saying that the polls are fake? 

Racism - yes, I love all the Nazi sterotype you spreads around the place. Honestly, as a non German I can see that they are on the receiving end far more than you guys are, not that you care about facts. 

&gt;and Greece is tired of there shit.

&gt; I blame them for spreading racist and sterotypes of greeks into the media so they can brainwash the german people into believing the greeks deserve to be punished

That is not happening. Yes, there are occasional inappropriate remarks (sometimes even by members of government), but those are fringe sentiments that should be taken as seriously as we take the Hitler mustaches. And this brainwashing thing is surprisingly difficult to pull off on a democracy. 

&gt; even going so far as to have a German politican of Greek origin resign in disgust at the levels of racism in German politics 

He was member of a fringe party, and he is a thief. I would not take this too seriously. 

&gt;. . but I mainly blame them for NOT thinking LONG TERM. 
&gt; There was/is no need for harsh austerity in Greece or Cyprus or anywhere else for that matter but specifically Greece. 

Cyprus, I disagree. If your countries business model is based on dodgy banking umpteen time bigger than normal GDP, there is not much sympathy when that fails and has to be cut back. And the Cypriot government lost all the rest of my respect when they changed the conditions of the bail-in to include small savings accounts (in order to preserve the shady banking business) and then blamed Berlin. That was seriously not cool.

For the rest of the periphery, the situation is different. There are certainly economic misalignments in the ""South"" (e.g., housing bubble in Spain). These countries need to fix their national budgets, there can be no doubt about it. This probably also means cutbacks on stuff the country can not afford. I agree that austerity is a stupid idea and obviously does not work. But you also need to see that it is virtually impossible to do the alternative: massive permanent monetary transfers into the south. Especially now, in an election year, and against the backdrop of certain undeniable sins (high corruption, this whole taxi license thing, some workers retiring at 50, massive tax evasion, the cooked books when it came to joining the Euro) AND the existing stereotypes. NB I'm not saying that ""the Greek"" (or the Spanish, Portuguese, ...) are lazy and want a freebie.

Maybe we can have the ""Marshal plan for the South"" after the elections.

&gt; hey are in fact making things Worst, maybe you will understand where I coming from.

In our defense, you should never blame on bad intent what you also can blame on incompetence. The idea that a situation like this demands expansionary policy is pretty unpopular, even in the US. That's a worldwide phenomenon. 

&gt; There is almost a 99% chance Greece will leave the Euro now because of how Germany dis-honored the greeks, by forcing this bail-out, by forcing stereotypes and racism and then continuing to push for even MORE austerity(finance minister of Greece publicly said today that he is ready to quit his position due to Troika continued harsh demands).

The bailout was not forced. Greece asked for help, and there were conditions attached to getting it. Technically, you could have said ""no"". Also, I don't think you will leave.  

&gt; Germany could have been a great leader, but they decided not to be because they want to run Europe like a business, putting profits above all human costs . . . and Greece is tired of there shit. 

We don't want to lead. We want to sell you our stuff and come for vacation. The last time we ""lead"" the continent, we came withing viewing distance of Moscow. We don't want to lead. Really. 

By the way, the idea that the southern economies are intentionally destroyed is pretty stupid. Right now, the German economy is suffering because the people in the south are to poor to buy our stuff. 

Moreover, you are so focused on Germany, you completely forget that there are other ""creditor"" countries. Finland got an extra clause in the first (or second? not sure) Greek bailout, and from what I've gathered, all this lending money is even less popular in Denmark or the Netherlands. But for some reason, it's always ze evil German's fault...

Ok, long post ten comments deep. So basically, it's just for you. My points I hope you take from this, or at least consider:

* We don't hate the Greek.
* Not all Germans agree on current policy
* There is no intentional destruction of the south going on. Would be a net loss for us.

Also, yes, the Eurozone countries should not have let you in- however, that does not answer the question why you cheated and falsified records. Honestly - other countries overlooked, but the Greeks choose to falsify and cheat. Why ddi you do that? Why were you not honest? Why do you elect dishonest politician. 


&gt;You will never see a nazi sterotype of germans in any greek media, even the trashy tabloids.

Now I know you are  a troll. Thank you!

I must say, you are good at keeping it up. I will warn others though, so get a new identity.
