true,uututhrwa,null,null,"LAOS was a circus not exreme-right-wing. First off they had black people, and an openly gay greek-phillipino with an attitude (now that's how you describe Psinakis to those not in the know). 

They didn't have neither a hate message or even a clear message, they were really just trying to get votes (or the parliament money, or to sell books) by the ""patriotic"" part of the greek society.

On top of that their leader (and probably the whole gang) had a secret dream of establishing their ""political legitimacy"", instead of being those that sell the encyclopedia of ancient greek ufos on tv. And to probably deal with the greek shipping magnates and that bullshit. 

They also weren't all ""populist"", adonis and voridis went straight to ND for example, but Karatzaferis himself was something like, a moderate Republican, that's how he wanted to appear, and why he sided with the first ""coalition"". 

And that's where he misunderstood what his voters wanted, they wanted a ""rightist Andreas Papandreou"", and the most extreme of them wanted the kind of thing that Golden Dawn is. So they all left to vote Golden Dawn. And then Karatzaferis saw this and started some completely absurd bs about ""the Jews"" and went all anti - Troika, in case he could get the sheep back.

The thing I'd like to add though, is that among the things that fueled the Golden Dawn rise, which by 50% was due to LAOS collapsing, it was also that sentiment of like ""attacking politicians with eggs"", calling them ""traitors"", the vulgarity and subtle encouragement of extremism from Lazopoulos etc. , some people from syriza saw this as a campaign that would get the proletariat away from the big established parties. Except if you go and tell this stuff to the 20% that secretly were ok or even admired the fucking junta, the first thing they'll do is to abandon the ""lighthearded"" LAOS and openly support Golden Dawn.

I think Syriza have now changed their tactics, when they realized what had been done, they initially tried to do the normal thing of pointing out how the GD doesn't respect human rights, doesn't respect democracy etc. etc. except the 20% dickheads were actually getting turned on by exactly that, how anti establishment disrespectful and open about bringing back the junta etc. the Golden Dawn are. So now Syriza is getting more passive aggressive on purpose with the Golden Dawn, with all those ""hilarious"" stories about the GD ""shouting Heil Hitler in the parliament"", or ""punching a 12 year old"", it's like with those stories, the GD are disrespectful, but ridiculous at the same time, so if the Golden Dawn tries to use it to boast to their sheep about being anti estamblishement, well they can't because they'll look like clowns.  If you ""shout Heil Hitler"" in the parliament you aren't antiestablishment you're a lunatic. 

I am not sure if this is going to work on its own but from the very beginning I believed that to stop the Golden Dawn you need to ridicule it and not attack it as an ""enemy of democracy"", once that's out of the way and civil war and shit is not in the picture then get KNAT to pick some easy targets for a thorough beating.",0,1368855027,null,0,false,0,ca123k7,t3_1eifad,t1_ca123k7,t1_ca0srr1,null,1431118554,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,anocrazybear,null,null,"La ""FreeBOX"", est une espèce de routeur avec wifi, sur lequel tu vas brancher ton télephone fixe, ton portable/laptop, ton mobile via wifi, ta télé [et éventuellement abonnement câble]. Chaque opérateur donne un nom à sa box: chez Orange c'est LiveBox, chez Bouygues c'est ""BBox"", chez SFR c'est ""SFRBox"", chez Numéricable c'est ""LaBox"".

Dans le cas de Free on te la met à disposition, mais tu dois la rendre. D'autres opérateurs peuvent te la louer. L'avantage est bien sûr que c'est à ton Fournisseur d’Accès Internet [FAI] de te la réparer.

En ce qui concerne les mobiles, Free n'est pas le seul à proposer des forfaits sans engagement, ainsi [B and You s'acossie à Bouygues fait presque la même offre](https://www.b-and-you.fr/forfaits.html). SFR a un forfait [RED qui fait la même chose](http://www.sfr.fr/telephonie-mobile/series-red-de-sfr.html#sfrintid=V_nav_mob_serie-red&amp;sfrclicid=V_nav_mob_serie-red). 

Par contre en ce qui concerne les forfaits internet ""BOX"", sans engagement, il y a une différence très importante pour ton cas par rapport aux forfaits sans engagement pour mobile.: ils contiennent des **frais de résiliation** de 50€. C'est le cas de Free avec la Freebox, donc si tu veux acheter le forfait Freebox avec le Freemobile, faut prendre en compte cela dans ton calcul. Je pense que Darty [qui n'est pas un opérateur, mais un distributeur, genre Wallmart en plus cher), ne fait pas payer de frais, mais s'il te taxe 5€ de plus par mois que Free, ça revient au même.

Ich finde es schade, dass viele mittlerweile Islam mit Menschenrechtsverletzungen und Diskriminierung gleichsetzen. Gerade an vielen Muslimen in Deutschland (aber, ernsthaft, auch an vielen in primär islamischen Ländern) sieht man, dass Islam so vielseitig ist wie jede andere Religion und dass es an den Individuen liegt, ihre Religion und Kultur kreativ auszugestalten und Gleichberechtigung zu schaffen, Übernahme der westlichen Kulturen gar nicht nötig.

true,timoleon,FRNK,Franken,"&gt;Warum muss die EU immer gleich mit Verboten reagieren statt mit vorgaben und kontrollen?!

Egal ob Vorgaben, Kontrollen oder Verbote der EU:

all diese bürokratischen Maßnahmen sind beim Olivenöl gleichermaßen wirkungslos, denn hier werden seit Jahren im großen Stil die Verbraucher betrogen. Teilweise mit Billigung der EU, siehe http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivenöl

&gt;Wahrscheinlich ist nur ein Zehntel der geernteten Oliven geeignet, Spitzenqualitäten an nativen Ölen hervorzubringen. Nichtsdestotrotz weisen die meisten in Deutschland verkauften Flaschen und Dosen den Aufdruck „extra nativ“ auf. Dies lässt sich nur aus der Verwendung illegal teilraffinierter desodorierter Öle, wie etwa Lampantöle erklären. Darüber hinaus dürften Öle aus Ländern, die traditionell eine niedrige Qualität produziert haben, unter falscher Herkunftsangabe auf den Markt gebracht werden. 

&gt;Große italienische Unternehmen, die ihre minderwertigen Öle weiterhin mit „extra vergine“ bezeichnen, und die bei Tests durchgefallen sind, verklagen diese inzwischen vor Gerichten wegen „Störung der Gewerbe- und Handelsfreiheit“ oder gar „Amtsmissbrauch“.

&gt;Trotz aller Maßnahmen berichtete der Spiegel Ende 2011 mit Verweis auf die italienische Zeitung ""La Repubblica"", dass 80 Prozent des italienischen Olivenöls nicht aus Italien stamme, sondern in Italien nur etwas aufbereitet werde. Hinweise, dass eine Mischung vorliege, würden auf dem Etikett versteckt oder sogar verschwiegen.

&gt;Spanien ist der größte Hersteller von Olivenöl, Italien jedoch der größte Exporteur. Italienische Firmen kaufen in der ganzen Mittelmeerregion Olivenöl auf, füllen es ab, und vertreiben es dann weltweit. So wird griechisches Olivenöl aufgekauft, um es in Deutschland als „italienisches“ zu verkaufen, da die Bereitschaft der Konsumenten dafür mehr zu zahlen, größer ist. Bei der Abfüllung in Italien wird häufig griechisches Olivenöl guter Qualität nicht mit ebenso gutem, sondern mit minderwertigem italienischen Olivenöl gemischt und in Deutschland verkauft

**Art Museums in Barcelona**

MNAC- Large, lots of Romanesque art.  If you're planning to hit El Prado/La Reina Sofia in Madrid, you can probably give it a miss.

MEAM- Small, around the corner from Picasso.  I found it to be fascinating, with a lot of contemporary modernist art.  Highly recommended.

MACBA - Neat building, their displays are fairly standard modern art.

CCCB- Truth be told, I couldn't get through this building.  The display I went to was gave me so many bad vibes that I got claustrophobic and left.  I have no idea if that's good or bad.

Picasso Museum- I was severely let down.  Expect blank walls with his painting stuck on them.  There's very little about him or his inspirations.  It's almost guaranteed to full of tourists as well.

Joan Miro - Neat building, more modern art.  The mercury fountain is super cool, but the rest is just Miro's signature squiggles.  Pass.

Andrew Tapies - More modern art, none of it particularly exciting.  When I went they had a projector playing [Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal%C3%B2,_or_the_120_Days_of_Sodom) which made the women I was with rather unhappy.  I'd give it a pass.

Museu de Modernisme Catala - A little pricey for my tastes, but of very high quality.  It houses some excellent paintings and beautiful furniture.  Recommended.

**Non-Art Museums in Barcelona**

Museu de Historia de la Ciutat- History of the city, from when it was the Roman town ""Barcino"" to the modern day.  You get to go below the street level and walk through Roman ruins, which is a little creepy but very cool.  It ended kind of abruptly once it hit the 1800's though, which made me a little sad.  Still recommended.

Museu Maritim- When I went it was mostly shut down for maintenance.  Apparently it's reopened though?  I know very little of it.

Museu del Mamut- A small, slightly cheesy museum with a lot of great ice-age information.  Also you get to touch mammoth tusks.  Recommended, but with one caveat: It's all in spanish or catalan, so if you want to read any of the information posted, you'll need to be fluent in one of those.

Museu Xocolata- One of my favorites, it's a small museum full of the history of chocolate, chocolate-making tools, and chocolate statues.  They have [frequent classes on a variety of subjects](http://www.museuxocolata.cat/activitats_obertes.php) and if your schedule matches up, I'd definitely recommend going.  Oh, and did I mention the museum ticket is a bar of dark chocolate?  Highly recommended.

**Museums in Catalunya**

Theatre-Museum Dali, Figueres - Dali converted an old theater into a bizarre museum to ""contain the enigmas of Dali.""  Absolutely top-notch.  Be sure you don't miss the display of his jewelry.  You have to go outside and around the corner.  Also it *will* be full of French schoolchildren.  I don't know why, but they seem to love this place.  Highly recommended.

Casa Dali, Port Lligat- This one is kind of a pain to reach, but definitely worth it.  See the villa that Dali built, and step inside his home life.  It's  about as nutty as you would expect.  It's pretty much a must to purchase tickets in advance.  Highly recommended.

Castelle Gala Dali, Pubol - The final corner of the Dali Triangle.  It's also a pain to reach, but you can take the bus from the lovely city of Girona, and then walk a mile.  It's an old 11th century castle Dali bought and turned into a house for Gala.  It's also where he lived after her death.  I found the place kind of depressing.  It's got all of Dali's weirdness, but none of the energy present in the other two places.  Not certain I'd recommend it for any but the big Dali fans.

-As a brief aside, La Reina Sofia in Madrid is doing an absolutely fantastic Dali exhibition right now.  I highly recommend it if you're into that sort of thing.

A good example is UKIP's immigration policy, which requires any immigrants to be fluent in English... even though that is one of the 4 ""local"" languages in the UK.

So in many years more highly qualified people leave the country than move to Germany (BAMF).

So I think Germany has to ask itself why other countries are more attractive for qualified immigrants. In this respect Germany is below OECD average and Britain for example is close to 50%.

In my opinion this is not because Germany is not a friendly, welcoming and tolerant country. Maybe it is the language that gives countries such as England, Ireland, Australia and Canada an advantage.

Warst du schonmal in den USA, oder in Deutschland? Natürlich versuchen die Kirchen, Einfluss zu nehmen. Hierzulande sitzen sie in diversen Ethikräten, in jeder größeren Partei gibt es organisierte Christengruppen, und einige kirchliche Würdenträger werden vom Staat bezahlt. 

Natürlich sind wir heute weit davon entfernt, in einem Gottesstaat zu leben. Die Kirchen haben im Vergleich zu den letzten Jahrhunderten deutlich an Einfluss verloren. Aber wessen Verdienst ist das? Sicher nicht der der Kirchen, die haben ihre Privilegien alles andere als freiwillig einschränken lassen.

true,Flowers_Onions,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;These are not things set down by providence. Europeans were African before they were Europeans. South Americans were European before they were South Americans. Peoples aren't constant.

I don't like using these extremes. And even longer time before that we all were ""monkeys"" so what?

&gt;Ok, but that's not a scientific system of classification.

That is absolutely irrelevant here.

&gt;I mean, if you want to talk about atrocities, Europe is chock full of them. Germany almost committed complete genocide on the Jews; Portugal transported slaves like they were cattle; Spain burnt alive people at the stake.
&gt;Turkey and the Ottomans do have a Christian history, even if that history is pacifying the native population. But let's not even go that after; the Ottoman leader appointed the head of the Orthodox Church after the invasion because the Ottomans saw themselves as the heirs of Rome by right of conquest (Does the word Rûm sound familiar?).

Attrocities commited either by Europe or Ottomans are not the case, it's their connection to christianity. Just because they proclaimed themselfs to be heirs of Rome doesn't mean they were. It's incredibly silly to think that a muslim would ever be accepted by any christian as head of his church.

&gt;I mean, you're already making exceptions but don't make one for Turkey? Turkey is categorically denied the honor of being European, but Cyprus and Kosovo are? Kosovo's Muslim you know. Perhaps a candidate for the EU in the future.

Honestly, I don't really see Kosovo or Alabania as European European. But they're white and have big christian populations. Turkey is not white, not christian and as I said just because they conquered Thrace doesn't mean they get to call themselfs European.

&gt;But you do have a point. But you know what the largest Turkish city is? Istanbul (aka Constantinople) with 13m. Surely we can at least agree that those Turks that live in Thrace and have lived there for centuries are European, no?

Doesn't matter how big the population is. No, I don't consider them European. They're not white and don't have christian background.

The sad truth is that ERC is leftwing in name alone (they have leftwing social policies, but so did Mussolini) and la CUP should actually read a bit more into the works of Marx, Engels, Trotsky, Andreu Nin (a catalan by the way), as true marxism doesn't believe in the concept of frontiers.

Sorry, that's utter bullshit. if you put all policies in second place, and you form a pact (so CiU can govern) on the only base you have in common (nationalism), then your socio-economic policies mean shit. The pact isn't necessary for having a referendum. There's forty years now with nationalists in the government, not a single time one put forward in el Parlament that referendum, so a vote can take place. I think that says a lot.

Man muss endlich aufhören daran zu glauben, dass es sich bei dem Islam um etwas ähnliches wie den Buddhismus handelt. Die eingangs beschriebenen Dinge sind direkte Folgen einer Islamisierung, es ist ja nicht so, dass die Menschen sich plötzlich denken ""Nun, da wir frei sind, können wir ja ruhig wieder die Frau zur Sklavin des Mannes machen u.ä.""

Die einzige Rechtfertigung für derart rückwärtsgewandtes Denken liefert der Koran als Wort einer Gottheit, daneben vielleicht noch Mein Kampf, ansonsten sieht es aber mau aus was die Rechtfertigung zur Einführung idiologisch bedingter Menschenverfolgung und Grundrechtsverletzung angeht. 

Dies wird völlig bedenkenlos geleugnet. Was man den Menschen in den betroffenen Regionen, insbesondere den atheistischen oder anders Abergläubigen, Homosexuellen und Frauen antut, spottet jeder Beschreibung. 

Ständig wird als Grund für Kriegseinsätze eine Menschenrechtsverletzung angegeben, sobald es aber im Namen des Islam auf revolutionärem Wege geschieht, ist das natürlich ganz was anderes und muss hofiert werden.

Daher, 1 Land nennen in welchem eine Islamisierung nicht negative Folgen für die Bevölkerung hatte.

Und zu den Kirchen: Halten Sie mich bloß nicht für einen Spinner der christlichen Rechten, die mit Argumenten wie ""Kirchenbau in der Türkei weil die das hier ja auch dürfen"" argumentieren. 

Kirchen haben in Deutschland und weltweit zu viel Einfluss und denen gehört auch jegliche staatlichen Unterstützung gestrichen, aber denen wird bei jedem Anflug von Größenwahn sofort durch aufgeklärte Bürger entgegengetreten, während genau die selben Leute, sobald es sich denn um den Islam handelt, gar nicht mehr aufhören können mehr Rechte und mehr Toleranz einzufordern.

Aberglaube ist eine Privatsache und sollte durch den Staat als solche behandelt werden. Sprich keine ""Islamkonferenz,"" keine Papstrede im Bundestag, nichts dergleichen. Nur indem dem Aberglauben eine Platform geliefert wird, hat er überhaupt die Möglichkeit sich weiter zu verbreiten und an Einfluss zu gewinnen.

&gt;Una delle critiche riguarda l'efficacia comparativa dei risultati conseguiti dagli allievi nelle diverse realtà, a seguito di irregolarità nella somministrazione dei test. Il sociologo Luca Ricolfi, ad esempio, ha valutato le percentuali di irregolarità nella somministrazione in base a quelle che definisce come diverse aree geopolitiche, ravvisando differenze che si ripercuotono pesantemente sulla genuinità e la comparabilità dei risultati: nell'effettuazione delle prove, l'intromissione di docenti ""compiacenti"" nei confronti degli allievi raggiungerebbe percentuali più alte nelle scuole dell'Italia centro-meridionale (20%, con una punta di quasi il 30% in Calabria, Sicilia e Campania"") rispetto alle aree settentrionali del paese (tra il 2 e il 5%). L'alterazione indotta sul test da simili comportamenti vanificherebbe quindi la possibilità di utilizzarne i risultati in un'ottica comparativa. Lo stesso Ricolfi ha suggerito che, prendendo spunto da quanto succede in altri paesi europei, i test siano gestiti e somministrati da personale dell'Invalsi, che dovrebbe dotarsi allo scopo di una ""rete nazionale di rilevatori professionisti"", un'opzione i cui costi sono definiti non faraonici dal proponente.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;posh and aloof and so absurdly arrogant it's almost comical

You are generalizing, but I realize it's hard to discuss this topic without and I'll probably have to do it, too. On the flipside to your statement, I often hear Germans call US Americans very superficial (sometimes even disrespectful) after talking with them (which surely is equally generalizing and stereotypical, but I think there is some truth behind what we now both said).

My theory as an unprofessional: Generally speaking Germans don't change their residence even close as much as US Americans in their livetime ([11.7](http://www.mahalo.com/answers/how-many-homes-does-the-average-american-live-in-during-hisher-lifetime) times vs. [3.4](http://www.mieterverein-koeln.de/Umzugsverhalten_der_Deutschen) times on average). It's not uncommon at all to die in the same village or city where you've been born and your family lived for two or more generations. It's obviously harder for a newcomer to be accepted to a closed community like a village, where almost everybody knows everybody and their parents since they live. Being a newcomer is not exclusive in this case for foreigners from other countries, but to everyone moving in. A friend of mine came from East Germany and as he states it, it took many years for him to finally feel really accepted - most Americans that come here don't stay that long though. It's not that we don't want to get to know new friends, but we generally would never consider someone a friend we've just met a few times but just an acquaintance.

On top of that there is also a language barrier that you should take into consideration:

&gt;Germans less fluent in the English language often answer questions very briefly (one or two words) because they feel uncertain how to create a complete English sentence. This might sometimes appear impolite but is not at all meant this way.

There also is a different tradition of what is appropriate to say when talking:

&gt;More important, the German sense of ""politeness"" differs significantly from the Anglo-American concept of courteous remarks, small talk and political correctness. Germans highly value honesty, straight talking, being able to **cope with criticism and generally not wasting other people's time**. Consequently, business meetings tend to lack the introductory chit-chat. The Germans tend to be very formal people (especially in business) and titles rule the roost. Any titles (such as Dr., Prof. etc.) are used recursively, e.g. Herr Prof. Dr. Müller. Some colleagues that have worked together for many years still call each by their title and surname. When a German introduces himself to you, he/she will often simply state their surname, prompting you to call them ""Mr/Mrs..."". Using first names immediately may be seen as derogatory.


&gt;There is also a strong desire to achieve mutual agreement and compromise. [...] If you are around people you know well, sarcasm and irony are very common kinds of humor. Nevertheless, being ironic or sarcastic with your boss or professor is considered very inappropriate

Another great way is to listen to music of course. To help understand a song without a direct translation (which often is not very challenging), type in the title and artist and ""paroles"", which means lyrics. Reading them will help improve your reading/writing skills, and also challenge you a lot.

Here is a playlist of my favorite French songs. 

http://open.spotify.com/user/viiiiina/playlist/54yjiStdZX6BzWpnbmZf8F

Here is another, smaller one. Mainly old songs.

http://open.spotify.com/user/viiiiina/playlist/084UkkNzN4GcCqUzt2NSyG

If you like rap, I can recommend MC Solaar, Sinik, 113 (or Rim-K/Mafia K1fry).

A tip for understanding French rap, and also streety French: they often say the words backwards. For instance, Rim-K's real name is Karim, but backwards (verlant) it becomes Rimka. Sefyu (another rapper that I don't like, but you might like some songs) is actually called Youssef. A famous Renaud song is Laisse béton, instead of Laisse tomber (er pronounced as é). 

Instead of pisser, you might say sépi, instead of briquet you might say québrit. Instead of saying ""je me fais chier"" meaning ""I'm bored"" (literally I am making myself shit) you might say ""je me fais iech"". 

What else might be useful to learn... Oh, you often won't pronounce the last consonant of words, like in briquet (bri-kai), or ""maintenant"" (main-te-nan). However, we often make a ""liaison"" if one word in a phrase ends with a silent consonant and the following words starts with a vowel. For instance, ""des enfants"" (of children, belonging to children) will have ""des"" being pronounced as ""dé"" by itself and then ""enfants"" being pronounced ""zen-fan"". 

As you become quite skilled, I'd recommend sketches by Coluche and Les Inconnus. In the meantime, I think that ""On n'est pas couchés"" on Europe 1 is a great radio talk-show that might help you get more used to hearing the language.

A small minority consciously cooperated with the military regime. The vast majority of the people lived in fear. A large segment of the population appeared complicit on the surface. Socialists, conservatives, it didn't matter. When you have to feed your children, you might do things that you wouldn't normally do. The same thing happened in Nazi Germany.

&gt; The tortures and exiles certainly did not apply to everyone, only to leftists.

I'm a bit surprised that you'd repeat something that's part of the neverending self-victimization narrative *of a portion* of the Left. It might sound like appealing to emotion, and it is certainly not provable using this medium of communication, but coming from a large family I happen to be acquainted with people that suffered much and *were not all* leftists. Being a centrist, a right-wing, or a liberal does not mean that you care less about human rights. As a matter of fact, there are leftists that have more conservative views on gay rights, for example, than liberals.

&gt; Voting is relaxed, therefore people are more likely to vote with their ideology and not tactically. 

Spend all day as a member of an electoral committee at a polling station and we'll talk about it again. No, they do not vote based on their ideology. That's why you see people that voted for KKE voting for GD. Being someone that spends a fair amount of time researching everything about *all* candidates in my electoral district (I couldn't care less about party lines), made it even worse for me.

&gt; Retorting poll data with anecdotal evidence. A new low, even for you.

Thanks, but now allow me to correct you. Retorting a shitty poll with leading questions and misguided translation of the results, with something of equal substance. 

&gt; I have a met a large-enough sample of people to have an idea. 

My ""evidence"", which was not presented as such, is ""anecdotal"". Your sampling, on the other hand, serves only as a way to amplify your argument. What can I say, it sounds fair. The difference is that I am able to understand where you're coming from, although I disagree, while you feel the urge to engage in ad hominem attacks.

&gt; Probability theory, you should look into it one of these days.

I did. As a matter of fact, I started with the chapter about representative samples of sufficient size.

&gt; I never said they suddenly became fascists; I'm saying that they already were fascists or at least close enough to fascism ideologically. 

See, that's our main difference. On the face of extremism, you take a static ""genetic"" approach, while I'm offering a dynamic ""interpretative"" one.

You're just uncritically adopting the rhetoric the PASOK came up with to vilify Syriza a couple of years ago. There is a long way between attacking politicians with eggs and stabbing immigrants with knives. I don't think the slope is as slippery as you present it.

When people say Golden Dawn is an enemy of democracy, they're creating a mental barrier between democracy and authoritarianism.

Also, Artur Mas, and the Pujols have money in switzerland, whether that comes from fraud (which I think it is, although not proven yet) or not, putting it in Switzerland (which is proven and admitted by at least Mas) is fraud and tax-avoidance. Then we have.

Wanting the independence should have to do with a feeling, not with economic arguments, because what would withhold Barcelona to claim independence afterwards then, or why would they have to pay for Tarragona? If it's not for a sense of identity, the transfer of money can be corrected (if wrong), because in the end that's socialism, those that have more pay more taxes, that's what happens in Finland, you know, the example Carod always used.

The people who move from KKE to GD and back to Syriza again certainly belong in your brand of apolitical people that follow no ideology. That does not mean that everyone is like them, or even the majority of people.

I'm not offering a ""genetic approach"". I'm just saying that all the dictatorships and Juntas played a part in shaping the people's belief system. Your ""dynamic"" approach treats humans as blank states that only respond to current events. That is why I accused you of ignoring the historical context.

Again, I was there, not as a student agitator (I’m a 51 year old businessman), but as interested and partisan observer.  This whole affair has been blown out of all proportion by various vested interests and at no stage was anyone in any danger at all. In fact tourists were stopping to watch rather than rush by in fear of their safety, whilst the assembled press either stood back and watched (the print media) or were right in amongst the huddle with cameras and mics pointed at Farage. You can see the distinctive tall figure of Raymond Buchanan in many of the “mob” shots both still and video.
  
 In my view the whole matter shows up UKIP for what they are; rank amateurs.  The time and venue of the press call was all over Twitter more than 24 hours before it started.  The pub was open to the public – I simply walked in past the two polis on the door and went up to the bar and ordered a pint while the media scrum was in full flow, all the time with a Yes badge clearly visible in my lapel.  When the bar manager decided he had had enough, UKIP could not do anything but leave.  They had no contingency plan at all. 
  
 While Farage was locked in I simply walked up to the pub door and stood beside the police and the UKIP people to earwig how they were going to sort it out.  (Wear a suit – it makes you invisible when there are loads of other suits.)  One lady was prepared to get her car to take him out, but it was parked at the St James Centre over a mile away.  It was at this point that the police simply had enough and decided to remove him in a van. I stood right next to the police officer as he radioed in to colleagues to arrange the van.
 During this time the protestors were all self marshalled to the west of the pub, ie up the hill. They could quite easily have kettled Farage had they wanted to given the weight of numbers, but they simply stood and waited until they got their chance to barrack Farage as he left.
  
 As for reports that folk tried to stop the van from leaving, yes, there was a half hearted attempt from “Rachel” in her wheelchair, but the police simply said something like “c’mon hen, oot the way” and she moved immediately. Of course still pictures don’t show that, they show a bunch of scruffy oiks in front of the van.
  
 The atmosphere at the demo was like a football match in the Scottish First Division, with a few songs, the odd “wanker” hand sign, but lots of laughter at the misfortune and disarray of the hapless UKIP folk.  Threatening? Naw. Fun? Absolutely. The best Thursday after work that I have had in ages.
 
Edit… Also, one of the main chants that the students were shouting was anti-capitalist, not anti -UKIP, pro-independence or anti-English.

No, but it is an example of where they haven't thought something through and are harming *local* British people; the 8,000+ people who speak Welsh as a first language (or 700,000 in total across the UK), 100,000ish fluent in Irish, 30,000 in Scots Gaelic, and 2,000 in Cornish.

Dialect, no. But the [Northern cities vowel shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_cities_vowel_shift) is a phonetic divergence that is fairly recent (19th century).

Also keep in mind that languages can also appear via language contact.

[Singlish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlish) is an English-based creole which similarly has its origins in the 19th century. [A video about it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG5Gr-rjEWY)

[Tok Pisin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tok_pisin) is another example of language on the rise which has its roots in English (although it might be a bit older).

I'm sure there are better examples of recent appearances I'm not aware of.

Example of something which is relatively hard to understand (Note, it is entirely fictional):

 ^(""The EBC plans to bring the crisis to a close in an exponential curve downwards. This will be achieved with debt mutualisation techniques such as has been tried by the BOS. More specifically this will be used with the creation of the debt mutualisation pact, written in accordance to the article 1.002 of the Lisbon Treaty and with reference to precedents established under the pact of Bonn. The President of the ECB and the Council of the European Union and the President of the European Commission shall meet together to discuss sovereign debt obligational ***BLAHBLAHBLAH***"")

I'm not knowledgable enough in jargon to make this as hard as I'd like to understand. The Euro crisis is a big issue and everything, but it gets enough coverage as is, and whilst it's important and everything, no one really wants to more about it. Well, at least I don't.

What's really interesting to me is the democratic deficit and the future of the EU in terms of federalisation. These things are definitely touched upon in the press, but not with nearly as much coverage as the Euro crisis and when it is discussed (in UK press) it's normally because of UKIP which means the coverage is inherently, odd.

They were quite different, oïl languages were influenced by Celt and Germanic languages, while oc languages were influenced by Latin languages. These differences carried to the speakers of the 2 groups and influenced their culture and values.  
This lasted until the 16th century, when the king ordered French (which had gained a lot of influence through the King and Paris) to be the mandatory language for law and administration in all of France. His goal was to reduce the influence of the Church by forcing it to switch to ""French"". The side effect was that the oc languages also died.  
At this point France was just recovering from the 100 years' war and the strong divisions that had weakened the kingdom.

Well, *you* seem to think they did.  

I find the opposite to be true.  The 'crisis' that has dragged since 2008 has shown us one thing: EU either needs to integrate or disintegrate, not stay in the middle-ground with the worst of both worlds.  The advantages that the EU and its offshoots bring to the average citizen are great enough that returning to a previous era is no longer desirable.  The recent downturn is the symptom of a flawed integration.  

Of course you will find many that disagree with me, but I hold the belief that the stage is now set for a successful integration (in some form) of several of the ""Northern"" continental EU states.  We need it most right now, and the individuals that I've discussed the topic with (in real life) seem firmly pro-integration.  This is likely because we don't give a crap about nationality.

If they mean that they don't have access to official documents in the Breton language, sure. But otherwise, there is no discrimination against someone who happens to speak a regional language. That was back in the day. Of all things, it's considered rather cool if someone can speak a regional language, especially in their own region. 

Living in Paris, there were Breton language classes in the public school. There are bilingual road signs in many areas. There are regional language news reports on cable channels or whatever. France isn't actively trying to suppress its regional languages anymore. It's mostly that the harm has been done already, so now there aren't enough regional language speakers for regional language medias to really exist. And sure, France isn't hard pressed in reviving these regional languages.

I think it's fairly sad, especially for languages which are particularly different to French, like Basque, Breton, Alsatian, Corsican..

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ich bin kein Mitglied der Partei und habe meinen eigenen Problempunkte mit der AfD, aber darum geht es nicht. Vielmehr möchte ich ein paar oft gelesene Kritikpunkte aufgreifen und widerlegen.

* 1. Die AfD hetzt gegen Südländer.

Zeige mir bitte jemand eine Quelle die das beweist. Ich denke da kochen einige Emotionen höher als sie müssten.

* 2. Die AfD kritisiert die Schuldengemeinschaft.

Absolut korrekt. Wenn ich meinen Haushalt nicht im Griff habe klopfe ich nicht an deine Tür und verlange dass du meine Schulden übernimmst.
Das gilt im Kleinen wie im Großen. Das ist keine Frage der Solidarität, das ist eine Frage des Selbstschutzes, der Leistungsgerechtigkeit und damit Fairness. Darüberhinaus sehe ich deutliche Anzeichen, dass der derzeitige Kurs die EU auseinander treibt. Das kann nicht im Sinne der Europäer sein. 

* 3. Das wahre Problem ist die Forderung nach Austerität. 

Dieser Irrglaube ist ein großes Problem. Staat auf Kredit ist eine der unsozialsten Praktiken die je angewandt wurden. Stellt euch vor ihr kauft euch ein neues Auto und stellt die Rechnung auf euer dreijähriges Kind aus. Das zahlt dann sobald es 18 ist. Jeder, wirklich jeder sieht den Wahnsinn in dieser Idee. Staatsschulden unterscheiden sich davon prinzipiell null.

Zusätzlich würde ein Ende der Austerität der Nehmerländer die sich im Wachstum begreifende Ablehnung der Geberländer in blanken Hass umwandeln. Wer eine Gefährdung der EU will, hier ist sie.

* 4. Die AfD ist nationalistisch

Polemisch und nicht richtig, die AfD will eine starke EU. Für eine starke EU braucht es starke Einzelstaaten. Sie versteht, dass ein zentralistisches Staatswesen nicht funktionieren kann, es noch nie hat und nie tun wird. Stattdessen setzt sie auf die bewährte Eigenverantwortung und friedlichen, kooperativen Wettbewerb zwischen den Staaten. 

* 5. Die AfD will die Südstaaten rausschmeißen

Nicht richtig, für mehr Details empfehle ich die zahlreichen Interviews mit Vertretern der AfD. Zusammenfassend möchte die AfD einen temporären Austritt von Staaten erlauben, damit diese so schnell wie möglich genesen.

To try and supplement the language of national institutions is an attack against the unity of a country. The adoption of the charter most certainly contributed to the situation in Spain.

It's interesting to see that the first place the president of the region of Catalonia went to seek political support is the US. He even signed a partnership agreement with the state of Massachusetts. 

Did you know Catalonia now has its own Ministry of Foreign Affairs ? The Secretary Senen Floreinsai i Paulau, who studied at the NY University after receiving a Fulbright scholarship. The Fulbright program was created in 1946, allegedly to favor cultural exchange, but in reality to develop a network of officials aligned with US interests. Recipients of Fulbright scholarships are frequently put under surveillance by counter-espionage services of the whole world and are considered as potential CIA agents. Look it up. 

Where was the first Catalonian embassy opened ? You guessed it, the US. And who was nominated as the first head of the delegation ? Andrew Davis, who graduated from universities in Great Britain and Washington.

Take a good hard look at what's been happening over the last 30 years: Divide and Conquer. Yugoslavia for instance, which was a unified country, was shattered, with NATO troops breaking up Serbia, creating Kosovo out of nothing. Did you know Kosovo is now one of most important US military base in the world ? It's a pseudo-independent state, it's in fact completely under US control.

Yugoslavia was the spearhead of the non-aligned countries under Tito, it's now reduced to nothingness.

The Soviet example, who do you think benefited from the disintegration of the USSR ? The USA who now have a foothold in Georgia (depends on the mood), in Ukraine, in Lithuania, in Latvia, in Estonia, which is now part of the EU construction.

At the same time, the EU's common defense policy is NATO. How peculiar. NATO was created in response to the very real threat of totalitarian communism. But now that the USSR no longer exists, NATO should dissolve, right ?

On the contrary, NATO still exists and has gotten bigger, with Eastern European states joining it even before joining the EU. Why ?

All of this is a classic example of divide and conquer. You break up states from the inside, those new micro-states are aligned with US+NATO=EU interests, [which is understandable since the EU and the Euro is an idea that came from US spy chiefs in the fifties.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1356047/Euro-federalists-financed-by-US-spy-chiefs.html)",0,1368897722,null,0,false,0,ca199ji,t3_1ekjz2,t1_ca199ji,t1_ca165u8,null,1431115105,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

The fact is that Golden Dawn and LAOS existed before last year's elections.

If I had to summarize my argument once more, I'd say that for most people, in the face of hardship, history is not omnipresent.

Might be just me but i'd rather a lot more people speak the same language.

There's a very good reason everybody learn english : because that way, everyone can understand each other. 

Even if french or german or whatever would be replaced by english, it wouldn't mean at all local culture would disappear. Only that everyone understand each other and a lot of things would have to be translated. 

People would just learn english first then their former local language as a second to understand ""old stuff"" if it wasn't translated.

I think the advantage of every european citizen understanding each other is well above the sentimental value those people would attribute to a language slowly replaced over centuries.

Btw, languages are ""alive"" because they are spoken. Not because some academician said ""USE THOSE EXACT WORDS OR ELSE..."". If people want to speak english instead of german or whatever in the end they'll do it anyway because they want to be able to understand each other. Whether you wan't it or not.  Languages ain't fixed and THEY WILL move toward english overtime. For a simple reason of practicality. For the same reason you say ""deja vu"" in english for example, while it's in fact a french expression.

A ""language"" is just a speaking-way variant from one region to another, but even look at borders between countries (like france and germany) where people speak a little of both and frequently even mix it in a single sentance. Because that's the way they speak, and a fact of life, and not because somebody decided to name it anything.

Because short of force brainwashing a few hundred millions people and/or use totalitarian surveillance and law enforcement (""speak the wrong way and to Guantanamo with you !"" like in north korea where even your hair cut is decided by state officials and if you disagree you get deported ?) you can't *force* them to speak only what you want to hear.

Münster: Get a bike and venture throughout the city, get an ice cream and walk through the Prinzipalmarkt, the city has beautiful architecture (churches, cathedrals, and other buildings) to enjoy, relax in one of the parks or near the Aasee.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; , but using only a lingua franca erodes too much.

Yes and now. That's why word are added to a language, and why it's *alive*. 
For example, try saying ""computer"" in latin without using any word more recent than a century. ""Thinking machine"" will probably be the closest approximation you can think of it, and it's not a word. Which is why latin is a *dead language*


When you miss a word, you add it. Generally from another language coming from another culture, which already refer to that item/concept/whatever. Then it might spreader easier because everyone is actually speaking the same language. People will have heard of it, or could acquire it in a more easy way.

Commonly used languages (live one) tend to pick up additional words that way, or even use multiple ones for a single things. Think colour/color.  One is english, the other an US one. Both are used, and both have a somewhat different cultural background even if vaguely. Still the same language, and none of them is blocked.

It would probably be the same with a few words varying from a country to another to reflect local habits; and wouldn't hamper too much or ""erode"" speech. 

People won't become dumb cavemen in the space in a few generations just because they have a common language, sorry.

true,c0mpufreak,null,null,"Alirhgt, to answer your actual question. I have worked for two big IT companies but have several friends that are working for other companies.

**Microsoft**

My current employer - in terms of employee satisfaction they constantly rank quite high and just recently got awarded an award from the ""Great Place to work"" institute ranking them first. The opportunities are endless as you'd expect from a global IT player.

**IBM**

Worked here for three years. Imo not as good as Microsoft but still a decent place to work. Lots of opportunities and great people to work with. Again, IBM is huge (25k employees in Germany alone), so you could do just about any IT related job there.

**Freudenberg IT**

Have heard good things about them. They do all kinds of stuff in the IT sector as well.

**VW**

Just take it as an example. About every major company in Germany will have their own IT departments and often offer solid salaries as well as steady hours (35hours/week for VW).

**Avantgarde**

They are a joint venture between Microsoft and Accenture. They are also supposed to be a nice place to work.

The list goes on and on. City wise I think that you'll likely find the big IT companies in Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Cologne. If you look for startups then Berlin is the place to be right now.

Of course, the local Zeman-hating media immediately assumed so, but it'd be rather weird for a person describing himself as a tolerant atheist and a democrat to discriminate against someone like that.

**2)** Also, Zeman supports same-sex civil unions - his own government [issued a bill](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registrovan%C3%A9_partnerstv%C3%AD) to recognise it in 2001 (unfortunately, the initiative was not succesful) - and [child adoption](http://www.zemannahrad.cz/t/nazory-milose-zemana.htm) for same-sex couples, so he clearly doesn't seem to be a homophobe.

**3)** Zeman says he doesn't want to humiliate Putna through publishing the true reason for his inaction. If that reason is Putna's sexuality, how do you humiliate a gay person by saying he's gay?

**4)** Situation like this is not that unprecedented. The previous president, Klaus, went so far with refusing to perfom some of the tasks he was supposed to, that he *didn't even sign some bills*, which a president is obliged to do. 
This was not presumed by the Czech legal framework, but the solution was found quickly - the role of the president in matters like that is purely ceremonial, so the lack of his signature does not prevent a bill from coming to force. So if Zeman doesn't perform this last step, Putna will probably be able to use the title, since the president's role here is also only ceremonial.",0,1368907029,null,0,false,0,ca1buy1,t3_1ekpuw,t1_ca1buy1,t3_1ekpuw,null,1431113813,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,kicker7955,ROMA,Romania,"The problem is the feeling of a representative democracy at the EU level, compared to the more connected feeling of a direct democracy we have at a national level.

Everything from individual laws to future policy is basically decided for the people. All we have is the trust that they will vote what is in all of our interest and considering Europes monarchic and imperialist roots that feeling isn't very comforting

More recently solutions became less obvious and the problem changed from ""What is the best course of action for all of us?"", and more, what is best for France or Germany(even England at one point), the little guys barely got a vote in. When you hear germans worrying about inflation and France about subsidies(while you have riots, unemployment and closed banks at home), you realize, your not a member of a club, your just the guy that had to be asked to the party. what else can you do but pick up your national problems and go home and try to solve them yourself.(because you caused them after all)

 I truly believe that most EU decisions are taken on good faith, and most of the news is politically bias. But I find that forcing unity and asking to ease the national autonomy(fiscal in this case) while not leading by example and putting a priority on your own national interest is wrong. 

I am all for an EU government(God knows my country needs somebody that knows how to actually govern). But would Germany actually respect and abide by a Greek cabinet? Would France ever enact a British Conservative's spending cuts?

Why not start with a common educational policy(Finnish policy for everyone), enforce infrastructure and large scale investments at a continental level, don't give greedy local politicians the chance to intermediate.

War is not a option, but neither is a true union at the moment, if you think the cracks between North and South are big you should check the disparity between East and West, it all looks good on paper but, the productivity and earning disparity is to great to be governed centrally.

I would like to end on a observation, the EU needs better PR, the local governments take credit for every good visible progress, while blaming unpopular decisions on European policies.",0,1368908416,null,0,false,0,ca1c8tz,t3_1ekwit,t1_ca1c8tz,t3_1ekwit,null,1431113632,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

However, often it's like a weird combination of intentionally funny, made up words and some really ""rednecky"" rural dialect, with occasional hilarious bonus coincidence (like ""szukać"") to me (and most Czechs and Slovaks I'd say).

""Zvyčajný"" in slovak means basically ""usual"", which by itself is not funny at all, but it just sounds silly used in this context. ""Nadzwyczajny"" sounds a lot like ""nezvyčajný"", which associates more to the professor having three legs or wearing a sombrero then ""not standard title"", if you know what I mean. You would never use it to describe a persons position in a hierarchy in slovak.

odchod - in Czech it means ""departure"" I think, in Polish - ""excrements""

mam napad -"" I've got an idea"" in Czech, ""I've got an attack"" in Polish (like heart attack)

veverečka - squirrel, but exactly as polish diminutive form

momentálně nepřítomný - in Czech it means something along ""I've gone and I'll be back soon"" in Polish it means ""immediately unconscious""

parek v rohliku - we'll just laugh our asses off if we hear this.

I think i try in fact to make a different one : Yes and no. 

- Translating a text or work in a language A to a language B does cause loss in meaning, subtility, subtext, etc. 

- But when you start speaking *fluently* another language, you start making it your own and find way to transfer the same meaning, informations. New words are one way to do it. Evolving grammar, etc too. Which is why a *live* language is important, *to allow new ways to transfer new meanings and limit/stop loss*.

That's the same difference between translating and adapting. The fluent speaker *adapt* his speach and ideas to the new languages. The level of success being a huge deal depend on how fluent said speaker is. 

Which is probably why english classes is important, to allow people to speak a good english (without feeling any need to suppress local language; imho both people prefer and would learn both which is probably the long term solution, english becoming dominant overtime and not forced).

That way, a fluent speaker would loose a lot less.",0,1368909322,null,0,false,0,ca1chs6,t3_1ekwit,t1_ca1chs6,t1_ca1cdb0,null,1431113514,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

First, congratulations for buying a bike. A complete class A certification costs around 1000 to 1500 EUR, depending on where you live. In eastern states is usually cheaper than in the west, since everything is cheaper there. I paid approx. 1300 EUR in Thüringen.

One important thing to remember: If you do a Class A Führerschein, you have to be at least 24 years old. If you're younger, you can only do A2. With A2, you're allowed to ride bikes up to 25 kW / 34 PS. So, if you want to buy a bike, please make sure that it's throttled. Ninja Edit: [Here's](http://www.kfz-auskunft.de/fuehrerschein/fahrerlaubnisverordnung.html) some information in German.

Bike registration is easy, but it's necessary to get an insurance first. They will give you a code which you need for registering the bike, and then you'll get your number plate. Tax is around 40 EUR per year, and insurance about 100 for a full year. But it's also possible to register for a few months per year, say from March to October.

The Fahrschule totally depends on your place of residence. Make sure to check out the prices. But even more important is being able to make a connection to your instructor, so don't just go for the cheapest.

Parking is usually not a problem, there's place everywhere and I never saw a bike having a ticket. Most of the places will have extra motorcycle parking lots, or you can just park near the doors.

And one more tipp: If you're planning to do some tricks, you should by the ""MARCO POLO Karten 1:200.000"" [\(example\)](http://shop.marcopolo.de/marco-polo/kartografie-atlanten/bayern-nord-marco-polo-karten-1200-000-laenderkarten_pid_740_252.html). You can get them at every book store, and they show some great routes and nice places to visit.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"Germany wouldn't be ""nothing"" without immigrants because it would still be a nation with a specific history and culture which it built without the help of immigrants. Of course it would be something. Saying it would be ""nothing"" is absolutely ludicrous. Immigrants didn't build Germany. And without them it would still be a nation with tens of millions of inhabitants, and it would still be economically important. Some say, and I do believe this, that massive immigration of unskilled workers is actually an economic and social burden. Japan, which has very few immigrants, is still the 3rd economic power without immigrants. I'm not saying they're not facing demographic difficulties, but they're not facing problems Germany is with massive immigration.

Otherwise, I never said Germany has a homogeneous culture. However, the different regions are comparatively extremely close, and form the nation that is Germany. Sorry to bust your fantasy, but two different German regions aren't as different as Iceland is to Somalia. They're highly similar and justifiably belong to the same nation, as they share a similar culture, history, language and drive.

true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"&gt;Germany wouldn't be ""nothing"" without immigrants because it would still be a nation with a specific history and culture which it built without the help of immigrants.

""Germany"" did not exist as a state until the 19th century. 

&gt;of course it would be something. Saying it would be ""nothing"" is absolutely ludicrous. Immigrants didn't build Germany.

It would be something but it certainly wouldn't be the Germany we know and love today. 

&gt;Some say, and I do believe this, that massive immigration of unskilled workers is actually an economic and social burden. 

Some say there's a secret underground civilization of reptiles waiting for the right moment to attack and take over the Earth. 

&gt;Japan, which has very few immigrants, is still the 3rd economic power without immigrants. 

Japan is actually one of the worst examples you can give of how well a nation without immigrants is doing

&gt; I'm not saying they're not facing demographic difficulties, but they're not facing problems Germany is with massive immigration.

You're right, they're facing a problem far, far worse. The inability of the state to support its massive population of old people. Immigration is, at this point in time, the only possible solution for the nation to avoid total collapse.

&gt;Otherwise, I never said Germany has a homogeneous culture. However, the different regions are comparatively extremely close, and form the nation that is Germany. 

In terms of culture and language they're not. France was in a similar position until the government decided to forcefully asimilate its minorities. 

&gt;Sorry to bust your fantasy, but two different German regions aren't as different as Iceland is to Somalia. They're highly similar and justifiably belong to the same nation, as they share a similar culture, history, language and drive.

That has more to do with economic prosperity than culture. 

&gt;Don't give me your Western self-hatred bullshit. I've heard that rhetoric since I was in kindergarten. It's official public school curriculum. I already know it by heart.

The way I see it, you have two options. You can either accept that immigration has been a reality since forever and that immigrants are a necessity unless you want to go the way of Japan or you can continue to spout your rhetoric until your lungs give in. Of course, this is all just for your own personal gratification. The world will just the same tomorrow and there's nothing you can do to change it.

&gt;""Germany"" did not exist as a state until the 19th century.

I know.. So what? That's not the point, is it? You people always focus on this. The culture, background, has existed for millenia. Germany as a country is an administrative result. Just like that piece of paper called ID paper is simply a piece of paper that is thrown out to everyone like some pez dispenser. It ultimately doesn't mean shit.

&gt;It would be something but it certainly wouldn't be the Germany we know and love today.

THANK YOU. That's all this was about. Germany would not be ""nothing"". But obviously, as a self-hating watchdog you just couldn't let the obvious go. And sorry, but I'm fairly sure that most of the world, when they visit Germany, they don't go to see the Turkish neighborhood. You may love it. Don't say ""we"".

&gt;Japan is actually one of the worst examples you can give of how well a nation without immigrants is doing

Actually, it's not. While it had a decline in the last decades, and ""OUCH"", turned out only as the 3rd economy in the world, many analysts agree that with its current government it's rising back up. There still is a huge demographic problem, but they chose to deal with it themselves, instead of replacing their population, and thus destroying their culture faster than slow demographics would.

&gt;In terms of culture and language they're not. France was in a similar position until the government decided to forcefully asimilate its minorities. 

In terms of culture, they are. i'm not saying the regional cultures are identical, I'm saying they're comparatively EXTREMELY close. It's normal for a country to have small variations of cultures. France, is much more diverse than Germany. Germany is practically homogeneous in comparison (again, I'm not saying it is, but comparatively, there's no debate to be had here).

&gt;That has more to do with economic prosperity than culture. 

No. 

&gt;The way I see it, you have two options. You can either accept that immigration has been a reality since forever and that immigrants are a necessity unless you want to go the way of Japan or you can continue to spout your rhetoric until your lungs give in. Of course, this is all just for your own personal gratification. The world will just the same tomorrow and there's nothing you can do to change it. 

Come live in the Paris suburb where I lived as a child. Just remember, don't eat during Ramadan, and tell your sister to cover her hair. And you need to take it, and not complain, cause that's the Europe ""we"" love.

It's basically just another signature on the marriage certificate by each witness, but still a nice gesture added to the ceremony.

If, of course, you opt for that the witnesses will have to properly identify themselves by passport/ID.

In no way, however, does the legality of the marriage have anything to do with the wedding's witnesses' capability to identify themselves (!). 

It might just be a problem to be a (formal, signing) witness if you don't bring the required identification; my guess would be that your brother wanted to make sure that the marriage registrar accepts whatever identification you bring.

Well, actually, yes it would be. It wouldn' exist. 

&gt;Actually, it's not. While it had a decline in the last decades, and ""OUCH"", turned out only as the 3rd economy in the world, many analysts agree that with its current government it's rising back up. There still is a huge demographic problem, but they chose to deal with it themselves, instead of replacing their population, and thus destroying their culture faster than slow demographics would.

The thing is, they can't deal with it themselves. The Japanese government has tried numerous things to increase the nation's birth rate, all to no avail. If Japan doesn't open up to immigration soon it will die. 

&gt;In terms of culture, they are. i'm not saying the regional cultures are identical, I'm saying they're comparatively EXTREMELY close. 

They weren't. 

&gt;It's normal for a country to have small variations of cultures. France, is much more diverse than Germany. 

What Germany has isn't ""small variations"". Neither was what France had. 

&gt;No. 

GDR?

I don't think you understand just what sort of impact immigration has had on Europe.

Alternatively, they'd have to do away with the welfare state.

true,anocrazybear,null,null,"I was thinking that maybe you can only use a mobile plan. 

You connect your mobile either to a Wifi hotspot, either through the 3G+ network in which case there is a 3GB threshold where the 3G+ internet speed is reduced [not on the SFR RED offer, where after your threshold, you are blocked, and you have to buy access for around 5€ per 250MB!].

So you won't have coverage pbs, for the 3G+ network, and I don't think that skype uses much data, but if you are near a wifi hotspot, it would be interesting to use it.

All that is left, is connecting your laptop to the internet. Here comes the trick: Free uses a method that checks for the sim of your phone. SFR uses an app on your smartphone to connect to the hotspot. So you can't connect your laptop directly to the wifi hotspot [This is **not** the case for the B &amp; You, since [they give you access codes for the wifi](https://assistance.b-and-you.fr/questions/9931-forfaits-comment-utiliser-le-reseau-hotspots-bouygues-telecom-wifi), but you need to check]. *This is used to make direct laptops connections to wifihotspots restricted for clients that buy Land Internet Acess*. 

The idea then, is to use something called **tethering**. Basically you turn your smartphone into a wifi hotspot, so that your laptop can connect to the internet via the mobile. This was usually made to be used when the smartphone is connected to the 3G+ network. In that case it will work whatever mobile plan provider  you choose, on the condition that your smartphone has this option.

You might wish to worry less about thresholds, by using the tethering, while your smartphone is connected to the wifi hotspot. I suspect that in the SFR case, since they are using a specific app, this isn't possible. For Free, it might be the case too, or there could be apps that unlock this, but it is less problematic that SFR. Because if you used tethering with 3G+ you won't be blocked once the threshold is met. 

While looking for a few links I found that there is even another provider for mobile plans called [SOSH, and it is the same price and logic as Free](http://shop.sosh.fr/forfaits-mobiles) ,with an app to connect to the Orange hotspot, and 3G speed reduced after threshold.

So, I would say that SFR is the last one to consider [because it blocks after 3GB of data]. In first place I would hesitate between B&amp;You [ with access codes for the wifi hotspot, so that you can connect your laptop without tethering and other nerdy things] and the SOSH, which uses the best network. And Free is  close [and they have access to the same Orange network than SOSH].

**Edit: forgot to check SOSH properly, they don't offer free calls to mobiles to the US [it comes as an extra option for 5€]. So Free is better for you than SOSH.**

PS: for territorial coverage, you can already check if there is hotspots near your future house. B and You uses the [Bouygues 3G+/Wifi network](http://www.corporate.bouyguestelecom.fr/notre-reseau/cartes-de-couverture-reseau). (switch between tabs). 

For ~~Free~~/Soch, the Orange 3G network is [here](http://couverture-reseau.orange.fr/france/netenmap.php), and more importantly their hotspot locations is [here](http://www.orange-wifi.com/fr/recherche_liste_hotspots_avancee.html). Free have acess to 3G+ network of Orange, but they have their own [FreeWifi Hotspots](http://www.freephonie.org/map/map.php).

true,uututhrwa,null,null,"&gt;When people say Golden Dawn is an enemy of democracy, they're creating a mental barrier between democracy and authoritarianism. That is meant to stop people from discrediting the ideology of democracy and moving to the other side. Democracy is not a given; if you allow people to uncritically discredit it, it will lose its weight and then we all lose.

I didn't say that the above it's wrong, I said the way you present it to certain groups in Greece will only make things worse.

&gt;Your revisionist version of history is disturbing.

It only happened 5 years ago, it's not revisionism, it's my take on what impression  LAOS gave and what they were really ""standing for"", and if you ask the man down the street, say not a strong leftist or from the political right, he'll more or less give the same description. 

That article tries to point out links between members of LAOS and the extreme right, and while many of them are true, everybody knows how LAOS operated, ""we're open to everyone who loves Greece"" (to get the votes) and once you're there you are supposed to adopt that ""proper"" ""nice"" (and kind of silly) ""patriotic"" attitude. Which was overall even more moderate than Lepen's party. There is no way they'd get Psinakis and Vana Mparmpa in there if they were that extreme, they aimed to appeal to the ""common folk"" not activists. There's also no way they'd go and be like ""the greek basketball team shouldn't have Schortsianitis or Adetokoumpo because they're black"" as Golden Dawn did, and as LePen implied (before the 1998 WC).

Their official stance on the immigration problem (which imo isn't even a problem outside a few neighbourhoods in Athens, in fact the real problem is how they get treated in Peloponisos) was that ""we need to draw a line on how many immigrants this country can support"". Compare that to Golden Dawn's version which is to butcher Muslims and put mines around the country's borders.

&gt;You're just uncritically adopting the rhetoric the PASOK came up with to vilify Syriza a couple of years ago. There is a long way between attacking politicians with eggs and stabbing immigrants with knives. I don't think the slope is as slippery as you present it.

I said that what Syriza did played a role. There is a slippery slope between this and being on a mission to vilify Syriza or necessarily having that opinion because PASOK gave it to me. Yes I think that Lazopoulos shit was responsible, and also responsible, the fact that instead of solving or acknowledging the problem in the few areas where it was actually happening, Syriza was calling everyone a racist, which led to Golden Dawn getting credibility and a core of non-completely-insane people that thought the Golden Dawn ""understood them better""

Off course what's happening in central Athens has a lot to do with real estate sharks and lathremporio or whatever they're called, and the crisis is an even bigger reason for the Golden Dawn rise, but the rest also played their role.

Woah there. It's been hovering at around 50% for years. You should wait for people to actually be confronted with the idea of voting for change, it almost never happens. The number who would actually vote to change especially considering most don't know what to think is most likely very low. UKIP is thriving off the group who say they'll vote OUT in 2017 but in reality are just saying so to piss off what they see as the ruling hegemony. They don't actually believe it they just want some political change. Were it to come down to it a portion of them would vote to stay in regardless of what they say. By 2017 they will have evaporated into the ether and we'll have a strong pro-EU vote.

In German I would say ""jein"", but unfortunately this does not exist in English ;-(

I think culture as in making movies, singing songs, wearing traditional dresses etc. won't change much *but* some parts of the culture have to change drastically in a fiscal union. 

We currently have a clash of culture about the stability of the Euro, many of those countries which were members of the Hanseatic League favour a hard currency, where some southern countries always had a culture of inflation. As long as this problem is not solved on a political level, a fiscal union will fail. 

This also includes the industrial culture: Does a country have a working industry or does it rely on tourism? Is there a working form of vocational education or not? Are there skilled labour?

What you need a flow chart for this or something? Two things happened

1) Golden Dawn got a core of voters in certain areas in Athens (this had already started before the crisis, and can in part be attributed to leftists forcing the idea that if you've got a problem you're a racist)

2) With that core around, and that general sentiment of ""burning down the parliament"", with the kremales and shit, and the whole Lazopoulos propaganda or motivation or whatever you'd call it, a great percent of LAOS and other parties voters started to feel that the Golden Dawn isn't an extreme and crazy party.

The fact that you didn't realize right away what I was referring to in each paragraph shows that you never even thought of it that way, your explanation is probably along the lines of ""it happened because it's a left over far right anti communist sentiment from the civil war"", yeah right LAOS was active for at least 10 years and we never saw the kind of things Golden Dawn does.",0,1368955236,null,0,1368955473,0,ca1ngup,t3_1eifad,t1_ca1ngup,t1_ca1neya,null,1431108271,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Ich behaupte gar nicht, dass derjenige, der sich nicht als Selbstmordattentäter hochjagt und seine Frau nicht schlägt kein Moslem ist. 

Das Problem ist doch, dass sich jeder Moslem der so handelt in völligem Einklang mit seiner Religion befindet. Das ist es doch, was derart harsch kritisiert wird. 

So lange niemand Ungläubige tötet oder gegen sonstige (Menschen-)Rechte verstößt, kann er sich alles nennen. Die Probleme beginnen dann, wenn der Aberglaube in seinen Rechtsvorschriften krasse Verletzungen der Rechte anderer als akzeptabel darstellt und teilweise sogar fordert(!)

Und hören Sie verflucht nochmal auf mich mit der christlichen Rechten in Verbindung zu bringen. Nur weil das Christentum Menschenrechtsverletzungen rechtfertigt, heißt das noch lange nicht, dass der Islam das deshalb auch dürfe. 

Was ist das überhaupt für eine Begründung?

Meiner Meinung nach ist Aberglaube in Form von Religion das Krebsgeschwür unserer Zivilisation.

Beide zu vergleichen zeugt einfach nur davon, auf welches Niveau die Islambefürworter die Debatte immer ziehen wollen. Aber es geht hier eben nicht um Glaube gegen Glaube, sondern um weltliche, durch die Gemeinschaft bestimmte Normen in Form unserer Gesetze gegen eine barbarische Ideologie aus dem Mittelalter.

I could say the very same thing about you.

I don't care how you see it, racially charged is a word I don't find important, it has no negative meaning for me, at least not in this case. I understand you might be little biased since you're from Puerto Rico.

&gt;No it's not. Words have meanings. Sociology and history aren't things in which you can throw around terms from the heart.

When you say ""European people"" you use it an euphemism for white people. And as I said million times before, just because Turks conquered Thrace this won't change.

&gt;I can just as easily say real Americans are white, and it'd make as much sense as what you're doing. I mean, you're saying Albania and Kosovo aren't European countries because they're not white?

America is the land of immigrants and their nationality is not based on ethinicity so you cannot. I never said Albania and Kosovo aren't white, read it again. 

&gt;Holy shit, race isn't that important, dude. Culture is.

In this case race, culture, history are all important.

And your second argument is that polemic rhetoric of the left riled up mob rule sentiments. I accept them both (more or less), but do you really think from all the things that are going on, these two things are the most important factors in driving GD sentiment? 

Please don't misunderstand me: I am not arguing that the GD phenomenon can be solely attributed to ""left over far right anti communist sentiment from the civil war"".

true,uututhrwa,null,null,"&gt;So, your first argument is that leftists accusing people of being racists too much caused people to go to Golden Dawn. And your second argument is that polemic rhetoric of the left riled up mob rule sentiments. I accept them both (more or less), but do you really think from all the things that are going on, these two things are the most important factors in driving GD sentiment?

I do not think that it is solely because of the left. If I were to quantify it I'd say that it's something like 15% because of them, and they were not the cause, but they provided a trigering event. When they saw what was going on with the low classes in Agios Panteleimonas, and then far right members raising kremales in front of the parliament, they should have changed the approach from the beginning.

I also did not talk about the polemic rhetoric, this could still be polemic and not give excuses, but there was a certain thing about ""apenoxopoiisi simperiforon"" etc. For instance everybody knows (and feel free to discard the argument if you don't think I have enough proof) that the KKE did not participate in that thing where politicans where attacked. On paper it would be because they want the activities etc. to be officialy organized by the party, but in the end there was some thought behind it in the direction that I claimed above. You don't do this stuff when you have 20% of the greek society, glorifying the junta period.

&gt;So, your first argument is that leftists accusing people of being racists too much caused people to go to Golden Dawn. 

That's kind of more general than what I was saying, the problem happened specifically in those parts. You don't have to stop the anti racist festivals or something. Though I remember that back in 2008 I was talking with someone from like within an anarchy squat, and he actually agreed that ""LAOS is really a joke, with all this talk about racism that we do people will eventually start being racist"". Which is also why I replied to your original comment about LAOS in particurlar, I 'd rather have LAOS trying to ""draw the line of the immigration policy"" (or more like just pretend being patriotic to sell books while never intending to do something extreme), than the Golden Dawn members trying to outdo each other on how many ""pakistakia espasan"" (the actual quote I heard was ""den eimai ratsistis alla re file ekei pou meno me kati paidia mazevomaste kai spame pakistakia den tous mporo re file vromane"")

Ich kann den Papst beleidigen und Synagogen mit Graffities beschmieren, in beiden Fällen gehen die Betroffenen zum Staat und bitten darum, diese Angelegenheit zu lösen.

Nun zeichne ich aber eine Karikatur eines Menschen namens Mohammed und in anderen Ländern sterben plötzlich meine Landsleute, werden Botschaften angegriffen, muss ich mit Mordanschlägen auf meine Person rechnen und wird ein Kopfgeld auf mich ausgesetzt.

Wie kommt man denn unter solchen Realitäten auch nur auf die Idee, Islam und andere Religionen seien vergleichbar was deren Friedfertigkeit angeht? 

Sprechen Sie doch mal mit Salman Rushdie über seine Erlebnisse nach dem veröffentlichen der Satanischen Verse und danach besuchen Sie einfach die Titanic- Redaktion und fragen die, wie es ihnen erging nach dem Sie den Papst als inkontinenten Greis verspotteten. Die einen bekamen schlimmstenfall Emails in Großbuchstaben, der andere lebt bis heute unter Polizeischutz, 25 Jahre später.

Und dies sind keine Einzelfälle bei denen man behaupten könnte, einigen wenigen sehr radikalen seien da mal die Pferde durchgegangen. Scheinbar hat auch nur der Islam solche fanatischen Anhänger.

Man muss nichtmal mit einem anderen Maß messen, der Islam sprengt einfach jede Skala in Brutalität, Gewaltbereichtschaft- und Verherrlichung, Menschenhass. Das Schlimme ist, er wird so gelebt. 

Ja, es gibt im Christentum und dessen Schriften fragwürdiges Material, aber lebt das jemand aus? Kein Schwein. Da wettert man im Hinterzimmer mal gegen die Juden oder wünscht sich einen neuen Kreuzzug, hält sich am nächsten Tag aber wieder brav an alle Gesetze und besucht wahrscheinlich auch noch die jüdische Gedenkveranstaltung zum Jahrestag.

Auch ist es völlig unproblematisch als Moslem frei im Vatikan zu leben, versuchen Sie das mal umgekehrt in Saudi Arabien. Wohlgemerkt, als Moslem. In Freiheit. In Saudi Arabien. Viel Glück.

Oder entscheiden Sie sich als Christ sowie als Moslem zum Religionsaustritt. Der Ex- Christ in Deutschland merkts jeden Monat am Kontostand, dass keine Kirchensteuer mehr abgeht, der Ex- Moslem im Iran wird gesteinigt.

Es handelt sich beim Islam eben nicht um die vom Staat getrennte Religion.

But I don't define a 'bad song' by qualities such as 'entertaining', 'fun to dance and sing to' and 'catchy'.

Whether or not a song was 'good' or 'bad' has had very little effect on who wins the contest. Many people hated how awful Lordi seemed to be during 2006, but they ended up winning.

Watching the Greek song in a public arena, I saw the entire crowd [over 200 of us] stand on their seats and start cheering and dancing during the song, and cheering once more every time the Greek preview came up.

Honestly I'm sick and tired of this. I have no problem with immigration but if you come to France (or any European country), you must be grateful and integrate. If you're coming here to take advantage of our welfare system, refuse to integrate and create your state within our state and finally become criminal delinquents overburdening our criminal system, then you should be kicked out and your spot should be given to someone more worthy. It starts with us harshly punishing these types. I'm not saying to kick out all Muslims or those of Muslim descent but at the very least  if an immigrant commits a crime (whatever his faith) then kick him out. We don't need to import criminals or people who bring no value, we're not running a charity.

&gt; When you say ""European people"" you use it an euphemism for white people. And as I said million times before, just because Turks conquered Thrace this won't change.

And I'm saying you're wrong. Here's the thing; *you* don't get to pick what the word ""European"" means. This is a word that is debated, yes, but not by you. It's debated by people who have doctorates.

A French person can't just say ""I'm not European"". A Japanese person can't just say ""I'm European"". By the same token, you don't get to determine (based on whiteness) who's European and who isn't.

Oh, and in regards to your little comment about Puerto Rico, it was colonized by Spain. An European nation.

&gt; America is the land of immigrants and their nationality is not based on ethinicity so you cannot. I never said Albania and Kosovo aren't white, read it again.

This is just an example of the kind of discrimination minorities faced in France and still do. The simple fact that the number of Occitan speakers has decreased from 14 million in 1921 to 600.000 in 1993 should be proof enough. If you think the rest of Europe will be as willing as the French minorities to give up their cultural heritage and language then I can guarantee you Europe will never be united peacefully. 

&gt;I mean, the ""most evil"" backed (provable, documented) fact of ""cultural destruction"" i see in the modern history part is we taught french in every schools like we teach english now. 

The French government forbade the use of minority languages in schools, when addressing public officals and on TV(a ban which is still in place today). French teachers were encouraged to punish pupils who spoke minority languages instead of French. Please tell me how it this is similar to the way kids are being taught English today? 

&gt;But i have yet to hear about kids getting punished for speaking some language rather than another in the day to day life. If, however, by some reason you had example i'm curious, show them ?


Art 30 of the French Teaching Law, 1851, stricly forbade the use of minority languages during class and breaks. As for examples, the Vergonha wikipedia article has a number of quotes about the punishments used.

&gt;(and no, again, i don't care about bad things happenning centuries ago because sometime we got to forget the hate which has no modern reason to exist)

Du kannst gerne billigste Polemik stundenlang (kann ich auch: Die Bibel liefert ebenfalls Rechtfertigung für Pädophilie, Vergewaltigung, Mord, Rassismus) betreiben, aber wenn du deinen Gegenüber konsequent ignorierst weil du keine Argumente hast wirst du halt sehr sehr schnell als rechter Scharfmacher in die Ecke gestellt. Und das nicht zu unrecht.

Pour avoir suivi en France un cursus partiellement bilingue, j'ai trouvé l’expérience plutôt intéressante. Certains cours/TD etaient dédoublés et on pouvait au choix les suivre soit en francais soit en anglais, selon le niveau des étudiants. D'avoir l'habitude de suivre des cours en anglais facilitait ensuite l'intervention des professeurs étrangers invités. Évidement ce type d'enseignement n'est pas vraiment compatible avec une réduction des budgets de l’éducation supérieure...

Je ne pense pas que l'instauration de cours en anglais va permettre le rayonnement ""d'élites polyglottes"" mais si cela peut contribuer à relever le niveau moyen catastrophique en anglais des diplômés, pourquoi pas.

Und hören Sie auf Vergleiche mit dem Christentum zu ziehen. Nur weil das Christentum Menschrechtsverletzungen gut heißt, bedeutet das nicht, dass dies für den Islam plötzlich in Ordnung ist oder dieser dadurch aufgewertet.

Uh, might simply be an isolated ridiculous exception. Never saw anything like this before. Probably found that one in an isolated backwater like you tend to find shit in TN, Florida or Texas (the barbarian in the hills giving your country a bad name).

&gt; The simple fact that the number of Occitan speakers has decreased from 14 million in 1921 to 600.000 in 1993 should be proof enough

The simple fact that a language disappear doesn't necessarily mean people are getting oppressed... it's could simply mean the language is obsolete, and therefore becoming unused. I think you're jumping steps you should not and making invalid logic shortcuts.

&gt; The French government forbade the use of minority languages in schools, when addressing public officals and on TV(a ban which is still in place today).

That's the point i contest. Most schools did not *forbad* anything. French was used simply because it was the most common language around and because they would not translate the program in 15 different language. It's a question of practicality.

&gt; Art 30 of the French Teaching Law, 1851, stricly forbade the use of minority languages during class and breaks. 

Yeah and there's still that law around saying women should not wearing pants somewhere in the code. Obsolete and ridiculous laws from centuries ago still lie in every country law code. Doesn't mean any of them get applied anywhere.

&gt; and it is still illegal to speak a minority language on television. 

Uh, it's not illegal. Just that like in the US ratings are everything and most channels won't ""waste"" antenna time for something adressed to 1% of the population when they could make more ratings and money. But, again, having lived in france for like 20 years i never heard about anyone punished for speaking another language oO It's even more ridiculous to pretend other languages are banned, considering we have Arte , a tv channel sharing antenna time with neighboring countries including germany (and *nobody* speak german in France beyond neighboring regions.)",0,1368992675,null,0,1368992875,0,ca1vmic,t3_1ekwit,t1_ca1vmic,t1_ca1ta2v,null,1431104357,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Well. Have you talked to a KKE/member voter recently? The rift is so big with Syriza, I don't even know where to begin. You can also have a look at both parties respective programmes. I am not sure you will find anything in common.

That's already a very strong position, which is essentially's Syriza's programme position (and it keeps being undermined by it's leadership). KKE would tell you that you need a unilateral EU exit, which would be a prerequisite for any part of their programme. So would Antarsya probably.

Non. C'est fait de manière illégale. Cf. [la gueulante de l'Académie](http://www.academie-francaise.fr/actualites/declaration-de-lacademie-francaise-du-21-mars-2013) qui rappelle l'état actuel des choses :

« *L’actuel article L121-3II du Code de l’Éducation dispose que la langue de l’enseignement supérieur est le français, sauf deux exceptions justifiées par les nécessités pour l’enseignement des langues étrangères ou pour les enseignements des professeurs étrangers invités.* »

&gt; quand je parle d'inconvénients c'est pour les étudiants

Une fois de plus je pense qu'on peut faire confiance aux équipes pédagogiques : elles n'ont absolument aucun intérêt à mettre en difficulté les étudiants, bien au contraire. Je vois mal des cours L1 (et même L2) se dérouler en anglais sauf projet pédagogique spécial (dans le prolongement des rares classes européennes du lycée par exemple) affiché.
