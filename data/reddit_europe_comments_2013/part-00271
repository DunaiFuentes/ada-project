Non ti fa la morale. Ti fa vedere la storia di uno che per un pelo di figa non si è fatto remore a lavorare per Salvo Lima e che adorava (comicamente, ma non troppo) andreotti.

Sono d'accordo con te. Il messaggio del film è chiaro e anche la fabula lo è in modo indiscutibile, non ho mai sostenuto il contrario.

&gt;Gli attori bambini poi... veramente non so che film hai visto, perchè è dai tempi di ""io speriamo che me la cavo"" che non vedo dei bambini recitare così.

Su questo non sono d'accordo, ma non saprei cosa aggiungere, se non che, a mio parere, i bambini scelti per questo film non sono all'altezza di recitare. Poi possiamo discuterne all'infinito senza trovare un punto. Gli attori di ""Io speriamo che me la cavo"" erano forse diretti meglio (certe volte basta anche solo quello, anche con attori non professionisti), per non parlare di quelli de ""La pecora nera"" di Celestini, se non l'hai visto te lo consiglio.

&gt;Non è divertente, mi dici? Ma mi spieghi cosa cazzo c'è da ridere quando si parla di una regione e di un paese in mano a dei criminali che non si fanno storie a fal saltare un palazzo per ammazzare un giudice? che cosa cazzo c'è da ridere. Dimmelo. Sei uno di quelli che trova i film di fantozzi ""non divertenti"" per caso? Non è un film da ridere. Ti strappa qualche risata, ma non è una commedia, cristo d'un dio.

""La mafia uccide solo d'estate"" è una commedia drammatica, che è un preciso sottogenere della commedia. Una commedia drammatica tratta temi anche drammatici utilizzando gli stilemi e le strutture della commedia (protagonista inadeguato al mondo narrativo, gag visive o linguistiche ecc.). Altri esempi (riusciti) di questo sottogenere sono ""La vita è bella"", il già citato ""La pecora nera"" e, per andare fuori dall'Italia, ""50/50"", un film uscito lo scorso anno. Una commedia, anche nel suo sottogenere di commedia drammatica, deve far ridere e deve farlo in modo efficace, altrimenti significa che qualcosa non funziona. Ovviamente mi riferisco a quelle sezioni del film che vorrebbero suscitare la risata e non lo fanno e non ai momenti drammatici, ci mancherebbe altro. Una gag come quella del cimitero, ad esempio, il cui al bambino, rimasto solo, un anziano dice: ""Non ti preoccupare, è andata in un posto migliore"" e il bambino risponde (prevedibilmente) ""No, no. E' andata in Svizzera"" a me non fa ridere, magari a qualcun altro sì, eh, per carità. Un altro esempio è il presentatore televisivo che usa dei maldestri francesismi nel parlato: dovrebbe essere un personaggio comico-grottesco, a me risulta solo una macchietta.

&gt;Aggiungo: non è una commedia all'italiana. non ha il lieto fine. Non fa ridere. E' un film sulla vita tragica di chi è vissuto apalermo quando si respirava mafia. Ripeto, non c'è un cazzo da ridere.

Il sillogismo ""non è una commedia all'italiana/non ha il lieto fine"" è errato. Ti posso fare almeno due esempi, ma ne trovi quanti ne vuoi: ""Il sorpasso"" di Dino Risi o ""La grande guerra"" di Monicelli: non hanno il lieto fine ma sono grandissime commedie all'italiana. E lì sì che c'era da ridere, e anche tanto, e questo non impediva certo allo spettatore di avvertire la tragicità di fondo del tema trattato, anzi lo rafforzava.

Per concludere (rispondendo anche all'altro tuo commento): non mi aspettavo certo una ""commedia volemose bene"" (qualunque cosa sia) e non direi mai che Shindler's List non fa abbastanza ridere (non è una commedia infatti, e non mi aspetterei niente del genere). Mi aspettavo solo un film riuscito, dal momento che penso che Pif sia un autore molto capace (almeno in tv) e sono rimasto deluso dal non aver trovato un film all'altezza. 

Mi dispiace anche che non si possa mai fare una conversazione senza trascendere in toni aggressivi o provocatori (""perché non vi conosco ma secondo me siete stronzi"" è una frase violenta e gratuita tanto quanto dire ""il film non l'ho visto ma secondo me fa cagare"", è sullo stesso livello), perché a me piace molto discutere, anche appassionatamente, di cinema, però mi piace farlo in un clima costruttivo.

I'm saying that Europe has plenty of areas that are as corrupted as Albania or even more, and they have been admitted. Statistics for corruption come from asking residents on the streets. Albanians are used at being told that they are corrupted, and they say ""yes, there's corruption"" even when they haven't experienced any, or when they have experienced as much as other Southern Europen countries have experienced. British media say ""people of Asian origin"" on the news for people caught doing crimes when they are Pakistani or Indian. They don't specify the country because of their interest in those countries or because their governments sue them. They say ""southern Europeans"" when they are Bulgarian, Romanian, Greek, Italian or Serbian. But they rush to say ""30 people were caught with a huge amount of drugs, two of them Albanian"" even when Albanians just two in a group of 30. They don't say where the other 28 come from. This affects even Albanians, who believe foreign press blindly, and who are very self-conscious about their country's reputation, due to a ridiculous inferiority caused by 50 years of complete isolation from the world. And it is unfair. Albanians have a stupid fixation that the rest of the world is smarter and better, because they have not seen the world, as you can tell from the guy with the Albanian flag. They have this even for countries like Syria, until they travel there and see them. Then they change their minds. Most of the blame goes to the Albanian politicians who do not sue these newspapers for slander, as other countries have done, and that's why for others they say ""asian, southern european"", etc. Our politicians are also to blame because they slander against each other for corruption with deep hate, without caring about the country's reputation and the fact that their declarations are monitored. Most of our politicians' accusations against each other for corruption are false, just to impact the population and their votes.  Most of our bad reputation comes from newspapers than from our actual deeds. Albanians are the most welcoming to foreigners, and yet the British media loves to describe us as a dangerous country to visit. When they really visit Albania, almost all British say: ""Wow, it wasn't as bad or as intimidating as I expected"". Because that's what they hear in the news. I work with foreigners here in Albania, and that's the most common reaction especially from the British, northern Europeans and Australians, who base their information on British newspapers a lot.

Non vedendo arrivare nulla, mercoledì 14/11, poiché nessuno mi rispondeva a telefono, ho inviato un'email per annullare l'ordine, pensando che avrei potuto acquistare l'oggetto in un negozio fisico. Intanto una signorina mi ha risposto a telefono e mi ha detto che me l'avrebbe inviato urgentemente e mi sarebbe arrivato venerdì 16, ultimo giorno di lavoro del corriere prima di sabato 17 novembre. 
 

Sempre il giorno mercoledì 14, inoltre, mi arriva la seguente email:

 
""Gentile Signor xxx, in riferimento alla Sua segnalazione, la presente per comunicarLe che la nostra divisione di competenza ha provveduto in data odierna ad evadere il Suo ordine [xxxxxxxx] effettuato presso il nostro servizio Compra On Line.""
 

A tal punto ho detto alla signorina che se era assolutamente sicura che il pacco mi sarebbe arrivato entro il 16, poteva ignorare la mia richiesta di annullamento dell'ordine e chiudere la pratica.

 
Venerdì, vedendo che nessun pacco era arrivato intorno a mezzogiorno, ho richiamato e mi è stato detto che il pacco non era ancora stato spedito nonostante mi avevano detto che era stato spedito, e anche se fosse stato spedito all'istante non sarebbe assolutamente arrivato in tempo. A quel punto annullo definitivamente l'ordine, sia per telefono che per email.
 

Lunedì 19 novembre mi arriva un'email con scritto:
 

""Gentile Cliente,siamo spiacenti di informarti che il tuo ordine:
 

Ordine nr.: xxxxxxxx del 05.11.2012 22:44:261 
 

è stato annullato."".
 

Inoltre, su mediaworld.it da quel giorno l'ordine risulta in stato: CANCELLATO.

 
Ripeto, tutto questo il 19 novembre.

 
Il giorno 24/11/2012, cinque giorni dopo la conferma dell'avvenuta cancellazione dell'ordine, MediaWorld Compra Online preleva i soldi dalla mia carta PostePay.

 
Diversi giorni dopo, il 4 dicembre, mi accorgo del prelievo ed invio un'email al Servizio Clienti MediaWorld per chiedere la restituzione del denaro.

 
Il 6 dicembre mi arriva un'email in cui MediaWorld mi chiede di scrivergli entro cinque giorni l'IBAN del mio conto corrente al fine di effettuare un bonifico a mio favore per il risarcimento. Rispondo il 7 dicembre fornendo nome, cognome e IBAN.
 

Tre giorni dopo, il 10 dicembre, mi arriva un'email con scritto:

 
""la presente per informarLa che abbiamo prontamente inoltrato le Sue coordinate bancarie alla nostra divisione di competenza, la quale provvederà quanto prima ad effettuare il rimborso a Suo favore.""

 
Il 18 dicembre invio un'email con scritto:""Gentile Servizio Clienti, sono passati ormai otto giorni e non c'è traccia del rimborso che dovevate effettuare ""quanto prima"". Vorrei richiedere aggiornamenti sullo stato dell'operazione e sollecitarne l'immediata esecuzione. Ne approfitto per ricordarvi che Media World Compra Online non ha mai avuto il diritto di prelevare denaro dalla mia carta di credito, e che il prelievo è stato effettuato circa una settimana DOPO la conferma dell'annullamento dell'ordine.""

 
Ricevo immediatamente una risposta:


""in riferimento alla Sua segnalazione, con la presente per comunicarLe che abbiamo provveduto a predisporre il bonifico di rimborso in data 14/12/12 con valuta 18/12/2012 relativo all'ordine numero [xxxxxxxx].""


 
Inoltre, nella stessa email, mi ricordano gentilmente che loro si possono anche prendere 30 giorni per rimborsarmi soldi che non avrebbero mai dovuto prendere, mentre invece io avevo soltanto cinque giorni per inviargli le mie coordinate bancarie. Nota personale: a questo punto mi viene da chiedere cosa sarebbe successo se non avessi risposto entro cinque giorni.
 


Sto ancora aspettando il risarcimento.

One conclusion I myself drew is that the current electoral situation is driving the EU debate in Britain. The Conservatives and UKIP are competing with each other, so to gain the larger share of the conservative eurosceptic vote (especially from where Cameron is sitting, he has to deal with the possibility that this will affect his district vote in competing with a majority against Labour). As such, the Euro-debate is heavily polarized and imbued by the electoral agendas of those two parties, which I think distorts the debate. 

I for one, believe Cameron is using the suggestion of a referendum as a political tool.

If the codes match you enter your PIN (PIN 1 to authenticate, PIN 2 to sign), the phone sends a message back to the server and voilà, you have  a signed document. No ID-card/reader required.

Romania and Bulgaria might not be economically on par with Western Europe or most of the former Eastern Bloc but they have much bigger economies than Albania.

&gt;So, that's what will happen with us. It will be just a matter of image, although most of Albanians are uninformed enough to think differently. We will be forced to pay higher taxes that we don't pay now, and EU investments here won't make any huge difference, as they didn't make with Bulgaria and Romania.

They've helped quite a bit and they'll definitely help Albania. It won't make a huge difference, sure, but that wasn't the point of alocating them in the first place. 

I believe the EU should be more careful in selecting its future members but that doesn't mean I am against Albania joining. The EU could do a lot of good for the countr, not necessarily in economic terms but in social and political ones as well, as it has in both Romania and Bulgaria.

Il pacco viene spedito l'11 giugno da Milano con DHL, ma non mi viene inviato il codice di tracciamento. Il 14 giugno invio un'email al servizio clienti e mi mandano il codice, informandomi che il pacco è stato consegnato il 13 giugno. Peccato che io non abbia mai ricevuto niente, neanche un avviso di mancata consegna. Glielo faccio presente e mi inviano la ricevuta di consegna, firmata da tale ""Scalpello"" con una firma illeggibile e mi invitano a chiedere direttamente a DHL. Dato che è mezzogiorno, decido di andare nel primo pomeriggio alla filiale DHL che aveva preso in carico il mio pacco, quella di Lecce, sciroppandomi 25km di auto.

Arrivato lì, chiedo delucidazioni su come mai il pacco risulti consegnato a un certo ""Scalpello"" quando nessuno nella mia via ha quel cognome. L'addetto chiede in giro, fa un po' di telefonate e chiama l'autista che il giorno precedente ha messo il pacco nel furgone, il quale dice che quel giorno non ha consegnato a Nardò e che quel pacco (che sull'etichetta aveva il **MIO** nome e il **MIO** indirizzo), insieme a tanti altri, l'ha consegnato a Cavallino, vicino Lecce, in un'azienda di cui non ricordano di preciso il nome ma solo parte della via. L'addetto mi da il numero del corriere responsabile del casino e taglia corto con una specie di ""veditela tu insieme a lui, il pacco dovrebbe essere lì"". Andandomene, provo a chiamare il corriere ma non mi risponde. Comincio a cercare aziende a Cavallino sul cellulare e ne trovo una con un nome molto simile a quello riferitomi proprio in quella via. Dato che il corriere non mi risponde, *mi faccio il paro-sparo* e decido di andare a trovarli.

Una volta arrivato, scopro che si tratta di un'azienda di informatica. Citofono, salgo al primo piano (non prima di aver notato che usano il piano terra come magazzino) e chiedo alle due segretarie presenti se il giorno precedente hanno ricevuto un pacco che non era per loro. Cominciano a cercare nei registri e in quel preciso istante entra il direttore, al quale ripeto la solita domanda e aggiungo che nel pacco c'era solo un processore. Al che il viso di una segretaria si illumina e dice piano ""Effettivamente sì, abbiamo ricevuto solo un processore... un pacco a nome Valluan... è vero... l'abbiamo aperto, abbiamo visto che c'era solo quello, abbiamo chiesto ai dipendenti ma non era di nessuno e l'abbiamo messo di sotto..."" e continuano a scartabellare tra i registri. Io ormai sono tranquillo e continuo a parlare con il direttore, che contribuisce a tranquillizzarmi dicendo ""E meno male che siamo un'azienda di informatica, se non lo fossimo stati probabilmente sarebbe tornato indietro..."". Pochi minuti dopo, di fronte al fatto che le segretarie stanno ancora nuotando tra le carte ""perché dobbiamo segnare, dobbiamo togliere il protocollo, dobbiamo cercare..."" il direttore sbotta: ""Ma insomma, c'è qui il signore che dice che il pacco è suo, vi ha pure mostrato la carta d'identità, se sta sotto muovetevi e andatelo a prendere!"". Nel frattempo i dipendenti in pausa avevano formato una piccola tribuna di fronte alla macchinetta, proprio fuori dalla segreteria, e si stavano godendo lo spettacolo sogghignando e guardandomi con aria complice. Passa qualche minuto e un'altra persona sale con il pacco: io confermo che è mio, apro tutto (su pressione del direttore che non voleva che mancasse niente) e il processore c'è, perfetto. A questo punto il direttore nota che sull'etichetta del pacco c'è il *mio* nome e, soprattutto, il *mio* indirizzo (a più di 30km di distanza!), guarda scocciato le segretarie e le affonda con: ""Ma scusate, eh... ma voi, che diavolo fate... vedete che il pacco non è manco destinato a Cavallino e lo prendete comunque, c'è pure il numero di telefono e non chiamate nessuno... ma che cose sono queste?!... Ma io non so, ma non vi è venuto in mente di fare un colpo di telefono e di dire ""Signor Valluan, abbiamo il suo pacco""? Assurdo, assurdo..."". Le segretarie non osano proferir parola (e ripeto, tutto ciò col capannello di dipendenti che quasi facevano il tifo). Io taglio corto, provo a sdrammatizzare e me ne vado salutando tutti, col direttore che si scusa per la confusione.

Uscito, provo a chiamare quel cazzone del corriere due volte: la prima non risponde, la seconda vede la chiamata e fa partire la segreteria. Gli mando un messaggio ringraziandolo per l'aiuto e mi sciroppo il ritorno a casa.

TL;DR: pacco con processore recapitato in un'altra città a decine di km di distanza, DHL mi dice di sbrigarmela da solo, vado dove l'hanno consegnato (un'azienda di informatica) e il direttore fa un cazziatone galattico alle segretarie per aver preso e aperto il pacco quando non erano i destinatari e per non avermi neanche chiamato per avvertirmi.",0,1387033378,null,0,1387033643,0,ce1k72k,t3_1st8o8,t1_ce1k72k,t3_1st8o8,null,1428136682,9,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,9

Left-wing people also see the ÖVP as xenophobic.

So they thought, let's make a campaign to show how young and open minded we are. Let's put our youngest relevant member in front and make party.

Sadly, Kurz agreed to do this.

I think, Kurz is despite of his age and inexperience one of the best politicians of the ÖVP. This campaign is a rather dark point in his career.

Our former minister of science, a former rector and professor, who was one of the very few competent ministers, is not part of the new government. I didn't support his agenda at all, it was mostly dictated by the conservatives and didn't help the universities very much, but it's a really bad sign to subordinate science to the ministry of economy. But most people are just talking about the young guy, who is obviously not the best guy to represent Austria internationally, while one thing we could be really good at - science - is seemingly not important at all to the new government.

Why not merge agriculture with economy instead? Fucking morons.

Perhaps, but Poland/Estonia/Latvia *are* comparable to southern Europe, and the evidence prove that the cohesion funds do not work 

If they did - why are Greece, Spain and Portugal still on the receiving end, and will be for another 7 years, *at least*? 

There is simply no evidence that the cohesion funds work, but plenty of evidence that they do not. 

The EU should have a scientific approach to things, when possible. The evidence point to that they do not work, thus they should be completely remodelled, or abandond. Perhaps one could invest the money in research or something.

By not being up to standard i didn't mean _just_ corruption. There are lots of other factors in place, like a mature judicial system. The right checks and balances on government functioning. The disparity of Bulgaria and Romania im comparison with EU nations when talking about labor productivity. They needed to be closer than they were. 

These are things that can and should be resolved before letting those nations join. When the economic disparity is smaller then the resources of the EU would spread less thin. You also lose a lot of leverage on these nations once they've joined, so before joining is the right time to fix these problems. Not to mention that you import a part of the problem into the EU area, by letting those nations join. A lot of financial aid is already given to countries with candidate status, so they're being helped to close the gap a bit before joining also (main reason why Turkey is still a EU candidate).

There are other problems too, like the cheap workers from Eastern Europe which flock to Western Europe for higher pay.

No, not necessarily but the overwhelming evidence is that it doesn't work. 


&gt;I have a feeling they did work for countries like Estonia, Poland or the Czech Republic. I might be mistaken, though, but it has been 9 years since they all joined, there have to be hard numbers available.

A feeling is less trustworthy, however noble and positive, than the overwhelming facts that we have from southern Europe.

The EU should act upon evidence and facts- don't you agree? That means that the cohesion funds must stop. Otherwise, we are acting against facts (a lot of countries have had success without cohesion funds, Polands success might very well be due to the effectiveness of the Poles for example). I guess that is not how you want the EU to spend our money. 

&gt;Are you against richer countries helping poorer ones in development in general, or just against the way it is currently being done?

No, but I think it is extremely rarely done correctly. Look at aid in Africa - some countries are worse off than 50 years ago... In fact, a lot of economists have asked for a stop to aid, because it is counter productive. 

I think the same thing is going on in southern Europe. 

So, if we are to help poor countries, it should be effective. Not against it in principle.

But, if you ask, I do not ask to get the money back from the EU. For example, if they take the cohesion fund money and turn it into EU research fund money, I'll be happy. 

&gt;EU is lead by politicians and lawyers - the kind of people who would not recognize scientific method if it were to hit them in a face.

true,angry_spaniard,ESPR,Delenda est euro,"&gt; You are still on the reciving end, you are not contributing to the EU, you are receiver and will be for the next 7 years. For 33 years you will take money from the EU, not give. That is too long - why haven't Spain become net contributors? If the cohesion funds worked -- why are we still giving you money? Why arent't you giving the rest of Europe money? I'll give you that on the cohesion funds though.

The most simple answer is because there are more undeveloped regions in Spain than the EU average and the primary sector is bigger than the EU average(Spain is now the 2nd biggest retriever of CAP funds after France). 

Italy has been a net contributor the las 50 years to the EU(and predecessors) however for this budget they are mostly neutral. The Italian economy has had the secon biggest fall in the last ten years after Greece. You can't blame missuse of EU funds or whatever with them. Cohesion funds are for countries that are having a hard time with the current. Structural funds are for undeveloped regions inside countries.

The period 2007-2013 has been the first period without getting cohesion EU funds and moving from getting 400 euros per capita to 50 euros, and the first period increasing the difference with the EU average instead of decreasing.

&gt; And Catalonian independence- won't that mean that Spain gets less money from Catalonia? That increases the risk of Spain continuing being a net recipient instead of someone who pays towards the EU, doesn't it?

That's the *joke*. Spain would qualify for cohesion funds without Catalonia.


Spain more like UK than Italy has quite big differences between regions(UK has divided Wales for this budget in a way that half of Wales qualifies for structural funds). Other countries have more territorial cohesion like Sweden, France or Western Germany had(OK, still has but there is also the East).

Between regions or inside regions, from Seville(Andalusia capital and biggest city)  to Marbella there is a big difference in living standards and development in favour of Marbella.

Das Urheberrecht gewährt dem Urheber Schutz bezüglich der Urheberpersönlichkeitsrechte und bzgl der Verwertungsrechte an seinem Werk. 

Verwertungsrechte finden wir [hier](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/urhg/__15.html)

Mit dem Download wird ein Einverständnis des Urhebers, sein Werk zu nutzen umgangen.
Beim File-sharing wird das Werk nach rechtlicher Ansicht öffentlich zugänglich gemacht, das ist ein geschütztes Recht des Urhebers, daher braucht man dazu eine Erlaubnis.
Ich nehme an, dass es recht verständlich ist,dass das Werk durch einen Download zumindest vervielfältigt wird. Zu so einer Nutzung hätte der Urheber zustimmen müssen.

Problemfall Streaming: Mein technisches wissen ist begrenzt, daher bitte ich um Nachsicht, sollte etwas nicht stimmen.

   
Beim Streaming ""guckt"" man ja eigentlich nur. Allerdings wird auch im cache eine Zwischenspeicherung vorgenommen.
Problem hier: das wird wohl automatisch gelöscht (?!), oder ist jedenfalls nur von vorübergehender Natur, daher ist das keine wirkliche Vervielfältigung. 
Der Nutzer macht hier nichts öffentlich zugänglich, er verbreitet nichts etc. Die Vervielfältigung ist ein Streitpunkt. Daher scheint es noch zu heißen, dass beim Streaming nicht unbedingt eine Urheberrechtsverletzung vorliegt. (Lohnt sich dann im Zweifel wohl nicht zu klagen)

Jetzt zu dem Teil der wirtschaftlichen Schädigung.

Der [Schaden](http://anwalt-im-netz.de/urheberrecht/schadensersatz-urheberrecht.html) kann im Urheberrecht verschiedenartig berechnet werden.
Kurz zusammengefasst: Schaden entweder = Was hätte eine Lizenz gekostet ODER = entgangener Gewinn ODER = Verletzergewinn (Summe, die der Verletzer erwirtschaftet hat)
Aber dazu kommt dann noch, dass immaterielle Schäden ( hier sehr abstrakt, aber das sind Rufschädigungen etc.) UND die Kosten für die Verfolgung der Verletzung auch als Teil des Schadens gelten. Und als wäre das nicht genug, darf der Rechtsinhaber (Urheber oder berechtigter Dritter) sich aussuchen welche Art der Schadensberechnung angewandt wird. (Da wird man wohl die nehmen, die am meisten abwirft)  

Darauf werden sich die Anwälte ""berufen"" haben.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; The most simple answer is because there are more undeveloped regions in Spain than the EU average and the primary sector is bigger than the EU average(Spain is now the 2nd biggest retriever of CAP funds after France).


No,that is if you exclude Eastern Europe. Your regions are *not* more underdevloped, nor do you have a smaller GDP/capita than Poland, Bulgaria, Romania etc. So, no, you should be contributing. 

&gt;Italy has been a net contributor the las 50 years to the EU(and predecessors) however for this budget they are mostly neutral. The Italian economy has had the secon biggest fall in the last ten years after Greece. You can't blame missuse of EU funds or whatever with them. Cohesion funds are for countries that are having a hard time with the current. Structural funds are for undeveloped regions inside countries.

Yes, it is their fault. If you don't fix your corrupt and non productive south and elect and re-elect Berlusconi - don't expect the EU to pick up the slack for you. The people within the countries are the only one that can fix them, but the Italians have consistently been failing to do so. And, the rest of us who are not corrupt and pay our taxes have to pay for them. So, they can't fuck up their country and expect us to pick up the slack - but that is what several regions in the south is doing. 

That is wrong for so many reason. A) why the fuck should I pay for someone else's willing failure, corruption etc. B) it has become like aid to Africa- a monster who doesn't actually help, but more counter productive. People don't have to fix anything if we pay for it. C) Scientifically it is not effective. The EU should be run by science. 

&gt; Structural funds are for undeveloped regions inside countries.

And there should be a time limit on that,  short window when one can apply plus a bloody good reason why one haven't developed. Why haven't Italy? Why haven't Spain? You have had *a lot* of time, a lot, so it is a choice. Not the fault of the rest of the EU if Italy have refused to develop. Their choice, their money. 



And - again. The cohesion funds are not working. If they were, Greece who has been receiving since 1981, should be contributing, just like Spain and Portugal. None of those countries are, and it hardly look like at least Greece and Portugal will do it in 2020, so there's is another 7 years. 

We have some countries that have become permanent recipients. I only think one should be allowed to be on the reciving end for max 25 years. Why should the rest of the EU pay for Greece for decades while they refuse to fix themselves, like southern Italy? It is their fault, not mine, but I have to pay for it. 

And, we should have an EU run by science, and facts. Don't you agree to that?  If the cohesion funds worked - Greece, Spain and Portugal should be in the black. They are not. Thus, they have to be abandonded. Perhaps one could use the money in research, or environmental issues. The facts speak for themselves. 

&gt;That's the joke. Spain would qualify for cohesion funds without Catalonia.

Another reason why the cohesion funds do not work and should be dismantled. 

But, do you honestly think Catalonia will get independence? 

&gt;Other countries have more territorial cohesion like Sweden, France or Western Germany had(OK, still has but there is also the East).

But that is also, partly a political choice Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, the Netherlands and Germany has made. Germany has huge transfers between the regions for example. 

&gt;And the Basque Country is way better than anybody else including Catalonia or Madrid.

 I had no idea, I thought Catalonia was the financial crown jewel, not Basque. Interesting. Thanks.

Sowohl Gesetze als auch deren Missachtung entwickeln sich nach Realität.

But I think it's pretty clear that Scotland would have to sign up on the basis of being a new member, and would start the negotiations with the loss of the UK's perks, i.e. the rebate and the opt-out from the Euro and Schengen. 

Of course, the Euro opt-out is partly artificial, it seems that can be put off for a significant period - although if the Scottish public do not want to join the Euro, it seems an odd position to put yourself in. 

The really interesting issue would be Schengen, because there the interests of rUK and an independent Scotland coincide against the EU.

The regional structural funds are given to regional governments. And the Spanish regions go from €30,829 euros per capita in the Basque Country to €15,308 in Extremadura, in Purchasing Power Extremadura is below Poland, but above Romania and Bulgaria.

UK has also regions getting structural funds and they are richer than us. You can tell that this promotes bad government, because the UK has been mistreating everything except SouthEast and London and as prize they are getting structural funds for Cornwall and parts of Wales.

You can see the map [here](http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/what/future/img/eligibility20142020.pdf)

&gt; And there should be a time limit on that, short window when one can apply plus a bloody good reason why one haven't developed. Why haven't Italy? Why haven't Spain? You have had a lot of time, a lot, so it is a choice. Not the fault of the rest of the EU if Italy have refused to develop. Their choice, their money

Italy is historically a net contributor bigger than UK and France until this budget. Italy as average was more developed than the EU average. Italy  was richer per capita than UK 20 years ago. Italy was considered developed. And it's not only the South who is slipping. Northen Italy isn't what it used to be either.

The reasons are different in every area. And some countries have changed a lot. You don't know how the Spanish  South was 40 years ago. And how it's now. It was way worse than Southern Italy or Portugal. Nowadays, it's way better. The Spain of masters and day laborers where the House of Alba and the Catholic church control the economy since the end of the Middle age. It had less organized crime at least, but completelly unintegrated Gitanos(roma) back in the day with massive crime rates and extremely high drug addiction rates. An economy where anything except farming, hunting and tourism was boicoted by the aristocracy, catholic church and the government, all the land was owned by a dozen of families and the church.

You would say that it's not working. I would say that you seem to forget from where we were 40 years ago. The reasons of the current Spanish situation are mostly bad regulation financial sector, lack of independent central bank monitoring the banks, overinvesting in the construction sector tolerated and promoted by the government, 7 non-university education laws in 30 years(and as bonus Catalonia is not going to apply the last one, that the government just approved), rampant corruption concentrated in certain regions however, my personal order: Valencia, Andalusia, Balearic Islands and Madrid. Ironically two of the richest regions that are net contributors to the Spanish cohesion mechanis, and would be to EU have been having constant corruption affairs the last years(Madrid and Balearic Islands). And they have been growing above the Spanish and EU average. 


&gt; But that is also, partly a political choice Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, the Netherlands and Germany has made. Germany has huge transfers between the regions for example.

Spain has those transfers also. Some years Catalonia has sent transfers around 8% of its GDP, whereas Basque country has never sent  more than 2% thank to the [Basque Economical Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Economic_Agreement).

&gt; But, do you honestly think Catalonia will get independence?

There is clear majority for it in Catalonia. Therefore,  the Spanish government is not going to allow doing a referendum. And if Catalonia's government tries to do it the Spanish government can suspend their self-government. I don't know what's going to happen we are in uncharted waters.
 
Spain could have stoped this fixing the situation that makes Catalonia the biggest contributor per capita without being the richest region, giving the same status to Basque Country and Catalonia whatever that status is, and respecting the position of the Catalan language in the education and the powers to decide the language of instruction in Catalonia, and not trying to overrule the prohibition of bullfighting done by the Catalonian government. There were issues before, but since the Spanish conservatives got an absolute majority two years ago they have been amazing pissing off Catalan people. BTW, I am from Valencia a region where we also speak the Catalan language outside of Catalonia, and ironically one of the regions where the Spanish nationalism is stronger.

&gt; I had no idea, I thought Catalonia was the financial crown jewel, not Basque. Interesting. Thanks.

Catalonia is the most important region because it has the second biggest population 7.3 millions of inhabitants and the biggest GDP). However, the Basque Country has the biggest GDP per capita, but only 2.2 millions of inhabitants. Furthermore, the Basque country has certain fiscal privileges due to that they supported the French in the Succesion war while Catalonian territories supported Habsburg and they don't contribute to the Spanish cohesion funds. The parts of the Basque Country where the fascist insurrection had the support of the local institutions kept the self-govenment even during the dictatorship(Navarra and Alava).

Breaking up with someone and committing suicide are incomparable.  There are life-altering decisions, and then there are life-ending ones.  And according to your logic, it would be unethical *ever* to stop someone from committing suicide - even if it's on a whim - because of the 'I own my body' argument.

&gt; It is arrogant to dismiss children of immigrants who can now hold dual citizenship

Seriously?
What's so bad about the german citizenship? Why does a 3rd generation ""immigrant"" (actually, someone should be german in 3rd generation. the term is part of the problem) need the citizenship of the country where his/her parents came from? This causes more problems than it solves.

&gt; to dismiss people in East Germany who will either profit from the minimum wage or from new labour agreements

A minimum wage is necessary, the agreement made now is ridicolous and dangerous.

&gt; Or to dismiss the real improvements in 'Leiharbeit' contracts.

What exactly do they want? I didn't hear about it yet.
The only acceptable would be that ""Leiharbeiter"" get the same wages than the rest of the company. Everything else would be ""Augenwischerei"".

And btw, calling people arrogant which don't share your opinion is very arrogant. Not that you would care though.

Je n'ai jamais dit ça. Merci de ne pas caricaturer. J'ai uniquement pointé que ton attitude était incohérente. L'Islam est une religion de grande intolérance, et pourtant je ne t'ai pas entendu dire que tu étais écœurée par l'Islam.

&gt;tu proposes quoi? 

D'abord, on a une Constitution, en particulier l'article 1êr :

**La France est une République indivisible, laïque, démocratique et sociale.**

L'article 2 :

**La langue de la République est le français**.

Le rapport contredit la constitution sur ces points, pour s'adapter aux demandes d'une minorité qui effectivement n'a pas compris ces deux articles. 

Je propose donc à ceux qui sont légalement sur le territoire de s'adapter et d'abandonner leurs anciennes traditions, et donc une partie de leur identité pour se conformer à la Constitution. 

Les musulmans sont parfaitement solubles dans la grande nation française tant qu'ils ont bien assimilé cette pudeur française vis-à-vis de la différence : revendiquer sa différence innée de minorité est considéré comme une menace en France, de part la longue histoire de rebellions, révoltes, et guerres civiles qui ont traumatisé la France.

Parallèlement, toujours pour les populations présentes, les élites doivent absolument vanter le modèle français et réprouver la notion de France plurielle, contraire à la Constitution.

Right, so you've basically undermined your own argument here.

&gt;Source on the illegality of emotional abuse and (non physical, non threatening, non-racial) bullying? 

Intimidation and harassment - which could both be construed as forms of emotional abuse - are usually illegal.  

&gt;How can it be known that I am truly suffering when only I can know this? 

I don't know.  How do I know that the world is real, and that it isn't a figment of my imagination (solipsism)?  You've asked an interesting philosophical question, but it's usually pretty obvious when someone is suffering. 

&gt;I would have a spouse divorce me and it ruins my life to the point where I want to commit suicide, this does not qualify as emotional abuse does it?

No, of course not.  But nobody marries someone because they intend to divorce them later, in order to cause them emotional pain.  Sometimes emotional pain is unavoidable.  

&gt;Well here we disagree fundamentally. What do you think about hard-drug use or the choice to enroll in the military?

I'm in favour of ending the 'war on drugs' and of legalising some drugs and decriminalising all of them.  But unlike suicide using hard drugs won't necessarily make it that you end up dying.

They are fundamentally supposed to represent and present the wishes of the entire population from minorities to majority's. We have several muslim MP's in differing parties as well as Christian parties that'll probably never reach majority position again due to secularization.

I don't think so, the Greece bail-out as well as all the other problems with Spain, Portugal, Ireland (loans) and Italy and Cyprus show that caution toward countries new-to-enter the EU is a good thing.

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"&gt;Right, so you've basically undermined your own argument her

How so?  An individual who finds killing to be wrong may one day be forced to do so in self-defense, an act he or she would consider unethical but necessary.  Do you not see the parallel?  I suppose not, another irreconcilable disagreement. 

&gt;Intimidation and harassment - which could both be construed as forms of emotional abuse - are usually illegal.

You are starting to take this line of reasoning far from where it started.  You began with the claim ""It's not fair on them and it's not fair on the people "".  You are making a judgement here about what is fair which I do not consider to be worthy of legal protection.  There are many rights an individual can exercise which might be ""not fair"" towards me, and they will be entirely within their right to do so.  If you think that the emotional injury caused by suicide can be considered as ""intimidation or harrassment"" I will be both wrong and surprised by your definition of emotional abuse.  

I attempted to indicate that emotional abuse is non-quantifiable because there is no way to acquire actual evidence that a person feels a particular way about something.  No need to turn this into a philosophical debate; causing someone sadness by exercising control over your own life/death cannot be a crime.  Terminal euthanasia patients are not faced with a similar legal challenge that their loved ones will be emotionally damaged by a premature death: it simply isn't up to them and the moral distinction with a non-terminal individual is non-existent.  Again we may have an irreconcilable disagreement, just so that we don't go back and forth on this last part.

If I sign up for the military I am voluntarily accepting the possibility of my own death (a death which I do not want) and the possibility of having to take another's life (something else I do not want, and that person would have their life involuntarily taken away, something they don't want).  While I may not personally be placed in either of those situations, someone in the army eventually will.  Lives will be lost/taken against their owner's will.  It is an inevitability in armed conflict, yet perfectly legal.  I see no distinction from suicide except in the case of the military the dying isn't actually wanted by either party, making it much worse. You may say ""yes but this is death without certainty, just a chance of dying instead of a conscious decision to do so"", yet when the military is taken as a whole surely you see that the certainty is total, just distributed over many individuals.  Does that really make a difference?  I suppose you would say ""yes"", and we would disagree.

I want to live in a society where if I want to die (and I'm in perfectly fine health), I'm allowed to do so without having to inconvenience the train network.  As with drug use it's going to happen, so let's make sure we do it in a civilized way.  I can understand how this will be a serious obstacle to overcome due to anti-suicide religious undertones in many European cultures.  Even Belgium isn't there yet.

I think that uni is the best on your list academically (in general; I don't know about in economics specifically).  The city is relatively small, but it's a college town and so student focused and fairly sophisticated.  Think Ithaca NY or Bloomington, Ind. You will run into other American students there, but not a giant contingent.

I would avoid Heidelberg; too many other American students, making it to easy to avoid having social contacts with Germans.

I was a Fremdsprachenassistent near Stuttgart, although I didn't study there (they may only have a T.H., although I'm not sure anymore).  But the few times I went to the campus, it seemed pretty dead - I got the feeling that most of the students were from Stuttgart or the surrounding area, and just went home on weekends.  (This may not have been the case, but it was the impression I got).  

If you can study outside of B-W, I'd recommend going to Berlin.  Berlin has the advantage of being cheap, but the disadvantage of being the easiest city to get by on with no German.  However, it's big, it's interesting, it has a lot of history.  It's very cool to live in a city like that.  Plus, as an American, if you study there for a year or two, and then return to the US to finish up and work, your only opportunity to go to Germany may be on vacation.  And you're much more likely to want to spend that vacation in someplace like Berlin, at least after your friends have all left wherever else it was that you studied; similarly, professional conferences are most likely going to be held in Berlin.

One night as we are in the subway, we see they are stopping people and checking their tickets with little hand held machines.  They stop us and ask for our tickets.  We never knew we had to even keep them, so we dig in our pockets and grab a bunch.  Some were new, not used, many expired that we used.  They scanned them all since we didn't know which one we just used.  They found one ticket that was good, but in the rest their machine couldn't find the other ticket.  They said all others were expired or new...and one ticket they scanned several times and finally just said ""no good"". Then they said we must pay right now through credit card (I forgot the fee amount).  We refused and told them we did not get in for free.  They held us for 15 mins and argued with us.  FInally they said ""we will call police"".  I found this so stupid. I understood they need to check tickets, but harassing tourists from america is not your target.  We offered to just use a new ticket but they refused.  We refused to pay, feeling like we are getting scammed.  I figured the police talk was a hollow threat...what are they going to do to us?

Non, le Coran n'est pas un texte dont tous les passages respirent la tolérance. Pas plus que l'Ancien Testament. Nous avons assez de mémoire en Europe pour nous rappeler les horreurs qui furent justifiées par la Bible.

C'est encore celui d'un Islam bricolé dans les caves par des jeunes en déshérence ou celui d'imams dont la formation et le financement serait assuré par le wahhabisme saoudien. Un Islam dont la lecture ne serait pas compatible avec les valeurs occidentales. Quand Sarkozy s'est déclaré pour la création d'un Islam de France et la construction de lieux de cultes, tout le monde lui est tombé dessus : la droite catho, le FN, la gauche laïcarde... Et il a tout laissé en plan (comme d'hab). Le CFCM a rapidement été grippé par des conflits internes et de fortes dépendances de l'étranger (Algérie, Maroc) qui ont miné la légitimité de l'instance. Construire une mosquée en France prend toujours des années et génère une guerre larvée entre les élites locales.

[Même si le système des imams ne peut s'apparenter à celui du clergé catholique](http://www.causeur.fr/la-formation-des-imams-fantasme-des-ministres-de-linterieur,24993), son institution permettrait de canaliser [ce renouveau de l'Islam auprès de communautés françaises](http://www.rue89.com/2013/02/24/comment-sont-formes-les-imams-de-france-239582) (faut-il le souligner) présentes depuis bientôt deux générations.

The reason the SNP contested this release was because they believed that the Scottish Ministerial Code prevents from from revealing legal advice.

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt; I am sure all the member states will accept Scotland. But on what terms? Will they let it have the same opt outs as the uk gets?

The UK has [three opt-outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union#Former_opt-outs):

* Schengen. Also granted to Ireland, and I don't see any particular reason why it wouldn't be granted to Scotland. Its only land border is with another non-Schengen country (rUK), so from the rest of the EU's POV there is no material difference if Scotland is in Schengen or not. The UK has a partial opt-out from the [AFSJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_freedom,_security_and_justice) but this is essentially the implications of Schengen for cross-border policing.
* Euro. Also granted to Denmark, and given the political situation in the UK (there is no great demand for the Euro) I don't see any reason why that wouldn't be carried forward. If it wasn't, there is no requirement for immediate adoption. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden are all in the EU but not the Eurozone - without any formal opt-out.
* [CFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union). The UK opt-out was primarily to ensure that UK citizens could not take cases to the European Court of Justice. The [treaty itself](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf) is pretty straightforward - no death penalty, no torture, intellectual property exists, innocent until proven guilty, etc.

The UK also enjoys a rebate, which is currently worth about £5bn (so say £500m to Scotland, on a roughly per-capita basis). 

However the rebate is based on the amount that the UK pays in to the EU relative to the amount it receives (if it pays in £100, and receives £70, it gets 2/3 the difference - or £20), has been reduced by 20%, is likely to be reduced further, and would be much less significant given that Scotland would make a smaller contribution to EU funding.

The UK's opt-outs/special treatment are things that are either unlikely to be an issue (Schengen), are not in fact an immediate requirement (Euro), or would not be not particularly significant to Scotland (CFR and rebate).",0,1387066498,null,0,false,0,ce1vhim,t3_1sv3bh,t1_ce1vhim,t1_ce1sbz0,null,1428131342,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

I don't think anyone is disputing that. The distinction is really that once Scotland has its referendum then there would be 18 months before the currently proposed independence date.

Given that the UK has [agreed to abide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Agreement_\(2012\)) by the referendum result, the EU is then faced with the (unprecedented) situation that part of an EU member state is going to leave that state but also wishes to be part of the EU.

The EU project is, at its heart, about creating links between countries that are difficult if not impossible to unravel. If Scotland were set on leaving the EU then this process, however difficult, would have to be done.

But given the desire to stay in the EU, and the existing presence as part of the UK (which removes the most complex part of accession - transposing EU legislation into the domestic legal system), it seems very unlikely that the best solution would be to do the work of extracting Scotland from the EU only to undo it shortly after.",0,1387066900,null,0,false,0,ce1vmm3,t3_1sv3bh,t1_ce1vmm3,t1_ce1ufjx,null,1428131276,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I am a pessimist when it comes to geopolitics, therefore I agree with the US security consensus that governments must be ever vigilant and proactive. I believe this is a cultural difference between North Americans and Europeans for a few reasons:

* The North American experience with armed conflict is abstract, while Europe's experience is concrete; the German Bundestag's dome is an expression of this.

* Most, if not all, European countries have dark histories with abusive national security forces. Abuse happened in Canada and the US too, but it took place in the shadows. 

Culturally, I have more trust for the defense establishment.

By disputing, what I meant was the idea that if Scotland left the UK it would not automatically leave the EU. I think that is quite clear, and I don't think any politicians in the UK/EU/Scotland disagree.

So the question is really one of timing. Does Scotland leave the UK and then spend some time outside the UK and EU before re-joining, or does it defer leaving the UK until such time as it can leave the UK and join the EU simultaneously?

&gt; Well, I'm pretty sure they will find a solution to make this work in a short time but Scotland will have to apply for membership as they are not yet a member. But I think it would be possible to get full membership status in these 18 months. I doubt that Scotland will get the same privileges as the UK though…

Sure, I think the most likely scenario is that the EU will simply deal with the situation as it unfolds. If Scotland votes no then there's nothing to do. If Scotland votes yes then the question is simply should they be allowed to ""apply"" while still part of the UK?

There is no precedent for that situation so I think pragmatism will win over ideology. Saying to a country ""yes, we know you're already compatible with the EU in every sense - but you're going to have to wait over there for 3 years just because"" seems counter-productive. 

If that was the final decision then Scotland would simply defer leaving the UK a little longer.

I've posted about the UK's current opt-outs [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1sv3bh/independent_scotland_would_have_to_reapply_to_eu/ce1vhim). I think Schengen is really the only one of significance, but given that it would make no practical difference to any other member I don't see it as being a particularly large problem.

Ce n'est pas ce qu'on demande. On leur demande la même chose qu'aux cathos, et il faut rappeler que l'État avait été tout aussi violent avec eux (confiscation de biens, meurtres, et toute la violence verbale jusqu'au début du siècle).

Par exemple, il est évident que le voile n'a rien d'obligatoire et qu'il faudra tôt ou tard que les musulmanes de France l'abandonnent. Tout comme pour la polygamie et l'excision, ils vont devoir cesser ces traditions (qui n'ont rien à voir avec leur foi).

&gt;Quand Sarkozy s'est déclaré pour la création d'un Islam de France et la construction de lieux de cultes, tout le monde lui est tombé dessus

C'est tout simplement contraire à la ~~Constitution~~ *loi de 1905*. On sait bien que c'était le cadet de ses soucis, mais c'est normal de lui tomber dessus.

&gt;Le CFCM a rapidement été grippé par des conflits internes et de fortes dépendances de l'étranger

Et voilà une face importante du problème. L'enjeu de l'Islam en France, c'est aussi une affaire d'influence étrangère sur une partie de la population française. C'est totalement contraire à la loi française et il est normal de s'y opposer.

Et puis il y a cette erreur fondamentale de nos politiques : [ils essaient de calquer un modèle gallican sur l'Islam](http://www.causeur.fr/la-formation-des-imams-fantasme-des-ministres-de-linterieur,24993#) (instant edit : on avait le même lien !).

&gt;Construire une mosquée en France prend toujours des années et génère une guerre larvée entre les élites locales

Comme pour tout édifice.

La construction de mosquées prend des années, mais celle des cathédrales et églises a pris des siècles. C'est un argument d'enfant gâté. 

Le paysan payait sa dîme et n'avait pas le choix, qu'on ne vienne pas me dire que son niveau de vie était meilleur que celui du musulman moyen. Ils n'ont qu'à se démerder et être patients, ça fait même pas 50 ans qu'on a une présence musulmane significative et on a déjà [plus de 2200 mosquées](http://www.patrimoine-religieux.fr/rubriques/gauche/liens/reportages-analyses/analyse-mosquees-un-patrimoine-en-devenir/?searchterm=mosquees), faut pas exagérer quand même.

Do you have a better suggestion as to how the interests of less-populated regions should be protected? The densely-populated regions already have an overwhelming control over the Lower House and the election of the President. Giving less-populated states an equal say in the Upper House allows people in less populated states to protect themselves from being exploited by the masses on the coasts.

Remember, the United States is a federation of nominally sovereign states. The Constitution was designed to ensure that the most populous states wouldn't be able to trample over the rights of the less populous states. The Upper House is where each *state* has an equal say. The populations aren't being represented in the Senate: the states are. It's not about ensuring that ""rural areas"" have a say, since some less-populous states are highly urban, like Rhode Island, Delaware, or Hawaii.

These two things combined means that ""high fructose corn syrup"" is used in many US food products as a substitute for sugar because with the subsidies and tariffs, corn becomes vastly cheaper.

And policies enacted at the Federal level like welfare spending and countless other federal programs have made the federal government in control of far more than a confederation of republics would normally be.

The arrogation of power in the US to the federal government was not the result of a deliberate, considered decision by the public, though. It is the result of two centuries of struggle between the federal and the state governments, with the federal government winning more and more power over time. There was no vote on whether to maintain a real federal system or to allow the Union to become a unitary state in fact.

&gt; In the past and in the crafting of the Constitution, the US was designed to be a grouping of sovereign states. After the Civil War, though, this was no longer the case in practice. Yet formally, our structure still weights votes depending on location based on a system that hasn't been around in reality in 150 years.

My rebuttal is that although the federal government has power *de facto* like that of a unitary state, *de jure* much of the power in the US belongs to the states, and there is still a substantial proportion of the US who maintain the idea that the government should be operating on the basis of the Constitution as written, and that the overwhelming power the federal government currently has is an aberration of what the federal government *ought* to be doing. You may think it's silly to adhere to a system that ""hasn't been around in reality in 150 years,"" but I think it's equally silly (if not dangerous) to just throw away or cherry-pick the constitutional basis of our government just because the federal government has *de facto* overreached and gained near-complete control over the Republic, when the constitutional allocations of powers to the federal government were intended precisely to *limit* the power of the federal government.",0,1387084093,null,0,false,0,ce21pm5,t3_1sv5h0,t1_ce21pm5,t1_ce20zfu,null,1428128306,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Apparently the request had intentionally been written to make it appear to be about bittorrent.

And this is where it gets even more interesting. This tool could not have possibly been used to get the IPs. So the question is where they came from. Several users have analysed their Web history, and there's a pattern of a redirect service from which you can buy region specific porn traffic (you know, one of those that redirects you to another site when you click on a preview image), to a freshly registered redtube.*net* (or something like that) domain, to the movies in question on Redtube proper. Then someone checked the view counter for those on Archive.org and noticed that views for those specific clips doubled the day the typobait domain had been registered.

Klar, auch die Rechte und die Neokonservative hat ihre Argumente, die möglicherweise auch stichhaltig klingen. Doch die Vergangenheit und Gegenwart zeigen, dass diese Argumente eben nicht stichhaltig sind. Die Politik des permanenten, unkontrollierten wirtschaftlichen Wachstums ist gescheitert. Sie kann nicht auf Dauer funktionieren, weil irgendwann Schluss sein **muss** mit Wachstum. Spätestens, wenn die das Wachstum erzeugende Mittelschicht nicht mehr ausreichend vom Wachstum profitiert, gezwungen werden muss oder weg bricht. Da führt der Weg des unkontrollierten Turbokapitalismus leider zwangsläufig hin. Ein immer mehr über seine Belastbarkeit hinaus beanspruchtes System fliegt uns irgendwann um die Ohren. Dem Gefühl nach ist das auch gar nicht mehr lange hin. 

Eine etwas gemäßigtere, gerechtere Politik, die der Arbeit des Mittelstandes Rechnung trägt und auch die Unterschicht nicht vergisst, wäre durchaus angeraten, und die kommt halt von links. 

Argument dafür wäre, dass eine gesunde, zufriedene Bevölkerung sicher noch produktiver sein könnte als eine kranke Bevölkerung, die zur Arbeit gezwungen werden muss (Hartz IV ist nichts anderes als Sklaverei, Zwangsarbeit).

&gt; Participation in ERM II is voluntary although, as one of the convergence criteria for entry to the euro area, a country must participate in the mechanism without severe tensions for at least two years before it can qualify to adopt the euro.

A commitment to join the Euro is a commitment in principle - countries join when both they and the EC agree that the convergence criteria have been met.

It is not imposed unilaterally on joining the EU.",0,1387101212,null,0,false,0,ce25own,t3_1sv3bh,t1_ce25own,t1_ce23uop,null,1428126376,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

* Cyprus experienced sudden onset winter early this week, lasting for two days. Winds of ~45km/h, rain in most areas, snowfall in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, including the capital city. Average temp of +8°C, -3°C in Mt Troodos. Not our usual winter weather, so services weren't ready.

* The parliament keeps postponing the vote to limit the number of luxury cars available to state officials.  This motion is sabotaged by all parties that have been ruling at least once, even though they all initially agreed that when the country is in this financial ruins, state officials shouldn't have all luxury cars. In the latest draft, they actually increased the number of officials entitled luxury cars. The voting was postponed for mid-January.

* Cypriot economist, Nobel prize winner Pissarides, giving a speech before London School of Economics said that Eurozone must become a transfers union, austerity has failed, and any more of the same will be as good as sitting around waiting for the Euro to self-destruct. While his views are far from original, it would be interesting to see how the pro-austerity-as-only-solution Cypriot government react to one of their close advisers defecting to the opposite side of the debate [[Ph]](http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/top-stories/885/175912/pissaridis-to-evro-prepei-na-dialythei)  

* The Church “cheated” the government into paying part of the priests salary in rural areas (the amount cannot be calculated accurately, but it's about 200 billions starting from 1971). According to this agreement, the Church would transfer land of equivalent value to the state, but they didn't do so in 42 years. The state is also seeking to revise the agreement because many areas that were classed as rural in 1971 are now urban centres. Past attempts failed and the state had to make unilateral changes. The agreement was signed by President Makarios III and Archbishop Makarios III (yes, the same guy was both) [[Ph]](http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/koinonia-eidiseis/160/175371/1014-ekat-apo-to-kratos-se-misthous-iereon)

* Archbishop of Cyprus (and a number of Greek bishops) is implicated in assisting neonazis by the leader of Golden Dawn in a video proof examined during his trial in Greece. More specifically, the leader of the party pictures him as instrumental in the electoral rise of the Cypriot branch of GD (“ELAM”). That comes as no surprise though, since the Archbishop of Cyprus expressed his support, with the famous quote “Most of ELAM's positions are crystal clear and I can get behind them”. The Archbishop began distancing himself from GD after a Greek singer was murdered by a member of the party allegedly operating under the party's orders, while still using the same rhetoric, and has in fact denied that GD leader's video statements are true.

* The President unveiled a 340 million EUR stimulus pack for 2014. It's centred around subsidised employment, with the government paying up to 70% of the salary of new hires for 10 months, if certain criteria are met (mostly: long-term unemployed and young people with no work experience). A smaller scale stimulus of similar nature was hastily put in place after March 2013, but it failed to get more people in the job market the past summer, and opposition parties predict the same fate for next year [[CM]](http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/12/11/president-unveils-e340mln-stimulus-package/)

* The Cypriot government moves to racially segregate a state-run orphanage, sending the orphaned kids of African descent to a different city, away from the Cypriot kids. The development was upsetting for the kids, who have developed close friendships over the years, and for the people supervising the education of those kids, because mixed-race orphanages had positive impact in integrating non-native Greek speakers into Greek-language schools. [[ThO]](http://www.tothemaonline.com/koinonia/ksespitwnoun-anilikous-afrikanous) 

* The T/C side once again rejects the common statement (of accepting the compromises of previous negotiations) prior the new round of negotiations. The points of disagreement are single vs multiple citizenships, continuity vs succession of the 1960 Republic of Cyprus and federation of communities vs confederation of countries, with T/Cs insisting on the options that offer greater autonomy [[Ph]](http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/eidiseis-politiki/39/175662/ochi-apo-tin-tk-plevra-sto-anakoinothen-tou-proedrou)

&gt; A Milano, a seguito dell’aumento del costo della farina e del pane, gravati dall’esosissima tassa sul macinato, imposta dal regno sabaudo, il popolo affamato insorse e assaltò i forni del pane. 
&gt; L’insurrezione durò vari giorni e fu repressa nel sangue con i fucili e i cannoni dai Carabinieri al comando del generale piemontese Bava Beccaris [4], che poi per questa azione di ordine pubblico fu insignito con la Croce di grand'ufficiale dell'ordine militare di Savoia, «per rimettere il servizio reso alle istituzioni e alla civiltà"" da Umberto I re d’Italia». Nella feroce repressione militare si calcola che vi furono piú di trecento insorti uccisi (i dati non sono precisi) e centinaia di feriti.
&gt; 
&gt; Gaetano Bresci, secondo la filosofia di un certo anarchismo militante, intese vendicare l’eccidio e rendere giustizia, perciò uccise il Re Umberto I di Savoia in quanto responsabile in capo di questi tragici avvenimenti.

Bonjour l'amalgame. 

**Excision** : En France, l’excision est un délit passible de dix ans d’emprisonnement, de 150 000 euros d’amende et d'une interdiction de territoire de cinq ans.  Selon l'INED, 50 000 personnes seraient touchées. Si les excisions clandestines n’ont pas totalement disparu dans l'Hexagone, la répression et l’action judicaire ont entraîné un net recul de l'excision chez les jeunes immigrées.

Deux (légers) problèmes concernant l'amalgame Islam en France-Excision :

1) Ces mutilations n'ont pour l'essentiel pas eu lieu en France.

&gt; En Afrique l'excision a cours dans 28 pays. Treize pays disposent de lois réprimant les mutilations sexuelles, selon l'Unicef. L'ablation du clitoris reste la règle en Somalie où 98% des femmes de 15 à 49 ans ont été excisées, en Guinée (96%), à Djibouti (93%), en Egypte (93%). En Ethiopie, en Erythrée, en Sierra Leone au Soudan et au Mali donc, la grande majorité des femmes est excisée.

&gt; Dans une moindre mesure, on excise aussi au Burkina Faso, en Centrafrique, en Côte d’Ivoire, au Kenya, en Gambie ou en Guinée-Bissau. Enfin, cette pratique concerne quelques minorités ethniques au Bénin, au Cameroun, au Ghana, au Niger, en Ouganda, au Togo, en Tanzanie, en RDC et au Nigeria. Dans ces pays, la proportion de femmes excisées est inférieure à 25%.

[*Source : article RFI à la veille de la Journée de lutte contre les violences faites aux femmes*](http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20131124-manifestation-excision-femmes-france-mutilation-sexuelle-genitale-afrique-clitoris-mali)

Sur ces 50 000 cas déclarés, la majeure partie a été mutilée dans son pays d'origine ou à la suite d'un voyage au pays.

2) Ce n'est pas une pratique cautionnée par l'Islam
&gt; ...à l'origine, l'excision n'est pas une affaire de religion. « Il ne faut pas faire d’amalgame entre religion et excision, insiste d'ailleurs Koudedia Keïta, présidente de l'association Marche en corps. Cette pratique est antérieure aux religions monothéistes. C’est l’ignorance qui fait que l’on continue de mutiler. Mais aucune religion n’oblige à exciser ». Et le Coran ne fait pas mention de cette pratique.

Concernant ces délits clandestins en France, « On a identifié des lieux qui pratiquent l’excision, souvent liés aux milieux salafistes"" dit Frédérique Schwartz qui anime une organisation en réseau de professionnels de santé et de la société civile. ""Depuis les "" Printemps arabes "", nous avons vu apparaître les premiers cas de femmes issues de pays comme la Tunisie, où ce n’est pas une pratique traditionnelle. Mais la remontée de la mouvance salafiste a réintégré une notion religieuse qui fait que les pratiques changent ».

Assimiler tout musulman de France à un salafiste, ça revient à traiter les 41,5 millions de Français qui se déclarent catholiques ([chiffres 2009](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89glise_catholique_en_France)) de catholiques intégristes militant tous chez [Civitas](http://quoi.info/actualite-societe/2012/11/19/catholiques-integristes-civitas-manifestation-mariage-homosexuel-1111680/). Je sais que c'est un fantasme du Front National, mais faudrait quand même pas pousser !

**Polygamie** : Quant à la polygamie, elle non plus n'est pas autorisée en France ni par mariage, ni par PACS. En revanche, les mariages contractés à l'étranger, y compris les mariages polygames, ont force de droit, entre les parties uniquement. Pour qu'un mariage, ou tout autre contrat soumis à une réglementation étrangère, puisse recevoir autorité en France, cet acte devra être soumis à exequatur, c'est-à-dire à homologation par le juge français. 

Or depuis la loi Pasqua de 1993, les familles polygames en France doivent choisir entre le divorce et la décohabitation ou le non-renouvellement de leur carte de séjour, et donc, ipso facto, le caractère irrégulier de leur présence sur le territoire.

Dans certains cas, le fait de vivre en « état de polygamie » est une cause d'exclusion à l'accès à la nationalité française (Article L313-11 du Code de l'entrée et du séjour des étrangers et du droit d'asile).

* a new law passed that **changes some definitions of corruption in politics**: for instance, the elected politicians are no longer defined ""public servants"", therefore they are immune for a series of crimes (such as ""abuse of power"", ""conflict of interests"", etc). Various western countries and western politicians said it's a step backwards and urged the Romanian government to change its mind.
* a law was discussed about **amnesty and exoneration** for a series of crimes (including **corruption**).  Again, people were outraged, but for this, they postponed the voting of the law.
* because of the previous two, there'll be another protest later today (starting 4-5 PM in Bucharest) against corruption. Of course it won't solve anything, but at least it will give a hint to politicians that they are being watched. :)
* the changes to the mining law (which allowed expropriation of private-owned land by private mining corporations and made some exceptions from the environmental protection laws for mining) did not reach the needed votes in the parliament. This followed months-long protests across Romania. Leaders of the ruling social-democrats blamed the ""extremists from the street"" for this.
* **protests against shale gas continued** in Pungești, Vaslui County, while Chevron began drilling. The gendarmes (militarized riot police) are monitoring very closely (at one point, they had a policeman at each house who would ask everyone who entered/exit where they were going) and they disallow some basic rights (such as groups of more than 2 people in public).
* Daniel Barbu, **the minister of culture resigned** this week, following some comments about how the budget for AIDS patients is too high and that if it were halfed and given instead to the culture ministry, he'd have enough funds for some Shakespeare festival. Of course, this was found outrageous by virtually everyone and he was forced by his party to resign.

true,Omnilatent,null,null,"&gt;  It's not clear from where the lawyers got the data and if anyone really has to pay but many do. It's the first time someone succeeds to get money from people for streaming videos.

It is actually. That's what I know so far (and I hope I understood it correctly - I'm no IT-pro though):

There was a swiss company that bought the rights for at least two porn movies, then the company sold the rights to some german guy. After that, the views on the videos skyrocketed - most likely because the german guy send emails with malware to his victims beforehand. This malware used a script to load certain websites into the browser cache. The site was then loaded over the server of the perpetrator, revealing the IP-addresses of his victims to him.

Then, a german lawyer went to the prosecution in cologne, saying he has evidence for those people using ""file-sharing"" for distributing movies which are owned by his client. This way, he got the real addresses of roughly 60.000 people.

However, this is complete bullshit since redtube is of course no file-sharing site and streaming means downloading a file into your browser cache, which is a basic principle of the internet and therefore not illegal in german law.

Couple minutes ago, I read that the lawyer and the copyright owner of these porn movies just lost their first trial which will be most likely a leading case. The client/lawyer (right now not clear if they are in cahoots together) used illegal ways for getting the IP-addresses of his victims and lied to the prosecution. This is clearly a fraud. 

I watched a lot of youtube videos about that, these two here are the most important ones, telling the background story. They are unfortunately in german only but what I wrote above is based on those, so non-german speakers might not miss that much.

When I was a child my parents were street market sellers. It is a harsh job that provides a meager income, and usually the whole family is involved, as you work every single day, from morning to past midnight in some cases. A huge part of the gypsy community makes their living as street sellers.

Until the late 80s, early 90s (can't remember the year exactly) street markets were mostly unregulated. There were certain areas and days you could sell, and you were expected to pay your income tax every year, and that was it. Then they regulated it so, to sell your wares, you needed to apply and pay a steep monthly license, and in some places you had to adapt your stall to certain specifications at your own cost (hint: not cheap). Plus, every single person over 16 that might, at any given moment, work in the stall had to pay the self-employed fee every month.

Now, I don't how how much you know about Spain's self-employment regulations, but they were and still are insane. You have to pay a minimum of 230€/month (they've introduced some discounts now for women and people under 30, so maybe 180€/month) regardless of if you even earn that much or not. And kids under 16 couldn't ever be in charge of the stall. This might sound reasonable, because child labor is a bad thing, but in this case it's not. It was not uncommon to have to take over the stall for ten minutes while your mom went to the nearest pub to pee, or to the van to replace some merchandise. As a street market kid, I can say that it was not exploitative at all. The new regulation effectively barred that. 

How can I best describe how hard a hit this was for street sellers? I remember my mom saying she needed to talk to someone because she had been asked for a 60000 pesetas/month self-employment fee. 60000 pesetas was our house's **yearly** rent! When my family splurged on a second-hand van expected to last 8 or 10 years, they spent 100000 pesetas! There was absolutely no way my family could afford that, monthly, twice (because my stepdad had to pay as well), we didn't even make that much money!

My family got lucky because my mom actually made the jewelry she sold, so they could apply to pay the artisan fee, much lower than the self-employed fee, and since my mom's family was well off she asked her parents for a loan for the yearly selling permit. But most people didn't manufacture their merchandise or have affluent parents. 

So a lot of people left the business. Some of them opened their own shops or were hired as shopkeepers, since they had a lot of experience in sales, but this being twenty years ago, racism was alive and well. No employer was about to hire a gypsy, and no landlord would rent a shop to them. So a lot of gypsies lost their livelihoods and were only left scrap metal collecting, begging or less honest ways to make a living. 

**TL;DR - Street sellers don't make enough money to pay high fees, if you ask them for exorbitant fees they'll have to find something else to do. And in the 80s no one hired gypsies, so what did the government expect?**",0,1387114859,null,0,1387115190,0,ce27ixw,t3_1svba7,t1_ce27ixw,t1_ce1rv4h,null,1428125520,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Vielmehr ist in allen drei Artikeln die Rede davon, dass die große Koalition unter bestimmten Vorraussetzungen denkbar ist. (Ob diese Vorraussetzungen alle erfüllt sind, kann man gerne an anderer Stelle diskutieren.)

Vielleicht macht ein Interview in Wortlauten die Positionierung deutlicher:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o46DLOK3H8 [Frage kommt ab 15:20m]

Ich möchte lediglich erinnern, daß gerade Herr Gabriel gegenüber der Regierung seither das ""Wir können's besser!"" Mantra wider gekaut hat. Also schon länger: Siehe http://www.merkur-online.de/aktuelles/politik/spd-chef-gabriel-neuwahlen-ja-grosse-koalition-nein-817597.html Ob das nun diente, um sein politisches Profil zu wahren oder sich zu profilieren sei mal dahin gestellt.

Wenn ich jetzt vorgehalten bekomme, wie man ""vor der Wahl"" und ""unmittelbar vor der Wahl"" definiert, oder, daß er mit seiner Antwort aus dem ersten Interview aber einer GroKo nicht explizit widerspricht [ weil er unmittelbar vor der Wahl komischerweise vage taktiert und auch der Behauptung des Interviewers nicht widerspricht] dann bin ich aus der Diskussion raus, weil mir das ehrlich gesagt zu kleinkariert und ölig wäre.

&gt;Fun-fact: Die hier oft gewünschte rot-rot-grüne Koalltion wurde im Gegensatz zur GroKo von der SPD explizit ausgeschlossen.

I discussed the matter with them, and surprise! surprise! you **can** get prosecuted for streaming and downloading, because each act of copying and downloading involves making a copy somewhere.

Source: *GRUR 2011, 4096 - Thomas Busch: Zur urheberrechtlichen Einordnung von Streamingangeboten*. The GRUR (commercial rights and copyright law) is from the publishing house C. H. Beck, and this is like the gold standard here in Germany for law.

Even with streaming, you could assemble a full copy from the stream, which makes it a copy which can be regulated by the rights of the copyright holder.

The lawmakers intentionally put this in so you cannot get a copy of obviously illegal material, like in cases where people downloaded full movies at the release date.

Earlier on, the cases were only for p2p, because with uploading and distributing, the damages were much larger. Now, this has dried out. One of the insiders said in an [article of the paper *Die WELT*](http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article122935946/Nicht-nur-Redtube-Nutzern-drohen-Porno-Abmahnungen.html) [in German] that they go now for streaming since they cannot get any money from p2p now.

The best way of action is to challenge the court order (it was misleading and disguised as p2p when it was not) or claim that you couldn't assume that the material was copyrighted.

EDIT: Just to expand a little, the real source of the IPs are from bribed admins at the porn portal, according to the insider. The court orders were just needed to give a legal mantle for acquiring the IP addresses.

true,Zeebaars,NETH,The Netherlands,"Well, presumably you'd lose it. /u/JB_UK's link reflects what the European Commission has to say about this. Your EU-citizenship is derived from your UK citizenship, as (per Art. 20 TFEU):
&gt;""Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship.""

If/when Scotland secedes from the United Kingdom, the citizens of Scotland lose their UK citizenship in favor of a Scottish citizenship, and with it their EU citizenship derived from the UK's status as a member state. That is the official word. Mind you, these people have to work with leaders and representatives from the UK, Belgium and Spain, who are trying to deal with serious secessionist movements. Openly endorsing or legitimizing/encouraging secessionists will damage their position. 

There are a few things that come into play here. Comparison with say Albania or Turkey is not fair. Those countries do not meet accession criteria and certain member states are opposed to them joining. I'm going to assume that Scotland has no major impediments to meeting the criteria for joining (even though that depends on how the new Scottish state and constitution is set up) and no one would protest to Scotland (re-)joining. The same problem kind of holds true for your currency, will you keep using the GBP, will you introduce a Scottish currency or will you use the Euro as tender resembling a way that [Kosovo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo#Economy) does before a formal accession? 

How this transition is given form and what it means for your citizenship depends largely on what terms Scotland secedes from the UK and the EU. The treaties imply you lose your citizenship, however the new Scotland as a country will presumably meet the [accession criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_criteria) and would fly through the [admission process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union#Process). [Finland, for example, was fast-tracked into the EU in three years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_enlargement_of_the_European_Union), which they needed to make the legal adjustments necessary and hold a referendum. I assume that all of these things will be formally and publicly negotiated in the case that the referendum decides there's actually going to be an independent Scotland following the referendum (you can imagine that this is a precarious topic in Europe for the aforementioned MS dealing with secessionists.), and whether a hypothetical EU admission track is going to be part of the secession process in some form or another. If EU citizenship is important to you, consider the possibility that you may lose that citizenship. 

tl;dr: legally you'd lose it, but depending on the terms and conditions under which Scotland would succeed the implications can be widely disparate. Scotland is not Albania or Kosovo, and I assume no major impediments would exist for Scotland making a quick re-entry (if not symbolically instant). All speculation. Take it into consideration when you vote! I hope that helps...

I'm actually rather jealous of European countries that have the option of both engaging with global debate, and then their own local debate in a language which is separate.

So the key question comes down to how far you can go, while still keeping the foundations of a language intact. How much 'domain loss' a language can withstand before it starts to lose integrity.

* We had a [rainbow](http://galeria.index.hu/tudomany/2013/12/09/szivarvanyos_hetfo_reggel_budapesten/) over Budapest on Monday and people went apeshit about it. 

* In a very obvious build-up to the upcoming elections, Fidesz is proposing to[ lower the personal income tax](http://www.politics.hu/20131209/govt-aims-for-single-digit-personal-income-tax-rate/) rate to be single digit (likely 9), down from the current 16. 

* Former Jobbik MP turned Jewish rights speaker, [Csanád Szegedi was refused entry to Canada](http://www.politics.hu/20131210/former-far-right-politician-who-discovered-his-jewish-roots-refused-entrance-to-canada/) after a local Canadian-Hungarian reported him to the immigration authorities. He went to make a speech about his transformation at the local Chabad group. As the process to determine the validity of the report takes 3 weeks, he was forced to return to Hungary within 24 hours after arrival, but he says he did make the speech, though there are contradicting reports. 

* The first democratically elected PM, [József Antall died 20 years ago](http://www.politics.hu/20131212/ader-marks-late-pm-antalls-20th-death-anniversary/). His death announcement is remembered by many young adults, as it interrupted the Sunday afternoon cartoon block's big hit: DuckTales. I, too, was very upset about it. 

* Orbán's crazy obsession with football is thriving, we are now basically [upgrading and building new football stadiums](http://www.politics.hu/20131210/parliament-lays-aside-12bn-huf-for-stadium-projects-more-funding-expected/) for any sizeable city with a half-decent football team (half-decent by our shitty standards). Another 12bHUF approved on top of the 21b in next year's budget to the development of 26 stadiums for a total of 110m€. 

* A far less important problem, the asylum seekers' got a [1.5m€ extra funding](http://www.hungarianambiance.com/2013/12/huf-440-million-emergency-fund-has-been.html). Because of a change in EU regulations, by the end of the year we'll handle over 20.000 refugees, up by about 1000% from past years' ~2000. 

* [Eleven new casinos can be opened](http://www.politics.hu/20131210/lawmakers-give-go-ahead-to-eleven-casinos/) in a fast-track, no-tender-needed decision by Fidesz, after they realized the banning of slot machines in pubs created a huge gap in tax income.

* [Fidesz MPs took off the VAT scandal from the Parliamentary Assembly's agend](http://www.politics.hu/20131211/fidesz-takes-vat-allegations-off-parliament-committee-agenda/)a with little explanation and are pretending to be ridiculously concerned about the national aspects of the NSA scandal. ""Governing-party MPs are creating the impression that they have something to cover up"", said an opposition MP. 

* The biggest far-right extremist news website, kuruc.info purchased a billboard in a central location of Budapest. After a major, left leaning news site reported this the billboard was taken down. The journalist received death threats and harassing phone calls for 3 days. 

* We won a lot of golds at the short course swimming European Championship, but the women's handball team at the World Championship in Serbia is shit and will likely be eliminated in the upcoming game on Monday against Spain.

As an adverb, it usually refers to actions. It cannot be declined and has two main meanings:

* **""really"", ""indeed""**. ""Questo libro è proprio interessante"" means ""This book is really interesting"". ""Sei proprio divertente"" means ""You are really funny"".

* **""exactly""**. ""Questo libro è proprio quello che cercavo!"" means ""This book is exactly what I was looking for!"".

The distinction between the two meanings is sometimes blurry, but it is usually clear from context.

As an adjective, it refers to nouns and can be declined (masculine plural: *propri*, feminine singular: *propria*, feminine plural: *proprie*). Its prevalent meaning is: **""own""**. For example: ""Ognuno pensa ai propri problemi"" means ""Everybody thinks about their own problems"". Notice that ""their"" is not translated: the possessive adjective is always removed (I can't think of any exception at the moment).

The adjective *proprio* is used almost exclusively when you are talking about a third person (""his own"", ""her own"", ""its own"", ""their own"").

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; English as the language of science, of regional (but not national) politics, of business, of education? Where do you need to stop before you render the local language unsustainable? If this occurs early, then English needs to be blocked at an early stage.

I'm not sure all countries even have a choice on some of these questions, though. Japan, for example, has its own computer-science and engineering journals, in Japanese. This is partly because English fluency in Japan is much lower than in Europe, and partly because there is enough critical mass to sustain Japanese journals: there are about 125 million native speakers, and there's is a lot of technology research in Japan.

I hear that's also true to some extent with French-language CS research. But is there any possible future in which Danish-language CS research makes sense? An independent scientific field only in Denmark, with its own independent literature in Danish, conferences in Danish, citations mainly to other Danish researchers, etc., like the Japanese literature works? There are fewer than 6 million native speakers of the language, which I'm not sure is enough for a sustainable scientific literature independent from the international research literature (which in practice means in English).

Maybe if some of the languages were more consolidated it could work. A pan-Scandinavian CS journal might come closer to critical mass, and written Norwegian/Swedish/Danish are close enough that it could be read across the region. But there doesn't seem to be that much interest. In part because the language doesn't perfectly line up with the regional integration people do have an interest in. There is some interest in fostering a little independent Nordic scientific community, but we want the Finns to be part of it, and their language isn't Scandinavian.
