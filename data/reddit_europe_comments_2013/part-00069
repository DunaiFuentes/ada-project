German carriers use GSM 900/1800 UMTS 2100 and LTE 800
LTE is also used at 1800 MHz by the Deutsche Telekom, but I would not fall for that, 3G/3.5G is quite enough to get around and LTE is still rare

Most importantly there is a mandatory full checkup of any car in Germany, the TüV, and it is quite easy to fail with an older car.

If you have access to a shop (some military communities offer such things) getting and old VW Golf MK3 1.8L might be the right choice. YOu will be able to to basically anything on your own on the car (said you haven't 2 left hands /r/doesnottranslate ) but parts for Golf Mk3s are REALLY cheap and the only main issue with them is RUST lots and lots of rust :P so check for rust everywhere and worn out rubber bearings on the axles. The 1.8L engine is quite a runner, and is even with ≥180kkm still fine to buy as long as it runs fine but expect it to burn quite some oil (which is not too bad, oil is cheap) and it needs ~9L/100km, so not a cheap driver for long or daily distances.

But as said, any replacement/spare part for an VW Golf Mk3 will be cheap as hell, all wear parts on the front axle come in for ~150€ :P
and there are a lot of scrap yard selling used non waer parts as pumps, lights and stuff, and parts are cheap because there are so many dead and living Mk3s.

Pour la première fois, Marine Le Pen est prise aux filets. La révélation du rôle direct de son conseiller, l'avocat Philippe Péninque, dans l’ouverture du compte de Jérôme Cahuzac, aurait de quoi stopper net ses plaidoiries contre « la caste » et « l’oligarchie ». Quelques heures avant l’annonce de l’implication de Philippe Péninque, elle assurait encore n’avoir « pas d’amis chez les grands patrons », « pas d’amis dans la grande finance ou dans les grands laboratoires pharmaceutiques », et offrait cette « garantie » pour gouverner sans renvoi d’ascenseur.

Selon une série de documents obtenus par Mediapart, le président d’honneur du FN et député européen Jean-Marie Le Pen se trouve pourtant dans la même position que François Hollande et son trésorier de campagne, Jean-Jacques Augier, actionnaire de deux sociétés aux îles Caïmans, selon les fichiers Offshore Leaks révélés par Le Monde. L’ancien trésorier du micro-parti, Cotelec, l’éditeur Jean-Pierre Mouchard, a utilisé dans les années 1990 les services de plusieurs sociétés offshore, Overseas Property Services Limited à Gibraltar, et la panaméenne Hadret al Raiss.

Vieil ami du fondateur du FN, Mouchard avait déjà ouvert un compte à l’Union des Banques suisses (UBS) pour Jean-Marie Le Pen, en mars 1981. Répondant aux questions de Mediapart, Marine Le Pen justifie l’ouverture de ce compte suisse par « un emprunt souscrit à l’UBS ». Quant à Jean-Marie Le Pen, il en conteste purement et simplement l’existence.

L'Union des Banques Suisses (UBS).© Reuters

Les documents d’ouverture de ce compte numéro 386.047.00.W, révélés par feu L’Evénement du jeudi (lire notre Boîte noire), portent pourtant bel et bien la signature de Jean-Marie Le Pen. Dans un premier document du 10 mars 1981, M. Mouchard apparaît comme le titulaire du compte et M. Le Pen comme son représentant (voir le premier document). Puis, dans un second document daté du 11 décembre 1981, M. Mouchard déclare « agir pour le compte de M. Le Pen » (voir le second document).

Le premier document, daté du 10 mars 1981.


Le second document, daté du 11 décembre 1981.

Joint par Mediapart, Jean-Marie Le Pen s’étonne : « Le compte de Jean-Pierre Mouchard, c’est Jean-Pierre Mouchard. Je ne suis pas Jean-Pierre Mouchard, moi ! Il ne peut pas y avoir d’ouverture de compte de M. Mouchard au nom de M. Le Pen », assure-t-il. Avant d’évoquer une autre hypothèse : cette opération serait liée à sa société d’édition de disques, la Société d’études et de relations publiques (Serp).

« La Serp a contracté un emprunt, je ne me souviens plus en quelle année, tout cela s’est fait dans le cadre de la loi, avec intervention des autorités françaises, poursuit-il. C’est une affaire entre UBS et la Serp.

Le hic, c’est que d’autres documents en notre possession attestent que deux millions de francs environ étaient encore déposés sur le compte 386.047.00.W entre juin 1984 et avril 1986, sous la forme de placements fiduciaires.

Relevé des opérations sur le compte Mouchard/Le Pen.

Le trésorier a utilisé les services d’une société offshore de Gibraltar
« Non, il n’y avait pas deux millions de francs, rétorque Jean-Marie Le Pen. La Serp s’est servie de cet emprunt et l’a remboursé dans les années qui ont suivi. Cotelec n’a strictement rien à voir là-dedans. » « De ce que j’en sais, ce compte était parfaitement légal et déclaré », assure de son côté Marine Le Pen, contredisant son père. « Ce que je peux vous dire, c’est qu’il a fait un emprunt à l’UBS, déclare-t-elle à Mediapart. Ce n’est pas parce qu’on a un père, un frère, qu’on connaît l’intégralité des détails de leur existence patrimoniale. Je n’en sais strictement rien. »

Mediapart a demandé des précisions à M. Le Pen sur le montant de ce prêt, son remboursement et sa clôture. En réponse, son cabinet nous a indiqué qu’il « ne dispose d’aucune des archives de la société Serp, dont il a quitté la gérance en novembre 1999 », et que « cette même société a été liquidée judiciairement en 2000 ». Les Le Pen père et fille laissent donc en suspens toutes les interrogations sur l'ouverture de ce compte et sa gestion.

Mais ce n'est pas la seule zone d'ombre. Le parcours de Jean-Pierre Mouchard, l’ami trésorier, est tout aussi énigmatique. Membre du premier cercle de Le Pen, il est, officiellement, fondateur de plusieurs maisons d’édition et de vente de livres par correspondance, aujourd’hui liquidées – François Beauval, Crémille, Famot… – et s’est spécialisé dans la publication d’ouvrages libres de droit : Zola, Dumas, Dostoïevski. En association avec la société de Le Pen, il publie L’Encyclopédie sonore de la Seconde Guerre mondiale et édite, à la même époque, la revue Dans la coulisse de Roland Gaucher, futur directeur de National hebdo.

En 1988, Mouchard devient trésorier de l’association Jean-Marie Le Pen Cotelec (pour « cotisation électorale »). C’est cette qualité d’animateur du micro-parti qui place Jean-Pierre Mouchard dans une position similaire à celle du trésorier de campagne de François Hollande, Jean-Jacques Augier, aujourd’hui. Alors que ce dernier est l’actionnaire de deux sociétés aux îles Caïmans, Mouchard a utilisé les services d'Overseas Property Services Limited, une société offshore de Gibraltar, qui figure sur la liste « gris foncé » des paradis fiscaux établie par l'OCDE.

Selon des documents en notre possession, l’éditeur et trésorier opère dans les années 1990 des virements internationaux via Overseas Property Services Ltd à Gibraltar, pour renflouer l’une de ses maisons d’édition française, Magellan. Ces opérations sont gérées par une société fiduciaire de Gibraltar, Isola et Isola. Cette société atteste en 1993 d’un certificat de propriété des actions de Jean-Pierre Mouchard dans la société panaméenne Hadret al Raiss (voir notre document ci-dessous). Le Panama était jusqu'en 2012 sur la « liste grise » des paradis fiscaux de l'OCDE.


Un courrier de la société fiduciaire gérant la société panaméenne de J.-P. Mouchard.
« M. Mouchard n’a jamais été président des comptes de la présidentielle de quiconque », s’insurge Marine Le Pen. Ce n’est donc pas « la même sauce que le trésorier de campagne de Hollande », prévient-elle. « M. Mouchard était trésorier de campagne ? Non. Je ne me sens pas responsable des investissements que M. Mouchard a effectués il y a 25 ans, lorsque je n’avais aucune responsabilité. M. Mouchard a-t-il été condamné pour favoritisme ? A-t-il une responsabilité politique au Front national ? Faites les amalgames que vous voulez et on en discutera devant le tribunal correctionnel, je n’ai aucun problème là-dessus. »

Aucun amalgame : Cotelec, le micro-parti animé par Mouchard, contribue – officiellement dès 1991 – au financement du FN, lui apportant les dons de sympathisants et militants collectés par le parti. Les coordonnées de Cotelec figurent alors souvent en bas des tracts. C'est une forme de contrôle direct de sa trésorerie par Le Pen, Mouchard n’ayant aucune fonction dans l’appareil du parti. La structure, que Mouchard a quittée en 1997, reste aujourd’hui encore sous le contrôle du président d'honneur du FN et continue d'alimenter le parti (Cotelec a apporté au FN 415 387 euros de dons de personnes physiques en 2007, et en 2008, il est le second micro-parti français à avoir récolté le plus de dons).

Au moment de la révélation des fichiers Offshore Leaks, Louis Aliot, vice-président du Front national, avait dénoncé « la gauche caïman ! ». « Après les affaires Guérini et consorts, les conséquences de l’affaire Cahuzac, ne voilà-t-il pas que le trésorier de sa campagne a investi dans des paradis fiscaux », s’était amusé le numéro deux du FN dans un communiqué.

« Bref, la gauche morale, très en verve en France pour dénoncer la fuite des capitaux et brocarder les paradis fiscaux, semble être totalement imprégnée de l’esprit de la finance mondiale, celle-là même que pointait du doigt le président normal ! C’est en prenant connaissance de ces informations qu’on mesure la fracture qui existe entre la caste au pouvoir et le peuple. »

Louis Aliot oublie peut-être qu’en mai 1986, Jean-Marie Le Pen, fraîchement élu député à l’Assemblée nationale, avait jugé prioritaire de déposer au nom du Front national une proposition de loi d’« amnistie fiscale et douanière ».

« C’était une sorte d’avion renifleur »
Également questionné par Mediapart sur les sociétés offshore de son ancien trésorier, Jean-Marie Le Pen élude : « C’est son problème, pas le mien. » « Mouchard est mon ami, reconnaît-il, mais il n’est pas que ça, ce n'est pas une profession, “ami de Jean-Marie Le Pen”. C’était un homme d’affaires, président des éditions François Beauval. »

L’éditeur avait d’ailleurs contre toute attente acheté un brevet pétrolier avec Jean Garnier, ex-mari de l’actuelle femme de Le Pen, Jeanny Paschos… Le brevet Aquazole, qui protégeait une invention visant à ajouter une part d’eau dans le gazole, avait finalement été racheté pour 13 millions de francs en 1996 par le groupe Elf-Aquitaine, avant d’être abandonné faute d’efficacité. « Cela avait été cédé à Elf, mais ça n’a rien donné, explique aujourd’hui à Mediapart l’un des avocats de Garnier. C’était une sorte d’avion renifleur. » Une enquête avait été ouverte sur la plainte d’un des « inventeurs ». Classée sans suite, elle avait laissé ouverte l’hypothèse d’un financement politique du Front national par le groupe Elf.

« Je n’étais strictement pour rien dans cette affaire-là, moi, se plaint Jean-Marie Le Pen. C’était une affaire entre M. Garnier et M. Mouchard, qui ont vendu un brevet à une société quelconque. M. Garnier était son associé et le premier mari de ma femme. Ce sont des affaires qu’ils ont faites en association, tout à fait en dehors de moi. Il n’y a strictement aucun rapport entre cette affaire et Jean-Marie Le Pen et le Front national. »

La présidente du FN se plaint également du fait que son père « a été décortiqué jusqu’à la moelle ». « En 60 ans de vie politique, exclusivement dans l’opposition, il a eu 17 contrôles fiscaux, poursuit-elle. Vous savez combien de procédures Jean-Marie Le Pen a intentées? Il a dû en intenter 70 et il a dû obtenir 40 condamnations. J’en ai quatre tomes et ce n’est qu’une partie. » Comme avocate, Marine Le Pen s’est en effet elle-même chargée de plaider contre la presse certaines plaintes de son père.

C’est d’ailleurs l’un des arguments qu’ils opposent aux questions sur le patrimoine caché du fondateur du FN. Et à toutes les allusions aux déclarations de Pierrette Lalanne, l’ex-femme de Le Pen, sur le transfert des avoirs hérités du cimentier Hubert Lambert de l’UBS à la banque genevoise Darier et Cie – 17 millions de francs selon elle. « C’était les dires de Madame Le Pen. Mais elle a démenti tout cela depuis longtemps ! » assure l’ancien leader du FN. Par contre, le témoignage d’un ancien salarié d’une gérance de fortune de Genève, évoquant des dépôts en espèces de 15, 20, et 10 millions de francs, a fait l'objet d'une condamnation faute de preuves.

La banque suisse reste un sujet éminemment délicat pour les Le Pen. C’est peut-être ce qui explique, outre l’implication de Philippe Péninque dans l'affaire Cahuzac, leur retenue sur le sujet depuis trois mois. Lors des révélations de Mediapart, le 4 décembre, comme lors de l’ouverture de l’information judiciaire pour « blanchiment de fraude fiscale » et la démission du ministre, le 19 mars, le Front national n’a pas jugé bon de diffuser un seul communiqué, alors qu’il n’a jamais manqué de le faire sur les autres “affaires”: perquisitions au siège du PS du Pas-de-Calais, mise sous tutelle de la fédération PS des Bouches-du-Rhône, mise en examen de Sarkozy…

Le 19 mars, on dénombre douze communiqués, mais aucun sur Jérôme Cahuzac, qui vient pourtant de démissionner. Il faut d'ailleurs attendre le 2 avril, après les aveux de l’ex-ministre, pour que le FN fasse une déclaration officielle sur… « l’affaire d’État » qui atteint François Hollande et le gouvernement.

Questionnée dans les médias, la présidente du FN s’est montrée bien plus en retrait qu’à son habitude, martelant le principe de « présomption d’innocence », sans réclamer la démission de Cahuzac, mais simplement son changement de portefeuille ministériel, pour éviter tout « conflit d’intérêts ».

1. Er hat sich von der Ehefrau eines Geschäftsmannes ein Haus finanzieren lassen und dann über diesen Umstand das Parlament belogen!

2. Er hat einen Chefredakteur angerufen und Druck machen wollen.

3. Er hat ständig in den Häusern von reichen Leuten Urlaub gemacht, die von der Nähe zu einem Ministerpräsidenten Kapital schlagen können. 

Nummer zwei, die in dem Artikel explizit erwähnt wird, ist für sich genommen vielleicht gar nicht so schlimm, aber ein Grund für Journalisten auf den Wulff loszugehen. Vielleicht wird es deshalb erwähnt. Denn 1. und 3. sind vielleicht nicht strafrechtlich relevant, aber doch politisch so brisant, dass sie für sich genommen eigentlich schon als Rücktrittsgrund ausreichen.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I wouldn't go quite as far. Don't get me wrong, I never liked the guy, I found it incomprehensible and extremely frustrating to see him getting reelected again and again and again. His political style was disgusting and especially his behavior regarding his party's shadow accounts was criminal. How he conducted himself during the investigation and how he conveniently forgot things and put ""his word of honor"" over the law was extremely corrosive for the rule of law. I entirely agree that he should have, and I would have loved to see him, go to jail.

*However*, how he played his cards when the Wall fell was masterful. I have to give him that. Back then, I had thought he was mostly driven by narcissism and wanted to have his pages in the history books (actually, I still do), that he wanted to drive East Germans to the ballot boxes like cattle (if you recall, would have lost the vote back then had it only been conducted in the West), and I was convinced we should have taken our time with the Reunification. Like many, I had thought a driving factor was to get the daily migration figures out of the evening news. A lot of the problems we had/have in the East and in Germany as a whole have their roots in how it was done on this extremely tight schedule.  
But in retrospect, without the (DM) currency union and a quick reunification, the East -&gt; West migration would have turned into a flood that would have been devastating for both parts. It also quite possible that it would have become much more difficult from a geopolitical perspective after that window would have passed. Thatcher was openly opposed, and we now know that Mitterrand had severe doubts as well. His ""walks"" with Gorbachev and Mitterand were impressive diplomacy. Economically and socially, a reunification at a later date would have been difficult as well, and we might still have had many of the same issues.

Regarding the euro, yes, as we can plainly see by now, not insisting on a financial and political union proofed to be dangerously reckless. He [knew](http://www.ellopos.net/politics/mitterrand-kohl.htm) this was necessary, and he should have know that it wouldn't happen after the fait accompli. All over Europe, we're paying the price for that now, and that's certainly destructive.

Turkish retirees are actually super nice and helpful and way more laid back than their german counterparts. I`d rather live next to a turkish pensioner than next to a german pensioner.


The problems is actually their kids. The lower class 13-29 age group that has little education and little perspective in this country.

In a way this group did nothing different from their parents who were succesful, but all the manufacturing jobs where you needed little education that were plenty in the 50s are gone now. The expectations however were to at least do as well as their parents did
and the disappointment about the lack of succes let them often turn to defensive behaviour.

They became overly patriotic or religious or turned to drugs, violence or vandalism. They developed a chav-like culture that is very materilistic and laddish. 



Of course this is more of a socio economic problem and there are also plenty of turks who were able to move up the social ladder. But culturally turks have less affinity to education than eastern european, asian or iraninan immigrants, therefore the social mobillity is lower than in other immigrant groups. (not the lowest though, I think that would be  the italians)

The lower class turks give turks generally a bad rep which  makes it harder for those to find a job , who actually were able to achieve a higher level of education.

Zitat aus der Zeit: 

&gt;Nach den Bundesbank-Zahlen gehören den reichsten zehn Prozent der Haushalte hierzulande 59 Prozent der gesamten Vermögensmasse. Zu dieser Oberschicht zählt man ab einem Haushaltsvermögen von 440.000 Euro oder, wie andere Untersuchungen zeigen, einem Pro-Kopf-Vermögen von etwas mehr als 200.000 Euro. Viele Selbstständige überschreiten diese Grenzen und erscheinen als reich – auch wenn sie nur privat für das Alter vorsorgen. Umgekehrt wirken normale Angestellte und Beamte weniger wohlhabend, obwohl ihre Rentenansprüche viel Geld wert sind. Das Deutsche Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung hat einmal untersucht, wie viel es ausmacht, wenn man diese Ansprüche in die Vermögensrechnung einbezieht. Ergebnis: Die Ungleichheit sinkt massiv. Das oberste Zehntel verfügt nicht mehr über 15-mal so viel Besitz wie der Durchschnittsbürger, sondern nur noch über viermal so viel.

Im Übrigen stimme ich natürlich zu, dass es Ungleichheit in der Bevölkerung gibt. Vor allem zwischen Ost und West ist die Kluft immer noch sehr groß.

I'd it's still very much undetermined what the effects of the Euro are. Personally I think the EU and Eurozone has brought the people have Europe so much closer together than they were before. That sense of unity might be taking a *small* dip recently with the economic troubles, but *hey* it is a sovereign debt crisis, financial crisis, recession, physical currency crisis all rolled into one. I'd be surprised if there weren't some vocal groups around Europe talking about hoe Europe is crap, ect.

27 nations of Europe and counting (when does Croatia ascend?) are bound to together in a political and economic union. We have pan European pressure groups and pan European party alliances. We have pan European politicians. We can all, as Europeans, look at some of the same people and collectively agree that they're cunts. I can agree with Europeans on certain issues much more than I can with my fellow countrymen. 

The thing here, is that we're looking at the Eurocrisis from inside the Euroecrisis. If you look at it with historical perspective, all the visible anger between nations (both the people and the politicians) seems so much more superficial. So much more irrelevant. It's very easy to see how bad things are when when all you're doing is looking at them head on. If you look at them next to all the stuff that has come before, it doesn't look nearly as bad. It hardly looks bad at all and merely becomes a hiccup.

The EU will probably be around for a very long time, in a quite similar form to how it is today. The Euro currency is more uncertain, but if that fails it doesn't mean it's the end of anything, apart from that specific currency. All the Euro failing would mean, is that the Euro was a badly designed currency. The sense of friendship between Europeans will not be lost because one of the pan European projects failed. We have plenty of other successful ones like the European Convention on Human Rights, or the European Space Agency or CERN, or the common market.

Europeans today feel so close that they can *contemplate* having a unified foreign and defence policy. They're so close that politicians can bail out other European countries with billions to and not far from trillions of Euros in bailouts and still have a good shot at being re-elected. That takes a lot of closeness. 

I wouldn't worry about angst between different EU members. We'll be fine, and we'll probably continue to move closer together. The speed at which we move closer together is uncertain. I hope it's a slow but steady pace. But I don't think much could derail the project.",0,1365595627,null,0,false,0,c9c9bzk,t3_1c1s1e,t1_c9c9bzk,t1_c9c7rbu,null,1431608498,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Was aber auch daran liegt, dass Lehrer die sich aktiv um Kinder kümmern und sie nicht nur verwalten in der Minderheit sind. Das schlimme daran ist, dass es vollkommen verständlich ist. 

Wenn junge LehrerInnen in den Schulalltag eintreten sind sie oft optimistisch und wollen helfen wo es geht. Aber spätestens nach der fünften Runde (wenn deren Klasse die Schule abschließt und eine neue Klasse übernommen wird), sind viele Lehrer zu erschöpft oder haben einfach keine Lust mehr sich intensiv mit den Schülern zu beschäftigen. Meine Klassen waren immer mit 25 bis 35 Schülern gefüllt. Da ist einfach keine Zeit um sich um jedes Kind zu kümmern, besonders wenn diese LehrerInnen keinerlei Unterstützung seitens der Schule erhalten. Ich hatte in meinen drei Schulen die ich besucht habe nur einen Sozialarbeiter, den ich niemals zu gesicht bekommen habe, da er dies nur sekundär betrieb und primär ein einfacher Lehrer war der einige Stunden im einem Seminar verbracht hat und dabei auch noch für eine gesamte Mittel- und Oberstufe zuständig war. 

Dass manche LehrerInnen diesen Beruf wählen nur um ein sicherern Beamtenstatus zu erhalten und sich danach nurnoch durch den Schulaltag schleppen und ihren Lehrplan durcharbeiten, ist auch nicht ungewöhnlich. 

In meiner gesamten Schulzeit hatte ich lediglich eine Lehrerin die sich langfristig und aktiv für alle ihrer Schüler eingesetzt hat und dies war in der Oberstufe, wo die sozialen Probleme schon größtenteils keine Rolle mehr spielen, da die Schüler es meist garnicht bis dorthin geschafft haben.

Between '60-'74, a lot of 'shit went down' in Cyprus (explaining the details will be getting off-track, but I can elaborate if you/people are curious) leading to the turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.

After that, the balance (or whatever balance was left) between the two communities was lost. 

At the moment, even though our constitution established both communities, the society is not balanced at all, leaning towards the GC culture. This is due to many reasons, mostly because TC constitute around 2% of the population of the Republic of Cyprus (and 15% of the whole island).

Our education system is mostly Greek &amp; Orthodox based (with the exception of private english schools, which is where TC have to send their children). I don't know any GC who speak turkish and of course children are not taught anything about the TC culture or history. I've never met a TC, I've only seen them in the street. Some people even consider TC to be more or less Turks and thus they dislike/hate them. (Please don't take any offence by this, I don't support these opinions in any way)

In my opinion it is a very unfortunate situation because it only drives the two communities further away with no hope of joining again. I feel it is mostly unfair on the TC people, who, in a way, are not fully accepted by their own country.

If the two communities join again, I would like to see more integration of the two, starting with education. It is a bit too idealistic though, probably due to the GC community's unwillingness to mix with the TC one.

Just plastering a body kit on a clapped out Opel Astra or VW Golf is always frowned upon. I guess that would almost be the US equivalent of the white trailer trash redneck lifting and decorating his truck.

Putting bigger engines in lesser cars doesn't happen here much if at all.  
The whole concept of ""crate engines"" is non-existent and swapping -for example- a 3.0L BMW inline-6 in an originally 2.5L BMW car doesn't make much sense, neither in time nor money terms. So people who want more power usually turbo them. But even then it's a big €€€ outlay that often outweighs the potential gains. And then there's the insurance companies who won't pay out if the power is upped compared to what the car was built to handle originally.
Did I mention we have onerous VAT taxes on *everything* that makes shit freaking expensive? Costs very often make it not worth modifying anything for the casual car tweaker. You need to be dead-set on doing something no matter the cost.

Boulevard cruising almost doesn't exist here. So you earn no points for looks or sound. And even if there's something like that happening, most people will think you're a lout, an anti-social, a hooligan, trash, potential criminal etc.

In short: the ingrained European attitude simply doesn't compare, it's completely different to the US. Europe never went trough the post-WW2 love affair with the automobile like North America did. Plus cars are much more expensive to buy and considered luxuries and gasoline was always expensive and always took a big chunk out of the household budget so none could be spared for ""doing fun things with the already expensive car"".

On the other hand *pre-WW2* Europe had plenty of road racing and dirt road rallies and that's still somewhat visible in the all-round tastes regarding cars and roads. Light, fast cars and curvy roads vs. straight roads.

The Autobahn is fun the first 10 times. After that it gets boring real fast. Especially the frequent Stau (suddenly stopped car congestion in the middle of the road). Plus there's nothing to see along the road (on purpose I suspect, to keep distractions at speed to a minimum).

We could argue forever on who's to blame for causing the division, but that's never going to have a simple answer and would be entirely pointless so I'm not going there.

true,aslate,ENGL,England,"Rip it all apart was probably an overstatement, but I think it's been detrimental in the short and near terms to the EU.

I agree that the EU has brought Europe closer, but I think you may be overstating the Euro. As a Brit I don't know how much having a single currency has affected people on the ground with regards to more inter-EU travel and ease, but whether or not it's formed a much deeper connection?

We're inside the EU but outside the Eurozone (and affected by the crisis indirectly). Your point on historical context and the superficiality of it I think relates to the fact that the anger is directed at governments and not peoples. I imagine Greeks are annoyed at the Troika and Germany, but not Germans. That may be the important difference in how the conflicts are resolved. I don't expect wars or a dissolving of the EU, but I see less co-operation (unwillingness to compromise in treaties) in the near future because of it. I don't necessarily consider compromises currently being reached in the Eurozone crisis as co-operation, they're more agreements of circumstance.

Unlike CERN, ESA or the ECHR, this is an integration project not a co-operation project, therefore I see the failure here as being infinitely more significant. There is fallout that directly affects every individual in the Eurozone.

I think you're attributing a lot of cooperation with the establishment of the Euro, but I disagree. Yes, there are areas where there's more integration due to it, but I think you'll find that those areas are quite unstable, unlike those that are unrelated to the Euro. I think that it has just been the natural progression of the project, the people and the times we live in. The benefits of the EEC are becoming more and more important in the modern world.

Her only contact with outsiders was with the British during the colonial years but she never picked up a word of English. When she interacted with mainland Greeks, usually friends of her grandchildren or relatives of other villagers, she could communicate fine. She had some trouble mainly because of the fast-talking nature of colloquial modern Greek, and she had to form her sentences clearly and slowly for them to understand her, but the gap in communication was practically neglibible.

I don’t think the population is under any obligation to further risk their children by having a convicted rapist and paedophile walk free amongst their children. If any law mandates this then the law must be altered.

And in general there are a number of troublesome aspects of cases like this. Firstly when courts make rulings that are in direct opposition to large majorities of the population by whose consent they derive their only legitimacy, then they undermine their own respect – and ultimately legitimacy. Secondly, as is the case here, when the magistrates or institution is further removed from the population over which they exercise power and not under direct democratic control of the population over which they hold power then the population has become robbed of their rights as free men to exercise power over themselves according to their own wished.

Now, do you think the British population is in general agreement with the European court in Strasbourg on this issue that an expelled rapist and paedophile should have the rights to walk free among the population, and if not what, why should the population not throw off this remote institution which exercise power over them in opposition to their interests?",1,1365601178,null,0,false,0,c9cal00,t3_1c24x0,t1_c9cal00,t1_c9ca29q,null,1431607909,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

One reason for this may be that Germans have a very strong social safety net and they don't feel saving is a good use for money. 

In many other countries owning a home gives you peace of mind in the best of times and a money reservoir to tap into in the worst of times. Also homes are a way to accumulate and transfer wealth between generations. 

Not so in Germany where renting, not owning, is commonplace.

But I think the bigger question is, what do the Germans do with all that disposable income. We know they do not accumulate wealth. So where do the money go? Leisure? Luxuries?

The French for Africa and.. well, being French and so on, that's ignoring the countries that actually do 'really bad stuff' like Saudi, North Korea et al because they are criticised far more loudly and far more harshly again.

Is she? When you compare it to the criticism the US sees, or the UK, France and others? What about the 'criticisms' where they are very much justifiable like those aimed at Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea, Russia, China etc.. Israel has been in a conflict for a very long time now, there are a huge number of emotionally charged and very real issues that are worthy of criticism, it should not be surprising that such criticisms are raised. 

The complicating factor is that there is also anti-Semitism, and unlike aggressive attacks on other religious affiliations, whether its Islam, Catholicism or Atheism, attacks on Judaism have a single national target..  

There are also a lot of people who seem to try to be particularly sensitive to discussions and cannot see the other side at all:

&gt;As a case in point: you refer to Israel as a 'regime' as if it is led by some despot.

That may be the case, but it is a term that has been applied so liberally (especially to the governments of Blair, Bush and Obama by their detractors) that it is neither unreasonable nor excessive to see it used in the context of Israel.  

Personally I think the criticism of the criticism gets in the way of anyone being able to have a valid discussion and that the current way this is talked about is really unhelpful and actually makes it easier for people with anti-Semitic positions..",0,1365603857,null,0,false,0,c9cbdr6,t3_1c21ql,t1_c9cbdr6,t1_c9c9spb,null,1431607532,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

As for Cypriots specifically, it's usually not very distinct from the perception of Greeks in general, but the ""no"" from the south in the referendum didn't help much (though I understand that you guys had your reasons for it).

It is always advisable to try whatever is local and seasonal to the region when you're visiting, most of these dishes will be a source of great local pride and as such will be fresher and tastier than almost anything else on the menu.

Bakeries are a true German delight (as long as you like your treats savoury) and you'll find them almost around every corner in German towns and cities.

Most of their policies could be pretty popular amongst both left and right, but after their recent bi-election victory, many of these policies are likely to be adopted by the main parties.  Also, the party leadership are all pretty bizarre individuals.

In all honesty, details OP! It´s all about details.
You´re coming to Germany, we Germans, plan stuff and act accordingly.
So the better you are prepared the better your reception will be and your experience. But that applies to every holiday (my experience)

If you just want to crash at a place and drift around that´s cool.
Each larger City (&lt;100 000 inhabitants) has decent Hostels/Hotels &amp; Bridges, so sleeping is sound.

Public transportation is very good and other than /u/tomdwilliams stated it is reliable, but not just all the time. It is not cheap, but still way cheaper than public transportation in the UK.
I´d suggest that you get a weekpass or a touristticket, every city will have such an offer in stock.

Other than that, we Germans can be fun, we even can handle humor.

Btw there aren´t that many restaurants that offer Currywurst, but allmost all of them offer propper meat dishes, fish dishes (GO TO HAMBURG for propper fish!) and vegetarian dishes.

Beer, you can expect loads of beer!
Drink it!

If you are visiting a local bar/pub/coffee shop or other places you do not have to pay for the use of the restroom. Each place that hands out drinks is required by law to have restrooms to be used for free by it´s customers.

Oh yeah, there is the law in Germany, don´t fuck with it! But do not be afraid, our coppers are generally helpfull, but be aware there is a slight difference, some ppl appear to be police officers but are just local parking enforcers, those are utter cunts! Don´t tell them, they´ll fine the living daylight out of you.

Fun: There is loads to have in Germany, most pubs and bars are open till 1-2 am on a normal weekday and weekends you shouldn´t have a problem to get reasonably drunk!

Parks and Museums are to found in allmost every city, but for Museums 
I´d either suggest Berlin or Cologne, Hamburg is a beautiful city as well.
They tend to be a little rough on the outside but once they notice that you´re a forigner on holidays they´ll soften up.

Berlin and Cologne are really colourfull.

Zionism is the justification for why it is deserved, in Israel, based on religion and history. I suppose that I would argue that the secular historic right idea is based on a secular rationalization of the religious importance, so that is why I phrased it as such.

Football and FCN (""Der Club""): You can buy at a online shop like eventim or maybe in the [bvd Kartenservice in the Lange straße 22](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=lange+stra%C3%9Fe+22,+bamberg&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;hnear=Lange+Stra%C3%9Fe+22,+96047+Bamberg,+Oberfranken,+Bayern&amp;gl=de&amp;t=m&amp;z=14). 

Here are my standard tourist recommendations for the whole region:

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*[Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!
*In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.
*[Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.
*[Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 
*[Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing
*In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!
*Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

**Bamberg:**
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.
* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)
* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above
* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.bamberg-guide.de/bamberg/bierundbierkultur/kellerbilder/titelfoto-bearbeitet.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.
* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.
*Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recomment ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**
*[Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here
*[Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)
*Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see
*Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live, and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car.
*[Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremburg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle there and live there.
*[Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.
*The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.
*At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.


Traditional Food you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;That inflation prediction has been waiting to come for a long time now. It will probably never come (...)

Wrong. Whenever you expand the money supply more than the gdp grows, there's inflation and the prices rise. This however only happens on the medium and long run, not on the short term, so yeah, while the Americans keep on spending and are paying that with new dollar bills and while we're here actually cutting the spending, yeah, they might be better as of now, but in any longer period of time, say 5 to 10 years, we'll then be growing and our purchasing power increasing whereas they'll see their prices rising far more than their actual income, by then they'll be the ones losing purchasing power.

&gt;Americans have a lot of debt to pay and they can just use the money to do just that instead of buying stuff. Which is exactly what they are doing right now.

Unless the root problem is fixed - in this case, excessive public spending - no medicine will be able to solve things. You can address the disease and cut spending - like the EU is doing - or you can address the symptoms and just print money - like the USA is doing.

Regardless of how you deal with the debt, public spending is always done at the expense of the population and will have to be paid one way or the other, either the population loses purchasing power through taxes or through inflation. 

&gt;Americans mostly have their savings invested so they have nothing to fear from inflation.

Nothing to fear from inflation? When their prices start some 6% or 8% a year, we'll see how they'll feel about it.

&gt;A little bit of inflation, even 4-5% is no demon and no problem. 

It all depends on how much money they print and how much their economy actually grows. Considering their recent talk of just printing it all away and their constant increases of the debt limit, we'll see how long they'll be able to hold till they start resorting to inflation/taxes to pay their debt and austerity measures to cut their deficits.

&gt;If anything the American private sector is deleveraging much better than the European one.

Just like someone who's very thirsty and drinks seawater is temporarily better than someone who didn't do that and is waiting for freshwater to quench the thirst. I know I should talk in analogies but you have to understand that they're not getting a free lunch through government action, that they're just delaying their problems while making them worse as their debt continues to rise.

&gt;Like you say it's the private sector that matters to grow an economy.

It is, and for it to prosper on the long run, it needs low taxation and stable prices. The Americans have both for now while the Europeans have high taxation, but you can't just look at the short term, on a longer period of time, the European will see tax cuts because there won't be a need to pay down public debt and the prices will remain stable because they weren't expand the money supply to pay for their debt whereas the American will either see tax rises or a loss of price stability to pay for their ever increasing debt. By then, things will start improving here whereas they'll start failing there and they'll have to go through what we're currently going through in harsher conditions because of how long it took them to start actually solving their debt problem.

&gt;By contrast the European private sector is not being able to deleverage because they have to deal with deflation and unemployment. 

First of all, there's no deflation here, our inflation remains quite stable at 2%. Theirs is close to ours though they've had some fluctuations between 2% and 4%. Anyway, no deflation here and no inflation like the ones they'll start getting in a few years if they continue to expand their money supply.

As for unemployment, yeah, unemployment is substantially higher here though they'll have to go through the same once they start paying down their debt with taxes. Or the can inflate and keep their employment though it will be futile as they'll lose their purchasing to inflation anyway.

&gt;When the upturn comes it is the European economy that will not be able to grow because of its private sector and public sector debt.

There's no such as random downturns and upturns, they're caused by what's going in the economy. Without restrictions, the private sector adapts quite fast and it won't be a problem, as for the public sector debt, it's being paid and eventually will stop being a problem.

&gt;While the American private sector will be able to make America grow and, by doing so, fix their public sector problem.

Just like the Portuguese spending made Portugal grow and that fixed our public sector problem? Yeah, keep dreaming.

Spending to fix the spending problem is beyond retarded, Keynes must be rolling in his grave seeing that people want to use their cure for massive deflation to solve the problems of too much public spending.",0,1365620257,null,0,false,0,c9chi30,t3_1bxnbg,t1_c9chi30,t1_c9bzeg8,null,1431604577,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

* Nell'intanto, buttare la pasta e tirarla su parecchio al dente

* Prendere una cucchiaiata di sugo, sbatterla nella teglia, spararci sopra una cucchiaiata di besciamella e fare il fondo

* Fare scamorza e Galbanino a dadi

* Schiaffare nella teglia pasta, sugo, dadi di formaggio, quasi tutto il grattugiato e quasi tutta la besciamella. Amalgamare

I think it boils down to this: No matter what we do, the Euro crisis is going to cost the German (and Finish and Dutch and..) taxpayer huge sums of money. Be it a Marshal plan, Eurobonds, a Euro breakup or just permanent wealth transfers to ""the South"", somebody has to pay it. At this point, I think it is unavoidable and only a matter of time (maybe after the elections in September?). The question is: How do we avoid this from happening again? While the (German) public might be (extremely grudgingly) willing to shoulder the burden once, it will demand guarantees that this will not happen again (and rightly so, I think). Or to put it another way: While at this point, it may not be important why some countries need help, if there are excesses again (there have been some. I am not saying everybody ""south"" is evil and lazy and whatnot.), the proverbial is gonna hit the cooling device. 

Actually, I thought about Soros alot today (when I should have been working). I just read a news article, so I was pleasantly surprised when I read (most of) his speech. I especially like his 60% cutoff idea. That might help towards the above mentioned guarantee. Still, to sell something like this will be a herculean task.

Some of the (legal) differences between our countries are:

- Prostitution is legal [wouldn't interest me, but I don't know what interests you]

- Carrying alcoholic beverages with you is legal, but walking around shitfaced might get you in a little bit of trouble, although that is unlikely. You should be more afraid of whatever you might do while under influence.

- Being stoned isn't illegal, selling weed is however, as is carrying more than a certain amount of it.

- Age of consent is 18 here as well.


Generally speaking, I can't think of anything important that is illegal here which would be allowed in the US (except for stricter gun laws), if you have basic common sense, you should be golden. We are pretty laid back people here. Just don't fuck around with the police too much, they can detain you for 24 hours (I think it was that much) without charges.


Also, people here might be a little more direct and open, to the point of appearing rude. Try not to be alarmed by that, it might feel a little strange or hostile, if you are not used to it.

The Sharia is pure evil.

The only fact that you say that you say that stupid shit proves that Islam is still as evil and gives violent ideas of domination over other religions.

Plus I don't know where you're from and if you're not aware of the Balkan history that's ok but don't talk bullshit. Fist of all the people of the first Bulgarian kingdom(before the fall under Byzantine) were two types-the Slavs who were the majority in the country and the proto-Bulgarians who were a minority but ruled. Slavs believed in their God-Perun and proto-Bulgarians-in Tangra. King Boris Mihail 1 decided that he had to unite these people under one religion and make them one nation(as we are today) so he made Christianity the official religion-in order to unite the two nations as one and he did that. He achieved that with some evil actions but he did it. Also that's when the Cyrillic alphabet was created. Another thing to unite the nation-our alphabet. Today Russians, Ukranians, Serbs and others have come up with their version of the alphabet. Bulgarian language started to be used in churches rather than Greek and Latin. Christianity is the creation of the Bulgarian nation uniting Slavs and Bulgarians. Today We could say that Bulgarians are vastly Slavs(except for the Turks and gypsies). 

Another thing-much like the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire did not change the religion of the conquered nations. That wasn't their politic.

And if Islam is the one ""True Religion"" how come only 1% of the population accepted it just because they feared losing their heads? You know try searching for massacres on the Balkans done by the Ottoman Empire and then you'll understand why some people had to choose Islam.

On the topic of lack of humility:

On the same program  there was a member of the Pirate Party, and it was just so fascinating to me to see how her iconoclastic attitude and assertions were fielded by the other panelists, and how the audience's faces reacted to her, in particular. How iconoclasts are treated by the society they are criticizing is a really fascinating thing that I study carefully when I see it.

This woman was very humble and gentle-spirited (in a somewhat ungerman way), but you could see on her face as she was silent all through the conversation (which was primarily about the miniseries: ""Unsere Mütter, unsere Väter"") how she was so critical of the manner in which the topic was being discussed - especially by the elderly gentleman who had grown up as a boy during the Nazi era.

When she finally spoke, she was instantly the center of attention, because she was voicing a fundamental challenge to the style in which German people think and talk about matters from day to day. What I saw was that she was treated with visible affection by the host and by the other panelists after her lineup of criticisms of the society. You would never see an iconoclast treated that way in the USA or the UK; here in the USA, people take great offense when folks challenge their cultural sensibilities.

Yet, I ended up being so intrigued by the difference between the humility and gentleness of this young Pirate Party lady, and the lack of humility in the ordinary forthright banter of the other German panelists. That's one thing I would really miss if I moved back to Germany - humility (For this reason, I'm studiously learning Japanese as well as brushing up on my German vocabulary with the intention of keeping the door open to the possibility of carving myself out a niche in Japan, halfway around the world - where humility is a highly valued personality trait).

It's not as bad as it's portrayed on reddit, most of the Roma I've met aren't going to rob you or anything.

It's just that 20% of them operate like a mafia, and another 70% are people that you couldn't hang with or something, aside from buying stuff from them etc. if for some reason you were to insist befriending them or sth at some point it will end up in some kind of fight, they don't consider ""outsiders"" to be normal. And you are not likely to find a 16 year old smoking a joint in front of his family of 3 kids normal either. 

Where I live there are 2 groups and they are kind of seperate. The semi integrated group, and the ones from the ghetto (which aside from the guns is probably worse than an american ghetto). They are seperate as in if someone from the first group mentions knowing someone from ""dendropotamos"" then everyone else will be like ""you really are that badass?""

That place has like 2 policemen for 10 000 people, the entire area around it has been carefully blocked, and if you go there you'll be seeing like heroine addicts passed out in the middle of the steeet while kids play soccer next to them and then some truck has to pass and they get out and kick him away. 

In my city they basically don't have enough money to deal with the heroin addicts etc. so they purposedly sent all the trade to take place at the gypsy ghetto, and the mafia there who wouldn't let normalized society enter anyway, found the whole thing profitable.

The GD is actually scared of the Roma cause many of the Roma don't legally exist, they could shoot someone and then move out the country or hire some gangster etc. which is why the Golden Dawn only targeted Pakistani and Nigerians who aren't that connected.

So to answer your initial question, why isn't something done about the ghetto? Cause the police couldn't handle the drug trade if it took place downtown, and the foreign druglords with the roma mafia are profiting from it and possibly bribing the police etc.",0,1365629115,null,0,1365629714,0,c9cl2i5,t3_1c1xjr,t1_c9cl2i5,t1_c9cetjw,null,1431602896,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

I actually wouldn't really have a problem with the gypsies if they'd be honest, I would even employ them, but those are rare and the prejudice (which is not unfounded) makes it harder for these honest ones to get any decent job. I do believe that with effort they could catch up with others, maybe not in a generation, but two-three and the public opinion on them would definitely change over time as well.

But the Romanian has to change as well if we in turn want to catch to Western societies. The mentality on work is really a negative one in Romanians in general imo. 

I never hear anyone say a good thing ever about their jobs, it's always complaints (prick boss, prick co-workers, prick customers, shit pay, shit job) or they refuse to go to work even for 1200 lei god forbid it would pay 850 lei (that's how much my salary is) because they aren't going to work for that kind of money, instead they'll sit home dreaming of the €500-€1000 job they don't have. Also most from the younger generation (read in their 20s) pretty much wants to end up in a high position from the get go, but that's not how it works. You have to start somewhere and build up from there if you will be working for someone. The final thing I noticed is that they aren't even motivated to work if they have a job, they simply don't realise that if the firm is doing good, that means they'll have a secure job, they can have bonuses or a raise etc. Instead they often times do a shitty job because the idea is that the boss is only leeching on them and using them, a heartless bastard.

se non ho voglia di cucinare, la roba più veloce del mondo è il petto di pollo in tocchetti cotto nella birra. ne sa. appacchi.

se voglio un primo, di solito mi faccio una pasta col tonno: prepari un trito di cipolla finissima (ma anche a meno) su cui butti il tonno scolato e aggiungi un dado knorr. quando ha preso il suo bel colorino maròn da dado, aggiungi la pasta scolata e la fai saltare in padella due-tre-cinque minuti. aggiungere prezzemolo.

se voglio un primo ed è estate, ti fai una pasta corta (penne rigate uber alles) e la lasci freddare (volendo anche sotto l'acqua fredda, perchè IDGAF), aggiungi pomodorini tagliati a spicchi, feta, origano ed olio. Divina. Se ne fai tanta la puoi tenere in frigo, tanto è una pasta fredda.

se sei uno che prepara le cose in anticipo, le porpettazze di riso alla giapponese con dentro un ""condimento"" a scelta.
Oppure ti fai una bella pasta in quantità garguantesche e quello che avanza lo sbatti in forno con chili di formaggia e lo trasformi in un pasticcio.

Se vuoi mangiare qualcosa di fast davanti alla tv mentre guardi Mistero o un film, caprino + olio + sale + pepe, ben mescolato, da accompagnarsi con pringles. Seriamente, cibo degli dei. Due fetti di salame milano ci stanno bene MA l'equazione è caprino + pringles. se vuoi fare il figo spalmi il carpino tra due pringles. vero eroe.

Se ti va un pollo un pò più leggero del pollo fritto, prendi il pollo e lo ammolli nel latte per 30/60 min. lo impani poi direttamente in un misto di pane e formaggio duro (da grattare, tipo parmigiano o pecorino). Dopodichè, forno per tipo 10/15 minuti sui 180. meglio se fai bocconcini.

Se sei uno da salse, per pinzimonio o che altro, pupi provare a mixare senape e salsa di soia. sembra una lordura ma ha un sapore che non so. devo provare a fare le sovracosce al forno spennellate con sta salsa che imho ne sa appacchi.

della piadina ne abbiam parlato già in altri thread, comunque di base è un mix farina acqua sale lievito in proporzioni 2/1 tra farina e acqua (ma anche ad occhio, quando crei una pallotta che non ti si appiccica alle mani ma è elastica hai fatto centro). Puoi stenderla per farne una piadina, oppure farne pallette per creare bocconcini adatti allo spiluccamento con salumi e minutaglie varie davanti alla tv (tipo tigelle, ma non tigelle).

Oppure puoi dichiararti re della cucina e friggere. Vitello pucciato in farina, uovo, pane, uovo, pane, fritto: cotoletta alla milanese (ci vorrebbe l'osso, ma sticazzi). Alla fine ti avanza farina, pane e uovo? mischia tutto assieme, crea un cilindro di questo panfaruovo, taglialo a fette e friggilo. Come un capo. Stesso procedimento per friggere altri tipi di carne.

&gt;10 April 2013 – The Netherlands, along with four Nordic countries – Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden – top a United Nations list released today, which ranks children’s well-being in 29 industrialized countries, while Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are at the bottom.

[This is the ranking table](http://i.imgur.com/WDg1xBO.png). I'm not sure exactly what to think of the abstract above really... Portugal, for example, is higher than the UK, Canada and Austria, all of the Southern European countries mentioned are higher than the bottom third, Greece is above the US, Italy still has more countries behind... I'm not sure exactly what to make of the headline to be honest... it seems that someone had already the countries lined up and just said ""fuck the data, who cares about that, we all know they suck anyway, we'll just define the bottom are anything after the last Nordic country and then select the ones we want"".

Can anyone shed some insight into this? I find it so absolutely shitty that I'm certain I'm missing something here.

__________________

1. ""We do not want a united Germany,"" Thatcher told Soviet leader Gorbachev just two months before the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989.

2. ""Germany has veered between aggression and self-doubt. The true origin of German angst is the agony of self-knowledge.""

3. ""By its very nature, Germany is a destabilising, rather than a stabilising, force in Europe,"" Thatcher wrote in her autobiography in 1993.

4. ""What you Germans are doing is not good for Europe,"" Thatcher told Die Zeit publisher Josef Joffe in 1996.

5. According to the memoirs of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Thatcher said prior to German reunification: ""We beat the Germans twice, and now they're back!""

6. ""Of course I did not want East Germans to live under Communism, but it seemed to me that a truly democratic East Germany would soon emerge and the question of reunification was a separate one, on which the wishes and interests of Germany's neighbours and other powers must be fully taken into account.""

7. ""That man is so German,"" Thatcher said, referring to former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

8. ""Kohl is capable of anything. He has become a different man. He does not know who he is anymore. He sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it,"" Thatcher said according to a French diplomatic memo.

9. ""If there is one instance in which a foreign policy I pursued met with unambiguous failure, it was my policy on German reunification,"" she later admitted.

10. ""These events marked the most welcome political change of my lifetime,"" she wrote of the fall of the Berlin Wall. ""But no matter how much I rejoiced at the overthrow of Communism in eastern and central Europe, I was not going to allow euphoria to extinguish either reason or prudence.""",0,1365631745,null,0,false,0,c9cm27q,t3_1c1zmu,t1_c9cm27q,t3_1c1zmu,null,1431602359,8,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,8

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;That's not a new idea. The Wikipedia article on the EU debt crisis links this and this and some more (sources start at around 400).

I know. Thank you for the articles. However, I do not understand why the authors thinks Germany will be the only country who leaves, if it does. Once Germany leaves, I am having a hard time seeing Finland stay, or the Netherlands. Then the Euro will soon consists of GIIPS countries, not really that great of an idea...

One important thing however that I think he glosses over is the lack of competiveness in the GIIPS countries, how it has sunk, drastically. And, how it is not going to get better unless they get massive transfers. The Eurobonds is not going to solve that. And, that it takes decades for the competitive industry to be built. So, Eurobonds and permanent transfers for the next 25 years - no one will vote for that, ever. 

&gt;EU debt crisis

Eurozone :-).

&gt;At this point, I think it is unavoidable and only a matter of time (maybe after the elections in September?). 

What is unavoidable? The break up? 

&gt;How do we avoid this from happening again?

Well, at first one has to re-write the Maastrich treaty (not that it is going to happen). One of the big reasons for the current situation is that we have a currency union, but not a banking union, nor do we have transfers to ""even out"" the differences. It is Economics 101 that it will not work, unfortunately. I look at the treaty and really wonder - how could they have been so stupid - all of them.

However - the Maastricht treaty will not get re-done, since the north would and will vote no, no and no again. So, they have to break up I guess.


&gt;While at this point, it may not be important why some countries need help, if there are excesses again (there have been some. I am not saying everybody ""south"" is evil and lazy and whatnot.), the proverbial is gonna hit the cooling device.

I think the shit is hitting the fan :-), I am just wondering which country will be the first. I used to think Greece, Portugal, but now I am more leaning towards a norther country abandoning the Euro. And then it will be catastrophic. However, I see it as a boil than needs to be lanced, better sooner than later, it is not getting easier. 

&gt; especially like his 60% cutoff idea. That might help towards the above mentioned guarantee. 

I don't believe in it, and if I do not, you can bet that a lot of other people don't, so you are right, it is a Herculean task selling it. After reading your answer, I sat and tried to think what would convince me to a) believe in the Euro b) be willing to transfer huge amount south and pay off other countries debt (I know, we are not in the EZ, thought experiment). Unfortunately,nothing really could convince me. However it flies, even if they were to remake the Maastrich treaty, I am still convinced just more of my money will end up south. That is the problem, no matter how he sells it, that is the result, and it can't be overlooked. Personally, I am also extremely against it because of the rulebreaking that is not stopping - nothing lasting can be built upon treating treaties like toilet paper, and the enormous democratic deficit. 



Personally I think it was best if the GIIPS countries quit and quickly became competitive again - I hope that will happen, they are most certainly not in a fun place...However, Germany leaving will certainly be interesting. 

&gt;He also correctly remarks that Germany did not want to be a ""leader"".

True, honestly, France is not even attempting to do anything at the moment, they are paralysed. I completely agree with Soros there - one way or another they have to act, and the choice, is of course, theirs. 

&gt;The Hitler mustaches around the ""south"" tell you exactly why. 

Yes, it is rather unfair, but they are not really in a happy place right now..

Relative poverty/ the GINI coefficient and other measures of wealth inequality in countries are actually very important.

The brown/ occa colourscheme work very well in the context and underline the rich oak idea. The hillsides dominating the artwork underline the ""valley of the deer"" aspect Glenfiddich always promotes in its PR to seem less like a global mega company. The fact that they didn't use the big golden deer in the design also makes the packaging look less tacky and more mature. Colour and texture of the drink itself are just as pleasing to the eye.

Germans are definitely one of the more direct cultures. While the contrast to the U.S. and even Canada is not are not as extreme as to some latin american or arabic countries, it can still be quite noticeable.

Some other factoids I find quirky about live in germany:

- Excessive annoyance over small delays. If the conductor announces that the train will arrive 5 minutes late to the next stop, people start muttering under their breath. - Meanwhile in Costa Rica I was told, that the Bus would stop by sometime between 3:30 and 5:30.
- At german universities lecture are either c.t. (cum tempore) or s.t. (sin tempore). c.t. means that the lecture will start late, but late by an exact amount, usually 15 minutes. If you arrive 16 minutes late you will get a stern look.
- I think it is a bit of a rite of passage to get chewed out on your first job. Nothing major, but you will most likely screw up at some point and get a rather rough talking to.

Il punto è che Gta è il nuovo Marylin Manson, e come era cretino dire che Columbine era colpa di Marylin Manson così è cretino dire che questa storia è colpa di Gta. Sarei curioso di sapere quanta gente della generazione immediatamente precedente alla mia che ai tempi era scettica su Marylin Manson oggi è genuinamente spaventata da Gta",0,1365636639,null,0,false,0,c9cntk4,t3_1c2v17,t1_c9cntk4,t1_c9cl1xk,null,1431601530,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

You need the pronom ""se"" here.

That's because the verb ""llevar"" as referring someone's name, doesn't exist without pronom.


&gt;Yo ando de bicicleta

It's ""en"" no ""de"". And probably you want to use the verb ir instead andar (that literally means walking)

&gt;Yo voy en bicicleta

You will see a lot of spanish speakers misusing ""on, in, at"" because in spanish it's the same word for everything. ""en"".

Negative goes first:

**1)** Free a un **énorme** retard sur le FTTH et n'a apparemment aucune intention d'investir d'avantage dans ce domaine. La fibre avec Free n'est disponible que dans très peu de ville en France et même dans ces villes, seule une infime minorité y a accès (même à Paris à quelques mètres d'un NRO Free, très rares sont les immeubles éligibles). Vous faites donc parti de rares chanceux y ayant accès. 
De plus, on peut trouver de partout sur les forums spécialisés de très nombreux témoignages sur des syndics ayant signé des conventions avec Free Infrastructure pour que Free soit l'opérateur d'immeuble (qui est censé fibrer verticalement l'immeuble) et où rien ne se passe même des années après (souvent convention signée en 2010 et toujours rien en 2013). Ces gens se retrouvent donc sans accès à la fibre alors que tout le quartier et les immeubles voisins sont fibrés par d'autres opérateurs. Pendant ce temps, Orange investi énormément dans pleins de villes en France et est l'opérateur d'immeuble principal dans la très grande majorité des cas, ce qui n'est pas forcément une bonne chose car ça motive les autres FAI à profiter de la mutualisation pour ne pas investir dans leur propre réseau et on se retrouve donc avec un monopole de l'opérateur historique comme pour le cuivre. J'ai personnellement Orange en FTTH car c'est le seul FAI dispo dans mon immeuble, comme c'est le cas pour la majorité des gens, surtout en province.


**2)** C'est bien beau d'avoir 150 Mb/s mais avoir une politique de peering complètement pourrie ça n'a aucun intérêt (par exemple Youtube complètement inutilisable aux heures de pointe même en 360p et ce, même avec la fibre). Xavier Niel se fout de nôtre gueule en affirmant qu'il faudrait augmenter les forfait de 10 ou 15€ pour qu'ils puissent upgrade leur réseau et qu'on puisse avoir des débits sur Youtube corrects alors que l'ARCEP a déterminé que seuls quelques centimes suffiraient. Free cherche juste à dépenser le moins possible dans leur réseau national et dans le FTTH pour investir dans le réseau mobile à la place.


**3)** Avez-vous une Freebox v6 ou v5 ? La Freebox v5 optique est limté à ~30 Mbp/s, ce qui oblige les utilisateurs à prendre la Freebox v6 pour profiter d'un bon débit fibre, qui est facturé 6€ de plus par mois. Et oui, c'est finit le ""29,99€ par mois, c'est tout compris !""

Je tiens à préciser que je ne suis pas anti-Free, d'ailleurs j'ai été chez Free pendant 7 ans et mes parents sont toujours chez eux en ADSL (c'est aussi les seuls qui ont dégroupé le NRA) et pendant des années, c'est vrai qu'ils ont fait de très bonnes choses, c'est eux qui ont fait baissé le prix de l'ADSL, la Freebox v6 est un très bon produit et très en avance par rapport aux autres (pour moi la meilleure box du marchée, bien qu'elle ait plus de 2 ans).

Tout ça pour dire que Free sont loin d'être des saints et que cette réputation (surtout chez les geeks) du gentil opérateur révolutionnaire qui va nous sauver des méchants Orange et SFR n'a plus du tout lieu d'être à ce jour.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"&gt;  The ESM document, obtained by Reuters, bears the date of April 23, 2013, indicating that this will be the date when the euro zone is likely to formally sign the bailout agreement with Cyprus.

The date looks rather interesting considering the auditor general announced a couple of days ago that Cyprus will run out of money on exactly.... April 24 :P

&gt; The assessment, obtained by Reuters on Wednesday, also said that Cyprus would raise 10.6 billion euros from the winding down of Laiki Bank and the losses imposed on junior bondholders and the deposit-for-equity swap for uninsured deposits in the Bank of Cyprus.

Remember how that used to be a 5.2 billion figure? :D

Total size of the bailout is now ~€23 billion from the 15-17 billion it used to be.

This isn't a Kosovo situation where Albanians made up a majority in a geographically contained area.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"For anybody that hits the paywall

&gt; At Friday’s gathering of eurozone finance ministers in Dublin, the so-called eurogroup is expected to give a “political endorsement” of the details of Cyprus’ €10bn bailout programme, according to a senior EU official.

&gt; Ahead of that meeting, documents related to that sign-off have begun to leak out, including the always-interesting “debt sustainability analysis” (which Brussels Blog got its hands on [and posted here](http://blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk/brusselsblog/files/2013/04/DSA-9-April2013.pdf)) and an equally intriguing document titled “assessment of the actual or potential financing needs of Cyprus”, which we’ve also [posted here](http://blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk/brusselsblog/files/2013/04/Estimate-of-financing-needs-ESMT-art-13-v09042013-1.pdf).

&gt; As our friends and rivals at Reuters first reported, the most unexpected thing in the documents is the revelation that Nicosia will help reduce its debt burden by selling off “the excess amount” of gold reserves held by the Cypriot central bank, which is expected to raise €400m.

&gt; But the details of the rest of what will be the “contribution by Cyprus” to the bailout may be more significant. It is spelled out in detail on page four of the second document and makes clear just how damaging the mishandling of the first bailout agreement was.

&gt; Originally, Cyprus was to contribute €7bn (€5.8bn from the now-infamous bank levy and the rest from a new withholding tax on investment profits) to the €17bn total cost of the bailout. Just over a week later, the amount Nicosia will contribute almost doubled, to €13bn, and the total price tag had increased to €23bn.

&gt; The amount sucked out of Cyprus’ two largest banks, largely through imposing massive losses on deposits over €100,000, will be €10.6bn, the document estimates. In other words, the cost to bank account holders to bail out Cyprus’ financial sector increased by nearly €5bn in nine days. That’s almost a third of the island’s entire economy.

&gt; For those who really like to dig into the details, there’s one other intriguing section to look at in the second document. Right up front on the first page, it makes clear that one of the ways Cyprus is expected to reduce the cost of the bailout is through a voluntary roll-over of €1bn in domestic-law bonds.

&gt; To de-jargon that a bit, of the €1.7bn in Cypriot bonds in private hands that come due during the three-year programme and were written under Cypriot law, bailout lenders are only giving Cyprus €700m to pay their owners back. What about the rest? “Cypriot authorities will encourage domestic investors (banks, insurance companies and state-owned interprises) to roll over” those holdings – in other words, getting them to accept new, long-term bonds in their place.

&gt; This may seem overly technical, but when a similar “voluntary” rollover of bonds issued under Greek law was proposed two years ago for Athens, credit rating agencies said it would likely be considered a “selective default”, since owners were really being coerced to take something other than full repayment.

&gt; This may be significant because eurozone leaders have vowed Greece would be the eurozone’s only sovereign default. Could the agencies decide the “voluntary” rollover of Cypriot bonds is equivalent to a “selective default”? It’s something worth watching.",0,1365648940,null,0,false,0,c9csbsg,t3_1c3ziq,t1_c9csbsg,t3_1c3ziq,null,1431599406,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Lithuanian language is very phonetic (one letter almost always stands for one sound) so when you know what is pronounced in what way, you know how it will always be pronounced.
Here are the pronunciations of unusual letters.

Š is pronounced like in Sh english
Į is basicly a long I (like ee in sheep) 
Ū is pronounced like long u (oo in moor)
Ų Same as Ū only due to grammatical appears in the end of words.
Ė - hard to explain, something like ae, cant find a propper english equivalent. But in the song it is last sound in the word virė.
Ą, same as Į, longer, deeper A (the middle sound in car vs. cup)
Ę - longer deeper e 
Ž - same as g in mirage

&gt;""Bathing"" (with a long A) means cleansing yourself in water. It never means swimming

In en-GB the non-transitive form means swimming and the transitive or reflexive form means washing.

In RP both are pronunciations are long As, but in Melbourne the transitive form is pronounced with a short A - they shorten a lot of vowels.

In en-AU neither form is particularly common, but derivatives like bathers for (especially men's) swimwear are. 

&gt;Not to be too offensive, but I'm guessing you don't live in the country that owns/runs the world. 

I live in a former colony of one which did once own a pretty good chunk of the world, and was born in said former world-owning country.

&gt;And I should point out, just being a US citizen doesn't make one ""correct"" in their opinions.

This is probably a difference between en-US and en-GB, but I've no idea what, say, Scots does, so I can't say which of us is using ""off-brand English"".  However, Tolkien used it that way, and as he was a professor of linguistics I think I'm probably justified in doing so.

E' un piatto che richiede un po' di preparazione...ricordo era una delle ricette della Parodi -inb4 shitstormlaparodinonsacucinarewharfgarbl- e diamine se è buono!

Mia madre usa lo spinaccino con tasca (lo troviamo all'esselunga abbastanza facilmente). Togli la pelle ai würstel e farcisci lo spinaccino. Chiudi il tutto con degli stuzzicadenti. Mettilo a cuocere e aggiungi la senape in grani (purtroppo sulla cottura non ti so aiutare, ma credo si faccia come un arrosto normale, aggiungendo un po' d'acqua ogni tanto che fa il sughetto sul fondo). Quando la carne è cotta togli gli stuzzicadenti, affettala (consiglio fette sottili o non dura un quarzo), disponila su un piatto. Versa il sughetto sulle fette (credimi, è la parte più buona) e servi.

Bonus: puoi prepararlo quando hai tempo e mangiarlo in un secondo momento che tanto è strabuono pure da freddo (una scaldatina alla salsa però gliela darei comunque, sennò resta troppo densa).

Però se hai fretta punto pure io sullo spago aglio olio e peperoncino.

Se poi hai voglia di cose strane, buttati sulle cosce/ali di pollo alla coca cola. Viene meglio se hai più persone a cena. Butta le cosce in una pentola alta, versaci coca cola fino a livello delle cosce e tipo mezzo bicchiere di salsa di soia. Metti su fuoco medio fino a che la coca non è diventata un po' densa -non dev'essere proprio caramellata-, togli le cosce dal fuoco, disponile su un piatto e inondale con la salsina. Molto simile alla salsa teriyaki, sta ricetta me l'ha fatta provare la mia insegnante di giapponese.
