* Ossetia and Abkhazia joined the Russian Empire as independent entities, separately from Georgia

* Ossetia and Abkhazia joined the Soviet Union as independent entities, separately from Georgia, and remained their own Soviet Socialist Republics until Stalin (himself a Georgian) made them a part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic as autonomous republics, which had a side effect that the vast majority of their officials throughout the Soviet times were Georgians.

* When Soviet Union held a referendum whether the state should be kept whole or disintegrate and the majority voted for keeping it together, the Georgian leadership acted against that will of the people and declared independence. Ossetia and Abkhazia were having none of it, and declared they're staying with the USSR - and later, as the Union crumbled, with Russia. They had an independence war with Georgia in 1992-1993, until by UN mandate Russia interfered, freezing the status quo and sending peacekeepers into the region. Ossetia and Abkhazia remained de-facto independent, never recognized by anyone as sovereign states.

* Georgia attacked the peacekeepers on numerous occasions (more than 150 dead of their number throughout 2000-2008), until in 2008 that culminated with a full-scale military action against Ossetia and the Russian peacekeeping contingent, which resulted in Russia interfering to restore the status quo, and led to Ossetia's and Abkhazia's recognition.",0,1376182427,null,0,1376586170,0,cbl7kkc,t3_1jw2t8,t1_cbl7kkc,t1_cbjewoi,null,1429873056,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Ethnic or cultural ties are much less fuzzy than some administrative division. 

The Basque movement is obviously based on cultural, linguistic and ethnic ties. In addition, their region is rather flourishing compared to the rest of Spain. And especially, it's very different from Sweden since Spain has very autonomous regions. 

If they were Castillan-speaking Spaniards, even decentralized from Madrid, they would have no independence movement. Hence, their basic claim for independence is that they are Basque, and not Castillan Spanish. The basis of their claim is that they are a different people. Hence why I don't really understand the multikulti stance, since, as I said before, it defeats the entire purpose. If they want to be multikulti, well they may as well be multikulti in Spain. 

I'd also like to add, and this is controversial, that the Quebec referendum in 1995 or so which lost by some ridiculous 49+%, was plagued by the fact that in many strongly immigrant neighborhoods of Quebec, there were 0 votes cast for independence. Basically, I kind of want to say that it won't be that easy to find supporters among immigrant populations who don't really get the fuss. And I don't blame them. They came here, and don't want their lifestyle to change because the natives have dreams of sovereignty. And also, many simply don't feel concerned. If Omar comes from Morocco and immigrates where he can in Spain because his life in Morocco sucked, and he happens to find an opportunity in the Basque Country, he typically will give no shits about Basque people's wishes.

I just feel independence movements are inherently an ethnic-cultural thing, and maybe I'm stupid, but I can't find the logic in leftist leaning regionalists. In France we have the Breton regionalists who are typically leftist, and I always thought it was ludicrous because your Arab immigrant typically gives no shit about the celtic identity. The typical Corsican regionalists are very right wing, borderline racist. And that seems more logical to me.

Personally I put in my tea bag and two sugar (cubes are the norm in my house), then hot water, and then milk, then squeeze the tea bag and drink. However the rest of my family have no sugar or, when they're feeling frivolous, one sugar. But some of my mother's friends take theirs with no milk or sugar. And then there's all the different kinds of tea. I go for just plain old boring tea like the own brand stuff *of a nice supermarket*. But lots of other people will go for things like decaffeinated or herbal teas or ones with fancy names. Earl grey is apparently a very popular kind, but I haven't tried it myself. 

I think that the way the rest of my family does it is the most common way to do it (normal-ish tea bag, milk, no sugar) but anyway is ok really.

I'd say most of my teachers (Portugal) had a British accent. I guess it was RP, some have a ""heavier"" British accent and others are more neutral. Teachers who work at British Council have an accent which sounds a lot more like an actual British person, but it always sounds a little fake to me.

In my view, most Portuguese people who are fluent in English have [this sort of neutral accent](http://youtu.be/DZMQoiQfSro). Maybe an English speaking person will think of it as more American-sounding, which is likely since they dominate TV and movies. I haven't tried it, but I think I could identify a Portuguese person by their accent. Then again, that's probably true of most nationalities, they all end up having their own quirks, which is why there's fun to be had at the expense of stereotyping accents. People who aren't as fluent sound a bit more like Borat. Mostly, Portuguese people have a problem with the ""th"" sound, which we don't really have.

I really like a lot of the UK accents, and it's hard for me to pick one. If I had to pick an accent based on how easy it would be to understand me, I'd just pick a ""normal"" accent, which I guess is a more Southern one. It's a little hard for me to distinguish between for example between David Mitchell's and Ricky Gervais's accent, other than one sounds a bit posher than the other. If I wasn't very interested in being understood, I'd like to be able to speak with Glaswegian accent or Mancunian one. The NZ accent also sounds neat.

I don't have much trouble understanding most accents, unless it's some some really isolated place inhabited by only one man and his sheep.

Another thing I've noticed walking around Lisbon where there are lots of tourists is that American accents are much more easily recognizable. As in, as soon as you hear it you can tell what it is. I think of myself as having a good ear for languages, and sometimes I can't even tell if someone is French or German after whole sentences. But Americans are much more loudspoken and have a very different enunciation from everyone else.

there are obvious a lot of opinions and different meanings to ""pride"", ""nationalism"" and ""patriotism"". the people in germany (IMO) differentiate a lot between these internally, as they do in discussion with others but can't vocalise it sometimes. 

as is it is unclear to anybody ""outside"" of the individuum to totally differ between these massive amount of meanings to ""pride"", ""nationalism"" and ""patriotism"", there is missing a common ground of understanding regarding the stance of german people to the flag of germany.

e.g.: before I went way outside of europe for a few months I had no emotional connection to the german flag (despite being a huge fan of the national football team ;), in 2006 for me that was something different but not inferior), 

but when I experienced troubles in culturally more foreign countries (than european countries) I realised the pros or rather perks of growing up in germany also with its flaws, especially when I saw the emblem and flag of germany at a consulate (not going into detail on this one for privacy sakes). Maybe it had something to do with the developing of a civil society or the lack of it, too.

This (in combination with a practical and theoretical infinite experiences) makes me proud to be german in SOME ways. the things I'm proud of, without going into to much detail, have a lot to do with things going on BEFORE the 20th and 19th and even the 18th century. 
These things like reformation, aufklärung, etc. seem to be went on a long time ago but still influence my education, flexibility, faith and mentally understanding of things, also handling difficult or challenging situations.

La majorité était UMP. Ce n'était pas une coalition, c'était un parti aux ordres qui vote généralement comme un seul homme et suivait systématiquement l'avis du gouvernement. Si une loi mettant la France en conformité avec le droit était dure à voter, c'est entièrement de la faute de l'UMP.

&gt; Des deux côtés, les lobbys et leur guerre de tranchées ont montré qu'ils étaient nocifs au débat et donc à la démocratie.

La démocratie, c'est ce qu'on a mis en place pour trancher les désaccord. Y a un désaccord clair, il a été tranché. Il y aurait un danger pour la démocratie si la majorité n'était pas en réalité indifférente à cette loi. Elle n'a mobilisé que quelques conservateurs. Même la plupart des homos n'étaient pas particulièrement demandeurs. Le danger pour la démocratie, ça relève du fantasme pur. Y a 5% de la population qui pense que la démocratie est en danger parce qu'ils découvrent qu'ils sont en minorité... (Je parle pas des gens opposés à la loi, je parle des gens qui adhèrent au discours selon lequel ça va provoquer un cataclysme dans notre société)

&gt; Il est facile pour un urbain cosmopolite d'être pro-mariage gay.

Pourquoi ce serait plus dur à la campagne ? Dans celle où j'ai grandi, les jeunes trouvent également l'homophobie ringarde et les quelques homos avoués sont bien intégrés. C'est pas plus dur qu'en ville. Être anti-mariage gay ne semble facile que chez les urbains Versaillais...

&gt; Il est plus difficile d'admettre que certaines craintes d'un changement profond et irréversible sont légitimes.

Mais on ne parle pas d'un changement profond et irréversible. On parle de gens qui vivaient en couple, qui adoptaient des enfants, qui étaient en union civile, et on parle de changer un peu leur statut légal pour que ce qu'ils faisaient déjà couramment devienne un peu plus facile. Pour prétendre qu'il s'agit d'un changement profond, il faut commencer par le prouver.

Et sur le plan législatif, il n'y a rien d'irréversible. Si le mariage gay venait à menacer notre civilisation, il n'y aurait pas de grande difficulté à revenir en arrière, s'il le faut à coup de révision constitutionnelle. C'est pas extrêmement simple, mais la guerre au Mali était plus dure à organiser que ce chantier législatif. C'est surement à la portée même de l'UMP. Le truc c'est que sous leur hypocrisie, les cadres de l'UMP savent que le mariage gay ne représente aucun péril pour la France, mais que la dissolution des mariages promulgués seraient un coup très dur porté à la respectabilité de la France d'un point de vue international, et causerait beaucoup de dommages pour un détail législatif réellement sans importance ni conséquence négative (et c'est prouvable: plusieurs pays ont légalisé le mariage gay, certains depuis longtemps. Allez y, cherchez les conséquences négatives, prouvez vos craintes vagues et irrationnelles, on vous attend.) 

L'opposition au mariage gay est un méli-mélo de peurs raccommodées entre elles avec beaucoup de fil blanc, mais assez peu de logique: irréversible (c'est faux) dangereux pour la société (c'est prouvablement faux) ouvrant à un ""droit à l'enfant"" consumériste (c'est factuellement faux) 

J'ajouterai que ceci est possible car cette opposition est hypocrite. Ils mettent en avant des arguments qui peuvent sembler neutre et respectables, mais ils savent au fond d'eux que les arguments qui les motivent sont principalement religieux ou instinctifs.

Sur le mariage gay, on a eu droits à des ""élites"" pour et contre. J'ai regardé les arguments, sur cette question que je trouve tout à fait mineure soit dit au passage, et les arguments ""pour"" m'ont paru tout à fait corrects. Les arguments ""contre"" n'étaient pas seulement mauvais ou contestables, ils étaient une insulte à la logique et à la notion d'égalité quand ils n’étaient pas simplement mensongers. Les arguments pour le TCE étaient bien construits mais reposaient à mon avis sur des bases bancales.

On the contrary, the French instructor brought that IPA chart in the very first lesson, in middle school.

The Austro-Hungarian army was quite incompetent in WWI that's true.

Saying that they were incompetent is like saying that the Serbian army was incompetent because it was defeated in both World Wars by Germans.

I just spent a year in the UK, and have therefore developed a distinctly South English accent — obviously native Englishmen immediately hear my Danish accent (which they often mistake for German), but interestingly most Americans I've met have taken me for British. Before I was in the UK, though, I spoke Californian English, on account of television… But before then, in middle school, I learnt RP.

In our school, we were taught we could do either, as long as we were consistent — both in idiomatic language use and spelling. Most people spoke American English, because it is simply more pervasive.

You are delirious, pure and simple. While you could argue there were war crimes against the Chechens, this claim is just out there.

&gt;Face it, the Russians not only fought very incompetent and were decimated by the Chechen fighters

First Chechen War military casualties: 5732 Russian vs 17391 Chechen, about 1 for 3.

Iraq War military casualties: 24219 coalition vs 28821 Iraq, about 1 for 1.

You were saying?

&gt;they put the Serbs and other Balkan war participants to shame regarding the extent of crimes

First Chechen War civilian casualties: 50 to 80 thousand by different estimates.

Iraq War civilian casualties: 110 to 600 thousand by different estimates.

You were saying?

&gt;So while I don't condone terrorism, I find the motives of the Budennovsk, Beslan etc. attacks understandable. They just wanted to make the Russians stop ravaging in their land.

Never mind that the Russian forces entered Chechnya after the Chechens had cleansed whatever Russian population they had and whatever opposition there was to their independence adventure, about 200k people total.

&gt;Where they ""won"" they still managed to kill well over a hundred hostages.

Look up counter-terrorist operations in comparable hostage crises, and you will see comparable or worse figures.

&gt;it's a little shameful for Russia that they had to bribe a Chechen warlord to get on their side and pacify the country for them

In a tribal society, Russia needed a friendly chief, so with his tribe's support, Russian army mopped up the remaining terrorists. Some kind of leadership was necessary, after all: it was that or pacifying the country once and for all. 

This is generally how things work, anyway - see the cases of al-Maliki or Karzai.

&gt;So Moscow now sends billions of dollars to this criminal warlord called ""president""

Moscow sends billions of dollars to every Federation subject, that's how federative budgeting works. Chechnya got disproportionately more for a while for the restoration effort, which is natural.

&gt;if Russia weakens again you bet that Kadirov guy will declare independence from Russia

As Stalin's times have shown, it takes around two weeks to round up the Chechens like cattle and drive them wherever decided (gas chambers included - that tends to stop guerrilla wars).

I quarter fill a teapot with cold tap water and place it in the microwave for ~60 seconds to preheat the pot. I then fill the kettle with filtered water and switch on. Whilst the water is boiling I put the loose tea in the teapot filter (one teaspoon per person and 'one for the pot') and fill a small milk jug with cold milk, placing it on a tray along with the cup(s). I retrieve the teapot from microwave, swirl the hot water around a bit then discard. The kettle will then click, so I insert the tea filter into the teapot, add the boiling water, and set a timer (usually 5 minutes, but depends on the tea). I transfer the teapot to the tray (biscuits and sugar bowl optional) and go and sit down. When the timer is up I add the milk to the cup then pour in the tea. The milk can be added after the tea, which is easier if one doesn't know how strong the tea will be, but I personally prefer to add it first. I don't take sugar any more.

I tend to drink loose black teas my current favourite being Regents Blend from Fortnum and Mason. I also quite like plain Assam or Ceylon, Queen Anne Blend (Assam/Ceylon), English Breakfast Tea (usually Assam/Ceylon/Kenyan) and occasionally Anhui Keemun.

I mostly work from home which makes all the above easier, when not at home I'd use a fill-your-own tea bag and add the milk second. Other than a Nan, I don't know anyone else who uses loose tea or a teapot. As SlyRatchet says, the host's way of doing tea is obviously superior! They will ask 'milk and sugar?' if they can't remember, and you're allowed to say how strong you like it if it bothers you.

Russian official casualty figures: well I think you know how reliable those were. Especially the number of the Chechen fighters they claimed killed, but they routinely denied/laundered their own losses too.

Well that was one of the lowest points for the Russian side but they lied systematically and boldfacedly during the whole war.

Note: medium and big business is involved into corruption schemes and most likely Tinkov's bank already controlled by FSB so he does not have to pay anything / a lot extra to prosecute that person - threat is real.

* Government assured Olympic committee that anti-gay law won't be enforced during Olympics - at least not in the Olympic town. I don't believe them - I think at best only sportsmen will be immune while civil rights activist will be prosecuted for sure.

* After authorities' effort to gather and deport thousands of illegal immigrants from Moscow it turned out 90% of the detained have provided false information about their identity - probably because they are planning to return to the country immediately after deportation (with new documents). Russia doesn't have any effective protection methods against illegal immigration besides basic papers check.

The World Police and Fire Games officially ended on Saturday with a closing ceremony in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast. The organisers declared it to be the ""best"" and ""friendliest"" games yet. 

This good news was unfortunately hidden underneath international coverage of violence which broke out in the centre of Belfast on Friday night, in the main shopping district. Republicans (Irish Nationalists) organised an anti-internment march through the city centre (they claim that Irish republicans are still being locked up in prison without trial... which isn't really true). 

British Loyalists (Unionists) organised a number of large counter-protests in response. Police stepped in to prevent the groups of people from coming into contact with another. Rioting broke out, sparked mainly by angry loyalists, with the police taking the brunt of it. 56 officers were injured, and thus the message sent around the world was not the good news of the successful World Police &amp; Fire Games being staged in Belfast, but images of bloody rioters, injured cops and burning cars.

true,Maldorno,null,null,"&gt;La majorité était UMP. Ce n'était pas une coalition, c'était un parti aux ordres qui vote généralement comme un seul homme et suivait systématiquement l'avis du gouvernement. Si une loi mettant la France en conformité avec le droit était dure à voter, c'est entièrement de la faute de l'UMP.

Oui, il n'y a jamais eu de gouvernement à majorité autre que UMP en France, l'arrêt incriminé étant rendu en 2001 et vu qu'on était déjà sous la tyrannie fachiste, hein. Plus les histoires d'indépendance des procureurs qui nous collent au cul. La gauche n'a jamais été en mesure de faire quoique ce soit à ce sujet. Tu vis dans l'illusion que la machine étatique n'est pas plus puissante que le jeu politique. Je crois pas pouvoir te réveiller à ce sujet, il faut le vivre pour le croire. 

&gt; Y a un désaccord clair, il a été tranché. 

Non, la démocratie, c'est les modalités d'arbitrage des désaccords. Il n'y a pas eu de débat, il n'y a pas eu de discussion. Le seul fait qu'il ait été tranché, ça aurait pu se produire sous un monarque de droit divin. 

&gt;Pourquoi ce serait plus dur à la campagne ?

Le sentiment de communauté est plus fort, l'anomie moins-disante moins développée. Après, on parle de campagnes, pas de régions péri-urbaines remplies de chômeurs. Comme tu le dis si bien, la majorité s'en fout. C'est une façon de penser majoritairement urbaine où il est facile de vivre loin de préoccupations communautaires.

&gt;Être anti-mariage gay ne semble facile que chez les urbains Versaillais...

Belle caricature, fausse, évidemment.

&gt; Pour prétendre qu'il s'agit d'un changement profond, il faut commencer par le prouver.

Pour parler de la même chose, il faut arrêter de faire semblant. Les modèles familiaux ont changé. Faut vraiment être de mauvaise foi pour le nier. Dire qu'il est illégitime de défendre un modèle qui ne semble aujourd'hui menacé que par un progrès technique omnipotent ( eugénisme merci, l'IMG entre autre c'est clairement une pratique eugéniste, même si elle est plutôt plébiscitée ) et des tactiques purement juridiques ( rendre le donneur anonyme ferait disparaître le géniteur ), c'est fort de café. 

&gt;Et sur le plan législatif, il n'y a rien d'irréversible.

Si, tape ""cliquet anti-retour droit"" sur Google. Si dans l'absolu, rien n'est vraiment irréversible car l'Etat peut disparaître, mais là on entre en terre inconnue, dans la pratique le législateur doit se soumettre à des règles internes.

&gt;L'opposition au mariage gay est un méli-mélo de peurs raccommodées entre elles avec beaucoup de fil blanc, mais assez peu de logique: irréversible (c'est faux) dangereux pour la société (c'est prouvablement faux) ouvrant à un ""droit à l'enfant"" consumériste (c'est factuellement faux) 

Oui, donc je m'arrête là. J'ai pas envie de refaire le débat, qui est effectivement pas très intéressant aujourd'hui. Tes approximations montrent bien que la ""science"" d'Eolas ne sert qu'à convaincre des convertis et ne leur apprend aucune notion utile de droit et que les jugements à l'emporte-pièce objectivement faux prolifèrent de chaque côté.

Some really stinging operations can certainly be done. What EU **can** hit is US B2B companies. B2C like Google is difficult, though threatening noises should be made in that way too (even if that's more bark than bite).

However, banning Cisco and Oracle from selling to the EU would be an insane blow to those companies while at the same time being perhaps a pain in the ass to some EU companies, but hardly anything fatal (plenty of replacements and it's all behind the scenes). The only way Cisco and Oracle could keep the business is by spinning off their EU operations and making them fully independent. The pain in the ass operationally on their end would make a 2 by 4 feel pleasant. It would also send a powerful signal that US government would have an insanely difficult time explaining its way through.

Still, the fundamental problem here is that yes, there is a ""US vs. the World"" balance of power here, but more fundamentally it's a ""People vs. Government"" balance of power.

I's say that it is extremely important to save them, to suffest otherwise is very, very naive, unfortunately. And, we (Sweden) spent 4 % of our GDP one year to save our banks, Finland spend 7-8 %. That is how important it is.

Our banks deserve to fail, as they are utterly corrupt. The state should have only handed out money to those depositors under the guaranteed limits, bringing the bankers to justice if they gambled with money which legally they weren't allowed to. The 250000 millions are only those handed out by Spain, although maybe it's all of it, because if I remember correctly the Troika insisted on giving that money to the banks through Spain so, if the banks fail to return them (which they will), the country still needs to give it back with interests.

&gt; Who are you going to sell them too?

You are going to hand them out, in the meantime, to the evicted families who can't support themselves anymore thanks to the measures of those last years.

It's estimated that the underground economy in Spain will reach 195,600,000,000€ by the end of this year. Only a portion of that would suppose a significant boost to the economy, easing the process of reforming the industry and helping the middle and lower classes to keep going.

&gt; So, you prefer to default, that would have been the case you know.

No, that is a false dichotomy. For now, I still think it's better not to default (although if things keep going in that direction, I may change my opinion about that). However, I prefer to avoid measures that sink people deeper in the crisis. As I said, most enacted measures have had a negative effect on the economy.

 Ghetto gym with old equipment and holes in the floor. Wouldn't trust the safety of my body there.

 Mostly cardio / machines. There is a small spiral staircase that brings you to a smallish but adequate free weight room. It was small, hot as balls and cramped. Looks like they renovated the place since I went tough so I don't know what it's like now.
* http://www.pailleron19.com/
 Machines, Cardio and zumba like stuff only. No free weights. I don't even think you can get a membership. You have to pay by the session and it's super expensive.
* http://www.enjoy-fkc.com/
 Huge place, modern, well equipped. I do think they have free weights but I don't remember. Ended up rejecting it because of the price and distance I think.
* Clubs meds gyms
There are a bunch of them around Paris. They are expensive and towards downtown. It's all I know.

true,HappyReaper,null,null,"&gt; Perhaps, but it is utterly unimportant. Tell me again, if every Spanish bank fails, how are you going to function as a country, every single person looses all they have, no one get a salary, no one can buy or sell anything - how are you going to function.

No, only the people with risky plans (which were giving them bigger interests) would lose their money, as the state would pay for those under the guaranteed limits. But anyway, after banks fail there are many options. Personally, I'm partial to nationalisation, but with the state managing them in the interest of the people (the nationalisation that was carried out only involved giving them money and swallowing their toxic actives).

&gt; But that does not give you any money to keep Spain afloat for the estimated two decades that it will take to make you competitive.

That is false. If people have a guaranteed home they are more eager to consume in other things and move the economy, ultimately producing income for the state. As it is now, they are paralised by the banks for future speculation.

&gt; FFS, it doesn't matter if 20 % of the economy, it still doesn't make you competitive.

It is a huge amount of money, which can be used to invest in a reform of the industry and a betterment of the middle class, both of which would impact economy positively.

&gt; Most of your suggestiong does not work, and even if they do, they are not even band aids.

I disagree, I think that they are viable and would generate positive results. But both of those possibilities (nothing or band-aid) are still better than throwing salt in the wound, which is basically what the current measures are doing.

&gt; You do not seem to understand the situation. Spain is not competitive. Selling houses will not make you so, nor being a country without banks. You seem more vengeful, than practical. Nothing of what you are suggesting would keep you afloat for decades and make you competitive, nothing. You are not even attempting to suggest anything that will make you competitive in the future. . Yet you blame IMF. Sigh.

That's because you put words in my mouth which I never said. I understand the situation perfectly. I never said anything about selling houses (I talked about using them to reactivate people's spending). I never talked about leaving a country without banks (I talked about letting the troubled ones fail, which is different, and opens other courses of action). I am not vengeful (although I would very much enjoy seeing the people responsible for the crisis before justice, but who wouldn't?), everything I say is with the future in mind. I didn't suggest that those measures would keep the country afloat for decades (I explicited that they should be used to cover the necessary reforms in the industry, which with the current measures seem further and further away everyday). I never placed the blame entirely on the IMF, not even the majority of it (I blame them for trying to mislead the population to further their ideological agenda, but the responsibility for the actual measures falls on the Spanish government, wich I've made clear several times).

 &gt; No, how would you have paid?

For what? for the borrowed money? The same way we did. I remind you that the measures have had a neat, negative effect on the economy, none of the money we used to pay back debts was generated by those measures.

C'est : 

1. un mythe colporté par des milieux libéraux bas du front

2. faux.

D'une part (et comme les gens sois-disant informés/doctes mais qui ne le sont pas) ça mélange impôts et cotisations et oublie les taxes. D'autre part ce chiffre de l'institut Molinari (à l'honnêteté intellectuelle au mieux douteuse au pire inexistante) ne prend en compte que les prélèvements sur le travail, sans considération des ""autres fruits"" de celui-ci que sont le patrimoine et le capital. Ce qui soit dit en passant montrerait que si la France prélève bcp sur le travail elle le fait assez peu sur le capital/patrimoine. Et ça ne fait aucune différence entre état et collectivités, sécu, autres. 

Si on prend l'ensemble des prélèvements obligatoires 47,5% du PIB (on y inclue donc les cotisation même si je trouve ça bête) et en partant donc sur cette fallacieuse considération : budget de l'Etat stricto sensu : c.a.d. les APUCentrales 300Mds€.

47,5% PIB (2000Mds€) = 951 Mds pour toute les adm° : APULocales, APUC et Sécu.
300Mds de 951 Mds = 31% des prélèvements obligatoires (47,5%PIB) et
300Mds de 2000 = 15% du PIB.

Donc si on parle de l'Etat je te laisse faire le (brillant) calcul sur le nombre de mois à travailler pour lui. Puis pour être honnête il faudrait faire la pondération des sommes dépensées qui se trouvent redistribuées directement/indirectement aux citoyens.


L'époque féodale ? Celle de la fin du ""droit public"" et de la domanialité des fonctions des terres et des charges ? Les impôts de l'époque féodal n'était jamais qu'un loyer que faisait payer des propriétaires à leurs ""locataire"". Ou comme la gabelle un achat d'une ""licence d'exploitation"".

Les exigences du droit Européens ont été clarifiées en 2008 et 2009. A partir de ce moment là, on ne pouvait plus ignorer que la France n'était pas en conformité. Mais il y a pire: après la condamnation de la France en 2010, la France n'a même pas mis sa loi en conformité. C'est pour ça que des tribunaux ont du annuler des PVs de garde à vue.

L'arrêt incriminé dont je pense que tu parles date de 2004. C'était un arrêt qui rendait la garde à vue plus proche du droit Européen, mais la CEDH a jugé que ce n'était pas assez.

&gt; Non, la démocratie, c'est les modalités d'arbitrage des désaccords. Il n'y a pas eu de débat, il n'y a pas eu de discussion.

Là, désolé, faut apprendre à lire. Le mariage homo était écrit noir sur blanc dans le programme de Hollande. La campagne présidentielle est le meilleur moment pour en parler, mais l'UMP ne s'est réveillée que lors de sa guéguerre interne et de sa course au plus intégriste. Perso j'aurais bien aimé un référendum (par principe je suis toujours pour les référendums) mais franchement, l'UMP qui fait le coup du ""ouin on a pas eu de débat"", après la législature qu'on vient d'avoir, c'est l'hôpital qui se fout de la charité. On a eu un référendum sur la sortie de l'OTAN ? Sur le traité de Lisbonne ? (ah oui tiens, on avait voté contre) Sur les retraites ? Sur le CPE ? Sur HADOPI ? On en aura pas plus sous le règne du PS, mais c'est franchement pas l'UMP qui est légitime pour porter cette critique.

&gt; Le sentiment de communauté est plus fort, l'anomie moins-disante moins développée. Après, on parle de campagnes, pas de régions péri-urbaines remplies de chômeurs.

&gt; Pour parler de la même chose, il faut arrêter de faire semblant. Les modèles familiaux ont changé. Faut vraiment être de mauvaise foi pour le nier. 

Ben... oui. C'est pour ça qu'on change la loi ! Tu veux faire quoi ? imposer un modèle de famille ? T'as vraiment envie que l'état te donne des conseils à ce niveau là ? 

&gt; Dire qu'il est illégitime de défendre un modèle qui ne semble aujourd'hui menacé que par un progrès technique omnipotent et des tactiques purement juridiques, c'est fort de café.

Tu défends un modèle menacé ? Ou tu tentes d'imposer à un modèle à chacun ? Tu as tout à fait le droit aujourd'hui de vivre dans le modèle traditionnel catholique. La nouvelle loi crée de nouvelle possibilités, pas de nouvelles interdictions. Les droits des personnes manifestant dans la manif pour tous n'ont strictement pas rétréci.

&gt; Si dans l'absolu, rien n'est vraiment irréversible car l'Etat peut disparaître, mais là on entre en terre inconnue, dans la pratique le législateur doit se soumettre à des règles internes.

C'est dingue, tu ne sais vraiment pas comment ta république fonctionne ? En démocratie, si, on peut tout. Voici un petit résumé de comment ça fonctionne : est ce que ce que tu veux faire est conforme à la loi ? Oui, alors fais un arrêt. Non, alors change la loi au parlement. Est ce que le changement est conforme à la constitution ? Oui, alors vote le changement à l'assemblée et au sénat. Non, alors fais une révision constitutionnelle (qui peu ou non mettre en péril l'appartenance à l'UE). 

Il n'y a rien qui soit hors de portée du législateur si 50% de la population ou 2/3 des députés+sénateurs sont derrière lui. Si la civilisation Française est menacée après cette horrible erreur qui va lancer sur nous les 7 plaies d'Egypte, pas de problème, le pays sera d'accord.

La liberté ce serait un mauvais argument ? Ce que j'ai dit c'est que les arguments ""contre"" sont pour certains des insultes à la notion d'égalité. Vanneste appelle l'homosexualité une ""aberration anthropologique"", Myard parle de perversion sexuelle, etc... Y en a pas mal comme ça.

The civilian losses in Iraq were mostly caused by other Iraqis, who committed suicide bombings, not the US. Only thing resembling Grozny was Fallujah, that was nasty urban combat, officially 95 American soldiers died in 2 months fighting. Afghanistan: The Soviet Army admittedly lost 14,453 KIA in Afghanistan 1979–1989. US and coalition lost 3,360 KIA since 2001. Better to compare the two Afghan wars then:) Of course the two aren't the same but took place in the same country at least. Also civilians killed: 16,725–19,013 (2001–2013).

true,CreepyOctopus,LATV,Latvia | Sweden,"Bit of a mess in Latvia.

British accent (RP, specifically) is what is generally taught in school and considered the correct pronunciation. But two factors make things more difficult. One, many English teachers speak pretty poor English (for a teacher) and have pronunciation that's neither here nor there. Two, for young people at least, the most significant source of English is not school but rather English-language culture. TV shows, movies, games, etc. And that is overwhelmingly American, so many develop a strange mix of pronunciations.

Personally, I'd rather speak British RP as I think it sounds better, but I am not that capable in terms of pronunciation, and am also greatly affected by mostly hearing American pronunciations, so I speak a British-American-Latvian mix.

I'm pretty good at distinguishing accents though thanks to large amounts of exposure. I can distinguish more than just US vs. RP, I'm also familiar with Australian, South African, several different varieties of US (southern, New York), Scottish. The most difficult native accents to understand are probably Scottish (though it sounds great) and Scouse. I'm in love with South African (the Afrikaans kind) accent.

I wish I were better at pronouncing the different accents.

Fairly intense pressure emanating from Silicon Valley against Washington while at the same time creating a precedent that EU would have a very hard time dealing with. If EU intelligence agencies would be doing the same thing (I'm sure they are) Ericsson and Nokia-Siemens might end up banned in the US... sucks for everyone, and the only way out seems to be the terrifying prospect of not creating a totalitarian surveillance state. Heaven forbid!

&gt; I note you're from Finland. Trying to prop up Nokia Siemens Networks, perhaps?

I was expecting the main winner to be Ericsson actually. And for the record I live in Boston (will be a US citizen soon) and work in the high tech industry, so I'd personally be a major potential loser if US businesses suffered. On the other hand if US intelligence services are allowed to run rampant, there's a huge potential than me and my children lose a hell of a lot more than 10% of our business.

&gt; While selling the same products? I can't see Cisco releasing different software releases for the EU and US, with the EU version having the hypothetical NSA backdoor taken out.

Like I said, it'd be an operational nightmare to basically open up the code to EU review on some level to check for back doors. Keeping two ""parallel"" products would be so blindingly obvious to anyone as well, never mind the hassle inside these companies.

&gt; (nb: I'm an employee of one of the companies in this comment)

The problem is that this is the UK clearly saying that no, they don't want to play by the same rules as the rest of the EU, that they want to retain strict controls that everyone else has given up. It sends a strong message of the UK not thinking of the EU as ""us"" but rather ""us and the rest of them"".

Further, look at why the UK doesn't join Schengen. They say it's to combat illegal immigration. This fits with the anti-immigrant attitude that the UK seems to have, and also shows distrust towards the rest of the EU. If the UK joined Schengen, they'd still remain an island. Meaning that the only people who get into the UK would be other EU citizens, or people who already entered the Schengen area through some other country.

I was reading the UKIP website a few days ago and it said something *like* this ""EU nationals who have been working in the UK for more than 7 years without a work permit will be able to apply to stay in the UK"". From that you can deduce that Europeans who've not been working in the UK for 7 years will be forced to return home and that these actions would be reciprocated by the European Union. But this is simply party policy and has the potential to change.

Taxing cars does make public transportation cheaper. It's all relative.

At the moment, cars are too cheap. Every car is a very bad thing because it causes a high amount of pollution and congestion per passenger-km, and has a significant chance of killing someone. 

I recognize that there are places where cars are the only really viable way of getting around, which is why I'm not talking about those places. I am talking about places there there are plenty of less anti-social alternatives, but people choose the car anyway, because they are mildly sociopathic and for them the extra cost isn't as important as the convenience.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I'm not so sure it would have such a difference though. If I was to distill your comment down to two points they would be 

* Adds balance to what is a mostly English country and

* Would make secession seem more feasible. 

For the first one I don't think it would make much difference because England already makes up 50 million of the UK's sixty million population. That's 83 percent of the total population. If Scotland left then there would be about 55 million people in the UK but it wouldn't change much. Wales, Scotland and NI already are make up a minority of the UK population and Scotland leaving wouldn't change that.

The Labour and Lib dems would have to become a bit more right wing, yes, but it still wouldn't change that much and I think people would quickly get used to it. Sure they wouldn't be quite as happy, but the difference is negligible.

Secondly I, as for part of the UK becoming independent and that proving that it can be done, I think that's not really something which needs to be proved. We need only look at the Republic of Ireland to see how it might turn out and realise that it went alright. Could be better, could be worse. 

I'm not trying to undermine your points completely. You've definitely got a point. It would spur Welsh nationalism and perhaps calls for independence, but I think that if we look at it historically that not much which is new would actually happen. It would be a predominantly English country before and after and there have been parts of the UK which seceded before. It's nothing particularly new. 

It wouldn't be some new catalyst for change. It would be a nudge for independence movements. But it wouldn't be a shove. ",0,1376251184,null,0,false,0,cblnjl2,t3_1k4zwm,t1_cblnjl2,t1_cblhlv7,null,1429865408,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

In that page:

&gt;How does last-place aversion play out with regard to redistribution? In our surveys, we asked Americans whether they supported an increase to the minimum wage, currently $7.25 per hour. Those making $7.25 or below were very likely to support the increase – after all, they would be immediate beneficiaries. In addition, people making substantially more than $7.25 were also fairly positive towards the increase. Which group was the most opposed? Those making just above the minimum wage, between $7.26 and $8.25. We might expect people who make just below and just above $7.25 to have similar lifestyles and policy attitudes – but in this case, while those making below $7.25 would benefit if the minimum wage were raised to, say, $8.25, those making just above $7.25 would run the risk of falling into a tie for last place.

This is absolutely ludicrous, it assumes the minimum wage increases wages and not unemployment.

Those who make less than 7.25$/hour would continue to remain unemployable if the minimum wage were to be raised and probably have been duped into thinking it would actually help them.

The people making just above 7.25$/hour would obviously oppose any such change because they know they'd either have to do something else to make up for their higher wage or they'd lose their employment.

People making way more than 7.25$/hour would be unaffected by any such change as they wage is much more than the minimum wage rate.

This is not psychology nor is it a paradox, it's wage and price controls and who benefits and who loses from it.

Voglio dire, mi capita spesso di leggere un libro o vedere un film che per anni mi era stato descritto come un classico imperdibile, e alla fine mi rendo conto che il libro o il film non regge il paragone con i suoi contemporanei, che è ingenuo, formulaico e poco originale. 

Poi però ovviamente ci penso un secondo e capisco che sto capovolgendo la realtà: se mi appare formulaico e poco originale è proprio perché ha avuta tale influenza sulle opere successive che ormai è come se l'avessi già letto mille volte senza averlo veramente letto. 

In un genere tutto sommato giovane come la SF è molto facile che capitino cose del genere perché il genere cresce in qualità di decennio in decennio. Stessa cosa vale per il fantasy: anche solo negli anni '80 una serie della complessità di ASOIAF sarebbe stata impensabile. Ma oggi sono tante le serie fantasy altrettanto ambiziose. 

Il punto per me è che i classici vanno approcciati in maniera diversa rispetto a un'opera contemporanea. Come lettore devi sempre avere presente che si tratta di un libro che si è guadagnato l'etichetta di classico per quello che era al momento della pubblicazione, rispetto alla letteratura dell'epoca.

Citant Frédéric Bastiat :

""Supposez que le gouvernement intervienne. Il est aisé de deviner le rôle qu’il s’attribuera. Son premier soin sera de s’emparer de toutes ces caisses sous prétexte de les centraliser et, pour colorer cette entreprise, il promettra de les grossir avec des ressources prises sur le contribuable. Mais, je le demande, que sera devenue la moralité de l’institution quand sa caisse sera alimentée par l’impôt ; quand nul, si ce n’est quelque bureaucrate, n’aura intérêt à défendre le fonds commun ; quand chacun, au lieu de se faire un devoir de prévenir les abus, se fera un plaisir de les favoriser ; quand aura cessé toute surveillance mutuelle et que feindre une maladie ce ne sera autre chose que de jouer un bon tour au gouvernement ? (...) Il nommera des vérificateurs, des contrôleurs, des inspecteurs, on verra des formalités sans nombre s’interposer entre le besoin et le secours. Bref, une admirable institution sera, dès sa naissance, transformée en une branche de police. Les ouvriers ne verront plus dans la caisse commune une propriété qu’ils administrent, qu’ils alimentent, et dont les limites bornent leurs droits. Peu à peu, ils s’accoutumeront à regarder le secours, en cas de maladie ou de chômage, non comme provenant d’un fonds limité préparé par leur propre prévoyance, mais comme une dette de la société. L’État se verra contraint de demander sans cesse des subventions au budget. Là, rencontrant l’opposition des commissions de finances, il se trouvera engagé dans des difficultés inextricables. Les abus iront toujours croissant, et on en reculera le redressement d’année en année, comme c’est l’usage, jusqu’à ce que vienne le jour d’une explosion. Mais alors on s’apercevra qu’on est réduit à compter avec une population qui ne sait plus agir par elle-même, qui attend tout d’un ministre ou d’un préfet, même la subsistance, et dont les idées sont perverties au point d’avoir perdu jusqu’à la notion du droit, de la propriété, de la liberté et de la justice """,0,1376253515,null,0,false,0,cbloawl,t3_1k5doj,t1_cbloawl,t1_cblo143,null,1429865054,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

Federal US taxation is ~25% of GDP and the variation in spending levels between rich and poor states is ~5% of GDP, so a variation of roughly 20% of federal spending.

How big a budget would the EU need to be able to slosh around 5% of combined GDP into the poor regions (bearing in mind the current budget is only 1% (and heavily constrained by CAP payments)?

The other point is that americans accept this, they are all american, whereas we are rapidly finding out just how german the germans are, and finnish the finns are, when it comes to firehosing cash at nations they consider to be essentially delinquent! In the UK this 'sloshing' occurs in the form of:

national pay-bargaining which benefits poorer regions (teachers, nurses, etc) 

national social benefits more generous than poorer regions could afford alone (eg.housing benefit in glasgow) 

targeted regional development grants/discounts to encourage business growth (objective 1 EU/WEFO funds) 

additional infrastructure spending to support the local economy (the mainland-skye bridge) 

operating national services hubs from depressed regions to boost wages (DVLA in swansea, etc)

Unless Germany recognises the 'familial' relationship, and the obligation that goes along with that, then it needs to leave for the good of its neighbours.

Nice and close spots :

* Caen (NE, 45 minutes by car, a castle, two abbeys, and the memorial - you can easily spend two full days there)

* Saint Malo (SW, 1h by car, a wonderful old city with walls and a few islands, on with you can go at low ebb)

* Bayeux (NE, 1h by car, the tapestry and an OK cathedral)

* Rennes (S, 1h by car, nice city with enough to see for a full day; far, but on the highway)

* The D-Day locations : Omaha beach and the American cemetery, La Cambe and the German cemetery, Arromanches, etc. I'd guess between 1h and 1h30 to get to each of them (there are some small roads), except perhaps La Cambe, which is closer to the highway.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Just thought I should expand your list on further.

A UKIPer might also think that the EU restricts economic growth in certain ways and also restricts our freedoms. For instance they would argue that the EU dictates that we must accept economic migrants from all over Europe and not accept other kinds of migrants from other areas which we might want to. And is therefor a restriction on our freedom.

Additionally they argue that to protect the free market we're not allowed to pursue more favourable trade deals with other, developing, countries because that would affect the common market as a whole in a negative way but not the United Kingdom, specifically, in a negative way. So that's bad for freedom and economic growth also. 

Personally I think these arguments don't amount to much because the benefits of being in the European Union and losing such freedoms far outweigh having these freedoms. 

Last thing @ggow, thanks for portraying eurosceptic views. Even if they're not your personal views it's good that they are being aired. Usually this place can end up being a bit naïve about the UKIP position and just assume it's bad without understanding. Both sides should be understood.

Take for example if two independent individuals decided(with their own freedom of will and opinion) that who ever lost in chess against the other would be executed. That would fall in perfectly in **a** definition of freedom but the individual who won the match would still exert power over the other which wouldn't be in accordance of your definition of liberalism.

Non è una questione di libri datati o obsoleti: ad esempio Notre-Dame de Paris, scritto nell'800, è un libro che ho trovato scritto in modo molto moderno. Ad essere ancora più precisi, non è un fatto di modernità e contingenza: quando leggo Tolstoj o Dostoevskij, mi rendo conto che la prosa è quello che è in quanto libro di due secoli fa, ma questo non mi impedisce di goderne il contenuto stimolante quale è. Non mi faccio assolutamente problemi a leggere libri esteticamente datati, se hanno qualcosa di stimolante da offrirmi.

&gt;Stessa cosa vale per il fantasy: anche solo negli anni '80 una serie della complessità di ASOIAF sarebbe stata impensabile.

Non sono d'accordo, Tolkien, sebbene in un modo tutto suo e in gran parte diverso, ha creato un'opera colossale, e questo nella prima metà del '900.

Quello che voglio dire, è che non è lo stile di scrittura che può apparire obsoleto ai nostri occhi (altrimenti leggerei solo contemporanei) a non farmi piacere il libro, è il contenuto a renderlo un libro che vale la pena leggere (per me).

true,BabyWookie,RUSS,Russia,"Hey, I am supposed to the big Russia defender in this thread, but I will readily admit that the First Chechen War as an epic disaster and a travesty. 

However, let me put into context for you: It was a truly nasty, hellish, brutal civil war, fought by the gutted, dilapidated, understaffed, impoverished, demoralized remains of the Soviet military against their own people in terrible conditions.

Just before the War, the powers that be, threw the switch and nearly instantly turned Russia from a Second World country into a Third World One, which couldn't afford a properly sized and equipped, operational military. A lot of best, most experienced officers had quit, because, the government, after redeploying them to the Russian Federation from the different Soviet republics, was not able to provide them and their families with decent housing or pay them (they often went without pay for many months). The military also couldn't afford to properly feed, train or equip their conscripts, creating terrible morale problems and causing high conscription dodging and desertion rates. The ""dedovschina"" (the culture of brutal conscript hazing) was at an all-time high and alcohol and drug abuse was prevalent. They could barely afford fuel for their vehicles too. 

Most of Russia's motorized infantry regiments were at half strength and not battle-ready. Right before the war, they quickly combined them into joined units. Some times, they created combined regiments from different branches of the armed forces. There was often a lot antagonism and lack of “unity” in such units. 

Urban combat training and tactics were practically non-existent. These rag-tag joined regiments were sent into Grozny in large columns from different directions. 

The Chechens were lead by former Soviet generals, who knew the Russians' doctrine and tactics from inside and out. Many of their field-commanders were former Soviet officers and combat vets too. Hell, most of their combatants had served and were trained by the Soviet Military, making them better trained than the contemporary Russian conscripts.

Also, when the Soviets/Russians first pulled out in 1991, Yeltsin, in his infinite wisdom, decided to leave the Chechens with giant stockpiles of weapons, most importantly, with a hundred thousand or so RPG warheads. 

The Chechens also knew that the Russians were coming back and had three years to prepare for this. They had swindled the Russian government out of billions of dollars and used these funds to buy weapons, gear and hiring mercs, including Russian ones. They had wisely invested in the latest Western radios, scanners and satellite phones, which gave them a great edge over the Russian forces and their outdated Soviet comm equipment. They were commonly able to intercept all Russian comms and act on the info gathered, such as rapidly re-deploying and concentrating their forces in a specific area, setting up ambushes, fortifying positions, etc. 

The Chechens’ had smaller numbers, but they were able to use their comm advantage and familiarity with the terrain to rapidly re-deploy their forces to counter (ambush) individual Russian columns, typically out-numbering the Russians in a specific area of engagement. The Russian leadership had greatly underestimated that Chechens' capabilities and resolve; they figures that as soon as the Chechens got some bombs dropped on them and saw the giant AFVs columns roll in, they would shit themselves, and (literally) run for the mountains. Instead, the Chechen lured these columns into the city, systematically ambushing, trapping and destroying them, using the proper urban insurgency tactics, such as highly coordinated, mobile RPG and sniper teams operating from elevated positions. The Russian's AFVs have notoriously low angles of turret elevation and were commonly not able to return fire, while not being properly supported by the infantry, getting hit by multiple RPG rounds, before being disabled or destroyed. Eventually, the Russians deployed truck-mounted and self-propelled AA guns as fire support for their columns. 

There was also a great lack of communication and coordinated between different units and branches. A lot of the Russian casualties were due to “friendly fire” incidents. 

Russian journalist and Duma deputy Alexander Nevzorov, who extensively covered the First Battle of Grozny, had estimated that there were maybe a 100 properly trained and equipped Russians fighters (Alpha and GRU operators) taking part in the battle. 

A lot of these fighting later in the War was done by SOBR – SWAT officers, which were brought to Chechnya from all over the Russian Federation for counter-insurgency operations, which they were better suited for than the regular army. The military didn't like these “cops” and often ignored their requests for resupply, reinforcements, relief and air support. Most of the time, they were on their own.

Granted, the OMON and SOBR (mostly OMON, who were the less trained and professional cops) were known to brutalize the Chechens (including some publicized massacres of civilians), who, in return, took it out of the conscripts. That's part of the reason for the general animosity. Also, their involvement in the crackdown on the pro-democracy protesters in the late 80's and early 90's...

We had actually learned a lot from the First War. The morale, conditions, tactics, communications, air/artillery support were all much better and outside of a few, very publicized disastrous incidents, we were kicking ass. Also, the Chechens and other Whahabists that we were facing weren't quite of the same grade, as most of the ""higher grade"" ones were killed in the first war. Most of the time, we were fighting a bunch of incompetent, barely literate, drugged-up (amphetamines), lice bearded, Islamist lunatic thugs. 

As far as you comment on the incompetency of our anti-terror special forces (FSB Alpha and Vympel), just like the rest of our armed forces (and Russia in general) they were in a pretty rough state during the 90's and did botch the Hospital Hostage Crisis. However, by the 00's, they were back to a decent shape and handled the Moscow Theater Hostage Crisis and the Beslan School Hostage Crisis with a great degree of skill and professionalism, when all things are considered. Both events were unprecedented in the history of terrorist hostage takings and when you consider all of the factors, ideal outcomes (no hostages or security personnel lost) were pretty much impossible. According to international anti-terror doctrines, such severe, high-risk hostage rescue operations are considered a success as long as the irreversible casualties (deaths) are kept =&lt; 30%. 

In Moscow, you had dozens of heavily armed fanatics, without any reasonable demands... who came there to die, holding close to a thousand people in an enclosed space that's been wired to explode. After three days, the Chechens had threated to shoot someone at regular intervals and people would have began to drop dead from dehydration as they had received no water. Any kind of conventional storming would have resulted in the explosives going off, with a likely roof collapse. The knock-out gas was a brilliant idea, really. However, in order to ensure that it worked in such a large area, they had to pump enough of it to fill every corner, resulting in an overexposure to the people sitting closest to the air vents. Alpha went in and did they jobs, eliminating all of the terrorists without taking losses or causing any of the explosives to go off. They proceeded to pull out the hostages and offer proper first aid, but there were too few of them to do it all and most of the rescue and first aid was conducted by the first responders such as firefighters, who were not prepared for it, due to the incompetence of the local authorities. A lot of people died when the first responders dragged them outside and placed them laying on the backs, causing them to asphyxiate on their own vomit. They should have been placed on their sides. Still, the vast majority of people were saved.

In Beslan, the situation was equally or even more dire, with the presence of the armed locals complicating things. Instead of a pro-active, controlled operation, Alpha and Vympel were forced to react to an unexpected development. They took heavy losses, when rushing the Chechen machine gun nests and then shielding children with their own bodies. In two instances, operators were killed when they jumped on top of grenades which were thrown into crowds of children.

By they way, buying Kadyrov Clan's loyalty, making him ""The King of Chechnya"" (as long as he ultimately stays loyal to Moscow) and have him do the ""dirty work"" for us, was a great tactic for pacifying the locals. Americans have learned from us and used similar tactics of ""divide and conquer"" to pacify the similarly tribal Iraq.",0,1376265721,null,0,1376267044,0,cblsam4,t3_1jw2t8,t1_cblsam4,t1_cblgbot,null,1429863192,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The Intempo skyscraper in Benidorm, Spain—standing proud in this image—was designed to be a striking symbol of hope and prosperity, to signal to the rest of the world that the city was escaping the financial crisis. Sadly, the builders forgot to include a working elevator.

In fairness, the entire construction process has been plagued with problems, reports Ecnonomia. Initially funded by a bank called Caixa Galicia, the finances were recently taken over by Sareb – Spain’s so-called ""bad bank"" – when the mortgage was massively written down.

In part, that was a function of the greed surrounding the project. Initially designed to be a mere 20 storeys tall, the developers got over-excited and pushed the height way up: now it boasts 47 storeys, and will include 269 homes.

But that push for more accommodation came at a cost. The original design obviously included specifications for an elevator big enough for a 20-storey building. In the process of scaling things up, however, nobody thought to redesign the elevator system—and, naturally, a 47-storey building requires more space for its lifts and motor equipment. Sadly, that space doesn't exist.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the architects working on the project have resigned, and it remains unclear exactly how the developers will solve the problem. Can we recommend the stairs? ",0,1376270397,null,0,false,0,cbltrw2,t3_1k66ri,t1_cbltrw2,t3_1k66ri,null,1429862489,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

I don't hold the Middle East to the same cultural standards as Europe because they aren't Europe- socially, culturally, structurally, economically, geographically. The only reason anyone would ever say something as asinine as the contrary is because they've never travelled to that region or experienced the cultures present in it. They are, with little exception, extremely socially regressive in a very broad sense and on a level that would cause full-scale rioting if Dubai were suddenly transported to Belgium.

Ma non discuto il valore di classici 'classici' come Guerra e Pace o Don Chisciotte (per quanto insisto che io questi libri devo leggerli con uno spirito e delle aspettative diverse rispetto a quando leggo un romanzo contemporaneo).

Per quanto riguarda Tolkien, sì, non metto in dubbio il valore delle sue opere, e per riallacciarmi a quello che dicevo nel commento precedente, è ovvio che Il Signore degli Anelli sia un classico nel suo genere e uno dei libri più influenti del ventesimo secolo, per cui va letto come minimo per un interesse culturale. 

Però mettiamo un'ipotetica persona che legge molto fantasy e predilige quello moderno e non ha mai letto Tolkien, il giorno in cui si dovesse finalmente decidere di leggerlo, sono convinto che ne resterebbe perplessa: quelle lunghissime disquisizioni sugli hobbit e sull'erba pipa (il cosiddetto *infodumping*), quelle strane incongruenze, come la volpe parlante verso l'inizio del romanzo (!), la mancanza di ambiguità dei personaggi che sono tutti precisamente categorizzabili in buoni e cattivi (forse con poche eccezioni: Smeagol o Boromir), sono tutte cose che in un romanzo fantasy moderno lo renderebbero inpubblicabile.

true,PointAndClick,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt;Taxing cars does make public transportation cheaper. 

It's not making it more affordable either. That's what we want: Affordable transport. Not forced by an economic necessity.

&gt;Every car is a very bad thing

That's why everybody is using it? Name one driver who has a desire to pollute a desire to congest and a desire to kill. They don't exist. And practically every person in a car in NL is acutely aware of this. They're not stupid and they're not sociopaths. That's way too simplistic of a thought. You're talking about your fellow Dutch full human beings. In NL they are not stupid or sociopaths, that simply doesn't fly. If you need to be degrading for the sake of being right, you should do a bit more thinking, because there is something intrinsically wrong with your ideas.

&gt;Only significant disincentives will prevent this.

This is my biggest gripe with your philosophy. These things in the past have [proven not to work](http://scholar.google.nl/scholar_url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/226966709_Effects_of_economic_disincentives_on_private_car_use/file/5046351962008c7648.pdf&amp;sa=X&amp;scisig=AAGBfm00PMYEtBtNK0OhrC4oIBUxeMHaHg&amp;oi=scholarr&amp;ei=H4QIUoXKNMaQtAbGmoDICg&amp;ved=0CCoQgAMoATAA). The effects of disincentives are weak, it's not a solution to the problem. 

We need a solution that removes as much of the negative consequences, but maintains as much of the benefits and perks of what a car is and does. Your solution removes both, which is why it doesn't work.

As a side note, I want to add that the chance of killing someone with a car in NL is not significant, in fact it is in the low end (6 deaths per 100k) and in 2005 we were the safest country *in the world* when it came to road safety. Of course I agree that road safety should be a priority, but it's not really valid if the rest of the world has us to live up to. We are an example country when it comes to road safety.

Il a quand même été passé en force, et l'Europe n'a pas les outils pour y réagir. Bravo les mecs. On m'a proposé le TCE, présenté comme une constitution, j'y ai pas vu la constitution d'un état démocratique qui puisse fonctionner. La règle du consensus des 27 est paralysante pour toute décision et tant qu'on ne saura pas passer outre, l'Europe sera une construction sans moelle épinière. Le manque de marge de manœuvre de l'Europe et de ses membres était gravé dans le traité de Lisbonne.

I honestly can't understand why people fail to grasp this. Nobody cares about the Islamic societies because we aren't associated with them. The same way we didn't care too much that Japan came clean with every vile thing they did in WW2.

We are far more critical of our cousins than outsiders and for good reason.

Le sionisme est l'idée que l'Etat de Palestine appartient de droit au peuple juif et que donc si quelqu'un d'autre vit à cet endroit c'est à eux de dégager pour laisser la place à ses propriétaires ""légitimes"" (enfin légitimes selon leurs croyances...). 

Cela n'a rien à voir avec l'autodétermination, c'est une idéologie nationaliste. 

De nombreux juifs sont d'ailleurs anti-sionistes, les premiers antisionistes étaient d'ailleurs des orthodoxes juifs avant même la création d'Israël.

&gt;Il est difficile de s'opposer à ces droits surtout après la seconde guerre mondiale.

C'est rigolo mais d'une certaine manière je suis d'accord avec toi mais pas au sens où tu l'entends. Il est effectivement très difficile de s'opposer au sionisme aujourd'hui à cause de la surexploitation de la Shoah.

Also you can't take a project and expand it without an architect giving its signature, and the ""college of architects"" too (sorry, don't know the proper name, here it is called ""colegio de arquitectos"").
