true,crocowhile,null,null,"1. Non ho mai avuto nessuna velleita' di entrare in parlamento. Semplicemente, conosco e seguo da anni alcuni dei fondatori di FARE e sono strafelice che abbiano trovato una piattaforma per far sentire la voce della ragione nel panorama politico Italiano. Mi sono candidato perche' era un modo come un altro per aiutare (ho fatto anche il sito per la circoscrizione europa - si aiuta dove si puo').

2. Questa non e' una cosa facile da fare. Ci sta provando Giannino da settimane ma, come puoi capire, e' complicato. Il motivo e', come tu ben sai, che tanti votano in Italia non a favore di qualcuno ma contro qualcuno; i sostenitori del PD votano sinistra perche' hanno il terrore di Berlusconi. I sostenitori di Berlusconi votano PdL perche' hanno il terrore dei comunisti. Tutta la politica Italiana e' incentrata su questo spauracchio e sulla base di questo, immagino che ci siano migliaia di ipotetici elettori di Berlusconi o di Bersani che voterebbero FARE ma non lo fanno per paura di disperedere il voto. Il modo migliore che ho per convincerli, e' sperare che si accorgano che destra e sinistra, in Italia, non sono poi cosi' diverse l'una dall'altra. Di sicuro non per quanto riguarda la politica interna: entrambe non fanno altro che alzare le tasse, entrambe hanno paura delle riforme, entrambe si basano su alleanze minatorie che le ingessano anche sui temi per cui in teoria avrebbero dovuto prendere piu' consensi. C'e' anche un altro fattore che mi vergono un po' a dire perche' e' un po' offensivo, ma tant'e': se davvero un elettore considera seriamente di voler votare Berlusconi dopo tutto cio' che ha fatto, dubito che ci sia nulla di sensato che possa raccontargli per fargli cambiare idea.

3. Immagino che tantissimi candidati si siano uniti con lo stesso spirito con cui mi sono unito io: per puro scopo collegiale, con la voglia di provare a cambiare le cose. Nessuno si aspettava in principio che avremmo eletto parlamentari e questo teneva lontano coloro che avevano solo voglia di poltrona. Adesso le cose sono cambiate e c'e' la possibilita' concreta di portare un po' di gente in parlamento. Benvenga, ma lo spirito iniziale rimane comunque.

4. Credo sia il suo modo di pescare tra chi ne ha le palle piene, chi aveva deciso di non votare piu' o chi stava pensando di votare M5S ma riconosce che le proposte di Grillo sono campate in aria.

5. Chissa se Sallusti si e' reso conto di averci fatto una pubblicita' enorme a gratis?

Whatever the reason, catholic churches are catching up very fast - despite being ultraconservative as ever (or even more). It does not help, does it?

The point is, in the good cases at least, that it is more efficient investment of time to pay kids for getting good grades than to waste their time working in McDonalds when they could be reading the statistics textbook before the exam one more time. 

It is work, just the different kind. Schoolwork.

So this is why I don't really understand the get-independent-at-18 logic, why is it worse to get paid by parents for studying well than to get paid for doing some really crappy work any person with much lower education could do?

Oh, I forgot the class consciousness we Eastern Europeans are really ""good"" at, I think Southern Europe too. Stuff like people from a middle-class, white-collar family doing blue collar, physical work? That would cross class divides and be seen as a prole by your friends and get ridiculed. So either people do white collar work, where they have at least a little chance to brag their friends about making some career (if you are just the last nobody in a bank you can still put on ""banker airs"" to your friends etc.) or no work at all as long as the parents have money.

However I remember how hard it is to get a job at 24 with good grades but a literally empty CV, so I am actually not sure anymore. In the few interviews I had it was extremely frustrating to be able not to point to anything got done, any achievement in my life than good grades. I guess when I will have kids I will try to push them to do some CV-filling work during the university.

In sostanza, Giannino dice che a questo giro ci si e' concentrati su cio' che serve a tirarci fuori dall'oblio imminente. Per tutto il resto, si mantiene un atteggiamento liberale coerente col programma economico e cioe': non e' compito dello stato decidere cosa e' moralmente giusto e cosa non lo e'. Quindi no alla legge sulla procreazione assistita, si' ai matrimoni gay, si' allo stato laico etc. Su tutto cio' che tocca l'aspetto morale, FARE da' liberta di pensiero ai propri esponenti e non impone una linea di partito, che mi sembra la cosa piu' sensata.

Per quanto mi riguarda: 
1. sono favorevole ai matrimoni gay (in realta' fosse per me abolirei proprio l'istituzione del matrimonio che mi sembra obsoleta ma questo e' un argomento da salotto che ci porta lontano).
2. sono favorevole all'adozione da parte di coppie di qualsiasi orientamento o anche di singoli.
3. sono per uno stato laico e zero ingerenze religiose
4. niente falsi moralismi: penso sia ora di risdoganare temi come la legalizzazione delle droghe leggere e la legge merlin, senza pudori religiosi/conservativi.

&gt;They are not in or affiliated with the EU in any way. So why are they trying to buy democracy off to change EU Data Protection Proposals?

&gt;Because they don't want our data being protected. They want to use it to screw us over. These are the same people who are pushing for ACTA, SOPA, whatever bloody acronym it's called nowadays. These are the people who are warning about (read: threatening) a trade war with the EU, simply because the EU is trying to keep the internet and people's data on it free.

&gt;These American corporate lobbyists **are not on your side. They do not give a fuck about you, at all.** They are trying to bribe their way through purely for their own benefit. They want money, power, and any threat to them or their American corporate hegemony (like, say, data protection laws) destroyed.

Cosa ne pensi degli arrivati della politica? Ho scoperto che un mio conoscente, gran drogato dalle tendenze antisociali e nemico dello Stato, si è candidato con una lista collegata a quella del sobrio Monti. Ha un parente famoso. 

Perché Montezemolo vi ha schifati dopo avere aperto al vostro partito? Se non sbaglio ci sono state scintille (sicuramente rientrate per questioni di opportunità) anche con Boldrin che accusava Giannino di essere una primadonna.

Perché avete voluto Emma Marcegaglia con voi, della quale si dice abbia pagato tangenti per vedersi assegnati degli appalti e le cui aziende sembrano non rispettare i criteri di sicurezza, causando molte ""morti bianche""? Non eravate voi quelli della legalità e del libero mercato mondato dalle storture del sistema italiano?

Cosa ne pensi delle parole del sobrio Monti che vuole tagliare le cosiddette ali estreme? È accettabile prendersela col sindacato più grande d'Europa, rifiutandosi di rappresentare anche quelle persone accusandole neanche troppo velatamente di essere la causa della bassa competitività italiana? 

È corretto chiamare conservatore chi non vuole vedersi cancellare i diritti acquisiti con lotte negli ultimi decenni? È giusto levare tutele ad alcuni per portarle a quelle di chi non ne ha? Credi davvero che un licenziamento più facile significhi maggiore competitività o è solo una scusa per trovare manodopera non specializzata a basso costo facilmente sfruttabile per via del timore di essere licenziati con una scusa?  

Ha senso aumentare l'età pensionabile quando ci sono tanti giovani che non hanno un lavoro? Credi che il precariato sia una tattica per fare versare contributi che non verranno mai resi sotto forma di pensioni per evidente impossibilità ad accumulare sufficienti anni di lavoro con regolare contratto?

Come pensa Giannino di fare fronte agli almeno 50 miliardi di euro annui da tagliare per i prossimi 20 anni? 

Vi riterreste soddisfatti se doveste superare il 3%? Continuereste a fare politica o morireste nel giro di cinque anni? Lasceresti la ricerca per continuare a fare politica o ti divideresti tra laboratorio e seggio?

Qual è la posizione di FID in merito all'acquisto degli F-35, del TAV, del ponte sullo Stretto, della costruzione del MUOS? 

Secondo te i Patti Lateranensi sono conciliabili con uno Stato che si dice laico e che crede nel libero mercato? FID pensa di rivederli o anche voi trovate rifugio sotto la sottana di Santa Madre Chiesa, se non altro per non inimicarvi le gerarchie ecclesiastiche?

Il sobrio Monti ha confessato di avere creduto in Berlusconi nel lontano '94. Siamo sicuri che pure Giannino non abbia preso questo abbaglio, sollevando dubbi sulle sue qualità di osservazione?

Nel caso si dovesse votare su temi sensibili come questioni di bioetica, FID si schermerebbe dietro il comodo paravento della ""libertà di coscienza"" o darebbe indicazioni chiare su come votare?

Cosa ne pensi della magnificazione di Oscar Giannino come unico possibile salvatore della patria? O della comunicazione pop dal gusto grillesco con Giannino nel film Frankenstein junior?

Secondo te è meglio Persona o Il posto delle fragole?

La vivisezione è un sottinsieme (fortunatamente ristretto) della sperimentazione animale. Si possono effettuare anche sperimentazioni su organo isolato, cellule, o su animale sano (comportamentali, tossicità, ecc). Il termine viene usato spesso in senso dispregiativo, nonostante i test più dolorosi NON includano vivisezione (Tossicità acuta DL50, l'ormai abolito Draize test, irritazione cutanea, ecc). Viceversa gli esperimenti che includono vivisezione spesso vengono eseguiti in anestesia terminale (ovvero in sonno profondo causato da overdose di anestetici) e non prevedono il risveglio, e quindi siano molto più indolori di qualsiasi operazione chirurgica voi abbiate mai affrontato.

Nella mia carriera circa il 10% degli esperimenti che ho visto includevano chirurgia excisiva su animali (che è il nome corretto di ciò che viene comunemente indicato come ""vivisezione"").

&gt;Sulla base di quali dati si può affermare che l'abolizione della legge Merlin e la statalizzazione (monopolio) dello Stato nella vendita di cannabinoidi ripiani i costi dell'IMU?

Sulla tassazione che deriva dalla prostituzione ci sono diversi studi. In breve, l'introito e' da iva e irpef ma e' comunque difficile da stimare perche' rimane un mercato in cui i pagamenti avvengono per lo piu' in contante per motivi di anonimato quindi l'evasione potrebbe essere alta. Ci sono altri modi per recuperare l'evaso (la germania ne conosce alcuni). In genere il gettito stimato e' di 3-5 miliardi l'anno per la prositutzione e 1-6 droghe leggere. In ogni caso, il motivo per cui ho menzionato quei due aspetti nel mio profilo e' perche' voglio far capire che si puo' sposare con coerenza allo stesso tempo argomenti di ""destra"" e di ""sinistra""

&gt;È onesto proporre misure che si sa non saranno mai introdotte?

Chi l'ha detto che non saranno mai introdotte? Tantissimi italiani sono a favore di entrambi: vedi ad esempio referendum sulle droghe leggere del 93,  DdL N. 3034, etc.
E poi scusa che senso ha battersi solo per riforme che sono scontate? non e' la mia idea di politica.

&gt;Cosa ne pensi degli arrivati della politica? 

Cosa sono gli arrivati della politica? 

&gt;Perché Montezemolo vi ha schifati dopo avere aperto al vostro partito? Se non sbaglio ci sono state scintille (sicuramente rientrate per questioni di opportunità) anche con Boldrin che accusava Giannino di essere una primadonna.

Che sia Giannino che Boldrin abbiano un po' della primadonna credo non ci siano dubbi no? L'importante e' che siano primedonne disposte ad ascoltare e a cambiare idea senza vergognarsene. Lo sono entrambi e l'hanno dimostrato mille volte. Ad avercene. Montezemolo ha avuto paura del nostro programma, mi sembra. Come tutti gli altri. FARE corre da solo.

&gt;Perché avete voluto Emma Marcegaglia con voi, della quale si dice abbia pagato tangenti per vedersi assegnati degli appalti e le cui aziende sembrano non rispettare i criteri di sicurezza, causando molte ""morti bianche""? Non eravate voi quelli della legalità e del libero mercato mondato dalle storture del sistema italiano?

Emma Marcegaglia non e' candidata con FARE. 

&gt;Cosa ne pensi delle parole del sobrio Monti che vuole tagliare le cosiddette ali estreme? 

Penso che Monti sia un democristiano traverstito da brava persona.

&gt;È accettabile prendersela col sindacato più grande d'Europa, rifiutandosi di rappresentare anche quelle persone accusandole neanche troppo velatamente di essere la causa della bassa competitività italiana? 

Certo che e' accettabile. Se si hanno argomenti a proprio supporto uno se la puo' prendere anche col Papa e Gesu. Non esistono soggetti intoccabili. Che siano gli argomenti a parlare. 

&gt;È corretto chiamare conservatori chi non vuole vedersi cancellare i diritti acquisiti con lotte negli ultimi decenni? 

Conservatore e' colui che vuole mantenere lo status quo, quindi si', e' corretto. Peraltro, i diritti hanno un costo. Per come la vedo io, la generazione dei miei genitori ha guadagnato diritti costosi che ora non si puo' piu' permettere e che vengono pagati dalla generazione di chi e' nato negli 70/80. 

&gt;È giusto levare tutele ad alcuni per portarli a quelli di chi non ne ha? Credi davvero che un licenziamento più facile significhi maggiore competitività o è solo una scusa per trovare manodopera non specializzata a basso costo facilmente sfruttabile per via del timore di essere licenziati con una scusa? 

Il licenziamento piu' facile non significa automaticamente piu' competitittiva, no. Pero' fa parte di un piano complesso che passa attraverso molte altre riforme - come ad esempio il sussidio di disoccupazione - che, nell'insieme, si traduce in maggiore flessibilita'. Il modello di welfare nord europeo e' un modello che personalmente mi piacerebbe vedere un giorno applicato in italia.

&gt;Ha senso aumentare l'età pensionabile quando ci sono tanti giovani che non hanno un lavoro? 

Nella maggiorparte dei settori, si'. Non devi ragionare nell'ottica in cui un posto di lavoro trattenuto da un vecchio e' un posto di lavoro tolto ad un giovane. In una economia produttiva, il posto si crea per entrambi. L'importante e' creare meccanismi affinche' sia il giovane che il vecchio siano soggetti a eguali diritti e controlli perche' entrambi producano al meglio delle loro rispettive possibilita'. 

&gt;Credi che il precariato sia una tattica per fare versare contributi che non verranno mai resi sotto forma di pensioni per evidente impossibilità ad accumulare sufficienti anni di lavoro con regolare contratto?

Si'. Il precariato come e' strutturato in Italia e' esattamente questo. Un modo per far pagare alla generazione attuale i ""diritti acquisiti"" dei loro genitori. Per usare il tuo stesso termine.

&gt;Come pensa Giannino di fare fronte agli almeno 50 miliardi di euro annui da tagliare per i prossimi 20 anni? 

Sul lungo termine, con la crescita. L'italia non cresce da decenni. Ci siamo dimenticati quanto e' piu' ricco un paese che cresce.

&gt;Vi riterreste soddisfatti se doveste superare il 3%? 

Vedo un sacco di amici su facebook che si interessano di FARE e parlano dei punti del programma (E non per merito mio perche' non ho fatto quasi propaganda). Per me e' gia' una soddisfazione.

&gt;Continuereste a fare politica o morireste nel giro di cinque anni? 

Pochi mesi fa FARE non esisteva. Ora ha un seguito incredibile. Non credo proprio moriremmo nel giro di cinque anni. 

&gt;Lasceresti la ricerca per continuare a fare politica o ti divideresti tra laboratorio e seggio?

Non lascerei la ricerca. L'idea e' di non avere persone che stiano piu' di due mandati.

&gt;Qual è la posizione di FID in merito all'acquisto degli F-35, del TAV, del ponte sullo Stretto, della costruzione del MUOS? 

Oh my. Posso invitarti a cercare il forum? http://fermareildeclino.it/forum 

&gt;Secondo te i Patti Lateranensi sono conciliabili con uno Stato che si dice laico e che crede nel libero mercato? 

Non ho capito la domanda. Fosse per me, i patti lateranensi salterebbero domani mattina. Non capisco che c'entrino col libero mercato pero'.

&gt;FID pensa di rivederli o anche voi trovate rifugio sotto la sottana di Santa Madre Chiesa, se non altro per non inimicarvi le gerarchie ecclesiastiche?

Non siamo fatti di quella pasta.

&gt;Il sobrio Monti ha confessato di avere creduto in Berlusconi nel lontano '94. Siamo sicuri che pure Giannino non abbia preso questo abbaglio, sollevando dubbi sulle sue qualità di osservazione?

Giannino e' stato Berlusconiano della prima ora, non e' certo un segreto. Che importa chi ha votato giannino nel 94? 

&gt;Nel caso si dovesse votare su temi sensibili come questioni di bioetica, FID si schermerebbe dietro il comodo paravento della ""libertà di coscienza"" o darebbe indicazioni chiare su come votare?

Se desse indicazioni chiare su come votare me ne tornerei a casa. comunque, ti rimando al filmato youtube che ho linkato sotto in cui Oscar Giannino spiega perche' FID non detta linee di partito.


&gt;Cosa ne pensi della magnificazione di Oscar Giannino come unico possibile salvatore della patria? O della comunicazione pop dal gusto grillesco con Giannino nel film Frankenstein junior?

Giannino ha molta autoironia.

Do you mean a small minority?  Well, from a recent poll by the ""Jeugdonderzoeksplatform"" (Youth research platform) in northern Belgium, 3,867 youth in large city schools were asked some relevant questions.  The results are discouraging:

50% of young Muslim students want gay marriage repealed.  25% finds violence against homosexuals justified behavior. 45% agreed with the statement that ""Jews instigate wars and blame others"".  Researchers claim that these views are tolerated at home by the parents of these children.

Since these youth represents the immediate future of our ""integrated"" immigrants (they are mostly 3rd and 4th generation now), I do not agree with the statement that they are a very small minority.

Leggevo un report di una ONG (non ricordo quale) che denunciava come la tratta di donne sia molto aumentata con la legalizzazione della prostituzione nei Paesi Bassi. Sebbene creda che strutture sicure dedicate al meretricio siano preferibili alla prostituzione di strada mi chiedo come si potrebbero tutelare le persone che eserciterebbero contro la loro volontà. Questo non significa che ora le cose siano accettabili, ma una semplice sostituzione di termini senza mettere mano a tutto ciò che gli sta intorno mi pare da irresponsabili.

Un altro punto che non ho capito. Tu dici che i candidati di FID non dovrebbero durare più di due mandati, e fin qui tutto bene. Ma se per ventura dovessi finire in politica, sospenderesti la ricerca per il tempo necessario o ti divideresti tra le due attività?

Stavo guardando il forum di FID: è la copia di quello di Grillo. Tanta gente con belle speranze ma senza la consapevolezza (a mio avviso necessaria) che, appunto, sono e resteranno tali. Non credo che i maggiorenti di FID si mettano a leggere le proposte degli utenti del forum. E quindi siamo al punto di prima. 


Il punto dei Patti Lateranensi è questo: volevo suggerire un parallelismo tra gli indebiti aiuti di Stato e questa mortificante pratica della paghetta che distorce i rapporti e li piega al volere del Sovrano nostro vicino.

I'm not trying to convince you otherwise, but how? SlyRatchet just made an effort to remind people how the voting buttons are supposed to be used, according to the Reddiquette, the rules for this site -- it's even linked in this subreddit's sidebar. You've read those comments he got, too. Most seem to like it just the way it is.

Reddit grows, and /r/Europe inevitably grows with it. Most new subscribers will come from the general pool of new Reddit users, and those who sign up are the ones that like the site Reddit represents itself to be by default.  
In a way, there's a similar effect in /r/Europe itself. Had I first come here on one of those days where we're having another racist hatefest, I would have turned away in disgust.

So, there is a strong current dragging us down. To at least retain what's left, we'd have to counter it somehow. But in a way, we're both even making it worse, by getting frustrated or contributing less for other reasons, instead of leading by example and making /r/Europe a community that like-minded folks would want to subscribe to if they stumble upon it somehow.

It's not something ""the government says"". States have laws. There are competent authorities to issue university degrees, competent authorities to deal with medical issues, and so on. The [Office of Internal Affairs](http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;perform=view&amp;id=49&amp;) was established 14 years ago and is the competent authority for that matter, functioning under a specific legal framework. Governments and parties don't matter. It would be the same for any of them. The exact same things are also true for other countries.

&gt; inappropriate it is for that ""authority"" to conduct the investigation

Attempts to discredit a competent authority as a whole because of some past failures seem like attempts to divert from the facts of this investigation, and have little to do with critical thinking. You don't know anything about the people involved in *this* investigation, yet you seem eager to discredit them. What would you do given the spectacular failures of British police forces for 2012 alone, nuke *all* of them?

&gt; If you bring data, it better be accurate. 

They bring enough useful data to the table. If anything, the data reinforce the argument that the police forces have nothing to hide *in this case*. I wrote that even if they used only one camera and all timestamps (create, write, modify) were 100% in agreement, you could still argue they had the ability to alter them. That's why you also rely on other evidence. For example, critics said nothing about the amateur video and eyewitness reports, and they are awfully quiet about the perpetrators' actions.

[**A chi servono i test su animali**](http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio/a-chi-servono-i-test-su-animali/2200058)

di Fulco Pratesi

*Il 92 per cento delle sostanze che superano gli esperimenti sulle cavie nei laboratori non sono efficaci sull'uomo. Queste pratiche sono quindi inutili alla scienza: ma utilissime ai profitti delle case farmaceutiche*

«Il sistema più efficace per restare avvelenati dai funghi è farli assaggiare al cane o al gatto di casa». Così scrivevo in un articolo sull'Espresso del 5 maggio 2006 dedicato alla sperimentazione animale.

Negli ultimi anni numerosi articoli scientifici (su 'Nature' e altre riviste altamente accreditate) hanno confermato ciò, dimostrando come il 'modello animale' sia inaffidabile e non predittivo per l'uomo.

Dal lungo elenco di dichiarazioni di scienziati antivivisezionisti cito solo queste due: «Non siamo ratti da 70 kg! Se non fossero stati effettuati tanti test su animali oggi avremmo probabilmente disponibili modi più efficaci di curare le malattie». (T. Hartung, già Direttore Ecvam al Jrc, Centro Europeo di Ricerca.); «Ogni anno le industrie farmaceutiche sprecano migliaia di milioni di dollari usando come modelli i roditori nella ricerca oncologica» (R. Weinberg del Mit).  

Nell'articolo Fare a meno delle cavie si sostiene che «senza gli animali non vi sarebbe ricerca». Abbondanti dati scientifici dimostrano il contrario. Ad esempio: le revisioni sistematiche del 2006 di Hackam &amp; Redelmeier e del 2003 di Crowley WF Jr, in base alle quali la trasposizione dei risultati all'uomo fallisce quasi nel 70 per cento dei casi (nella ricerca di base i fallimenti sono del 99,996 per cento). Oppure i dati del Fda (organo che negli Usa controlla le sostanze nuove) ripresi da A. Harding su 'The Scientist': il 92 per cento delle sostanze che superano i test su animali non passano la prima delle quattro fasi di sperimentazione sull'uomo.

L'articolo sostiene anche l'insostituibilità dei primati nelle ricerche, citando i vaccini per l'epatite C. Ma recenti studi (come la revisione sistematica di J.Bailey del 2010) e gli articoli del dott. A. Knight (rivista Atla, 2007 e 2008) mettono in discussione la loro utilità. Inoltre, degli 85 vaccini contro l'Aids risultati efficaci e sicuri negli scimpanzè, non uno è risultato utile per l'uomo. 

Gli stessi argomenti valgono per l'articolo C'è un topo in ospedale in cui la ricerca sui roditori (in crisi di credibilità) viene rilanciata con un nuovo 'packaging'. Ma chiamare ""ospedale per topi"" il laboratorio tradizionale e ""malato surrogato"" la cavia non cambia nulla al fatto che la cosiddetta strada maestra per la cura del cancro non può portare (salvo fortuite coincidenze) a risposte utili per l'uomo: diverse ricerche hanno rivelato che l'animale non è predittivo negli studi di cancerogenicità (A.Knight et al. 2006) e che il processo di tumorigenesi è diverso nel topo e nell'uomo (Rangarajan &amp; Weinberg 2003).

Inoltre, di 20 composti noti che non causano il cancro nell'uomo, 19 lo causano nei topi (Ennever et al. 1987). E il 46 per cento delle sostanze che sono cancerogene per i ratti non lo sono per i topi, tanto che Albert Sabin dichiara che «i cancri da laboratorio non hanno nulla a che vedere con quelli naturali dell'uomo».

Ci si chiede allora perché possa sopravvivere ancora questo arcaico metodo di ricerca mentre andrebbero sfruttati ed ampliati i metodi recenti, specifici per la nostra specie, che, sfruttando le nuove conquiste della scienza, offrono enormi potenziali in più nell'affidabilità, nella quantità delle risposte che forniscono, nella rapidità e nella riduzione dei costi. Come fa la ricerca federale dopo la pubblicazione del rapporto 'Toxicity testing in the 21st century', commissionata dal Cnr degli Usa, in cui è annunciato un «cambiamento epocale nella tossicologia con il trasferimento dei test dallo studio dell'animale intero allo studio in vitro della cellula umana».

La risposta la dà il professor Claude Reiss, ex direttore del Cnrs francese: «Il fatto che la stessa sostanza possa essere dichiarata inoffensiva o cancerogena a seconda della specie animale utilizzata, fa della sperimentazione animale lo strumento ideale per commercializzare ogni tipo di prodotto, anche se pericoloso, e per mettere a tacere le vittime che osassero far causa al produttore».

The concerns of the different nations are too varied, and they are too culturally dissimilar.  The EU will only be less effective if it dilutes itself, instead of being a limited bloc whose goals are closely aligned.  Although culturally relatively similar, Aussies face an entirely different set of issues by virtue of their location in the pacific.  They aren't affected by Russia, but care a lot about China and SE Asia. Europe would be taking on a whole new set of problems that have nothing to do with them, and won't deal with effectively.

Even if the EU was willing to accept these countries, many wouldn't want to join.  What benefit would even relatively nearby, culturally similar nations like the US or Canada get from joining?  We're already doing well here, and would like a free trade agreement, but anything more and the costs substantially outweigh the benefits.  Greater North American integration is more likely, but with only 3 major countries to consult on any given issue, bilateral or trilateral agreements already get things done fairly well. There's just not that much impetus for anyone outside to give up sovereignty to Europe.

Hay una película española reciente muy interesante que no conocen muchos aquí pero que a mí me encanta. Va de un profesor de economía que se arruina por ganar un concurso. Hay que verla: *Concursante*.

Y también es muy emocionante **Celda 211**, acerca de un chico que va a entrar a trabajar como guardia en una cárcel y se queda dentro durante un motín: 

http://www.imdb.es/title/tt1242422/?ref_=sr_1

Yo te recomendaría también **Nadie hablará de nosotras cuando hayamos muerto**, de las películas más afamadas de los noventa. Es algo triste, acerca de gente fracasada, y se desarrolla entre la mafia de México y el folclore español:

**Intacto** trata sobre la suerte y las casualidades, está muy bien realizada y es muy curiosa:

Si prefieres la acción y el humor negro **Balada triste de trompeta** te va a gustar, fue de las películas más importantes de hace un par de años, y Tarantino la apadrinó. Trata de dos payasos de un circo decadente a finales del franquismo que se enamoran de una trapecista. Es muy Alex de la Iglesia (director imprescindible):

se venissi eletto non so ancora come faro' a gestire la carriera, la famiglia, e la politica. se dovessi proprio trovarmi in una situazione disperata rinuncerei ad una di queste (probabilmente non la famiglia :)

&gt;Ultima domanda: quali sono gli ultimi tre libri che hai letto?

Ho un bambino di tre anni il che vuol dire che non leggo quanto vorrei, nonostante il kindle e il commute. Comunque gli ultimi tre sono:

Average costs of living as a student in germany are about 700€ a month. According to www.unicum.de.

AFAIK (and I don't know very well) the biggest challenge is to ultimately score a ""unbefristetes Arbeitsverhältnis"" (working contract without fixed expiry date) because then you don't have to go through the unsecure process of prolonging your permission to stay every few years.

true,parigot,null,null,"Priorité à droite is common in Paris, the main place I drive. There is one example literally around the corner from my house. Until the city put a stop light in last year, there were loud, crunching crashes at least once a week, as drivers on an almost invisible road on the right took priority over drivers zooming down the main road. 

When I first moved to France, a bus almost ran me over in a Paris suburb as I was on a four-lane route nationale and a bus zoomed toward me from a one-lane road to the right, on a diagonal so it was hard to see. Of course, being from the U.S., I expected it to stop. It didn't.

I also had a scare my first year when a driver coming from the right and hidden by a badly parked van almost hit my car as I was on a main thoroughfare. 

Here are some more places where foreign drivers will meet priorité à droite:

--the Périphérique
--the A1 to CDG airport (you say it's not legal, but it's so common for entering drivers to take priority that I thought it WAS legal)
--all the large roundabouts in Paris including Etoile/Arc de Triomphe/place Charles-de-Gaulle, place de la Concorde, Trocadéro, etc. (and even when there are signs telling entering drivers they don't have priority, most of them take it anyway, as you can see all day long here)

We have priority to the right in the U.S., too, but it is far, far rarer and applies mainly to four-way intersections in unpeopled areas. In the U.S., almost every intersection has a stop sign on one or the other street. This is definitely not true in France. If you are French, you probably don't understand how dangerous this is to people who are not used to it! It doesn't have to be common to be dangerous. In the U.S.,  a small road never takes priority over a large one, so people who don't know about this are going to have trouble driving here in France.

Even my French driving instructor, when I had to get a French license, complained that priorité à droite as observed in France was dangerous for foreigners!",0,1360620464,null,0,false,0,c8dh1rz,t3_17z8ce,t1_c8dh1rz,t1_c8avw6r,null,1431263488,1,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,1

I'll begin with his first post:

&gt; Norway do not want to become member EU, and never will.

Ok, why?

&gt; We have had referendums two times were people have turned down membership, 

Ok, why?

&gt; and EU is even less tempting now with the Euro-mess.

Ok.
&gt; Iceland may become member, and more ex-Yugoslav states.

Correct, they've applied for ascendancy.

&gt; Turkey will probably not get full membership, but some kind of association. 

Ok, why? Have they not applied for ascendancy like the other countries?

&gt; And there it will end. 

Ok, why?
&gt; They now have more dysfunctional corrupt economies than Germany can pay for.

HUAEHUAEHAUEAHUAEHUAEHUAHEUAHEUAEHUAEHAUEAHUEA. I corrupt u. Pls gib muny.

There is absolutely no value in this wall of text to the discussion at hand. 

Why I ***WOULD*** downvote his second post:

&gt; This has nothing to do with conditions. Norway want freedom.

I can relate to that, although one might say freedom is a condition, but I won't digress by discussing semantics.

&gt; We have been ruled from Copenhagen, Stockholm and Berlin

I can relate, being ruled by an oppressive foreign entity is terrible, and Nazi Germany definitely was not a kind occupier (possible grammar mishap).

&gt; We do not want to be run from Brussels too.

There was no ""logical hyperspace jump"" in this sentence. None at all.

&gt;Besides EU now need someone to pay for South European corruption and economic incompetence.

I completely see where he is coming from. However, Norway still paid for ""South European corruption and economic incompetence"": Directly through the IMF, indirectly through the EFSF (through Norway's state-owned ""oilfund"" investment bank)^huehuehue ^i ^take ^ur ^muny ^huehuehue .

&gt;EU is a mess. But it not our mess.

Of course it isn't. It's not like the EU countries are Norway's main trade partners. 

Now lastly, I actually downvoted your post (sorry) because it violates reddiquette; from your link:

Try submitting later or seek out other communities to submit to. Millions of people use reddit; every story and comment gets at least a few up/downvotes.

This also includes messaging moderators or admins complaining about the votes you did or did not receive, except when you suspect you've been targeted by vote cheating by being massively up/downvoted.

true,Spaturno,"friuli ",,"Ok, ragazzi, andiamo a fare un pò di debunking. 

Prima dici che non siamo ratti di 70 Kg (cosa peraltro abbondantemente falsificabile), e poi mi dici che addirittura l'8% delle sostanze testate si sono dimostrare utili sull'uomo (che è un ottima media, in realtà il valore è molto più basso se contiamo anche i test preliminari in vitro).

La solita domanda: elencami i metodi di ricerca alternativi suddetti. ""Ci sono."" non mi basta. Vorrei protocollo, validazione, e statistica dove dimostrano che sono comparabili a test su animali. Alternativamente, è tutta fuffa politica stile Brambilla. 

Citare singoli articoli degli anni '80, quando chiunque faccia ricerca sa che un articolo da solo non prova un beato cazzo, ed è per questo che esistono meta analisi e studi post pubblicazione, è il tipico errore di chi si aggrappa ad una briciola di verità comoda e confortevole ed esclude qualsiasi altra informazione dal proprio pool di dati.

Quando leggete la frase ""Numerosi scienziati affermano che..."" oppure ""Si sa che.."" senza citare MOLTI articoli peer reviewed, ci sono ottimi indizi che si parli di pseudoscienza.

I cancri che si fanno nei topi non sono ""simili a quelli umani"". Sono PROPRIO quelli umani. Li trasferiamo nei topi dopo averli resi immortali (ci sono moltissime linee cellulari immortalizzate che vengono coltivate in vivo, solo perchè in vitro non creano masse, un esempio le HeLa). 

Il ""cambiamento epocale"" sono, se si va a leggere bene, un'enormità di supercazzole. Cercare di studiare un cancro in vitro è come cercare di produrre un aereo mettendo alcune chiavi inglesi in una scatola e scuotendo.

L'unica cosa che hai detto giusta è che molte ricerche di tossicologia vengono fatte dalle ditte per pararsi il culo dalle cause legali. Ovvio. E non c'è niente di male, è normale che si voglia provare che un farmaco non causa, che so, la focomelia, prima di essere distribuito. Come afferma anche il presidente dell'associazione mondiale talidomicidi, se all'epoca si fosse fatta BENE sperimentazione animale (con studi di teratogenesi che ora sono obbligatori) si sarebbe notato che il talidomide causa focomelia nei feti.

Non è un sistema perfetto? Concordo con te al 100%. Abbiamo un sistema migliore. No. E chi dice il contrario mente, solitamente per interesse politico. 

C'è un fondo che si chiama [crack-it](http://www.crackit.org.uk/) dove danno FRACASSI di soldi a chiunque trovi metodi alternativi. I soldi sono ancora là (e a mio avviso ci resteranno per parecchio).

Il processo di tumorigenesi è sorpredentemente simile (non identico) tra uomo e topo, e le somiglianze sono sufficienti a sviluppare cure e diagnosi, che infatti ora sono usate in clinica.

Falso il fatto che l'animale non sia predittivo. Lo è molto. Non al 100%, ripeto, ma abbastanza, ed è il meglio che si abbia, al momento.

Falso anche il fatto che ci siano 20 composti noti che non causano cancro nell'uomo. 

Sull'ospedale per topi, sono d'accordo, è una cazzata ipocrita.

Ora, per ogni punto potrei snocciolare infinite bibliografie e pubblicazioni, e potrei anche screditare scientificamente gli autori di molti degli articoli citati dagli animalisti, ma potete solo immaginare quanto tempo ci metterei, potrei non fare altro per una settimana, per ogni singolo punto.

Fulco ""Sono ecologista, mi lavo ogni 7 giorni"" Pratesi dovrebbe continuare a proteggere specie in via d'estinzione (cosa che fa benissimo, da politico dei Verdi) e lasciare la scienza agli scienziati, preoccupandosi più che altro della malgestione delle risorse che il WWF succhia senza produrre un cazzo di scientificamente coerente.

I beagle si usano solo alla fine dello sviluppo di un farmaco destinato ad uso umano (o canino), per il fatto che hanno un sistema di biodistribuzione  quasi identico a quello umano, per loro sfortuna. In realtà i farmaci che si testano sui beagle sono già stati trovati non tossici su cellule, tessuti, ratti, topi e cavie, e quindi è davvero MOLTO raro che causino sorprese letali. Son stato in alcuni allevamenti (tra cui quello Harlan) e gli animali sono addestrati a prendere il test come un gioco. Solitamente si riduce ad un'iniezione e a dei prelievi di sangue ogni tot tempo, per vedere se il farmaco persiste / è distribuito nel corpo del cane (e quindi dell'uomo) come previsto nelle specie ""inferiori"" di roditori. Non è tanto la reazione quindi, che ormai in quella fase deve essere arcinota, quando la velocità a cui questa accade.

Per la cronaca un beagle da sperimentazione costa circa 3-5000 euro, quindi capirete bene come nessuno vuole giocarsene uno testando alla cazzo.

La procedura per lo sviluppo di un farmaco solitamente è questa. Si parte da, diciamo, 10.000 principi attivi. Con studi in vitro, e su simulazione (farmacogenomica) se ne scremano circa 9500. Dei 500 selezionati come quelli teoricamente attivi, si testano su colture cellulari di cellule immortalizzate per verificarne efficacia e tossicità. I 10 che si dimostrano efficaci e non tossici su cellule vengono testati su un piccolo campione di topi (circa 6 animali per test). Le 2-3 sostanze che non danno effetti collaterali inaccettabili iniziano il trial preclinico. Devono essere testate quindi su una seconda specie di roditori (tipo la cavia) per evitare che ci siano quei famosi problemi ""fa male all'uomo ma non al topo"" (es. talidomide). Se si dimostrano efficaci e non tossici, non teratogenici, non cancerogeni e non pirogeni vengono quindi inviati alla fase successiva (solitamente ne resta uno, il migliore), che passa ai cani e in rari casi alle scimmie (ma solitamente non è richiesto) per gli studi di farmacocinetica e farmacodinamica. Qualora non ci fossero problemi di sorta si passa alla sperimentazione umana (trial clinico di fase II) in cui pochi volontari lo provano e vengono seguiti a lungo. Se non ci sono effetti collaterali inaccettabili si passa a test su campioni più larghi (fase III) e infine il principio viene commercializzato. A seguito della commercializzazione c'è la fase IV, dove l'agenzia del farmaco raccoglie per anni dati per evidenziare problemi a lungo termine non rilevabili altrimenti.

La ricerca di base invece è diversa. Per quella si creano dei modelli animali di patologia, ovvero animali che replicano UN ASPETTO di una patologia, e si vede se è possibile individuarne la causa e rimediare al problema. Si individua una pathway, ovvero una sequenza di reazioni chimiche a livello cellulare che causa un problema se ""guasta"", e si cerca di sistemare la cosa.

true,DaphneDK,FARO,Faroe Islands,"No you are mistaken. On the contrary Russia and Scandinavia always had close relations also on the ruling elite side. The first Russian state was even, according to some historians, originally founded by the Nordic Vikings ([Rurik]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rurik)), and the close relations between the Danish royal house and the Russian lasted for many centuries afterwards. Many Danish kings have been called Vladimir (Valdemar in Danish) starting with [Valdemar the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdemar_I_of_Denmark) - himself son of the Russian princess [Ingeborg of Kiev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingeborg_of_Kiev), and he was married to Sophia of Minsk. Many other Russians in there as well. And Danish royals in Russian families; including [Princess Dagmar of Denmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)) – the last Empress of Russia. I believe there are also similar connections to other the Swedish royal house, and the royal houses of other European nations (Catherine the Great).

But also with the common people were associations with Russia common from an early age. Several of the oldest Scandinavian histories are about Viking trade to and from Russia, and there were the Viking guards in Byzantine which came from or travelled through Russia. And then there is Russian involvement in the Great Northern Wars, the Napoleon wars, the Crimean Wars, WW-I, The Winter War, WW-II, the Cold War, etc.

I’d say Scandinavia has more historic ties to Russia than to for instance to some countries in Southern Europe.

For the past two years, financial analysts and economists were warning about the impending Greek withdrawl from the Euro, as if it were so easy. They failed to understand that the Euro and the European Union are not just economic endeavors. They are political ones as well. Anyone familiar with the Euro knew full well that it was a poorly designed currency from the start, but it was necessary in order to push integration further. Markets began to learn that economic interests were only one of countless factors at play in the Euro crisis. They have now seemed to learn that the political will for a Greek exit never existed in the first place.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt;The draft EU budget that has been adopted is, dare we say it, impoverished. The text confirms the lack of economic ambition and vision of the bloc at a time when we find ourselves in direct competition with the continental countries such as the United States, China and India.

&gt;**Those countries pursue strategies that aim for excellence in certain sectors and that promote their champions, springboarding off their vast domestic markets to conquer the world.** The draft EU budget does exactly the opposite: the future projects that could serve as a support for a European industrial strategy have been massacred. They represent just a fraction of the direct subsidies paid into agriculture and a little over a tenth of the total budget.

I can already tell at this point that this author is rather fond of exageration.


&gt;The crisis, the rapid transformation of the world economy and the extraordinary evolution of global power relations should have inspired a surge in Europe: **a union against an America that is getting back on its feet,**

What the fuck?!? Why in the hell would Europe be against an America that is getting back on its feet? I'm pretty sure there is a trade imbalance between the US and Europe in favor of Europe, and any export market that is consuming more of your goods when domestic demand is weakening should be welcomed. And since when is Europe a union that is *against* America? 

&gt;We must draw political lessons from this mess. **The budget debate has been taken hostage by one country, the United Kingdom, which may not even be part of the union tomorrow. David Cameron came to sabotage the general European interest, and he succeeded.  Duly noted.** In this case, though, let’s follow this through to its logical conclusion: if the strategic thinking is not done at the eurozone level, the bloc will be doomed to impotence.

Who the hell is this Nicolas Barré guy? He sounds like a fear mongering, sensationalizing son of a bitch to me. Whoever he is, he is desperately trying to make it seem like the rest of the world has resolved all of its issues, and his forging the path to a prosperous future while Europe alone is struggling with internal debates and a shakey economy. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that these issues are currently being played out in much of the rest of world as well. This guy must simply be trying to make a name for himself by stoking the flames of peoples emotions. Fuck Nicolas Barré.

A big aspect is regional government corruption and the fact that the police was on to them and had planted spies. 

The education minister beeing stripped of the PhD is actually even bigger, because you need to see it in the context of various politicians in the last years to have been accused and convicted of **plagiarism**, the most sensational case (that even sparked a few new proverbs and words) was that of zu Guttenberg, the former minister of defense. A highly manipulative, quite cheesy guy that handled the whole thing as bad as possible. He and the others play a big role in the disappointment and disillusion with politicians.

Several Large building sites that involve government money are the laughing stock of the nation ( **Elb Philharmonie, Flughafen Berlin, S21**) due to mismangement. The youngest of them, Stuttgart 21 has even had a strong impact on politics. It caused a shift in the regional government when the conservatives who held control over this federal state over 47 years were supplanted by a coalition of the green and the social party.

The transition to **clean energy** topic is huge. Fukushima caused a veritable earthquake over here because only six months before the incident the then rather new government stated to cling to nuclear energy and selling it as the only option, picturing horror scenarios of big power outages since without the nuclear plants germany couldn't be supported with electricity sufficiently and blah blah blah. Next thing you know is the government did a very spectacular 180°.

Germany as part of the **European Union** is struggling like all members to get this giant project in it's infancy to run smoother. Currently Europe (and Germany beeing one of the wealthier members) is constantly running into all sorts of problems they are faced with for the very first time (like not beeing able to deacrease the value of it's currency to navigate through a financial crisis). 

Currently it's the season of [Fasching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasching)/ Karneval / [Fasnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swabian%E2%80%93Alemannic_Fastnacht), also called **the fifth season**, that plays a big role in some areas, where you can typically say that a city/area with a strong focus on it has a more catholic heritage. Lot's of drinking, pretty costumes ranging from very traditional to modern and creative, varies strongly from one region to the other.

true,Spaturno,"friuli ",,"1) ho iniziato con una laurea in scienze naturali, specializzazione in conservazione della natura e delle sue risorse. Ho provato per qualche tempo ad entrare in musei come conservatore, ma siamo in Italia. Per la tesi ho scelto anatomia comparata, e mi sono ritrovato a studiare le differenze nel sistema nervoso tra umani depressi, ansiosi e sani, e di come alcune malattie autoimmuni, come la celiachia, attaccassero il sistema nervoso generando tali condizioni emotive. L'unico modo ovviamente era quello di trovare un modello animale di autoimmunità neurologica. Son stato in tesi due anni (sì, era l'epoca in cui le tesi erano ancora dei progetti sensati) e ci ho pure pubblicato un Plos One come secondo nome. Nel frattempo la mia tutor faceva ricerca su un altro ramo, che aveva bisogno di cervelli di ratto. Mandava quindi me a fare gli espianti su animale morto (soppresso con CO2, indolore). Ho avuto modo di sviluppare un bel pò di skill in quei due anni. Dopo la tesi sono riuscito a lavorare per sei mesi in un museo come anatomista, e poi un anno in una ditta che si occupa di restauro di fossili di dinosauri. Mi hanno poi chiamato come tecnico dall'università come tecnico, e poi mi sono specializzato nel settore, finendo nel settore privato.

Tornassi indietro, farei lo stesso percorso? Probabilmente no. Ma visto che lo faccio, mi piace farlo bene.

2) Assolutamente sì, anche se non approvo le politiche di conservazione ambientale attuale attuate in Italia. Poche forze hanno sia le energie sia le competenze per gestire il poco ambiente naturale che resta. Quello marino è sovrasfruttato e idee innovative come fish nurseries vengono poco incentivate. Il sistema parchi è ormai politicizzato e inefficiente, e molti degli interventi hanno mire locali, e non globali come servirebbe. Tuttavia il problema è culturale, in Italia, più che economico. Non c'è vera attenzione all'ambiente perchè, dopotutto, non frega a nessuno.

3) Centrosinistra, anche se con l'amaro in bocca per l'inutilità di Bersani. Ritengo Grillo un pericoloso antiscientista, anche se i suoi sottoposti non mi dispiacciono. Per quanto l'ambiente in cui lavoro sia vergognosamente colluso con la destra, odio il voto di scambio e mi rifiuto di sottopormici, avendo una professionalità che me lo consente.

4) Decisamente un'anatra grande come un cavallo: la percezione del dolore non è proporzionale alle dimensioni, quindi, se per assurdo un esperimento fosse altrettanto significativo con un solo animale sacrificato, la priorità si assegna per minor numero di animali utilizzati (e quindi minor sofferenza causata).

true,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt;A part une détestation par principe de l'impot je n'y vois pas grand chose.

Je ne vois pas de détestation par principe de l'impôt, mais deux critiques majeures du fonctionnement de la France : 

1. nos politiques sont des fonctionnaires qui n'ont aucune idée du monde de l'entreprise, en particulier de la concurrence internationale

Si tous les pays taxent à 80%, c'est très bien. Mais dès qu'un pays baisse ses taxes (phénomène général des 30 dernières années), le système est déréglé. Après, on se pose les mauvaises questions :  A-t-on un problème de répartition de richesses ou de création de richesses ? Est-ce que ce qui est insupportable c'est la richesse ou la pauvreté ?

2\. *Le Français a un côté jaloux.* C'est probablement lié à notre héritage catholique, et assez bien expliqué par [Attali](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xro72_juifs-argent-jacques-attali_news#.URoU-KV2SW8) (à 6'15).

&gt;la France ne l'as pas empéché d'entreprendre, ni de réussir

Bien sûr, il profite du système actuel et des avantages de la France, comme toi (si tu as la chance d'habiter en France) et moi. Mais à mon avis, il fait partie de ceux qui vont dans la bonne direction, car son argent sert à quelque chose. Est-ce vraiment à cause des 40 patrons du CAC si on a 10% de chômage ?

Ensuite, Essilor a aussi réussi grâce aux exportations, mais je ne suis pas sûr que si Essilor était une entreprise allemande, elle n'aurait pas *mieux* réussi.

Par ailleurs :
&gt;Reste la question qu'il n'aborde pas : -Quelle est la finalité de son désir d'entreprendre.

Je ne sais pas vraiment si c'est une bonne question, tout dépend des priorités : si la priorité, c'est de réduire la pauvreté et le chômage, alors peu importent les motivations pour créer des entreprises.

De plus, il parle de ce que lui fait avec son argent : tout remettre dans sa boite (il en est vraiment amoureux). Après, il évoque un débat un peu différent :
&gt; Le problème n'est pas ce qu'on gagne, c'est ce qu'on en fait.

Mon avis, c'est que les patrons et entrepreneurs ne sont pas néfastes. Par contre, les rentiers et les spéculateurs sont des parasites. En France, on a plutôt tendance à taper sur les riches en général, sans distinguer ceux que j'appelle *parasites* des autres.

Il a bien évidemment tort quand il dit qu'on empêche d'entreprendre, mais dans une époque mondialisée, si j'ai une idée pour créer une boite, je ne vois pas pourquoi je la créerais en France plutôt que dans un autre pays (enfin si : par chauvinisme mal placé et patriotisme débile).",0,1360667318,null,0,false,0,c8dsb3t,t3_1890pg,t1_c8dsb3t,t1_c8dm1fm,null,1431268920,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; We have Finland

Finland here. I'll provide some points and opinions, others may disagree.

You can quite easily model Finland just by voting with others, and generally not opting out of much anything, and not threatening with a veto. Finland rarely raises a stink in EU negotiations or decisions. One rare example happened in 2012 when Finland demanded a collateral for loan garantees for Greece etc. and eventually got those (well, sort of).

Generally (but not always) Finland is with the so called ""Northern Block"". It's an unofficial term to describe countries in contrast of ""Southern Block"", and covers usually countries like Germany, Netherlands, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, UK etc. Finland is also a Nordic country. Usually you can seek potential block-allies among those two groups. Remember: you're a small country, you will need block-allies in various issues.

Be ready to compromise in negotiations. Choose one or max two vital issues which you need to keep, and then some others where you're willing to compromise. Always actively seek partners and block-allies: I'll support your issue if you support mine, I'll compromise here if you compromise there.

And when in doubt, go with Germany ;)


Some Finnish issues and stances:

Neutrality.  
Like Ireland, Sweden and Austria Finland wants to keep it's neutrality or at least appearance of it. So no NATO membership, Western European Union (obsolete) membership or [common EU defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy) for Finland.  
Though at the same time Finland actually is a NATO partner in peace and in [NATO Response Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Response_Force), and a member of  [European Union Battlegroups](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=European_Union_Battlegroups&amp;amp;redirect=no). But Finland wants to be neutral. It's all a bit confusing, see the chart here: [File:European defence integration.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/European_defence_integration.svg)  
Advice: In negotiations co-operate with Ireland, Sweden and Austria and try to form blocks with them. You might need to opt out from some defence policies, but be very careful not to be left out of everything - despite being neutral you do not want to be left alone (consult a map). So use the leverage of the block to propose and negotiate optional (more neutral in appearance) ways of doing defence partnerships.


Democracy and transparency.  
As a Nordic country Finland advocates democracy, transparency and openness in government and decision making. Sometimes this is in contrast to some other members. Sweden and Denmark are always good potential allies here, but not by all means the only ones.


Farming and regional funding.  
As a northern country Finland has it's peculiarities with agriculture. Farming in Finland is hard compared to southern countries, yet there are quite a few farmers in Finland. In membership negotiations Finland got a reasonable deal: Finland receives funding from Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) and also regional development funding for Eastern and Northern Finland from Cohesion Funds.  
Those two are very important, getting smaller, and they are yours *alone* to defend. Operative word being alone. So whatever you do never put these on line in negotiations and be ready to compromise everywhere else. (For example: unlike Denmark and Sweden in recent budget negotiations Finland did not go for a rebate because it had to defend those two. As a result Finland's net contribution increased, but those two were reduced only slightly.)


EU Integration.  
Finland supports further integration. 


Eurozone.  
Finland is a member of EMU and has €. Lotsa complex interesting issues there with the bailouts, fiscal union, [European Stability Mechanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Stability_Mechanism) and all. An example of Finnish stance: [Eurozone fiscal union first, more bailout funds later, Finland says](http://news.monstersandcritics.com/business/news/article_1687735.php/Eurozone-fiscal-union-first-more-bailout-funds-later-Finland-says)


Popular support.  
In Finland both EU and € have majority popular support. Only one party Perussuomalaiset (""true finns"") has vocal anti-EU stance. They're in opposition.


Some notable things that Finland has opposed in the past.  
2011 Finland and Netherlands opposed Romania and Bulgaria joining [the Schengen Area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area#Prospective_members).  
Unsourced and IIRC: Over a decade ago Finland at first opposed Eurozone membership of Greece, because numbers did look kinda funny, but my memory may fail me here.

Public schools aren't horrible but can leave much to be desired, but that largely depends on the neighborhood. Most Concertadas and Private schools are connected to a church or other Catholic institution but in reality are very light on the religion part and offer more extra-curricular activities and higher quality classes. Where you live and are registered (empadronado) will determine which public and semi-public schools your children may attend. Private/International schools cost considerably more than other schools but are the only one's that offer a sizeable portion of the curriculum in English (or French/German/etc). 
As far as the language goes, English is taught but poorly in most schools and in Barcelona at least half of the classes, if not more, will be taught in Catalan, not Spanish at most public/concertada schools (and private one's too). Spanish has almost become a secondary language in Catalonian schools. Valencia is all Spanish I think (I'm not sure how much Valenciano in incorporated into public education).

2. As far as the area to live in goes, most nice neighborhoods are great for kids in Spain, public space is plentiful and well-used and sage. As far as Barcelona goes, I would suggest the nieghborhoods of Gracia (international and hip) or Sant Gervasi (clean and upscale) as they are still close to the center but not in the downtown crush. In my opinion if you don't close enough to the center, you might as well move to a suburb where you can have a house/garage. Sant Cugat is a nice little town outside of Barcelona and well connected, it's not cheap but that's because there are plenty of reasons to live there. I'm now living in Sabadell which is not as charming as Sant Cugat, but it's where I'm working and it also seems to be a great place for kids (although it can get a bit dull for adults).

Blame the government for restricting access and holding a monopoly there in the first place.

Canalised water is just like the railroads, the only reason those are inefficient monopolies today was because the state stepped in, regulated everything and eventually nationalised.

&gt;It's basically not possible to develop a real market, so there will not be any real competition ever, only an oligopoly, and hence there will be inflated prices and a decline in quality.

Same thing if the state manages it, the only difference is that the costs are hidden for you, they're paid also through taxes.

&gt;Free markets are good and I am always defending them. But before jumping on a privatization train, ask yourself if there is a chance for a free market to actually develop. 

And before jumping on a nationalisation train, ask yourself if there is a chance that society will actually benefit from this.

Because it seems to me a lot of people here are expect a free lunch by the government, that they won't all pay just the same or even more.

&gt;Same goes for health care, no free market will ever work, because there is no transparency. The US has the freest of all health care markets and prices usually above 250% of the prices elsewhere.

I wonder how much of their taxes go to healthcare as opposed to ours. Though that's an whole other discussion, I'm never going to support the US's stance towards healthcare because of how their government says they act in favour of a free market and competition but actually just helps the health providers that already exist against the customers and new competition, it's basically a corporatism system, socialism upside down, the complete opposite of a free market.",0,1360672925,null,0,false,0,c8dsy0f,t3_18dbd6,t1_c8dsy0f,t1_c8dst0k,null,1431269223,-10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-10

No, the tap water market is inflexible because of inert properties of the product. You would actually need to heavily regulate to make it into a functioning market, but that would be even more expensive than just letting local governments run the show.

&gt; Canalised water is just like the railroads

Exactly. Railroad privatization has turned out to be a disaster everywhere it was tried. In Germany, they wanted to privatize railroad for the past 20 years and haven't been able to figure out a way to do it without destroying it.

&gt; regulated everything and eventually nationalised

As I said, the main problems is the tendency to generalization. Water is better run publicly. Most other things are better run privately. Don't generalize. Stay pragmatic.

&gt; Same thing if the state manages it,

Run it by local governments. If they fuck up, the mayor gets kicked out in the next elections and the local managers get heat from their neighbors.

&gt; costs are hidden for you, they're paid also through taxes.

The local water companies should be normal companies with public books, thy should just be owned by local governments.

&gt; And before jumping on a nationalisation train, ask yourself if there is a chance that society will actually benefit from this

That is precisely what I am asking. But you should also asking yourself this question.

&gt; I wonder how much of their taxes go to healthcare as opposed to ours.

In the US: quite a bit, its called ""MedicAid"" and ""MediCare"". In Germany: None. At less than half the cost per patient for better treatment. The OECD published a comparative study about this about a year ago. UK, France, Germany with public health care (but different models of implementation) are all well above the US.

&gt; because of how their government says they act in favour of a free market and competition but actually just helps the health providers

I had to prove 6 months of Spanish banking history to get my residencia. Once I gave them that, they wanted an additional 6 months of Spanish Banking history. Impossible to do if you're on a 3 month tourist visa. 

My best advice is to get your NIE as soon as possible, get a bank account ASAP, get a SIM card ASAP.  Movistar would not allow me to make long distance calls until I had 3 months of history with them regardless of how much money I put down on account. 

Get registered for Taxes ASAP. You cannot receive any FedEx, DHL etc without being registered for taxes. It makes getting documents sent around the world painfully slow without it. Expect to pay 20% duty on the value of said courier packages. Warn your family back home about this if they send a care package. 

It is much easier if you have a local help you in these manners. I found that the rules were not as strict if I had my local friend help as an interpreter. Initially I had a girl helping me who had a Spanish Language degree from a respectable North American university, but she had a foreign accent. It's not the same. A local accent can make things happen easier. 

The Spanish government is not set up to be efficient. Be patient. Have all your ducks in a row and expect failure at every step. Expect to wait weeks, and months for something than can be done in an afternoon in North America. Losing my bank card was a 6 week ordeal, vs 5 min back home. 

The economy in Spain is at its worst in 100 years, people are wary to take risks. I had to pay 12 months rent up front for my house. The laws in place make it very easy for people to squat in a home and avoid paying rent. I had to come up with €29,000 cash and still my landlord won't set up a month to month billing for next year. 

It is one of the most beautiful places in the world, but I've never been more stressed getting my life set up here. My family loves it, and we plan on staying a while. But life comes down to expectations. If you expect to be legally settled in a month, you're gonna have a bad time. 

We have our kids in an English school, which is very popular with the locals vs an International School for expats. We wanted our children to experience the Spanish culture, but not be completely out of their element. They speak English on the classroom and Spanish on the playground. We pay €4500 per kid per year, which is average for private/expat schools. There are private local schools which are around €2000 a year and public schools which are covered by your taxes.

How so? I've never heard of a situation where goods and services were actually cheaper when provided by the government, just because it might be cheaper for the consumer it doesn't mean it will be cheaper for society.

&gt;Exactly. Railroad privatization has turned out to be a disaster everywhere it was tried.

Quite the opposite, railroads were first privately owned and only then nationalised, they were much better managed and competitive back then till the state intervened and restricted the business.

&gt;In Germany, they wanted to privatize railroad for the past 20 years and haven't been able to figure out a way to do it without destroying it.

You might be right but for the wrong reasons. Railroads today are much more unprofitable, specially in Germany with the Autobahn.

&gt;Water is better run publicly.

How?

&gt;Run it by local governments. If they fuck up, the mayor gets kicked out in the next elections and the local managers get heat from their neighbors.

Oh, that does sound more appealing, here it is pretty much all done from some office in Lisbon. Still, between having a limited choice with regards to the mayor or having a limited choice about the supplier, I still believe it would be best for each and every customer to choose for themselves.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;You seem unable to differentiate between soviet communism and social planning.

Soviet? I didn't even mentioned the USSR!

Anyway, there's no such thing as ""good socialism"" and ""bad socialism"", all socialism is done with good intentions, they all want to provide a better life for its citizens, the problem arises when the people in charge choose for (and sometimes even against) the people they sent out to represent and protect.

In this case, it's hardly meaningful, not at all comparable to the worst examples of communism, but the main idea is there - to do good by taking away with force, to control and regulate and legislate with the purpose of giving everybody water.

Don't get me wrong, the idea is good, the means to achieve it is what's awful, if making a law saying ""everybody should have access to water"" gave everybody water, sure, we should do that and we should even go further, we should make laws saying ""everybody should be wealthy and have plenty, humans are meant to live in prosperity and happiness, not in misery and misfortune"".. the problem is, that has never ever worked, the results of policies like that have always ended in failure and let the people in those societies worse off.

&gt;When you provide your populace with security and the means to achieve goals more easily you're making a huge investment in your own country. I.E. You're more willing to buy a new car if you're not worried about losing your life's savings as a result of some medical emergency. 

I know, but how is this relevant? You're talking about car or health insurances, why?

&gt;Ensuring your populace is healthy and has free access to water (it's not just for drinking, it's also extremely important for sanitation) is also one way to promote this kind of safety.

The free market already ensures that. You could not tax it or perhaps even subsidise if it was really necessary.. making it a public good achieves none of that safety you're mentioning.

&gt; I'm not saying I'm for the privatisation of water, but it's worth considering that food is a human right, yet the state has no mandate to feed is. That's left to private companies because they're better at delivering to us what we want despite it being immensely important that we eat. This seems to explicitly state that providing water should be the job of the state The EU legislation should require governments to ensure and to provide all citizens Whilst, personally, I think it should I don't think it's the EU's job to tell all its states they should nationalise the water industry. If a state wants to have privatised water industry so be it. If there's a piece of EU legislation which goes more in the direction of making sure standards of water are kept high across the EU as apposed to making national governments provide water, I'd be more willing to sign.

La situazione ereditata da Ratzinger era agghiacciante. Vent'anni di non governo e l'ultimo periodo col pover'uomo usato tipo Andropov dalla curia per garantirsi un paravento dietro il quale farsi i cazzi propri hanno consegnato a Benedetto XVI una situazione di guerra per bande che al confronto nella buona vecchia Dc erano delle mammolette.

Il che ci sta, perché se sei un professore di teologia puoi fare tutti gli sforzi di questo mondo per fare il politico, ma fatalmente qualcosa che non ti viene ci sarà sempre. Alla fine, l'istinto di conservazione della struttura ha avuto la meglio sul tentativo generoso ma velleitario di Ratzinger di prendere in mano la situazione.

Well I do support the voucher system for education and the state paying for the healthcare in private hospitals, that way both healthcare and education would be available to all despite the resources of the individual in a system which would then be for the most part privately owned.

&gt;All things that require an extremely expensive network need to be either state owned or heavily regulated to guarantee unbundled access.

I'm yet to see an example of a state owned business that turned out better than that same business privately owned so I don't know.

&gt;I would rather they were mandatorily state owned so there's no regulator for the network owner to influence since the network owner would be the regulator itself. 

I don't understand what you mean by this.. are you suggesting a state monopoly?

&gt;There are tons of examples of what happens when this is not the case (no heavy regulation or state ownership). The most recent one being the sorry state of internet broadband in the US. 

What do you mean?

&gt;There are limits to what the free market is good at solving efficiently, water seems to me to be dangerously close to all of them if not past them.

Yes, I'm fully aware that a market may work to the benefit of all parties when there's a situation that resembles a monopoly or an oligopoly, however the point I'm raising and that some people seem to forget is that state ownership doesn't solve these problems, it just hides them with taxes, heck, you can even be paying nothing at all for the water you consume but be paying twice as much as you'd otherwise pay in a privately owned system just in taxes that the state will then spend for you in the water company.

Tentando di essere sintetico:

Ritengo che lo scopo delle religioni di imporre regole igieniche o di convivenza civile sia superato da tempo. La gente ora è mediamente istruita (rispetto al medioevo, per esempio) da sapere che certe cose sono sbagliate/ingiuste senza avere lo spauracchio della punizione divina. Punizione, tra l'altro, facilmente evitabile chiedendo scusa *dopo*.

Le religioni, in particolare le più diffuse, promuovono attivamente l'ignoranza (perché studiare quando tutte le risposte vengono da [inserire nome del libro sacro]?), ostacolano la ricerca scientifica per supposti motivi etici (vedi staminali e altro), si arrogano il diritto di decidere per **tutti** cosa è giusto e cosa no, calpestando i diritti di chi non vuole avere nulla a che fare con loro (lgbt, malati terminali, etc..).

Non mi esprimo per le religioni *straniere*, ma quello che si vede qui in Italia dimostra semplicemente che la chiesa cattolica non sia altro che un centro di potere, con giochi a livelli che neppure riesco ad immaginare. Non credo che il papa si sia dimesso ""perché stanco e provato"".

Infine ritengo che non esistano sufficienti prove che supportino l'esistenza di qualunque divinità, semmai il contrario. Con questo, sia chiaro, non dico ""Io credo che non esista alcun dio"", bensì ""Io non credo che esista alcun dio"".

They are very expensive infrastructures and once one is in place no one is going to build another one. So it falls to the state to either build the network and give equal access to all the participants or force the incumbent to lease the network for a fair (usually at cost) price so there can be competition and the market actually works.  
  
Of course that when it comes to water, the network is not the only problem, there are also limited sources of it, so whoever controls them has a monopoly.

If you take the ICE (German high-speed train), you'll get there in something like 6 - 8 hours, depending what time you leave (you'll have to change, and not every section is on the high-speed train - but basically you'll go via ICE to Hamburg, which is most of the journey. Then regional trains and/or bus gets you the rest of the way). You can look at your options on [db.de](http://db.de), there's an english version of the site so you should be able to figure it out fine.

If you do want to take the train, you'd be wise to book in advance. Ticket prices are much lower than what you'll pay if you just turn up on the day. I don't know if there are any complications booking from the US (it was perfectly straightforward when I booked online a few years ago while I was still living in the UK, but maybe being EU makes things easier).

You might also consider [mitfahren](http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/), which is kinda like… preorganised hitch-hiking, or something (that site's not the only one, but afaik it's the biggest).

true,e1821e,GREE,Greece,"&gt; Greece alone wants to enjoy the monopoly on the name ""Macedonia""

You are mistaken.

Let me try another approach.

A couple of decades ago, there were 2m Greek Macedonians living in Macedonia, Greece, and 1m Yugoslav Macedonians living in what was called [Vardard Banovina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vardar_Banovina) and then [Socialist Republic of Macedonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Macedonia), a federal unit within Yugoslavia. There was a clear distinction. There was no real debate about their Slavic heritage, their leaders did not bow before maps of ""United Macedonia"" etc. These things had been toned down significantly following the wars of the past.

Now, there are 1.2m people wishing to identify as Macedonians and only as Macedonians, in a country wishing to use the common name Macedonia and only that. However, this country occupies roughly a third of the area of Macedonia, which is now a wider geographic region. These people constitute one quarter of the people living in that region. Greek Macedonians are the biggest group of this area (half of its total population), and the Greek region of Macedonia occupies half of the region's area. The Greek part of the region also includes the core territories of the ancient kingdom which gave the name to the wider region, and which is perceived as a [Hellenic](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hellenic) kingdom by the vast majority of academics (for a brief summary of the history of the region, supported by hundreds of distinguished specialists [see here](http://macedonia-evidence.org/obama-letter.html)).

Greece and many other countries support that these people and their country should identify as a part, and not as a whole. They do have the right of self-identification, but their choice should reflect the realities of the region, and not lead to conflicts that might scale unexpectedly in the future. Simply put, they are not ""the"" Macedonians, they are ""some"" Macedonians"". There are Greek Macedonians, Albanian Macedonians, Bulgarian Macedonians, Serbian Macedonians, and others.

&gt; No one body has a monopoly on the name.

Exactly. This is the reason to accept the proposal I've explained above. ""Part of"" Macedonia and ""some Macedonians"".",0,1360692499,null,0,false,0,c8dxog6,t3_18bcw3,t1_c8dxog6,t1_c8drsjk,null,1435630332,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
true,mcxo2,null,null,"hai colto molti punti pienamente condivisibili... Wojtyla non ha di certo colpe, anche perché bisogna vedere in quel momento i giochi di palazzo che vi erano... c'è da pensare, all'inizio della malattia di Wojtyla l'allora Ratzinger ed altri presero in considerazione l'abdicazione e la proposero senza successo, cosa sarebbe successo... ma forse doveva andare così!
l'unica nota stonata in Wojtyla fu quando mandò Ratzinger a trattare i casi di pedofilia! Ratzinger voleva da subito il pugno duro ed arrivò al contrasto con l'allora Papa minacciando le dimissioni dall'incarico, ma alla fine dovette obbedire e accettare quel ruolo che poco gli piaceva di esser il pacere... fra le varie cose che fece Ratzinger nel suo pontificato nei confronti della pedofilia è quello di aver tolto la prescrizione... adesso anche il resto dei stati del mondo dovrebbero farlo, anche perché questo crimine statisticamente non viene consumato dai soli preti cattolici, che sono nell'ordine del 2-3% compresi però tutte le religioni, ma il nocciolo più grosso viene dalla famiglia stessa dei bimbi!
Ratzinger ha cercato di sistemare lo IOR, ma la battaglia era troppa! aveva messo un suo uomo di fiducia che ha dovuto dimettersi per il semplice motivo che non riusciva a far nulla, ed anche se denunciò il fatto nulla accadde... in fatti da 8 mesi lo IOR non ha nessuna giuda proprio perché il Papa non riesce a trovar metodo di sfondamento in quella struttura che di cristiano ha ben poco, anche se serve per la sopravvivenza non solo della Chiesa ma delle opere missionarie che sono in tutto il mondo!
teologicamente nel confronto delle altre religioni Ratzinger era il Papa giusto al momento giusto... e non parlo solo all'esterno ma nella cristianità stessa! se gli ortodossi sono passati dal veder ""satana vestito di bianco"" (così chiamavano Wojtyla), a ""fratello"" (Ratzinger) beh... bene da un punto di vista ecumenico, ma questa svolta era costretta proprio dalla profondità teologica che questo piccolo uomo divenuto Vicario di Cristo aveva!
forse è giusto così... finché ha ancora qualche forza ed anche dimissionario con un minimo di potere può ancora rimettere la Chiesa nella giusta via, anche se me ne spiace veramente... con lui sapevo che anche se sarebbe stato difficile combattere i mali interni della Chiesa, almeno avevo una persona che non avevo dubbi sul suo intento!
avvolte sento che viene visto tradizionalista per la questione del latino... allora... la Messa non è proselitismo... la Parola viene portata avanti nella lingua che tutti possano capire, ma la Messa è del credente e serve ad esso... il credente ha l'incarico anche d'impegnarsi (comunque, se lo vuole.... mica è costretto... anzi, la Messa in latino è speciale e non la norma) nel segno della cattolicità (universalità vista anche come insieme dei credenti)... a che serve la Messa in latino? un piccolo esempio che mi sento di dire è questo ""fra vari viaggi mi son trovato anche in terre lontane dove la lingua era un grosso impedimento, il riuscire ad entrare in una chiesa e pregare in un'unica lingua ha tolto molta della diffidenza che si avvertiva entrando e facendo scena muta o parlando una lingua che nessuno comprendeva""... la Messa è per i credenti e per Dio! 
aneddoto: quando c'era Wojtyla un gruppo di cui faccio parte aveva delle proposte da fare e delle domande su come svolgere alcune funzioni senza andar al contrasto con il clero... uno dei dirigenti disse che conosceva uno dei Principi della Chiesa e che sicuramente ci stava ad ascoltare e ci avrebbe dato qualche consiglio vedendo la buona fede. partimmo per Roma in 6 per incontrarlo, fu contattato per telefono e ci promise che in mattinata ne avremmo parlato. passata la sera in giro per Roma alla mattina volevamo fare un giro anche in San Pietro e quando ci trovammo davanti alla piazza il dirigente che conosceva il Principe ricevette una telefonata ed alla fine disse che dovevamo aspettare lì dove eravamo che sarebbe venuto qualcuno a parlarci... arrivò un piccolo pretino anziano ma vispo nello sguardo e dopo un saluto fulmineo iniziò a domandarci di tutto, sia per quello che eravamo lì che cosa della vita, era simpatico perché non solo comprendeva pienamente la proposta che volevamo fare ma anticipava noi stessi spiegando le problematiche e le possibilità, poi ad'un certo punto disse ""bene, ho tutti i dati per proporli all'incaricato, se volete farvi un giro in San Pietro seguitemi e poi vi ritrovo per dirvi cosa faremo""... seguimmo quell'uomo dal passo veloce, entrati ci salutò rinnovandoci l'incontro che seguiva più tardi... quando si allontanò dissi al dirigente che ci aveva portato lì ""beh... non avremmo incontrato il Principe in persona ma almeno questo nostro ambasciatore mi promette bene... come si chiama che non ho capito?"" ed il dirigente ""Ratzinger... è lui il Principe che dovevamo incontrare, il protettore dell'ortodossia Cattolica, ecc...""... ci rimasi di stucco, aveva una semplicità che non mi avrebbe mai fatto pensare... 
dopo un'oretta e più si avvicinò una persona e disse di seguirlo. ci portò proprio da lui che disse immediatamente ""ho parlato ma è normale che una proposta viene presa con diffidenza, comunque ho lasciato una porta aperta che adesso vi dirò come usarla, abbiate sempre fede che con essa possiamo fare tutto""... così ascoltammo e dopo il congedo eravamo più tranquilli che quella era la via giusta...
da allora non lo incontrammo più ma eravamo sempre in contatto... anzi, era lui che ci contattava quando dovevamo fare qualcosa! alla fine accettarono tutto ed anche di più di quello che per ipotesi credevamo fattibile... ad'un anno da quando diventò Papa ci richiamò convocandoci a Roma nell'incontro che fa nella piazza e voleva 2 persone in udienza che decidemmo andassero i 2 più anziani visto che di opportunità per noi giovani potevano ancora esserci... mandò il saluto a tutti noi che eravamo andati e ci eravamo impegnati, ricordandoci sempre di aver fede!",0,1360692552,null,0,false,0,c8dxp0z,t3_18dmyv,t1_c8dxp0z,t1_c8dvbgk,null,1435630330,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

With railways, the problem is only the infrastructure is seems, because its almost impossible to get a free market going with railways (initial investment is too high to make competition viable outside of extreme heavy use areas).

Wholly false, I already told you that in the beginning, the railroads were privately owned and much better managed than they are today.

[Here, if you don't mind, please what this bit about the railroads back then](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=EU_4vanP04I#t=536s).

&gt;If you run whatever type of company, public or private, that way, it will fail. This is a problem of bad management, nothing else.

If a private company does that, you're right, it will fail. It the state does that, it can't fail, the politicians just throw more of our money at it. That's what's been done here.

&gt;Again, if it is not possible to get a functioning market going, there will be no competition.

But it is possible to get a functioning market going, let's do it already and deregulate, everything to allow for the maximum amount of competition, it might seem effortless in this market where there are high fixed costs but it's definitely a better alternative than making it a state-owned monopoly instead of a privately-owned one and just pretend that will solve the issue.

&gt;If there is no competition, you don't get any of the good things of a free market, while losing the democratic accountability that comes with ""nationalized"" companies.

I don't know about you but a privately-owned monopoly is still much more accountable than a politician - complains, threats of collective action, negative PR campaigns and possibly even lawsuits can do much harm to a supplier even if it has a dominant position in the market.. as for politicians, they only care about you once in every 4 years and it's all done in a bundle, you have very limited choice, they're much more unaccountable and they don't have the same incentives to keep down costs as their salary is fixed and the taxpayers pay the bill.

&gt;I prefer ""government run"", most companies should not belong to ""the nation"" but to the local entity, that is the village, town or city district. 

Yes, I also prefer when things are done at the most local level possible, the whole principle of subsidiarity must stand, that way the government action is much more accountable to the population, though the issue I'm discussing here is not about that, on that I agree with you, the issue is the privately-owned vs state-owned (regardless of the level of government), and in this matter I think I already presented my arguments as to why it's best for the state to not intervene in the economy.",0,1360694817,null,0,false,0,c8dyf1t,t3_18dbd6,t1_c8dyf1t,t1_c8dxzsr,null,1431271856,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

Con un sistema bipolare all'italiana, come quello di prima, l'instabilità era molta. Due grosse, larghissime coalizioni si scontravano violentemente, dopodiché una vinceva, spesso con un distacco di pochi voti percentuali. Le elezioni poi in Italia non le vinci ""spostandoti al centro"" come in altre democrazie occidentali, ma pescando dai delusi o da elettori con posizioni ""estreme"". Questo meccanismo porta(va) poi a governi instabili e con posizioni populiste.

Veniamo all'entrata di Monti in politica. L'ex Presidente del Consiglio offre, in questo scenario, una sorta di sponda per il CSX, allontanandolo da posizioni demagogiche - Vendola lo sentiamo di meno in questi giorni - e proponendo a Bersani una coalizione post-voto con mandato le riforme necessarie al paese per ripartire. Senza contare poi che Monti qualche punto lo rosicchia anche al CDX.

Immaginatevi una situazione simile a quella che stiamo vivendo ora con in campo solo B. e Bersani. Saremmo con un CDX a pochi punti di distacco dal CSX e una grande situazione di incertezza, instabilità post-voto, e cazzi amari per noi tutti. Praticamente un 2006, again. Grazie Porcellum. 

Monti serve a questo, a mio avviso. Ma non vedete che non ha voglia? In veste di politico in campagna elettorale fa pena e non è per niente credibile (anzi, risulta molto antipatico).

What I mean by this is that there is the possibility that I'm wrong from time to time, as remote as it may be, because I neither have the time nor the resources to develop informed opinions on every matter. Fracking, incidentally, is something I know preciously little about, and don't really know whether I'm for or against it. I do suspect, though, that there are a number of people who have some very strong opinions despite knowing even less about it than I do.

So, what I want my representatives to do is to decide the way I would if I had all the necessary time and resources to develop an informed opinion, not necessarily the way I'd say if a pollster asked me right now.  

""Informed opinion"", btw., also involves how a decision affects other areas. I believe that too many people only look at issues in an isolated manner instead of as in context of how decisions would affect other areas. For example, most people would probably agree that the budgets for education, research, welfare, foreign aid and so on should be raised, taxes lowered, and the deficit reduced, when asked about one of those issues individually.

Civil Law - ""This can be contrasted with common law systems whose intellectual framework comes from judge-made decisional law which gives precedential authority to prior court decisions on the principle that it is unfair to treat similar facts differently on different occasions (doctrine of judicial precedent).""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_%28legal_system%29

Common Law - ""By contrast, in civil law jurisdictions, courts lack authority to act where there is no statute, and judicial precedent is given less interpretive weight (which means that a judge deciding a given case has more freedom to interpret the text of a statute independently, and less predictably), and scholarly literature is given more.""

I am in my fifth semester of studying physics at the University of Kiel. For a variety of reasons, I have actually considered just finishing my studies with the Bachelor's degree and looking for employment from then onwards. However, everyone I have asked about this plan (academic advisors, my professors, but also recruiters I have met at a job fair or colleagues at an internship I have done) have strongly advised against it.

Employment opportunities with a Master's degree in physics are magnitudes better than with a B.Sc. - my own research has pretty much confirmed this.

Can you read German?

Greece absolutely fucked it up.

It's not, but heavily regulated doesn't work in corrupt countries, and even in countries that aren't, when you have to heavily regulate something you have to question why aren't you running it anyway.  
  
I agree, that with strong regulation it is possible. The problem I think people are seeing, is that it is a step in the door. A step in the door that will undoubtedly lead to lobbying towards deregulation so they can have more profit from it.  
  
Maybe now everything is working fine in some places with the heavy regulation way (it's not working fine anywhere that I know without heavy regulation).

Isso da esquerda e direita é ridículo, para citar Ludwig von Mises:

&gt;The usual terminology of political language is stupid. What is 'left' and what is 'right'? Why should Hitler be 'right' and Stalin, his temporary friend, be 'left'? Who is 'reactionary' and who is 'progressive'? Reaction against an unwise policy is not to be condemned. And progress towards chaos is not to be commended. Nothing should find acceptance just because it is new, radical, and fashionable. 'Orthodoxy' is not an evil if the doctrine on which the 'orthodox' stand is sound. Who is anti-labor, those who want to lower labor to the Russian level, or those who want for labor the capitalistic standard of the United States? Who is 'nationalist,' those who want to bring their nation under the heel of the Nazis, or those who want to preserve its independence?

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt;In one section, it devotes five lines to the advantages of Britain having joined the European Economic Community – and 26 lines to the disadvantages. The book is thought to be taught in large numbers of British schools, part of a bestselling series for A-level students.

Ooooooh dear, 26 lines, such bias. As a Europhile and EU advocate this is rather pointless. Text books should always try and offer as many points of view as possible when it comes to history as that's the nature of the subject. If it fails to do that, it fails to be even a half decent A-level text book. However the evidence here seems to be breath if non existent. It says ""British people were kept in the dark"" and ""They were told there were no political implications attached"" both of which are true. That's not bias, that's just stating the facts.

Whilst I do think the text books should try and be impartial through providing multiple points of view [for history] it doesn't seem necessary that the text book has to be perfect. It has to be decent, yes, but not perfect. A large part of the AS and A2-level courses are about using multiple sources and not relying on one source, ie a text book. 

**In conclusion**, this is a non issue: There's little evidence it's actually being bias; Even if it is it's obviously not to an extent which is even worth mentioning. It'd be nice for the text book to have more pro Europe stuff, but it sounds like Europe is more of a side note in this text book as it is. We shouldn't expect every where that mentions Europe to offer both points equally. ",0,1360709494,null,0,false,0,c8e3kal,t3_18eiw0,t1_c8e3kal,t3_18eiw0,null,1431274364,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5
