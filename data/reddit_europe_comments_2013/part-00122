Source? 

Your links demonstrating Venezuela's ability to raise people up from hunger do not dispel my point.  Famine does not exist amongst democratic nations, hunger and malnutrition do.  This is bad, famine is *much* worse. 

You are ignorant or indoctrinated if you think democracy is against people's interests:

1. [Democratic nations don't go to war with each other.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory)

1. As mentioned before, Democratic states don't experience famines. 

My fellow Greeks and Spaniards are not dying precisely because they live in a democracy and elected officials cannot allow that to happen.  

&gt;Saying that it prevents famine, in the years when our fellow Greeks, Spaniards etc. are hit so hard by austerity that hundred-thousands are in despair, hunger and joblessness is silly.

You are silly for mistaking High Tier's of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs with fundamental building blocks of it.  **Preventing mass famine is much more valuable to a society than full employment.**  

I am fully cognizant of my exploitation as a member of the workforce, I sacrifice a portion of my productivity to be sheltered from the effects of being an independent contractor, which would yield me much more money, but far less stability.

Total population (of white people in the US)
223,553,265[3]
72.4% of the total U.S. population in 2010

 • Non-Hispanic White
196,817,552[3]
63.7% of the total U.S. population in 2010

 • White Hispanic or Latino Americans
26,735,713[3]
8.7% of the United States population 2010

It's no surprise that there are a lot of white people in America, or that white people form a majority in America, everyone knows that. My point is to show that the 200+ million white people living here makes America the single largest country by population of people with people with European blood. That's rather significant in my opinion. That just goes to show how similar we are with respect to other countries.

As to the rest of your comment, you and I see eye to eye. I honestly cannot think of another  relationship between two powers to have contributed so much positive to human history than the relationship between us. It's sad that there is so much ambivalence towards this relationship. I think it is self evident that we are better together than with the likes of Russia, China, Iran... I honestly don't think the relationship between us is that bad, and the shit you see on reddit/the internet in general is just a certain subset of peoples' opinions.

I certainly don't have any animosity towards Europeans, and I'd like to think they can say a good thing or two about us as well.

^ An executive order. A tool granted to the government to use in case of extreme disaster where proper parliamentary debate, even an urgent one, will endanger the integrity of the country (eg an invasion of a foreign force, a country-wide natural disaster etc). More over, this one wasn't supported by the two junior coalition partners of the government, and they didn't sign the order. This is not the first time it was used to circumvent proper democratic procedures. Few weeks ago it was used to criminalise the *thought* of  going on a strike (after a call by the Federation of Teachers Unions to decide *if they should* strike), before that it was used to break a different strike, before that it was used to grant immunity from investigation to a mining project that is widely thought to endanger public health, and there are some 15 more orders in a year's time. That's a lot of things not to go through the parliament.

* Since the government was the manager, it was their fault if ERT was failing. They appointed ""special counselors"" and other imaginary positions with monthly wages of 3500EUR just to accommodate their voters, while the real workers received a max of 1500EUR gross monthly salary (but also pay for their social insurance and the unemployment fund. Private channels have very 'lax' contracts that don't contribute to welfare). The person to announce the closure of ERT, Simos Kesidoglou was himself one of those people in the past. He was appointed at ERT by the party, he received specialised training in the US on ERT's budget, and instead of contributing back to ERT, he immediately went to work for a private channel.

Yes, and Europeans have spied on us, and each other's citizens, as well. As I covered in another post: 

*""I'm not defending the NSA scandal, it's fucked up as shit and should've never happened. But listen. You're foolish as hell if you think European countries arn't spying on Americans. And why? For the same reason we are spying on you. Domestic spying is illegal and hard to get away with, it's much easier to have a foreign ally spy on your citizens and to tell you what they found instead of you doing it yourself.*

*PRISM worked out just like our governments wanted, with most the blame going to America. The same would happen vice versa and it all works out in favor of both our governments. And this I guarantee you. The revelation of PRISM was in no way planned, but the reaction to it, went as expected and hoped for.*

*The U.S. isn't bullying your governments. IT'S WORKING WITH THEM. European governments arn't the losers, WE THE PEOPLE, are all collectively the losers. And sure, we can divide, but as the two of some of the most culturally and historically entwined nations, as the very bastion and cradle of the west, we would be more powerful, and more influential, if we integrate furthur instead of pushing furthur against each other.*

*And how about Sweden. Why do you not care about an allied European country, another one of your ""closest allies"", spying on all communication traffic in and out of their country? Why is there not the same level of outrage?""*",0,1371518501,null,0,false,0,cakxp7s,t3_1gj3ik,t1_cakxp7s,t1_cakxlmb,null,1430774810,-6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-6

Je contribue très peu à Wikipédia mais quand je vois une faute de grammaire (je fais beaucoup de faute moi-même alors je ne les vois sûrement pas toutes) ou un erreur de fait et que je connais la réponse, je fait une modification. Je n'ai même pas de compte sur Wikipédia. Calcule que j'effectue environ quatre ou cinq changements par année. 

Tes questions ne sont pas si simple à répondre. Je doute que mes réponses vont t'être très utiles. Par contre, peut-être que mon message incitera d'autres gens meilleurs que moi à répondre.

*Pourquoi Wikipédia doit être une (encyclopédie, c'est féminin ou masculin?) encyclopédie neutre/objective?*
Si Wikipédia n'essaie pas d'être objective, comment peut-on la considérer comme une encyclopédie? Je veux dire, quand on cherche de l'information sur un sujet, on veut normalement une vue d'ensemble. Par exemple, sur la page pour [Amiante](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiante), il faut pouvoir lire non seulement que c'est cancérigène, mais aussi que ça a des propriétés isolante et ignifuge.

*Wikipédia est-elle une encyclopédie transparente?* Beaucoup plus qu'une encyclopédie papier. Sur Wikipédia, on peut consulter toutes les modifications qu'un article a subi, ainsi que toutes les tractations qui ont menées à l'effacement d'un article, par exemple. Il n'y a rien de ça dans une encyclopédie classique.

*Y a-t-il un lien entre neutralité et transparence?* La transparence aide certainement à la neutralité mais Wikipédia est fragile à la [pensée de groupe](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pens%C3%A9e_de_groupe) qui peut nuire à la neutralité.

true,InitiumNovum,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; The Irish Potato famine was not just deadly because of **there were not enough potatoes but because of unchecked market forces: most of the potatoes were exported, driving up the price of the potatoes consumed internally.** As many people in Ireland were quite poor at that time, this lead to starvation.

There a lot of misinformation here:

Firstly, there was a large potato blight (phytophthora infestans) which plagued Ireland and western Europe during the 1840s, though its effect hit Ireland worse. This killed off all the potato crops, eliminating the primary stable diet of most Irish tenant farmers at the time. Therefore the statement *""most of the potatoes were exported, driving up the price of the potatoes consumed internally""* is incorrect -- how could you export potatoes if all the potato crops were dead?  

Secondly, you're leaving out another crucial detail: Ireland was basically ruled by what was akin to a small feudal aristocracy at the time, whereby most of the land in Ireland was owned by a small number of landlords and that most of the Irish Catholic population were tenants (or serfs). This great disparity in land ownership was primary due to the fact that Irish Catholics (the majority of the population of the island) were not allowed to own land until the late 18th century (Penal Laws). The dominance of these aristocratic landlords in Ireland only began to subside at the end of the 19th century with the movement towards land reforms. 

These Irish tenants farmers were usually allotted the worst land in the landlords' estates so that better lands could be used for growing more lucrative agricultural produce and grazing livestock. A lot of these other foodstuffs were exported, thus contributing to the landlord's income. These small allotments given to tenant farmers usually weren't suited for growing anything other than potatoes. Therefore, when the potato blight arrived, the primary diet of the tenant farmers was cut off, thus leading to the famine.

And you forget we broke that isolation *to come to the aid of European allies*. And not only did we come to their aid, we helped rebuild Western Europe with the Marshall Plan. We didn't come in and impose an iron will like the Soviets did in Eastern Europe. 

Hell, the Marshall Plan, and American's contribution to NATO, ensuring that the Soviets didn't come storming through the Fulda Gap, is probably why the framework was in place for both the European Coal &amp; Steel and the European Atomic Energy Communities to take shape. And those two organizations are considered by most to be the direct forerunners of the EU. 

Now I'm not saying America should take **ANY CREDIT** for the EU being what it is today. That is solely the work of European legislators and thinkers. **BUT**, we did plow the fields so the seeds of a united Europe could be planted. 

&gt;Today, what makes the USA different is that we're all fucking terrified of how they're watching everything they do and also that they could kill us all with their military which takes up half of their budget.

Cut the bullshit man. Nobody in Europe is afraid that the American Military is going to kill them. The hyperbole and exaggeration in that statement you just made is pathetic. 

And remember, the reason that the U.S. Military DOES take up half-the-budget, and the reason European militaries are so small, it probably because we took a shit load of the responsibility, and fiscal burden, of defending Europe through-out the Cold War. 

And now we're pivoting away from Europe, and every day NATO becomes a little more less-efficient. Look at Bosnia, Mali &amp; Libya. Each of those operations needed American military support, whether it's troops, ammunition, logistics or intelligence, to succeed. 

And the thing is, as my President and European leaders have said, and which many Europeans are now beginning to realize, is that as the American military gets smaller, or as it is now, ""pivots"" away from Europe, the EU needs to build up it's own military and integrate it's states' militaries. 

The only ones actually pulling the weight are France, Britain &amp; the United States. And with the United States out of the picture, and that big military you bitched about gone, Europe just can't keep the status quo of relying on the above two if it wants to continue to be an actual influence in the world. 

The honey moon is over. The Cold War is over. France and Britain can't defend all of Europe, or maintain the majority of Europe's military, forever. The EU needs to consolidate itself, European countries to spend more on defense as America moves away from Cold War-strategies. 

**TL;DR Western Culture &amp; the Marshall Plan prove your first point wrong. With that big military you're scared of going away, as we speak, your country needs to spend more on defense to compensate, as it just can't expect France and the United Kingdom (and America...for now...but we've begun our ""pivot"" to the Pacific) to take care of everything.

In totally, 50,000 Irish people, from the Irish Free State, fought during the Second World War, but only 10% of these were branded as deserters because they had left their posts in the Irish Defense Forces without permission. In any other country, if a soldier leaves his/her post without permission and joins another army (hostile, allied or neutral) that would technically be regarded as desertion and would be treated in a similar manner.

true,Taenk,GERM,"For a democratic, European confederation","I have the impression that a lot of redditors take this as an oppurtunity to vent their frustration with the USA or more specifically with it's less than popular policies like the war on drugs or a policy of foreign intervention. Europe and North America are different in mentality and this should be reflected in different policies. Europeans are sick of ""American"" wars and want no part of this, at least the Europeans on reddit.

Of course we have both benefited greatly from innovation, science, technology, free trade and culture but the good does not wash away the bad and the ugly. Europeans need to learn how to use their money: You get you buy and if that is American products, you get American products.

ci sono periodicamente delle buone offerte, sia sulle magliette che sui costi spedizione, che ti permettono di ammortizzare i costi totali. 

Le taglie delle magliette sono più grandi che da noi, per dire io qua vesto sulla L mentre la loro M non mi va stretta, in ogni caso sul sito ti danno tutte le misure di petto e lunghezza per taglia. Inoltre, a differenza delle nostre magliette, le loro sono abbastanza lunghe in proporzione.

La spedizione è lentissima, non so se per colpa loro o della dogana. Loro ti dicono ""la consegna avverrà tra x e y, ma mai dopo z"" e a me le cose sono sempre arrivate tra y e z, vale a dire minimo un mese.

Inoltre la dogana ti ci tasserà sia un costo fisso (5 euro) sia la percentuale di IVA, da pagare al corriere, quindi c'è da considerare anche questo. Inoltre la tassazione IVA avverrà sull'intero importo senza contare eventuali sconti: mi è successo di aver fatto un acquisto di 120 € scontati da 200 € e la tassa percentuale mi è stata calcolata sui 200. Ho chiesto chiarimenti sia alla dogana che al sito, ed entrambi mi hanno detto che è così e devo fare pippa (il sito in modo gentile, la dogana con una supercazzola normativa).

In generale sono molto soddisfatto delle mie magliette e capita che mi facciano complimenti perché sono dei design davvero belli, solo dato che insomma un po' devo trovare l'occasione giusta un po' sotto un tot di magliette non mi conviene comprare, io accumulo magliette nel tempo per poi fare acquisti periodici di almeno 6-7 magliette, ma riesco sempre a risparmiare tra offerte e sconti pagando un costo effettivo di max 15 $ a maglietta (distribuendo anche i costi di spedizione e tasse doganali).",0,1371537867,null,0,false,0,cal3l6f,t3_1gjxtz,t1_cal3l6f,t3_1gjxtz,null,1430771963,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

Slavery existed under capitalism and indeed was one of its primary drivers in the early days.

Democracy, on the other hand, has little relationship to capitalism.  Capitalists will use any form of government to pursue their agendas, but its true that holding elections every now and then tends to keep populations distracted enough to get on with the real business of business, so procedural democracies are quite popular.  Genuine democracies are to be avoided at all costs because they progress towards socialism very rapidly - people vote for abolition of debt and land/private property redistribution very rapidly since it's so clearly in their interests to do so. The founding fathers were very clear on this when they wrote the American constitution to be particularly resistant to any real democracy - the rich have to be protected from the poor, two wolves and a sheep and all that...  

If you really want to appreciate capitalism's real attitude towards democracy, consider how absent democracy is in the economic sphere where most adults spend most of their days, in corporations.

ecco l'interrogazione parlamentare:

&gt; domanda: secondo quanto previsto dall'art. 3 della legge, ""Ai fini del Trattato di cui all'articolo 1, la Forza di polizia italiana a statuto militare per la Forza di gendarmeria europea è l'Arma dei Carabinieri""; un'interpretazione di quanto previsto dal Trattato, diffusasi anche via Internet, vedrebbe quale conseguenza della ratifica del Trattato addirittura l'abolizione dell'Arma dei Carabinieri, fatti salvi quei contingenti che andrebbero a costituire la forza di polizia multinazionale a statuto militare (EUROGENDFOR);

&gt; risponde il ministro della difesa:  Nel trattato istitutivo della Forza di gendarmeria europea (EGF) non sono presenti norme concernenti l'ordinamento e i compili interni delle Forze di polizia nazionali dei Paesi aderenti, né tali norme sono presenti nella relativa legge di ratifica (legge 14 maggio 2010, n. 84), se non per prevedere la partecipazione dell'Arma dei Carabinieri al nuovo organismo.
Le ipotesi interpretative prospettate sono da intendersi, pertanto, non soltanto ""in palese contrasto con il testo del trattato"", come rilevato, ma ad esso neppure riferibili.
L'istituzione della Forza di gendarmeria europea non prevede in realtà la costituzione di una organica Forza di polizia internazionale, né di reparti operativi stabili, bensì la possibilità per i Paesi membri di intervenire congiuntamente, attraverso la costituzione di reparti *ad hoc*, nelle missioni internazionali in cui siano richieste le particolari competenze professionali e capacità operative delle Forze di polizia a *status* militare di cui tali Paesi sono dotate, sulla base dei principi di reciprocità e di ripartizione dei costi.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, that is my answer. And it's more ""typically arrogant"" to completely ignore reality and replace it with your own idealistic version of it. 

Listen, this isn't some fairytale world we live in. I'm not conjuring boogeymen, but I am trying to remind you that *threats and crises do happen*. Europe, under the umbrella of American defense spending and security, has grown complacent with ignoring their defense and neglecting their militaries. 

Here's the thing though; The Cold War is over. The Fulda Gap is no longer existent, the fall of Europe no longer a concern of America, and the American military's presence there, as it was in past years, no longer strategically needed. Hence the whole ""pivot to the Pacific"" we're undergoing in preparation for the *""Asian Century""* as it has been deemed. 

Now you can sit there and tell me there's no threat to Europe. You can tell me that [Russia is no longer the belligerent country it once was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics). You can tell me that there is [NO CHANCE of any Inter-European Conflict](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_War). You can tell me that your neighboring region, [North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_civil_war), has no conflict that could [threaten Europe's security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mali_conflict). You can even tell me that the Middle East is stable with [no chance of conflict throwing the whole region, and by extension, Europe's Mediterranian Lake into disarray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war).

At which point I'd call bullshit on ALL accounts. 

Europe's two neighboring regions, North Africa and the Middle East, are ticking time bombs of unrest that Europe will eventually, even if it plugs its fingers in it's ears and try to ignore it, have to face. Either defensively or with interventions. The Balkans is always ripe for implosions and genocides which Europe will also be forced to deal with itself; Look at the [Srebrenica Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre) for an example when it doesn't. And Russia, despite how non-chalant and friendly they appear, that's sarcasm by the way, are still kinda pissed they've been knocked off their pedestal and pushed to a 2nd rate power. Eastern Europe and the Balkans have always been in their sphere and the EUs expansion of influence in those two regions won't go as well as your pacifist little heart would hope. 

Now in the EU, where most countries have been freed of focusing on defense because of America, France and the United Kingdom; they have instead chose to spend on social benefits. That's fucking great..you know...while the U.S. was footing the bill. But we won't be anymore. And that's a problem....*for you*....

And should we forget Bosnian, Mali or Libyan operations? All EUROPEAN MILITARY OPERATIONS that got underway, but than needed AMERICAN military, logistical and intelligence support. Europe can't, at the moment, launch an independent operation without begging America to help, specifically because of the neglect they've given their militaries under America's little security umbrella. Do you want to be dominated and influenced at such  a large degree by America? Really? You bitch about American influence, but make no move to correct it so it doesn't happen, and isn't needed, in the future. 

If the EU wants to actually become a real power in the future, one which has influence at the negotiating table, one which can push for more diplomacy, more socialist programs, more pacifists and aid programs, it needs an actual fucking military. One that's cordinated, one's that united and one's that streamlined, for both strategic, and budgetary reasons. 

You can't put the weight on France and the United Kingdom alone. You can't put the weight on my country. Now I gurantee you that because of my country's commitment to your continent, we will stay around and protect you even if you don't get your shit together, but for god's sake, for both my country's benefit, your state's benefit and the EU as a whole's benefit, GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER MILITARILY.

**TL;DR You have two unstable and chaotic neighboring regions. You have a ever-present Russia who wants to increase it's influence over your Eastern and Balkan states as a neighbor. You have the ever-present threat of ethnic conflict in the Balkins.**

**It's easy to spend no money on the military when America's footing the bill. But we're not anymore. Well we are...but come on....don't put your country's defense in my country's hands. Take it over yourself so we don't have too run it. And if we're gone, you just can't rely on the UK &amp; France, that's fucked up to those countries.**

**You want a cheaper military? A stronger Europe? One that can actually influence the world with all those western values? Have the EU integrate militarily.**

true,nod23,NORW,Norway,"&gt; What I'm asking about is the actual data, which don't contain real information, and why people are so concerned about You can't know anything real when you have metadata. 

No real Information? Only metadata? According to [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data):

*A chart prepared by the NSA, contained within the top-secret document obtained by the Guardian, underscores the breadth of the data it is able to obtain: email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP (Skype, for example) chats, file transfers, social networking details, and more.*

Are you still going to claim they only look at metadata? The ""metadata"" of my Facebook profile? Well, that *is* my profile, hehe. The sound of my voice on Skype? Do you suppose they only record the pitch?

No, I'm sorry, they collect a lot more information than that or can access it at will. That is *precisely* the problem, let's answer that in the next paragraph: 

&gt; Yet our own countries do exactly the same thing to our own people

Firstly, that is a claim you make, I doubt you know my country's secret service. I dispute that they monitor us to the same degree. Let's leave it at that.

However, whatever *my* gov't does is exactly the point I made previously. It can be perfectly *legal* for them to keep tabs on our society. If they trespass and violate our own laws they will pay for it. That is if and when we find out about it. Any foreign power doing so is effectively attacking my state. 

The US is trespassing on my freedom and privacy simply by having access and/or storing it. The same would apply to other foreign countries *if* they did/do the same. Comparing what the US does with what my gov't does is **not** a valid argument!

&gt; Instead of jumping on the anti-USA ""us vs them"" bandwagon, we should look at all countries, not just the USA here.

Yes, that is a fair point to make. Of course there doesn't seem to be anyone else out there with similar capabilities or the will to do so! There's also the fact that it is major American corporations that dominate the Internet. There is no French Google in the US with similar capabilities, or Chinese corporations for that matter. Sure, the Chinese and Europeans spy, but we don't have access to your networks or citizens wholesale.

Those American corporations, or their subsidiaries incorporated in Europe, fail to abide by our/local laws. The US gov't clearly, *knowingly* infringes on our sovereignty by requiring them to hand over information regardless of origin/location. I don't blame Google for following US law, I blame the US gov't for abusing it. ",0,1371542791,null,0,false,0,cal4g5s,t3_1gia4c,t1_cal4g5s,t1_cal34ry,null,1430771558,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

di Mauro Munafò

(17 giugno 2013)

*Nelle istruzioni ai militanti per il sit-in davanti a Montecitorio ci sono perfino le frasi esatte con cui rispondere alle domande dei giornalisti, tipo: «A me sembra che il M5S goda di ottima salute». Altre raccomandazioni: «Quando vi fanno domande sull'ipotesi di scissione rispondete con una risata oppure sbadigliate»*

Tra i giornalisti e il Movimento 5 Stelle, è noto a tutti, c'è un rapporto piuttosto complicato. Dopo aver accusato i cronisti di essere 'pennivendoli', 'servi della casta', 'pagati da xxx per screditare il Movimento', alcuni attivisti pentastellati hanno finalmente trovato la soluzione per evitare gaffe a mezzo stampa: dettare a tutti, anche all'ultimo dei simpatizzanti e dei manifestanti, cosa deve dire in caso di intervista e come deve difendere Beppe Grillo, arrivando persino a suggerire sbadigli e scrollate di spalle in favore di telecamera.

Poche ore prima della manifestazione in sostegno dell'ex comico davanti a Montecitorio infatti, gli organizzatori dell'evento hanno pensato bene [di diffondere delle ""linee guida""](https://www.facebook.com/events/431040460327790/permalink/432741433491026/) ufficiali a tutti i simpatizzanti per ""consigliare"", o meglio ""raccomandare"", come comportarsi durante la mobilitazione.

Consigli in gran parte dettati del buon senso, con una significativa eccezione: il modo di interagire con la stampa. E' proprio in queste circostanze che il documento raggiunge nuove vette di comicità involontaria.

Si parte con una semplice raccomandazione (tutta in maiuscolo), su come reagire in caso di domande sui dissidenti. ""Ai giornalisti che saranno in piazza, CI RACCOMANDIAMO di rispondere con garbo, con cortesia questa semplice frase, se provocati su eventuali dissidenti"", [si legge](https://www.facebook.com/events/431040460327790/), ""Chi non mantiene il rispetto per i cittadini e per gli elettori è fuori del M5S, sia esso attivista, consigliere, deputato o senatore. I valori del M5S non si discutono"".

Certo, se poi si riuscisse anche a strappare qualche altro secondo all'intervistatore, perché non approfittarne per difendere il 'megafono' del Movimento. ""Peraltro, se ci riusciamo, diciamo che Grillo NON ha parlato male del Parlamento"" continuano le linee guida, ""ma ne ha solo denunciato la condizione degenerata. Anche Scalfaro, ex presidente, anche autorevoli giornalisti ne denunciavano lo svilimento ma nessuno ha osato obiettare. Le parole di Grillo invece sono state strumentalizzate, ecc. ecc."". Vale la pena sottolineare che gli 'ecc. ecc' e le maiuscole sono riportate nel post ufficiale e non sono stati aggiunti da noi.

Tutto chiaro? Forse no. Meglio fare una bella ricapitolazione finale per non rischiare incomprensioni. Ed ecco come si conclude la parte sulle risposte ai giornalisti. ""In soldoni, sminuire i problemi, liquidare con una risata le ipotesi di scissione, accogliere con uno sbadiglio e una scrollata di spalle le previsioni di fine del MoVimento. Se la piazza è gremita come dovrebbe essere, basta rispondere indicando la gente: ""A me sembra che il MoVimento sia vivo e vegeto e che goda di ottima salute, a lei?"".

Un bell'esempio di democrazia dal basso con risposte dettate, anzi 'raccomandate', dall'alto. Qui in fondo, per completezza di informazione, riportiamo le linee guida integrali [postate sulla pagina Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/431040460327790/permalink/432741433491026/) dell'iniziativa da parte degli organizzatori, e subito messe in evidenza.

IMPORTANTE! LINEE GUIDA PER LA MANIFESTAZIONE

A tutte/i

Grazie infinite a tutti per la partecipazione in questi giorni precedenti alla manifestazione. Ecco alcune linee guida da seguire domani, in modo da ottenere il risultato principale: mostrare all'Italia che il M5S è coeso, compatto, unito e che la lotta è ben lungi dall'essere terminata.  Anzi, è solo all'inizio!

1) Cerchiamo di venire tutti fin da subito, fin dalle nove. Il punto d'incontro è esattamente quello della foto sopra, sotto l'obelisco davanti a Montecitorio. Più siamo fin dall'inizio, meno i giornalisti potranno filmare una piazza vuota e mandare in onda immagini che decretano il flop. 
Un piccolo sforzo per una giornata importante come domani!

2) La manifestazione è PACIFICA! Non è un redde rationem, né uno showdown in stile western, né una marcia su Montecitorio. 
Siamo lì per manifestare il nostro affetto a Beppe Grillo e ai nostri deputati e senatori. Il fatto che vi sia aria di dissidenza dev'essere considerato quasi ""ACCIDENTALE"".

Ai giornalisti che saranno in piazza, CI RACCOMANDIAMO di rispondere con garbo, con cortesia questa semplice frase, se provocati su eventuali dissidenti: ""Chi non mantiene il rispetto per i cittadini e per gli elettori è fuori del M5S, sia esso attivista, consigliere, deputato o senatore. I valori del M5S non si discutono"". 
Peraltro, se ci riusciamo, diciamo che Grillo NON ha parlato male del Parlamento ma ne ha solo denunciato la condizione degenerata. Anche Scalfaro, ex presidente, anche autorevoli giornalisti ne denunciavano lo svilimento ma nessuno ha osato obiettare. Le parole di Grillo invece sono state strumentalizzate, ecc. ecc.
In soldoni, sminuire i problemi, liquidare con una risata le ipotesi di scissione, accogliere con uno sbadiglio e una scrollata di spalle le previsioni di fine del MoVimento. Se la piazza è gremita come dovrebbe essere, basta rispondere indicando la gente: ""A me sembra che il MoVimento sia vivo e vegeto e che goda di ottima salute, a lei?"". Poi ovviamente ognuno risponda come vuole o ritiene opportuno ma NON reagisca alle provocazioni.

3) Rischio INFILTRATI e FACINOROSI. Aiutiamoci TUTTI QUANTI a identificarli e ad arginarli. In Piazza ci sono tanti ragazzi che fanno parte del servizio d'ordine nei grandi eventi, e che provengono dalle forze dell'ordine o di polizia, quindi sanno trattare perfettamente il problema. Evitiamo di prendere iniziative personali ma cerchiamo di fare gruppo e di reagire con intelligenza.

4) Varie ed eventuali. Nei commenti mettete pure tutte le obiezioni possibili e immaginabili e i consigli per come affrontare meglio la giornata di domani e renderla un grande successo.

The article is, unfortunately, wrong. The FRA law itself is public information, as they say. So are the PATRIOT Act and the establishment of FISA. Neither have been sufficiently challenged in courts. And while the courts who would give warrants under the EU Data Retention Directive are public, the warrants are obviously not published at once, and the data collected would never be seen before it's actually used in court – at which point American prosecutors would have to give up their sources as well.

They mention the Swedish court involved in these processes as well. This court, like FISA, has no appeals process. The government appoints the judges more or less directly. And it has processes to make decisions without their so-called privacy officer if an attack is conveniently imminent. Because getting that guy in there is obviously harder than the judges because he takes the non-CCTV'd route to work, I guess?

If it's quality standards, I don't have much hard facts about phone industry other than few anecdotal tales about shitty Motorola-phones and great Huawei-phones.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The real world does not work like this. Businesses drive towards efficiency anyway, and that means pushing workers harder, yes, and the laws have little effect on it. Even in the case of strongly worker friendly laws like Austria, there are ways to push workers hard. For example simply increasing load without increasing hours - for example, giving cleaners 40 hotel rooms to clean a day, do in 8 hours, no overtime allowed, and scold them if they are not finished or not well done, so the emotional stress coming from not wanting to feel worthless because of the daily scolding will make them literally run all day and work so hard that they are physically exhausted. How would you prevent that by legislation? Or, also in Austria, a grocery store has only 2 cashiers, but only one of them is in the cassa, the other one is in the back packing shelves, then when the queue is long, the other cashier presses a buttong, a bell goes off, and the other cashier literally runs forward and opens the other cassa, and has to endure the emotional stress of angry customers looking at him like if it was his fault. 

This it just as much a worker exploitation as long hours, if not worse - my wife would have gladly taken unpaid overtime if it would have meant less stress and rush all day - and laws cannot protect against it. 

Laws cannot protect from exploitation, just turn one kind into another kind. Not matter what you have in laws, an employer can always give you a mountain, tell you to take it down by the end of the day, and if you don't make you feel like a worthless piece of shit with criticism and kill your self-esteem, so you will just have to push yourself to do it anyway and get exploited no matter what the laws.

Therefore, it is better to have more flexible laws. Because it is better to have 1-2 unpaid overtime hours a day, but keeping the pace of work humane, stress-free, cheerful, than if it is strictly 8 hours and everybody must clock out at 17:00 but a lot of work must be done with a low staff so is it is gogoGOGODOITDOITCOMEONCOMEON a rushing, yelling, angry, crazy day, and everybody is an emotional trainwreck at the end of the day.",0,1371554598,null,0,false,0,cal5ysw,t3_1gh5f0,t1_cal5ysw,t1_cakk14z,null,1430770842,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Di Umberto Eco, tratto da *Cinque scritti morali*, Bompiani (1997)

--------

1) *La prima caratteristica di un Ur-Fascismo è il culto della tradizione.*

Il tradizionalismo è più vecchio del fascismo. Non fu solo tipico del pensiero controrivoluzionario cattolico dopo la Rivoluzione Francese, ma nacque nella tarda età ellenistica come una reazione al razionalismo greco classico.

Nel bacino del Mediterraneo, i popoli di religioni diverse (tutte accettate con indulgenza dal Pantheon romano) cominciarono a sognare una rivelazione ricevuta all'alba della storia umana. Questa rivelazione era rimasta a lungo nascosta sotto il velo di lingue ormai dimenticate. Era affidata ai geroglifici egiziani, alle rune dei celti, ai testi sacri, ancora sconosciuti, delle religioni asiatiche. Questa nuova cultura doveva essere sincretistica. ""Sincretismo"" non è solo, come indicano i dizionari, la combinazione di forme diverse di credenze o pratiche. Una simile combinazione deve tollerare le contraddizioni. Tutti i messaggi originali contengono un germe di saggezza e quando sembrano dire cose diverse o incompatibili è solo perché tutti alludono, allegoricamente, a qualche verità primitiva. Come conseguenza, non ci può essere avanzamento del sapere. La verità è stata già annunciata una volta per tutte, e noi possiamo solo continuare a interpretare il suo oscuro messaggio. E sufficiente guardare il sillabo di ogni movimento fascista per trovare i principali pensatori tradizionalisti. La gnosi nazista si nutriva di elementi tradizionalisti, sincretistici, occulti. La più importante fonte teoretica della nuova destra italiana, Julius Evola, mescolava il Graal con i Protocolli dei Savi di Sion, l'alchimia con il Sacro Romano Impero. Il fatto stesso che per mostrare la sua apertura mentale una parte della destra italiana abbia recentemente ampliato il suo sillabo mettendo insieme De Maistre, Guenon e Gramsci è una prova lampante di sincretismo. Se curiosate tra gli scaffali che nelle librerie americane portano l'indicazione ""New Age"", troverete persino Sant'Agostino, il quale, per quanto ne sappia, non era fascista. Ma il fatto stesso di mettere insieme Sant'Agostino e Stonehenge, questo è un sintomo di Ur-Fascismo.

2) *Il tradizionalismo implica il rifiuto del modernismo.*

Sia i fascisti che i nazisti adoravano la tecnologia, mentre i pensatori tradizionalisti di solito rifiutano la tecnologia come negazione dei valori spirituali tradizionali. Tuttavia, sebbene il nazismo fosse fiero dei suoi successi industriali, la sua lode della modernità era solo l'aspetto superficiale di una ideologia basata sul ""sangue"" e la ""terra"" (Blut und Boden). Il rifiuto del mondo moderno era camuffato come condanna del modo di vita capitalistico, ma riguardava principalmente il rigetto dello spirito del 1789 (o del 1776, ovviamente). L'illuminismo, l'età della Ragione vengono visti come l'inizio della depravazione moderna. In questo senso, l'Ur-Fascismo può venire definito come ""irrazionalismo"".

3) *L'irrazionalismo dipende anche dal culto dell azione per l'azione.*

L'azione è bella di per sé, e dunque deve essere attuata prima di e senza una qualunque riflessione. Pensare è una forma di evirazione. Perciò la cultura è sospetta nella misura in cui viene identificata con atteggiamenti critici. Dalla dichiarazione attribuita a Goebbels (""Quando sento parlare di cultura, estraggo la mia pistola"") all'uso frequente di espressioni quali ""Porci intellettuali"", ""Teste d'uovo"", ""Snob radicali"", ""Le università sono un covo di comunisti"", il sospetto verso il mondo intellettuale è sempre stato un sintomo di Ur-Fascismo. Gli intellettuali fascisti ufficiali erano principalmente impegnati nell'accusare la cultura moderna e l'intellighenzia liberale di aver abbandonato i valori tradizionali.

4) *Nessuna forma di sincretismo può accettare la critica.* 

Lo spirito critico opera distinzioni, e distinguere è un segno di modernità. Nella cultura moderna, la comunità scientifica intende il disaccordo come strumento di avanzamento delle conoscenze. Per l'Ur-Fascismo, il disaccordo è tradimento.

5) *Il disaccordo è inoltre un segno di diversità.* 

L'Ur-Fascismo cresce e cerca il consenso sfruttando ed esacerbando la naturale paura della differenza. Il primo appello di un movimento fascista o prematuramente fascista è contro gli intrusi. L'Ur-Fascismo è dunque razzista per definizione.

6) *L'Ur-Fascismo scaturisce dalla frustrazione individuale o sociale.*

Il che spiega perché una delle caratteristiche tipiche dei fascismi storici è stato l'appello alle classi medie frustrate, a disagio per qualche crisi economica o umiliazione politica, spaventate dalla pressione dei gruppi sociali subalterni. Nel nostro tempo, in cui i vecchi ""proletari"" stanno diventando piccola borghesia (e i Lumpen si autoescludono dalla scena politica), il fascismo troverà in questa nuova maggioranza il suo uditorio.

7) *A coloro che sono privi di una qualunque identità sociale, l'Ur-Fascismo dice che il loro unico privilegio è il più comune di tutti, quello di essere nati nello stesso paese.*

E questa l'origine del *nazionalismo*: Inoltre, gli unici che possono fornire una identità alla nazione sono i nemici. Così, alla radice della psicologia Ur-Fascista vi è l'ossessione del complotto, possibilmente internazionale. I seguaci debbono sentirsi assediati. Il modo più facile per far emergere un complotto è quello di fare appello alla xenofobia. Ma il complotto deve venire anche dall'interno: gli ebrei sono di solito l'obiettivo migliore, in quanto presentano il vantaggio di essere al tempo stesso dentro e fuori. In America, ultimo esempio dell'ossessione del complotto è rappresentato dal libro *The New World Order* di Pat Robertson.

(continua)",0,1371555435,null,0,false,0,cal634x,t3_1gkh02,t1_cal634x,t3_1gkh02,null,1430770786,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5
true,strozzapreti,null,null,"8) *I seguaci debbono sentirsi umiliati dalla ricchezza ostentata e dalla forza dei nemici.* 

Quando ero bambino mi insegnavano che gli inglesi erano il ""popolo dei cinque pasti"": mangiavano più spesso degli italiani, poveri ma sobri. Gli ebrei sono ricchi e si aiutano l'un l'altro grazie a una rete segreta di mutua assistenza. I seguaci debbono tuttavia essere convinti di poter sconfiggere i nemici. Così, grazie a un continuo spostamento di registro retorico, i nemici sono al tempo stesso troppo forti e troppo deboli. I fascismi sono condannati a perdere le loro guerre, perché sono costituzionalmente incapaci di valutare con obiettività la forza del nemico.

9) *Per l'Ur-Fascismo non c'è lotta per la vita, ma piuttosto ""vita per la lotta"".*

Il pacifismo è allora collusione col nemico; il pacifismo è cattivo perché la vita è una guerra permanente. Questo tuttavia porta con sé un complesso di Armageddon: dal momento che i nemici debbono e possono essere sconfitti, ci dovrà essere una battaglia finale, a seguito della quale il movimento avrà il controllo del mondo. Una simile soluzione finale implica una successiva era di pace, un'età dell'Oro che contraddice il principio della guerra permanente. Nessun leader fascista è mai riuscito a risolvere questa contraddizione.

10) *L'elitismo è un aspetto tipico di ogni ideologia reazionaria, in quanto fondamentalmente aristocratico.* 

Nel corso della storia, tutti gli elitismi aristocratici e militaristici hanno implicato il disprezzo per i deboli. L'Ur-Fascismo non può fare a meno di predicare un ""elitismo popolare"". Ogni cittadino appartiene al popolo migliore del mondo, i membri del partito sono i cittadini migliori, ogni cittadino può (o dovrebbe) diventare un membro del partito. Ma non possono esserci patrizi senza plebei. Il leader, che sa bene come il suo potere non sia stato ottenuto per delega, ma conquistato con la forza, sa anche che la sua forza si basa sulla debolezza delle masse, così deboli da aver bisogno e da meritare un ""dominatore"". Dal momento che il gruppo è organizzato gerarchicamente (secondo un modello militare), ogni leader subordinato disprezza i suoi subalterni, e ognuno di loro disprezza i suoi sottoposti. Tutto ciò rinforza il senso di un elitismo di massa.

11) *In questa prospettiva, ciascuno è educato per diventare un eroe.*

In ogni mitologia l'""eroe"" è un essere eccezionale, ma nell'ideologia Ur-Fascista l'eroismo è la norma. Questo culto dell'eroismo è strettamente legato al culto della morte: non a caso il motto dei falangisti era: ""Viva la muerte”. Alla gente normale si dice che la morte è spiacevole ma bisogna affrontarla con dignità; ai credenti si dice che è un modo doloroso per raggiungere una felicità soprannaturale. L'eroe Ur-Fascista, invece, aspira alla morte, annunciata come la migliore ricompensa per una vita eroica. L'eroe Ur-Fascista è impaziente di morire. Nella sua impazienza, va detto in nota, gli riesce più di frequente far morire gli altri.

12) *Dal momento che sia la guerra permanente sia l'eroismo sono giochi difficili da giocare, l'Ur-Fascista trasferisce la sua volontà di potenza su questioni sessuali.*

È questa l'origine delmachismo (che implica disdegno per le donne e una condanna intollerante per abitudini sessuali non conformiste, dalla castità all'omosessualità). Dal momento che anche il sesso è un gioco difficile da giocare, l'eroe Ur-Fascista gioca con armi, che sono il suo *Ersatz fallico*: i suoi giochi di guerra sono dovuti a una invidia penis permanente.

13) *L'Ur-Fascismo si basa su un ""populismo qualitativo"" : In una democrazia i cittadini godono di diritti individuali, ma l'insieme dei cittadini è dotato di un impatto politico solo dal punto di vista quantitativo (si seguono le decisioni della maggioranza).*

Per l'Ur-Fascismo gli individui in quanto individui non hanno diritti, e il ""popolo"" è concepito come una qualità, un'entità monolitica che esprime la ""volontà comune"". Dal momento che nessuna quantità di esseri umani può possedere una volontà comune, il leader pretende di essere il loro interprete. Avendo perduto il loro potere di delega, i cittadini non agiscono, sono solo chiamati pars pro toto, a giocare il ruolo del popolo. Il popolo è così solo una finzione teatrale. Per avere un buon esempio di populismo qualitativo, non abbiamo più bisogno di Piazza Venezia o dello stadio di Norimberga. Nel nostro futuro si profila un populismo qualitativo Tv o Internet, in cui la risposta emotiva di un gruppo selezionato di cittadini può venire presentata e accettata come la ""voce del popolo"". A ragione del suo populismo qualitativo, l'Ur-Fascismo deve opporsi ai ""putridi"" governi parlamentari. Una delle prime frasi pronunciate da Mussolini nel parlamento italiano fu: ""Avrei potuto trasformare quest'aula sorda e grigia in un bivacco per i miei manipoli."" Di fatto, trovò immediatamente un alloggio migliore per i suoi manipoli, ma poco dopo liquidò il parlamento. Ogni qual volta un politico getta dubbi sulla legittimità del parlamento perché non rappresenta più la ""voce del popolo"", possiamo sentire l'odore di Ur-Fascismo.

14) *L'Ur-Fascismo parla la ""neolingua"".*

La ""neolingua"" venne inventata da Orwell in 1984, come la lingua ufficiale dell'Ingsoc, il Socialismo Inglese, ma elementi di Ur-Fascismo sono comuni a forme diverse di dittatura. Tutti i testi scolastici nazisti o fascisti si basavano su un lessico povero e su una sintassi elementare, al fine di limitare gli strumenti per il ragionamento complesso e critico. Ma dobbiamo essere pronti a identificare altre forme di neolingua, anche quando prendono la forma innocente di un popolare talkshow.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I hate to break this to you, but if China actually wanted to make a move on Europe, there really isn't much America could do about it. America is in a very vulnerable position when it comes to China. If China decided to suddenly pull all of it's money and resources out of the American economy and collect on all of the debt that it has bought, America would be completely economically fucked.

No, it wouldn't. Because China would be just as fucked. And than we would be at war. Both of us. Because you know what happens when countries don't want to pay back loans or debt without the economic clusterfuck? Read up on the history of your continent by native expat, you might learn a little about somebody named Adolph Hitler who did the same thing. Here's a spoiler: It didn't go well. 

And if we're at war, believe it or not, we have EVERY REASON to go to war with China. And regardless, we would STILL GO TO WAR WITH CHINA ANYWAY OVER EUROPE, not only because of NATO, even though that's the foremost point but because the EU is our biggest trading partner, bigger than China. ;) 

&gt;No one is putting weight on your country, no one has asked for your ""protection"". Feel free to pull your bases out of our countries, we will feel free to place trade embargoes onto you like we do with every other terrorist country, and we will simply sit back and watch you eat yourselves on british television.

Actually, you did. It was called Lend-Lease. And WWII. And the Cold War. For somebody who apparently immigrated to Europe, I sure know a lot fucking more about it's history than you. Which is kinda sad, since the continent seems to be attracting well...not the sharpest tools in America's toolshed. And here's something even more surprising friend, even today, in Germany, the german citizens are PROTESTING the closure of United States' bases because of the economic prosperity it brought the local communities. 

And we're each other's largest trading partners...so uh...good luck with those sanctions"". 

&gt;The problem is that America feels that it is more important than it actually is. A more united EU would be perfectly fine on it's own, especially if we strayed from a capitalist system and set up a more socialist based economy.

Uh, we are kinda important. I mean...in the coming *""Asian Century""* and the ever-going transition to a Multi-Polar world...we'll be LESS important...but still important...and RIGHT NOW...uh...we're pretty fucking important dude..or dudet. 

And uh, you can still have your socialist economy. And you'd probably actually be able to implement it...if you know...the EU actually united and got a military together, so it could have both soft and hard power to implement that. 

&gt;Our country does not need to spend more on the military, our military is perfectly fine now and our military budget would improve greatly without America constantly dragging us into wars with third world countries. It is amazing how much money you can save when you stop blowing up innocent people for your own gain.

Uhm..yeah..it kinda fucking does. For all the reasons I listed above...which you ignored...and you're too god damn ignorant for me to repeat, though I hope you actually acknowledge and reply to them in the next reply...if you possess the mental faculties to actually accomplish that and hold a conversation. 

Oh, and Mali, Libya and Bosnia? All EUROPEAN MILITARY OPERATIONS that WE got dragged into. It goes both ways numbnuts. This factors into that whole independent military thing I mentioned before...the one where it would reduce American influence over Europe.....how it would make for a more united and influential EU.........something tells me you weren't listening.

Increasing military expenditures doesn't make you a warmonger, it just makes you not stupid. 

**TL;DR Trade embargos on the U.S. for being a terrorist country? Watching us eat ourselves on British television? You're fucking stupid as shit. Like fuck dude, I want to apologize to all Europeans for this person having immigrated over to the EU and bringing the jaw-dropping, ball-slapping retardation that she entails. But..thanks...cause we don't want her back.**

*P.S. Since you seem to be one of those American Europhiles who denounces everything about her homeland and probably refers to her past nation as AmeriKKKa.....you probably arn't going to listen to me regardless...so uh...just look at what the other EUROPEANS replied to you...or keep being fucking stupid...I don't care*",0,1371557656,null,0,false,0,cal6flz,t3_1gj3ik,t1_cal6flz,t1_cal698d,null,1430770623,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Exactly, there's no way to know how they would react. [But there is a clue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics). That's a official Russian educational textbook from a Russian Military Academy. That's what the future officer corps of Russia is studying.

Conclusion: Substantial editorializing from author of OP's article.  Paper claims that ""periphery"" (Southern) governments are held back at a political level from being able to implement reforms necessary to make their countries function normally again.  

Main reason seems to be weak executive branch / poor fiscal oversight of regions.  Other aspects of their government/constitution are mentioned in passing (such as the right to protest) but merely as descriptors, not as criticisms or obstacles. 

Far from saying that authoritarian regimes must be implemented, the paper implies that reforms to align the Southern states with the Northern ones will be needed for them to be economically successful.

Ciao, intervengo perchè nei commenti successivi ho colto molta superficialità e luoghi comuni 
riguardo quanto detto.
Non trovo corrispondenza tra i dati della polstrada con quelli presenti in letteratura dove le 
percentuali sono notevolmente diverse.
L'incompletezza e le inesattezze degli studi italiani non possono in alcun modo sottostimare il rischio del binomio alcool-guida.
Nello studio studio ACI da cui opportunamente ricavavi i dati italiani riportano percentuali ridicole: 3% degli incidenti stradali dovuto all'alcool; il dato in sè ha ben poco valore perchè ovviamente non in tutti gli incidenti è stata possibile effettuare l'alcoolmetria.
Infatti è solo in una quota degli incidenti (quelli con ferimento di persone o su chiamata dei cittadini ) in cui intervengono le forze dell'ordine. Il dato non è per nulla chiaro e sottostima l'incidenza del fenomeno.
Un dato molto più utile che garantisce la reale incidenza e gravità del fenomeno è costituito dagli studi eseguiti nel campo degli incidenti mortali o con ferimenti gravi in cui (tolti purtroppo i casi di pirateria stradale che verosimilmente portano comunque a sottostimare il 
fenomeno) l'intervento della polizia e le perizie successive sul guidatore avvengono quasi nella totalità dei casi.
Lo stesso studio ACi riporta i dati della francia in cui riporto percentuali negli incidenti 
mortali dell'ordine del 25%.

http://i.imgur.com/EgeAF4U.png

Lo stesso studio ACi nella sua scheda di approfondimento riferita all' Italia, pur confermando i 
dati dell'ordine del 2/3% fa notare che: "" Tale dato va considerato alla luce del sistema di 
raccolta dei dati durante i rilievi. In molti casi, infatti, emerge la sola violazione della 
norma di comportamento (velocità, contromano, mancata precedenza, semaforo) e non la causa 
scatenante sottostante che spesso è riconducibile all’alcol e alla droga.""

Riguardo il rapporto alcool-guida la letteratura è sufficientemente ricca per ben definire l'entità e la gravità del fenomeno ci sono almeno 600 articoli pubblicati che trattano il fenomeno a vario titolo. 
ne riporto uno recente di gennaio 2013 in cui riportano la modifica delle performance in seguito all'ingestione di alcool :http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23332180; lo studio conferma la difficoltà di ottenere dati in tal senso data la grande eterogeneità dei soggetti e delle modalità di somministrazione dell'alcool.
Altro studio recente Aprile 2012 americano http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23600629 : percentuali del 45% dei decessi FATALI positivi ad alcool e del 25 % a farmaci psicoattivi e droghe.
esistono altri studi che riportano medesime caratteristiche http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22725100.

Scopo di questo commento è semplicemente invitare almeno a non sottostimare come il binomio alcol-guida sia inscindibilmente legato e che il divieto stabilito per legge deve tener conto di variabili tali da rendere necessaria l'applicazione di un principio di precauzione.
Lo stesso principio guida moltissimi interventi che vengono messi in atto ogni giorno per salvaguardare salute e sicurezza sul lavoro, sicurezza alimentare, ambientale e sanitaria.

Why can we not have a simple discussion with differing opinions without you nerd raging and reducing yourself to a simple angry redditor that wishes only to bitch and yell rather than have an actual discourse? Come on, you can do better than senseless ranting. 

As far as China goes, your right, they would be in a shit situation as well which would lead to war which was not the point I was attempting to get across. I was simply saying that America is not this all powerful entity that protects the world from these imminent threats that are all sitting on the sidelines just waiting for America to leave so they can pounce on poor, unsuspecting Europe.

And I am perfectly aware of the history, but these are different times. The world has moved on. There is no need for a constant American military  presence in our country, and there are protests going on at least once a month to close down American military bases in the UK (due to the launching of drones from those bases). So no, it isn't one big happy bunch of Europeans begging for the bases to stay, the reaction to these things is on a country by country basis and varies accordingly.

You are right that you are ""kinda important"", America is absolutely kinda important in the global capitalist model that shapes the economy right now. I didn't say you were not important, I said you were not as important as you think you are. Yes, America is an important trading partner, but if it comes at the cost of ignoring war crimes simply for trade, then I think we would be better off without you.

I absolutely agree with your point about the EU needing to unite in all aspects in order to implement a socialist system within Europe and we are gaining support every day, but something like this would take many years to implement in my opinion, but I do feel (or hope) that it is something that is possible.

Yes, our military budget is just fine. The UK has a perfectly good military, I do not see any justifiable reason that we need to spend more on it. 

As far as the rest of your comments go, numbnuts? Amerikkka? What are you twelve? At no point have I insulted you, I simply disagreed with you.

Constitutions tend to show a strong socialist influence, reflecting the political strength that left wing parties gained after the defeat of fascism. Political systems around the periphery typically display several of the following features: weak executives; weak central states relative to regions; constitutional protection of labor rights; consensus building systems which
foster political clientalism; and the right to protest if unwelcome changes are made to the political status quo. The shortcomings of this political legacy have been revealed by the crisis. Countries around the periphery have only been partially successful in producing fiscal and economic reform agendas, with governments constrained by constitutions (Portugal), powerful regions (Spain), and the rise of populist parties (Italy and Greece).",0,1371560445,null,0,false,0,cal6z3y,t3_1gkq3k,t1_cal6z3y,t1_cal6kgu,null,1430770366,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Wow, you are so angry. Why can we not have a simple discussion with differing opinions without you nerd raging and reducing yourself to a simple angry redditor that wishes only to bitch and yell rather than have an actual discourse? Come on, you can do better than senseless ranting.

You said Europe was going to emargo America as a terrorist country and you were going to watch us eat ourselves on British television. Your discourse is fucking stupid as shit. *lmao* I shouldn't of got mad, I should be like I am now, amused. 

&gt;As far as China goes, your right, they would be in a shit situation as well which would lead to war which was not the point I was attempting to get across. I was simply saying that America is not this all powerful entity that protects the world from these imminent threats that are all sitting on the sidelines just waiting for America to leave so they can pounce on poor, unsuspecting Europe.

It was the point you were trying to get across. And you were wrong. You just can't admit it. And I never said that everybody was just waiting to pounce on ""poor old europe"" (your words). I made a point that I wasn't trying to paint boogeymen, every example I gave was backed up by facts. 

Libya, Mali, Bosnia, where have you been for the last two decades? This isn't history, it contemporary events....Mali and Libya are still on the new's for god's sakes. I mean those were EUROPEAN MILITARY OPERATIONS that were supposed to be INDEPENDENT, undertaken because of EUROPEAN WILLINGNESS, yet they dragged America in because they had to beg us for support, whether it was military, logistical or intelligence. 

A EU Military, a further integrated EU, would prevent this kind of American influence over Europe. Or...are going to just continue to be stuck to rely solely on us, and be manipulated by us accordingly, for the coming decades? Your against this....but at the same time....your for it. 

Fucking cognitive dissonance man. 

&gt;And I am perfectly aware of the history, but these are different times. The world has moved on. There is no need for a constant American military presence in our country, and there are protests going on at least once a month to close down American military bases in the UK (due to the launching of drones from those bases). So no, it isn't one big happy bunch of Europeans begging for the bases to stay, the reaction to these things is on a country by country basis and varies accordingly.

Never said it was, I only mentioned a few German towns, you were the one who painted a hyberpole-laden image of a Europe under American tyranny. You create the fantasy, I smash it down for what it is, a fantasy. 

But you're completley right. There is NO NEED FOR A AMERICAN MILITARY PRESENCE IN EUROPE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE LEAVING. Jesus, did you miss the whole 60% of the U.S. Military going to the Pacific part? But at the same time, this leaves less support for European adventures like Mali or Libya. Do you understand where I'm coming from now? 

Your country need to fill the gap left by our military. It needs to work closer with other European countries, and their militaries, to ensure shit like Mali and Libya can be independent from the U.S. like they were supposed to be, instead of reliant on us like they turned out to be. Fuck, this all happened in like the past three years...shit....this isn't history or the past...IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. 

&gt;You are right that you are ""kinda important"", America is absolutely kinda important in the global capitalist model that shapes the economy right now. I didn't say you were not important, I said you were not as important as you think you are. Yes, America is an important trading partner, but if it comes at the cost of ignoring war crimes simply for trade, then I think we would be better off without you.

You're right. We all know Russia and India and China, the only effective substitutes for completely cutting us off from trade, are completely viable alternatives. They present such a better human rights and ethical standards than us. You're right. Hell, you're pretty smart. I'm sure if you were Prime Minister and led the country down this path, it'd be in the best interest of not only your country's future, but the EU as a whole's future. 

&gt;Yes, our military budget is just fine. The UK has a perfectly good military, I do not see any justifiable reason that we need to spend more on it.

You just scrapped your only carrier, your other carrier won't be done for another couple of years, wiping a large portion of your force projection out. This would be great...if you only cared about the UK...and not Europe...but this isn't the case, because while all those other European countries got to sit under America's security umbrella and neglect their military, your country, France and the United States got to foot the defense bill. 

And you will continue to carry the entire weight of Europe's defense and military projection with France until the rest of the EU gets it's shit together. Have fun. A lot more British men are going to die this way, and a lot more British pounds are going to be spent this way. Very logical and fair to your new countrymen. 

&gt;As far as the rest of your comments go, numbnuts? Amerikkka? What are you twelve? At no point have I insulted you, I simply disagreed with you. If a simple difference of opinion over the internet gets you this upset, you should probably seek counselling for stress and anger management. I would hate to see how you deal with real world stress, sheesh.

You didn't disagree with me. You did nothing to me. You're like talking to a wall. A blind wall. Who's deaf. And substitutes it's own reality with an idealistic fantasy world completely free of reality. You don't take in what OTHERS want to do, you only consider what YOU want to do. If YOU want to pacifist, than YOU don't need a military because YOU love peace, but ethnic cleansing, extremists, old empires like Russia and two completley chaotic border regions really just don't give a fuck about you or what you want. 

And you ignore it. And you tell me it doesn't exist. And blame AmeriKKKa. And you just.....you're just stupid. And it gets under my skin so much. You disagree on emotion, you make decisions on emotion, not logic or reason. And I'm sorry, I really fucking am.

- At what point did you think I was advocating relying on America?? Also, at what point did i say that I didn't think that we should have a military, all i was saying is that we don't need to spend half of our countries budget on our military. You don't like my opinion on the matter, so what? Calm down.

- ""hyberpole-laden image of a Europe under American tyranny."" Lmao seriously?

- ""Your country need to fill the gap left by our military. It needs to work closer with other European countries, and their militaries"" I agree, I do not think that we need to devote as much spending to it as America does to it's military. Why is this so hard for you to deal with?

That's a misconception or an error in calculus. The combined secret police + police forces were less than the current police + secret services + SWAT equivalent + other adjacent authorities forces.

&gt;Stasi, at its height, had two hundred and fifty thousand people working for it at its height, controlling only 17 million people.

There you go... How do you get to that number? Well, from wikipedia:

&gt;Between 1950 and 1989, the Stasi employed a total of 274,000 people in an effort to root out the class enemy.In 1989, the Stasi employed 91,015 persons full-time, including 2,000 fully employed unofficial collaborators, 13,073 soldiers and 2,232 officers of GDR army, along with 173,081 unofficial informants inside GDR and 1,553 informants in West Germany.

Well, first off, they count the informants... but they weren't employees. They had certain advantages, but you can still do it... it's called being a concerned citizen and in the US you can go and rat out your muslim neighbour for being suspicious. Only that you don't get a better car for it. Also, it's the same as delinquents rating out their associates. Also, those informants were useful at getting criminals not only political activists. 

&gt;You could literally go to prison for making too many jokes, and it happened all the time.

You could literally not go. I can direct you to literary texts that were published during the communist regime in Romania and who were very critical of it. I can direct you to similar newpaper articles, open letters and jokes going around that time that made fun of Ceausescu, the communist party, Stalin, Russia and about anything that wore red. You can also have a look at interviews of people that did political stand up comedy. They were careful about it, implying more than saying. Toma Caragiu is an actor that did it in the 70s and on the public TV network. And I could also talk about all the shit my parents talked about the regime in public and among friends, but since they weren't important enough all they got was an interdiction to leave the country.

I think you read too many books of people that play themselves victims of communism, usually people like Kundera that made a fortune based on poor literary skills and a background of 10 years under communism.

Avversa all'immigrazione, politicamente «di destrissima», Rossella Colombo, che sogna tuttavia di emigrare a sua volta, ma «su altri pianeti, sperando di non trovare anche là quelle cacche suine di islamici», commenta così la vicenda di Dolores Valandro, la consigliera padovana espulsa dalla Lega dopo essersi chiesta, su Facebook, come mai nessuno stuprasse il ministro Kyenge: «E quando ""gli amici"" della Cécile, cioè gli islamici che seguono la legge coranica, dicono che tutte le donne bianche devono essere stuprate, cosa dobbiamo fare? Vogliamo da lei, cara ministra, una valanga di scuse per tutte noi donne bianche».


















Solidale con la collega padovana, Rossella Colombo ha immediatamente aderito al gruppo di sostegno ""Io sto con Dolores"". Lì qualcuno scrive: «A Padova, più del 50% della case sono date agli immigrati. Speriamo che arrivino al 100%, così si può fare un unico rogo». Rossella Colombo clicca ""mi piace"", ma poi ""avverte"": «Attenzione: il loro fuma inquina, essendo delle grandissime merde». «Volendo si possono sotterrare, fanno concime», è la replica di un altro.














Nato per rivendicare la ""provocazione"" di Dolores Valandro («Ha espresso, con un'immagine forte, quello che tutti pensiamo. Non ha detto: ""Spero che la stuprino"", ma solo che dovrebbe passarci anche lei per comprendere quello che si prova, dal momento che non ha fiatato per tutte le nostre donne stuprate dai suoi conterranei»), il gruppo Facebook ""Io sto con Dolores"" (3600 iscritti, ma, se ""invitati"", l'adesione è automatica) raccoglie militanti leghisti ed ex leghisti, ma anche simpatizzanti di Forza Nuova, della Fiamma tricolore o semplici nostalgici («Non c'è distinzione tra fascista e leghista, tra lombardo e siciliano. Siamo tutti uniti per una causa comune»).

Aderiscono inoltre il segretario regionale lombardo di Alba Dorata e quello di ""Alba dorata città di Marano"", il quale propone: «Vivisezionate la Kyenge come una cavia negra da laboratorio». Una galassia trasversale dell'estrema destra che, ""ironizzando"" («La Kyenge stuprata? Ma da chi? Forse da un orango arrapato»; «Difficile che un violentatore non vada così tanto per il sottile»; «Non corre quel rischio, anche se ci spero ogni giorno»), augura alla «scimmia congolese di andare sotto un camion», perché «lo stupro è troppo poco, lei e tutta la sua stirpe non sono degni di stare sulla terra»: «non ci vuole lo stupro, ci vuole il piccone», scrivono alcuni.

Uno degli amministratori del gruppo («Con Bossi, un ministro di colore clandestino non sarebbe mai passato») invita alla moderazione: «I messaggi violenti o diffamatori saranno cancellati». Taluni si mettono quindi a dibattere della «puzza delle nere» («Ci sono anche delle bianche che puzzano, ma una bianca basta che si lavi, loro invece puzzano come fogne, vadano con i ratti»), mentre altri ragionano su come fare «piazza pulita» degli immigrati: «Prendiamo tutti il manganello»; «Spariamo a vista ai gommoni»; ""Spariamo ad altezza uomo; anzi, ad altezza scimmia»; «Lanciafiamme!». Un ex membro della segreteria leghista toscana, è più pragmatico: «Quando arrivano, vanno lasciati in mare; gli altri vanno sedati come gli animali selvatici dei documentari, sparando delle punturine, si imbarcano e si rimpatriano». «Ammazziamoli tutti», taglia corto uno.

Nel gruppo, insulti e minacce anche per Said Chaibi, il 22enne consigliere di origini marocchine eletto a Treviso nelle liste di Sinistra e Libertà («Un marocchino di merda, io credo che non ci sia abbastanza benzina in Italia per tutte queste persone. Spero nasca una rivolta, oramai io sono per il sangue»); per il deputato democratico Khalid Chaouki («Tanti schiaffi a lui e alla sua razza»; «Muori bestia, marocchino di merda»; «Speriamo se ne torni a casa sua prima che ci incazziamo sul serio»), e per Mara Carfagna, che la settimana scorsa aveva condannato le parole di Dolores Valandro («Qualche negrone che violenta pure lei?»).

Tra gli iscritti, anche Diego Lorandi, dell'associazione Guerrieri padani (diverse volte ospite di Radio Padania Libera), che contesta al suo partito l'espulsione di Dolores Valandro: «Tutti i leghisti vanno difesi. Tutti, sempre! La dirigenza del politically correct ci manderà a quel paese». Della medesima opinione sono la sezione Lega Nord di Fara d'Adda («Le migliaia di adesioni a questo gruppo sono la voce della base») e altri militanti che non si spiegano come la Lega di Borghezio eGentilini possa aver espulso «chi, infischiandosene del politicamente corretto e dimostrando buonsenso, ha avuto il coraggio di dire ciò che pensa». Esplicitamente contestati il segretario federale («Maroni, impara da Dolores!») e Flavio Tosi, di cui qualcuno pubblica una vecchia foto che lo ritrae, in posa, dopo la condanna definitiva per istigazione all'odio razziale, al fianco della finta lapide dell'allora capo procuratore di Verona Guido Papalia.

Accuse alla Lega di aver «calato le braghe» anche nelle telefonate a Radio Padania Libera. «Quella è l'anima popolare della Lega, della Lega vera»; «Maroni e Tosi sono i liquidatori della Lega Nord»; «Maroni e Tosi l'hanno messa al muro», è l'opinione dei più, per i quali Dolores Valandro andava richiamata, non espulsa. Per un ascoltatore, emblema della «Lega afflosciata e rammollita» è Matteo Salvini: «Quando vedo Salvini in televisione che se ne sta in un angolo con il tablet in mano e comunica con il tablet, mentre gli altri attorno a lui picchiano i pugni sul tavolo, a me girano i coglioni».

I conduttori condannano le parole della consigliera padovana («parole deliranti, vomitevoli, ributtanti»), ma gli ascoltatori rilanciano: «Che bisogno ha la Kyenge della scorta? In fondo loro, bene o male, sono tutti uguali: se uno la vede in giro, chi va a pensare che è una ministra?». E ancora: «Non c'è mai stato un nero o una nera che abbia preso il Nobel. Traetene le vostre conclusioni» (dicendo, tra l'altro, una falsità storica). Condanna netta anche da parte di Pierluigi Pellegrin, che ogni giorno su Radio Padania conduce una rassegna stampa sui delitti commessi da cittadini stranieri (e da italiani di origini meridionali) nel nord Italia: «Io predico la libertà di linguaggio, ma davanti a quell'orrendo pensiero rimango interdetto». Pellegrin avanza però un dubbio: «Ci sono dei conti che non mi tornano, in questa vicenda, c'è qualcosa di zozzetto, qualcosa di un po' sporchino, sento puzza di bruciato, quindi eviterei di parlarne, perché, a parlarne, secondo me si fa il gioco di qualcuno che vuole manipolarci, non solo di quelli che attaccano le Lega a ogni piè sospinto, ma anche di qualcun altro, e a me questo gioco non piace».

Pellegrin allude forse a quella che, in Rete, per molti militanti di ""fede"" bossiana è una precisa accusa: Dolores Valandro era tra quanti avevano contestato Flavio Tosi nell'ultima Pontida e, cogliendo la palla al balzo, l'attuale dirigenza si sarebbe liberata di un'altra dissidente tramite quella che lo stesso quotidiano La Padania ha definito ""un'espulsione a tempo record"".",0,1371565567,null,0,false,0,cal8c59,t3_1giop7,t1_cal8c59,t3_1giop7,null,1430769725,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Ne pas assurer de redistribution quand le droit des uns empêche celui des autres (c.a.d. accès égalitaire à la propriété et à la richesse) c'est empêcher le droit le plus élémentaire qui est de pouvoir vivre décemment. 

51 % des français ne sont pas au chômage mais travail, si les salaires sont trop bas pour qu'ils puissent payer d'impôt c'est le ""marché"". Et actuellement une bonne part de la redistribution indirect (niche fiscale et autre) ne profitent qu'a la partie des français les plus riches donc ton exemple à la con....

De toute façon les libéraux vous me faites bien marrer tout ce que vous désirez c'est un pouvoir monarchique/dictatorial qui protègent seulement votre petite suffisance et votre ""bien"" le reste vous en foutez. La démocratie ça vous allait quand la pétaille votait comme vous l'entendiez, maintenant vous déguerpissez ou sapez la démocratie quand ça ne vous convient plus. Que je sache le droit de propriété reste protégé en France, si ça vous convient pas la tournure pourtant light voire droitière du govt vous pouvez tjrs voter en 2017.

J'en ai marre de travailler, je vais tout quitter et venir manger dans ton frigo. Allez, partage, c'est mon droit à la vie décente, moi aussi je veux accéder égalitairement à la richesse.

&gt; 51 % des français ne sont pas au chômage mais travail, si les salaires sont trop bas pour qu'ils puissent payer d'impôt c'est le ""marché"". Et actuellement une bonne part de la redistribution indirect (niche fiscale et autre) ne profitent qu'a la partie des français les plus riches donc ton exemple à la con....

Double cliché de gôche. Quand l'Etat fixe les règles de l'impôt, quand l'Etat gère plus de 50% de ce qui passe du patron au salarié on n'a pas le droit d'accuser le marché. Et puis le libéralisme c'est pas vraiment un truc de riches: les ennemis de mes ennemis ne sont pas mes amis; une niche fiscale sur une imposition démente n'a pas ma faveur. Pas plus que ceux qui s'enrichissent ou maintiennent leur richesse grâce aux rentes de l'Etat.

&gt; Que je sache le droit de propriété reste protégé en France

Quand je vois les paroles de mecs comme Montebourg j'en doute. Quand j'entends que le gouvernement veut taxer des revenus à 75% ça va à l'encontre du droit de propriété et de sa conséquence, le droit à disposer librement du fruit de son travail.

It's somewhat true. So what? Our constitution can be changed with a 2/3s majority and it exists to guarantee very important rights. It's also normally possible to do things in such a way as not to go against it, particularly in the case of the austerity measures that were not done due to it. This government is just incompetent and thought it could pressure the constitutional court, what happened then was failblog material for our government.  
  
Either way, we have implemented additional cost savings in other areas to compensate, because, whatever the measures we agreed with the troika, the most important thing we agreed (from their POV) is the deficit limit. In fact, we had to implement a lot more than we agreed with the troika to try and reach it, hence why they now say the harsh austerity is our governments fault as they didn't demand so much. Hipocrisy?

You raise two concerns, one of which I agree with and that's that American food tends to use low quality or untested ingredients and not say clearly on the packaging. For instance, corn syrup and GM crops. I happen to be pro GM crops, but I still think they should be labelled. I'm going to reserve judgement on that front because I believe there's a chance American's laws on food labelling might become more stringent. I will be very upset if European standards go down to facilitate this change. I don't want that to happen, but I think that the EU heads of state know this and will make the trade deal accordingly. 

Secondly, I disagree with you second point about putting European farmers out of business. If our farms are uncompetitive, then why do they exist? I'm not a fan of protectionism, ie, keeping tariffs high to protect certain industries. Our economy as a whole will be able to survive even if we're out sold in the short term. After a few years (potentially decades) our farms should become competitive again. 

@2

Fear of lobbying is a very weak criticism. US companies don't lobby any harder than EU companies and assuming otherwise without very good evidence is simply sensationalism. 

Secondly, we already get our information mined by Google, Microsoft and others. Americans blowing up Iranian oil has nothing to do with it. Are Americans going to blow up European business because we were so stupid as to let them have a free trade deal with them? No. Free trade has nothing to do with blowing up oil rigs. Free trade has very little to do with the sort of national security you're talking about. There definitely are national security issues in our modern world, but they do not come from EU-US free trade. I'm more concerned about privacy, but that also has nothing to do with EU-US trade.

@3

Debatable. I've already mentioned protectionist policies before. As I said, I am not a fan of them. However, America will also have to compete with great movies from Europe like Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes and Dr Who. It'll mostly affect the UK and Ireland (plus maybe Malta) where English is the defacto official language. Other European nations will be sheltered due to the language barrier. Again, armed raids on people's houses are pretty irrelevant. It's not completely irrelevant, but it is mostly fear mongering. 

@4

I might be wrong here, but doesn't the US prison population only create goods for the US military? I was under the impression prisoners were only used for making body armour, shell casings, ect and never for consumers goods.

@5

I don't see this problem crossing over the pond. Isn't the problem already here, anyway? We're just sheltered from it by the large scale usage of National Health Services like the NHS in the UK who buy our expensive medicines for us. 

**Lastly**

Surely, most of the problems you raise will either be countered out by them not coming to fruition or by there being other positives to free trade which out weigh the negatives?

In that thread a while back about the big differences Americans found when they traveled to Europe, many people mentioned things that people did differently in *Europe* or how restaurants functioned differently in *Europe* and ironically being a European myself I also found many of those things surprising as they are also different from what we do in my own country.  
Also when I hear generalizations of Europeans, it's similarly weird, most countries are completely different from each other so by referring to somebody as European in many instances doesn't make any sense.  
I think it may help to realize that Europeans still think of Europe in an abstract sense rather than something that they are part of (i.e. when asked nobody will say that they're from ""Europe"").

The foreign parents heard about the Schultüte, but didn´t get the candy part.

This is an incredibly unreliable way to determine things. It is seldom ever correct. For instance, to me lobbying *seems* just as bad as in the US.

So we end up thinking we're more moderate than the Americans, when in fact this has little basis in reality. 

Even if lobbying is worse there, whether lobbying is effective or not depends upon those in government.

true,kalisnap,null,null,"If you like hiking you can go to Monserrat, it's an hour train ride from Plaza Espanya.  It's a monastery nestled in the mountains and it's absolutely GOREGOUS. 

If you want to stay within Barcelona I recommend Tibidabo, the church that overlooks the city.  There is an amusement park there as well, but it's super overpriced and packed with little kids.  The church, however, gives you the ultimate panorama of Barcelona.  And the motif on the inside is stunning.  You can take a 2 euro elevator ride to the very top, which usually isn't too busy because there is also a few flights of stairs to climb up, but it's worth it.

You can visit Montjuic, where the citadel is and the Olympic Village.  Although, I prefer the hike through the gardens around the Olympic Village more.  

Camp Nou is fabulous if you like soccer/football.  There's a great museum there as well.  

Honestly, though, the best thing about Barcelona is walking through it.  Walk through Eixample up to Gracia and see all the amazing buildings and facades.  It's really incredible.  Passeig de Gracia has 2 of Gaudi's houses on it, if you are into his architecture, they are quite amazing to look at.  Casa Batllo is more amazing on the outside than inside, and El Pedrera has a great roof top.  Both cost about 17 Euro.


La Rambla isn't as pickpocket-ful as you'd think.  I've lived here for 18 months and have only seen 2 pick pocket attempts, that were done poorly, because they were caught.  I'd be careful on the metro, keep your wallet in your front pocket and hold your bags carefully and there won't be an issue.  :)

The fact that the entire UK's system of law has been built up over centuries has created an entirely different system to France's system of law or Germany's, the basics are of course the same, but the process of how it was brought up makes massive effects on the culture of that country.

California was established in 1850, it never existed before joining the US, it has no history before 1850 because it basically didn't exist. Even Poland, a country re-established after World War One has history stretching far into history and it creates a culture and a nation of people that have links that reach into the past a way the US does not.

how does being less diverse than Europe mean America is not diverse?  that's my point.

a lot of people seem to be arguing that simply because it is less diverse than Europe, that suddenly it is homogenous enough to refer to it as one culture.

there's much more to culture than a language and a flag.

the history of American states varies significantly.  Virginia is going to have quite a different culture than Washington because of their different histories.  the same can be said of Texas and Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania was one of the 13 original colonies, and played a key role in the American Revolutionary War.  Texas didn't do shit in that.

Texas was involved in a war with Mexico.  Pennsylvania may have sent some troops to help out, but the state was far away from that action and didn't change culturally from Texas' independence.

Likewise, Richmond, Virginia was the capital of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.  Washington didn't become a state until 30 years later, and played no role in the American Civil War.  They aren't going to be as culturally invested in the civil war.  

Louisiana, and the South in general, is considered the birth place of American Jazz.  You're not going to find large cultural Jazz history in North Dakota.

Alaska is a rugged frontier.  Hawaii is a tropical island.  What do they share beside a flag and a language?  Outside of American involvement in world events, they have very little in common.

Do you think you'll find a bunch of rugged, outdoors nature lovers in New York City as you would in the Pacific Northwest (or Alaska)?

This is also ignoring the immigration patterns of the US.  The midwest saw a large influx of Scandinavian immigrants.  You're not going to see much of their Norwegian-American influence in Arizona.  Similarly, you don't see as much French influence in Montana as you do in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Imagine €0.01 / £0.01 pm for voice with a standard 5GB European data for for a quarter of what you pay. Because of their buying power, corporate accounts can obtain much better deals. 

If Vodafone (or anyone else) can make money on a £0.01 pm roaming charge, I don't see why end users should be forced to pay £0.55 pm due to this lack of competition.

Also, it is important to remember that you don't need to have 10,000 handsets. Voice / Data calls have huge markups and aren't really justified unless there is something just short of a cartel between operators.

Everyone uses 1 to 6, no one uses A to F. 5 and 6 are **both** failing grades. You can compensate for 5's with a few 3's or a 2, but only for so many. You also have to compensate bad grades in Hauptfächern (major subjects) with good grades in other Hauptfächern, while bad grades in Nebenfächern (minor subjects) may be compensated with any good grade. Where I'm from (Hesse) you need two 3's or one 2 to compensate for a 5. Had to do that quite a few times myself, hehe.

While we're at it: Hauptfächer are taught 4 or 5 (rarely 6) hours per week and include German, Math and Foreign Languages (1 at Hauptschule, 1 or 2 at Realschule [you need 2 to switch to Fachoberschule or Gymnasium later], 2 or 3 at Gymnasium), as are the Leistungskurse in the Oberstufe (2 or more major subjects chosen by students upon entering the Oberstufe, usually at least one has to be natural science or a language). Nebenfächer are taught 2 or 3 (rarely 4) hours per week and are all other subjects: biology, physics, chemistry, music, art, geography, history, politics &amp; economics, ethical/religious studies and sports.

When you get to the Oberstufe you suddenly get KMK (KultusMinisterKonferenz ~ assembly of state education [among other things] secretaries) points, which range from 0 to 15:  
0 pts ~ 6 ~ F  
1 to 3 pts. ~ 5 ~ E  
4 to 6 pts. ~ 4 ~ D  
...  
13 to 15 ~ 1 ~ A
  
Oddities: Though 4 points is a D, you actually need 5 points to pass. Also 15 points is a 1+, which you can't achieve in grade 10 and lower (just as you can't achieve a 0.7 in university, see below). You need 25% of total score in a test to score 1 point and 5% more for every point above it (this is actually the same in all states), so you pass at 45% ~ 5 points.  
KMK points are not used in Berufsschule and may or may not be used in Fachoberschule (I really don't know). Ironically they switch back to number grades in university, though 5 and 6 are merged to 5 and you have .3 steppings: 5.0, 4.0, 3.7, 3.3, 3.0, ... , 1.3, 1.0

Immigrants for a large part of the European migration pre revolution moved to America (and other colonies too) to get away from politics and the like in their own country, Oliver Cromwell for one was on the verge of moving to America due to persecution by the King of England which had he, might have changed history forever. 

Later immigrants did keep some traditions, but traditions and cultures weaken when bombarded with new ones, it's why you see a lot of immigrant neighbourhoods, people like their traditions and cultures so move into smaller versions of their home countries, this of course isn't true of everyone, and is a sweeping generalisation but is true for a fair part of immigrants, *especially* in the early 20th and 19th centuries when immigration boomed.

This isn't only true of American immigrants but immigrants worldwide and in history, even Jerusalem and Acre were split into quarters, even going so far as to split up Venetians and Genoese (2 competing cities within Italy at the time) for instance.

But what I'm saying here is that whilst they may have brought traditions and cultures over, a lot of that got diluted, and yes has become American tradition. America is a country of 300 million people, of course there's going to be diversity, but there's not a long history of wars, alliances, monarchies and the like you see in Europe. Hungary and Romania dislike each other as nations, that actually embeds itself into the citizens and has done because of historical divides, France deeply hated Germany between the end of the Franco-Prusso war in 1871 to one could argue the fall of the Berlin Wall in one form or another.

Seriously, there are very few castles that are awe-inspiring by themselves (at least for me, but looking out the window I see two structures from the medieval times, so it may be different for you). Every one is different, they're fitted amazingly to and into the landscape and the are in places which make you wonder how people got all that stuff up there 500+ years ago. For me it's not about Castle X or Castle Y, it's about the castle as a place of safety, power and a remainder of a very tangible yet far away culture in the same place I stand at right then.

Immediately you see people trying to justify since Europe is more diverse.

No, but people started arguing about why it's not necessarily wrong to do so.

&gt;Pourquoi Wikipédia doit être une encyclopédie neutre/objective ? (quels sont les risques ?)

De manière pratique, le nombre de personnes/institutions qui essaient d'utiliser Wikipédia comme un plateforme d'autopromotion est impressionnant. Il y a donc déjà une nécessité pratique pour l'institution wiki d'être neutre* parce que les auteurs ne le sont pas. Par ailleurs les contributeurs à wiki sont des milliers de personnes différentes tandis que le projet est de créer UNE encyclopédie. Être neutre, avoir des règles claires et précises, surtout sur les sources, c'est ce qui permet à ce projet d'être utile, accessible, et lisible. 

&gt;Wikipédia est-elle une encyclopédie transparente ? (rôle de la transparence dans l’encyclopédie) 

Je crois que oui. Les instances de décisions sur Wikipédia (arbitrage, suppression d'articles et autres) sont accessibles à tous. Les votes pour les administrateurs et autres postes sont très ouverts. Il n'y a pas de système de messages privés, tout est accessible et archivé. Le débat principal sur la transparence quand j'étais investi portait sur IRC, le système de chat ou beaucoup de wikipédiens  (surtout des ""power users"") se retrouvent. C'est un peu obscur, pas archivé, peu accessible, etc. Ce qui nourrit les accusations (généralement ironiques mais pas toujours) de ""cabales"".

There's a reason why, if you want to find good italian food, you go to New York (Buffalo, Syracuse, New York City) or Pennsylvania.

The reason?  Because that's were most of the Italian immigrants stayed.  Their culture was incorporated into Greater America, but it wasn't lost.

There's a reason why you can find bratwursts and sauerkraut more so in the Midwest (Wisconsin, Minnesota, etc) than in the rest of the US.  Why?  Because that's where many of the German immigrants settled down.  Did everything stay the same as it was in Germany?  No, but it didn't vanish.

There's a reason why you still find lutefisk, egg coffee, and lefse being made in Minnesota, and being made by Lutherans too.   The link to Scandinavia didn't suddenly disappear once the Norwegians, Swedes, and Danish came to Minnesota.

There's a reason you can find lots of Polish and Czech food in Chicago.  Why?  Well, you can probably guess why at this point.

Immigrants stayed close to others from their homeland when they moved to the US.  This allowed them to better retain aspects of their culture (language, food, music, religion).

Perché alcuni si vestono così? Beh, a volte è una reazione al doversi nascondere. Magari sono persone che sono state o sono tuttora costrette a nascondere la propria identità ad amici e parenti, per cui quando si trovano in un'occasione in cui invece non devono nascondere nulla si sfogano. O magari sono solo esibizionisti - ma quelli non mancano in qualsiasi altro tipo di manifestazione. Il senso, comunque, non è quello di cercare consenso o dimostrarsi 'innocui', ma quello di dire ""non mi importa cosa pensi, almeno qui io sono libero di essere chi mi pare"".

Tralasciamo il crossdressing, che magari è più una cosa motivata dal voler stupire o 'trasgredire'. I transgender sono invece tutta un'altra cosa. Per quanto possa sembrare strano noi abbiamo - grosso modo - 3 'parametri' sessuali più o meno indipendenti: quello che si vede (sesso biologico), quello che ti piace (orientamento sessuale), e quello che ti senti di essere (identità di genre). Di norma il sesso biologico coincide con l'identità di genere: sei uomo e ti senti uomo o sei donna e ti senti donna, a prescindere da cosa ti piaccia. In alcuni casi non è così: nasci con un corpo maschile, ma il cervello è settato su 'femmina', o viceversa. Queste persone si sentono al 100% uomo o donna, ma il corpo non corrisponde a come loro si percepiscono, per cui tentano di sopperire con l'abbigliamento e, quando possibile, con terapie e procedure mediche che consentano loro di allineare il più possibile il loro corpo alla loro identità. Non è una questione di esibizionismo o esagerazione: è proprio una intima convinzione/consapevolezza di avere il corpo sbagliato, e non è affatto semplice conviverci.

This is pretty interesting, cause it's so different from how our national identity was born. We spoke our own and different language than our neighbours.

I think through-out Europe language has been the first and foremost reason for a national identity. That's not really the case with the Anglosphere at all.",0,1371616944,null,0,false,0,calqr34,t3_1gler3,t1_calqr34,t1_calmz0e,null,1430760831,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7
