true,madison817,null,null,"from the research that i've done (i'm planning a long-term trip to italy myself!), our best bet is teaching english in some form and you will need certification for sure. working with an institution means you'll likely get contract positions and decent consistent pay. you can also conduct private/group lessons that you organize on your own. but personally the more i research this the more i feel it will take away from my experience there (i am enrolled in an italian language course there, also i want to spend weekends travelling to other parts of italy).

so my next option is service industry, but italy is highly unilingual and their service expectations is much higher than north america. so things like retail or fast food, i find it unlikely they would hire us just because we would interact with the language more frequently.

so what is left are highly touristic areas. so really, things like being a tour guide or working in hostels (but they'd pay you with free accommodation). my plan is to try working as a bartender in hostels or any non-traditionally italian restaurant, or work as a freelance writer online (elance, odesk, fiverr... etc), or being a nanny.

the main thing to know is that most if not any jobs we are likely to get are often obtained by making those connections in person (as opposed to planning ahead and from afar). and a lot of it has to do with who you know, so make connections with friends in italy (like expatslivinginrome fb group). and lastly, getting a job anywhere for &gt;90 days requires a work permit, so apply really early. apparently those take a while!",0,1386486720,null,0,false,0,cdwg755,t3_1oa3t3,t1_cdwg755,t3_1oa3t3,null,1428343964,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

Why people stand up on official occasions when people shout ""Bierut! Bierut!""? To not sit (in Polish slang it also means to not go to jail).



Priest had a parrot that always said ""Kill Stalin"". Eventually somebody heard it, told someone else and the priest was in the court. The priest tried to persuade the judge that it was the parrot not him, but the parrot wasn't speaking. First the priest asked the parrot ""&gt;Kill Stalin&lt;"", then the judge, then the whole room. Then the parrot sings ""Lord Jesus, hear us, how the people are begging"" (line from a very popular Polish Church song).

«Ciao, ci tengo ad informarti che a partire da lun 9 dic l’Italia tutta si fermerà e scenderà in piazza per riprendersi la sovranità nazionale. E una protesta pacifica (non si rompe nulla) ma ad oltranza. Agricoltori e camionisti paralizzeranno gli svincoli stradali nevralgici per paralizzare gli introiti della Casta Politica proprio in un periodo dell’anno dove “con l’iva al 23%” i ladri ed assassini al parlamento si aspettano grandi entrate. (non pagare tasse adesso). Continuerà invece l’economia essenziale (cibi e medicine x la popolazione). Il mio consiglio dunque è quello di non usare mezzi (disagio avvisato è mezzo Agio) e magari di partecipare ad un evento che rimarrà nella storia della nostra grande nobile e bella Italia. Polizia e forze dell’ordine sono stati avvisati e sono dalla nostra parte … (d’altronde hanno giurato fedeltà alla costituzione ed al popolo Italiano).

true,1632,null,null,"Ich werde mit meiner Partnerin zu meiner Familie fahren. Dort feiern wir mit meinen Eltern und der Familie meines Bruders. Seine drei Töchter machen die Feiertage meist recht interessant. Meist treffen wir dort am 23. ein. 

Nachdem alle eingetroffen sind essen wir zunächst [Dresdner Christstollen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresdner_Christstollen) und trinken dazu Kaffee. Alternativ hat meine Mutter stets auch Mohnstollen im Angebot. Da wir alle mehrere hundert Kilometer voneinander entfernt leben, tauschen wir zunächst Neuigkeiten aus...


Am Morgen des 24. gibt es stets ein sehr opulentes Frühstück. Neben zahlreichen deutschen und französischen Käsesorten tischt uns meine Mutter zumeist auch mindestens vier verschiedene Sorten Schinken, diverse Wurstarten, sowie zahlreiche Marmeladen auf. Zumeist stehen ca. ein halbes Dutzend verschiedene Brötchensorten, sowie diverse Brotsorten und frisch gepresster Orangensaft auf dem Tisch. Zehn Personen wollen verpflegt sein. *s


Am Heiligabend werden wir zunächst gegen 18 Uhr mit allen Kindern Beschehrung feiern, ein oder zwei Lieder singen und dann unsere Geschenke auspacken. Meine Freundin behauptet immer, dass das Auspacken der Päckchen bei uns chaotisch verläuft, denn alle reißen gleichzeitig das Geschenkpapier von den Paketen. In ihrer Familie läuft das angeblich zivilisierter ab. 

Das Haus meiner Eltern ist stets sehr feierlich geschmückt. Überall stehen kleine Porzelanengel, Nußknacker, Holzfiguren aus dem Erzgebirge, elektrisch oder mit Kerzen betriebene handgeschnitzte Figurenensembles, sowie jeder erdenkliche andere Schnickschnack. Der Weihnachtsbaum bordet über vor lauter Glaskugeln, Sternen, Kerzen und Lichterketten. Meine Mutter ist ein großer Weihnachtsfan.


Zu diesem Zeitpunkt öffnen wir meistens ein oder zwei Flaschen Champagner. Zugleich tauchen nach und nach meist kleinere Quengeleien auf, da abgesehen von meiner Mutter und meinem Bruder, alle Erwachsenen fröhliche Heiden sind die sich insgeheim über den celebrierten Mythos amüsieren, den Kindern zuliebe jedoch die Fassade aufrecht erhalten (außer meiner Freundin, die arbeitet für den Papst).

Im Anschluß gibt es in unserer Familie traditionell Würstchen mit Kartoffel- und zumeist auch Krabbensalat. Ich esse seit diesem Jahr kein Fleisch mehr, daher bin ich gespannt wie ich kulinarisch durch die Feiertage kommen werde. *g


Nach dem Essen öffnen wir in der Regel die ein oder andere Flasche Rotwein und wir gehen zum gemütlichen Teil des Abends über.


Am Morgen des Ersten Weihnachstfeiertages gibt es erneut das gaaanz große Frühstücksprogramm. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt stellt sich in der Regel, langsam aber sicher, ein Gefühl permanenter Übersättigung ein.

Am späten Vormittag beginnen bei einem Glas Sekt die Vorbereitungen für das Mittagessen. Unser traditionelles Familienmenü besteht aus Gans (selten auch Truthahn), Klößen, Kartoffeln, Blaukraut, Maronen und Rosenkohl. Als Dessert serviert mein Stiefvater, der es sich einmal im Jahr nicht nehmen läßt selbst zu kochen, in der Regel Vanilleeis mit verschiedenen Beeren.

Nach dem Mittagessen ist der eher formelle Teil der Feiertage vorbei und wir genießen (der eine mehr, der andere mittlerweile schon weniger) unser Zusammensein. Gegen 4 Uhr trinken wir häufig einen Kaffee und essen erneut Stollen und Kuchen. Manchmal nerven wir uns. So wie es wohl in den meisten Familien bei tagelangen Festen zugeht ...

Am nächsten Vormittag werden wir nach einem weiteren Schlemmerfrühstück, mindestens ein Kilo schwerer und häufig mit leichtem Kopfweh, wieder in Richtung Heimat aufbrechen und uns im Auto bereits Gedanken über Sylvester machen.

Wo genau soll da meine falsche Schlussfolgerung sein? Bei deinem Absatz geht es doch auch nicht um Themen sondern nur um Kriege zwischen Persönlichkeiten. Sprich: die Themen waren OK. Es ist an den Persönlichkeiten gescheitert.

Tatsächlich hat die Weisband gezeigt wie unnütz diese Persönlichkeitendebatte wirklich ist. Sie ist gegangen wegen irgendwelchen Faschisten innerhalb der Partei. Nicht wie du schriebst, weil man ihr nicht genug gezahlt hat. Das hatte nichts mit den Themen zu tun. Hätte man sie (die Jeanne d' Arc der Piraten) nicht auf einen solchen Thron gesetzt, wäre sie und die Partei nicht so tief gefallen als es plötzlich um einige wenige Vollidioten ging die aber ebenfalls nichts mit dem Programm zu tun hatten. 

&gt; Dann würd ich mir nochmal angucken wie die Kommissare ernannt werden, wirklich undemokratisch ist das auch nicht.

Ich habe nicht geschrieben, dass es undemokratisch ist. Ich sagte, es sei das Gremium welches am wenigsten demokratisch legitimiert ist. 

Wiki schreibt: 
&gt; Das Ernennungsverfahren der Europäischen Kommission wird häufig als Teil des Demokratiedefizits der Europäischen Union angesehen, da sie – anders als eine nationale Regierung, die direkt vom Parlament gewählt wird – nur indirekt über die Regierungen der Mitgliedstaaten legitimiert ist und das Europäische Parlament bei der Ernennung lediglich begrenzte Mitspracherechte hat.

??

&gt; Wo isn bitte das Problem, wenn ich sag ""die Inhalte der Spd sind geil und Steinbrück is auch einfach n Geiler"".

Nirgendwo. Vor allem nicht wenn du für BILD oder Explosiv arbeitest. DA ist die ""Geilheit"" eines Kandidaten sicher sogar messbar. Mit Regieren hat das eher wenig zu tun.

&gt; Wir haben schließlich eine verkackte repräsentative Demokratie und keine Basisdemokratie. 

Eine repräsentative Demokratie Deutschlands bedeutet eben nicht, dass sich das Volk nun plötzlich mit einem Idealisten abgeben muss welcher irgendwelche idiotischen Ideen hat und diese dann durchgesetzt bekommt einfach nur weil er ""geil"" ist. Es kann eben keiner von denen einfach irgendwas entscheiden. Die Entscheidungen werden von der Partei getragen und die Partei kann spätestens bei den nächsten Wahlen dafür abgestraft werden.

Ich rede auch nicht von direkter Demokratie sondern davon dem Parlament, dem Gremium welches näher am Volk ist, den Grossteil der Macht zu geben. Da hast du noch immer keine direkte Demokratie aber es ist einfach reprästentativer. 

&gt; Und das ist auch gut so, das Volk ist eben auch eine Gewalt die man im politischen System begrenzen muss.

Du meinst also das Parlament hat gar nicht zu viel Macht? 

Das würde natürlich die ganze Diskussion überflüssig machen. Ich ging bisher davon aus, dass du der 2. Hauptaussage zustimmst. Tust du das nicht, habe ich eigentlich nur meine Zeit verschwendet. 

&gt; Als ob da jetzt nur Scheiße laufen würde in der Kommission. Der einzige Fehler der gemacht wurde, is der dass das Parlament keine Gesetzesinitiative hat und den Lobbyistenfuzzis in der Kommission Tür und Tor offen steht.

Jo. Ist ja auch fast gar nichts....

Das ist es doch. Es ist doch auch für einen Lobbyfutzi einfacher (und billiger) eine Persönlichkeit zu schmieren als eine Partei. 

&gt; Aber auch wenn wirtschaftliche Interessen teilweise über den Volkswillen gestellt wurden (Andere Themenfelder dagegen nciht unbedingt negativ beeinflusst wurden): Wo kann die Kommission denn den europäischen Gedanken nicht stärker vorantreiben?

Was ist den der europäische Gedanke? Eine demokratieentschlackte Junta von geschmierten Persönlichkeiten?

&gt; Sagen wir also, Schmidts ""persönlichkeit"" wäre als öffentlichkeitswirksamen Gesicht (zb über verbreitung in Medien) praktisch der Bundespräsident der EU. Keine tatsächliche Macht, aber er gibt dem ganzen ein Gesicht.

Es gibt halt weder einen Bundespräsidenten der EU noch ist davon auch nur irgendwo die Rede. Tatsächlich haben wir aber einen Präsidenten der Europäischen Kommission dessen Position nicht annähernd so nutzlos ist. Das ist auch die Person von der Schmidt u.a. gesprochen haben kann. 

&gt; Fazit: Wo hast du das Problem, ""Persönlichkeit"" direkt mit ""Führerr"" zu asozieren? Ist Gauck ein ""Führerr""? Oder Merkel? Oder Steinbrück? Nooope.

Gauck ist eine nutzlose Sockenpuppe der keine Entscheidungen trifft.

Merkel repräsentiert eine vom Volk gewählte Regierung.

Steinbrück? Der Clown vom letzten Herbst? Was ist mit dem?

Still, it's nice to know that we're finally addressing the issue, and we've been pretty successful I'd say.

* It gets better, more than 1.7 tons of narcotics have been destroyed in a thermal plant in Obrenovac. [pic](http://i.imgur.com/EVgYkAv.jpg) The Prime Minister pointed out that this is the first drugs destruction in 14 years.

* Interim mayoral elections in Fót was court ordered to be repeated due to gross violations of campaign silence rules. This is the second major embarrasment for the Socialists in a short time, after  their former communications director published a doctored video as evidence for an alleged voting fraud in Baja in a similar election.[[1]]( http://www.politics.hu/20131202/court-orders-mayoral-election-repeat-in-fot/) 

* Gross minimum wage to reach 6 digits: it will be 101.500HUF in 2014.  For someone ineligible for tax breaks, that will be 66.500HUF net or about 220€. The total tax contributions (employee+employer) tied to this salary will nearly match the net amount, because hey, we’re  totes rich like Denmark. [[2]]( http://www.politics.hu/20131202/minimum-wage-to-rise-in-2014)

* The Tax Leaks scandal continues, but nothing major this week. PM Viktor Orbán said in a radio interview: „Everyone in Hungary is aware that major tax evasion is ongoing.  We don’t know about any documents [supplied by whistleblower András Horváth], so there is no need for a special investigation.” He also said „The place of all tax evaders is in prison.” and the nation wholeheartedly appreciated the Great Leader’s humor.

* Hungary slipped to 47th on the Corruption Perception Index.  The Transparency of Government policy making sub-index puts us at 132 out of 148 on par with Mali, Iran and Algeria. Government response was „Lol, we don’t care, this is stupid.” [[5, needs signup]]( http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/12/03/hungary-blooms-but-corruption-remains/)

* We also slipped in the PISA rankings, ranking well below OECD average. People were especially hurt by our big drop in the mathematics section, since we like to perceive ourselves as hard science/STEM oriented and think humanities are for ~~girls~~ ~~liberals~~ ~~Jews~~ burger flippers. Government response was: „Other countries suck too, so it’s okay” and „This is all the Socialists’ fault, they destroyed the public education during their reign” [[6]]( http://www.politics.hu/20131203/hungarian-students-rank-below-oecd-average-in-tests/)

* A well-covered drunk driving case had its first instance judgement read 2 weeks ago to national uproar (she got 6 years, but discounting the custody time and assuming good behavior she can be out in a little over 2 years). She spent 1,5 years in pre-trial custody and now that her case turned to appeal she asked for a house arrest, the request was granted. Since the family is rather rich, they rented two apartments for her in a fairly upscale apartment complex and idiots got upset seeing the photos of the place, because apparently rich people deserve poorer treatment for being rich. Naturally bonus hate is given to her for being Slovak and for the hazy details of the case (she may have been high on prescription meds, drunk, both or neither). A prominent member of Fidesz (who is known for his liking of luxury items)  spoke out against the house arrest IN FRONT OF THE APARTMENT COMPLEX on Tuesday, by evening she was back in custody after the ruling allowing house arrest was magically turned around. People truly wonder why did we place 132/148 on the government transparency index.  [[8]]( http://www.politics.hu/20131205/slovak-drunk-driver-sentence-triggers-exchange-over-judicial-independence)

* We are a whiny bunch, no surprise there. A recent Gallup poll puts us at 4th place tied with Haiti on the self-perceived suffering list. Our GDP, by far the highest of the top8, is 19.496$, 5th Madagascar’s is 945. Nearly one-third of all Hungarian responders picked „suffering” as the state of their current and future lives. We are ahead of Afghanistan and Iraq as well...  [[9]]( http://www.gallup.com/166076/suffering-bulgaria-armenia-highest-worldwide.aspx)

* The 500.000th ethnic Hungarian took his citizenship oath in the Parliament. He was a well known Francisian monk who is running an NGO for orphans in Romania.  The date of the oath, 5 December, was not chosen randomly, it was the 9th anniversary of the failed [2004 dual citizenship referendum]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_dual_citizenship_referendum,_2004). Leftists are saying Fidesz is practically buying bonus votes to cement themselves in power in the upcoming elections, as these new citizens are thought to be mostly right supporters.

* PM Orbán visited Macedonia, President Áder was in Kuwait. 

* A gay-themed movie was released this week to the dislike of LGBT groups. The main (gay male) character turns straight after bruising his head, comedy (with a lot of tits and stereotypical gay jokes) ensues. They say the movie unwittingly supports the anti-gay mindset of the common people.  The €900k state funding of the film exceeds the total annual funding of all LGBT groups in the country.  

* A bear approached our border from Serbia. He had no passport so the patrol scared him back. 

* Our top tier police/SWAT team botched a raid and after apprehending the suspect one team member accidentally discharged his weapon, which hit another team member in the tigh. He is recovering. 

* Katinka Hosszú won European Swimmer of the Year award, after a truly asskicking season. She won the short track FINA World Cup series with 55 medals (32 gold) and 840 points in rankings over second placed Alia Atkinson’s 288, earning nearly $400k in prizes. Her last competition of the year is next week, the short course European Championship in Denmark. 

* The women’s handball team is competing at the World Championship in Serbia, official expectations are the quarter finals, while players and fans are dreaming of a top3 finish in case of both top performance and a lucky draw. Yesterday we won our first game against the Czech 35-27.

The script itself isn't difficult, you just need to practice writing it a lot. Like you most likely did when you first learned how to write in your mother tongue/- script. People nowadays can't even write proper 'regular' script for simple lack of practice. The gorgeous handwriting you see in old letters comes from people who most likely wrote several of those per day.

As for reading, I imagine it would be immensely difficult for a non-native speaker, since you wouldn't be familiar with many words and expressions used 100+ yrs ago. Even for me it's difficult because even though I know certain expressions my brain isn't expecting them to pop up. You often only read the first few letters and you subconsciously fill in the rest, because there are only so many different combinations of letters that would make sense. If there are many unfamiliar expressions in the text it's much more time consuming, i.e. a modern newspaper article transcribed into Kurrentschrift would be much easier to read than one from 1910.

Germany benefits from the single currency by having its natural foriegn exchange rate suppressed by the wider currency region. Its goods are cheaper, but by the same token it raises the exchange rate for the wider currency region. Making their goods more expensive.

And do so whilst engaging in none of the normal solidarity acts that nation states engage in to normalise wealth potential within regions:

Federal US taxation is ~25% of GDP and the variation in spending levels between rich and poor states is ~5% of GDP, so a variation of roughly 20% of federal spending.

How big a budget would the EU need to be able to slosh around 5% of combined GDP into the poor regions (bearing in mind the current budget is only 1% (and heavily constrained by CAP payments)?

The other point is that americans accept this, they are all american, whereas we are rapidly finding out just how german the germans are, and finnish the finns are, when it comes to firehosing cash at nations they consider to be essentially delinquent! In the UK this ‘sloshing’ occurs in the form of:

a) National pay-bargaining which benefits poorer regions (teachers, nurses, etc)

b) National social benefits more generous than poorer regions could afford alone (eg.housing benefit in glasgow)

c) Targeted regional development grants/discounts to encourage business growth (objective 1 EU/WEFO funds)

d) Additional infrastructure spending to support the local economy (the mainland-skye bridge)

e) Operating national services hubs from depressed regions to boost wages (DVLA in swansea, etc)

Unless Germany recognises the ‘familial’ relationship, and the obligation that goes along with that, then it needs to leave for the good of its neighbours.

This principal applies equally to the netherlands and finland, but since it is Germany that is the driving economic power for the euro’s sake the answer must be ‘right’.

One mechanism to equalise this foriegn exchange disparity would be eurobonds. To compensate for a higher than natural foriegn exchange rate the wider currency union would borrow collectively, and thus lower their borrowing costs on the back of Germany’s strength.

The quid-pro-quo would be that Germany’s cost of borrowing would rise, as it too would be borrowing through the wider currency union and would see its strength diluted in consequence.

Premettiamo anche, per mettere tutte le carte in tavola, che io sostengo da anni che l'idea di Ichino, sposata da Renzi, di come portare la flexicurity in Italia mi sembra una tavanata mostruosa e pericolosissima.

Andiamo ai dettagli:

&gt; Il contratto di transizione istituisce un’agenzia, in forma di ente bilaterale o consortile, o anche solo di “sportello aziendale”, a cui viene affidata dalle imprese stipulanti la gestione congiunta dell’assicurazione contro la disoccupazione e dei servizi di riqualificazione e assistenza intensiva nella ricerca del nuovo posto per i lavoratori licenziati.

Carrozzone che deve gestire somme enormi in regime misto pubblico\privato = festa grande per tutti coloro che ci vorranno mangiare. In Italia, con questo livello di corruzione, non è realistico.

&gt; L’agenzia stipula un contratto di ricollocazione con il lavoratore licenziato, che

&gt;   gli garantisce un’indennità complementare di disoccupazione che porta il totale al 90% dell’ultima retribuzione per il primo anno, digradante del 10% in ciascuno dei tre anni successivi (durata max pari a quella del rapporto di lavoro intercorso detratto il primo anno, con il limite di quattro anni);

Ovvero esiste un forte incentivo a tenere il personale non qualificato per meno di un anno, in modo da non dovergli pagare l'assegno supplementare di disoccupazione (il personale qualificato è parzialmente protetto perché all'azienda costa assumere e formare).

&gt; Il finanziamento delle attività di riqualificazione e collocamento è sostenuto dalla Regione, col contributo del Fondo Sociale Europeo.

**Questo è il punto peggiore**. Questo è il punto in cui Ichino dice ""i soldi per pagare questa cosa verranno...dalle puffabacche"". Dove li prendono le regioni, dissanguate da decenni di tagli, i soldi per istituire un costoso sistema di riqualificazione professionale? come è pensabile, poi, che le molte regioni perennemente in rosso possano permettersi questa ennesima spesa? boh, non si sa.

&gt; Il finanziamento del trattamento di disoccupazione è a carico dell’impresa che licenzia.

E che quindi, come dicevo prima, ha un incentivo a liberarsi dei lavoratori con scarse qualifiche entro un anno. Anzi, visto che questi abusi già succedono sono sicuro che moltissime aziende licenzierebbero il 31 dicemebre per riassumere il 2 gennaio, in modo da poter evitare la maturazione del diritto al trattamento di disoccupazione. Bello no?

&gt; Licenziamento entro i primi sei mesi di servizio: costo zero

&gt; Entro il primo anno: una mensilità di preavviso o indennità di licenziam.

&gt;  Alla fine del secondo anno: due mensilità + contratto di ricollocazione max un anno di sostegno del reddito (costo medio: 25% r.a.l.; max 65% r.a.l.)

E qui Ichino mi da ragione. Licenziare entro il primo anno ha una convenienza *enorme* per l'azienda, che deve pagare al massimo una mensilità; se aspetta più di un anno invece gli tocca pagare due mensilità più svariati mesi di sostegno al reddito.

**tl;dr** La proposta è imbecille perché 1) non ci sono i soldi per finanziare i centri di riqualificazione professionale (""Verranno dalle regioni e dai fondi europei"" non è un piano di budget valido) 2) si crea un gigantesco incentivo a non tenere dipendenti per più di un anno.",0,1386506094,null,0,false,0,cdwjs4f,t3_1sdf9j,t1_cdwjs4f,t3_1sdf9j,null,1428342219,10,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,10

Yes, the government and its media have been saying that a lot. It doesn't feel like a recovery exactly.

I didn't talk about last month unemployment figures because I didn't find good sources in english.

* The spanish social security lost 66,829 members in November. [Link](http://www.expansion.com/2013/12/03/economia/1386057898.html)
* However, The registered unemployment has fallen for first time in November since 1996, 2 476 persons. [Link](http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2013/12/03/529d8d6b0ab740d2318b4571.html)

However, the reason for the fall in unemployment doesn't seem to be related with a recovery, it seems more related with the following factors:

* Just 60% of the unemployed are paid unemployment benefits or subsidies.
* The emigration is in record figures. This year we are going to be the EU country with the biggest emigration around 240,000 persons(take that Romania).
* The people don't see the point in registering in the public unemployment. The normalized EU figures are around 6 millions, but the public unemployment services have registered 5 millions of jobless.
* People delaying their incorporation to the labour market with more education.


It seem that we are starting an age of stagnation and/or slow growth. A government agency has made two forecast:

* We will lose 2.5 millions of inhabitants due to emigration. [Link](http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np813_en.pdf)
* We will create 1.7 millions of jobs in the next 20 years(this is older and it will be changed soon, because the emigration is being higher than expected [Link](http://i.imgur.com/vKT6w5I.png)

However, one thing that I came across a while ago which I think is quite interesting, is going back to the idea of setting up further devolved regions within England itself. 

Keep the Welsh and Northern Irish Assemblies and the Scottish Parliament, then turn England into its regions and instead of going 'West Midlands' and 'North West' etc, split it up into their regions and base it off the [historical Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that were here](http://www.jpkc.sdu.edu.cn/culture/final/contents/content7_img89.jpg).

So you could then have areas such as Mercia, Wessex, and even Cornwall. Devolved from London itself and loosely related by a federal government of Westminster and so they can therefore be better managed for the people.

I think those regions still apply today in ways, like with the North and Midlands.

Keep the counties the same and it can be the next level below the region. So, you can have Shropshire Council tending to the needs of the areas within that county, underneath the region of Mercia, and then you have the federal government at Westminster having certain powers over all of them, whatever they may be.",0,1386514936,null,0,false,0,cdwldwu,t3_1scl67,t1_cdwldwu,t3_1scl67,null,1428341470,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Certo, ma il potere di questo principio secondo me è sopravvalutato: o esiste un *forte* incentivo economico a rispettare le regole (ovvero il sistema, a prescindere dalle sanzioni, funziona in modo tale che *ti convenga di più rispettare le regole*), oppure è fondamentale che il rischio insisto nei comportamenti illeciti sia elevato.

Personalmente non ho visto proposte di legislazione del lavoro che ci metterebbero nel primo caso, dunque rimango convinto del ruolo fondamentale di ispettorati e giudici.

There isn't a great societal debate nor a great political debate about it. It's 99% show and there was and is a parliamentary majority for this legislation. But coalition loyalty with the CSU prevents it from being passed.

The problem with weighing the cost of political representation is it cannot be given any monetary value. Like health, it's worth whatever you do with it, and kinda nice on its own. Putting a price tag on it does it a disservice. As workers found out at the beginning of the 20th century, paying a union fee is worth the extra organization and the greater voice. Selling any political representation as too expensive is, very subtly, class warfare.

So I'll try to explain how all of my foreign language classes have been thus far and if I need to elaborate, I will. 

We've used the same German textbook for all of these classes (Kontakte) and we basically treat foreign language like it's a giant puzzle to put together. 

For example, one of my latest assignments looked like this: 

die Messer/ die silbernen Löffel/liegen/rechts neben

das Weinglas/ das saubere Wasserglas/stehen/neben 

etc. 

The point of the assignment was to put the sentence in order and make sure we had the correct case for the noun at the end. We were never asked to translate what it said, just to make sure that it was written correctly. 

It isn't that my professor is intentionally holding us back from experiencing the language, it's just that she doesn't have time to let us express our own thoughts and correct us when we misuse something. 

We meet twice a week and there's over 40 of us. 

I ""understand"" the rules of German when you feed me my lines, so to speak, but I want to express my own thoughts and have you guys correct me so I can actually see how these rules work in practice.

The reason I think we need to weigh this cost is because, as you said earlier, ""there is a sweet spot"". Neither of us would be in favour of adding in another ten layers of government. And neither of us would want to get rid of all of them. Both of us agree that there is a sweet spot. The discovery of that sweet spot is something we are both seeking to do : and part of that discovery involves an assessment of benefits and costs, whether these benefits and costs are economic or otherwise.

* Turkish students enter several university exams, and because the schools are not enough to prepare them, they go to prep schools. (Also, the university exam system changes once every few years.) It is basically impossible to go to a good/average university without spending at least 2 years in these prep schools. Some are controlled by religious groups, some not. Due to the disagreement between Erdoğan and the Gülen movement, it has been proposed that these prep schools be closed. This is ridiculous, until the schools are better or the exams are fairer they have no right to shut them down.The prep schools are an indirect tool for the argument, it seems, and the students have to bear the inconveniences.

Only you'll notice that over time in the UK membership of political parties has decreased massively. Trust in parliament and politicians in general is at an all time low, the public are disengaging from politics and voting because they believe that voting has no significant effect on their lives, that irrespective of who they vote for nothing much will change, so why bother?

So trying to convince them that adding more politicians at the regional level is going to somehow make their lives better hasn't and isn't likely to work. You have to offer them something new, something that doesn't look like a variation of the same old system which they're thoroughly disillusioned with.

*shakes fist*

&gt; If you can't afford much better, why don't you get a different job? Or move to a place where these costs are much lower?

Ok, I'm currently undergoing an education, but that statement needs correcting. Finding a new job or moving to a place where the costs are lower is expensive. To find a new job you must actually have the time to do so and the ability to move, something which not everyone has, and the job market has been a bit shit for a lot of folk lately. As for moving in general, it costs you to move, to stay somewhere while you find a place, to stay in that place while you find a job, to do so while unemployed, and generally if you move somewhere cheap, it's probably cheap because there is hardly any work.

&gt;I don't understand when people complain about their choices.

Any meaningful life choice is a luxury to most people. Why do I complain? To hopefully to get an agreement on a shared grievance and because its the first step to making things better .

&gt;The reason I think we need to weigh this cost is because, as you said earlier, ""there is a sweet spot"".

Ok, I see your point. There has to be some sort of ""political representation test"". But I can't really say that anyone has political representation in the local elections, and thus anywhere below Westminster. The councils are quite honestly a joke in administration and representations, and Westminster gives them hardly any supervision so they get away with a lot, and in return the councils have hardly any say in Westminster.
&gt;Questionning the benefit of additional representation is not class warfare.

  Questioning the cost might be. ""We can't afford representation"" are sad words. But I would say that as long as redundancy and choke points are avoided, representation and organisation are always desirable.  

&gt;But, as I have said earlier, the people that are best placed to meet the costs and assess the benefits are those people from Yorkshire.

The challenge as I see it, is that those in England have been convinced that they don't need it, largely through ill-education. With the exception of London which confidently took on the GLA for itself. 

In my more dire moods I'm prone to thinking that anyone who has any good sense and a thimble of enlightened self-interest goes to London, and London's political structure shows it.

&gt; It is literally a form of prison. In fact, there's a name for it:

&gt; The Panopticon is a type of institutional building designed by English philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham in the late 18th century. The concept of the design is to allow a single watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution without them being able to tell whether they are being watched or not. Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that all inmates must act as though they are watched at all times, effectively controlling their own behavior constantly. 

Everything is a form of prison as long as you're thinking like an ape creature. Countries are prisons, they make you control your own identity. Roads are prisons, they make you control your own locomotion. Houses are prisons, they make you control your own daily routine and lifestyle. The plethora of canons regarding all aspects of art and human expression is a prison, it makes you regulate the way you express yourself. Language is a prison, it makes you regulate your own communication. Being a social organism is a prison, it makes you regulate your own interactions with other people.

On the other hand I can't help but think a prostitution license would be a better solution, since it would require the person to present themselves to the authorities and it makes it easier to distinguish between the supervised and the exploitative, and I think the current mindset prevents such a measure, people rather wanting to wash their hands of the whole thing.

Glory To Ukraine!  
(Crowd) Glory to our Heroes!  
Glory to the Maidan!  
Fellow Ukrainian brothers and sitters, today the government has betrayed us, Yanukovich didn't only betray us by oppressing us on the national level. Not only by taking away our rights as citizens, ruining social rightness, ruining the Ukrainian economy, but today they fell on their knees in front of Putin, in front of Kremlin. They are giving Ukraine to Moscow. Will we let this happen?!!  
(Crowd) No!!!  
Do we want to be in the Soviet Union?  
(Crowd) No!!  
We Ukrainians are a European country and we fight for our future. And Ukraine is..  
(Crwd) Europe!  
Ukraine is..  
(Crwd) Europe!  
Ukraine is..  
(Crwd) Europe!  
Today they have some kind of meeting in Sochi. We demand them to tell us what are these secret meeting, what will be the effect of these meetings? Putin and Yanukovich the Ukrainian people must know. They can't do this behind the back of the nation. They are pulling us into repression, the times of Stalin and the government here is trying to go back to the time of Stalin. Look what they are doing! They are arresting people for no reason. Then they put bags over the arrested peoples faces. What is this? Dozens of people are disappearing from the maidan without anyone knowing. They are breaking all the procedures as to detaining people.

many, but far from all. But so are many many employees in the Netherlands so I don't see your point - are you implying all those employees can also not seek any help? And they can certainly find help, you know why? because it's legalised and their profession is not punishable, is the police dealing with these actions the way they should be? well, no local governments (and banks and tax agencies in a lesser extent) are doing everything they can to make live for a prostitute a hell and that has it's consequences. . 

&gt;And of course banning prostitution will not stop prostitution. Banning rape, murder, and slavery didn't stop any of those crimes either. But at least we can do something about it when we find out!

Nice, your comparing a victimless crime with one where there is. And your saying we can't do anything about sex trafficking or forced prostitution? we can, because unlike prostitution those are still very illigal. And because legalising prostitution brings them to the open we should be able to find them a lot faster.

&gt;Surely, the right not to be a prostitute is more important than the right to be a prostitute. If like 30% of the prostitutes is forced into it, then the remaining 70% has bad luck but they will have to accept that the situation is unacceptable.

You rather have 90% forced in it? because that's the way it will go to when it's illigal. Another question you should ask yourself is why there are still so many that are forced?

I maintain that Tsarist Russia was a lot worse for Russians, Ukrainians, Poles, etc than early Soviet Russia. With Stalin all bets are off, but then Lenin didn't want Stalin to succeed him anyway. 

As for examples, there are some, although it is important to keep in mind that the Bolsheviks were notoriously ""good"" at keeping records of their atrocities. That's not the norm in history. One example could be the various anti-Jewish pogroms of the late Tsardom, many of which are believed to have been supported or even initiated by the state.

Right!  

Well, fans of the history of thought are aware that France has made a great number of rather brilliant philosophical (not to mention political, artistic etc.) contributions to the world. It's not just Descartes launching modern philosophy or Sartre's existentialist analyses, it's coming up with essential enlightenment ideas, many other intellectual movements and much more. But all that this apparent ""*French  philosopher*"" could muster (when asked to ""*define French civilization*"") was to borrow some of the idiotic clichés that any rather dull foreigner might use (""*women, literature and cuisine*""). WTFuckingF!?! Is this a joke?

Generally, I perceive no genuine love, insight or even basic understanding of France in Finkielkraut's writings. He doesn't particularly even seem to like France and sometimes borders on the Anti-French. One senses that he might be happier in the US (""*... impressive ...  truly multicultural society ... the strength of its patriotism ... particularly evident after the attacks of September 11, 2001 ...*"").

And needless to say that his attempt at presenting himself as *more French than the French* falls far short of being convincing:


&gt;Finkielkraut: *I defend these values [of the French Republic] because I probably owe more to my schooling than do the Français de souche, the hereditary French. French traditions and history were not laid in my cradle. Anyone who does not bring along this heritage can acquire it in l'école républicaine, the French school system. It has expanded my horizons and allowed me to immerse myself in French civilization.*

&gt;SPIEGEL: *And made you into its apologist?*

&gt;Finkielkraut: *I can speak and write more openly than others precisely because I am not a hereditary Frenchman. The natives easily allow themselves to be unnerved by the prevailing discourse. I don't have such complexes.*

""*The natives*""? Yeah, ok! What bollocks! His whole argument smells of disingenuous bullshit. Finkielkraut is also one of the founders of [**JCall**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JCall) an Israeli lobby. This is an organisation that is active  trying to influence the European parliament **from** France, but not **for** France, for Israel instead. Our ""*French philosopher*"" is an Israeli lobbyist. 

Now, that's to some extent fine.  And there is no reason to believe that he is a bad person. Finkielkraut had been through the Auschwitz concentration camp. The horrors he must have witnessed there seem to have made him into someone somewhat (understandably) obsessed with the fate of Jews and therefore the state of Israel. 

But if the main aspect of Finkielkraut's life was the trauma of having been through Auschwitz, this does not make him your typical  ""*French philosopher*"". Finkielkraut is all about Israel. All his actions and writings seem to be part of some activist effort on behalf of the Jewish state. 

Understand that I agree with most of his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but I disagree with his being so focused on that part of the planet. If you are going to be a ""*French philosopher*"", be a  French fucking philosopher and never mind lobbying to the European parliament for Israel, Palestine, Uganda, Zimbabwe or anybody else. You might then manage a little better than ""*women, literature and cuisine*"". And to think that France gave you the fucking Légion d'honneur! WTF man! 

And how did Spiegel ever consider Finkielkraut as a go-to authority on defining ""*the French identity*""? It's not that whatever he says is necessarily inaccurate (I actually agree with some of it) but his ""*clash of civilizations*"" perspective seems to have more to do with Arabs and Israel than ... ""*the French mode of European civilization*"". 

This is partly due to an ad hominem falacy, but let's be *Franc* (de souche or not), when he writes: ""*I am pained to see that the French mode of European civilization is threatened*"" I simply don't believe him. What he probably means is that he would be pained to see that Israel might be threatened. The French mode of European civilization, he doesn't seem to actually give a flying fuck about. 

Cheers!

But the Bolshevicks had to came and took back the empire to turan-tatar horde times with their totaliarian Cheka police, great terrors in 1918–1921, 1928–1931, 1934–1935, 1937–1938, 1943–1946, 1948–1953, and the deadly GULAG system which took so many lives that nobody knows where the number ends.

I get why you don't like the Soviet Union and Communism, but I think you're trying too hard to pass it off as something demonic, something evil beyond ""basic"" totalitarianism. History does not agree. Don't you think the Tsar had a secret police? Don't you think he had mass executions or purges? Of course he did! It's just that they weren't as public. This was an era of human civilization where information was more and more accessible, even in totalitarian nations, and even when so many were living in abject poverty and were unable to read and write. 

I also never blamed Stalin for ""all the bad that happened"", but as I've studied the Russian Revolution and Stalinism I feel justified in speaking with some confidence here. 

I think you're speaking from emotion here, which shows in your argument about the Gulags. No, we don't know all there is to know about them, but this is not the 1970s. These days we do have a fairly good picture of what they were like and how many people passed through them. And the fact of the matter is, the number of people killed in them is far below the numbers of some historians, like Robert Conquest, who were perhaps operating under a mix of blameless ignorance (Soviet records weren't released until around the fall of the Soviet Union, obviously), and strong bias (whether it was justified or not).

That's not to say that the Gulags weren't terrible, but they are a little less of the bogeyman than we thought during the Cold War. 

Finally, I find your tone a little bit unnecessary in your final argument. It is a *historical fact* that Lenin categorically did not want Stalin to succeed him. Stalin eventually gaining power is more a display of Stalin's incredible talent for ruthless party politics and ability to assume any position which gained him power than any indictment of the system itself.

Die Klassifikation der Produkte erfolgt für den Endverbraucher an Hand des Lebensmittelrechts, dort sind Standards definiert unter denen ein Produkt angeboten werden darf. Es steht hier die Frage im Raum, warum wählen die Verbraucher ihre Lebensmittel über den Preis und nicht über die Qualität? - Möchte ich kurz an Hand von Milch erläutern: Sämtliche gängigen Flüssigmilchprodukte (Vollmilch, fettarme Milch, Biomilch usw.) basieren auf den Qualitätsstandards von Rohmilch (§3 MilchVO); als traditionelle Alternative zur Rohmilch gilt Vorzugsmilch (gemäß §7 MilchVO), welche unter strengeren hygenischen Anforderungen produziert wird - dadurch jedoch auch etwas teurer ist. Für Vorzugsmilch besteht jedoch nur eine geringe Verbrauchernachfrage, demzufolge ist es für einen Produzenten auch nicht empfehlenswert sich auf dieses Segment zu verlegen.

Das eine Liberalisierung des Marktes zu sinkenden Preisen führt wird besonders an Hand der Europäischen Zuckermarktordnung (läuft 2017 aus) deutlich. So liegt der EU-Zuckerpreis etwa dreimal höher als der Weltmarktpreis. Durch eine Marktöffnug würden die Rohrzuckerimporte steigen und eine Konkurrenz gegenüber dem teureren Rübenzucker bilden - der Preis würde also fallen. Das Qualitätsstandards unter diesen Bedingungen per se aufgehoben werden, möchte ich zurückweisen. Es werden jedoch günstigere Produkte, zumeist mit minderer Qualität, auf den Markt gebracht - welche gekauft werden entscheidet am Ende der Verbraucher und somit auch ob zukünftig noch hochwertige Produkte in größerem Umfang produziert werden können (siehe den Fall Rohmilch vs. Vorzugsmilch).",0,1386532975,null,0,false,0,cdwsagi,t3_1sb8rq,t1_cdwsagi,t1_cdwlsmh,null,1428338236,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

1. When the people with options leave, that leaves a vacuum for the people with no other option- runaways and the trafficked. People who might not be able to get into a legit business, but who can get all too easily into a criminal enterprise.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Statues and books mean different things in the human consciousness.

 Statues are idealized symbols embedded in eternal stone, seeking emotional reactions from the viewer, playing off existing connections.

 Books contain content and knowledge, narrative or explicit, and sometimes encourage the reader to think, other times to suspend disbelief, but mostly to follow its internal logic, and thus be judged on its value and consistency. Some books become symbols, but on the foundation of their content.

Its in the nature of youth to question assumptions, meaning, symbols and custom. Its needs to be so to allow expanding beyond the self-imposed borders of the previous generation, which might turn out empty or misplaced. Sometimes they find out that those things are necessary,such as the custom of politeness, and sometimes they push through a barrier kept alive by fear and ignorance. This struggle vitalizes the culture.

Statues, icons, flags, and any other such short hand for what we take as having implied meaning and value represent these boundaries. They are the symbols of the experiences of the past. Books are the records of those experiences. While we need books to understand those symbols, the symbols only help disguise the past by their idealized nature. 

The sarcastic comparison is thus misplaced. I do not advocate destroying knowledge, but enacting a symbolic ritual by tearing down symbol itself. The statue could be of a clown, a ancient hero or a moose, the content is not that important, though it holding some value improves it. The act of getting together with others and collapsing a solid object demanding the viewers attention would be enough, allowing people to bask in the spirit of solidarity, empowerment and irreverance,knowing that, much like that statue, all symbols can be brought down, and the idealized is not the holy.",0,1386536543,null,0,false,0,cdwu1d0,t3_1sdxpx,t1_cdwu1d0,t1_cdwt021,null,1428337420,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

true,meidei,CYPR,Demilitarised Cyprus 2015 Special: isyan! devrim! özgürlük!,"&gt; a western europan country

We really aren't that. Greece was westernised, but we weren't. 

&gt; Are they behind this? Or is this more the spirit of the people?

It's hard to tell sometimes. For example, in some parliamentary committees there are law proposals stuck for decades (for example, legalisation of cremation, and legalisation and regulation of in-vitro fertilisation). Those laws are stuck in committees for so long because Orthodox bishops come in every session and preach the Church's official position. But the MPs invite them over. They don't have to, but they do because that's how they feel it should be. 

Now, about the education, because of the crappy constitution Britain gave us, the Church might even be on the right side of the debate when they claim that ""all Greek-speaking *public* schools in Cyprus should provide Orthodox Christian education of confessional nature"". Which is what is happening. Because of the political situation with Turkey and Northern Cyprus, our constitution cannot be amended before the dispute is settled one way or another. 

But that's the legal side. In practice, the Minister of Education could theoretically go against the while of the Church, but that requires immense political capital because the 3/4 of the population of southern Cyprus are attached to their Christian-Greek cultural identity, even though probably half of them would say they are agnostic if you pressure them a bit. 

The current MinEdu, and the current government in general are extremely conservative. The MinEdu visited the Holy Synod (the Church's High Council's meeting) as his first task when he was appointed, and kept going for every installment. There, he receives the Church's views, which up until now, he implements without objecting. Now for example, primary schools have to cut time out of classes and organise students to help at churches during mass (something that in my time was Bible Study Group's job), and form religious choirs ready to perform on holy days. All that in public schools, during school time. 

&gt; Is there something like a sex health education movement in Cyprus?

There is, yes. It was part of the general Educational Reform movement, which rightfully aimed for a complete overhaul of the system. For a moment it even looked like it was going to happen, under the previous, Labour (so slightly progressive), government. 

Educational material was written from scratch, new teaching methods were introduced to active teachers, but the Archbishop dismissed it by saying ""I don't even need to read the new curriculum, the leftists are writing it so it's all about attacking our religion"". After that it was extremely difficult to implement it. Finally, the current government quickly killed it and nothing was implemented at the end. 

Changes included some bits of sex education even at primary school level (which made parents of the beta testing classrooms furious), a bit less confessional religious class (but still not a secular lesson on religion and ethics, but at least your teachers wouldn't be allowed to tell you that you will burn in hell), and also reforms on language teaching (which, as a to-be linguist, I can't emphasise enough how important they were. The current system results to Native Language average scores being consistently below the threshold: this year it was 40/100 for highschool graduates, while the same score for English as Second Language is 70/100. The new method, based of Halliday's grammar framework, was deemed ""neomarxist"", ""anti-Greek"", ""convince us we actually speak Turkish and we don't know it"" and ""aiming to make the local dialect the country's official language(!!!)"").

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"&gt;What would you say to the current way of monarchies in Europe? 

Interesting - you don't hear this brought up very often in the context of federalization. I find that the greatest use of the monarchy (at least in the case of Belgium) is their diplomatic value.  The way I understand it is that in Africa and south-east Asia they act as regular ambassadors to areas where monarchies still project an air of grandeur.  This helps lubricate trade agreements, investments, development projects and cultural exchanges.

Certainly they would have to be kept, no state would allow their own monarchy to be stripped away by an external force (however irreverent their subjects may be). Keeping the royals as pimped diplomats could be justification enough to retain them - as for the details regarding actual power and decision making ability I will not speculate for lack of knowledge.

Le système des grandes écoles, basé sur des examens sélectifs, est le système *normal* dans quasiment tous les pays comparables au notre. Il force les étudiants à travailler dur, depuis le lycée, ce qui les amène au plus haut niveau par la suite.

C'est l'université à la française qui est une anomalie. Elle laisse entrer des milliers d'étudiants médiocres, qui font baisser le niveau global et dont les années en échec coutent une fortune à la collectivité.

Une noblesse? Bien au contraire! L'examen d'entrée est le critère le plus égalitaire qui soit, il suffit de travailler dur au lycée et de présenter son dossier. Le prix n'est pas un frein, regardez toutes ces prépas publiques et ces grandes écoles que les élèves financent par l'apprentissage.

Pas de remise en cause? Pour les avoir côtoyé je suis convaincu que les professeurs de prépa sont habitués à le faire. Il n'y a pas d'excellence sans remise en cause, et ces professeurs sont vraiment excellents. Les accuser du contraire n'est qu'un procès d'intention, encore une manie française.

Une rente sociale? Non, un investissement. C'est à l'université de s'améliorer pour amener ses étudiants à être plus compétitif, pour qu'ils puissent enfin tailler des croupières aux élèves sortis des grandes écoles.

Pas de prise de risque? Je serais plus nuancé sur ce point. Les français n'aiment pas le risque, quelle que soit leur provenance scolaire. L'argent est sale, disent certains...

true,ichbinsisyphos,ASTR,Austria,"&gt; Even if Europe will allow membership it is just a mater of time before Ukraine's economy crumbles and becomes another dead-weight. 

I don't think so. The least developed economies in the EU have always been relatively stable during the crisis, because the growth potential remains high no matter what. It's the more average economies that struggle because they already have to do more to keep growing and they are not yet strong enough to do so.

If the Ukraine meets the EU's terms, I am willing to assume that corruption and other counterproductive behaviors are solved. That there is a huge economical potential for both the Ukraine and the EU there should be completely obvious, even more than for Poland back then, the Ukraine is unnecessarily poor in my opinion.

However I am more and more in favor of a slower expansion of the EU. A lot of the more recent additions seem to be primarily interested in EU funds, it is necessary that there is some evidence that they support the European idea, at least later on.

No country changed their corruption rating overnight and none of them reduced it significantly. I don't see how Ukraine will manage to do that being one of the worst countries in corruption worldwide. 

Now, speaking about Poland, don't be fooled by the current growth. Every country which is now in regression showed significant growth after adopting the euro currency. The ordeal for Poland, Bulgaria etc. is far from over and it remains to be seen what the outcome will be. 

I am also a supporter of a slower EU integration. The European idea cannot be adopted overnight (or in some cases ever) and its adoption by Ukraine will be the hardest EU ever faced. There aren't many examples where a country fully adopted European ideals. Everyone is misguided by the idea that integration means infinite resources till the end of time. The current crisis proved it. I believe that the EU should now stick to healing its current economy before trying to expand. Such a stretch may cause irreversible damage.

Quand Twitter fait une IPO à 24,7 milliards de dollars, c'est bon pour l'actionnaire, c'est bon pour le PIB US mais ça n'a aucun impact sur le niveau de vie des américains ou le partage de la valeur. Et Twitter est une boite qui n'a jamais dégagé de bénéfices. Et ne parlons pas de la contribution fiscale d'entreprises comme Google, Apple ou Amazon qui peuvent afficher des exercices déficitaires localement et se domicilient dans des tax heavens. C'est assez documenté pour ne pas être contestable.

* you can smoke, fuck, drop anything if you're over 24( or from 16 with the approval of both parents, but they assume responsibility for the consequences) some rights can be restricted by local judges

* the EU's only role is to represent it's citizens interests in cases where companies may mislead the consumer, bad LSD, cars that broke down after 2 weeks of regular use, ENERGY CARTELS !! ); Any company that knowingly mislead the public is convicted for corruption, anti-trust cases or endangered the public is banned from the EU for 10 years, no fines, no settlements, if you tried to ""cheat the market"" you're out

* administration would generally fall on cities and municipalities, national governments would be symbolic, infrastructure, large energy exchanges, environmental restrictions, business licences and all large scale projects would be made as a collaboration between different municipalities; healthcare services, education, law enforcement and rehabilitation will be done by private contractors  and financed by the municipality. 

* there will be 3 types of prisons, rehabilitation centers (contextual crimes), regular ( repeated offenders, minimum of 5 years) and mental asylums (psychopaths), the purpose is correction and confinement and in no case punishment;

* voting is mandatory for everyone over 24 years, parties will have to fight for local electoral colleges trough the duration of a political cycle, and if they don't have at least the support of 20 million people before the parliamentary elections they don't get to run. After the parliament is put in office, parties make alliances and put forth 2 candidates and their cabinets, one of them will become the prime minister, after another round of elections. 

* All ballots will have the option: none of the above, if this option is selected by more than 50% of voters the candidates are disqualified and the parties have to select other candidates and/or new alliances(if this situation appears at a local level, open elections will be held, where anyone can register as a candidate)

* in parallel there will be elections(local and continental) for constitutional judges with a mandate of 10(15) years, they can block any political process but can not repeal, any decision, they can submit the law either to parliament or to a referendum.

TL;DR strict but limited continental government, a lot of freedom for local governments, companies and individuals

true,TheActualAWdeV,FRIE,Fryslân/Bilkert,"&gt;Abolishing legal prostitution does seem to reduce trafficking. In Sweden, prostitution has plummeted since a 1999 ban on buying sex. In 2007, Der Spiegel reported a maximum of 130 prostitutes working in Stockholm, compared to 5,000 in its smaller Norwegian neighbor Oslo (which in 2009, followed Sweden’s ban with its own). And while an estimated 600 women are believed to be trafficked into Sweden every year, this number pails in comparison to the 15,000 trafficked annually to Finland, a country with a population half the size.

Because the only comment you can make with regard to human trafficking is that they all end up as whores, right. And that therefore a lenient policy regarding prostitution is to blame, right.

Those numbers mean jack fucking diddly squat. For all we know all those people are trafficked into finland to fight gladiatorial battles to the death against moose and polar bears.

Ou plutôt sur la compréhension de ce qui avait été écrit. 90% du post est démonté explicitement dans mon premier post. Peut-être n'est-ce pas assez spécifique voire trop ""meta"". Donc je retente. 

Le système des grandes écoles n'est pas le système normal dans le monde. Certains pays choisissent peut-être d'établir des examens d'entrée à l'université mais les élèves ne sont pas ensuite dirigés vers des écoles minuscules aux effectifs confidentiels. Donc source ?

Quant à l'échec de l'université imputé à un manque de sélection, c'est oublier bien vite que la faute en est à un bac dont les filières ont été multipliées et les exigences rabaissées d'annés en années. Mais quel rapport avec le problème des prépas ? A part peut-être qu'on a décidé que sacrifier l'université n'était qu'un moindre mal puisque notre système ( les prépas ) ne serait pas impacté.

Oui, une noblesse. C'est une évidence. Merci de ne pas vendre le mythe d'une prépa méritocratique alors qu'elle est en quelque sorte le point culminant d'un système parmi les plus inégalitaires au monde comme le disent les rapports PISA. Les chiffres de la reproduction sociale aux ENS et à l'X sont tellement honteux qu'ils sont tenus secrets. Une noblesse se caractérise par une hérédité et des prébendes. Pour l'hérédité, c'est dit. Pour les prébendes, le classement des Mines censé concurrencer celui de Shanghai ne montre qu'une chose : que les entreprises françaises de haute volée sont des chasses gardées. 

Je remets en cause les profs de prépa ? Non pas. Mais au contraire les élites issues d'un système dont les profs de prépa ne sont que les chevilles ouvrières. Chez ces élites, on oscille clairement entre un biais comparatif ( l'université c'est de la merde, donc les prépas sont bien alors que ce sont qui décident de sacrifier l'université à la masse en préservant les prépas ), une crainte d'une remise en cause de leur propre légitimité ( Ils sont les meilleurs d'une sous-partie de la population. En fait, ils ne font la course qu'entre eux, comme les rugbymen sud-africains blancs sous l'apartheid ) et un intérêt objectif à garder un système qui les favorise ( Pour eux-mêmes puisqu'ils ont besoin de nouvelles recrues pour consolider leur réseau, et pour leurs enfants qui y entreront le plus facilement ). 

Oui, une rente sociale. Un investissement implique une valeur objective. Une rente repose sur une imperfection du système et son inertie à refléter la valeur réelle. Economy 101. 

Ce n'est pas une question de risque. C'est une question des valeurs qu'on inculque par la classe prépa et d'un moule qu'on arrive à considérer comme une qualité alors qu'il se révèle désastreux d'un point de vue individuel et catastrophique d'un point de vue sociétal. Je ne dénonce pas l'aversion au risque. Je dénonce des atavismes méritocratiques qui en viennent à vanter le formatage. Est-ce qu'on est meilleur parce qu'on a dit oui à tout ?

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"I studied Israel and briefly lived there, so I will offer my impressions of that country. Whether or not the country is ""European"" depends on what characteristics you consider to be ""European,"" so I will try to be as broad as possible.

The differences:

* Religion: Obviously, the biggest cultural difference between Israel and Europe is that the majority of Israel's population is Jewish, not Christian. Europe has for most of the past couple millennia been linked deeply with Christianity, and Israel is not a part of that tradition. What's more, Israelis do not share the antipathy to institutional religion that is maintained to various degrees by western Europeans. Most Israelis are not deeply religious, but Jewish traditions are maintained by a huge majority of the Jewish population. Holidays like Yom Kippur and Passover are taken much more seriously by the average Israeli than are Christian holidays by the average Spaniard, Briton, or German. 

* The military: The next obvious difference between Israel and (again, mostly western) Europeans is the profoundly different lessons that they took from the horrors of WWI and WWII. Europeans saw millions die because of state-to-state combat and decided that the clashes between nation-states held too high a cost to ever be repeated, so military conflicts need to be prevented at virtually any cost. The Israelis, on the other hand, saw millions die and could do nothing about it because they had no army to save themselves--or at least fight to a valiant end. Their lesson was that the Jewish people must never be left defenseless again, and therefore they've armed themselves and act to defend themselves. While Israelis don't *like* war and want to spare their children the horror of war, they certainly recognize the necessity of military might in a way that most Europeans perceive as ""stuck in the past.""

The similarities:

* Socialism: Like France, Italy, Spain, and the Nordics, Israel has a strong socialist party in its national politics. The Labor Party in Israel held power for almost 30 years after independence, and was extremely strong until the Labor Party made the first major agreements with the Palestinians, and subsequent violence against Israelis by Palestinians tainted the image of Labor in Israel.

* The West: Israel sees itself as an integral part of the West. Much like Europe, American cultural influences are everywhere: American music plays in clubs, American shows air on TV, etc.. Like Europeans, Israelis have a sort of love-hate relationship with the idea of the West:  they like to assert their own sovereignty and the uniqueness of their culture, but they begrudgingly acknowledge that they share interests with Americans and Europeans on a broad range of issues. The Israeli right in particular is fond of telling people that Israel is (to paraphrase) a bastion of civilization in a barbarous region. The ""civilization"" that they are referring to is the West.

* Liberal democracy: Ignoring the non-citizen, enemy Palestinians for a moment, Israel is a deeply democratic country. In its 64 years of history, it has never had a coup, and power has been passed peacefully from one government to another since independence. Israelis are justly proud of their courts, which are internationally acknowledged as being of particularly high quality (the Canadian supreme court, IIRC, referenced a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court in one of its own decisions). While there is discrimination against the Arab minority--which makes up almost 20% of the Israeli population--Israeli Arabs are afforded the same rights as Jewish Israelis, and the Jewish population has a remarkable amount of patience with Israeli-Arab politicians, who flirt scandalously with enemy groups like Hezbollah or Hamas.

The Swedish Sex Purchase Act: Claimed Success and 
Documented Effects1
 
By Susanne Dodillet and Petra Östergren 
Conference paper presented at the International Workshop: 


Decriminalizing Prostitution and 
Beyond: Practical Experiences and Challenges. The Hague, March 3 and 4, 2011 
...
We believe that one has to look at several factors to understand the discrepancy between the 
stated success of the Sex Purchase Act and its documented effects. While there are some 
police, social workers and former sex workers who claim that the ban has indeed helped  25
reduce prostitution and trafficking and deterred clients without any adverse effects, the reports 
and documents that have a scientific rather than ideological base do not support these success 
claims. Hence, as we and others have written elsewhere, we believe that it is in the ideological 
and cultural domains that the creation of the “unique” Sex Purchase Act and the above 
mention discrepancy must be found. It has to do with a desire to create and uphold a national 
identity of being the moral consciousness in the world; with notions or “good” and “bad” 
sexuality; with the whore stigma; with creating new forms of sexual deviancy; with a 
communitarian, rather than liberal, political culture, and perhaps above all: a stereotypical and 
uninformed understanding of prostitution.102
 
Our stance when it comes to policy regarding prostitution is that it has to be based on 
knowledge rather than morality or radical feminist ideology. We also believe that when policy 
is developed, the actors at the heart of this policy must be adequately consulted and duly 
respected. In our opinion, this has not been the case with regards to “the Swedish model”.

&gt;Fact is, they aren't even as half as the population who thinks that Ukraine should side with Russia.

What are you basing this on? Opinion polls done before the about-face on the the EU association agreement don't agree with you.

&gt; Traditionally Eastern Ukraine (AKA the industrial part) is actually more favorable to Russia. Everyone speaks Russian there, even in villages. 

Primary language does not correlate very well with political views in Ukraine. People in Kiev are largely Russian-speaking, yet they overwhelmingly support integration with the EU and hate Yanukovych. On the other hand, people in eastern Ukrainian villages speak Ukrainian (you've claimed the opposite, and as someone who visited and lived in several such villages, I can tell you that you're wrong on that point), and yet often support Yanukovych. Speaking Russian does not imply some kind of ""allegiance"" to Russia, far from it.

&gt;more people there speak Ukrainian (not clear Ukrainian I might add, it's a mix of Ukrainian, Russian and Polish languages).

Again, you know not of what you speak. The mix (which does not include Polish) is called [Surzhyk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surzhyk) and is not widely spoken in the West or in Kiev, but in central and eastern Ukraine.

&gt;By EU membership standards, Ukraine will never have a chance to become a member.

Never, eh? You sure you want to be so brave as to just go ahead and predict that? I mean, if we looked at the world in 1960, even just economically, and said ""this is how it's going to remain"", would that not be laughable to us today?

The problem is there's really nobody who can lead Ukraine towards being a western-like country. This is a problem that existed in all countries from the Eastern Block but it's truly gargantuan in Ukraine because the country is huge. Its leading powers are probably the most corrupt in the whole Eastern Block. I'm talking about corruption at a state level, something that's unfathomable to people from western Europe. Breaking down this corruption and aligning the country with western nations seems like an impossible tasks because people currently living in Ukraine would have to accept living through very hard times for the next 20 - 40 years in order to reach that dream. I think this kind of proposal is very very very hard to even talk about, let alone try to implement. How do you prevent disillusions 10 years down the road from throwing the country right back at Russia's tit? How do you ensure progress against Russia's background machinations and foreground image-play of ""waiting mother"" guilt-tripping common people every time they take a glance at her?

Make absolutely no mistake. Ukraine is a MAJOR problem that you can't just throw money at and hope it will solve itself. Trying to help Ukraine is not something that is risk-free. Europe will feel a major recoil if the attempt fails.

Second, for the group size you are targeting, hotels, wholesalers and travel agencies will laugh at you. Eventual discounts are negotiated on the fly when booking the individual arrangements, worry more about good locations so your customers are happy. Penny-pinching here makes for a bland, unattractive tour in the end. Travel agencies won't help much either. You want individuality, not mass production.

You need a local contact, native German, to propose things to you, arrange bookings etc. The proposed tour stops from the local perspective would then need to be edited and altered by you to cater to your audience.

Get a group together, agree on a percentage with your local guy and pay him for the first tour to get things rolling. From the profits of the first tour, you can move on to the second. Sounds feasible to me, I know guys who do this in Germany for Japan tours, for example.

Fair warning: I would expect no less than 50% as the local contact. The legwork here is the major part of the work (and the least fun).

For sushi, I don't know one within walking distance that I can vouch for. The place I used to go to has moved and is now a franchise. If you are willing to go there is however an area in Paris where many Japanese restaurants are located (I usually go there for ramen so I can't recommend any sushi place) : rue Sainte Anne.
My pick for sushi is Japikeo but it's not within walking distance :

&gt; Ostile al sindacato c'è Renzi. Vatti a fare un ripasso delle cose che dice al riguardo. Peraltro non devi andare troppo indietro. Ha appena fatto un discorso in cui ci ha tenuto a fare ancora la faccia cattiva contro i sindacati. Bene così.

per quanto riguarda i sindacati renzi parla di ""cura dimagrante"", quindi non si tratta di una totale opposizione, semplicemente la volontà di una riforma in linea con quelle d'organizzazione politica. non mi pare un'idea criminale. cito un virgolettato:

&gt; Io non sono in contrasto con i sindacati, in alcuni momenti i sindacati funzionano molto bene e fanno un servizio al Paese e in altri i sindacati sono un problema. Siccome io dico che bisogna dimezzare il numero di persone che fanno politica, allo stesso modo anche i sindacati, se vogliono essere davvero rappresentativi, devono fare una bella cura dimagrante: non e' possibile che ci sia tutto questo numero di persone che usufruisce dei permessi sindacali. ci sono alcuni sindacati che svolgono molto bene il loro lavoro, anche che hanno idee profondamente diverse dalle mie''

&gt; Sì, il modello imprenditori vs operari c'è, è la destra che spinge per superarlo e mettere su le guerre tra poveri.

non capisco questo discorso. ti da fastidio che un uomo di sinistra pensi agli imprenditori? rappresenta il centro sinistra, eh, non un soviet russo. nel mondo contemporaneo non esiste centro sinistra in cui il leader non si preoccupi degli interessi dell'imprenditoria (es. obama), e giustamente. si tratta solo di un modello d'ispirazione diverso rispetto a quello di un centro destra dove gli interessi del lavoratore sono dimenticati. a me pare che renzi ponga l'aspetto MOLTO spesso sui diritti del lavoro (ad es. sulla modifica delle leggi per renderle più snelle, idea sacrosanta), che poi non sia un comunista mi sembra davanti agli occhi di tutti.

&gt; Politicamente è il nulla, è solo un mediocre uomo di marketing, che per la sua inspienza peraltro ha una città di cui sarebbe il sindaco che è pronta a cacciarlo a calci in culo.

curioso che tu dica questo, considerando che in toscana ieri ha avuto quasi **l'OTTANTA** percento di preferenze, tra le più alte in italia. i pareri di chi è di firenze sono contrastanti - ho sentito persone intelligenti e di diversi colori politici pensare sia un po' manchevole su diverse cose, o pensare sia un grandissimo sindaco. sulla parte del ""mediocre"" uomo di marketing non so cosa dire. quasi il 70%, ragazzi. se un mediocre uomo di marketing prende il 70% pensa uno bravino...

aggiungo di aver votato civati (non è un alibi, eh :) ) e che condivido il timore di renzi come uomo troppo impegnato a non scontentare entrambe le parti. d'altra parte non penso nemmeno sia il male assoluto, e ho speranza che possa essere l'inizio di un futuro diverso. si vedrà.

&gt;The move is the latest in a series of shifts in Russia’s news landscape, which appear to point toward a tightening of state control in the already heavily regulated media sector.

&gt; ... Head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov said the changes were about saving money and making state media more effective.

RIA Novosti was set up in 1941, two days after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Information Bureau, and now has reporters in over 45 countries providing news in 14 languages.

Other than that, many Germans might find it somewhat annoying that the first thing people everywhere in the world think when they hear ""Germany"" is ""Oktoberfest"".
