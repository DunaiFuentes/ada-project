Keep that stoicism when you'll be unlucky.

So you feel that somehow natives have more  rights...just because...What about second and third generation immigrants? Or mixed race children, an immigrant has a baby with a local. Where is the line?

We don't matter when it comes to history, legacy, or war, we do matter for our family our friends, this is why risking our life her a hero fantasy is not heroic is selfish and delusional.

&gt;it's nice to fight for a politician's ideals. I mean real causes which you believe in.

if only this was the case, but we are prgramed to follow leaders and adapt our ideal to theirs.

Because all people follow their self interest, if you give them a job, take care of their children and give them the change to earn a decent living and don't squash their identity and self respect, they would be crazy to give it up, just to live in squalor and risk their life for ""religious ideals"". Some will, but I guarantee that he will be beaten and reported to the authorities by members of his own community.

Because each city handled hate gypsies issue differently, some moved the community out of the city, others tried out reach programs, in most cases it was solved just by preventing illegal activities if they realise the risk of tricking the system is great they won't be tempted, and giving them the possibility to earn a decent wage.People don't break the law because they're sociopaths, in most cases, they break it because they see their neighbours doing it, gettin away with it and getting more value from it than he is from his regular low level job.

Well maybe some cops where racist and that termed cached on for the media.

Münster and the closeby Osnabrück are where the Peace of Westphalia was signed - this ended the Thirty Years' War *and* the Eighty Years'War. Can you imagine a war going on for that long, let alone two? [See Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia). Edit: There are not many remnants left over from this, I believe there's a small statue close to the ULB's front, the rest was destroyed, stolen or got lost in all these subsequent wars.

Münster also still has the cages in which the bodies of the Münster Rebellion's leaders where shown, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnster_Rebellion). Basically, some anabaptists thought there should be an anabaptist kingdom, so they took over Münster and made one. That pissed off quite a few people who came marching into the city, executed their leaders and displayed their bodies in cages for the world to see as a warning to not try that shit again. The cages are still hanging at the St. Lamberti church, though I doubt they're the ""originals"".

Then there's Cologne, which has the Dom, one of the biggest cathedrals in Europe. Because they halted construction since they ran out of money in 1473, it was left unfinished until *1880*. I can't think of any current structure that's just left unfinished for 400 years (maybe the new airport in Berlin hurrdurrr)

Then there's Düsseldorf which is full of uptight rich people, and is the center of Japanese life in Germany for some reason.

Edit:

&gt;Are there some interesting or funny cultural quirks about nordrhein westfalen?

Yes! Nordrhein-Westfalen has lots of weird, almost-dead languages. Münster has Masematte, a language based on Rotwelsch, and Masematte has mostly died out. It used to be the language of the outsiders - it contains yiddish, some Romani and some words from the students' language. Only few speak it anymore, though some of the words survived in Münster's dialect, and I know that there's a few bars in which all the old speakers hang around.

I think what is very interesting in our history is the Coal. There is a big part of NRW which is called Ruhrgebiet. In the Ruhrgebiet very much coal was mined. Now most of the pits are shut down but you can visit some. The Zeche Zollverein here in Essen is one of the most popular pits and an UNESCO World Heritage. You can visit it and take part in some guided tours. Besides this there are many mining related museums like the Ruhrmuseum. 

The people in the Ruhrgebiet, also called Pott or Ruhrpott, also got an accent, which sounds even harder than the normal german language does and was mainly used by the industrial workers back then. I'm 17 and in my generation this accent is getting weaker and weaker, because you can't talk to people like teachers or you boss with the accent. My parents don't want to hear this accent from me, too. Some typical things we do while speaking is turning ""das"" into ""datt"" and ""was"" into ""watt"".  Further there are some words that are just different and we do grammatical mistakes but nobody cares. :D


What I told you wasn't very NRW related but this is what got in my mind when i read your questions and I hope you can use this anyway. I would suggest to give the Ruhrgebiet it's own part in your project.

Well, yes. Israel signed peace treaties with Jordan and Egypt, but that was only after they gave up claims to Gaza/the West Bank. The PLO that claims sovereignty over these areas has not negotiated a peace treaty with Israel as of now, so it's still at war.

&gt; The US have their head up Israel's ass, they can defend them. 

US contributions to Israel are not for Israel's sake and not that big either (maybe 3% of Israel's budget). Israel is a hight-tech nation and to prevent them from exporting sensitive equipment to China &amp; co., the US offers them hardware at a discount. So the American subsidies are actually just subsidies for US arms manufacturers.

Israel is constantly under attack. It has the right to defend itself. It doesn't have to wait till it's wiped off the map to retaliate with nuclear force. You'll find that Israel has not fired a single shot at countries that have made peace with them.

Art 2 specifies the state has exclusive competence on its authorisation, which must be initiated by the president (quirk of Spanish legal system, PM), approved by the cabinet, unless the Constitution gives Congress the attribution, and called by the king in the form of a Royal Decree.
There's a final disposition that exemptions out consultations by the local administration within their areas of competence, but reserving to the state their authorisation, which in any event wouldn't fit here.

true,elphieLil84,sardegna,,"In Sardinia, where I come from, there is no ""malocchio"" called as such, but we have a ceremony called ""medicina dell'occhio"" (""medicine of the eye""), to literally free you from malocchio.

In our interpretation, malocchio is caused by somebody who, envying you for something, starts to be negative or feel negatively towards you, conjuring negativity on you, even without knowing it.

To free you from this negativity, you need the ""medicina dell'occhio"". People mostly go to people they know to request it when they feel like too many negative events are happening in their lives, and they feel like somebody in particular might have negative feelings towards them. They generally go and ask the medicina to somebody in their family, to try to be sure that it is a person they can trust and has no negative feelings towards them too.

As far as I know, they take a basin, fill it with water, and then put some drops of olive oil in it. If they float, there is no malocchio. If they ""tend to sink"", you have it. In that case, the ceremony resolves is some formulas and prayers in Sardinian, and the water is thrown away at dawn to chase the negativity away.

I know this because one of my friends, an engineer (sigh!), asked for it from an ex girlfriend of hers, who could do it, and did it for her. Among the people I know who come from poorer, more religious or just more ignorant families, even the youngest tend to mildly believe in this. Let's say they claim they don't, but then they go for it when they are in a weaker emotional state, ""just to be sure"".

I hate the practice so much I always slag them when I hear about it. They laugh as well...but they don't deny it. The very bad part is that the ceremony and the belief tends to identify somebody as ""carrier of bad luck"", and then the rumor spreads...and it can ruin some peoples' lives. We had a singer in Italy, Mia Martini, who, among other reasons, suicided for the isolation brought around her following this reasoning.

Yes, I am sure they are just Muslims out to destroy the good reputation of the peaceful, always humnitarian Israelis.

&gt;Well, yes. Israel signed peace treaties with Jordan and Egypt, but that was only after they gave up claims to Gaza/the West Bank. The PLO that claims sovereignty over these areas has not negotiated a peace treaty with Israel as of now, so it's still at war.

Hmm- Palestinians want their own state, that is what sovereignity mean. How is that wrong?

&gt;US contributions to Israel are not for Israel's sake and not that big either (maybe 3% of Israel's budget). Israel is a hight-tech nation and to prevent them from exporting sensitive equipment to China &amp; co., the US offers them hardware at a discount. So the American subsidies are actually just subsidies for US arms manufacturers.



Bull, they are also *always* throwing their weright behind Israel as soon as there is any negotiations in the Middle East. That means more than any billiojns.

There are some surreal elements.  For example, there might be a painting on the wall in a room with objects from the painting located in the room.

The place had a strong emotional effect on me that I wasn't expecting.  I highly recommend it.

Also, one interesting and free thing to see in London is Postman's Park, which is a memorial to the heroic deeds of ordinary people.  [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postman%27s_Park)

The Royal Gardens at Kew are quite nice.  Bring a hat if it's sunny or you'll fry.

The Hayward Art Gallery on the south bank often has very interesting art.  Its exhibits seem to be temporary; there are no permanent ones, so check what's there beforehand.  [Here](http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/venues/hayward-gallery) is its website.

St. Albans (a town in England) has the oldest pub in the UK.  It's located close to the famous abbey.

Greenwich has a lot to see in a small area, like the Naval Museum and a preserved Victorian-era tea ship (the Cutty Sark, I think).  They charge you more than 20 quid to see it, though.  Don't bother trying to see the meridian line that divides the hemispheres; there are so many tourists there that it takes forever, and you have to climb a small mountain to reach it.  It isn't that impressive when you get to it.

The main thing I remember about Scotland is hiking in the heath.  It's great, but don't do it when it's very cold.  People have died.

The north of England is friendly.  When I was there, I looked at castles, Roman ruins, and Celtic standing stones.  The UK has a national heritage program that requires property owners to preserve ancient megaliths (standing stones erected by pre-Roman peoples) and brochures that tell you where to find them.  So, if you are interested, you can hike into farmer's fields to look at ancient monuments, if that's your thing.

Wales has nice castles and unpronouncable place names, but otherwise is very much like northern England.  The country roads only have one lane but traffic goes in both directions as quickly as possible.  Bring a change of underwear.

Don't bother going to the beach.  British beaches are places to be endured rather than enjoyed.  The seagulls are the size of eagles and will attack you for food.

Any state can do whatever they want on any territory that are not part of their ""home territory"" even if they are responsible for it. Deaths, discrimination etc doesn't count then. They are not really dead or discriminated, it is just a joke. Aer you fucking serious? Idiot!

Ah yes, insulting me. I chuckled. Israel isn't perfect, but there is no organised mass murder or torture. But yeah, war is not clean.

&gt; Yes, I am sure they are just Muslims out to destroy the good reputation of the peaceful, always humnitarian Israelis.

&gt; Could you have your head more up Israel's ass? 

You aren't helping your case. But yes, Muslim leaders are after Israel's reputation. It's a core tenet or propaganda to destroy the enemy's reputation. In the meanwhile, [Israel is treating victims of the Syrian civil war](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24998618) – just like they [also treat Palestinians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Israel#Palestinian_medical_tourism).

&gt; Hmm- Palestinians want their own state, that is what sovereignity mean. How is that wrong?

It's not wrong. It's just that Israel will not give up the occupation unless a peace treaty is signed. All this could have been prevented a long time ago: The Arab world didn't create a Palestinian state in the time between '48 and '67 when they were in control of Gaza and the West Bank. Blaming Israel, who is under attack by forces from that area, is not exactly just under these circumstances.

&gt; Bull, they are also always throwing their weright behind Israel as soon as there is any negotiations in the Middle East. That means more than any billiojns. 

Oh, you mean that. Well, I think [this UN interpreter really says it all](http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&amp;b=1317489&amp;ct=13398889). As long as the UN is abused to agitate against Israel, it's just fair that someone stands up for it, too.

&gt; So the bombing of Iran, Syria and Lebanon, like the phospohor bombing of a UN school was defending itself. That was a bloody war crime.

Syria is at war with Israel. Like, proper war, two states with functioning (more or less in the case of Syria) governments. Lebanon is partially under control of a terrorist group that regularly attacks Israel. Of course Israel will fight back, it's their right. I don't know what you are rambling about with Iran, Israel didn't bomb them.

As for your final remark: White phosophorus **smoke** shells, for whose use the authorising commanders were disciplined. Can't remember when a Palestinian combatant was disciplined the last time for targeting Israeli civilians. Can you? That said, Palestinian terrorists hide in densely populated areas to provoke civilian casualties. The blame mostly, if not entirely, belongs to them.

After that it got a little [chaotic](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Central_Europe_5th_Century.jpg) for a while(not for the last time).

Then there was some seriously crazy stuff involving feudal lords, Lothringians, Prussians and the French (like Napoleon).

After the middle ages, and with the industrialization, NRW became even more of an industrial powerhouse than it was before due to coal deposits, being relatively densely populated, and the coal dependent industries like the metalworking industries developing there.

The EU is nowhere near a common military for very good reasons. Look at the separate troop commitments of the French and British for example. Can we send Romanian, Bulgarian, Portuguese and Spanish troops to fight our wars in CAR, Mali and the Falklands?

What about internal conflicts? Can Britain use these hypothetical EU forces to ensure Gibraltar doesn't escalate? An EU army is incompatible with situations like this, so nation-state ones must remain. All the above locations are relevant to two EU nations and are therefore relevant to an EU army should it exist.

&gt;You can't find yourself talking about geopolitics on a global scale and still think in terms on national European states. We're only relevant as a whole.

Britain and France are still relevant on the global stage. We are still nuclear powers, still P5 nations. Still amongst the best armed forces in the world. That other nations are declining is because they weren't as important to begin with and because they have made sometimes drastic cuts because they perceive their own nation-state's threat to be minimal (and because they've covered themselves through NATO).

&gt;I'm sure that with the proper training Romanians and Bulgarians can do just as well as their western counterparts.

The reason the UN uses developing nation armies is because they are cheaper. They are cheaper because their training is cheaper, their equipment is cheaper and their salary is less. Training everyone to a French standard means we might as well use the French army. At which point the benefit of using cheaper soldiers no longer exists.

The evil eye is not a controllable form of magic power (although it is believed that some people are more likely to cast evil eye), rather it springs from envious looks, and can bring every sort of disaster. It is believed that young maidens and children are the most affected by the evil eye. In general, there are some simple rituals in order to protect oneself from the evil eye: 

* Touching iron

* Scratching balls

* [Horn gesture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_of_the_horns) (we usually point them to the ground, rather than in the air. It works like a lightning rod)

There are also other rituals, which can be practiced by women only, and they are passed down generation to generation. They can only be taught at Christmas'eve and are more complicated; they usually vary according to geographical areas.

For example, my grandmother [from the province of Caserta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Caserta) used to mutter special prayers to God in front of a plate full of water, in which oil is poured: number and form of the oil spots would reveal information about the ""jettatore"" (who cast the evil eye).

As of 2009, Tismăneanu is also Chairman of the Academic Board, Institute of People's Studies—an institution affiliated with the Democratic Liberal Party, which in turn is the main political group supportive of Băsescu's policies. The institution is presided upon by political scientist Andrei Țăranu. The following year, Tismăneanu was chosen by Democratic Liberal Premier Emil Boc to lead, with Ioan Stanomir, the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes in Romania, substituting the National Liberal Party's choice Marius Oprea.

So you're arguing that if Europe spends more on its military, it doesn't need to be as complacent with American aims? I agree 100% with you, but it comes back to the criticism the USA repeatedly made. Europe needs to spend more on its defence. 

Previously this was counterbalanced by a strong US presence in Europe. Now the USA is switching to Asia, Europe appears weaker than it once was.

Io sono sicuro che anche ""un cane"" sappia riconoscere la differenza tra un discorso potente trattato con una forma ""leggera"" (un esempio tanto per rimanere nel ""pop"": la vita è bella), e una faciloneria come questa.

Oppure il discorso è più ampio e più spaventoso, e cioè che da almeno trent'anni in Italia non esiste più una sensibilità cinematografica condivisa. O meglio, esiste, ma una grossa fetta di pubblico non riesce più a DEFINIRLA: non sa ridere se non gli dicono di ridere, non riesce a indignarsi se non gli dicono di indignarsi ecc. Questa cosa mi fa così paura su così tanti livelli (non solo riguardo alla ""morte del cinema"" che alla fine chi se ne frega) che adesso vado a sdraiarmi sul pavimento in posizione fetale per il solo fatto di aver sfiorato il pensiero.

Frankly I don't see it as our responsibility to have any interest in the Middle East or Africa unless they pose a direct threat through terrorism. I can see the argument for defending the Eastern Bloc or the Balkans but an attack from Russia would be catastrophic for Russia and they would gain very little they don't already have through soft power. Even if the worst came to the worst Europe's military spending combined is much more than Russia's and defence would not be as big a problem as this author makes out. On the naval front the UK will have two aircraft carriers when they're built and a fleet of new jets to put on them. France has one, Italy has two and Spain...has decommissioned it's carrier...but still Russia has only one compared to our 5. I can't think of any power in the Atlantic that could threaten Europe's trade routes. Piracy is also being combated very successfully by European ships.   

Besides you don't need a huge standing army to deal with low level terrorism which is our most likely threat. The French army are disarming rebels in the CAR with 1600 guys. They defended Mali with a few thousand also. Libya was done with no ground troops what so ever. If Iraq and Afghanistan has taught us anything it's that sometimes large scale military occupations raise more problems than they solve. Maintaining small highly trained armies will suffice for all of Europe's needs. Intelligence, logistics and air support are things that could be shared. They are all tasks that don't put lives in very much risk and thus countries are more willing to it for each other. We already see this happening today. Europe can afford the reduction in militaries in defence of ourselves. If NATO wants the UK or whoever to project military power across the globe we should leave it because it would not be in our best interests. 

**TL;DR** Europe faces very few threats and those it does have could be defeated with small highly trained armies and co-operation on transport, intelligence etc. NATO can suck a dick.

Dazu, sich Gedanken darüber zu machen, wie es besser zu gestalten wäre, sieht man sich offenkundig nicht verpflichtet, wenn man dazu überhaupt fähig ist.  Dabei wäre gerade dies im Rahmen der Snowden-Enthüllungen dringend notwendig, denn ohne eine grundlegende Neugestaltung der Integration von Mandat und Beruf wird es nie jemand ins Parlament schaffen, der weiß, wie ein Computer funktioniert.  Im Gegensatz zur guten alten Zeit hat das Abgeordnetenmandat heute nicht mehr die Qualität einer Sache, die man mal so nebenbei erledigen kann.  Wenn man als IT-Fachkraft vier Jahre seinen Mandatspflichten nachkommen will, ist man danach arbeitslos, weil die Technologiekarawane uneinholbar weitergezogen ist.  Und nur weil man einmal in den Bundestag will, soll man doch nicht anschließend [putzen gehen](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/zweitkarriere-einer-parlamentarierin-die-rote-lilo-geht-putzen-1.182383) oder von vorn anfangen müssen, oder?  Die Deutschen sollten endlich einmal einsehen, dass ihr Verlangen nach Politikern, die den Job aus glühender Überzeugung für die Sache kostenfrei machen, eine Remanenz der Nazi-Propaganda ist, die den Hitler als asketisches Gegenbild zum Stereotyp des zigarrerauchenden Fettwanstjuden [stilisierte](http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article408407/Adolf-Hitler-Milliardaer.html), der noch auf seine Reichskanzler-Bezüge verzichtete.  Abgeordnete brauchen Kohle, wenn sie was bewegen wollen, und wenn sie die nicht auf regulärem Wege bekommen oder schon von Haus aus mitbringen, dann werden sie stets versucht sein, auf irregulärem Wege an sie zu gelangen.  Und wie im Radsport stechen hier die unredlichen die redlichen Wettbewerber aus.

Eine andere Frage ist die nach der effektiven Unabhängigkeit des Abgeordneten.  An den oft [beklagten Missständen](http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-65009825.html) hat sich nicht zuletzt deswegen nichts geändert, weil es den meisten Menschen egal ist, wie das Parlament funktioniert.  Wenn Parteien über die Landeslisten Lebensläufe ruinieren können und Fraktionsvorsitzende im Grunde walten können, wie sie wollen, ohne dass der einzelne Abgeordnete sich der Repressalien ob seiner Renitenz erwehren kann, braucht man sich nicht zu wundern, dass das Parlament eher den Charakter einer Abnickerbude hat, in der direkt Gewählte ein Dasein als Mauerblümchen fristen.  Aber auf Druck aus der Bevölkerung, der zur Behebung alldessen notwendig wäre, wird man vergebens warten, weil es nicht gerade darum geht, Ausländer draußen zu halten oder dem schießwütigen Amerikaner ans Bein zu pinkeln.

However, when reading some transcripts of Goebbels speeches for a paper, he seemed pretty crazy to me with all his talk about spirituality and etherical connections between people. At first this was quite confusing for me because I never realized that spirituality played such a big role for him, so I did some research. I don't think they were ""evil zombi necromancer nazis"" like sometimes implied in pop culture, but there are some indications that at least Goebbels, Hess and Himmler showed great interest in astrology, alternative medicines and esoterism. Also the enactment of NSDAP events did have many aspects that are best described as somewhat religious.

The entire banking system that the whole world has had since banking first started is based on this premise. If your money is in a bank, then you are (a) taking a risk on the credit of that bank or (b) taking a risk that your government will not guarantee your deposits (up to the amount of the guarantee). If you don't like these risks, then having a savings account is not for you. Happily, we are able to chose which bank we want to put our money in and different banks invest in different ways. Or, feel free to start another bank. Or, feel free to withdraw all your savings and put them in a different investment. Or under your mattress.

&gt; Who gave the power to EU to make decisions like locking down banks and using depositors money instead of owners, investors and advisors?

The governments of the Eurozone countries.

Technically, in an insolvency scenario, senior bondholders tend to rank pari passu with depositors. Thus if the depositors lost then the bondholders would also lose. The only way to give bondholders seniority to banks is to secure the bonds, but this tends not to happen with bank bonds. Some jurisdictions also have a depositor preference rule, though not most EU jurisdictions.

You can launch 10 nuclear missiles at one target escorted by 50 drones but if they encounter 100 similar drones they will fail.

Either way it would be an arms race that would culminate in neither side being sure of just how many such drones the other has or can produce while still keeping around a few hundred nuclear weapons. A situation far better than what we're currently enduring.


I'm sure you've played some RTS games and have noticed that even a single more unit will make an exponential difference as the battle goes on when the playing field is level and the technology more or less identical.

... etc etc etc ...

Par contre, il faut bien comprendre que l'impacte d'une révocation aussi rapide de l'IGC est fort: tout les certificats émis par l'autorité (qui sont probablement en tres grande majorité des certificats non corrompus), sont révoqués. Donc un impact important sur toutes les applications existantes. Ca ne se fait pas sans réflexion. Du coup ma réflexion est que si ils avaient voulu faire un coup d'espionage, ils auraient tout simplement créé une intermédiaire temporaire.

&gt; À moins de prouver qu'ils ont réagi aussi vite qu'ils le pouvaient, par opposition à réagir quand une tierce partie ait remonté le problème, on ne peut pas leur donner le bénéfice du doute.

Non mais tu penses qu'ils contrôlent ce genre de chose de manière proactive? Les mêmes mecs qui créent des certificats moisits auraient un processus de vérification fiable? Peu probable.

&gt; on ne peut pas leur donner le bénéfice du doute.

Je n'ai toujours pas vu de scénario de risque qui pourrait conduire à une attaque sur google. Il faudrait en monter un avant de justement accuser un organisme de l'état qui n'a rien a voir avec l'espionage francais, faire de l'espionage.

&gt; ""L'erreur humaine"" ça ne veut rien dire. Soit ils ont des process de merde, et ça m'étonnerais quand même un peu, soit ils se foutent de la gueule du monde, et ça ne m'étonnerias pas trop.

Ils ont sans doute des process de merde. Tu serais étonné a quel point les mecs de 40 ans et plus qui bossent dans l'administration ne comprennent pas ce qu'est un certificat et a quoi ca sert. C'est souvent vu comme une contrainte et les process sont rarement suivits.


Dans le cas présent je suppose plutot une erreur humaine lié en effet a des process moisits et des mecs qui ont autre chose a faire que respecter un process qu'ils ne comprennent pas qui est imposé par l'IGC/A qui ne leur sert a rien de leur point de vue et qui ralenti leur projet.

That's a pretty bold assumption there. So bold in fact, it reeks of bullshit.

&gt;In any case, something outrageous like Russia invading a European state - let alone a EU member state will surely do the trick to create enough leverage to fast-track an EU defense force.

So European governments should finally begin retooling their military and increasing their spending...after Russia has begun its invasion? I am guessing you are not a General. 

&gt;so I don't really see your point.

It seems your argument is Europe should be completely reactionary. It should only pursue a common defense strategy once a threat has been realized. Just letting you know, policy makers tend to want to anticipate threats and be proactive in addressing them. They do not want to wait for threats to materialize, then address them. That's completely bass-ackwards.

While all export inspections used to be by inspectors in government service, most of these have been privatized. Russia doesn't trust privatized inspections, there have been conflicts in the past about about plant exports to Russia which is a big market. The bottom line is that Russia wants the Dutch government to be the guarantor of certification, not private companies which would be more susceptible to economic pressure/bribery and which could be used as a convenient scapegoat in the case of veterinary or fytosanitary problems. So I do think the Russians have a point here. Self-regulation of an industry is always tricky.

It works, up to a point... A large elite from a small force is not going to be as selective as a small elite from a large forge. There is an inflection point, and some in the military believe we are crossing it.

Also, institutional knowledge is hard won and vanishes easily if you downsize too far - re-learning usually costs blood. Losses of capability caused by loss of institutional knowledge will add to the ones caused by material cuts.

Yes, as someone with Irish blood I feel terrible for you guys. But believe me, you got off lightly and have done brilliantly. Look at Portugal and Greece if you want to know what real austerity looks like. Also, the real economy is going to be picking up next year in Ireland just as it does in Britain. Ireland's economy remains closely linked to Britain's. Unemployment is already falling quite a bit in Ireland.

&gt; Also while Irish a very educated there is huge emigration of college graduates. It's been described as the 'lost decade' and in general brain drain. There are no future prospects for young people in Ireland.

Chemical engineering is relatively specialised. Yes, it's a pretty large industry in Germany, but how many chemical engineers do you need compared to, say, computer scientists or mechanical engineers? The general availability of programs reflects that, and those with English as the course language are only a small subset of them.

I wasn't offended, more amused as to why anyone would think that (well, frankly I mistook you for an American, because ""college"" and the question about reputation). We've had universities for a long time, long enough for German as the teaching language to have been a modernisation at some point (instead of Latin). It actually used to be one of the leading languages of science before the Nazis fucked everything up.  
It's a relatively recent development that students who fulfil the admission requirements can be expected to speak English well enough to follow lectures, and that German professors can be expected to hold them in decent English. There are enough native speakers for movies and TV series to get dubbed, and that makes a huge difference compared to, say, the Netherlands or Scandinavian countries where children learn English practically automatically simply by watching TV. It's similar in other European countries with large populations, university programs with English as the course language are recent developments to intentionally increase the degree of internationalisation. 

It's no coincidence that there aren't many in countries without tuition fees. Imagine what would happen if German universities would predominantly use English for teaching. Practically everybody speaks it, and the EU doesn't permit unequal treatment between EU citizens. We'd either have to charge German students tuition fees, or we'd have to provide free education to all EU citizens, even if they'd have to pay high tuition fees in their home country.  
For Master programs, the situation is a bit different, because that's when it's about attracting international talent. They're still predominantly in German, but there are many more programs in English than on the Bachelor level. Two years of tuition costs in exchange for a highly educated potential future tax payer is a more favourable cost/benefit calculation.",0,1386949719,null,0,false,0,ce0va2u,t3_1sslk5,t1_ce0va2u,t1_ce0tm8l,null,1428148581,5,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,5

I have noticed actually that in german&lt;-&gt;english there are some false friends in this regard.
Just translated literally: ""getting your fingers wet with something"", ""put hands onto something"", ""touch it with your own fingers/hands""
In german all of them mean to start something new, trying something out, doing it on myown. So there is no sexual attachment to these sayings.

I can understand that it's obviously masturbation, but I guess here it is meant as said. Sausages are something we're proud of here ;)

Remember we're on /r/SCHLAND, a similar tone as in /r/murica, where bacon is the one and only right way to eat.

With that comes the 2. point: Take the ""military-attitude"" of Germany and France for example. Because of it's history Germans are very reluctant to send their military anywhere else. Meanwhile France happily sends its forces to Libya, Mali and CAR. What would an EU Army do?

We can observe this already with the European Union Battlegroups, consisting out of divisions of alternating EU nations: It was deployed zero times. Simply because we are not sure when it's time to fight. For Germans it is very hard to image German troops fighting again in Northern Africa. For France it is simply its backyard (no offence).

Even closer cooperation is hard: If Germany would specialize in let's say AWACS air reconnaissance capabilities. Now Britain and France decide it is time for some action in [country] and ask the German AWACS to check out the air. Do they need to come and help because two governments not elected by the Germans decide it's war-time? 

When this situation happened in Lybia, the German crews were commanded to leave the AWACS planes and let others fly them. The German navy retreated its ships of the Libyan coast.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"In Britain we give generous benefits to everyone who is British for their entire lives whether or not they have contributed to the system. Often, these benefits are greater than what some working people earn. This means that lots of people on benefits have no reason to work and are actually disincentivised from working. In right wing circles we call this ""the benefits trap"". In my view, Britain needs to tackle this urgently, but my view is a minority one.

Welfare reform (like reform of most things) is actually very difficult in the UK. The conservative party do want to reform it, but they do not have a parliamentary majority and have to rely on their coalition partners, the Lib Dems, to get legislation through. We are now within sight of the General Election (and close to the European elections) and the Lib Dems, doing badly in the polls, will never conceed a drastic overhaul of the benefits system. So it just won't happen in this Parliament. The conservatives know that there is just no way they can win this argument at the moment at home.

As you correctly state, the question of benefits for non-British EU nationals is related to this one. Currently, as the law stands, an EU national from Ruritania can turn up in Britain and claim benefits on day one, with no intention of working, because those are the benefits that Britons have and to discriminate on the grounds of nationality is contrary to EU law. In almost no other country in the EU could someone do that, because in most countries they have a system of benefits to Ruritanians. We can just about get our head round Ruritanians coming here to work, but benefits? You can imagine how UK newspapers deal with that!

The conservatives think that they have a chance of winning this in Brussels. Even if they don't win this argument, they get a political advantage because, at a time of austerity most of Britain does not think we can extend our generous benfits to everyone.

In the long term, perhaps this kind of fight will start to resonate with the British people and they might come round to accepting benefits reform at home, which I think would be a good thing.

Employers generally have substantial flexibility, but I don't think this is tied to the official language of a country.

In fact it's getting more common for *only* English to be a requirement, not Danish: Maersk recently changed their official corporate language to English, and by default only English proficiency is screened in new hires, unless Danish is needed for a specific position (such as jobs relating to Danish law). This has caused a little controversy and some people allege it constitutes discrimination, because someone who speaks only the official language of the country (Danish) is excluded from a wide range of jobs. However employers argue that it is a practical requirement.

I don't know how you measure ""good"" versus ""bad"", but while I get your point, I think it's equivocal. Revolt might be a *faster* way of changing things, but it's not easier, nor without consequences. And those consequences in this instance would be measured in far poorer economic outputs for all parties involved. I don't know if you know quite how bad the situation is in Spain, but ""poorer outcomes"" would actually quite literally mean ""higher poverty rates"". 

&gt; Lacking in this tribalism, the frustration would be more diffused and confused, similar to the occupy-like protests we have seen.

I don't quite understand if this is a critique of the occupy-like protests (which have been the most the american populace have involved themselves in politics in quite a few decades), or an endorsement of the tribalistic-bordering-on-outright-xenophobia nationalism that is going on in certain places of Spain, and elsewhere in the world, but either way I think it's the wrong approach. When it comes down to it, these protests are a)tribalistic in nature (not good in any light from where I'm standing), and b) if they achieved their goal there'd be economic suffering for everyone **very much in contrast with the fantasy that drives these protests** (that they'll do much better if they split off). This is **not** a calculated sacrifice, like, say, when the majority of Spaniards elected the current government because he had adequately (from PR PoV) sold that he'd put in place austerity measures that would make things worse for a while with the promise of a better future.

Yup, up until the Nazis persecuted Jewish scientists directly and others simply didn't feel comfortable with the political environment anymore.

&gt; In many countries paving is restricted to summer months because in winter the compacted base will cool the asphalt too much before it is able to be packed to the required density.

Add to that the fact that they're putting it *onto a frozen surface* and this is just plain mad. Also, I really wonder how well the asphalt will adhere to bottom layers if there's a layer of ice between it that cools it down as soon as it's poured. You'd get cracking, followed by massive potholes in no time.

As others have said, corruption and siphoning off public funds are the only possible reason for this. I genuinely can't think of worse weather conditions to pave in.

It is hard to find accurate statistics on this question, both for Britons moving to rEU and rEUropeans moving to UK. It would not surprise me if many British people have moved to rEU, though the numbers do seem pretty high.

Personally I think free movement of labour is good thing, though as a middle-class educated person I have personally benefitted from it a huge amount having easily worked overseas, both in rEU and in Asia. I work in a sector where rEUropeans (other than the Irish) are not able to compete with me. I am able to get people to clean my house for much cheaper than I otherwise would.

I have no problem with US-EU military cooperation, and I embrace it, but I certainly disagree with any European country delegating it's national security to the US. That's outrageous to me. I understand that a small micronation may delegate its defense to a friendly neighbor, because anyway it couldn't do anything against an invasion, and has few interests internationally. But that an otherwise capable nation relinquishes its defense to the highly interventionist and world actor, the US, which can often have different interests, is ludicrous IMO.

The best thing Charles de Gaulle ever did as president was to tell the US army they can no longer stay in France. I totally agree with this. France has led its own foreign policy, sometimes the US agreed and participated, sometimes it didn't. Either way it allowed France the independence of doing what it felt was in its best interests. 

Now, certainly, there are some medium-sized countries in the EU with little international interests. And surely, an EU army would be largely dominated by France and the UK, and perhaps Germany. Thus any EU intervention using a Euro army may be seen as the big three using the smaller countries' resources for conflicts the smaller countries have no interests in. But ultimately, there is a common EU interest, and currently, the smaller nations are just relying on the US on the one hand, and the French and UK armies on the other for their safety (considering that without the latter, the EU would be practically defenseless). A large army has a lot of leverage in geopolitics, including economics. That's pretty unfair for France and the UK in my opinion.

true,rtharper,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; You think our immigration laws aren't open? There are 400,000 French people living and working in London! If you want to work in Britain, it is very easy to come here and do that.

I have a DPhil (in a *very* lucrative field) from the University of Oxford, I lived in the UK for 5 years. I come from another wealthy, developed, but non-EU country.  English is my native language.  In the time I lived in the UK, I watched the government change and take on an anti-foreigner bent so rapidly that I don't think anyone could have foreseen it.  It became nearly untenable (though technically still possible) to stay and work with any sort of security in my future in the UK.  I left when no company outside the City had the ability to sponsor a work visa or tried to use it as a reason to reduce their salary offer.  I am not alone.  I watched friends of various nationalities (including Commonwealth citizens from other English speaking countries, I might add) get legislated out of the country by a xenophobic government hellbent on kicking as many of us out as possible.  Most of them went to one of the top 5 UK universities, and usually one of the top in their field.  

So... fuck you.

Btw, I work for one of the fastest growing companies in Sweden, speak fluent Swedish now, and have actively attempted to integrate into society with success.  The same thing I was more than willing to do in the UK before xenophobic, populist wankers took control of the public debate.  

Your loss, as far as I am concerned.

true,rtharper,SWED,Sweden,"I am a software developer, the field of software dev in the city did not appeal to me (and I did many, many interviews).  Most other companies (including some rather prominent MNCs) were unwilling or unable to sponsor non-EU workers.  Many recruiters were unaware of the regulations and said, ""Can't you get one of those yourself?""

Most small to medium tech companies in Britain depended on the fact that highly-experienced, highly-educated people could get unsponsored work visas until they were withdrawn.  In addition, they squeezed the transition visas for doctoral students so that one had to have submitted, defended, corrected, and had leave to supplicate, a process that can take up to 1 year during which DPhil students usually no longer have funding.

Also, they took away all settlement rights for all post-study visas, and at the time I left there was a proposal to take away settlement rights for work visas and require that people request that their time count retroactively.  Living with that over my head when I really do not want to settle again in my home country made the situation too insecure and stressful. 

In Sweden, I signed my job contract and received a work permit in less than a month.  It required sponsorship, but any company may file the paperwork (in the UK you need special permission, as you probably know).  I will require no sponsorship after next year.  

I was very sad to leave the UK.  I loved it there.  It has no love for foreigners, as far as I can tell.  At least, not politically.

Swedish classes are free for all who come to Sweden, btw.  There is no assumption that one speaks Swedish when one comes to Sweden, though it is almost a necessity for staying here long term.  I think Britain would do well to similarly invest in English, actually.

Inizialmente mi sono informato per telefono. Il prezzo era buono e la spedizione era gratis. Ottimo. Faccio l'ordine sul sito e mi dice che la spedizione è 15€. Richiamo, mi avevano appena detto che era gratis! Si scusano tanto e mi promettono un paio di bacchette omaggio (valore 5€), ma vabbe, non sto a fare storie per 15€ che in relazione sono una miseria, gli indico il modello di bacchette che preferisco, modello 5A (le più banali e comuni). Facendo l'ordine metto come indirizzo di fatturazione quello di residenza, a Mantova (era rilevante, non ricordo perchè - forse perchè per quella cifra non potevo pagare con la carta di credito e ho dovuto fare un bonifico) mentre metto come indirizzo di spedizione Milano dove abito e dove la voglio usare.

Bene! Tempo tre giorni e la batteria arriva a Mantova. Fanculo. Nel frattempo mi avevano addebitato 25€ di spedizione. Fanculo^2 . Richiamo. La spedizione aumentata è perchè il pacco eccede i limiti di dimensioni (ma va? Imprevedibile proprio! Sono due pacchi di un metro cubo l'uno!!), e tante scuse sul destinatario sbagliato, riorganizzano un'altra spedizione e da Mantova me la rispediscono a Milano.

Altri tre giorni, il pacco arriva con un buco sul fianco grande come un pugno, e altri buchi, graffi vari qua e là.

Dico al corriere ""Io firmo, ma con riserva di controllo.""

Lui: ""No, non si può guarda. Devi firmare e basta.""

Io: ""Ma stai scherzando? Allora per me il pacco è danneggiato, riprenditelo!""

Lui: ""ehm... uhm... ma poi ci fanno storie!... ... va bene dai""

Vabbe... me la devo pure portare dentro a mano perchè la consegna al piano non era prevista. Mancano le bacchette. Richiamo. Si scusano. Me le mandano.

* Albania is still very corrupt and this has to be resolved before they get a candidate status.

* Organised crime in the country is rampant.

* The EU can not handle another ""weak"" member. We have enough problems already and have other issues to take care of.

This is partially true.  A lot of Britain's value is in its internationalism, and most of this is focussed in London.  This has been actively worked against by the Tories in their current government.  Applications from abroad for students has dropped precipitiously, and international tuition is no small contribution to the British economy.

Go to [Mitchell's Fold](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/mitchells-fold-stone-circle/), a bronze age stone circle which is free to enter and no one knows about it! Plus it's set in the hills of Shropshire so you get a good view of peaceful countryside. [Plus you get sheep strolling across your path.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le9zkqmb-Ck)

The [Roman City of Wroxeter](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/wroxeter-roman-city/) is a good place to go to too. They also built an accurate replica of a Roman villa. There's a museum on site of what has been found through archaeological digs, and the forum dedication which mentions the Emperor Hadrian (Roman emperor who visited Britain)! Also http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/properties/wroxeter-roman-city/gallery-for-wroxeter-roman-city/gallerywmwroxeter07.jpg

[Stokesay Castle is nice as well, a fortified medieval manor house!](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/stokesay-castle/)

The ruins of [Wenlock Priory](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/wenlock-priory/) and [Witley Court and Gardens](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/witley-court-and-gardens/) are other additions too.

There is much more to say though, of course. Like the [Severn Valley Railway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_Valley_Railway) which is a lovely scenic route through the Severn Valley.

Edit: Please see the places listed here as well http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wra-1356322685834/view-page/item726951/
&gt; **Attingham Park**
&gt; 
&gt; Built for the 1st Lord Berwick in 1785, Attingham Park is a mansion full of opulent furnishings and intriguing art in the form of the House of Beasts exhibition. [It has lovely grounds and is a fantastic stately home.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Sunnycroft**
&gt; 
&gt; Also, in north Shropshire, is the rare sub-urban villa and mini estate of Sunnycroft, transporting all visitors to the pre-World War Two lifestyle. [The woman who owned it died I believe, and the house was left untouched for around 80-100 years. There was an old car in the garage which hardly had any miles on the milometer, etc.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dudmaston Estate**
&gt; 
&gt; Amongst the southern Shropshire countryside lies Dudmaston Estate, a true mix of contemporary and modern art in a classic setting, surrounded by stunning parkland.

The scandinavian approach seems to be to give you unemployment equal to your previous salary, sinking downwards with time, I admit though I'm in no position to debate more or less generous, just the use of it in general here.  The benefits system is a lot more complicated than you seem to think. The NHS is straight forward, but the pension system can be difficult to calculate, and when we get into unemployment it becomes quite the hurdle.

There is JSA, housing benefits and tax credits. Getting these things is a hurdle in and of itself, for example you never know how much housing benefit you're going to get until you apply and it will never be the full cost of rent. Meaning that if you are looking for an apartment (after downsizing), you are never sure what you can afford. Then there's the fact that JSA is around 60 pounds a week, some of which inevitably goes to wards rent, which is a very tight budget, especially if you require transport. And the tax credits only come intro play when you're filling in your yearly tax accounts.

But the really bad part is, like I said, getting these things is  a hurdle. When my friend had to go through the process of acquiring she didn't even know she was eligible for tax credits, and it was a long and arduous process getting this in order, only to then find that she was screwed because her unemployment didn't really cover transport and food, considering she needed to move to a township outside the city, since not every landlord is keen on taking on DSS and that was within her budget.

So more or less generous, I don't know. But generous in general, no, and I'm sorry for anyone going through this process.

La mafia uccide solo d'estate è un gran bel film, è anzi un film che per il tema che affronta e per come lo affronta è di alto livello, costruito su un'idea di partenza apparentemente banale come un innamoramento tra i banchi, ma ambientato nella storia di una città, di un paese, di un'epoca che sono indimenticabili e fondamentali nella nostra storia come nella storia della Sicilia. 
E' un film che dissacra la mafia con un'ironia leggera, che toglie agli uomini d'onore la patente di leggenda che li ha sempre circondati per farli apparire talmente piccoli e talmente banali che ti chiedi davvero cosa avrebbero fatto senza che qualcun altro, molto più potente, molto più incisivo, con obbiettivi molto più grandi non li avesse manovrati, aiutati, coperti.

did you understand that?

....
it said...

""if there is an accident press the red button""

you really don't know what your talking about and your definitely not from the UK.

i will explain... as i have many times...
1. the first thing people do is have children when they arrive (all heath care is free)
2. all socal housing (which is to a high standard is free_
3. payments are made to you every week while you look for work (£70 each person) about 114.03 US Dollar

4. you are expected to look for work and will be given free English lessons which you do not need to pass exams.

5. Any work you do illegally is a bonus.

6. every child you have means you get extra money. as the government does not want children to suffer.

so this is how it works in money.

1.your rent is paid. £140 per week (228.09 US Dollar)
2. your money is sent to your back account and also you wife's bank account. £70 x 2 = £140 (228.09 US Dollar)

3. your fees for birth are covered (£2000 approximately) (3258.40 US Dollar_

4. you dentist, optician fees, and council tax are free (land tax is about £100 per month) more for bigger houses so ..(162.90 US Dollar)

5. you have one child and you are given £56 per week 
(91.24 US Dollar)

6. if you have another child you are paid £20 per week also. (32.58 US Dollar)

7. them you work illegally for about £200 per week, and your wife ""goes to English school, but never listens. so thats 600-800 per month. (1303.20 US Dollar)

ok, I know that the immigrants often have about 4 children so that £56 + £20 + £20 +£20 thats (185.73 US Dollar) each week! times that by 4 weeks (1 month and thats $740 per month.. lets add all this up..

$740 Child payments  + $912  rent payments + $912 cash payments + $116 land payments + £1303 illegal working.

that cost the good English people $2680 each month.
not including income tax evasion birth costs, $3000 each time... and other free health care like the dentist.

can you see why ""people want to come to England"" and why were so pissed about it?

try comparing that to benefits in your country.
I know women who are having children at 40 years old just to get extra money. its completely disgusting!

oh, and 4 children cost the UK 13032.00 US Dollar.

oh, lets not forget the cost of teaching 10 million people how to speak English, which they don't learn.
I expect that would be 814500000.00 US Dollar each year.

now, which country are you from?

Ensuite, j'ai un peu l'impression que les gars de chez *Advocate* (magazine LGBT, au cas où on ne l'aurait pas remarqué) déforment à leur convenance les faits et les propos de Barjot.

&gt; The comments came after a pro-gay activist was left brain-dead in June by a beating from extremists.

*Advocate* fait ici référence à l'affaire Clément Méric, et on sait depuis longtemps que le fait que Méric soit ""pro-gay"" n'a eu aucune conséquence sur son agression. Une bagarre entre *skinheads* et *antifas* avec deux bandes rivales qui ne demandaient qu'à avoir l'occasion de se tabasser.

&gt; ""This extreme fight is the result of a power that for nine months has refused to listen to the French people,"" she wrote for the French site Newsring, criticizing President François Hollande for pressing for the law. ""The president has caused extremism to grow by passing a law that the French didn't want, and in a manner that was authoritarian and undemocratic. When we refuse to act like a democracy, extremism grows. In a way, you could say that there was a death because of this denial of democracy."" 

J'ai retrouvé [l'article de Newsring](http://www.newsring.fr/societe/4097-agression-de-clement-meric-fait-divers-ou-de-societe/57439-clement-meric-cette-bagarre-entre-extremes-est-le-resultat-de-neuf-mois-dun-pouvoir-qui-a-refuse-decouter-le-peuple-francais) que cite *Advocate*. Le problème, c'est qu'ils ne citent que le début de sa tribune. 

Si on s'en tient là, on a en effet l'impression qu'elle dit qu'il fallait s'attendre à de telles violences. Elle commet d'ailleurs la même erreur qu'un Pierre Bergé en reliant l'affaire Méric à la ""Manif pour tous"", alors que comme déjà expliqué, cette mort n'a pas grand-chose à voir avec le débat sur le mariage homosexuel.

Maintenant, si on cite Barjot dans l'intégralité de son intervention sur cet article *Newsring*:

&gt; Je condamne toutes ces actions et ces violences, je condamne les propos de monsieur Bergé, et toutes ces façons de faire. Je n’ai d’ailleurs pas participé à la dernière manifestation, parce que je trouvais que les groupuscules d’extrême droite qui me menaçaient étaient trop présents et auraient pu venir, sous prétexte de ma présence, perturber des manifestants pacifiques.
On ne peut plus manifester contre, il faut combattre les fondements de cette loi autrement, avec l’Avenir pour tous, grâce auquel nous souhaitons réformer la loi Taubira de façon constitutionnelle. Le mariage homme-femme est garant de la filiation humaine, et remplacer le mariage pour tous par une loi d’union civile ouverte aux couples homosexuels. C’est la seule façon de faire baisser les extrêmes. C’est là qu’aujourd’hui se trouve le clivage.
En l'occurrence, je tiens aussi à dire qu’entre les skins et les redskins, il y a peu de différences sur la considération de la place des homosexuels dans la société. Ils se battent entre eux, mais aucun n’a fait en sorte que les actes d’homophobie soient moins importants. Je déplore ça avant toute chose : les extrêmes sont des homophobes.

Donc *Advocate* cite une intervention de Barjot où elle condamne les skinheads et renvoie dos à dos l'extrême-gauche et l'extrême-droite. Et le journaliste fait ensuite mine de s'étonner:

&gt;  So after marriage equality passed, it was all the more strange when she started asking for police protection from the antigay side. 

Alors même que Barjot déclare déjà craindre l'extrême droite dans l'article de *Newsring*: bref, si vous avez suivi, *Advocate* dénonce une incohérence des propos de Barjot là où il n'y en a aucune.

Quoiqu'on pense des arguments employés par Barjot, on a donc affaire à un magazine qui essaye de la faire passer pour une passionaria des groupes fachos homophobes en citant un article où elle condamne ces mêmes groupes.

Ils auraient au moins pu être un peu plus pertinents en citant son fameux ""Il y aura du sang !"" après le vote de la loi. Jusqu'à un certain point: elle a d'abord regretté publiquement ces propos, et il est ensuite difficile de faire passer cette formule pour un appel à un lynchage des homosexuels. Ce qu'elle veut dire par là, et qui est d'ailleurs explicité dans l'article de *Newsring*, c'est que le gouvernement aurait trahi la confiance du peuple français en votant la loi, et qu'il doit donc s'attendre à une révolte populaire / révolution. Vision des choses assez discutable, mais qui se positionne sur le plan des limites d'une démocratie représentative face à des revendications populaires; et non pas d'un appel à lyncher des gays.

Autrement dit, *Advocate* n'est pas spécialement convaincant quand il essaie d'expliquer pourquoi Barjot serait la ""5th biggest homophobe of the year"". Ce n'est pas tout à fait un hasard si les gars de la ""Manif pour tous"" ont placé à leur tête une fêtarde habituée des clubs gays parisiens: précisément pour éviter les accusations d'homophobie.

A moins qu'être opposé au mariage homosexuel soit considéré comme intrinsèquement homophobe... Connaissant la ligne actuelle de la plupart des associations LGBT, j'aurais tendance à penser que c'est la position adoptée par *Advocate*.

We feel very safe now that it's been several years since the death of Osama, over a decade since the Twin Towers fell and over twenty years since the Soviet Union dissolved. What's there to worry about? In this position of relative security we can all have a nice long think about war and armies and defence spending and morality, but when the international stage becomes tense again and people start feeling threatened then all that talk of morality and defence cuts will change to 'do whatever it takes to make me safe again'. It's completely understandable. There was a lot of opposition to Iraq as it happened, but it's almost universally considered a bad thing now that it passed, mostly because we're not scared of Saddam anymore and we know that the evidence for going in was fault. We (the pulbic) didn't know that at the time and therefor felt threatened and therefor felt invasion was necessary. Additionally before the Twin Towers felt people thought that intervening in foreign affairs was pretty unnecessary and maybe even morally wrong. The USSR was gone, what's there to be scared of? Nothing, that is until something happens as it did in 2001.

Same goes for someone you truly love suddenly ending a long-term relationship in which you were fully satisfied.  You don't want it to happen, but they do, and who is to judge whether they are in the right to do so?  You may think they are disadvantaging themselves in this decision, but clearly they don't.  It's their life, and inflicting emotional suffering on others is not a crime nor should it be.  Maybe your partner was depressed.  Does that give you the right to prevent them from making life-altering decisions?

Yes, LEDs are more complicated. But studies have shown that over their lifespan, however, they end up being much more eco-friendly than incandescents and CFLs. They need to be replaced about 10 times less often and are much more energy efficient during the decade they operate.

You are correct in that LEDs have a problem in scaling to larger power outputs. However, even though there is still work to be done in scaling and improving efficiency, even you mention that a current-generation LED is about 80% more efficient than its incandescent counterpart. That's a significant energy saving over the lifespan of the bulb.

true,thebrokendoctor,CANA,Swiss-Canadian,"The United States is undergoing a massive downsizing of its European commitments for a variety of reasons.

1) Budget. It is expensive to maintain the amount of troops and overseas bases that the United States has, and because it is already cutting large portions of the forces, it is looking for easy places to do it and Europe is one of those easy places. The US is also extremely tired of having to pay the bills for NATO over the past 50 years, and is pulling out to force the European members to start pulling their weight. 

2) Asian Pivot. China's on the rise, and the US has decided to go and focus on primarily naval and air operations in the Indo-Pacific to try and contain China's influence there. Coupling this with the downsizing of their forces, they have to pull more people from elsewhere to be able to go ahead with the bolstering, and as such we see a decrease in US forces in Europe.

3) Shifts in power in Europe. Germany's economic rise allows for them to pay for a bigger military and hold more power in the region, France's willingness to play buddy-buddy again with the US and throw its weight around to make it look more tough than Germany, and the end of direct threats to Western Europe have shown a decreased need for US involvement in Europe.

Giving this status doesn't change anything for your countries, it just changes for Albania, cause we would start new reforms as instructed by the EU, which would be good for us. But as an Albanian I believe that the real reason is not corruption. We have a lower crime rate than America. One Yes, we have corruption, but Southern Italy has corruption too, Romania and Bulgaria had more than we have now, when they entered. Greece has as much as us. Southern France is also very bad, due to Corsican mafia, and so on. Ukraine has more corruption and you guys are begging them to join you for not letting Russia take them. So, it's not corruption. We are also receiving a lot of unfair bad press from some British newspapers who are against the EU and the EU expansion, and they slander us just to prove their point, with titles like: ""Tony Blair will help Albanians immigrate in millions to the UK"", when we have a free visa regime to all Schengen and we are not emigrating, because emigration is not good anymore for us. It was good when our salaries were 60 USD per month, and a job in a western country would pay 1200 USD and 60 was nothing to send to your families. Now the salary is 400-600 USD in Albania, you can't save it from a western salary, with those high rents. It's better if we work here and avoid rent, and it's almost the same in savings. So, I don't think it's about corruption. Some of the reasons given by the Dutch MPs was the fact that we are members of the Islamic Conference and because we have 56% of our population Muslim, but they don't know that like 90% of our ""muslim"" population don't even follow religion, are very secular and religion is not a problem, and that we joined the Islamic Conference in 1992 right after the collapse of the communist regime, due to the immediate need for financial help, which we received from Turkey and rich Arab countries and which helped us a lot, because the west was not giving that much since we had not removed the communists completely. I think it is about this, and the lack of knowledge of the Dutch Parliament about the real situation in Albania. People here are as religious and as honest as in every other EU country, and we have as many corrupted people as other EU countries, like the ones I mentioned.

&gt;These are the heaviest sentences for financial fraud in Iceland's history.

There's a lesson here. You'd probably get similar sentence for stealing some change from shop cash register. So who wants to do some financial fraud with me? Assuming maximum 5 years sentence and say 50% failure chance, I'd say its worth the risk.

And the difference with arrest? When you steal a car worth 10k Euro, they'll come for you brutally, cuff you on the floor, maybe hit you once or twice when nobody's looking. 

Not with financial fraud. 

You may be sitting in your office, in a suit, then they'll come and ask you nicely to to walk out with them, they may symbolically cuff you, in front not in the back, and gently put you in a car. You may have just ruined thousands of peoples lives, stealing their life savings, but no matter. You deserve VIP treatment compared to the car thief.

This probably stems from the view that people in suits are more respectable, so if you're not good with financial fraud, and like breaking into places for example, always do so in a suit. I promise your arrest will be more pleasant, plus the confusion factor for the guards or police. They go into a closed warehouse expecting a thief and they find a guy in a suit?
