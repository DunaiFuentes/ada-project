Io nella mia carriera scolastica pur avendo fatto scuole che erano ritenute buone nella mia città ho incontrato (a vari livelli, partendo dalle elementari, fino alle superiori) diversi insegnanti, no, è il termine sbagliato, persone incompetenti.

Il dramma più grande sono gli insegnati di matematica/fisica, che non solo non sanno insegnare e stimolare gli alunni, ma a volte non sanno poi così bene neanche la materia, tanto da essere corretti dall' immancabile secchione della classe che, in più di un occasione, ci ha fatto risparmiare 20 minuti di imbarazzo totale dell'insegnante, non in grado di risolvere un problema da 3à superiore...

Vogliamo parlare degli insegnati d'arte che più la spari grossa più il voto si alza? che alla fine dell' anno l'unica cosa che ti hanno insegnato è ""se non sai l'argomento sparale grosse sperando di non fare pestoni""?

Fortunatamente ci sono anche insegnati capaci, ma capisci bene che basta poco ad un insegnate capra per distruggere anni di lavoro di un buon insegnante...
Sulla formazione non si scherza e in Italia è troppo tempo che si cerca di piazzare ogni cane che pretende di insegnare con conseguenti sprechi di risorse, che è il problema minore, ma soprattutto con una **qualità pessima** dell' insegnamento.

There are several factors at play in our economy:

- Sound fiscal management
- Solid resource demand
- Balanced budget at the time of the GFC
- And of course, the textbook perfect fiscal stimulus.

Indeed we are lucky that we have resources that are in demand. Yes, we're pissing them up the wall like no one's business because of our failure to capture the revenues from it. The consequence being that Gina Rinehart is now filthy fucking rich from the money that I and my fellow Australians rightly own, but other parts of the economy are suffering under our high dollar which is caused by mining.

But all of that aside, the question is this: Was fiscal stimulus appropriate? Did it serve our economy?

The answer to both is: Yes. 

Without it, we would have had serious problems. No amount of demand for our resources would have corrected for the damage to the economy. We would've had an exacerbation of the two-speed economy problem (which is already *bad*, and would otherwise be *catastrophic*). Our structural issues would have become serious problems.

Don't let some neoconservative cunt let you believe this is because of China wanting our resources. That helps, but it's not the reason our economy is still on the rails.

true,Svorky,SCHL,Schleswig-Holstein,"Let me explain why racial profiling is a bad idea, as best as I can.

Let's start with a hypothetical: There is a black population, there is a white population. Both have the same number of drug crime committed per 100 people. So if you stop a hundred white people and a hundred black people, you would expect to catch 4 people with illegal substances in both cases.

What happens when you use racial profiling? You stop 150 black people, and 50 white people. So now you would expect to catch 6 black people and 2 white people if crime rates were in fact similar.

In this case the crime rate in both sub-populations is still equal, in all your crime statistics it now shows black people as much more prone to crime though. (Note: You can counter that by checking against unsuccessful checks or checks per race, I have never seen a crime statistic do that, though. Might happen in other countries, I doubt it.) 

Now what does a police chief do? He reads the statistic, wants to help, so tells his policemen to keep a close eye on the black people. So they stop an even higher percentage of black people the next year, so their relative crime rate rises even more. Rinse and repeat.

So in short: With racial profiling, many times the crime rate of an ethnicity will appear higher even if it is in fact the same. The problem is that crime statistics are notoriously unreliable. As is the perception of crime.

No, not really for what you are suggesting. There are not workarounds for getting the Finns to start paying of Portuguese debt, and there are no workarounds inflation. People will start to pay attention if it starts to increase, it is not something you can hide. Nor can you force the richer populations to start paying for the investments that you need, they will notice X billions missing as well. So, I do not think so.

Why, it is the worst constructed ship I have ever seen? . I'd call it the Wasa ship of  the currencies (a Swedish ship, extremely expensive who sank around 20 minutes after it set sail, in 1628). One can not have a monetary union of such diverse economies without a financial one. And, one can not as you suggest, go through the back door, nor do I think one should, it is not right towards the people who has voted, people who think that the law should rule, and towards people who do not want a financial union, which I happen to believe most do not. Do you honestly think it is democratic to try to force it on people? Why? What gives anyone the right to set themselves above treatues? Which is the next law that we are going to ignore?

true,TheMania,null,null,"It's one of the very few ways out of this trap.

Currently, the Euro zone is trying to save en masse. Households/businesses/governments, they're all trying to save in Euros and/or safe Euro denominated assets.

The problem is, there's no entity that can supply them with those savings.

To see why, consider that countries cannot in aggregate export their way out of trouble. That's [mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism) - that every nation should export more than they import, bringing more Euros into the nation - clearly, this is impossible. The nations with weaker export sectors will lose Euros to those with stronger export sectors.

The problem is, households/businesses (the private sector) still desire to net save Euros, despite that their nation cannot bring them in from outside. If the private sector succeeds in this goal, then the public sector must necessarily be running a deficit. That's the only way that the private sector can run a surplus (net save) if they're not getting those Euros from outside the nation, is by extracting them from the government.

Additionally, households/businesses have great control over their individual budgets, their own spending decisions. The government does not - it has to put up with automatic stabilisers (such as income tax, welfare) dictating much of its budget to it. What this means is that out of the private sector and the public sector, the private sector will typically be the one to win in this tug of war over who gets savings, and who is forced to dissave.

What you're left with is the problem that unless your country has a strong export sector, if the private sector is to succeed in net saving - the public sector is forced into running a deficit.

See the problem? There's no way that households/businesses and governments across the Euro zone can stably save at once, for there's no entity that can sustain deficits. Eurobonds or a federal government would change this. Once you have a bond that's backed by the ECB (ie, it would sooner be printed than defaulted upon), it is inarguably the safest investment one can make with Euros. The safest investment must necessarily go for the lowest interest in the economy, an interest rate that the ECB itself sets. Once you have the capacity to issue bonds that you *know* will always go for a high price, the only limit on your spending is the economy's capability to rise to meet it. Try and spend too much and you get inflation, not enough unemployment, but never are you limited by taxation revenue.

A federal government, funding itself with taxes + Eurobonds, could ensure that at all times everyone has sufficient money to afford their taxes, put aside their savings, and have enough disposable income to spend sufficient for full employment.",0,1367857310,null,0,false,0,c9thf72,t3_1dsi8z,t1_c9thf72,t3_1dsi8z,null,1431284815,23,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,23

Ich hab es eher so verstanden, dass die Kritik dahin geht, dass sie ihn das machen lassen. Jemend aus einer anderen gesellschaftlichen Klasse hätte eben nicht die Möglichkeit dazu (mangelndes Interesse von Medien und vielleicht auch von den Lesern, wie du schon sagst). 

Also wird die Andersbehandlung aufgrund von Zugehörigkeit einer gesellschaftlichen Klasse kritisiert. Kann ich nachvollziehen und finde ich nicht so sehr verschwörerisch. Wenn mein Bekannter in der Bild öffentlich kritisiert wird, weil er beim Wohngeld betrügt wird ihm niemand die Möglichkeit bieten sich öffentlichkeitswirksam zu Entschuldigen und Rechtzufertigen. 

Das kann man als Unfair empfinden. Ich empfinde es auch als unfair. Und dafür kritisiert er die Medien. 

Dafür, dass jemand, der mutmaßlich eine Straftat begangen hat als Opfer stilisiert wird und eine persönliche Betrachtung erhält mit entsprechender entschuldigender Rethorik und Menschen die vielleicht aus purer Not und Verzweiflung Gesetzungsverstöße begehen werden medial zwar ebenfalls großflächig skandalisiert aber diesen Menschen wird eben keine Stimme gegeben sich zu erklären. 

Er zitiert ja die Bild Kampagne gegen ""Florida Rolf"" wegen der sogar das Gesetz verändert wurde. Dabei hat sich Florida Rolf völlig rechtmäßig verhalten z.B. im Gegensatz zu Höneß.

Is that your argument to invde Finland. It is so stupid that I am stunned.  First of all, you are talking about very small sums. Second, do you know what a bond is? One is *supposed* to make money from bonds - every single country have them, and other countries/banks/financial institutions buy them as a sort of investment. So I bet at least 50 countries own Greek bonds, and hundreds of financial institutions. Greece probably has Swedish bonds to, and makes money from them, albeit less, since Sweden is seen as a securer market. Are you going to invade everyone. You honestly do not seem to have the tiniest graps of the financial market-  it is a good thing when someone buys your country's bonds. How much money has Greece made from bonds they have in other countries over the years? A lot I bet- as it should be, that is how the market works. Third - you are supposed to make money from bonds, *that is the point of bonds*. I promise, At least 75 countries have bought bonds in my country - why should I be mad about that? Why are you mad about bonds? 

Fourth - you seem to be implying that Greece somehow deserves free money from other countries in the EU, above what they are already given as a net receiver, even though it goes against the Maastricht treaty. Why does Greece deserve free money?  Why can't Greece pay off their debt, Finland theirs etc- you seem to think it is all right and proper that a Finnish tax payer pay off Greece debt. 

Fifth - as the article in the top here says, countries within the Eurozone has lost, compared to countries outside. So, Finland, has lost in comparison to their Nordic neighbours Denmark and Sweden, and trust me, they have loist a lot more than 360.

I have two counter-points to make:

1. Your stance only looks at the problem from a limited perspective and creates a strawman out of those who disagree with you. Yes, democratic legitimacy is important, as is having rules and following them. No one here is seriously arguing that we should create a fiscal union or federalise or any other important decision like that without the people's consent. 

2. You should also know, as cbr777 rightfully pointed out, that what we had so far was an absurdity: a monetary union without any political control. This information was not really known among the population although the ""powers that be"" were keenly aware that the situation was unsustainable from the start. So, in effect you're arguing in defence of an impossible state of affairs that could only exist temporarily.

The public sentiment is no doubt not as angry as it was. But public sentiment and objective material conditions rarely coincide. 

Allow me to take apart your claims one by one:

&gt; GDB-DEBT Ratio quickly going down

The debt-GDP ratio is actually increasing both because the GDP is getting smaller and because debt in terms of euros is getting higher. 

&gt; foreign investors going back to greece

Unsubstantiated claim. There's nothing to this except some feelgood stories on the domestic and foreign media. Bring me some investment data and then we'll talk. 

&gt; Greece government starting to privatise such as the 1 billion$ for 33% of greek lottery this week 

First of all, it was only 650 million. Second, the privatisation will start incurring a loss in 3-4 years. I see nothing to celebrate unless you're one of those ""everything should be privatised"" weirdos. 

&gt;  record tourism this year

You do realise that the tourist season has not even started, right? This is just an overconfident prediction. 

&gt; massive initiatives in various business sectors such as food and shipping 

Vague rhetoric that means nothing. Any concrete examples? Or even better, any data that shows it's better than it was?

&gt; Greece making multi-billion$ deal with CHina to setup Piraeus Harbor which will create 100,000+ jobs

Observing the government making large deals could mean lots of things. It could mean that they're just having a fire sale. If you were bankrupt and sold your house, you wouldn't call it a positive sign just because it was a large deal, would you? The 100,000 jobs is, again, just an overconfident prediction.

&gt; Creating a Tax Prison

Do you realise that [debtors' prisons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_prison) are against international agreements on human rights?

&gt; already jailing dozens of well-known figures

Yay, scapegoats! There's more to the rule of law than a few well-known ex-powerful figures going to jail when shit hits the fan. 

&gt; Greece posting a 750 million$ surplus the last 3 months.

First, it's a primary surplus, not a normal surplus. So, it's a surplus if you don't count interest payments. This is the only genuinely positive thing on your list, although it's still debatable. In order to make the primary surplus, the government did an unofficial suspension of payments for tax returns, suppliers and even some public sector employee wages.

He's willing to work with the mainstream left, but he obviously wishes to differentiate himself from the mainstream, especially if its in government, or else he wouldn't be relevant. Granted though, he's gathering support from some mainstream leftists who did vote for Hollande (instead of him - Mélenchon ran for presidency too..) and are disappointed. But that's pretty normal. 

I'm not trying to defend Hollande. I didn't vote for him.

I do think however that Hollande is pretty much fucked.

However, I am rather confident I am winning in the real world, people can't ignore the signs anymore, and both the EU and the Euro are loosing in popularity. So, I'll take the downvotes here :-). 

&gt;&gt; No one here is seriously arguing that we should create a fiscal union or federalise or any other important decision like that without the people's consent. 

Yes, really, people are. They keep saying that they want a real federal Europe  with all of what it entails, but that we do not have time for votes, and that some debt sharing should be fine, or you know, why not abandoning the ECB rules etc, (or my personal favorite, democracy is bad, it lead to Hitler....)When you ask them how however they are planning on building a federal union without the rule of law and where (most likely) a majority of the people want out  they do not really have answers. So, the do not say that they want dictatorship, but they say we should pool the debt, ignore the ECB rules and give more money to the south - immediately. That sounds an awful lot like a fiscal union to me - which is against the treaty, and I also believe against what most everyone, at least up north but also a lot in the south as well, want. 


&gt;You should also know, as cbr777 rightfully pointed out, that what we had so far was an absurdity: a monetary union without any political control. This information was not really known among the population although the ""powers that be"" were keenly aware that the situation was unsustainable from the start. So, in effect you're arguing in defence of an impossible state of affairs that could only exist temporarily. 

Yes, I agree that it is an absurdity, the most idiotic of currency unions. That is also the reason why it should be abandondend or at least that a lot of countries should leave.. However, you are wrong about the information not being known in the population. I am old enough to remember the Swedish referendum of 2003 and the fact that it was a poorly constructed currency was one of the main arguments from the No side (who won obviously). However, you might be right about it not being known, as in that is not the reasons people voted no here, it was probably more an ingrainded, deep sucspicion towards the EU and thinking they want more money from us (rather correct suspicion I'd say as well). Now, you might say that Swedes are the most intelligent of creatures :-), but I am sorry, we are not. The poor construction was known, it was however ignored both by the population and the politicians in a lot of places. A lot of countries should have had more honest politicians, or sometimes I think it was just honest optimism, better informed ones.  

&gt;So, in effect you're arguing in defence of an impossible state of affairs that could only exist temporarily. 

But what you are arguing for, a fincancial union without democratic support would be even shorter. And, I have not doubt, crueler. 

Besides, what I am arguing for is a much smaller Euro, or a complete abandoning of it. I don't think that the countries who leave the Euro should be thrown out of the EU though, I am sure one can re-enter the next day or so. I think supporting a badly constructed currency is madness, and trying to help it by going against current law and treaties makes it even worse. If we abandon democracy, what can we really build?

&gt;By the way, where were you when Greece was getting ridiculed for wanting a referendum on the loan agreements? Everyone at the time was like ""the people don't know what's good for them and therefore we should decide for them"". A bit of a double standard there, eh?

I agree, wasn't one Reddit then. I would have been on your side. I personally think Greece should have left as soon as the crises hit, you could have been well on your way to recovery now, instead of the prolonged suffering that you are having now. And, yes, you had a right to vote about it, but I also personally think the Germans had too, it was and is against the treaty really, not to mention billions of Euros.

true,bbmm,null,null,"&gt;Do you not know that Turkey imprisons the most journalists in the world. And they have the gall to call them selves a democracy. 

Actually no I don't know that.  Nobody knows that.  We don't know how many the more closed countries jail or if they really have any real journalists to jail.  This mantra (that's pushed from Turkey too) that goes like ""Turkey jails more journalists than China and Iran combined"" is annoyingly misleading and implies we know just what the hell goes on in China and Iran.  

That said, there are not only problems with the press but there are _enormous_ problems with freedom of expression here -- the press is just a symptom and they know how to be loud about it.  It is just the wrong metric that's used and repeating that gives the gov't an easy out while responding: ""if a journalist does X that's a crime, is he immune from prosecution?"" etc. etc.  Ditto for academics (they jailed a female prof for a while too, there), stressing that profs get jailed and fussing about that does get the prof out but really helps nothing towards solving the general problem.

Trust me, we understand the problems here in Turkey way better than they can be understood from the outside (if you can read Turkish then you may be able to follow from the outside, otherwise no chance).

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt;Yes, really, people are. They keep saying that they want a real federal Europe with all of what it entails, but that we do not have time for votes, and that some debt sharing should be fine, or you know, why not abandoning the ECB rules etc, (or my personal favorite, democracy is bad, it lead to Hitler....)When you ask them how however they are planning on building a federal union without the rule of law and where (most likely) a majority of the people want out they do not really have answers.

Please don't let the stupid Europhiles give us all a bad name. They're definitely out there, but they're by no means representative of those that believe in a Federal Europe. I've met a fair few stupid English people, but I don't think that those people that I met were at all representative of the English. It turned out they weren't and that the English people are a diverse group of people with such a wide range of views between them that it's impossible to imagine that they can all agree on the same thing. That's because they're different people with different views. 

On top of that, it's always the most radical that one remembers. I know there are some really crazy people in the pro Europe club and some really crazy people in the UKIP/Euroskeptic club, however I try and remember that those people are not representative. They're the fringe people. 

I can assure you, I'm pro Eurobonds and pro democracy. I'm pro federal and pro referendum. I think if the majority of a nation disagree with me, that I shouldn't get my way.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;No need. Fiscal / banking unions are complex legal challenges. Some experts on the EU law claim no new treaties are needed, some object... but there is absolutely no certainty at the moment about this issue. 


Fiscal unions goes against the Maastricht treaty. Debt pooling and transfers are aginst the treaty. 


&gt;After showing you that the Finnish tax payer is better of exactly because of Greek troubles? 

No, they are not. If so, you mean that anyone who buy Greek bonds are better off, when the case is, that most people do not want Greek bonds, just because they are so risky. The Finnish tax payers could have pehaps made a better deal elsewhere. They bought Greece bonds to be nice. To be quite honest, Greek bonds are not the best of investements. And, like I told you, the Finnish tax payers are not better off., they are in fact worse off, like [this](http://commissionideas.blogspot.fr/2013/05/lse-study-self-fulfilling-crisis-of.html) study implies, in comparison with their neighbours, Sweden and Denmark who also do not have to borrow money to lend to Greece, which Finland did. How is that better off? The Finns do not compare themselves to the Greeks, they obviously compare themselves to their Nordic neighbours, just like the Netherlands compare themselves to Belgium.

&gt;You are free to leave. It will be much, much better for all that you leave if you want to block something that is terribly needed for a long-term viability of the eurozone. And, believe me, you do not want Greece &amp; Co. out of the eurozone. Then all that bonds would be lost in the rain of Drachmas.... with majority of northern banks. Then the real bill for the Finnish taxpayer would come.

You did not answer the question. How are you going to build a financial union if people don't want to, and it is against the law? How long do you think such a union will last? Do you prefer dictatorship to democracy? 

However, you are wrong, if you think it is just the Finns blocking. To change the Maastricht treaty you need 26 countries to vote, and a new treaty - that will take decades, and most countries will vote no.


&gt;And, believe me, you do not want Greece &amp; Co. out of the eurozone. 

Personally I do, but not really just Greece, I believe either the north or the south have to leave since the economies are to different. Personally, I think it is better if the north leaves but that is just me. 

I think the Euro is an extremely poorly constructed currency, and trying to save it by breaking the law and treaties will lead to even worse results, trying to aim for dictatorship is really never the solution. I think it should be abandonded, or made significantly smaller. 

&gt;Then the real bill for the Finnish taxpayer would come.

Yes, but then they pay it and are out. Otherwise they will just keep paying for the foreseable future.

Representative democracy: As opposed to direct democracy consists of electing representatives to vote in a way they see fit instead of how you tell them to vote (like a delegate would). The main arguments in favour of representative democracy are that government officials who deal with these things day to day will be able to come to a decision much better than those who are not in touch with it day to day are. Furthermore, in theory, representatives will be much better educated (in respects of their job) than those who are electing them. This means they'll be much better able to make complicated decisions because they have a better understanding of the outcomes and requirements.

There is another option. Wealth transfers for sovereignty. If a country needs wealth transfer or fiscal transfer to float then they will give part of their sovereignty and European administration will replace national politicians and bureaucratic until the country and its economy is fixed.

&gt; The other option is to terminate the Euro and everyone goes back to their own currencies, that works to as far as I'm concerned. You seem to be under the impression that I care about the Euro, I don't. What I care about is a solution out of this mess, if that means ending the Eurozone I'm absolutely fine with that, but if creditor countries still want to keep the Euro than they need to get on with the fucking program and accept the fiscal union already.

Terminating Euro would actually decrease European competitiveness in global markets, because European companies would have to pay more transaction and risk coverage costs. Essentially it would wreck havoc in small countries that are very interlinked with big economies such as Germany. 

By the way the real solution to this whole Eurozone crisis is good old free market capitalism.

An important thing he has done is improving the self esteem of the society and though I consider him a dictator, the fact that his rhetoric is about making Turkey a democratic and free country is exactly what will keep hem from converting Turkey into theocracy.

What I hate most about him is the immense pressure on the freedom of expression put through questionable prosecutions and the immunity of the police. they are reckless when people are protesting the government. Erdogan quickly fires the officials that are not fully in his side, so everybody holding an important position in the government is trying their best to prevent anything that may upset him. Maybe Erdogan himself does not gives orders to prevent protest and so on, but the officials are quick to prove loyalty  by oppressing anybody that criticizes Erdogan. People in the opposition are beaten, thrown in jail all the time. The ""justice system"" works surprisingly well  when the offenders are against Erdogan and is incredibly terrible when the offenders are supporters of him. People stay in jail for years before the court decides that they are not guilty when people that write bad things on facebook about Erdogan are prosecuted and sentenced quickly. The supporters of Erdogan are often prosecuted out of jail(bailing out on bond) and often receive the least punishment possible by the law if the evidence and public attention does not let them to get away with it.  There are numerous pedophiles, drug dealers, rapists, murderers that were affiliated with Erdogan and got away with ridiculously light sentences.

However alcohol is not cheap(almost 2 euros for a bottle of beer in the supermarket, compare that with Germany), considering the income of an average citizen. Also, alcohol is getting regulated more and more strictly. More and more places are prohibited from selling alcohol.

For an example, there was huge protest in my University when Erdogan visited the campus. The police gassed the peaceful protesters and and the 3000 police officers chased and beaten students till late night.

Few months later, the licenses of selling alcohol in the recreational facilities of the University got canceled. It's was already not possible to sell alcohol in the campus but these facilities that are away from the main campus are used to generate income to the University and many interpreted this as a punishment against the University, that protected it's students during the media shit storm about police  brutality.

I wouldn't compare the two, but I would say that sometimes they have similar qualities. They're both organs of a government; they're both made up of people; they both have important jobs in the legislative process; ect. They share *very little* but there are some things which make them similar, even if those similarities are very shallow. The fact that they're both forms of appointed government is just one. 

Either way, I'm still not that bothered about them being appointed bodies for the reasons mentioned. *However*, I would like for the commission to have a smaller monopoly on power in the EU.

As for rental cars, pepecar is a cheap rental, they usualy have multiday deals allowing rentals of a decent car like a ford fiesta or a WV Polo for around 13 euros a day (does not include fuel, insurance and other costs), a larger sedan like a Seat Toledo or Open insignia might cost around 40 euros a day,

If you mean aid - you do not agree then with the title of the thread and you are against a financial union? Do you think countries voluntarily would pay off each other debt? While they are themselves in trouble, like France and the Netherlands? Honestly, it is very, very naive. 

So, the scenarios I gave are not uinlikely  -in debt sharing the Estonians *will* have to pay off the Portuguese debt. That is what a financial union entails. And, countries *will* loose more of their financial indpendence. 


Also, the ""aid"" is not voluntarily - do you really think Finland and Estonia has the free choice to say no? The ""aid"" is not voluntarily given, not at all. Most of the people do not want to give it - I know my country was given shit for not just taking part of the banking union, and Finland is constantly berated for trying to get collateral since ""everyone"" apparently says that they are supposed to sign it off.

Always, it's some combination of the three. If demand for bonds drops in some countries (such as the troubled southern countries) then it tends to flow to countries that are views as 'safe' such as Germany or Finland. This means that Finland and Germany start borrowing money at cheaper rates than they normally would, making the eurozone crisis beneficial for the borrowing rates. The ratings are a reflection of the strength of their economies (although Finland's economy is a little sketchy these days), but that is only loosely related to the interest rate on bonds they issue. They would be at a certain price if there was no eurocrisis, and they are at a lower rate during the eurocrisis because safe bond investment areas are drying up leading investors to accept lower interest rates in exchange for the safety of the Finnish and German economies.

As to your commend about Sweden and Denmark, that is like comparing apples and oranges. You cannot compare why Idaho is doing badly to California, and then compare it to both Mexico and Canada, it's not an equal comparison because they function entirely differently.

Granted, you said you aren't after visiting old churches, but despite that Wrocław has a lot of them, it's much more. Passing hands from Polish Piasts, to the Kingdom of Bohemia, to Austrian Hapsburgs, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire, Third Reich and finally back to Poland, it's a melting pot of many cultures which is clearly evident through its architecture. Because of 12 islands, 112 bridges and numerous streams and canals, Wrocław is called the Polish Venice and said to be the fourth or fifth in Europe in this category. We also have [one of the biggest old town square in Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Square,_Wroc%C5%82aw) and many other landmarks worth seeing -- including [The Centennial Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_Hall), designed by the famous Max Berg and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

And then, there's polish cuisine. You'll get a chance to try out our famous [kiełbasa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kielbasa), available at every butcher's shop, or [pierogi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi) (dumplings) served in many venues.

And if you're not an early bird you'll appreciate the fact that [Wrocław never sleeps](http://www.wroclaw-life.com/wroclaw/nightlife). Many pubs are open round the clock, especially in Pasaż Niepolda - quite a small square consisting of variety of pubs and clubs.

The woman cries 'oh God, is there anything I can do?' 

To which the doctor replies - 'Well I suppose you could move to Zurich.' 

'Zurich?' The woman asks quizzically. 'Will the alpine air, clean living and high standard of living give me a fighting chance against this disease.' 

'No' the doctor replies, 'You only have 6 months to live, but if you live in Zurich it will seem like 10 years.'

Este jueves se votará en las Cortes de Aragón la polémica ley de lenguas propuesta por PP, que muy probablemente será aprobada teniendo en cuenta que tiene el apoyo tanto del PP como del Partido Aragonés (PAR).

La nueva ley prácticamente elimina tanto el catalán como el aragonés y los deja sin ningún tipo de protección por parte de la administración. Por un lado, implica la derogación de la anterior ley de lenguas, que reconocía, por ejemplo, la existencia de los catalanohablantes de la Franja, aunque mantenía el español como única lengua oficial. Y por otro, sustituye los nombres de las lenguas por unos sorprendentes eufemismos: el catalán pasará a llamarse 'lengua aragonesa propia del área oriental' (Lapa), y el aragonés 'lengua aragonesa propia de las Áreas pirenaica y prepirenaica'(LAPAPYP).

Además, el catalán dejará de ser oficial en los topónimos de la Franja. Esta ley, propugnada por la presidenta de Aragón Luisa Fernanda Rudi, junto con la consellera de Enseñanza Dolores Serrat, que curiosamente nació en Ripoll y vivió allí durante su niñez, ya ha sido debatida en comisión parlamentaria durante ocho meses, pero no sin polémica: los partidos de la oposición han acabado abandonando la comisión por falta de consenso. Esta aprobación tan rápida de la ley contrasta con la tramitación de la anterior, promovida por el gobierno del PSOE de Marcelino Iglesias, que tardó ocho años en pasar de anteproyecto a ley, a pesar de que era una exigencia del estatuto de autonomía aragonés, aprobado en 1996.",0,1367883769,null,0,false,0,c9tqwld,t3_1dtrjy,t1_c9tqwld,t3_1dtrjy,null,1431280275,6,false,es,t5_22i2,6

My sense is that the education system in places like Germany and Switzerland is very unique, in that it is designed to train people for the jobs that are available out there. This is different from the USA. Here in America, educators since the mid-1900s have been very much against doing anything but training kids to be thinkers - in the false hope that everyone can be a doctor or a lawyer, or what have you. The practice of ""tracking"" (kids deciding on a course of study which leads to trade skills) is very taboo among US educators.

I saw a segment on an German language show comparing both academic achievement as measured by test scores and economic successfulness in both Greece and Germany. Greece comes out much better on the OECD figures for academics, but of course, Germany comes out better on the scale of being successful economically.

My conclusion from all this is that *what you build, you will get.* If you train kids to only be able to take tests and write essays, you'll have a deficit when it comes to people who actually do things that make money in a country. 

Yes, I understand the narrative which is commonly talked about here in the USA about it being cheaper to manufacture overseas and thus everything is outsourced. However, there's a fallacy in that model. Just because you outsource one kind of manufacturing, doesn't mean that you necessarily will have to outsource everything. If you have a supply of highly trained workers, they and the investors will be able to come up with innovative products that can be made competitively within your country.

It just shocks me what has happened to the city of Detroit, for example, after the long demise of the American auto industry. It's a rusting city which is emptying out. This just shows a dangerous lack of adaptability in the American economic system.  In the UK, they also had to go through a huge shift in what goods they manufactured, thirty or forty years ago... but they didn't just give up.

Well, once Airbus gets around actually delivering them, we're going to have A400Ms, at last. 

Of course, they're primarily tactical transports (rather short range, but able to land on short grass fields) and only incidental strategic transports (long range). It's probably faster to ship materiel with standard container ships over long distances, so forget about using them for power projection.

When it comes to refuelling, there's -- additionally -- the A330MRTT. For the rest, capabilities are there, too. In general, capacities could be scaled up quite quickly if shit decides to hit the fan because the tech is there.

It's not like nothing is done hardware-wise, and neither is *any* military in the world able to go against Europe, in Europe.

And the ""in Europe"" is the key point, here: The NATO can, with all due respect, go fuck itself when it comes to serious power projection in bloody peace times. It just ain't gonna happen. If the US wants to spend money they need anywhere else but in military spending on power projection then they're invited to do it alone.

*.....*

A large part of that is **because of** NATO and the United States' commitment to Europe's defense. But with the United States' ""pivot"" towards Asia, the last vestiges from the days of the Cold War and the Fulda Gap are all but gone. The game is changing, and Europe needs to change with it before it's too late and the whole continent stagnates. 

&gt;The NATO can, with all due respect, go fuck itself when it comes to serious power projection in bloody peace times. It just ain't gonna happen.

So if America or Canada are attacked, than Europe is willing to immediately abandon us? Do you not understand that this is a **North Atlantic** mutual defense pact, not a **European** mutual defense pact. It is unfair as fuck that the issue of defensive power projection falls solely on the United States' shoulders. 

NATO does not mean my country is here to protect *you*. NATO means we're here to protect *each other*. At the moment there is a huge ocean that separates the United States from your continent, and as it stands now, it is a one way street with the only country able to successfully conduct operations across it being my own. The non-existent power projection of the majority of European NATO members means you are all but useless and unable to help us should either my country or Canada come under attack. You're almost completely incapable of upholding Article 5. 

&gt; If the US wants to spend money they need anywhere else but in military spending on power projection then they're invited to do it alone. France and the UK dabble a bit with it because of their overseas territories, but that's it.

The United States, the UK and France are pulling all the military weight for the entire continent. My country isn't even **IN** Europe. The Fulda Gap, Kosovo, Libya, Mali, it is almost always those three countries pulling the majority of weight, with token support from other European countries. 

*This is not fair.* 

The E.U. has the world's largest economy and five hundred million citizens. Yet, the majority of the military hard power is pulled by merely two of your member states and a foreign country. That would be like if Texas and California pulled the entire military weight of the United States, with the fucking United Kingdom doing everything else for us. 

If you want a united Europe, a powerful Europe, one that won't be merely a soft power to be bullied around by not only my country, but China and Russia as well, where you're capable of protecting your boarders *(North Africa and the Middle East arn't the friendlest of places)* and able to respond to internal conflicts *(like you know...fucking shit like Bosnia &amp; Kosovo)*, than you need to consolidate and actually get your shit together militarily. 

&gt;Threat swagger is an American, not European, doctrine.

No, it's reality. Realpolitiks. Feelings and what you *want* to happen are great, but it's fantasy. Plus, don't make me give you a history lesson on Europe. You should already be aware how wrong that statement is if you've read up on the past 1,000 years of European history. Or fuck, the last one hundred. Hell, actually, the colonial empires were still around into the 60s, so change that again to the last 50.

To get a similar sized army to the US we would need to spend 100% of out budget on defence. 1 in every 30 men in the country would need to be in the army. It would be ridiculous. We will never be able to defend the US and Canada but it was never really about that. It was about the nukes and demonstrating a united western front to Russia which is now just a poor backwater with big ideas run by a criminal. They pose no threat and thus NATO is unnecessary except for being international peacekeepers which Euro has neither the economic strength (for a few years at least), and more importantly and permanently, nor the willingness. China will dominate the east, the US will dominate the Americas and the South Pacific and the EU will dominate Europe. 

I would hope we would be able to defend ourselves thoroughly especially in alliance with other EU nations. Combined France and the UK have a larger military budget than Russia and if other EU nations increase their budgets and we combine the forces they would be more than sufficient to defend Europe from more or less anything. Bosnia was a very complex scenario where the EU had brokered basic peace agreements at many moments and every move was made with an excuse. There was never a watershed moment to intervene militarily something there was pressure not to do. Not to mention the genocide was committed by a non-sovereign state; by militia organisations in Bosnia and was therefore hard to both predict and react to. Serbia never actually invaded Bosnia but merely lent it's forces to Karadzic. If Serbia had openly invaded it would have been a much simpler scenario. No doubt the EU should have been more forceful but to use that against it to say it was unreasonably incompetent is bit harsh. There is a perpetual civil war going on in Mexico right now, people being murdered at random but the US doesn't intervene in it's own backyard because it respects the sovereignty of it's neighbours. Where is that line beyond which Mexico would go where the US would intervene? It's hard to pin down and was no doubt equally hard to pin down for Lord Owen &amp; co who made a decent effort at a peaceful resolution nonetheless.

true,Monagan,null,null,"Technically you commited a crime (Beförderungserschleichung, § 265a StGb), punishable by fine or imprisonment of up to a year. However, since the price for a ticket is usually fairly low, you won't be persecuted unless the affected party (DB in this case) decides to press charges. They instead choose to impose the fine which you are not legally required to pay, although they would be well within their rights to have you stand trial if you refuse (not because you didn't pay their fine but because of the initial crime).  
  
*However*, they most likely won't for one reason: They will usually not press charges for a one-time offense because of how imprecise the law itself is. For you to be convicted it has to be proven beyond a doubt that you were actively trying to deceive them. Because it is fairly difficult to prove this for a one-time offense, the operators of the different German public transport networks won't press charges until you've been caught several times, more or less proving you weren't just being negligent but actually trying to defraud them.  
   
In addition, though this is probably not relevant to the case, since the whole crime is basically a breach of the unwritten contract you enter by stepping on a bus/train, it's not exactly clear if minors could even be charged since, per German law, their ability to enter contracts is limited, so if their parents can believably assure they didn't know about their child taking the bus/train, they're in the clear. The child can still be banned from the trains/buses, though.
  
Also, again not necessarily important (but I figured I'd mention it regardless), if you are caught without a ticket but you *have* a ticket that you merely forgot to bring, you're not required to pay their fine. They will merely require you to show them your ticket at a later time and ask for an administrative fee of about 5-10 Euros.

**TL;DR** Don't worry, you'll be absolutely fine. They probably long forgot about you. Even if, against all odds, they decided to track you down and press charges, they'll never be able to win - *especially* since you can easily use the fact that you're a tourist to claim ignorance (and in this particular case, ignorance *is* an excuse).",0,1367898459,null,0,false,0,c9twe8h,t3_1ds31w,t1_c9twe8h,t1_c9thha7,null,1431277616,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

cerco.

trovo:


&gt; C'è poi la questione indennità. Sono tutti d'accordo sul fatto di dover guadagnare - rimborsi a parte - 2.500 euro al mese. Solo che 5.000 euro lordi vuol dire cose diverse a seconda dei propri redditi e dei carichi familiari. Qualcuno chiede che ci sia una rimodulazione, ma - spiegava un deputato di peso giorni fa - è impossibile: ""Per il fisco noi prendiamo tutta l'indennità, 10mila euro lordi al mese. Alcuni saranno svantaggiati, ma c'è poco da fare. Ecco perché una parte di noi vuole mantenere le indennità accessorie, per compensare quel che perde in tasse"". Che si aggiunge - va ricordato - alla rinuncia all'indennità di fine mandato.

stiam parlando di ""la politica non è un lavoro, la kasta ruba i soldi agli italiani"", son li da due mesi e insomma 2,5k eypo netti iniziano a puzzargli di povertà.

le diarie son bei soldi:

&gt; Si tratta di 3.500 euro di diaria (le spese del mantenimento a Roma, anche per chi ci vive già); 3.690 (4.180 per i senatori) di spese esercizio mandato, quelle che servono per collaboratori (i 5 stelle assumeranno tutti con contratto regolare, e per fare avere 1.500 euro di stipendio a un assistente devono tirarne fuori 2.800); poi 1.000 euro al mese circa, a seconda della distanza casa-aeroporto, per gli spostamenti in taxi (aerei, navi e treni sono rimborsati); infine ci sono 3.098 euro annui di telefono.

Facendo un calcolo spannometrico si tratta di, mensili, 11.288 euro di diarie per un deputato, 11.778 per un senatore, a cui aggiungiamo un netto di 2500 euro di stipendio. 

la frase emblematica mi rimane:

&gt; ""Alcuni saranno svantaggiati, ma c'è poco da fare"" [...] Solo che 5.000 euro lordi vuol dire cose diverse a seconda dei propri redditi e dei carichi familiari

quindi non proprio solo cittadini come tanti, dato che io che sono cittadino come tanti non vedo prendere 5k eypo/mese come uno svantaggio o un passo indietro rispetto la mia retribuzione attuale.

ma comunque, non disperiamo! c'è già una commissione, un think tank, un airganon, una democrazia liquida in corso:

&gt; Ieri pomeriggio avevano votato 132 parlamentari su 163 ***(iniziamo già con gli assenteismi? ndLockdown)***. Il 48 per cento chiede che le diarie (quindi tutte le voci accessorie) vengano mantenute completamente, con l'obbligo di rendicontare tutto quel che si spende, ma senza dovere restituire il di più. Lo farà chi vorrà [...]. Per la rendicontazione pura, per tenersi cioè solo quello che si può provare di aver speso come chiesto da Grillo e Casaleggio, si è espresso il 36 per cento dei parlamentari. Minoritarie le altre ipotesi: il 2,27 vuole trattenere tutto e prendere una decisione definitiva tra 4 mesi, dopo aver visto quanto costa la vita da parlamentare. Altri chiedono che la diaria sia trattenuta solo all'80 per cento, altri ancora volevano stabilire un limite di spesa per macro aree da confermare poi in assemblea. 

Aspettiamo che i guru ci dicano ""prendete tutto, mettiamo tutto nel """"""""fondo di solidarietà del movimento"""""""" a cui abbiamo accesso io e lui"". Vediamo quanti ci cascano.

Questi grillini devo dire di averli sottovalutati; politicamente si dimostrano dei bimbetti scolari, ma ""le manovre bieche dei volponi della politica"" le stanno imparando tutte una via l'altra.

For all else you're looking for I would advise you to look for cities with an university. For cheap accommodation search google (maybe with google translate or something like this) with the term ""Gesellschaft für Wohnungsbau"" and the city you want to live in, usually they offer cheap flats. 

I live in Bremen, it has two universities (well, one is a Fachhochschule/ university for applied sciences, one ""normal"" university and the Jacobs University - privat institution), it's not that far away from Holland, it's rather safe, a lot of people are native english speaker or foreigners since there are some international businesses (Airbus etc). I only have to drive for about 10 minutes with my bicycle until I'm in the countryside (with cows and everything you'd expect). Also, there is a big park (Bürgerpark). There are some animal shelters (but I really don't know if you can work there because in Germany honorary offices are a big thing...usually with no payment). 

You can have a look with google street view, maybe you like it. 

Edit: And as every other rather big city, some of it's parts suffer from gentrification. In Bremen there is the ""Gewoba"" http://www.gewoba.de/startseite/ - they offer cheap flats and for a short time you can rent a flat with furnitures until you find something else. But that's quite expensive, so... they also have informations about the different parts of the city, they are a bit whitewashed but better than nothing I guess. The parts where the more, how can I put this, richer people live are Schwachhausen, Finndorf, some parts of the Neustadt.

The massive increase has been met with appreciation by education unions, who say it is the largest education budget ever allotted in the history of the republic but should be further increased to tackle existing problems in the education system.

The Ministry of Education budget was only TL 11.3 billion in 2002, when the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) first came to power.

true,redem,EURO,European Union,"Almost certainly this misrepresents the legislation, given the source. 

According to a link given by another poster;

&gt; The European Commission today (6 May) unveiled a proposal to simplify European Union regulation of the plant and animal food chain by increasing harmonisation of registration, fines, surveillance and compensation.  

&gt; Tonio Borg, European commissioner for health, said the recent scandal over processed beef tainted with horse meat showed that an upgrade of EU rules is needed. For instance, current rules only ask member states to institute fines for food fraud that are “appropriate and dissuasive”. This vague provision has been interpreted differently by member states, resulting in widely varying fine levels that are sometimes lower than the profit potential for fraud, such as diluting beef with horsemeat which is cheaper.   

&gt;The new rules would specifically require that member states set fines that are equal to the potential economic gain to be made from fraud. “Crime must not pay,” said Borg. “If penalties are low, it does pay.”  

This is the broad point of the legislation.

&gt; The proposal would also introduce a system of mutual recognition for the registration and marketing of plant reproductive material. Registration is currently national, forcing companies to register in each country they want to market their seeds in. Under the proposal, a single authorisation in one member state could be recognised across the EU.

I see much to be worried about after reading various news articles about it. Bureaucratic rules always favor big business over small suppliers.  If a registration of a seed sort is needed before you can sell it, it will destroy variety in the long run. 

The spin of the commission that it is easier if you only have to register in Brussels is ridiculous, given the current state of bureaucratic overkill in the EU institutions.

The main problem with these rules is that the big producer change(d) the seeds over time, that you can't produce your own seeds from then.

Sprache ist jedoch grundsätzlich nicht eindeutig, und damit meine ich nicht nur das generische Maskulinum. Es handelt sich dabei um ein bekanntes Problem, dass alle wissenschaftlichen Fachsprachen stets zu beheben suchen. Der Versuch Sprache zu normieren und diese nicht eindeutigen Formulierungen zu verhindern ist jedoch selten erfolgreich und geschieht im Fall des generischen Maskulinums oft auf Kosten der inhaltlichen Botschaft.

Sprache beruht bekanntermaßen allerdings nicht auf Gesetzen. Ich gehe daher zur Zeit davon aus, dass die weibliche Form sich durchsetzen wird, die grammatikalischen Regeln werden sich über kurz oder lang dem Sprachgebrauch anpassen. 

Ich bin daher keineswegs dagegen die Berufsbezeichnung einer Frau in der eigentlich zur Zeit noch grammatikalisch falschen weiblichen Form zu nennen. Ich würde niemals auf die Idee kommen den Satz ""Meine Gärtnerin macht das immer toll mit den Blumen"" falsch zu verstehen, aber man muss in diesem Fall immer abwägen, wann diese Formulierung eine inhaltliche Abwertung beinhaltet (das ist vor allem bei Vergleichen der Fall): ""Ich hatte noch nie eine bessere Gärtnerin für die Blumen"" (Aber alle männlichen Gärtner waren besser? Im Sinne von... ""naja, nicht schlecht für eine Frau""?). Damit untergräbt man, wenn man nicht genau aufpasst, sehr leicht auch die Errungenschaft der Frauenbewegung der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts, welche sich erst einmal erkämpfen musste mit der männlichen Bezeichnung mitgenannt zu werden (und nicht mit der weiblichen, schlechter Bezahlten Berufsbezeichnung abgewimmelt zu werden).

Zum Thema Doppelnennung vs. Anhängsel: Wenn man eine weibliche Person bei ihrem Beruf nennen möchte und gleichzeitig darauf hinweisen will, so soll man das gerne tun. Die Formulierung ""Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren"" oder auch ""sehr geehrte Mitarbeiter und Mitarbeiterinnen"" sind mittlerweile ja schon fester Bestandteil der deutschen Sprache. Dinge die mir allerdings in meinen eigenen Texten und Briefen zuwider sind, sind Formulierungen mit seltsamen Sonderzeichen oder orthographisch fragwürdige Wörter (Beispielsweise MitarbeiterInnen, Mitarbeiter*innen, Mitarbeiter(innen), Mitarbeiter/-innen). Wenn ich mich dazu entschließe so politisch korrekt zu sein, dass ich zur Bezeichnung der weiblichen Adressaten ein eigenes Wort verwenden sollte, dann schreibe ich dieses Wort wenigstens aus und hänge nicht einfach ein Anhängsel an das bisher universale (jetzt lediglich männlich) Wort.

It seems that it is already required at the national level, the proposal is simply to do this at the EU level in the future. This would reduce the overheads for those selling seeds in multiple EU nations.

&gt;  That's why hobby gardeners are starting to avoid the commercial seeds. They want to be able to regrow the plants on their own.

Gardeners don't need to bother with this anyway, unless your definition of ""Hobby"" is different from mine.

The portuguese government actually pays them to get their kids to school(they receive a minimum wage for each kid, if I'm not mistaken) despite the dropout rate among the community being astonishingly high(they never make it past the age of 12 and the girls' situation is even more astonishing). Education is looked down upon in their community and very, very few actually get a college degree despite that implying being an outcast to the rest of the community, including their own family and other close relatives.

I friend of mine used to teach english to 3rd and 4th graders and it was impossible to do so with more than a gypsy kid in the classroom. They distract the other kids, interrupt the teacher and their parents just storm into the classroom to pick up their kids whenever they want. 
It's a nightmare.

In Lisbon they have a long lasting feud with some african communities that result in a few murders and burned cars every year.

The sad thing is, and the one most americans don't seem to get, these are not punctual cases and these do not happen only in Portugal. r/europe is often seen as a place of antiziganism and defenders of ""fortress europe"" which can't be farther from the truth. 
People do not discriminate gypsies because of their skin tone or the way they talk; it's all about a culture based on thieving, murdering and, overall, chaos.

You never see it there, because restaurants are not allowed to demand money for it, if you ask, you will get some, but it is rather frowned upon to do so, people will think you are avaricious. When i was in the US last year, I was very surprised to almost always find carafes of tap water on the table; it sure is a nice thing to have something to drink from the start.

Second, drinking tap water at home is always a matter of personal preference. Back when I was living at home, my mother always used to serve tap water. Also, we had one of those machines that add gas to the water. But in many of my friends homes they would exclusively drink sparkling water that had been bought in a grocery store.

In the end, it really comes down to preference. Some people seem to think that tap water is ""boring"" or not tasty. But drinking it is definetly a good idea in Germany, especially when you keep in mind, that bottled water often is tap water just sold more expensive.

No it is not. First of all, there are plenty of other factors involved such as interest rates and weird tax rules.  
  
Second of all, if you remove the inflation adjustment you can see that inflation in fact helped the prices not drop so much. For instance, in the last 4 years house prices fell by 6.76%, when adjusted for inflation they fell by 9.14%. So inflation already made a huge difference helping keep the nominal price hence avoiding defaults by homeowners.

true,is_drunk_best_ignore,null,null,"&gt; anyway, my bottom line point, a million light years between Greece and Spain

Agree absolutely. I'm not talking about the financial crisis/credit crunch here, but the underlying systemic weaknesses that it has exposed.

Spain's problem, like Italy's, is that their economies are somewhat uncompetitive, especially compared to Germany's, and their labour markets are fucked thanks to the extreme job protection in place for existing employees. Companies are leery enough hiring new people in an economic slump, and that goes double if it's extremely difficult to get rid of them again.

&gt; The crisis could be quite good for them as they can readjust their costs and look positioned to rival Germany as an exporter in a few years if they sort it out now

Hopefully, but that's going to be difficult while using the euro. At this point, a country would usually devalue their currency to gain competitiveness and kick-start the economy again. They can't do that any more. Devaluing the euro might help, but I don't think Germany would go for it. Merkel simply will not do anything that pisses off German voters.

Germany put itself through painful labour market reforms in 2003/4, when it saw the writing on the wall. Spain etc. will have to do the same to be competitive.

We have a student organization that is largely independent in relation to other student organizations, and we battled our way into the spotlight/attention from the board over the years by picking our own projects. Our independence, has led to us always maintaining our traditional system of accepting new members, which is virtually non-existent. We have a first-year project in which anyone may join, and we learn them stuff and see who sticks around, and we have new members flowing in other more advanced projects if they are more experienced already.

In relation to other student projects which are more controlled and established and more in the spotlight, and are also more critical in their acceptance of new members, we have more female members and also have more international members. (in fact, we mainly speak English in our organization instead of Dutch)

There is less pressure on our members to perform, and we perform nonetheless and on a vastly smaller budget too. Our female members do also occupy the more ""serious"" posts like our own board. We still may not have much female members, but it's relatively more than the percentage of women doing the technical studies relevant to our organization. 

The only existing barrier that seems to exist is in our board, in which we prefer no more than 1 non-Dutch speaking person, seeing that contact to the outside world does often still happen in Dutch. But still, the amount of active international students compared to the other student projects is multiples more, relatively and absolutely speaking.

My lesson from this, is that despite the highly perceived male character of technical studies is that the best way to get actually motivated/interested people who want to learn or want to help others learn as well is by being open and to be wary of any kind of selection.

Our organization and our lack of barriers costs our university virtually nothing, and often only the board can  expect some compensation of some sort. Our time spend on our projects is mainly voluntarily, and all necessary administration/organization work is done because students feel like someone must do it. Students themselves are apparently more than willing to sustain an environment in which much less discrimination/selection bias takes place, and the only thing that they need for that is not to be under time pressure from governmental mandates or mandatory dead-lines in their study.

Anyway, Gypsies are not interesting because they dabble in petty crime, they are interesting because they are a textbook case of failed integration we could learn from. Because let's be honest, Europe is horrible with integration.

You have to look at the big picture, though. Not at what they are, but at why they are what are, and why they keep resisting integration. You can tell yourself that it's just what they are and what they want to be. But do you believe that? Or are they, like everyone, a result of their circumstances? Maybe if you treat people like shit that doesn't even belong on this continent for a couple hundred years it's understandable if at some point they stop giving a fuck about stealing from you? (To exaggerate, of course.)  


Here is what we should do: Enforce school laws so the children actually show up. That's easy. But if the other children in class treat them like shit, see them as nothing but gypsies, how the hell are they supposed to feel like they are part of society? They feel and act like outsiders because they are treated like outsiders. Because too many children are taught by their partens - us - what ""Gypsies"" are, that they should keep a distance. And exactly that is why it is a problem that discrimination against them is still so accepted. That has to change. We have to at least *try* and give their children the benefit of the doubt.

Ministry of Finance (Maliye) is first, Treasury (Hazine Müsteşarlığı) is second. But yes, education comes right after those two in the 2013 budget. It is not as huge a change from before though - the only change is lower military budget. I can't find any budget distributions from before 2000 now, but 2001 budget had the ranking Finance-Treasury-Military-Education. Education has a huge staff load to pay (unlike many other ministries), the high budget (both pre- and post-AKP) doesn't necessarily mean it's being used towards innovation. It could be, but the raw budget percentage is not a very meaningful statistic is what I'm saying.

Let's not put words in my mouth. I do not consider anyone a sub human waste. Their culture, on the other hand, is deplorable.

I've seen some reports of roma who live successful lives outside their culture. They are, however, highly discriminated by other roma people, even by their closest relatives.

Look, I'm not a racist, far from it. I don't even know if you actually understand what the word racism means, which is discrimination based on a person's racial traits, like skin color and whatnot.

We have this rare (perhaps unique) type of mortgages that are indexed so they follow the inflation. This was done in the early 1980s following a period of hyperinflation in Iceland. Most mortgages are also for 40 years and can at most be 80% of the home value. Indexing mortgages means that the value of the mortgage grows over the first half of its period, even if you make all the regular payments and if home prices don't grow as fast as inflation, you might find yourself with a mortgage that has grown larger than the value of your home, a situation that many Icelanders find themselves in after the banking collapse in 2008.",0,1367936875,null,0,false,0,c9u3q6q,t3_1dtmj0,t1_c9u3q6q,t3_1dtmj0,null,1431274090,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

http://www.egitimis.org.tr/(S(jaoseb55max5qtivefvxub45))/haberDetay.aspx?HID=1591

Keep in mind that these are based on the initial suggested amount from the ministry, not the finalized budget the parliament agreed on, so feel free to look only at previous trends and ignore the data points for 2013, while acknowledging that the ministry itself had no intention of almost doubling its percentage from the overall budget.

You realize that this year's extreme burst (in percentage of overall budget) was quite exceptional and the increase has never been that dramatic before, right? That burst was needed for the major change they've planned (4+4+4), which I'm not sure is a move in the positive direction anyway. They're doing *something* to education, they need the money for it, this year's budget increase reflects that. The ""6-fold increase"" is misleading, as the budget itself had a 3-fold increase.

And again, none of this means or guarantees that the change they're investing in is a positive one anyway. I also wish to know how the (necessarily) decreasing percentages of other ministries (particularly health and science&amp;technology as personal interest) are affecting services and investments in those areas and whether the compromise is worth it.

In general, you should do things that are helping integration along anyway. So they *should* already be a priority: 

-Make sure school laws are enforced and the children attend. It's doable, it just requires money and a political will to do so.

-Reduce the influence the level of education/income of the parent has on the success of the child. Much harder, and impossible to eliminate fully. But it absolutely can be reduced. It's a big topic, and especially important in Germany for example. Other countries do better. 

That's what the Government needs to do. And should do anyway, since it's hugely beneficial in general.

As for what we should do: Stop discriminating. It doesn't help integration, it hinders it. Even if you feel you have your just reasons for stereotyping, actually *doing* so just makes things worse. Especially if it is directed at kids. Fake it till you make it.

true,Tabathock,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Look you patronising dickhead. I'm going to spell it out for you. 

In Europe, like most of the rest of the world, we can appreciate cultural differences between nations. I am primarily going to use the differences between Britain and Germany to illustrate the point. I have loads of German friends (which before you make some sly remark about never the sign of clear conscience is totally relevant), like German humour (which is darkly sarcastic), and generally I enjoy spending time with Germans. 

However, I am very critical of the German pacifist attitude. Due to the horrors of WWII pacifism has now become part of the German culture. They refuse to spend money supporting international engagement, their troops peform non-combat roles in war-zones and despite their economic might, refuse to provide active assistance to operations that keep the world safe. They, in my opinion, shared with a shit-tonne of other European nations and the US, are essentially free-loading off US military hegemony and the defence spending of the UK and France. 
Give you a few examples, the Germans are by and large pacifist, the British, French and Danes are more inclined to believe that force is an acceptable solution for diplomatic affairs. A the same time, they see no problem with suppling dodgy regimes with arms, and are in fact the world's 3rd largest arms dealer.

Whether you agree with me or not, you'd have to agree that it is an aspect of German culture, and at the very least there is a debate to be had about it. If there is a debate to be had about it, then you'd have to either agree with the German perspective, or the frustration that Britain, Canada, France, Italy, and the United States express with their ally. 

In business Koreans expect you to get drunk - if you don't they often don't trust you. Alcohol, like in the UK, plays an important cultural part -but in the UK it generally associated with enjoyment rather than as a competitive thing. Many British businessmen I know express contempt for this aspect of Korean culture. They also dislike how Korean firms promote on seniority rather than talent. They, like I, believe that a more meritocratic way is better - not different - better. 

Japanese culture is casually racist. If you are white or black it's not uncommon to be bared from trying on clothes because you smell. If you are white or black you are treated differently. Not good.

In Cambodia, if you are white, you are treated like an upper-caste member of society. Not good and completely at odds with the egalitarianism that I've been brought up believing in. 

On a European level, many continental Europeans believe that the British culture of quasi-isolationism is deeply unpleasant. They believe that it is a truly negative aspect of British culture and therefore open to derision. 

The class system in the UK is a deeply ingrained aspect of culture. You can often predict how people will behave or what clothes they will dress in based on what class they present themselves as. Once again, using the example of the City of London, one of the common complaints is that it is an old boys club. Actually, it is a mixture of Upper-Middle Class people, rough-round-the-edges Essex/Eastenders and foreigners. There is very little in between. It would seem bizarre for outsider and it is commonly criticised as being inferior to other, less class based societies. 

An extreme example of class based culture might be the caste system in India. There is nothing to stop a posh boy marrying a working-class girl in the UK. That kind of relationship would not be allowed in India. 

In the sub-continent, there is a culture that permits arranged marriages. I think that is horrible. Not racism. 

American culture can at times seem bizarre to British people. Putting your hand over your heart or worrying about a meaningless flag being burnt all seem overtly jingositic to the humble brit. 

My point is therefore that you can be critical of a culture (and remember these nations with citizenship lessons, in the case of the United States weird dedication that young kids seem to read every morning). You can be critical of a culture without being racist. If you thought that 'She's the Man' was a better film than the 'Godfather' I wouldn't just think that you had a different attitude, I'd think you were incorrect. In politics, if you were left or right wing, and I was left or right wing, we may get on very well, but we wouldn't assume that the person just held a different opinion, we'd assume each other were either mis-informed or wrong. 

In this particular instance, the culture of gypsies is the problem. It is completely at odds with the culture of every other European nation, and they seek to leech off the more civilised parts of the world whilst maintaining isolation. What is there that gives that any merit? Why should I have to pay lip-service to something that I think is completely ghastly?

 Turkey’s research and development spending up 20 percent 
	09.11.2012
	
	

Dünya - Turkey’s expenditure on research and development (R&amp;D) went up by 20.4 percent in 2011 over the previous year, reaching TRY 11.1 billion (approx. USD 6.2 billion), according to a study by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat). R&amp;D spending as a percentage of GDP reached 0.86 percent from 2010’s 0.84 percent, unveiled in the report entitled “Research and Development Activities Survey”.

The analysis of R&amp;D budgets and personnel data of public institutions, public/private universities and private sector were used to calculate the country’s total amount of R&amp;D spending. The yearly survey put the number of full-time equivalent R&amp;D employees in Turkey at 92,801.

R&amp;D expenditure in Turkey is expected to take up 3 percent of the country’s GDP by 2023, the centennial of the republic.

If you're trying to drive home the point that despising a culture =/= racism, then please don't, I agree. I don't think every culture out there is equal or should be tolerated, and I definitely do not think that the Roma culture should be tolerated.

So I'm not exactly sure what you're spelling out for me.

As it stands right now, the Roma are not being discriminated for their culture, but their race. If the discrimination was based on their culture, then those Roma people who have nothing to do with the culture would not get discriminated against.

true,Taenk,GERM,"For a democratic, European confederation","&gt; I disagree. You can't have a European Union without an actual (effective) political union. If you want this European experiment to work, for the Currency &amp; Monetary Union to hold, you have to integrate and centralize more. You have to actually shape the E.U. into a stable, effective and coherent Nation.

Who is to say that a central EU is the only possible EU? There are many many possibilities to shaping a EU, be it a EU that acts as a unit outwards but is in complete dissent internally, be it a totalitarian, centralized organization, be it a forum for facilitating supranational cooperation. Forcing a monetary or fiscal union to succeed is putting the cart before the horse: The monetary/fiscal union is to be preserved or destroyed if it serves the European peoples.

&gt; By delaying this, by trying to decentralize a already decentralized structure, you are basically throwing sixty-years of hard work down the toilet.

You can work very hard on a very wrong goal. And sunk costs are gone, future expectations are the only relevant measure in decision making.

That being said, we have a very weird mix of centralized and decentralized structures. Personally I find it weird that Austria, a land locked country gets to decide on a common fisheries policy, but space research is somehow better served by the single countries.

&gt; Take the United States for example. Mississippi and California are drowning in debt, but because of the centralized notion of our nation, the other states have no problem with upsurping and helping with that debt. Because that's how country's are supposed to work. It isn't tearing the United States apart like it is the European Union, specifically because how divided and decentralized the European Union is.

Take Mississippi and California for example. Technically these states are in debt with the US treasury which again is backed by the full power of the US. But that is besides the point, ultimately the argument will be that *countries are not companies* and thus should not have the same householding rules as one, e.g. not to take up too much debt. There are two possible rebuttals and I will take the less fundamental one: The US are a monetary and a fiscal union, the EU is only a monetary one. This will tie in to my next paragraph.

&gt; In my opinion, you have two choices, centralize or disband.

And it's not. It is either to implement a fiscal union which necessitates a federal EU or to move away from a monetary union back to national currencies. The EU has worked with multiple national currencies and it will go on to do so.

&gt; But people will be quick to say how different the U.S. is from Europe, how European countries have thousands of years of history and cultural differences. And I say, so what? Do you want to make history, or do you want history to make you?

There are significant differences between the US and the EU. They are two seperate countries after all and we have a plethora of variables to consider. And still the US is a very nice model for the EU to think about what to avoid and what to aspire to.",0,1367943678,null,0,false,0,c9u5xb0,t3_1dv6df,t1_c9u5xb0,t1_c9u5fz7,null,1431273055,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18

Now towards attitudes and politicians: If you are young, healthy and qualified, please come. We are basically at full employment for people with an academic degree. Problem is of course the language, but people with degrees tend to know at least some English and that's a language of increasing importance for qualified positions anyway (That does not work all the time though, so no problem with ""the foreigners stealing all our jobs""). Also, you pay your taxes here. We like that. There is the brain-drain in other countries though, but that seems to be another discussion.

Like any liberty, this one has abuse cases, and like always, a society that wants said liberty has to cope with the abuse cases. What you would think of is all the unemployed (or just the umemployable) from $country moving to Germany. I think people would consider that abuse. Here is what I think of it: First, it's unlikely. You need some social mobility for this kind of stunt, and long-time unemployed tend to lose that a bit (yes, very scientific thought there). Second, yes, you get welfare. You can live of that (that's the idea). But the basic unemployment subsidies (aka ""Hartz IV"") are extremely low, and it's not fun to live in that. This is a result of the Agenda 2010 reforms. Friends of mine went through that, and it was heartbreaking. If you *want* to work, but there *is* no work, Hartz IV really sucks. Money is extremely tight (if you don't work off the books). Also, you have to take almost any job offer (or they cut your support), and they can make you do ""1 Euro Jobs"" (or they cut your support). That means e.g., cleaning the sidewalk for a Euro an hour (yes, they can force you to do that. Idea is that since you are now ""employed"" by the government, you might as well work for them. Since it's not really a demeaning job, albeit prolly not a fun one, I think that's okay). Fun times. Yes, there are, as always, people who seem to live comfortably off Hartz IV and have no intention of working, but as I said: There is always going to be abuse.

How would Germany cope with mass immigration? I remember conservative politicians say that ""Germany is not an immigration country"", back in the 90ies. That was funny. Germany has always been an immigration country, dating back at least as far as the Huguenot wars. There is those coming to Prussia, there is Austria-Hungary internal migration, there is the Polish in the Ruhr area, the Italians coming in the 60ies and 70ies, the Turkish, the Polish again after the fall of the Iron curtain, the ""Spätaussiedler"" coming from Russia and Kazakhstan, the Romanians, ...

true,banana-tree,TURK,Turkey,"&gt;At least now you admit the percentage increase

This is not a constant trend (the increase in percentage of budget), there has always been absolute increase not just in education but in most ministry budgets, because overall budget increased. This year's increase is an exception, not reflective of AKP's constant commitment to education throughout their rule. Your initial point, education taking the biggest slice, was both technically inaccurate, and not reflective of any positive reforms in an of itself. And you didn't even address the last link I gave, which pointed out that the percentage of expenditure on reform within the education budget and spending on higher education has been on a consistent decrease throughout AKP's rule with the exception of this last year's budget.

&gt; ""the only change is lower military budget."" which is not true.

It's not my problem if you're unable to infer from context that I'm talking about relative percentage in the budget.

&gt; ""Speaking at a press conference in the Turkish capital of Ankara on Tuesday, Simsek said that education and health were the two top sectors in the budget for 2013.""

Yea, I don't see any numbers there. I got my numbers from [here](http://finans.milliyet.com.tr/portal/ISE/getDetailsStory.html?storyId=134381&amp;goToHomePageParam=true&amp;siteLanguage=en)

""2013 yılında Sağlık Bakanlığı'nın bütçe ödeneği 2012 yılına göre yüzde 82.7 azalışla 2 milyar 490 milyon TL olarak öngörülürken...""

And here's minister Akdağ confirming the number for the ministry (which is different from the total healthcare expenditure);

http://ekonomi.milliyet.com.tr/2013-te-sagliga-16-8-milyar-tl-ayrildi/ekonomi/ekonomidetay/20.11.2012/1629963/default.htm

&gt; The analysis of R&amp;D budgets and personnel data of public institutions, public/**private universities** and **private sector** were used to calculate the country’s total amount of R&amp;D spending.

The EU has existed in its various forms for a long time, the Euro only launched in 2000. It's a bit of a stretch to say the former relies on the latter.

&gt; This whole process is ass-backwards. A federal Europe should've came before a Currency &amp; Monetary Union.

Yes, but the reason it's happened this way is that most people aren't all that keen on a lot of their country's legislative power moving to Brussels, and they're especially not keen on any sort of fiscal guarantees or continuous fiscal transfers across borders. If Krugman's right about the need for fiscal transfers to stabilize EMU, then I'd say we're in some trouble.

Maybe now, yes.  Anyway, the 'watch' I have in mind mainly entails local, democratic control.  We just can't keep going 'rah rah we're the best, the giant is waking up, blah blah' as the country's foreign policy gets assertive overtly and covertly.  Even the best minds and mildest personalities will be corrupted w/o a healthy, free atmosphere and local dissent/opposition.

&gt;The power the AKP wields has more to do with the fact that the Kemalists have seen their power base dwindeling for some years, Why? Probably because a majority outside the cities aren't secular but rahter conservative muslims.

The 'Kemalism' characterization is way too broad, IMHO but a lot of people including Europeans pushed a line that went like ""Kemalists vs. _the people_"" for such a long time that it has become ""_the truth_.""  AKP is a center right party that implicitly stresses Islam.  Previously, DP/Menderes, AP/Demirel managed to get over 50% when they were the sole viable party in the 'right.'   So the phenomenon isn't necessarily new.  Beyond that, it is hard to tell what exactly is going on because information just doesn't flow the way you'd expect in an ""advanced democracy"" (this is what AKP calls our present regime, thus the scare quotes).

&gt; There is nothing we in the west can do about that though, that is up to the turks. 

There is Western involvement in this.  When Turkey shut down RP, ECHR blessed the decision, for example.  When the same was attempted on the AKP, the EU screamed bloody murder.  Now neither attempt is necessarily good (I disagreed with both) but the implication isn't lost on the politically-engaged people here.  You are probably right about the US support, though it is hard to figure out just what shape it takes.  (A zillion conspiracy theories exist, of course.)

The ""Lied der Deutschen"" (song of the Germans (literally Teutons, which is what we call ourself)) has been use from 1922-1945 (after 1933 the Horst-Wessel-Lied was more popular and only the first strophe of the Lied der Deutschen was sung). It has been the official hymne again since 1952. Only the third strophe was being used, though all three strophes were officially part, since 1991 only the third is official. 

The melodie dates back to 1797 (Franz Joseph Haydn) and was first used for the emperor of the HRE, Franz II., the text is from 1841 by August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben.

The DDR (east Germany) had it's own hymne called ""Auferstanden aus Ruinen"" (risen from ruins). Funny thing is, you could sing both anthems at once and their different melodies would match. This, however, was not done on purpose because of some romantic mind, but plagiarism.

Dunno about Bulgaria. The ""waves of impoverished"", I am not sure of. May be just fishing for sentiments on the right, although Friedrich seems not to be a guy doing that. 
I remember, when Poland joined the EU and Schengen and whatnot, there was real fear of the ""hordes of Polish streaming on the job market"" and so on. So there was this seven year ""grace period"", where restrictions applied to Polish' freedom of movement. Turned out, all the Polish that wanted to come to Germany where already here and most of those still in Poland actually liked it there better anyway. Duh. 
There is always some diffuse fear of mass immigration from economically poorer areas. It's more pronounced among those with little or no formal training, *because these are directly competing with immigrants* that may not have their skills recognized and, hence, do unskilled labor, but work harder than the Germans. I don't quite know how the reaction would be in the face of mass immigration of people that just use the social safety net. As an abstract concept, any EU citizen has certain rights and if she/he exercises those rights here, well, we gotta help them. On the other hand, not sure what I would feel when I directly see my taxes go up by 20% because we now have another 2 million foreign unemployed to feed. I believe that I personally could see through this, but not everyone will. People with less education and faith in EU integration might not.

Regarding minimum wage, it's hard to say. Personally I find the idea that a full-time job should pay enough to feed a person quite convincing. What we have now is a lot of jobs that don't do that (e.g., hair cutters in certain parts of eastern Germany are rumored to be paid as low as €3/hour). So what happens is that the government pays them the difference between what they earn and what everybody is entitled to (the so called ""Existenzminimum""). People that get such assistance are called ""Aufstocker"". The problem with this is that these people might as well not work, because they get the same amount when unemployed. Google ""Lohnabstandsgebot"" for more. So it's basically companies outsourcing some of their payrolls to the public. 
On the other hand, opponents of a minimum wage say that such a minimum wage might make some jobs unsustainable: If you don't earn your employer more than you get paid (plus taxes, profit), he might as well not employ you. We have several million people in such ""precarious"" employment situations, so those might flood back into unemployment, opponents of a minimum wage say.
I think there is some truth to that. However, we do have a minimum wage in several areas prone to wage dumping already, e.g., construction (regulations there are really tight. And for a reason).  Google ""Entsendegesetz"". Also, let's say we introduce a minimum wage to office cleaning companies, a field notorious for low wages. Will people stop having their offices cleaned? Probably not. So (my personal theory is that) wages there might rise, companies pay more for cleaning and that's it. 

I don't know enough about economics to say what's better. As a left-leaning person, I support minimum wage though. :-)",0,1367948805,null,0,false,0,c9u7qpw,t3_1dux0h,t1_c9u7qpw,t1_c9u6lmj,null,1431272198,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9
