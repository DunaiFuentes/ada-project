I'm curious about the method used to compare what the two ports will do in the future.

The argument is simple. Greece didn't have money to upgrade the port. It *leased* part of the port to a party that could guarantee increased throughput. The increased throughput benefits the state and its citizens, directly and indirectly.

Let me remind you some information about the deal.

http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2010-07/13/content_10099685.htm

&gt; Despite financial turmoil surrounding Greece, COSCO Pacific, a port operator subsidiary of China's State-owned shipping giant China Ocean Shipping (Group) Co (COSCO), has signed a $4.2 billion deal to take over management of an Athens container port.

&gt; COSCO signed a 35-year lease in June and will spend $707 million to upgrade port facilities, build a new pier and almost *triple* the volume of cargo the port can handle.

&gt; The move is part of an effort to create a network of ports, logistics centers and railways to distribute Chinese products across Europe - in essence a modern Silk Road - hastening the speed of East West trade and creating a valuable economic foothold on the continent.

&gt; The Piraeus port in Athens can currently load and unload 1.8 million containers a year.

&gt; With a strategic position near the Straits of Bosphorus, the port also provides a way into the Black Sea region, central Asia and Russia.

Pay attention to this.

&gt; **COSCO aims to make the container port a hub to rival Rotterdam - Europe's largest port.**


Also, we're not talking about an isolated case here.

http://worldcrunch.com/business-finance/can-a-chinese-shipping-conglomerate-save-greece-039-s-biggest-port-/piraeus-athens-port-harbor-cosco-china-fret-cargo-crisis-chinese-economy-suez-canal-mediterranean-sea-strikes/c2s10544/ (translation from Le Monde's article)

&gt; Cosco is present in many European ports, from Antwerp (Belgium) to Naples (Italy) – where Captain Fu was working before coming to Piraeus – as well as Hamburg (Germany) or even Fos-sur-Mer (France). Piraeus is the main entry port into Southern and Eastern Europe, to the Black Sea and Russia.

As more customers will transport their goods via Piraeus, profits from the deal with Cosco will be used to upgrade OLP's Pier 1.

Und mit den Bananen und Äpfeln sprichst du eine weitere Schwachstelle der Idee der besteuerung von Luxusgütern an. Wie bestimmt man ein Luxusgut?

Ist bei Obst genauso. Das eine Grundversorgung an Obst bestehen muss ist klar. Reichen da (heimische) Äpfel? Sind Bananen Luxus? Und was ist mit Lichees?

Aber das Reh an sich, die Wildschweine sowiso, gedeihen in der modernen Kulturlandschaft mit ihrer Mischung aus Waldstücken, Feldern und Waldrändern ja doch ziemlich prächtig - dewegen können ja so viele erlegt werden. Naturschutz ist für die damit relativ irrelevant. Bei Feldhasen braucht es jetzt auch keine Jagdmaßnahmen, eher Landwirte die Bei der Bewirtschaftung ihrer Felder Rücksicht nehmen. Singvögel sind eh von der Jagd ausgenommen soweit ich weis, das hilft natürlich. Und seltene Trockenrasen profitieren von ordentlichen Bebauungsplänen eher als von Jägern.

Und ein Fichtenwald oder ein Maisfeld sind jetzt nicht wirklich bessere Habitate, wenn am Rand ein Jägersitz steht. Nationalparks und Jagd stehen auch eher nebeneinander. Jäger sind jetzt auch nicht die großen Verfechter von Kläranlagen gegen Eutrophierung gewesen. Füchs zur Strecke bringen stoppt nicht die Zersiedelung der Landschaft, die Versiegelung von Bodenflächen, Quartierverluste von Fledermäusen durch die Sanierung von Altbauten, Erhöhten Stickstoffeintrag durch den Straßenverkehr, Einschleppung invasiver Muschelarten, Klimaeffekte, solche Sachen.

Wenn, hatte dich eh das Reh das schönere Leben. Aber der Diskurs in Deutschland erreicht immer so ein schwieriges Niveau bei der Jagddiskussion, sobald die Biologie mit einbezogen wird. Nicht nur von Jägern, auch bei Jagdgegnern.

Biologie sollte man auf die Rolle der Bereitstellung von Managementmethoden, Folgenabschätzung und so weiter reduzieren. Als praktische und planerische Hilfe, sozusagen. Da kann der Biologie liefern. Aber das für und wider der Jagd, das soll mir lieber woanders entschieden werden. Und die Jäger haben sicher gute wirtschaftliche Argumente, die müssen sich nicht verstecken.

The easiest countries to start off with would be Castille, England, France, Austria or Burgundy though you can really just choose whatever . Reason all the before mentioned are European though is because [Westernisation](http://www.paradoxian.org/eu3wiki/Westernise) is a bitch.

true,TheRayKillerNL,null,null,"Einleitung 
ich möchte euch etwas erzählen über meine Profilarbeit. Ich habe meine Profilarbeit über Apple getan, weil ich mich interessiere für die Wirtschaft und Apple ist ein großer betrieb.
Geschichte Ich fange an mit der Geschichte. Das Unternehmen wurde am 3. Januar 1977 von Steve Jobs und Steve Wozniak gegründet. Das Unternehmen fang an in Steve Jobs‘ Garage. Steve Jobs und Steve Wozniak haben viel experimentiert und damit erstand der Apple I. Der Computer war nicht sehr beliebt und das Unternehmen wahr nicht sehr erfolgreich, aber das änderte sich mit der Einführung der Apple II Computer. Der Apple II war erfolgreich und auch der Erste Persönliche Computer in der Welt. Nach der Apple II hat Apple viele Versionen ausgebracht, aber keine Version war sehr erfolgreich. In 1984 hat Apple die Macintosh auf dem Markt gebracht, und das war ein Erfolg. Die Macintosh war sehr originell, aber für manche Leute zu revolutionär. Danach hat Apple ziemlich gute Resultate aber das war nicht mehr so in den Neunziger Jahre. Es gab sehr viel Wettbewerb und darum hat Apple einen kleinen Marktanteil und Apple verkaufte auch nicht viele Produkte. In 1997 war Apple fast Bankrott gegangen, aber Apple war gerettet durch eine Investierung. Danach hat sehr viel sich geändert und Apple hat ein großes Comeback gemacht. Der Erste Mac Computer war eingeführt und Apple ging sehr viele Aufmerksamkeit an das Design geben. Apple bekam auch sehr populär in dieser Zeit. In 2001 kam ein tragbares Musikabspielgerät, der iPod. Der iPod war sehr erfolgreich und in den folgenden Jahren gab es viele Versionen. Es gab der iPod Touch, Classic, Nano, Shuffle, und Mini. In den Vereinigten Staaten hat Apple einen Marktanteil von mehr als 90 Prozent. Apple hat nach dem iPod auch noch das iPad und das iPhone auf dem Markt gebracht.

Produkte 

iPod 
Der iPod war der erste Erfolg von Apple. Es ist ein tragbares, digitales, Musikabspielgerät und der iPod war sehr charakteristisch für Apple. Es hat eine schönem, einfache Formgebung und war sehr benutzerfreundlich. Der iPod war sehr revolutionär und es war nicht wie die andere Musikabspielgeräten. Ich habe schon gesagt das es viele Versionen gibt, aber es gibt auch viele Ausgabe des iPods. Diese Ausgabe heißen Generationen. Jede Generation hat andere Funktionen und eine andere Formgebung. Mit dieser Generationen verkauft Apple mehr und es erneuert die Produkte.

iPhone
 Das iPhone ist eine Smartphone von Apple und es ist sehr erfolgreich. Das iPhone war das erste Handy mit einer “on-touch” Tastatur. Das Handy ist vergleichbar mit dem iPod Touch, aber es hat mehr Funktionen als den iPod Touch. Das iPhone war gleich sehr populär durch die Formgebung und die Benutzerfreundlichkeit. Das iPhone hat fünf verschiedene Generationen und das sind noch nicht alle Generationen. Es hat also seines eigenes Betriebssystem, IOS. IOS wird auch für das iPad und den iPod Touch benutzt.

iPad 

Das iPad ist ein Tablet-Computer und war in 2010 herausgebracht. Es ist auch sehr modern und einfach. Die Idee war schon sehr Alt, aber der Tablet-Computer war nicht populär. Das änderte sich mit der Introduktion von dem iPad. Das iPad ist sehr erfolgreich durch den großen Schirm und leichtes Gewicht. Man kann es sehr einfach mitbringen und darum wird es oft gebraucht für sachliche Zwecken. In diesem Moment gibt es vier verschiedene Generationen für das iPad. Aber es gibt auch noch eine andere Version. Diese Version heißt der iPad mini und das ist eine kleinere Version.

Marketing

Apple macht nicht viel Werbung aber Apple ist doch sehr erfolgreich. Der Grund warum Apple nicht so viel Werbung macht, ist weil das Produkt sich selbst verkauft. Bevor Apple erfolgreich war, brauchten sie viel Werbung, aber das brauchen sie jetzt nicht mehr. Die Leute sind sehr positiv über Apple und sie sagen das gegen einander. Diese Werbung heißt Mundpropaganda. Das ist für Apple sehr lukrativ weil es nichts kostet. Dadurch gebt Apple nicht so viel aus wie andere Betrieben für Werbung. Aber wenn sie doch Werbung machen, ist die Nachricht sehr einfach und kurz. Apple tut das, weil sie glauben dass die Leute die Werbung erinnern und die Leute darüber nachdenken gehen. Der Slogan für den iPod war: 1000 Songs in der Tasche. Der Slogan ist sehr einfach und die Leute verstanden was Apple damit meint, darum ist der Slogan sehr kräftig. Apple benutzt die Nachrichten auch für die Werbung. Apple hat viele Rechtssachen mit Samsung und das ist auch Werbung. Die Rechtssachen gehen über Urheberrechtschändung und es ist oft in den Nachrichten.

Zukunft 

Seitdem Steve Jobs Apple wegen Gesundheitsproblemen verlassen hat, hat sich viel geändert. Apple ist beschäftigt mit der Produktion neuer Produkte und der neue CEO, Tim Cook, will nicht, dass die Geheimnisse durchsickern. Apple interessiert sich sehr für Apple TV und die iWatch. Apple versucht kreativ und originell zu sein und darum experimentieren sie mit neuen Produkte. Apple will die Konkurrenz schlagen und erfolgreich bleiben. Für die iWatch zum Beispiel gibt es großes mediales Interesse. Es gibt Gerüchte dass die iWatch gegen Ende des Jahres herausgebracht wird aber das ist noch nicht sicher.",0,1363120706,null,0,1363121201,0,c8ueypf,t3_1a5icv,t1_c8ueypf,t3_1a5icv,null,1431564230,1,false,GermanPractice,t5_2t7fs,1

You're getting angry at people for generalising about you and your ""background"" and in tern making judgments about all left wingers.

There's a huge amount of idiots on both sides of any political debate or allegiance or what have you. There's stupid leftists, stupid right wingers, stupid centrists, stupid Europhiles and stupid eurosceptics. The list could go on for eternity. However, those stupid people seldom define the group (perhaps, maybe, like one or two exceptions ^((BNP)^) ). Whilst one side of a political, racial, economic, ect thing might be particularly good at having a certain kind of prejudice under its mitts, that doesn't define the group. I understand that's not what you're saying, but what you are saying really does seem to be a gross over generalisation.

Yes, the left and the right wings are racist. Racism has little to do with the political spectrum. Otherwise we'd call it the prejudice spectrum. There's little point trying yo determine which side is more racist than the other. Doing so is about as beneficial as arguing over whether whites wast more money than blacks or what ever. It's pointless, achieves nothing of any benefit and creates a 'them and us' mentality which pets lefties against righties and blacks against whites or Catholics against Protestants.

However, you have 90 days in the Schengen Zone, as a whole, not in every country, so you could run into some problems with your plan (unless you have dual citizenship, then disregard!) In the past you could hop over to a non-Schengen country, like Morocco, and get your passport stamped and be good for another 3 months, but they've caught on to this. Now you have to be out for a full 90 days before you can re-enter. 

Technically, you're supposed to be able to go to and from any other Schengen country without going through passport control, but in the last 6 months I was checked in countries that previously I had never had problems with-like Italy. 

Be careful overstaying that tourist visa, you can get a fine and/or a 5 year ban. Switzerland, Germany, and the UK are especially strict and through about checking.

The growth of Europe would come either way because of how utterly destroyed everything was, it would be very hard to sink even lower than 1945. The Marshall Plan certainly did wonders in helping with the recovery though it's easy to understand why, the USA was basically spending a lot of money on rebuilding Europe, a lot was rebuilt at the expense of the USA and that's why it was so good for us.

As for the growth of the USA, it wasn't growth because of the Marshall plan but rather growth despite the Marshall plan, had they not spent a dime on Europe after the war (well, ignoring the consequences that would have on us and later on them as well because of how interconnected our economies are), their growth would have been even greater, they did spent billions here on us. Nevertheless, they also had a very strong growth as they were the only superpower left that wasn't devastated by the war (unlike the UK, Germany, the USSR, Japan and the like). They were the pretty much the only producer while the rest of the world was their consumer.

This is fine, but hardly unique to American democracy. This is what makes federalism federalism.

**2) A legislature with an Lower Chamber resembling the U.S. House of Representatives that would recognize the increased influence of the more-populated states (I.E. The EU3/Calfiornia, New York) through representation by population, but also possessing an Upper House like the U.S. Senate which would preserve the influence of the less-populated states by (I.E. Alaska, Sweden) restricting each Member State to a equal, set number of Representatives.**

The Senate is the most undemocratic thing about American democracy. Most EU countries have weak upper houses, especially relative to the United States Senate. It would not fit European political culture. Something like an elected Bundesrat would be more appropriate, having something in between proportional representation and equal representation. It already exists in some EU institutions through weighted voting.

**3) An electoral system that balances the will of both the general population and states through a system like the Electoral College, so as to, once again, avoid the executive branch from being dominated by the EU3 or more-populated American States.**

The electoral college is the second most undemocratic thing about American government. It also doesn't fit European political culture, since most EU states have a parliamentary form of government. A directly elected President of the EU may not be the best idea in a federal Europe.

**4) A united, competent and coherent military that can be used effectively for national defense, while also affording the Member States the authority to raise State Defense Forces (to lazy, wiki it) under the sole authority of each State's Executive and Reserve Troops (National Guard) under the nominal command of each State's Executive (but Reserve Troops can be federalized at any time by the E.U./U.S. President)**

Again, this is also not unique to American government. A centralization of European government seems to imply a centralization of defense policy as well.

Keep in mind that when the United States of Europe is thrown around as an idea, it is really only used as a simple analogy in which there is a strong central government with many states. The term doesn't imply that Europe should emulate American government. It's just easy to use since the US is the federal system most Europeans are most familiar with.

If and when a federal Europe comes about, it will be its own entity, based on its own ideas, as well as ideas from other countries across the world and throughout history.

&gt; maybe until they lower their wages so much they can make something for chinese children. 
   
   I don't even...

&gt;This whole euro should never of existed in the first place.

  If the UK's brave attempts at showing us how much better having a smaller currency area are of any indication, a level of economic integration has been reached that mutual dependence and shared context prevents the benefits of competitive devaluation from outweighing the stability of monetary integration. Considering that the US is being seen as improving  and it is a large monetary area, i don't see how you might be correct, unless you advocate that states in the US should have their own currency, which i would find interesting.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;While what the majority of the Founding Fathers proposed was inspired by European thinkers and intellectuals, the federal-style of our government and the imposing debate of State Rights is a theme, while not created by the United States, one which it has some of the strongest influence on, and probably why thirteen break-away colonies were treated more than just that after their independence.

Yea. All I'm saying is that the state's having certain powers and rights are not unique to American democracy. This has been an aspect of European governance since the 1950s, and will continue to be as long as the EU exists.

&gt;Being from Scotland, can you not see the benefits of set, equal representation between all Member States, so as to not be dominated politically and legislatively by larger, more populated states such as those in the EU3?

I'm actually not the above poster, but I took the liberty of responding to your question. I'm American myself, from California actually, so I'm quite biased in my opinion on the Senate. I understand why its beneficial for the smaller states, but it's still fundamentally undemocratic and makes governance far more difficult. I wouldn't have as much of a problem with it if the Senate was much weaker than it is.

&gt;This is something I disagree with, but can understand

How is it not though? The Senate is the most, given that it provides equal representation for the states. The electoral college disenfranchises voters in the populous states. A vote from California or Texas has far less weight than one from Wyoming. The electoral college also makes certain states more valuable than others (Ohio, Florida) in the election. It's hardly fair for presidential candidates to focus so much on the issues of these few electorates when the office they seek is responsible to govern a union of 50 states.

&gt;But this I can't. The European Union and the Euro happened, this is just as unlikely as they were. European political culture will be constantly changing, that's the point of democracy.

My point was that most EU states have prime ministers, who are indirect representatives of their country. I wouldn't be opposed to a directly elected President of the EU. All I'm suggesting is that Europeans already have a clear preference for executive power, and that is prime ministerial.",0,1363132691,null,0,false,0,c8uj8pd,t3_1a6go5,t1_c8uj8pd,t1_c8uj0gn,null,1431566208,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Due to various historical events combined with the clout of the Anglospheres trading in the modern world, English has become essential to stay ahead.


I also don't think people should give up their languages. The Welsh still have Welsh spoken, both Irish and Scotch Gaelic is around. However we all have a common language for law and business. Which is what the EU needs. I definitely don't want to see languages die out, but we need a common language to bond us together. Many people can already speak 2 languages, one of which is usually English, so it makes sense to keep all legal and business information in a language 'everyone' can understand.

&gt; 1. Cet accord intervient dans le cadre de la feuille de route gouvernementale ayant fait suite à la conférence sociale organisée peu de temps après l’élection du président socialiste François Hollande. Pourtant, le contenu de cet accord se situe dans une continuité remarquable avec les réformes sociales menées durant les dix années de gouvernement de droite (2002-2012). Ainsi, malgré le rejet populaire de Sarkozy qui a permis la victoire de Hollande, sa politique se prolongerait. Tel sera le cas si l’accord fait l’objet d’une transposition fidèle dans la loi et la réglementation comme l’ont annoncé sans aucune ambiguïté tant le Président de la République que son Premier ministre au nom d’une certaine conception de la « démocratie sociale ».

&gt; 2. Même si l’application du droit du travail reste souvent virtuelle dans le contexte de chômage massif actuel, il entend faire céder les digues juridiques restantes. Il s’agit ainsi en particulier d’assouplir radicalement le régime juridique du CDI, de parachever l’inversion de la hiérarchie des normes, de se débarrasser de la notion de durée légale du temps de travail, de limiter drastiquement les possibilités de recours et de défense des salariés, d’en finir avec le statut de la fonction publique. Sur plusieurs de ces objectifs, l’accord national interprofessionnel qui vient d’être signé lui donne satisfaction sur des points de grande portée. 

&gt; 3. .../...les accords de maintien de l’emploi. Il s’agit à strictement parler de la mesure promue sous le nom d’accord de compétitivité-emploi par Nicolas Sarkozy au cours de sa campagne présidentielle, et combattue alors par le Parti Socialiste. Un employeur pourra « en cas de nécessité de sauvegarder la compétitivité de l’entreprise » négocier un accord à durée limitée prévoyant sur cette durée une baisse de rémunération, ou de jours de congés, en échange d’un maintien de l’emploi. 

&gt; 4. la grande innovation consiste dans le fait de permettre le licenciement automatique pour motif économique de tout salarié qui refuserait une modification de son contrat de travail qui résulterait de l’accord ainsi signé. Formellement, le salarié peut certes toujours refuser, mais sous peine d’être viré. On conviendra qu’il s’agit d’une curieuse manière de garantir la prééminence des clauses du contrat de travail plus favorables que celles d’un accord collectif.

Sinon il faut descendre dans la deuxième moitie du texte pour trouver cette énumération :

&gt;  Plusieurs revendications patronales majeures ont été satisfaites par cet accord .../... l’accord organise en réalité une réduction des droits individuels et collectifs des salariés: 

&gt; \- Affaiblir le cadre du contrat à durée indéterminée : nouvelle tentative de développer le contrat de travail intermittent ; affaiblissement des garanties contractuelles sur la mobilité

&gt; \- Développer les possibilités de dérogation de gré à gré entre employeur et salarié comme si les deux parties étaient dans une situation d’égalité (clauses d’opt out des anglo-saxons) : avenant temporaire au contrat de travail d’augmentation de la durée du travail et accord pour réduire la durée minimale du temps de travail dans le régime du temps partiel

&gt; \- Faciliter les procédures de licenciement collectif : raccourcissement de la durée de la procédure ; restriction des délais de contestation des procédures ; possibilité de déroger par accord à la législation ; procédure d’homologation administrative

&gt; \- Inverser la hiérarchie historique des normes en droit du travail et supprimer le principe de faveur : remise en cause de la primauté de la clause du contrat de travail plus favorable sur celle de l’accord collectif moins favorable

&gt; \- Limiter les droits collectifs de défense des salariés : limitation du droit à l’expertise et restriction de certains délais de saisine du juge par le CE

&gt; \- Limiter les droits individuels de défense des salariés : raccourcissement des délais de prescription pour saisir le conseil des prud’hommes d’une contestation salariale ou relative à la rupture du contrat de travail

Europeans can't relocate to another state because the language would be different; there's no way for an Italian to relocate to Poland, a German to Bulgaria, etc. 

This is something you can see right now: Portuguese affected by the crisis are relocating *en masse* to Angola, a country they actually have ties with.
There are currently more Portuguese in Angola than Angolans in Portugal.

[As you can see on this website](http://www.facebookstories.com/stories/1574/interactive-mapping-the-world-s-friendships#color=continent&amp;story=1&amp;country=GB), the people of Europe predominantly have ties with countries outside of the EU. Brits feel close to Ireland, Nigeria and South Africa, Spain close to countries in South America, France close to North Africa, etc. This European ""friendship"" is a myth.

Regarding State Rights, the EU is already federated: [the European Commission is the only entity  and the only one allowed to set policy on all big questions](http://euwiki.org/TFEU#Article_3) like customs, competition rules for the internal market, monetary policy, fisheries; states do not have a say in the matter.

Pretty much every EU member state is also a member of NATO, so yeah... and why should a country be subject to a parliament acting against the interests of said country, no matter how it's organized ?

Consider the following:

In July 2011, the European Parliament had to vote on a [proposition](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A7-2011-0195&amp;language=EN) coming from the European Commission, regarding the use of animal protein to feed fishes with.

[French MEPs voted massively against it](http://www.votewatch.eu/en/legislation-on-transmissible-spongiform-encephalopathies-tse-and-on-related-feed-and-food-controls-m-2.html#/##vote-tabs-list-4) (86% or even 95%). 

However, what you have to know is that, at the European level, **72% of MEPs  voted in favor,** in particular from Germany, the Netherlands, Czech Republic and a majority of Eastern European states.

If France was not part of the EU, there would be no meat and bone meals at all, since French representatives would have voted against it at the French Parliament. 

So if the French have meals fed by animal proteins, starting from June 1st 2013,  this is only because a majority of European deputies representing other countries  imposed their decision.

This is why the arguments for other forms of administration in this thread are pointless: at the end, when there diverging points of view, some interests are going to be trampled, no matter who decides.

France should not impose her point of view*(read: democratic will of the people/national interests/pressure from lobbies)* upon other countries and vice versa.

How are those students going to learn proper German if everybody would speak with them like they're idiots?

Also, we had a bit of a situation yesterday. We've got to take 2 out of 3 mathematical classes. Calculus 2, statistics, linear algebra 2. The student from Ghana wasn't sure what to take and since statistics might be more reading than calculus 2 (problems in text form), we made him aware of the situation and he gladly accepted out concerns. 

There is a time and a place for concerns because of immigration backgrounds and just talking to people in a non professional context if not one of them. 

To the people that can't speak German: if you want to sound clever, you express yourself as complicated as possible in German so the text based mathematical problems can be a proper concern for people that are not entirely fluent in German (even I have to read stuff twice sometimes and most professors recommend English books over German books for stuff like electronics because it's just easier).

Please remember that USA is a poor example of federation (as is Russia). Not only for the reasons earlier mentioned in the thread, but because the balance of power has changed strongly since the original implementation. When people in EU talk of federalism, they speak of federation as USA was before your Civil War. You know, not ""the United States"" but ""these United States"". The civil war was a huge power grap for POTUS from governors and congress. 

A second point is that the political system you have is archaic. When USA was created, Europe still had absolute monarchies and the biggest threat for stability was Turkey, which bordered Austria and had for centuries tried to get to Germanies. Time and values has marched on.

The system you came up with was rather good.. for the time. But now it's mostly seen as a living fossil. People would rebel if your system was ever implemented here.

In questo modo oltretutto la realtà pensionistica sarebbe il riflesso di quella lavorativa che l'ha preceduta: la generazione x si è comportata bene? La generazione x avrà belle pensioni. Oppure il contrario. E così si eviterebbe una situazione come la corrente, dove i giovani stanno pagando per le mancanze dei loro genitori.

He seems to me like a really fascinating person, extremely thoughtful, but also determined to live a principled life. Made me wonder if he read Kant.

Perhaps he's actually a better representative of the 20 July plot than Stauffenberg, who is usually the guy that everybody's swooning over. There's a part in the interview where von Kleist mentions how he never quite liked the fact that many of his co-conspirators where too ""emotional"" and ""naive"" about the plot (I'm paraphrasing a bit now), and how they underestimated how difficult it would be get rid of the dictatorial structures imposed by the NSDAP. It doesn't diminish the moral accomplishment of the other conspirators that they were perhaps less calculating and rational than von Kleist, but personally, I can relate to him much better than to someone who appears to stand more in the tradition of German romanticism, like for example Stauffenberg.

Throughout the interview I got the impression that von Kleist was a rather intelligent young man, but when he had to decide how to act (participate in the 20 July coup, or not), he wasn't held back by any kind of intellectual indeterminism. He mentions he asked his father for advice, who recommend to take part, because ""someone who fails to do so will never be able to enjoy life again.""

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Not quite, there are plenty of democracies with monarchs as a head of state, and this is separate from the issue of having a head of state and head of government in personal union. You're probably confusing the two because you've grown up in a presidential system where you have such a personal union, but for a modern democracy this is an exception.

Since you've posted this you must be interested in constitutional theory, so a short civics lesson seems to be appropriate:

A [Head of State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state) is nominally the highest office of a country, but in modern democracies only has a (mostly) representative role [edit: should be ""in *most* modern democracies"". E.g., in France the president is very powerful, and in Russia it depends on which office Putin holds at the time]. In the UK ([among others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_headed_by_Elizabeth_II)), the head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. In Germany, it's President Gauck. You've probably never heard of him, because a few formal constitutional line-of-defense measures like signing laws aside, it's more of a social role than day-to-day politics. Yours of course is President Obama. The difference between a monarch and a president is that a president heads a republic and draws her or his legitimacy from the people, whereas a monarch heads a monarchy and traditionally draws hers/his from a convenient deity.  
Note that I've just made a distinction between a monarchy and a republic, and that democracy has nothing to do with it. Like Germany and the US, the UK is a democracy. It's also a (constitutional) monarchy, whereas Germany and the US are republics.

The [Head of Government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government), on the other hand, leads the executive, in modern democracies usually by getting elected by the parliament to head a cabinet of ministers. In the UK, that's Prime Minister Cameron, in Germany it's Chancellor Merkel. In the US, it's President Obama yet again, in personal union with being the head of state, which is one of the things that set the US apart from most modern democracies. Another example for where the head of state is also the head of government would be the federal states in the US or the ones in Germany, with their offices of governor or minister president, respectively.

En juillet 2011, le Parlement Européen a du voter pour ou contre la réintroduction de farines animales pour nourrir des poissons, [proposition venant de la Comission Européenne](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A7-2011-0195+0+DOC+XML+V0//FR), pour des raisons d'ultra-productivité.

[Une écrasante majorité (85%) de députés Français au Parlement européen ont voté ""non"" à la réintroduction des farines animales](http://www.votewatch.eu/en/legislation-on-transmissible-spongiform-encephalopathies-tse-and-on-related-feed-and-food-controls-m-2.html#/##vote-tabs-list-4).

Ce qu'il faut savoir, c'est qu'au niveau européen lui-même, **72% des députés européens ont voté ""pour**"", notamment tous les députés Allemands, tous les députés Tchèques, une grande majorité des députés Néerlandais ou des pays de l'Est.

Si nous étions en dehors de l'Union Européene, nous n'aurions pas de farines animales puisque les représentants français auraient voté ""contre"". Et si nous allons avoir à partir du 1er juin 2013 des poissons ou des volailles nourris avec des farines animales, c'est parce qu'une majorité de députés représentant d'autres Etats nous l'imposent.

On voit donc sur cet exemple très concret, que cela ne sert à rien de dire ""On va militer pour une autre Europe"", de se faire élir comme M. José Bové s'est fait élire prétendument pour avoir une Europe écolo: la meilleure façon d'avoir un viandе saine dans notre assiette, c'est de ne pas être au sein de l'Union Européenne et que les Français décident de ce qu'ils veulent et de ce qu'ils ne veulent pas.

La prime au scoop décrit très bien la course au stupides points internet et surtout l'enterrement des commentaires intéressants sous des tonnes de commentaires consensuels et donc fortement plussés. Certains sous-jlailus populaires et peu modérés sont insupportables à cause de ça.

D'ailleurs, les modérateurs sont un exemple de la régulation de l'information.

Bref, c’est un excellent poteau. Surtout le moment, où ils s'excusent de devenir un peu trop sérieux et ennuyeux. Comme si avant on se marrait à se taper le cul par terre.

En conclusion, pour rebondir sur ce qu'a dit /u/BobArdKor je trouve plutôt rassurante la réaction de jlailu à certaines vidéos sensationnelles. L'exemple que j'ai en tête est celui de Kony2012.

Here is an article by [Forbes]
(http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorieclark/2012/10/26/english-the-language-of-global-business/), another by [Businesscollege](http://www.businesstrainingcollege.com/business/is-english-the-language-of-business.htm)

On a global scale the most spoken languages are Mandarin, then Spanish, then English. However that is for native speakers, if you include non native you get:


* English 1.5 Billion 
* Mandarin 1.3 Billion
* Spanish 500 million
* French 220 million
* German 170 million


Now lets have a look at just the EU.
Currently German has the most native speakers, at 16% of the EU, English only 13%.

However if we take into account total speakers we get:


* English 51%
* German 21%
* French 24%
* Italian 16%
* Spanish 16%


Currently all EU documents must be in one of 3 languages, English, French or German. Seeing as more people speak English it is most often used.

23 countries in the EU have more people that speak English as a second language than any other, the only exceptions being Luxembourg, Belguim, Ireland and the UK where French is of course more common.

95% of students in the EU study English. At these rates in 50 years or less almost all of Europe will speak English.
 
It's a no brainer. English will continue to gain popularity due to a few things:

Firstly it's easy, the basics are simple, no masculin, femanine, you cannot have a male table, or a female cloud. Speaking English badly is still understandable, the same cannot be said for other languages

Secondly the majority of the EU already speak it, and it's the largest language on the globe.

Thirdly English is the fastest growing language in the world

Fourthly our biggest trading partner outside of the EU is the US, they speak English, it makes trading easier. China also a large trading partner and more and more turning to English to make trade easier.
Not to mention Canada, Australia and of course India whose official language is English (yes also Hindi) and is an up and coming world power.

For example, the temperature in a Jordanian winter is mild, but since there the houses are not isolated or equipped with central heating, you feel cold all the time. The Jordanians can't quite wrap their minds around the fact that we don't see a clear blue sky in Germany all that often. In Japan, the humidity in summer is ridiculously high, but anything with at least for walls is airconditioned, it feels like running against a wall of heat when you go out, while just wearing a shirt inside the supermarket might be too cold.

So:
I don't think you'll experience that much of a ""climate shock"" in Germany. Lots and lots of grey sky. Usually no more than 1-2 weeks without rain. Amount of snow varies. In Cologne, you shouldn't expect too much. 30km to the east, you're going to be stuck in snow. Well-isolated buildings. Ground-floor apartments are nice in summer, but really cold in winter, because the cold penetrates the earth.

Winter can make the country look bleak. If you want to go in winter, go in December and visit Christmas Markets. Spring is nice, but you can get anything from snow and frost to medium heat wave. Summer is okay, but probably as rainy and cloudy as in the UK. You always need a bit of luck with the weather. If it's sunny, it's really great though. It's usually not really humid unless there is a thunderstorm coming. But there is little to no air conditioning, even in public transportation.

true,YouBWrong,null,null,"&gt;Doing nothing is not the point of an ethics class, and I very much doubt that's what they're doing.

But they are.  In any case is teaching ethics (or religion) really what school should be there for?  Shouldn't parents be doing that?  BTW, thanks for implying that I am lying about this but my son has been going to these classes now for 3 1/2 years and most of the work that I see them doing (and there's not much) is coloring.

&gt;The rationale of religious education in public schools is to have supervision, to guarantee that the religious education kids receive doesn't run counter to the free and democratic foundational order. 

So... thought police?  Nice.  

&gt;The difference, however, is that the vast majority of German parents see it as the school's duty to do a good job, not as theirs to do it on their own.

When my daughter started school I can remember getting a letter from her school reminding us that raising our child was a ""shared responsibility"".  At the parent teacher assembly that followed I raised my hand and let them know that they were full of shit.  Raising my child is my responsibility.  Seeing that my child gets educated is my responsibility.  If I use teachers to help me with that then good, but at no point am I abdicating responsibility.  Most German parents that I know are not doing so either.  I don't know who the ""vast majority of German parents"" are that you're talking about.  I'm certainly not one of them.

&gt;Also, with regards to fitting in: You have to learn it. You learnt it. in your own way, on your own terms, and everybody is more than welcome to that. But not learning it at all isn't something I would wish on anyone.

Four paragraphs in your response and every one of them was bullshit.  This one tops them all though.  ""Fitting in"" for a boy the age of my son means learning to be as mean as the other boys and to learn how to hide or swallow your feelings.  It meant the same thing to me when I was a kid.  I learned how to turn my feelings into anger which helped me through highschool and I sure as fuck wish I hadn't.  Last meeting that I had with my kid's teacher she was telling me about how we have to teach him how not to get upset when the other kids are douchey.  I asked her if anyone had thought about teaching the other kids not to be douchey.

I never did learn how to ""fit in"", but I did learn how to not be scared of being rejected by other people.  I learned how to stay myself and make them accept me the way I am.  Very early on I realized I'd rather be a freak than a conformist.

It is interesting to note that both studies come from organizations with a vested interest in creating a demand for learning English and that the methodology used in determining these results were based on online polls which are, in case I have to remind you, highly unreliable. If you cannot provide data from unbiased sources then I'm afraid you have no case here. 

&gt;23 countries in the EU have more people that speak English as a second language than any other, the only exceptions being Luxembourg, Belguim, Ireland and the UK where French is of course more common.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Knowledge_of_German_EU_map.svg

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Knowledge_of_French_EU_map.svg
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Knowledge_of_Russian_EU_map.svg

German is more common than English in Central Europe.
French is more common in Western Europe than English.
Russian is more common in the Baltics, North-Eastern Central Europe and Bulgaria than English.



&gt;It's a no brainer.

It will be a no brainer when Europe speaks English as a first language. Until then, the EU is bound by its own laws and treaties to respect the language and protect the cultural diversity of each of its member states. 

&gt;Firstly it's easy, the basics are simple, no masculin, femanine, you cannot have a male table, or a female cloud. Speaking English badly is still understandable, the same cannot be said for other languages

http://www.xamuel.com/10-reasons-why-english-is-hard-language/

You underestimate just how convoluted the English language is. To a non-native speaker, learning English would be a nightmare. 

&gt;Secondly the majority of the EU already speak it, and it's the largest language on the globe.

The majority of the EU also speaks German, French and Russian.

&gt;Thirdly English is the fastest growing language in the world

Which is not relevant to an issue specifically affecting the EU. 

&gt;Fourthly our biggest trading partner outside of the EU is the US, they speak English, it makes trading easier. 

Trade would be even easier if we mimicked US consumer rights. 

&gt;China also a large trading partner and more and more turning to English to make trade easier. 

Higher ups in Chinese companies will, naturally, know English alongside a bunch of other languages as well. The average Chinese person on the other hand won't. 

&gt;Not to mention Canada, Australia 

Should we learn Mandarin as well? After all, if you account for proficiency Mandarin is the most spoken language on Earth.

true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"&gt;By comparison English is know to be simpler, sure it can get hard but the basics are easy.

Knowing the basics of a language is different from knowing the language itself. English is one of the hardest languages to learn because of its convoluted nature. Also, a non native speaker will never attain the proficiency of a native speaker. In order for English to become the administrative language of the EU you'd have to have at least 70% of the EU population capable of speaking English at an advanced level which is not the situation right now. 

Making English the official language would also be met with fierce resistance.  It will most likely be seen as an attempt at undermining the cultures and languages that permeate the individual EU member states and an attempt at enforcing British exceptionalism. You cannot deny that English would definitely give English politicians an advantage over the rest of the union members in every facet of the EU's administrative and political body. The same can be said about making any language native to an EU member state's population official. 




&gt;Please point out the benefits of taking German, Spanish, French or Italian over English as a lingua franca.


English, whilst classified as a language of Germanic origin, has very little in common with the rest of the languages spoken on the mainland, including German. The EU has 202 million Romance language speakers; all of them would definitely find French, Spanish or Italian easier to learn than English. People speaking languages of Germanic origin number in the hundred millions and the legacy of the Austrian Empire is still felt in Central and Eastern Europe where German is taught as a secondary language alongside English. The cultural impact France had on Europe still lingers on today, numerous countries also have French as part of their curriculum. 


&gt;The EU has a 51% rate of English speakers, it's the only language over 50% and so the only majority language. The next highest is only 27%. 

How many of those 51% can speak it fluently and how many of those who can speak it fluently can speak it on par with an English person?

War halt der erste comment zu dem post...also eher: nein

&gt; Das hat nichts mit Erleuchtung zu tun, nur mit Wertschätzung einer anderen Erzählkultur, die eben nicht nur auf Effekthascherei und aufgewärmter Urmythologie1 beruht.

Is ja genauso schwachsinnig wie wenn ich zu deinem Wiener Philharmonie-Poser-Addendum gesagt hätte: ""Der Strauß schonwieder? Aaaalt."" 

Aber gut. Gehen wir nochmal die Fime durch:

Star Trek 1. Eine Sonde hat das Wissen des Universums aufgesammelt und kommt daher zu ihrem Schöpfer zurück. Am Ende ist die Lösung **Liebe**. Hm welch ein neues Konzept von dem wir noch nie gehört haben. Vor allem nicht in [Star Trek](http://de.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Ich_hei%C3%9Fe_Nomad)(Viel bessere Umsetzung dieser billigen Idee die wir so auch schon öfter in SciFi Kurzgeschichten in den Dekaden davor hatten). Mal abgesehn davon, daß der Sonde die alles Wissen im Universum aufgesammelt hat das Konzept von Liebe irgendwie bei den anderen Rassen entangen sein musste?! Welch eine intellektuelle Erzählstruktur...welch ein Plot....oder auch nicht. Eigentlich lässt er nichts zu. Alles wird ausgesprochen was man sich in dieser flachen Geschichte, deren philosophischer Anspruch sich in bestenfalls 3% des Materials äußert denken muss/soll. Man ist sogar gezwungen sich dumm zu stellen um über das Offensichtliche hinweg zu sehen. Der Rest sind endlose ""effekthaschende"" Blicke über, in und mit der Enterprise und ihrer super Crew die eigentlich bis auf die o.g. 3% zu überhaupt keinen geistigen Sprüngen kommt. Es geht eher darum nochmal die Crew zu sehen. 

Kommen wir mal zu 2 und 3. Die ja eigentl. einer sein könnten. Es geht also um ""das Altern"" in 2 sagst du? Wirklich? Wo wird das den dort intelektuell aufgearbeitet? Mir fällt spontan eine Folge TNG ein (alter Wissenschaftler muss auf den Planeten zurück weil seine Lebenszeit abgelaufen ist und er eingeschläfert wird. Eigent. Alle Folgen mit Mutter Troy) die mehr zum Thema beigetragen hat als alles was Kirk insgesamt je dazu auf den Tisch gelegt hat. Ich habe bis heute noch niemanden getroffen der es wirklich ernsthaft versucht hat gerade diesen Teil als intellektuelle Höchstleistung elitären Ausmasses zu verkaufen. Google mal ""Khan"". Das beste ist jedoch das Ende. Der Held opfert sich für den Rest nur um im nächsten teil wieder aufzuerstehen. Hmhmhm wo habe ich die Story schon mal gehört?? 

Star Trek 4 ist eine Rettet-die-Wale-Komödie mit den bekannten Stars aus Star Trek und einer Menge unvergessener ""Effekthascherei"" (Wer liebt nicht die Park-Szenen. Schon das Raumschiff!). Ausser dem gibt es dort nichts. Es ist funny und natürlich sollten wir die Wale retten. Die Botschaft war damals schon alt. Die Idee, dass ein mysteriöses hohes Wesen kommt welches mal wieder die Welt vernichten will ist hierbei schon so nebensächlich und inzwischen so oft wiederholt, dass es gar nicht mehr weiter behandelt wird sobald das Intro durch ist. So viel zu Wiederholungen.

Teil 5 aka "" Suche nach dem Transzendenten und von falsch verstanderer Spiritualität"". Du machst wohl Witze. Kaum ein Teil hat so viel Wert auf Äusserlichkeiten gelegt wie dieser. Man sieht sogar Uhura nackt auf der Düne tanzen...Sie fliegen in das Zentrum der Galaxis (neu?) wo Gott wohnen soll was durch gefühlte 5 Stunden Effekte aus irgendeinem Hippielabor begleitet wird nur um dann MAL WIEDER auf ein Superwesen zu treffen und dieses zu entschärfen. Woher kommt mir DAS den nun bekannt vor?! An dieser Stelle hat die Einfallslosigkeit der Macher seinen absoluten Tiefpunkt erreicht. Es war die Wiederholung einer Wiederholung einer Default TOS Episode. Zwar genauso wie bei den vorhergehenden Filmen, jedoch fehlte hier komplett die Nebenstory die den Zuschauer irgendwie wach halten sollte. Statt dessen gab es die nackte Uhura und ab dann nur noch Farben und inhaltsbefreites Geschwätz. 

Ich kenne Trekkies. Ich bin mir sicher, dass nicht einmal die sich erdreisten würden einen solchen philosophischen Kontext anzudeuten wie du es getan hast. 

Schlussendlich Teil 6 aka ""eine ziemlich offensichtliche Anspielung auf das Ende der Breshnev-Ära und der aufkommenden Perestroika... Winds of change, halt. "". Schon deine ""Verblumung"" trägt einen Hauch ""aufgewärmter Urmythologie"" mit sich. Genauso haben es sich wohl die Macher gedacht. Anstatt mit etwas kreativen zu kommen, haben sie einfach die Reale Story in Star Trek umgemünzt wobei sie auch noch mit dem Vergleich Praxis=Tschernobyl mächtigst ins Klo gegriffen haben. Wo soll da der Intelektuelle Anspruch sein wenn man das einfach nur aufwirft? Wo waren da die neuen Ideen? Neue Lösungen? Auch nur irgendwas wo es sich lohnen würde über das servierte hinaus zu denken (was ja die eigentliche intelektuelle Leistung gewesen wäre). 

Da ist nichts. Die Filme mögen zwar den Anschein eines intelektuellen Kinos geben, sie sind es aber nicht. Sie waren es nie und sie werden es auch nie sein. Es sind nämlich Kinofilme. Gemacht um konsumiert zu werden und zwar genauso wie sie präsentiert wurden. Wie ich gezeigt habe werden auch hier immer wieder alte Geschichten aufgewärmt und im Gegenteil zu Star Wars, werden sie handwerklich schlecht aufgewärmt. Es kommt sogar zu Wiederholungen. Mehrmals! Die Einfallslosigkeit der Autoren geht sogar so weit, dass sie alte Serienfolgen kopieren.

Es ist aber lustig zu sehen, dass du anscheinend wirklich gedacht hast, ich hätte das mit der Erleuchtung ernst gemeint. Dabei sollte es eigentlich nur veranschaulichen mit welch billigen Mitteln du versuchst dich und eben auch die Star Trek Filme und im Kontext auch ARTE als etwas besseres hinzustellen. Du bist auf die pseudointelektuelle Show der Filme und meines obigen Kommentars reingefallen...und das durch einen Star Wars Fan und somit potenziellen RTL Zuschauer. Welch eine Schande.

According to the Greek government's own privatisation handbook, here, these industries are losing €1bn per year and currently have €10bn accumulated debt (page 5).

Your work is shoddy. The pdf you link to only says the railwork was losing €1bn per year and had €10bn accumulated debt. That was a few years ago. Since then the corporation has changed its was and is now breaking even. The debts were taken by the Greek state. Besides, the railway is not even in the list of corporations that I mentioned would be privatised in 2013. 

This is ridiculous. I don't have the time to look up every little thing you say to uncover the ways you are deceiving yourself and me just to make your point. 

&gt; That document makes clear the dividend payout was not 100%. The Greek government received 34% of that figure.

Still, it's an asset that generates profits. The fact that said profits are not liquid does not make them any less valuable. 

&gt; Most first world countries have privatised core industries like this

Haha. Let us take the list of rich countries one by one and see how many have privatised water, gas and electricity. 

&gt; The gamble being taken will be that privatisation will make it even more profitable, thus accruing the Greek government great income in the long-term.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt;  COSCO aims to make the container port a hub to rival Rotterdam - Europe's largest port.

So, Cosco's optimistic statement of intent is enough for you to dream up fantasies of extreme increases in revenue generated through taxes? Good for you, I guess. 

&gt; I'm curious about the method used to compare what the two ports will do in the future.

When you own the port yourself, modelling the situation is simple: Reducing the price each customer needs to pay brings more customers. If the profits from the expected increased customer base are greater than your current profits then it is a wise move. See? Simple. 

When you don't own the port yourself, you need to think about indirect things like taxing employees and the investment invigorating the local economy. In this case, it is much harder to calculate if it is a wise move. 

My point is not that Cosco's operation is necessarily bad for the Greek economy. My point is that you bringing up the port of Rotterdam is like comparing apples to oranges. That situation is much easier to reason about that the Piraeus port. 

&gt; As more customers will transport their goods via Piraeus, profits from the deal with Cosco will be used to upgrade OLP's Pier 1.

That argument makes no sense. If Cosco's investment relies on increased revenue from an increase in customers, then why the hell do we need to sell it to them? It's better to keep the port publicly-owned and decrease costs to the customers so we can have more customers by ourselves?

*As digital TV replaces our old analogue TV, four-fifths of the airwaves that used to carry TV broadcasts to our homes will be freed up. This means that they can be used for new, innovative services that use radio spectrum, from wireless internet and more advanced mobile phones to new interactive and high-definition TV channels.*

* The digital dividend proposals adopted by the Commission today ask EU Member States to speed up the switch-off of analogue TV and to complete it  by 1 January 2012. Five countries (Finland, Germany, Luxemburg, the Netherlands and Sweden) and the US have already shown that analogue switch-off can be done quickly 
(IP/09/266).  

* The proposals also seek to realise the potential €20 to 50 billion economic impact of effective European coordination of the digital dividend (over 15 years compared to EU countries acting alone). To do this, they set out how one part of the freed-up spectrum, namely  the 790-862 MHz sub-band  (the spectrum that travels far and through buildings), can be set aside to support the emergence of new wireless 
services (such as 3G and 4G mobile phone services (IP/09/1238 ) that allow video streaming, full web browsing and fast downloads on a mobile handset. This will contribute to achieving the target of high-speed broadband coverage of 100% of the EU population by the end of 2013 (IP/08/1771 ,  MEMO/08/735). 

* To maximise the impact of these moves, the Commission said it would  harmonise the technical conditions  for using the 790-862 MHz sub-band so that the Single Market is not fragmented when EU countries open the sub-band for new services in their country. Service providers and makers of devices and applications can then do business across borders, while consumers will find it easier to use 'roaming' services when they travel.

&gt; modelling the situation

The model is simple, but it has other properties. The state owns the port and leased part of it to a company that would upgrade it and bring customers immediately. It did. The state didn't have any money to upgrade it, and couldn't offer that business advantage in such a short time. A company offering the full range of operations associated with a commercial port would have a special interest in moving away from other ports. It does. If the state finds that it could revise the contract to its benefit in the future, it will.

The name Portucale evolved into Portugale during the 7th and 8th centuries. By the 11th and 12th century, Portugale was already referred to as Portugal.

The etymology of the name Cale is mysterious. Some historians have argued that Greeks were the first to settle Cale and that the name derives from the Greek word kallis (καλλις), 'beautiful', referring to the beauty of the Douro valley. Still others have claimed that Cale originated in the language of the Gallaeci people indigenous to the surrounding region. Others argue that Cale is a Celtic name like many others found in the region. The word cale or cala, would mean 'port', an 'inlet' or 'harbour,' and implied the existence of an older Celtic harbour. Others argue it is the stem of Gallaecia. Another theory claims it derives from Caladunum.

In any case, the Portu part of the name Portucale became Porto, the modern name for the city located on the site of the ancient city of Cale at the mouth of the Douro River. And Port became the name in English of the wine from the Douro Valley region around Porto. The name Cale is today reflected in Gaia (Vila Nova de Gaia), a city on the left bank of the river.

To be precise:

250g margarine  
300g flour  
4 eggs  
250g sugar  
2tsp backing powder  
1tsp [Sodium bicarbonate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate)  
200g chocolate (moderately dark, I think, the baking stuff)  
2tsp cocoa powder  
4 ripe bananas  
2tsp cinnamon  
1tsp nutmeg  
1/2tsp ground almonds  



Bake at 175 degrees for one hour. The end result should be, for a cake, very juicy.

If I had a proper oven I would've tried it, and be able to tell you more about it. In particular,  I have no idea what the almonds are for, and I'd probably try to replace all the sugar with bananas, if possible. Without disintegrating the cake, that is. And use 90% dark chocolate, the *good* stuff. And make sure to get [the right cinnamon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon#Species). The sodium bicarbonate (replacing part of the usual amount of baking powder) is to kill any left-over acidity from the bananas.

The Gutnish language exists even today, with a scant few speakers.

The Finns and the Sami were always here and they were equally the subjects of the ruling monarch of the kingdom of Sweden as was everyone else (well, ok, the nomadic Sami probably less so, but still). That's the thing about the old European nation states that is pretty tricky: Sweden was't founded by Swedes for Swedes: it was funded by noblemen for noblemen. Most of the time the ruling nobility and especially the monarch weren't originally from the country (case in point: current dynasty). It didn't matter to them what peasants they were ruling, be they Svear or Geat or Finn, and for the most part they certainly didn't have the good of the people in mind. Even when they were ethnically cleansing Scania it wasn't because of any idea of inherit racial superiority: the peasants there were still loyal to the Danish crown.

The idea of tying ethnicities to nationalities is a fairly modern one.

The summer is noticeably hotter though. It goes much longer without rain, followed by plenty of thunderstorms. I'm not the biggest fan of hot weather but I do enjoy the predictability of June/July/August = generally hot and sunny, not having to guess what the weather might be like!

And there's definitely a lot more snow here in the winter, although I think England has had extra snow the last few years as well. The temperature also tends to be quite a few degrees lower on cold days. And like the heat in summer, the cold stays around for longer.

true,r0ckarong,flag-de,,"Ok das wird eine längliche Antwort. Was Howard Stern auszeichnet ist sein Sender. Howard Stern moderiert ja mittlerweile auf SiriusXM einem privaten Sender den man soweit ich das verstehe nur per Subscription hören kann. Stern hat früher ein beinahe identisches Format auf WNBC moderiert und wurde für seine Aussagen gefeuert. 

Es ist wichtig zu erkennen dass Sender wie HBO, FX, AMC oder halt SiriusXM erstmal nicht der direkten Kontrolle der FCC-Zensur unterliegt da sie, wie man das auch immer auslegen will, nicht *öffentlich* senden. Stern hat sich durch seine kompromisslosen Äußerungen ein Namen gemacht. Es gibt andere Radiopersönlichkeiten (Opie &amp; Anthony) die ähnlich operieren. 

Es ist halt immer ein Auslegungsproblem wie man ""polarisierend"" definiert. Für mich ist ein Künstler dann polarisierend wenn er sich mit seiner Meinungsäußerung Kritik zuzieht aber dennoch viele Gleichgesinnte (schlimmes Wort) hat. Mir würden da spontan Leute einfallen wie George Carlin, Doug Stanhope, Jim Norton etc. das sind alles sehr kontroverse Komiker da sie in ihren Programmen Dinge erzählen die der Otto-Normalverbraucher so garnicht verarbeiten kann (zu schmutzig, zu anstößig, zu pervertiert o.ä.).

Wenn du dir jetzt im Bezug auf eine spezifische Sendung z.B. SouthPark anschaust dann merkst du (unter Berücksichtigung der Umstände) dass diese Sendung nur existiert weil sich ein Sender (ComedyCentral) in Verbindung mit dem 2nd Amendment (freie Meinungsäußerung) traut überaus umstrittene Inhalte zu senden. Da sieht man prima polarisierende Inhalte die trotzdem (oder gerade deswegen) erfolgreich sind. Die Folge mit der Mohammed Karikatur von SouthPark wird nur deshalb nicht mehr ausgestrahlt weil sich die Macher vor verirrten Islamisten fürchten und nicht weil die Zensur des Staates es verhindern würde.

Mein Lieblingscomedian ist und bleibt George Carlin der dank seiner teilweise recht angepassten Nummern großen öffentlichen Erfolg hatte. Bekannt wurde er aber durch Sachen wie ""Seven Words you can't say on TV"" (Shit Piss Fuck Cunt Cocksucker Motherfucker and Tits).

Es gibt solche Dinge in Deutschland auch aber wir haben keine wirkliche Platform dafür. Die wirklich ""anstößigen"" (in meiner Lesart interessanten) Künstler werden auf Kleinkunstbühnen und private (Internet-)Auftritte verbannt. Serdar Somuncu zum Beispiel hat sich eine große Fangemeinde erarbeitet mit seiner kompromisslosen Arbeit, wird im Fernsehen zu Talkshows eingeladen und steht in der Tagesschau als Integrationsexperte zwischen den Meldungen. Von seinen Programmen (den interessanten Teilen) wird nichts ... garnichts ... im Pop-Fernsehen gesendet. Er hatte bis vor kurzem einen zweiminütigen Einspieler in einem anderen Joko-Klaas Vehikel ""Neo Paradise"" das wie zu erwarten auf einem ZDF Spartenkanal tief in der Nacht zersendet wurde.

Ich könnte dir noch diverse Beispiele aufzählen von umstrittenen Sendungen aber da sich die Moralsstandards der USA so von unseren unterscheiden würde das wahrscheinlich (mit Erklärungen) zu lange dauern. Eines muss man den Amerikanern lassen, sie haben mit dieser Auslegung des 2nd Amendment eine Grundlage dafür geschaffen mit kontroversen Inhalten Kasse zu machen. 

Da der deutsche Pop-TV Olymp von Kapitalgesellschaften beherrscht wird die sich jedweder Konfrontation scheuen (jeden vergraulten Zuschauer rechnet man mit Verlusten hoch) haben wir eben keine polarisierenden Inhalte mehr. Politkritisches Gutmenschenkabarett kann man vermarkten. Selbst die Heute-Show die an sich ein billiger zahnloser Abklatsch der Daily Show ist kann man jeder Hausfrau erklären denn billige Merkelwitzchen und Schlagzeilenbashing ziehen immer. Da versteckt man dann mal den einen oder anderen guten Witz dazwischen aber es traut sich niemand mal richtig auf die Kacke zu hauen (da sowas niemand absegnen/finanzieren würde).

Also TL;DR: Opie &amp; Anthony, SouthPark wären zwei Beispiele. Gerne mehr wenn jemand sich dafür interessiert Walls-of-Text zu lesen.

EDIT: Kleine Anmerkung weil mir das gerade erst eingefallen ist. Alle deutschen Sender agieren prinzipiell erstmal *öffentlich*. Früher gab es sowas wie ""Premiere"" die man nur per Abo empfangen konnte und daher andere Dingen senden konnten. Der Anteil der ""explizit nicht öffentlich zugänglichen Medien"" nimmt zwar im Rundfunk (wenn man das noch so nennen will) rapide zu aber man operiert dort immernoch nach den gleichen Prinzipien die der ""Öffentlich Rechtliche"" und der (aufgemerkt) ""Öffentlich Private"" Medienzirkus sich als Wirkgrenzen erarbeitet hat. Die Kabarett-Legende Diether Hildebrandt hat gerade erst mit einigen Leuten zusammen eine Kampagne gestartet um [per Crowd-Funding eine ""echte"" Kabarettsendung im Internet](http://stoersender.tv/) auf die Beine zu stellen. Das wäre so ein Modell wie ein Bezahlsender der kontroverse polarisierende Inhalte möglich macht.

Hier nochmal die wundervolle Zusammenfassung von dem was Stoersender.tv werden könnte. Das deckt sich alles mit dem was ich oben versucht habe krampfhaft zu beschreiben.

The name of Romania has nothing to do with the name the Byzantines used for themselves. It's simply that both the Romanians and the Greeks (Romaioi) called themselves ""Roman citizens"".

The native name of Wallachia was Țeara Rumânească (""Rumanian Land"" &lt; Vulgar Latin ""Terra Romanesca""). ""România"" was a neologism coined from ""român"" (Romanian) in order to be used for the whole Romanian nation (as opposed to just Wallachia).

Well, the language is descended from Latin and that's what matter. Any claim of genetic purity is nationalist nonsense and that's valid for any nation.

We're all a mix of people from across the continent. I'm not surprising

&gt; The Romanian language isn't slavic even though it used to be written in Cyrillic because there are clear Latin influences

""There are clear Latin influences"" is an understatement. The core vocabulary is 80-90% inherited from Latin. A lot of the ""lesser"" vocabulary is indeed Slavic, but that doesn't change the basic fabric of the language.

Profiling exists as an important part of the police force - the problem with racial profiling is that although it's an easy way to profile it's a largely ineffective one which just wastes the time of a large group of people who are continuously targeted.

I have no problem with profiling by ""race"" if they have a profile that INCLUDES race - just as long as it's not the sole identifying marker. Let's say the police are looking for illegals on the underground - they can check the papers of brown people *who are begging*. This group is far more narrowed down and likely to include illegal immigrants. Due to bureaucracy in Sweden it's hard for illegal immigrants to get jobs. White people begging are more likely to be Swedes or homeless people from the Schengen area. So this makes far more sense as a way to profile. Just as an example - in reality homeless people are rarely targeted by the police here. They're after the people staying illegally in the country with friends and family.

""Svear"" comes from Old Norse ""sviar"", which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European ""\*s(w)e"" (+ ON nom. plural ""ar""), meaning ""oneself"", ""one's own"" or ""separate from others"" -- also the root of the modern word ""själv"", or ""self"" in English. ""Rike"" comes from ON ""ríki"", derived from Proto-Germanic ""rīks"" (king), which is actually a loan from Proto-Celtic ""rīxs"", ultimately stemming from PIE ""h₃rḗǵs"", also the source of Latin ""rex""/""rego"" and their descendants.

**Sweden**, the form in English, Icelandic (Svíþjóð) and a few other languages, comes from Old Norse ""Svíþjóð"" and Old English ""Sweoðeod"", both being a compound of ""sviar""/""sweonas"" + ""þjóð""/""þeod"", the latter word meaning ""people"" or ""tribe"", having the same root as ""Deutsch"" or ""Teutonic"", as mentioned above.

**Ruotsi** in Finnish and Estonian comes from the Old Norse prefix ""roðs-"", pertaining to rowing, probably referring to the coastal area of Eastern Sweden in olden times called ""roðan"", today called ""Roslagen"", the teams of rowers.

The Greek name for Greece is *Hellas* (Hellada in modern Greek). Hellen, according to Greek mythology, was the son of Deukalion (in other versions Zeus) and Pyrrha and the patriarch of all Greeks, after a cataclysm (similar to the Noah story) wiped out the population of earth.

The word Hellene (Greek) came to mean pagan during the christianisation of the eastern roman empire and Greeks adapted the name Romioi (a variation of ""romans"") during the Middle Ages and the Ottoman rule.

The word Hellas/Hellene revived during the war of independence in the 1820s.

Another interesting story is that the turkish name for ""Greek"", *Yunan*, is derived from the ancient Greek word Ionian. Ancient Ionia was part of the western coast of minor Asia.

The full stories behind all these names are even more complicated, with multiple ancient sources (such like Homer, Hesiodus and Aristoteles). There is a [detailed article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_Greeks) in Wikipedia about this.

They are also very conservative and have a very structured education system that the US system doesn't always mesh so well with.  It's not so much a complaint as it is an observation.

On another etymology, Sellas/Hellas comes from the root Sel which means light (northern lights are called selas/σέλας in Greek, the moon is called Selene/Σελήνη etc.) and the suffix ""las"" which roughly means stone (like lithos/λίθος). So Sellas/Hellas is light stone or holy stone.

Greece comes from a neighbouring village/tribe (or perhaps it was how Illyrians called Selloi). Its roots are even more obscure, but the root Grae- probably meant something like (Graeii/Γραιοί means old ones). So Graeki means old men (or perhaps wise men). Note that Selloi/Graeki were probably involved in the Dodoni Oracle, which was dedicated to Zeus, so there may have been a large number of priests (hence the ""old men""). This is further supported by the Georgian name for Greeks, Saberdzneti, which literally means ""wise people"" 

Yunan comes from Ionia, which was the name of a region of Greek colonies in Asia Minor, in what is now Turkey, near Izmir/Smyrna. Ion (apart from a brand of chocolate) was the name of one of the three tribes that consisted second wave of tribes that formed Ancient Greeks.

Since you seem to be a rude idiot, I'll answer this in a way even you can understand. 

We do not want a union. Same reason the Americans do not want a union with Brazil, Russia and France. Not because you particularely hate them, but you are Americans, not French/Brazil. You do not want to rename your country the ""Great France"", or whatever the name is going to be, nor are you to keen on importing, how can I say it, ""the somewhat allowing attitude towards bribery in Russia"" nor are you interested in the Russian orthodox Church explaining what they should do in the senate. You do not want to be outnumbered in a few years but the Brasilians, and spend most of the federal money un Russia. I can go on forever why you do not want it - not because you hate Russians/Brazilians/French people in particular, you just do not believe in that a union with them would work. You are the US, they are France/Brasil etc - good so. Sure, you do not mind perhaps starting a trade union with Brasil and a education exchange with France - but *you are not one country*.

On paper it would probably be great, just like you said. You would be the absolute biggest country in the world, have superduperpower, and, you would have this great senate (they might even let it be in Washington every 4th year).

true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"&gt;The name of Romania has nothing to do with the name the Byzantines used for themselves. It's simply that both the Romanians and the Greeks (Romaioi) called themselves ""Roman citizens"".

What do you mean? Are you saying it's a coincidence the name romanians choose to call their nation is exactly the same as the name of the Byzantine Empire, the successor state to the Roman Empire? It was in the interest of the newly formed nation of Romania to distinguish itself from the surrounding slavic populations in order to legitimize itself in the eyes of the Great European Powers who, at the time, didn't exactly view the slavs in a positive light. It's also why the Cyrillic alphabet was abandoned and why Romania is now part of the Francophonie. 

&gt;The native name of Wallachia was Țeara Rumânească (""Rumanian Land"" &lt; Vulgar Latin ""Terra Romanesca""). 

Do you have any reliable sources that show the romanians living in Wallachia called themselves that or that people outside the principality itself referred to it as such before the 1800's? Don't forget that Moldavia and Transylvania existed alongside Wallachia as well.

&gt;Well, the language is descended from Latin and that's what matter. Any claim of genetic purity is nationalist nonsense and that's valid for any nation.

When determining something as complex as the ancestry of an entire ethnic group the language itself is not enough. Genetically speaking, romanians are not latin.

&gt;""There are clear Latin influences"" is an understatement. The core vocabulary is 80-90% inherited from Latin. A lot of the ""lesser"" vocabulary is indeed Slavic, but that doesn't change the basic fabric of the language. 

Actually, the core vocabulary is a mix of French (38%) and Latin (20%).

And the beach is so fucking long and wide that there are always lonely beaches and ""calas"" (I don't know how to say that in English), combined with a great nightlife.
OP, you must check that out before deciding. Google ""Conil de la Frontera"" and ""calas de Roche"". Galicia and Santander and Islas Cies are great places, but keep that in mind: while the Atlantic is very wild and with short, rocky beaches (with exceptions) and the Mediterranean is hot, flat and dirty, and with little rocks instead of sand (with exceptions), but ""Costa de la luz"" (Conil and other towns surrounding) are in the Atlantic but the waters are warm and not very wild because it is next to the Mediterranean. The weather is better than anywhere else in Spain. You can even go to Tarifa (40km) and watch Africa from there. There's a ferry (25€ return) if you want to visit Morocco.

Or, they are liberals, the special kind.....

It is one of those things that looks good on paper, but don't work out in real life (like a union between Brazil/US/Russia). Also, if we are speaking strictly financially, for a currency union to work the economies have to be somewhat similar or the transfers will be enormous (example East/West Germany, they have pumped in trillions into East Germany), For the transfers to be enormous, there needs to be public support and a working transfer system. We have, (nor will we have it, since we don't really want to)neither. Unfortunately, one can see the consequences of that in southern Europe. I feel very sorry for them (and think they should leave the Euro who is wrongly constructed), but there is no way in hell I am going to send 20% of our GDP south. Nor do I want Brussels to have more power - I want less. Frankly, our politicians seems better at balancing the budgets and less corrupt then they do.

true,andyv,ROMA,Romania,"&gt; What do you mean? Are you saying it's a coincidence the name romanians choose to call their nation is exactly the same as the name of the Byzantine Empire, 

From a linguistic perspective, choosing Romania as the name of the country was quite obvious . The people were calling themselves ""Ruman"" or ""Roman"" well before the creation of the state. Adding the ""ia"" termination for the name of the country is used in many other cases (Rus**ia**, Bulgar**ia**, Grec**ia**)

&gt;Do you have any reliable sources that show the romanians living in Wallachia called themselves that or that people outside the principality itself referred to it as such before the 1800's? Don't forget that Moldavia and Transylvania existed alongside Wallachia as well.


Neacșu's letter (from 1521) used the name ""Romanian Land"" (cěra rumŭněskŭ) for Wallachia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neac%C8%99u%27s_Letter ). 

Cazania lui Varlaam  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cazania_lui_Varlaam ) is another document from 17th century which uses the term ""romanian"" to refer to the people living in Moldova. 

Other sources ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Romania ): 

&gt;Other first-hand evidence about the name Romanians used to call themselves comes from authors having lived in Transylvania and/or Romanian principalities: the Transylvanian Saxon Johann Lebel confirms in 1542 that common Romanians call themselves ""Romuini"",[8] Orichovius (Stanislaw Orzechowski) notes as late as 1554 that ""in their own language, Romanians are called Romini, after the Romans, and Walachs in Polish, after the Italians"",[9] Anton Verancsics writes around 1570 that Romanians living in Transylvania, Moldavia and Walachia call themselves Romans (Romanians) [10] and Martinus Szent-Ivany cites in 1699 Romanian expressions: ""Sie noi sentem Rumeni"" (modern standard Romanian ""Şi noi suntem români"") and ""Noi sentem di sange Rumena"" (in modern standard Romanian ""Noi suntem de sânge român"") [11]

The idea that romanians descend  from romans is much older than the 19th century national movement (which clearly overemphasized it).  ",0,1363216560,null,0,1363246632,0,c8v5gbw,t3_1a7ydk,t1_c8v5gbw,t1_c8v441x,null,1431576918,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7
