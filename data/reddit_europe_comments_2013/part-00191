true,Djmedic,null,null,"&gt; Hallstein was a member of several nominally Nazi professional organizations[i],[j][11] but, critically, he was not a member of the Nazi Party or the SA.[1] He is reputed to have rejected Nazi ideology[12][9] and kept his distance from the Nazis.[4]

I guess you didn't read the part where he accompagnied the Fuhrer with talks to Mussolini. Or you didn't quote it because you don't like it.

&gt; As many veterans of the Bulge or the Battle of Berlin will tell you, the Battle of Cherbourg wasn't anywhere near ""the end of the war"".

Your point being ?

&gt; And Hallstein was a common PoW, a serving army officer captured in battle, much unlike those scientists flown to the US in Operation Paperclip.

The Americains certainly got a hold of scientists such as Werner Von Braun, who had worked on the V2 and then went on to work on the Apollo missions, but they also used politicians, jurists. It is very much alike Operation Paperclip, they certainly didn't turn up their nose at Nazis when it suited their interests.

&gt; You also forget to mention that Monnet, Schuman and Spaak were all three prominent figures of anti-Nazi resistance during WWII, definitely not the type to cooperate with a former Nazi.

Please. I can't speak for Spaak, but Monnet was a businessman, had a perfect English (which was rare in those years), had very close ties with the Americans. Everybody knew at that time he was their man.

Schuman's father took the German nationality after the French defeat in 1870 and married a Luxemburger. Schuman was a student in Germany, dodged the draft (rare choice in 1914), served as German officer in the administration. Letters he wrote to his brother were found saying that, with the impending defeat and despite not knowing France at all, he was ready to adopt this grand new family. He then took the French nationality after the German defeat in 1918.

Schuman was an admirer of authoritarian regimes of Franco and Salazar. He applauded the Munich Agreement, was one of the first to call for France to lay arms down and cease this fratricidal war (against Nazis mind you), voted plenary powers to Petain, accepted a nomination as minister in the first Vichy government.

Yes, he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and this 50-year old man managed to escape. That's heavy surveillance for a dangerous opponent for you there. Did he try to contact the French Free Forces ? No, he went into hiding and waited in countryside churches, with plenty to eat during the blackmarket.

At the Libération, he was deemed ""ineligible"" and made ""unworthy"". He was able to lift the sentence thanks to his ties with the Vatican, and because De Gaulle wanted the French to make peace between each others, not because he tought highly of Schuman.

He managed to get ten nominations as minister in the notoriously instable Fourth Republic. According to his contemporaries, he was someone ""lacking imagination"", ""boring"" but who knew extremely well how to dodge fire in ministerial crises.

He was a turncoat and a puppet in the hands of the US, who wanted to establish an autoblocking system where no real decision can be taken due to constant diverging interests. Just as the USSR had their bloc, the US had theirs with the EU and NATO.  The fact that Hallstein went to Georgetown University should ring a bell, it's a university where the CIA picks potential agents, and where ex-agents teach.

The difference is that seduction and corruption of the minds is a much better way to brainwash people. That's why the USSR exploded, and agreements were signed between the US and France at the end of WW2, wich would open France to the US film industry and sell the American ""way of life"" to the French, for example.

&gt; As for Evans-Pritchard's allegations against them, he's not an unimpeachable source himself.

If I say that 1+1=2 and 2+2=5, that fact that my second statement is wrong doesn't mean my first one is incorrect. Attack his arguments, not him, or you're just making an ad hominem and you lose credibility.

&gt; Yes, the US actively supported the European movement in the postwar years. Good for them.

And bad for those who don't want their countries turned into vassals of an empire. Let's just invert the situation for a second here, what would happen if you had a political party financed by a foreign country's secret services in America ? There would be a massive outrage. It seems to me that you're saying it's no big deal when the US do this.

true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"&gt; There's no evidence whasoever that Ireland negotiates special tax deals with individual companies. Back it up. 

From the first lines in the OP's link (an article in the Irish Times):

*Europe’s top competition authority has asked the Government to explain its system of tax rulings and give details of assurances given to several specific companies.*

It could hardly be clearer, but let me give you some more evidence:

http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/23/us-apple-tax-ireland-idUSBRE94M0NU20130523

*By this stage, the European Community had banned tax holidays of the kind given to Apple, so the company and Dublin negotiated an arrangement which had a similar outcome but fell within European rules.*

*The precise details of the arrangement were not disclosed, but Phillip Bullock, Apple's head of tax operations, indicated that it was linked to minimizing taxable profit.*

*""Since the early 1990s, the Government of Ireland has calculated Apple's taxable income in such a way as to produce an effective rate in the low single digits,"" he told the subcommittee.*

Of course, the Irish government is [strenuously denying](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland/apple-denies-special-tax-deal-with-irish-government-1.1409879) what this Apple executive said before the US Congress, but [one can't say that the Dail is showing much zeal in investigating those allegations](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/ireland-mps-vote-google-apple-tax-inquiry). I wonder why. Well, of course I don't. What I really wonder is why the Irish public, already suffering the direct consequences of the coziness of its politicians with big businesses, isn't up in arms over these ""alleged"" deals.

&gt;L'évaluation fera la part belle à l'engagement : assiduité, ponctualité, participation. Les étudiants devront en outre se répartir une petite dizaine d'exposés, pas plus d'un par séance ? Enfin chaque étudiant remettra un écrit sur un thème littéraire (étude d'un personnage par exemple) ou sur un thème de société (la presse, le sport…) ; dans ce travail soigneusement rédigé, il référencera les citations : quel tome ? quelle page ?

Comment tu peux accorder du crédit à un cours avec ce genre de trucs. Un exposé sur le Quidditch ! Une analyse de la psychologie de Albus Dumbledore !

There's a strong Labour representation too.  If you look at the Bruges Group's MP watch there is a real stalwart of scepticism.   Remember Labour was traditionally the Europe sceptical party and for a long time.  There are union movements that are openly anti-EU.

Everybody around Dave Cameron that might contest leadership is pretty staunch Eurosceptic and as such EFTA friendly.  Ken Clarke would have been a contender a few years back but not any more.  Clarke is the only one to have not signed the Localist Papers which require an EU exit...DC might not want to be the one to leave the EU but he passed the 2011 European Act and he signed the localist papers.

So yes, they have the question, the ministers are there, EFTA has the support, the electorate of the parties is in place.  The real pertinent point is that even Lib Dem MEP Andrew Duff has addressed the federalist Spinelli Group warning them to plan ahead without the UK.  The EU needs closer political union for the Euro to have any chance and there is extremely limited support in the UK to hand over more power.  And this is the crux...

The 2011 European Union Act means that even beyond an in-out-EFTA referendum any further powers going to Brussels need to go through a referendum anyway in their own right and there is virtually zero chance of that happening. - it regularly polls below 20% and sometimes 10%.  So if the EU wants closer integration then either the UK is going to block it or the majority get their way and they're allowed to go through EFTA.  Everything else is academic.

Puting catalan, basque or breton on a map of France is as legit as puting normand or picard or franc-comtois.

""But there is school teaching those languages in France, and many things are dubbed in those languages besides french in their region !""
Yes, but that's all. The teaching in school of regional languages is a way for France to show that the destructive standarization of the nation during the last 2 centuries is over. Which is ironic since it wouldn't be possible to ""standarize"" more anyway.

But it doesn't mean that you can inverse the process.

true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Note the use of 'effective rate.' Apple's EU HQ is in Ireland. Ireland's corporate tax rate deals with money generated in Ireland. It has nothing to do with Apple's income from other countries.

Wrong. You clearly don't know how this works. Apple (like other corporations) actually has several different subsidiaries in Ireland. Typically, at least one of them (notably their online store) operates throughout the whole European Economic Area, and therefore should theoretically pay 12.5% on their income, for all those European sales, in Ireland, not elsewhere. But how does then Apple manage to pay a much lower *effective* rate? Let's quote the Wikipedia article on the ""Double Irish"" tax avoidance scheme:

*It is called double Irish because it requires two Irish companies to complete the structure. The first Irish company is the offshore company which owns the valuable non U.S. rights. This company is tax resident in a tax haven, such as the Cayman Islands or Bermuda. Irish tax law provides that a company is tax resident where its central management and control is located, not where it is incorporated, so that it is possible for the first Irish company not to be tax resident in Ireland. The first Irish company licenses the rights to a second Irish company, which is tax resident in Ireland, in return for substantial royalties or other fees. The second Irish company receives income from exploitation of the asset in countries outside the U.S., but its taxable profits are low because the royalties or fees paid to the first Irish company are deductible expenses. The remaining profits are taxed at the Irish rate of 12.5%.*

So, most of the income from the sales of the second, tax-resident subsidiary throughout Europe is funneled to the first, non-tax-resident subsidiary through those royalties and fees. As a result, its ""remaining"" income is close to zero, and its effective tax rate just as reduced.

Of course, for this to work, it is important that the Irish tax authorities don't look too closely under the bonnet. Otherwise they may find out that most of those ""royalties"" and ""fees"" are for grossly overvalued IP or inexistent services. Hence the importance of those ""tax rulings"" mentioned in several of the articles, in which the tax authorities rubber-stamp the submissions of those corporations' highly-paid tax lawyers. Also, you need that special Irish treat, the non-tax-resident company. But it's in the ""tax rulings"" that the European Commission smells a rat and, from my experience in these matters in another small, welcoming European country, and looking at the words of that Apple executive before Congress, I have reason to believe that they are right.",0,1379005180,null,0,false,0,cc6yk12,t3_1m8hye,t1_cc6yk12,t1_cc6xrfw,null,1429488215,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Brussels - Don't bother, given your limited time
Amsterdam - If you are into Marijuana, definitely go. Otherwise, still a good option but you may prefer others
Berlin - If you like a more modern, stylish and urban feel

&gt;In the 16th and 17th centuries, English foreign policy strove to prevent creation of a single Universal Monarchy in Europe, which many believed France might attempt to create. To maintain the balance of power, the English made alliances with other states—including Portugal, the Ottoman Empire, and the Netherlands—to counter the perceived threat. These Grand Alliances reached their height in the wars against Louis XIV and Louis XV of France. They often involved the English (later the British) paying large subsidies to European allies to finance large armies.

et

&gt;During the 19th century, to achieve lasting peace, the Concert of Europe tried to maintain the balance of power. This policy was largely successful in averting a full-scale Europe-wide war for almost a century, until the First World War. Specifically, during the first half of the 19th century, Britain and France dominated Europe, but by the 1850s they had become deeply concerned by the growing power of Russia and Prussia. The Crimean War of 1854–55 and the Italian War of 1859 shattered the relations among the Great Powers in Europe; however, the creation and rise of the German Empire as a dominant nation restructured the European balance of power. For the next twenty years, Otto von Bismarck managed to maintain the balance of power, by proposing treaties and creating many complex alliances between the European nations.",0,1379006977,null,0,false,0,cc6z928,t3_1m40aj,t1_cc6z928,t1_cc6ygcx,null,1429487891,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

If we part ways, we can negotiate it in a friendly manner or you can have it all.

In 2012, the Infrastructute Ministry budgeted for Catalonia 11,2% of the total amount, which dwarves when the Catalan economy represents 18,6% of the GDP. In 2011, the Infrastructure Ministry only executed 35% of the total budget for Catalonia while 111% in Madrid.

Also, being indebted with someone else doesn't mean that they can do anything they want, as long as Catalonia pays in the established period, there is nothing to fear.

A lot of people were mad because he was one of the few Croats who were charged and sentenced for larger crimes, and by releasing him the court said that he did not commit crimes and since nobody else is being charged it seems like the court is saying that nobody on Croat side did anything wrong, or at least court is stopping the investigation while in the meantime they're continuing with charges against Serbs.

true,ajehals,null,null,"&gt;Yes, it is not out of religious beliefs, I'm just saying that if some people do not want to participate in these swimming classes they shouldn't be forced, after all being forced to do something even if it was for your own good, you'd still think it is unfair at first at least.

I suppose the point is that most countries do have mandatory primary and secondary education, people are forced to do things they probably don't want to do, whether that's maths, science, cross country running, swimming or something else.  Its supposed to be a foundation to ensure people have an equal start in life and its mandatory... So no, people don't have a right to opt out of mandatory education.

&gt;What I mean is governments shouldn't interfere with these policies because not everyone come from the same background.

I think its find for a government to ensure that everyone has access to and has access to the same opportunities when it comes to education (and indeed when it comes to the law more broadly..).  Religious, social and cultural differences should probably be accommodated where possible and where it doesn't cause harm (we are tolerant societies are we not?).

&gt;And from the Muslim point of view I remember reading a quote from the prophet Mohammed saying that you should teach your children horseback riding, swimming and archery.

Indeed, which complicates matters even more to some extent - I would argue you either make swimming optional for everyone, or it is mandatory, in this case it would seem that there is no reason for it not to be mandatory, that the good outweighs any negative.

I suppose the counterpart to this could be something like the parents of a pacifist child asking that their kids not take a particular history class, because they think it glorifies warfare, or sends a message counter to what they believe - we would generally look at it and say, actually no - its a component part of the curriculum and you can't pick and choose,- learning that element of history isn't going to cause someone to reject their parents views and they are entitled to know about it, in much the same way that swimming lessons aren't going to cause any actual problems for the child or their faith and at some point in the future it may mean they don't drown..

At the end of the day I don't think the argument here is one about equality, it is about what level of veto parents should have over what schools do - that is a societal question and one that all of us, regardless of religion, race, gender, sexuality etc.. have a hand in shaping all the time.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"Well there's a world of difference between what the EU is now and what it was as the EEC.

Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives were big fans of the EEC and only turned off it when talks over Maastricht were beginning, famously in her [1989 Bruges Speech(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkRwMFy0CVM)].

The first half of the Bruges Speech was Thatcher lauding praise on Europe and the close relationship.  The second half was her warning that if you take it down a political union with Maastricht then the UK won't be able to follow.  She argued with John Major over how far the UK could go towards a currency then Black Wednesday happened and that ended that.  

But the UK has been asking for this conversation for nearly a quarter of a century, and warning for half that time that it was sailing into a crisis and going where the UK would not follow.  It's just come to a natural point.

What you have to remember when the EEC was set up is the world was awash with high tariffs.  They effectively set up a customs union, somewhat outdated but across a large market so it worked.  Tariffs with globalisation dropped the world over but the EEC and later Europe has kept them.  As a case example mobility scooters or vehicles coming into the EU have a 10% tariff leveled on them unless them come from a free trade agreement.  The UK could leave the EU on Monday and lower its global tariffs on Tuesday and start a boom opening new markets on Wednesday - and it wouldn't cost the taxpayer a penny.",0,1379011211,null,0,false,0,cc70w04,t3_1m8lgh,t1_cc70w04,t1_cc70f1h,null,1429487056,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

- They advocate allowing judges to make appropriate sentences for convicts as the judiciary sees fit.  It's recidivism and protecting people from illicit authoritarian acts a.k.a. crime.

Get control of the courts and immigration.

Regain a seat on the WTO.

Remove around 70% of regulation on Small and Medium Sized businesses.  EU regulation actually has to cover all UK businesses even though only ~10% of the total GDP comes from Europe (80% is domestic).  In EFTA it need only cover that which deals with Europe.

Negotiate our own tailored trade deals.

Regain control of fishing.

Regain control of agriculture.

Regain control of cohesion fund spending.

Make massive savings on Single Market contributions.

Regain control of energy costs, dropping out of 20-20-20.

Be able to make VAT or a Local Sales Tax far more progressive.

Have a veto on all EU regulation.

Have a UK trained judge to represent cases involving the UK at the EFTA court.

All EFTA communications are only in the native language of the country and transcribed into English.  Massive savings on bureaucracy because they've already accepted English as the lingua franca.

Regain sovereignty and get out from under federalisation.

No secondary parliamentary costs through Brussels or Strasbourg.

true,HappyReaper,null,null,"As a Valencian citizen, ""Valencià"" is the name we give to the variety of Catalan spoken here. To expand a bit more:

Catalan as a wider language has two versions that we call ""constitutive"", as they were there ""from the beginning"": oriental (which was spoken in the eastern part of the territory) and occidental (spoken mostly in the western part, in what is now the province of Lleida). As new lands were taken from the Moors, they were repopulated with people from already controlled territories; in the case of Valencia, it was with people from western Catalunya and Aragón, and in the case of the Balear Islands it was with people from Eastern Catalunya.

With time, every area's speech evolved a bit further, in what we call ""consecutive"" varieties. In this context, ""Valencià"" is the variety we speak in Valencia, while the one they speak in Balear Islands is often called ""Salat"". You can still go even further with consecutive varieties, as even in a region like Catalunya or Comunidad Valenciana there are wildly different accents and minor particularities (for instance, the variety spoken in the area where the city of Valencia is located is called Apitxat).

Still, even the differences that exist today between constitutive varieties (the biggest separation) are too little for any serious linguist to consider them different languages. The ""debate"" about that is of political origin and relatively recent (late 70s), but I already made this response too long to deviate that way now.

EDIT: Sorry, I read your comment quickly and missed the sarcasm. Anyway, I wanted to make it clear that at least for now the basic history and nature of the language is still taught to children in many schools (not in all of them, unfortunately, for political reasons).",0,1379013158,null,0,1379019279,0,cc71n2q,t3_1m8ngv,t1_cc71n2q,t1_cc6u9hz,null,1429486705,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,modomario,BELG,Belgium - Flanders,"&gt;The point of the xkcd is, that if a map only provides population density information, it's kinda useless.

...eh close but not really the person in the xkcd can't deduce from the charts that the people using their site are all furry loving Martha Stewart fans. Why? because every map on there somewhat corresponds with a population density map of the US. Because their average amount of users probably contains an average amount of furries and an average amount of MS. fans.

 The point that Bilgistic was trying to make with this is that we can't deduce from the map that this thread's about which Europeans pollute the most on average because the map corresponds so heavily with a population density one.

The point that I was trying to make was that this is not 100% true. You previously added to that point by saying that cities should be darker. However the cities you mentioned for example house almost no heavy industry therefore they are not as dark as you'd tink they might be, and the cloud above northern Italy is a bit darker then it should be (if it was fully matching with a pop.density map) due to geographical reasons (mountain around industrial valley making it so that wind can't spread the pollution as much.)

They've settled (not necessarily out of their own volition) in that Southeastern part of Transylvania in order to protect the frontier of the Kingdom of Hungary starting in the 12th century. 

Also, even though it doesn't appear on this map, there were also German people in the Southern part of Transylvania know as Transylvanian Saxons. They started migrating in the area around 1141. The thing is that in the last decades most of them left for Germany (especially during the Communist regime), so their dialect is not spoken very much anymore.

Another German population in Romania were the Banat Swabians. They settled during the 18th and 19th centuries. Very few remain since they also left for Germany and Western Europe at various points during the 20th century.

true,AgentGotse,BULG,Bulgaria,"I can see that Ms Kroes has mastered the art of deception very well. All of the submissions and titles of articles that I have seen on the matter focus on the roaming charges. The bad news is of course that she wants to kill net neutrality. To make matters even worse, this article gives the **incorrect** impression that this legislation will protect net neutrality : 

&gt;Laws to protect net netrality will still allow companies to provide services with assured quality levels, such as video on demand or business-critical cloud applications, so long as they don't interfere with the speeds promised to customers. Customers would also have the righ to check they are receiving the speeds they have paid for and cancel the contract if they are not met.

When in reality, this is the complete opposite of what is happening. 

First of all, here is what Net Neutrality means (from wikipedia)

&gt;Net neutrality (also network neutrality or Internet neutrality) is the principle that Internet service providers and governments **should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, and modes of communication**.

Here's what Ms. Kroes has to say in one of the linked articles :

&gt;The reforms will also seek to **""guarantee"" net neutrality** by preventing operators from blocking or throttling competing services, while **allowing them to offer ""higher"" or ""guaranteed"" speed services** according to user needs — a move that seems to be in-line with Kroes' comments earlier this year supporting the right of operators to sell a ""basic package for a lower cost” but not discriminating against services. 

http://www.zdnet.com/europe-unwraps-single-market-telecoms-package-offers-operators-a-roaming-law-dodge-7000020471/

Talk about fucking doublespeak. Net neutrality is not guaranteed in any way -- this is exactly the opposite of net neutrality. 

Also, read this whole article : 

http://www.zdnet.com/net-neutrality-let-the-market-decide-says-europes-digital-chief-7000009955/

From the horses mouth : 

&gt;Telecoms providers should be able to impose restrictions on internet traffic they deliver over their neworks, Kroes wrote in an article for the French newspaper Libération.

She clearly wants to kill net neutrality, but notice how she never actually says that in the article -- instead she paints net neutrality as an attack by the government on the free market (regulating ISPs to do things) and as limiting choice to consumers. 

All of this is of course conveniently bundled with an amazingly popular proposal (remove roaming charges) in order to limit opposition to the legislation.

Fuck you Ms. Kroes. If we want to get actual debate on net neutrality then it needs to be presented on its own, not like this, and preferably without all of the doublespeak.

Edit : Also, relevant from here :

http://euobserver.com/economic/121397

&gt;For his part, Jeremie Zimmermann from La Quadrature du Net, a French NGO promoting internet freedom, called Kroes' bluff on net neutrality.

Also, you made it sound as if Hallstein had gone directly from the prisoner camp to Georgetown University, when in fact, he had gone back to Germany at the end of the war, and been the first post-war rector of Frankfurt University, before going as a distinguished visiting professor to Georgetown University.

If you try to restore someonе's image to use him as a puppet, you might  as well try to do it smoothly. A hop at the Frankfurt University certainly doesn't hurt, don't you think ? It's already quite a pill to swallow. The Americans simply picked up his models of Europe's domination where he had left them.

Speaking of which, you do know there's a partnership programme between Sciences-Po and the French-American Foundation. In my opinion, that's not very unlike Georgetown, elite intellectual milieux are infiltrated. Dupont-Aignan is a 'Young Leader' of the FAF, as Hollande is. Do you really think Hollande is someone who would take a stand against the US ?

&gt; And r/conspiracy is that way

Sure, De Gaulle was a conspirationist as well, right ? That silly old goose and his secret services. On a more serious tone, just go read his Memoires, you'll have enough examples of Roosevelt and Churchill trying to take advantage of France's weakness that would explain his behaviour. 

He was at the front seat. He knew Americans wanted puppets in front of them, like Laval, Petain, Giraud, Darlan. Never would they have chosen hard-headed  De Gaulle. No, they even continued to have diplomatic relations with Vichy one year after Pearl Harbour.

Do you know who didn't like conspiracies either ? Those who removed the concepts of high treason and of plotting against the state from the French Constitution, in one of its discreet cleanups they have nowadays.

&gt; you'll feel more free to slander long-dead people

Everything I said has references, if you don't like those, you can go ask them directly. 

&gt; some of whom actually put their lives at stake for your freedom.

Do you realize you want us to respect a guy who applauded the Munich Agreement, voted plenary powers to Petain and accepted to participate in the Vichy government ? An ex-Nazi and shadowy figures who wanted to manipulate governments and their peoples ?

What unbound cynicism. De Gaulle went to London alone  to continue the fight, knew what the Americans were up to, defended your country's interests and world image by refusing both American and Soviet vassalisation. Where was your Schuman, tell me ?

France was respected at that time, just as it was respected when she was opposed to Nazis, when she was opposed to the war in Irak. Thousands lined up to learn French in 2003 after a single speech, as it had showed them that maybe, all hope is not lost for France.

And she's is hold in contempt being Washington's lapdog in neocolonial wars under Sarkozy and Hollande. 

Puppets, that's all they are, including the French far-right and far-left movements. One ends up asking to vote for Hollande, and the other smears the debate for national sovereignty and democracy with extremist comments. That's why she's paid for, look up at her party's financing scandal in the 80's.

true,Zakerias,NETH,Swamp Germany,"I have a friend who is disgusted by any form of nationalism, he says 'how can you be proud of something you didn't actively take part in?'. Which I agree with logically, but disagree with emotionally. You could say the same thing to parents who are proud of their child. The only difference is that nationalistic pride comes culturally and parental pride comes genetically.

To be honest, I like the feeling of pride I get whenever I read about my country's history. I consider myself a result of that history. I realize that's a miguided view, but it's also comforting. This feeling of pride I get is purely an emotional state that makes me happy to be part of. If I was born in Sweden or Italy I would have been proud of something else, but the experience would be the same. With the good comes the bad though. I also feel connected to the horrible things my country did in the past. I believe the feeling, wether good or bad, can be inspirational.

That is why I feel nationalism (or patriotism) is something that shouldn't be considered to be inherently bad. I completely agree that it can be dangerous when you combine nationalism with populism, or when you claim that anyone who doesn't share your culture is backward or evil. But in moderation nationalism can be inspirational and comforting.

- I don't know where this 15-20% comes from. In 1994, however, CR's gdp grew a 3%. Slovakian GDP a 6%. They have been growing very well and fast with some drastic trends, as expected in developing economies.
- SL and CR had to walk a reversed transitional valley (reestructuration of socialist economy).
- Socialists statistics had a lot of lies.
- They had to start competing with capitalistic economies for their own internal market, as well as being flood by (reestructuring) investment.
- Their exportations had to meet international standards.

We're in the EU. We comply with its standards. We export +50% of our production. 30% of the spanish industrial output is produced in Catalonia. 

So chill the fuck out. I can't talk for myself because I don't have that specialization in economy, but there ar experts who can and will manage the situation. There will be negotiation, and agreements will be reached regarding common debt and assets. It can be done and shall be done ordenately, for it is of the interest of all parts.

There's however an exeption: If you create a ""copy from an obviously illegal source"" (""soweit nicht zur Vervielfältigung eine offensichtlich rechtswidrig hergestellte oder öffentlich zugänglich gemachte Vorlage verwendet wird""), it becomes illegal.

So there are two aspects:

1. Is it a copy? Sounds like a stupid question, but there is still a debate going on weather streming is at all creating a (temporary) copy on your PC. As far as i know, there are several contradicting rulings from lower German courts, but there is still no established opinion. So it might be a copy, which would make it illegal if the answer to the following question would be yes:

2. Is it an illegal source?
That's a bit of a grey area. Netflix obviously owns the rights to the shows for some countries, but not for Germany. However, in my opinion the source is still legal, as Netflix is blocking German users. Circumventing this block isn't punishable for private users in Germany. So i would say no, it's not an illegal source.

IANAL, but i would say streaming from Netflix is legal in Germany.

- a suo tempo, mi smazzai forse centinaia di pagine per studiare teorie, debunking e controdebunking e i complottisti non sono mai riusciti a convincermi

- il complotto sarebbe comunque ridicolo. No, pensateci. Il governo Americano vuole una scusa per attaccare l'Afghanistan (e che cazzo c'è in Afghanistan? tante belle capre?); per farlo prende una dozzina di terroristi Sauditi affiliati a un gruppo il cui capo sta in Afghanistan, li piazza su quattro aerei, poi due li fa schiantare nel WTC (e ok), uno in Pennsylvania (perché?!) e uno lo fa sparire ma spara un missile sul Pentagono (eh?!). Già che c'è, oltre alle torri gemelle demolisce anche un edificio lì vicino.

Tutto questo per andare a invadere l'Afghanistan, paese in cui non c'è uno straccio di risorsa naturale, privo di ogni rotta commerciale di interesse ma in cui è difficilissimo combattere (e infatti stanno ancora là).

No perché se mi dite ""il governo americano ha mentito per invadere l'Iraq pieno di petrolio"" io ci credo (ci sono le prove, sono caduti governi per sta storia), ma se mi dite che tutta sta manfrina è stata montata per invadere l'equivalente mediorientale delle montagne rocciose dovete tirarmi fuori dei motivi belli importanti.

O se mi dite ""ma no, il complotto serve per creare lo spauracchio del terrorismo e passare le leggi sul controllo globale"" io vi rispondo ""e sticazzi, questo come spiega i due aerei usati per non fare un cazzo, non bastava tirare giù le torri gemelle? volevano andare sul sicuro? perché allora non tirarli su altri due grattacieli?""

La teoria alternativa, cioé quella realistica, è che un gruppo di terroristi sauditi che ce l'hanno a morte con l'america ha approfittato dei varchi nel sistema antiterrorismo americano per tentare un tipo di attacco mai nemmeno pensato prima, mirando ai simboli del potere americano (economico, militare, politico (l'aereo fatto cadere dai passeggeri doveva andare forse sulla casa bianca)).

there are shades of grey here, not just a simple dichotomy... some prioritisation makes sense - just from the nature of the services (see above)

I have no problem if they designate email protocols as low priority for example - it makes sense in fact.

Since Lisbon, the majority of legislation has to pass both chambers, and can be amended by both chambers, so the Parliament is actually fairly powerful now. A good example was the Parliament stopping ACTA, something both the Commission and the Council were behind.

The Commission has only one legislative power, that of initiative, and the reason it has that is to stop politicians introducing unnecessary or nationalistic legislation. Once the Commission has made a proposal, though, it has no power over how that legislation is then amended by either the Parliament or the Council. In addition, the Commission only generally starts the legislative process on foot of a proposal from the Council or Parliament.

We directly elect the Parliament, and indirectly elect the Council, while the Commission only, in effect, has the power to choose not to legislate. Our biggest democratic problem is that we don't exercise sufficient control over what our governments do on the Council (particularly true for Ireland), and our second biggest problem is thinking the Parliament is just there for show.

Respectfully, I don't think you can make a direct comparison. Switzerland have a unique political, economic and geographic position that is the most part of their wealth.  

Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland etc unemployment rate is mostly due to being in an overvalued currency, and being unable to devalue debt, and wages.
http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/debt-and-devaluation-mediterranean-edition/
Greece being the extreme example. 
http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/david-mcwilliams/david-mcwilliams-greece-must-leave-euro-if-it-wants-to-halt-death-spiral-26887378.html

The PIIGS (barring Greece, and maybe Portugal) weren't bad economies to begin with. 

The PIIGS do need labour market reforms. But of the right form- incompetent employees etc. I am pretty centrist, government programs can work if they are building productive infrastructure, not iron rice bowl employment. 

Also open labour markets such as Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland have strong and well designed social insurance. Sweden and Denmark is one of the easiest places to fire an employee, however, they have strong social insurance: Flexisecurity: http://www.da.dk/bilag/Flexicurity%20in%20Denmark.pdf 

The problem with pure market philosophy, is a Austrian School is a economic philosophy and rejects the use of empirical evidence. And, b, insecure workers cause a balance sheet recession- whereby even the better off are afraid to spend, and save, crushing aggergate demand. Depressed wages having a similar effect. Even in export driven countries such as Ireland the vast majority of employment is the internal. Scared employees dont buy cars, houses, or go out for meals causing continued contraction and vicious cycle of job loss. It also causes people to be afraid to leaves posts for more suitable jobs, interfering with market efficiency.
http://www.boeckler.de/pdf/v_2012_10_25_koo.pdf

The Spainish labour isnt very well regulated if people are working 120hrs on part time wages- why arent we seeing a employment boom? There are no customers?

The neo-classical theory assumes perfect rationality and perfect knowledge- which dont exist. It also assumes that profits return to normal profit (circa 4%) quickly, profits result in reinvestment and higher wages trickling down. In the US corporate are at a record high (12%), but wages at record lows, reinvestment is extremely low (4%). http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8177af34-eb21-11e2-bfdb-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2ejADnrkS

I do not disagree with labour reforms per say, it is the type that is the problem. Using internal devaluation, and no security, will only crush internal economy beyond any benefits from regained competitiveness 
http://kounfinance.blogspot.ie/2013/04/internal-vs-external-devaluation-and.html 

TL/DR:
Unemployment caused mostly by uncompetitive currency, and inability to devalue and rebalance market. 
Sucessful open labour markets in Europe have strong, intelligent social insurance. 
Apprehensive employees dont spend, reducing demand, thus reducing employment, in a continuing vicious cycle.
Internal devaluation is crushing the peripheries already.
Neo-classical theories assume almost perfect trickle down and investment, which is not happening at the moment.
Labour market reforms are needed but they need to be balanced such as flexisecurity and not 'pure market' reforms

I've heard that they are considering changing/extending the program. They claim good results from it circa 30% continuing employment afterwards. However there are massive problems with abuse of the scheme. Firms we taking on interns and flipping them for another intern when there time expired. Many jobs were menial jobs, with no illusion of up-skilling. So essentially the state were paying for their janitors, or laundry workers, instead of someone actually being employed. 

The state pays for all the wage of the intern, which I think is wrong. If the company paid lets say 100€ it would incentive them to take on where there is a chance of a genuine future job. And if you cant make 100€ a week of someone, you shouldnt be taking them in the first place.
Also firms should be limited in the numbers they take on with out employing them after- lets say 5-1 ratio.  

15 companies have been band from the scheme, but that's no where near the level of abuse of the scheme. 

Either way the effects o the scheme will be negligible as the real problem is collapsing aggregate demand. A firm wont take on an employee no matter how talented if there is no extra demand for their products and services. This the Irish government are still in blind denial about.

true,observer,EURO,European Union,"While, as previously stated, eventually we'll have to agree that we disagree (especially given the limitations of a forum discussion), what baffles me is that I don't know what you are proposing. You construed my point accurately, I am saying that less taxes would mean less pain and in the long-run would make for a healthier and fairer economy etc. 

You on the other hand say that the effective tax rate is not indicative because it only applies to a few well-off wage earners. On the face of it I can understand your point although I have a few issues with it: a) The highest tax rate applies to anyone with a yearly gross income of above 42.000 (so divided by 14 wages and after insurance/taxes are withheld it potentially kicks in to people with net wages even below 3.000€/month) b) Lower tax brackets have a proportionately high rate relative to most of our EU partners especially if we look at the 'effective' side of things (essentially adding insurance contributions that are generally high for both employers and employees) c) this indicator ignores various other taxes that are asphyxiating the economy (2 property taxes, one of the highest VATs, second only to Finland eurozone-wise in addition to the fact that most countries have VAT exceptions for a wide range of goods whereas Greece has very few, high ’road taxes', high taxes on oil which now makes gasoline in Greece among the most expensive in the world, special (temporary?) taxes such as 'solidarity tax' etc.). But let's set aside these things, you already said that you are not for more taxes for people in the above categories. What is your solution for bridging the gap in the budget? You already indicated that you are against laying off people. Clamping down on tax evasion and black market economic activity? Higher corporate taxes? If it is the former I wholeheartedly agree with you on this and admittedly there have been a few steps towards this direction (judging by how I get invoices wherever I go, judging by how SDOE started doing its job properly, by how the state -at last- prosecutes those owing to it, by how penalties are becoming stricter and -yes, this is news unfortunately- have started being actually enforced etc.) although one can justifiably argue that it's too little, too late. But to claim that the 20+ bn euros we were missing can be found by annihilating tax evasion and little else is -to say the least- overoptimistic. Better-organised and larger countries have failed to dramatically increase revenues by fighting tax evasion (let alone that fighting tax evasion results in less ('black') economic activity, e.g. the various live events that were cancelled this summer due to SDOE getting its act together and thus the state ends up with less-than-the-expected revenue). If it is the latter then we simply disagree. I think it's almost self-evident that if you raise corporate taxes more (consider not just the tax rate but also other parameters that are factored in indicators -where Greece is at/close to the bottom- such as the 'cost of doing business', 'ease of doing business' etc.) this could only result in more bankruptcies, businesses closing down or at best downsizing (and in the process, firing more than the hundreds of thousands they already did) and so on. 

Incidentally, your interpretation below was wrong:
&gt;It's the outcome that matters, not the claim. If the bureaucracy is ineffective and these people and corporation did not have to pay their taxes in full, that can only mean that the money was left for them to do as they please, which is what you wanted in the first place.

Overtaxing some, because you cannot collect taxes from the rest is not only contrary to my view but is also contrary to basic economic logic. You over-exhaust the healthy sector of the economy (citizens/corporations that are already doing their duty) which is not only unfair but also entails reduced economic activity and thus reduced tax revenues from your only 'guaranteed' contributors. Moreover, given that those with significant undeclared incomes usually attempt to 'hide' them in tax heavens abroad or spend them in conspicuous consumption (usually imported luxury goods), even letting rampant tax-evasion completely loose benefits the economy less than having less economic activity but declared and duly taxed. So tax rates DO matter and given that an increase in rates can provide immediate results (in the short-term at least), if you are saying the state should have focused more in raising revenue than it did then imho this could only be done (in the substantial magnitude it was required and in so little time) only by raising the rates even more than it did (of course this would only had short-term effects, if at all).",0,1379039386,null,0,false,0,cc7b6yl,t3_1lwqcq,t1_cc7b6yl,t1_cc6v107,null,1429482154,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

If I'm crazy enough to not want my kid to learn to swim because they might mingle with other kids, then I'm probably going to screw up the kid in some other way that (short of taking the kid away) the state can't prevent.

It's a similar argument to drug laws. The druggies that mess up their own lives or the lives of others are going to do that regardless of the legality of the drugs. Criminalizing drugs only means that citizens that want to follow the law, can't do them.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; According to the Office of National Statistics, Britain paid £16.6bn and received £6.9bn (including rebate), therefore Britain paid £9.7bn last year.

Telegraph blogist's interpretation of the numbers is not correct. Just for one example that sum includes duties collected on behalf of the EU. As they are not UK's monies to begin with they are not UK's contributions.

And it doesn't make much sense to pick a single year because the annual net contribution varies quite a lot under the period of MFF.

This is much more accurate calculation of UK's contributions to the EU budget through years 2000-2011: http://ec.europa.eu/budget/financialreport/wel/images/financialreport/en/annex3_1_en.png

As you can see under that period the annual net contribution has varied from -€5,567 million to +€955 million or about -0.33% - +0.06% of UK's GNI.

&gt; The question is then whether a saving of £8bn is worth everything that EFTA membership brings but not having EU membership loses.

There would be no saving of £8bn as the net contribution would not get smaller by that much.

There's also many other relevant questions such as:

3. As a desert, Kaiserschmarr'n is also very tasty. [Here's a recipe](http://www.austria.info/uk/austrian-cuisine/kaiserschmarren-1561302.html). 

tofudoener's suggestions are also very good. The classic Oktoberfest food would definitely be the chicken.

Important for the Brotzeitplatt'n are not only good cheese and meat, but also good bread. Go for dark rye with a crispy crust. Same goes for pretzels, they should have a crispy crust, but be soft on the inside.

Stamattina sentivo il giornale radio: 
'Vittoria' dell'italiano:
la Corte Ue annulla i bandi di concorso scritti in inglese francese e tedesco
http://qn.quotidiano.net/cronaca/2013/09/12/948849-corte-ue-bandi-annullati-no-italiano.shtml
Il solo fatto che qualcuno si sia svegliato un mattino, abbia deciso di iniziare questa protesta/causa e la cosa venga poi festeggiata come una vittoria è l'indice di una malattia degenerativa.


Oppure ricordo un trasmissione in agosto su radio24 dove si parlava dell'eliminazione di geografia dai licei:
http://firmiamo.it/appello-in-difesa-della--geografia
La gente chiamava e commentava robe del tipo:
""mio figlio senza il tom tom non sa andare da nessuna parte, io invece..."" lui invece a quanto pare ha fatto geografia stradale a scuola, che poi il figlio se ha la patente vuol dire che geografia a scuola l'ha fatta, nonsense su tutta la linea.
Me la ricordo geografia...""in veneto si coltivano: patate, fagioli, lattuga,..."" e in emilia? ""in emilia ci sono 4.379.348(wiki now) abitanti[quei tipici dati utili,longevi e significativi] e si coltivano: patate, fagioli, lattuga,..."". Niente per la gente che chiamava era una perdita colossale. 
""Di cosa parleranno le guide turistiche???"" che pena infinita...


Altra trasmissione e mi ritrovo un ""luminare"" tutto scandalizzato perché usiamo troppe parole inglesi, e poverino l'italiano, e per dimostrarlo afferma che è una vergogna che noi si chiami un nostro ministro ""ministro al welfare"" perché il ministro del welfare è, cito testualmente, ""il ministro degli straccioni"".


I corsi in inglese al politecnico no perché ""poi la gente non capisce""...il che significa che c'è gente che studia materie tecnico/ingegneristiche su testi solo italiani...non so bene per le altre materie ma studiare testi italiani di informatica è un ottimo modo per imparare a lavorare il legno.


...e le sparate sui matrimoni gay che distruggerebbero la terra/la famiglia/la natura, le schifezze fatte negli ospedali per infilare a forza il cattolicesimo nella gola di chiunque(spacciandolo per bioetica perchè ultimamente il marchio regge sempre meno), il solo fatto che qualcuno dibatta su berlusconi come se lo scorrere degli eventi in merito a quest'ultimo avesse una qualche rilevanza superiore allo zero assoluto, e le stupidaggini degli italiani che ""abbiamo tutto noi: l'arte, la cultura, il cibo...se solo le sfruttassimo saremmo tutti ricchi"", e la laurea non serve andate a fare i pizzaioli, e ""noi siamo il cambiamento...il mondo è sotto scacco del bilderberg"", ecc...(verso l'infinito e oltre)


La ""soluzione"" non esiste perché la mentalità stessa che produce questa domanda è errata. E' un intera cultura che deve morire e può morire solo con l'effetto congiunto della morte delle persone che già l'hanno acquisita e l'obsolescenza tra le persone che non l'hanno ancora acquisita.
In sostanza ad ogni generazione il problema si attenuerà perché ""essere italiani"" sarà semplicemente sempre meno efficace, efficiente e desiderabile.

'Withdraw from EU' or 'abolish EU' for a start aren't Eurosceptic positions, they're outright anti-EU.  There's a difference.  

Euroscepticism, especially in the UK, has been trying for decades to focus on reform.  The last example was David Cameron's speech on Europe at the beginning of the year.  The reason why he's come under so much pressure is precisely because when asking for reform and a change in direction he was told by Germany and France no less that it was a domestic matter for the UK.  They shut down the conversation straight away.

Thatcher started the call for the reform dialogue in 1989 before Maastricht was even written.  Farage himself, as proExit as anybody, talks about supporting Blair's call for reform back in 2003 but then attacks him for when he did the opposite he called.  There have been countless calls for reform.  For a start there was a very clear message sent about the Constitution but they went ahead with it in all but name with Lisbon.  The resistance to any reform other than closer  integration to federalism has always been there.  Germany have just released a reform party.  There is calls for reform everywhere.  It's just that those running the S&amp;D, EPP and ALDE aren't listening and smaller parties feel they have to join these blocs if they are to be heard at all -let alone when it comes to reform.

Think about what you just said however, by lumping repatriation of some powers in with an EU exit and what it means when it comes to discussing reform.  You've argued there can only be reform if it is in a certain direction.

'Populism' is how Federalist groups have identified they will identify their target/opposition and how it will be addressed, even though they admit that it's very difficult to actually lump together when you start to look into it.  It's not stopping them from tying populism in with extremism either.  I find it all very distasteful and contrary to political and democratic discourse.  Then again I don't see the word 'populism' necessarily in a prejorative sense.  Common sense is populist, and it's a dashed handy thing to have.  A few more common populist policies and politicians might learn to actually talk and discuss some of their more serious differences once they know that they have things in common and how indeed to cross the aisle.

Don't you see how predictable he was the entire time. Of course he would ""denounce"" Agenda 2010, it is one of the major issues the SPD has. Voters really hated it. And do you really think his ""talking straight"" is really anything more than just to set him apart from ""Mommy"" Merkel. This last ""stunt"" is just there to show those undecided voters that he isn't as weak as everybody thinks.

&gt;And besides all of this: Election campaigns are probably the purest form of PR/marketing there is, so blaming him for doing a PR stunt is kind of ironic because all they (candidates of all parties) ever do are PR stunts.

Sì e, come ho fatto notare a un altro utente qui sotto, se vai a vedere chi sta investendo in Afghanistan per sfruttare queste risorse trovi quasi solo compagnie cinesi. Gli americani sarebbero proprio dei pisquani a spendere trilioni di dollari in guerra per poi lasciare le spoglie al loro principale concorrente economico.

Altra teoria priva di senso. I famosi oledotti Afghani dovrebbero connettere l'Azerbaijan all'India. Sai quale altro paese c'è fra l'Azerbaijan e l'India? il Pakistan. Indovina quale paese è già amicone degli americani e sarebbe prontissimo a dar loro una mano per creare problemi all'India?

&gt; ma non è nemmeno fuori dal mondo pensare che, se non c'è stata un coinvolgimento materiale, cosa probabile appunto perché difficile avere una tale organizzazione quale quella che i complottisti sospettano, c'erano interessi a non prevenire.

No, seriamente: secondo te qualcuno nel governo americano ha saputo che volevano tirare due aerei sulle torri gemelle, uno sul pentagono e uno sul Capitol, con vittime stimate in migliaia di morti, e ha detto ""toh che culo, non facciamo un cazzo così poi possiamo invadere l'Afghanitan?""",0,1379067132,null,0,false,0,cc7h96z,t3_1m980f,t1_cc7h96z,t1_cc7g7za,null,1429479254,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

true,SnorriSturluson,piemonte,,"&gt;Sì e, come ho fatto notare a un altro utente qui sotto, se vai a vedere chi sta investendo in Afghanistan per sfruttare queste risorse trovi quasi solo compagnie cinesi. Gli americani sarebbero proprio dei pisquani a spendere trilioni di dollari in guerra per poi lasciare le spoglie al loro principale concorrente economico.

Ma tu parli come se la guerra in sé non fosse un grande affare per un certo complesso industriale (non dico lobby se no poi si parte ad accusare di credere al NWO), portarla in un paese sfruttabile è un passo logico, poi la % di allocazione degli investimenti lascia il tempo che trova: nel momento in cui si sono rinnovate le commesse statali, in cui si crea questo http://www.trade.gov/afghanistan/ e iniziano le attività estrattive, l'affare si può ritenere concluso. La Cina ha potuto diventare la principale investitrice perché ha avuto a disposizione una grande quantità di capitale anche aiutata dal fatto che l'economia cinese dipende da quella statunitense, mentre quest'ultima ha dovuto affrontare una crisi economica e non può approfittare dello yuan forzosamente mantenuto basso rispetto al dollaro (ovviamente la faccio semplice, mille altri motivi per cui l'economia cinese è più competitiva, a questo punto, ma di certo non hanno fatto la conta per decidere chi investiva e chi ci metteva i soldati).

&gt;Altra teoria priva di senso. I famosi oledotti Afghani dovrebbero connettere l'Azerbaijan all'India. Sai quale altro paese c'è fra l'Azerbaijan e l'India? il Pakistan. Indovina quale paese è già amicone degli americani e sarebbe prontissimo a dar loro una mano per creare problemi all'India?

Non dimentichiamo il Turkmenistan

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Afghanistan_Pipeline 
USA e India sono nemici? Non ho capito la tua affermazione, dato che Pakistan e India sono storicamente nemici l'America (meglio, chi ci guadagnerebbe) non avrebbe interesse a favorire una minima distensione per completare tale infrastruttura?

&gt;No, seriamente: secondo te qualcuno nel governo americano ha saputo che volevano tirare due aerei sulle torri gemelle, uno sul pentagono e uno sul Capitol, con vittime stimate in migliaia di morti, e ha detto ""toh che culo, non facciamo un cazzo così poi possiamo invadere l'Afghanitan?""

Giusto, è più probabile che abbiano direttamente favorito tale azione. Perché non sarebbe la prima volta che viene ignorato un avvertimento o per orgoglio (guerra sottomarina indiscriminata e Lusitania), per chissà cosa (messaggi giapponesi intercettati prima di Pearl Harbor) o vere e proprie false flag operations (USS Maine), da cui si capisce perché i complottisti prosperano così bene.
Ora, un attacco così pirotecnico a dei civili può essere effettivamente considerato eccessivo anche per l'Umbrella Corp., accettiamo il colpo di culo com'è stato il terremoto dell'Aquila per gli appaltatori edili (risate al telefono anyone?), dimmi: a fronte di un'organizzazione prettamente saudita, che solo recentemente si era trasferita in Afghanista con il benestare del regime, come è stata così veloce la decisione d'invadere un paese sovrano (erano 10 anni che non accadeva, escludendo i bombardamenti in Serbia) che aveva ruolo solo logistico?

No. Ti dico no perché queste discussioni seguono sempre lo stesso template: teoria complottista (""gli USA in Afghanistan per le risorse minerarie""), controragionamento (""E allora perché le lasciano ai cinesi?""), complottista tira fuori nuovo argomento (""E che mi dici del complesso militare-industriale?""). No, non ho voglia. Restiamo sul pezzo: USA in Afghanistan per le risorse minerarie e per il controllo degli oledotto e gasdotti, grazie.

&gt; poi la % di allocazione degli investimenti lascia il tempo che trova

Ma proprio no. Se uno scatena una guerra per delle risorse e installa un governo che dipende totalmente dal proprio supporto militare *di sicuro* non lascia le concessioni minerarie *per cui ha scatenato la guerra* al proprio principale concorrente economico.

&gt; La Cina ha potuto diventare la principale investitrice perché ha avuto a disposizione una grande quantità di capitale

Ah, ok. Gli USA hanno organizzato un complotto spietatissimo e una guerra costosissima al solo scopo di mettere le mani sulle ricchezze dell'Afghanistan, ma una volta installato un governo loro amico non hanno avuto il cuore di dirgli ""No, tu le concessioni le dai a noi e riga"". Certo, mi sembra ragionevole.

&gt; Non dimentichiamo il Turkmenistan

Per il Turkeministan vale lo stesso ragionamento, leggi l'articolo che hai postato (e due).

&gt;  USA e India sono nemici?

Sono concorrenti sul piano economico e politico. D'altra parte stiamo parlando di oledotti che dovrebbero arrivare in India, se mi proponi che gli USA abbiano invaso l'Afghanistan per avere il controllo di questi oleodotti l'unica spiegazione è che l'abbiano fatto per avere un punto di pressione nei confronti dell'India, eh?

&gt; Non ho capito la tua affermazione, dato che Pakistan e India sono storicamente nemici l'America (meglio, chi ci guadagnerebbe) non avrebbe interesse a favorire una minima distensione per completare tale infrastruttura?

No? che gliene frega agli USA di aiutare le forniture di petrolio Indiane o di aiutare le compagnie petrolifere in Azerbaijan e nel Mar Caspio (quasi tutte russe) a fare i loro affari? al massimo gli interessa la possibilità di poter bloccare questi progetti per far pressione su questa o quella fazione.

The difference between my typo and your vocabulary is, that I can easily edit my post to correct the mistake while you belligerently cling to your wrong definition.

So what you're saying is, that if I refuse to employ black people, that's not racist. If I refuse to provide health care and education to black people, that's not racist. If I don't let black people vote, that's not racist. If I force black people to sit in the back of the bus, that's not racist.

Your culture is what **you** do. It's not what anyone else does. The big misconceptions here are (1) the patently ridiculous notion that German culture is unchanging or 'has been in place for generations' and (2) that the defining feature of German culture is, that it absolutely can't suffer the existence of minorities. Cultures changes all the time. 

And quite frankly, if the defining features of your culture are xenophobia and a need for total supremacy and oppression of all dissent, the idea that everyone around you has to be exactly like you or else you have to remove him (which is what you do, when you accuse immigrants of forcing your culture onto you merely by existing), then your culture deserves to die.

De Pretto pensava che questa formula desse la forza viva di un corpo di massa m lanciato alla velocità della luce, ma questo non è vero; per un corpo di massa non zero la forza viva tende *all'infinito* man mano che la velocità tende a c, non a mc^2.

Inoltre, è falso (anche se è una falsità molto diffusa) che mc^2 sia dove si nasconde l'energia potenziale nucleare. L'energia liberata dalla fissione nucleare è energia potenziale elettromagnetica dovuta all'interazione protone-protone nel nucleo; l'interazione nucleare forte, a cui è legato il difetto di massa e quindi mc^2, non dà un contributo positivo all'energia emessa dalla fissione.

------------------------

In realtà, prima di Einstein moltissimi fisici avevano azzeccato questo o quel pezzetto di relatività. La relatività speciale va naturalmente a braccetto con l'elettrodinamica (che era stata scoperta prima) ed è stato proprio studiando l'elettrodinamica che si è arrivati, dopo molti tentativi, a formulare la relatività speciale. Einstein ha avuto due meriti fondamentali rispetto ai suoi predecessori (a cui pure senza dubbio si ispirò): costruire una teoria della relatività coerente e completa e individuare i corretti assiomi di relatività, che erano sfuggiti ai suoi colleghi e contengono un contenuto fisico clamorosamente rivoluzionario.

Like i'll do all the arts this year and sports/swimming next year. Does this also apply for the ""important"" subjects? Or can they choose weather they do a specific subject or not?  

I think that's a bad idea toe two reasons. First, no child has an actual plan on what they really need and what is good for them. That is at least until they are 15/16. They have not got the ability and the experience to plan further. That would lead to bad decisions they would regret later on. Second, it makes planning really difficult for the schools. Many schools arround here are rather small. They don't have the capacity (rooms/teachers/budget) to offer individual schedules and the childrens records wouldn't be comparable. That would be the first thing the parents would complain about.  

About the ""What if parents take their kids out of school and teach them wrong things?"" thing: That is a thing i almost excusively hear on reddit. I live in germany and a haven't heared that in real live for decades. Those people are a reall small minority and quiet obviously dipshit crazy. Furthermore, two of the three groups are illegally here anyways. They don't have the right to complan about the issue. For the evolution deniers: If they really feel that this is important they can still teach their belives to their kids at home and let them decide what they want to belive. 

You are right, they will be exposed to their parents opinions at home regardless what they learn at school. The point is: When they have to attend school then they at least also hear the official version of the things and have a chance to decide what to belive. I firmly belive that everybody should have that chance.  

For your last point: It is important for schools to teach children about things their parents don't aree with. Noone else will. It protects the child to teach tehes things. Children would be segregated from society if they weren't taught these things. And in case you stumble upon a fact that is taught in school and you don't agree with you still have the option to take legal measures against the school. Thats a big hurdle, i agree, but it also ensures that parents only complan about things that really bug them.

Premetto: NON sono leghista, NON sono fascista.

Personalmente ci sono rimasto male quando ho scoperto dell'elezione della signora Kyenge. Non perché è di colore, siamo nel 2013 e non c'è spazio per razzismi inutili basati sul colore della pelle.

Ci sono rimasto male perché è stata eletta una persona, al governo *italiano*, che per sua stessa ammissione dice di ""non sentirsi completamente italiana"". E nel giuramento sulla Costituzione vi è il passaggio che recita “Giuro di essere fedele alla Repubblica, di osservarne lealmente la Costituzione e le leggi e di esercitare le mie funzioni nell’interesse esclusivo della nazione”. Parafrasando la polemica tirata in piedi da Magdi [insert religion here] Allam, come fa una persona a giurare fedeltà di svolgere ""l'interesse esclusivo della nazione"" se non se ne sente completamente parte? Di quale delle due nazioni parla?

E qui mi si apre un'altra osservazione: per diventare parte del governo -e quindi dell'amministrazione e rappresentanza dello Stato Italiano e dei suoi abitanti- bisognerebbe essere italiani di *nascita*. Non dovrebbe essere possibile raggiungere le alte sfere del governo di una nazione se non si è nemmeno nati lì. Ma questi sono i miei 2 cent, e mi rendo conto che suona molto leghista, come cosa. Niente di più lontano da quello che intendo, comunque. Non ho nulla contro gli stranieri -quelli ""buoni"", almeno, ma mi riferisco a persone e non a intere etnie- e mi piace la globalizzazione, il mescolamento di diverse culture e la potenziale crescita mutuale che può risultarne, se entrambe sono ben disposte a crescere (cosa che, generalmente, la cultura islamica rifiuta violentemente).

tl;dr: non ce l'ho con la Kyenge perché è nera, ce l'ho con lei perché dice di non sentirsi italiana. E per me i rappresentanti del governo dovrebbero essere tutti italiani di nascita.

EDIT: prego i votanti (positivi e negativi, indifferentemente) di documentare le loro preferenze. Imparate a usarlo sto cazzo di up/downvote. Se avete paura di ritorsioni, fatevi un throwaway.

Personalmente penso che l'elezione di Cecile Kyenge sia un'ottima cosa, anche se credo sia stata fatta per far sembrare il governo attuale ""di sinistra"", e non una coalizione tra sinistra e destra (come in realtà è), e che per questo non riuscirà a fare molto perchè verrà ostacolata.
Il problema del razzismo in italia è un argomento molto importante, e per come l'ho vista io ci sono molte persone che anche se non dicono nulla apertamente non vedono di buon occhio la cosa.
Anche per me è inconcepibile che ci siano così tanti problemi per questo, ma dobbiamo capire che l'italia è uno dei principali luoghi di immigrazione, e che a causa delle nostre leggi poco rispettate alcuni stranieri si sentono liberi di fare cose illegali. Tutta questa faccenda è gonfiata anche dalla stampa, che spesso mette in risalto la nazionalità dei criminali, instillando nella testa delle persone il fatto che la maggior parte dei crimini sia commesso da immigrati (Cosa che non è vera).
Dicendo questo non voglio giustificare le persone che la pensano così, ma spiegare la faccenda.

Ma questo è un argomento da sofisti, che si basa solo sulla confusione fra identità e fedeltà. Giustamente e onestamente, Cecile Kyenge non nega che parte della sua identità è di congolese; questo non significa però che la sua fedeltà vada in parte al Congo. 

Per altro, con lo stesso argomento, si potrebbe contestare la nomina di chiunque: tutti noi abbiamo identità ulteriori e complementari a quella di italiano; per esempio quella di fiorentino, o di milanese, o di europeo, o di cattolico, o di comunista. La difesa dell'interesse della nazione potrebbe richiedere a chiunque di noi di mettere gli interessi dell'Italia davanti a quelli di Firenze, o di Milano, o dell'Europa, o della Chiesa Cattolica, o dell'Internazionale Comunista; ma giustamente, in tutti questi casi, si ritiene che la fedeltà all'Italia andrà verificata nell'azione ministeriale invece che esclusa a priori.

&gt;  per diventare parte del governo -e quindi dell'amministrazione e rappresentanza dello Stato Italiano e dei suoi abitanti- bisognerebbe essere italiani di nascita. Non dovrebbe essere possibile raggiungere le alte sfere del governo di una nazione se non si è nemmeno nati lì.

Non ho mai detto che all'estero fanno meglio di noi, in questo. Anzi. (però pure tu mi hai portato un esempio abbastanza debole...la nazione più frivola degli USA dove ha sede Hollywood, che incorona un attore di film d'azione...forse era meglio se lo lasciavano nel suo paesino in cima alle alpi austriache!)

Capisco questo tuo punto di vista. Però, parlando a titolo personale, se io non mi sentissi completamente parte di una nazione non penserei nemmeno di correre per diventarne governatore (perdonami, non ho trovato un termine migliore).

Concordo anche io. Anche io sono stato molto felice di avere finalmente un ministro di colore, ma mi ha dato fastidio pensare che fosse solo un'operazione di facciata. 

La premessa è questa: quando qui in Italia abbiamo capito che l'esito delle elezioni avrebbe portato ad un governo misto composto dal centro-sinistra e dal centro-destra, tutti siamo rimasti delusi. Nessuno poteva dirsi soddisfatto da un governo del genere.


E quindi Letta e Napolitano hanno tirato fuori questo coniglio dal cappello: l'innovativo ministro di colore nero! E' stata una mossa furba.


Inoltre:

* questo ministro non potrà fare nulla di concreto: il governo è instabile e c'è una componente di centro-destra, quindi non credo che potremo vedere alcuna riforma significativa delle leggi che regolano l'immigrazione (e infatti, per quanto ne so io, non non abbiamo visto ancora nulla di concreto fatto da questo ministro).
* Il ministro dell'integrazione, è un [ministero senza portafogli](http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ministro-e-ministero-diritto-amministrativo/), ovvero non ha alcun budget e non dirige alcun dipartimento. Insomma un ministero di scarsa importanza nel governo. 
* Il ""ministero per l'integrazione"" è un'invezione di questo governo ([quasi](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipartimento_per_la_Cooperazione_internazionale_e_l%27Integrazione)). Quindi non solo il primo ministro di colore, ma anche per la prima volta un ministro dedicato solo all'integrazione.

Eppure, in quanto novità importante ""che fa anche notizia"", nella [foto ufficiale del governo](http://img46.imageshack.us/img46/6621/rzu0.png) compare al centro, come una mascotte o medaglia da sfoggiare con fierezza. L'ho trovato molto triste.

Inoltre, c'è una grande differenza tra un ministro di colore in Italia e, che so... un presidente di colore negli stati uniti. Questo perchè **l'immigrazione in italia è un fenomeno recente**, non ha più di 10-20 anni. Le persone di colore in italia non hanno posizioni di responsabilità non (solo) a causa del razzismo, ma sopratutto perchè quasi tutti gli stranieri di 30-50 anni non sono nati in Italia e ce ne sono pochissimi con una preparazione culturale, linguistica e accademica che permette loro di assumere posizioni di responsabilità (anche perchè se puoi fare il manager, non viene a cercare fortuna in Italia). Abbiamo molti operai, imprenditori e persino medici di origine straniera, come anche qualche persona del mondo dello spettacolo; tuttavia prima di vedere dei veri manager e ministri di origine albanese o africana dobbiamo aspettare che i figli degli stranieri, nati in italia, crescano e studino prima che riescano a conquistarsi posizioni di potere. Insomma c'è da aspettare ancora un decennio prima di vedere ministi e manager di colore qui in Italia. **Per ora in Italia il potere è in mano agli italiani** e, nella sostanza, un gesto simbolico non può cambiare questo fatto sostanziale.

Per ora Il ministro nero è solo un gesto di forte impatto comunicativo, molto importante. Fa capire a tutti che la società sta cambiando. Purtroppo Kyenge non ha nessun vero potere, è solo una mascotte da esibire, che purtroppo non avrà nessun impatto di lungo termine. Anzi mi ha dato fastidio proprio che avessero fatto qualcosa di così importante solo per *marketing*. Chissà, forse un'occasione persa di fare qualcosa di serio.

**tl;dr: il governo rischia di avere una cattiva reputazione, e improvvisamente ecco che compare ""il ministro dell'integrazione nero"": che se lo leggi ad alta voce sembra un banale luogo comune. Ministro che, oltre a degli inutili gesti simbolici, non potrà fare nulla. Fiero di averlo. Dispiaciuto che sia solo uno strumento.**

Una nota: a differenza della lingua inglese, in italiano sia il termine *di colore*, che il termine *nero*, sono *politically correct*. A volte è persino più elegante dire *di colore*, anche se tutti gli africani che ho conosciuto dicono di essere *neri*.

It may be silly/useless or whatever but it's the reality. Stereotypes are silly too but we are still subject to them often enough.

This argument is inane. 

It's not that they just study the history of the region, like white people in the US would study Native American history. What they do is claim they are descended from Ancient Macedonians but not Ancient Greeks. Keeping in mind that Ancient Macedonians self identified as Greeks, does this make any sense to you? Does it sound like studying history or manipulating it?

Cause the reason they are doing it, is that they're placing the ethnogennesis thing on this, and it doesn't make historical or just plain sense. Obviously there might be ""descendants of Alexander"" from Macedonia (that is in N.Greece), to FYROM, to Alexandria, to Antiochia, to Seleucia, or to some remnant of a Greek-Hindu kingdom.

The problem with FYROM is that they are the only ones that claim that Ancient Macedonians aren't Greek. Why? Cause the only reason their goverment bothered to do it is to make them not feel Bulgarian, and admitting greek heritage would be the same ""evil"" they are scared off.

I have already seen multiple posts on reddit from uninformed (usually young ) foreigners being under the impression that Alexander wasn't greek, this is bullshit.

Finally let's not forget that  about 1/4th of Alexander's army were Thracians, that is most likely present day Bulgarians.

di Laura Bogliolo

	
ROMA - Palloncini, bevande e buoni per acquistare un Happy Meal. Il tutto adagiato su un piccolo banco posizionato all'interno di un corridoio mentre campeggia il marchio McDonald's. «Prego bambini, è per voi» sussurra un voce gentile. Occhi spalancati dei piccolini, mentre le mamme fanno una smorfia.

Perché il banchetto a base di prodotti McDonald's è apparso ieri all'interno di una scuola materna, un modo, qualcuno avrà pensato, per non traumatizzare i bambini per il distacco da mamma e papà. Il trauma, invece, c'è stato perché i genitori non sono riusciti proprio a comprendere il perché di quell'iniziativa che ha scosso la Scuola dell'Infanzia Cittadino del Mondo, in via San Pantaleo Campano, nel quartiere Trullo.

«Ciò che ha imparato mio figlio nel primo giorno di inserimento alla materna! Grazie Ignazio Marino, ne avevamo bisogno» tuona Valentina che sul suo profilo Twitter @baruda posta le foto di un poco tranquillo primo giorno di scuola tra bevande e palloncini McDonald’s. «Son rimasta sconvolta – racconta Valentina – i prodotti McDonald's erano stati allestiti all'interno del corridoio della scuola, sono stati distribuiti anche buoni per acquistare Happy Meal», un particolare menù per bambini.

«Mio figlio frequenta una scuola comunale – aggiunge la mamma indignata – mi aspettavo insegnamenti sull'alimentazione e non uno spot pubblicitario dentro l'istituto. Siamo impazziti?». La polemica è esplosa su Twitter con l’hashtag occupymcdonalds. Sdegno da parte di altri utenti e il tam tam è arrivato fino al sindaco Ignazio Marino che ha risposto: «Ci mobiliteremo con l'assessorato alla Scuola, ovviamente non è un'iniziativa del Comune».

LA REPLICA
E McDonald's che dice? «Abbiamo servito tè freddo e distribuito palloncini a titolo gratuito – spiega Tommaso Valle, responsabile comunicazione McDonald's - si è trattato di una cortesia, non di un’operazione di marketing: siamo stati contattati da un'insegnante della scuola, esprimiamo rammarico per aver suscitato perplessità in alcuni genitori».

In order to prove your point you said that Greeks are overtaxed but your evidence was not really conclusive. I just pointed this out. If your point was that certain segments of the Greek economy are overtaxed, as you indicate in your last paragraph, then, if true, this does not imply that you need to cut public expenses; you could just re-distribute the tax burden and keep the same revenue. 

In conclusion, your point was about public expenditure. You have not demonstrated that decreasing public expenditure (laying off public servants in particular) makes the economy so much healthier healthier that it would save hundreds of thousands of jobs. 

As for my alternate proposal, that's a different discussion altogether. I have two possible resolutions in my mind: One is for some EU/Eurozone programme that allows Greece's economy to not be in direct competition with the much stronger economies of the Eurozone (e.g. fiscal transfers, surplus recycling and so on).

Most Greek people do not give a shit about this name controversy, for the majority of even ultra-nationalist the only thing they ask is for a compromise so that both Greek MAcedonia and FYROM is recognized.

Something like North Macedonia, so there can be a clear distinction between Greek Macedonia and the Slavic Macedonia Region. 

Also reading your other posts i have to comment on a few things.

First FYROM was NEVER part of the historical Makedon Kingdom, as you can see in this map http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg

FYROM was part of the ""dependent"" territories, the people who lived in these lands were Thracian tribesmen. The modern residents of FYROM appeared during the Ottoman Wars, they were refugees from the Bulgaria-Ottoman War and that is why the FYROM language is nearly 99% identical to Bulgarian language, they are the same exact people.

After Alexanders death, the Kingdom of Makedon quickly declined but they still maintained a power-base in Thessaloniki . . for hundreds of years the descendants of Alexander were royalty and aristocrats, often marrying the Roman elite during the Byzantine Kingdom Era. To think that the Slavic people of Fyrom think they have any connection to these people is pure insanity and delusion. 

Between the Early Ottoman Times up until the early 20th century the area now known as ""Macedonia"" was called Vardaska with the capital of Skopje.

The main reason why these people think they have any connection to the Greek Macedonians is during the Soviet rule of their country . .the SOviets had a MAster plan to take over the Thessaloniki Region so they could build their first Mediterranean base(major strategic naval base)

For this plan to work they had to convince a bunch of ethnic Bulgarians and Albanians that they were descendants of Alexander and that they had territorial claims to Thessaloniki. So they spent over a decade brain-washing them in what is likely the biggest Psy-Ops operation in all of history. 

The Soviets never pulled off this plan, but I can see now that it was actually a brilliant strategy and it would have easily worked if the Soviets were still around to this day.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;You this but why is less regulations such as bad thing? 

Because the regulations that are getting passed are going through an army of lobbyists camped in Brussels and they predominantly favour large businesses that support the legal costs and can capitalise on initiatives and its adding extra pressure to SMEs which are actually, collectively, the largest employers and the most efficient way to build an economy.

Nobody is arguing for removing all regulations but it remains that we constantly make compromises or get outvoted in Europe and if we did want to make a change then we could do it in Westminster.

Added to that exports account for 20% of UK GDP, of that if we take the most ambitious of figures and add a bit and say that the EU represents 10% of UK GDP, then that doesn't mean we will lose it, but it does mean for 10% of GDP we have to enact 100% of regulation across the whole economy.  Through EFTA, if we only had to enact 30% of regulation on 10% of the economy, then that gives a HUGE competitive edge.  The sort of competitive edge that the likes of Spain, Portugal and Greece have been crying out for.  

You can still have regulations.  You can even still adopt EU regulations wholesale if they make sense, but you have the choice and the options available.  That gives you stability and that brings investment.

&gt; I trust the EU more to make our regulations than a government who wants to make us U.S#2

However bad you think the UK government is, it's only because Brussels gets nowhere near the coverage that you don't see them in the same light.  The EU is where senior politicians and commissioners are appointed after they've lost or become an embarassment at home.  Barroso was one of four at the Azores conference where Bush and Blair made their plans for war.  They're both considered toxic in their respective countries, and Barroso left his office in Portugal just before his party took a crushing defeat on his mismanagement of the economy.  Unaccountability in the EU is far more systemic.  Only today Rompuy has [criticised auditors, telling them to tone down criticism](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10306461/EU-auditors-must-tone-down-criticism-of-Brussels-spending-says-Herman-Van-Rompuy.html).

Nobody is trying to make us a US Mk2.

&gt;Furthermore in E.U we have more of a say on global affairs by being apart of such a massive organisation

Really?  Because if I recall the last month correctly it was a nation state, something that the federalists want to get rid off, that actually sent a seismic shift across the world.  We'd have far more say and influence free to speak our minds.  

&gt;you talk about it not effecting trade but I wonder which would better if we had a trade problem with another country say China, 

China who Europe is constantly taking us to the brink of trade war when countries like Switzerland and Iceland and well into free trade talks?   It would be far easier negotiating free trade bilaterally than having to run it past 27 other countries first none of whose economies are indicative of our own.  

Plus the EU still has big trade tariffs going back to the customs group.  Elsewhere global tariffs have come down.  They still have ~10% on most of the world when everybody else is around 2-3%

&gt; I'm pretty sure having the E.U bringing this issue up rather than just the U.K would hold alot more weight and that goes for all trade deals signed with other countrys.

Then you'd be demonstrably wrong because you only have to see what the EFTA countries are doing, or what their trade tariffs are.

When a certain race commits a disproportionate amount of crimes in a European city, its a statistic and evidence of their faulty subculture. In the US, its evidence of racism and discrimination by a tyrannical white majority (which in many places isnt a majority, and in a few years wont be nationwide). At least that is the double standard I have seen countless times.

Almost every thread on Gypsies I will hear how awful they are and how ""nobody has ever had a good experience with Gypsies."" Then I will almost always read about good experiences people have had with Gypsies that lead normal lives. These experiences are burred compared to the hateful comments on Gypsies. 

Upon meeting Europeans traveling I have countless stories that surprised me. I met a German doctor that told me he has nothing against Jews, they just should not be allowed to live in New York or London. I met a Swede that told me ""Muslims [were] ruining his country and all of Europe"". 

I met a Dutch guy who wanted to hold me personally accountable for ""segregation in US cities"". That same night he got drunk and told me he ""likes everyone except Pakistanis"", and ""the only good Paki is a dead Paki."" He got a job working for a Chicago consulting firm's Dutch office so he comes to Chicago for training every couple years. He was here in June and saw a black guy that looked a little ghetto driving a new M6 and said ""how the fuck can he afford that, must be doing something illegal.""

The vast majority of Europeans I have met have been great. But dont ignore the fact a lot of racism/xenophobia still exists in Europe.

edit: also, teaching kids to swim is a good thing, but then? should we wait our turn, swim laps, take the time, giving a B+ to lisa simpson because she sucks at sports? should we really force a fat girl to walk around in a bright pink one piece suit if she is not comfortable, or a religious girl to swim with males? what's the point? building a shared national identity based on swimming? recruiting the ones good ad sport so we can beat te URRS at medal count?

The Foederati were not given Roman Citizenship, they were given land to settle on in exchange for military service. Why did the Western Empire resort to such crude methods of raising armies?

Myself? C++, mostly. Couple of tasks I did for classes used it, and it stuck with me. Overall, we used a lot of Java for general algorithmics, C/C++ for system programming and continuous algorithmics, also some excursions eg. into Haskell for parts of concurrency, Prolog for logic and VHDL for engineering.

&gt;Were you aware that Rome reached its territorial apex during the reign of Emperor Trajan, a full hundred years before the Edict of Caracalla?

I am well aware of that. However Trajan's campaign of conquering Mesopotamia was a mistake since it started, so although he conquered it, it was fairly obvious that these were lost lands. The real decline of Rome truly started. He ruled as a tyrant. After him he might of Rome started disappearing, Constantine brought it for a while just before Roe's crumble.

&gt;Julius Nepos was murdered by a member of his own personal guard.

That is irrelevant. So were many Roman emperors. But after them a new Emperor would rule. The ""citizens"" though made sure there wouldn't be another Emperor after that one. For the sake of truth the last Roman Emperor didn't even get killed because he was a child. But Rome was ended by the very same barbarians who got citizenship in the Empire. Then the Germanic barbarian Odoacer, not only ended Rome but proclaimed himself king of Italy and brought all of his barbarian brothers to Italy. 

And not only did the barbarians destroy Rome. No. They also brought to Europe what? Right, the Dark ages.",0,1379098353,null,0,false,0,cc7pytk,t3_1masvz,t1_cc7pytk,t1_cc7pluh,null,1429475119,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

To be fair, this is more or less a remnant of days long gone; I’m glad to say that religion has very little significance for most people. Still, we’re far from “officially” being a secular state when “God” is integrated in (some of*) our laws like that.
