But what I also don't have is any sense of connection to citizens of other European countries aside from geography and that lack of connection is shared by a majority of my generation (30-40). Polls would suggest that younger generations feel differently.

As I have said before on this forum. If the rest of the EU wants the UK to join in fully with integration then economic arguments are not going to be sufficient. Economic benefits can be realised through a common market without the rest of the EU machinery. If, as appears to be the case, the goal is a federal Europe then the EU is going to have to create some feeling of solidarity. It's going to have to generate the sentiment of being a European citizen thereby creating a sense of connection to other European citizens. Right now, certainly amongst my own circle of contacts, that feeling is non-existent.

I firmly believe this lies at the heart of the UK's rocky relationship with the EU. There are economic benefits, there are benefits in things like workers rights and human rights but in no way do I view myself as an EU citizen. As such everything related to the EU gives the impression of a foreign power imposing its will on my country. In a very real sense it has the same feeling as being a member of a annexed nation bound to the will of their conquerors.

In the old USSR did the citizens of Lithuania care about the citizens of Georgia? Were they resentful at the overbearing influence of Russia? I'm not remotely suggesting the EU is the same as the USSR but I'm trying to illustrate the sentiment it generates. If there's no feeling of communality, if we can't view the people of Germany, or France, or Greece etc. as fellow citizens then the UK will never have a contented relationship with the EU because we will always have the nagging feeling we should be fighting for our ""independence"".",0,1359317033,null,0,false,0,c84kety,t3_17da2k,t1_c84kety,t1_c84jq1a,null,1431098494,-4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-4

This is just one example.  The problems with the ECJ don't stop there.  The German Federal Constitutional Court has had to intervene.  It's not just a UK criticism.  The ECJ tried to stop a German law put in place to make older people close to retirement more attractive as a prospect employee.  ECJ PC do-goodery with no understanding of sovereign decisions, or why they'd been taken, struck again.

The Austrian chancellor had a problem with the ECJ:

                  Mr Schussel said ""the ECJ…has in the last couple of years systematically 
                  expanded European competencies, even in areas, where there is decidedly 
                  no [European] community law. ""Suddenly, judgements emerge on the role 
                  of women in the German federal army, or on access of foreign students to 
                  Austrian universities – that is clearly national law"", he added.

                  The chancellor referred to a judgement by the EU court of last July, when 
                  judges ruled that Austria could not restrict access of foreign students to 
                  its universities.

As [this official website](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/financialreport/annexes/annex3/index_en.html) states:

&gt;The operating budgetary balance of each Member State is established by calculating the difference between:

&gt;* the operating expenditure (i.e. excluding administration) allocated to each Member State, and

&gt;* the adjusted ‘national contribution’ of each Member State.

As an example, they compute the budgetary balance for Belgium. There, they get the following result: A budget balance of -1.369 bn€. 
In other words, according to the European Unions own computations, money LEAVES Belgium and ENTERS the European Union

A serious discrepancy between what one would deduce from this chart and what the European Union itself thinks. The same holds for 'big receiver Luxembourg'.

As the above website notes, this is mainly because of this decision:
&gt;In accordance with point 75 of the conclusions of the 1999 European Council in Berlin, ‘When referring to budgetary imbalances, the Commission, for presentational purposes, will base itself on operating expenditure’.

Meanwhile, this data seems to reflect the decision not to account for the UK rebates when calculating official budgetary balance numbers. (Although, to be fair, it is mentioned quite prominently in the center, so people could piece it together. It's one of the few charts passing recently to actually feature it graphically). It's all or nothing, not pick and choose.

The official numbers according to the European Union can be found [here.](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/financialreport/wel/images/financialreport/en/annex3_1_en.png)
Belgium and luxembourg jump from big receivers to, at least percentage wise, the top contributers.

That is indeed how Malaysian Sharia is implemented, more or less. Non-Muslims buy and consume alcohol relatively freely, for instance, while Muslims are under penalty if they do.

&gt; the sharia police decide who is muslim and who isn't in these regions, which means if you aren't muslim you have to stay away from sharia ruled areas of those countries if you don't want to have to obey sharia

No. You really clearly don't know what you're talking about here. In Malaysia, for example, you're required to prove that you're Muslim (if you're a foreigner, that's relatively complicated, as a converted Muslim friend of mine discovered when he got married to his wife), and citizens are officially registered under each religion. This is because being Muslim also comes with certain rights under Sharia (i.e. non-Muslims cannot own land, and a range of other issues). Of course it is strictly forbidden to forsake Islam, which is, again, one of the many serious problems with Sharia.

There are far more male drivers in that age group.  When companies calculated a weighted medium the male driver policies came down only fractionally.  The female policies shot up in comparison.  Then there were the companies that specifically targeted the lower risk female drivers: it destroyed their business models!

Spin?

I've not even touched the meaty stuff yet, why would I spin car insurance?    
If I were to be tempted to 'spin' anything it would be the French hamster ruling, if only for comedic effect...

*Nobody* needs to spin *anything* when they know what they did to employers last year.

-----------------

**The Meat:**

The ECJ told employers that if their employee gets sick on paid vacation time it was not the private insurance or travel policy but the EMPLOYER's job to compensate them.  Paid vacation is one thing.  Paid vacation and then paying them again if they had a bad experience when on holiday: it's madness.  It's widely open to corruption and being taken advantage of.  A company has to work around to make sure they can provide them the relevant time off, pay them paid holiday leave, and rightly so, even sick leave, but then be hit for another bill or extra time off because they were sick when they weren't supposed to be in work, and now they want a second holiday?!  It's economic disaster in the making, especially for the little guy.



That's the meaty argument.  The ECJ driving a stake into small and medium sized businesses and employment figures.  A ruling made by a judge with no knowledge of existing UK sovereign law.  

And people wonder why there are those that shake their heads and say to themselves, 'This simply isn't sustainable.  It might be a moving vehicle but we may *have to* bail'.

You thought I was kidding about the hamster....

**Le Hamster Francaise, le bureaucracy, et l'ECJ:**

                 ""last year, in a suit filed by the Commission, 
                  the ECJ ordered the French government to 
                  protect the rapidly vanishing Cricetus 
                  cricetus—commonly known as the European, 
                  or black-bellied, hamster.""

That's the level of bureaucracy they're reaching.  The French can't decide what's right for their own hamsters now?  A supranational court has to adjudicate?  Why is a European Court wasting its time on these things?  Why is the Commission??  I'm absolutely certain the French could have handled this one on their own without the Commission taking it to the European Court of Justice.  Forget that the ECJ also let off the Chinese from EU environmental fines for dumping industrial herbicide because other European farmers use it, they're too busy looking after French rodents.  Imagine being in a legal bottleneck which is holding back your business and you're behind Hamster-gate, or trademark of the Lindt Tin Foil Wrapped Easter Bunny.  Rulings are currently being delayed up to 18 months before they're processed!  Companies can't sustain that.    It's getting worse too:

                  Union is reflected in their sizable caseload. Last year, 
                  the ECJ completed six hundred and thirty-eight cases, 
                  its largest number to date and twelve percent more 
                  than in 2007; but it has a backlog of eight hundred and
                  forty-nine cases pending, or fifteen percent more than 
                  four years earlier.""

If you watch Terry Gilliam's satirical dystopia *Brazil* this is how Robert De Niro's character, Tuttle, meets his end.  In a maelstrom of paperwork.  The ECJ has become a behemoth.

**Patent Law**

Stem cell research?  Can research it in the EU.  Can't patent it.  Everywhere else can patent it.  Everywhere else can patent the processes the EU might develop and then charge us to use it.  Another ECJ ruling.  So now people are faced with having to patent overseas, where do you think the taxes for these registering subsidiaries is going to go?

The ECJ has come into criticism from all sides; for the record, the UK is one of the least affected with the amongst the fewest cases against them.  How others are putting up with it, I don't know.  By rights they should be as mad as half of the British already are...if they were to know more about it.

&gt;I could keep ranting all day because people like you really piss me off. You especially because you think you're being persuasive but...

I'm not trying to persuade you.  I'm showing how you're wrong, how even those that are pro-EU and at the heart of the establish lament over the ECJ and why; what it is, and what it is becoming.  I'm trying to provide an in-depth argument and list of sources for those might wish to reference these arguments later on and to build on, myself included, which they're more than welcome to.  These same arguments are going to crop up time and time again, and it's going to be a ongoing working rebuttal.

&gt;Cutting myself off there, I'm done. Fuck you.

Erudite.

I don't need to spin or make things up; there are more than enough PRO-EU politicians lining up to criticise the ECJ.

&gt; This is, not to mince words, just insane. Europe has had several years of experience with harsh austerity programs, and the results are exactly what students of history told you would happen: such programs push depressed economies even deeper into depression. And because investors look at the state of a nation’s economy when assessing its ability to repay debt, austerity programs haven’t even worked as a way to reduce borrowing costs.


&gt; What is the alternative? Well, in the 1930s — an era that modern Europe is starting to replicate in ever more faithful detail — the essential condition for recovery was exit from the gold standard. The equivalent move now would be exit from the euro, and restoration of national currencies.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Look at Spain's economy right now. What private sector company will want to set up shop there when the economy is already in the toilet?

The economy is in the toilet precisely because of that, because of the government restricting it. Remove those restrictions and people will benefit from investing in it again.

&gt;I think economist Paul Krugman says it best

Just like [when he said 9/11 was a good thing for the economy](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/14/opinion/reckonings-after-the-horror.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm)?

Oh well, I'll read the nonsense he came up with this time.

&gt;When the bubble burst, the Spanish economy was left high and dry; Spain’s fiscal problems are a consequence of its depression, not its cause.

He's completely ignoring the restrictions and the regulation which proved catastrophic back in 2008. Weren't these in place, Spain would now be in a situation similar to that of many other countries and not with a &gt;25% unemployment rate.

&gt;Nonetheless, the prescription coming from Berlin and Frankfurt is, you guessed it, even more fiscal austerity.

He's right in that this is a bad time to implement austerity yet what alternative does he have? That the government should spend the money it doesn't have and that the future generations should be the ones paying the bills?

The main problem with Spain is the unemployment, to improve on that and on a long term basis, it's not with increased government spending and debt, it's with removing restrictions in the economy.

&gt;This is, not to mince words, just insane. Europe has had several years of experience with harsh austerity programs, and the results are exactly what students of history told you would happen: such programs push depressed economies even deeper into depression.

Europe has also had several years of experience with unbalanced public budgets and the results are exactly what students of history and economics told you would happen (look at what's happening here in Portugal right now): such programs push healthy economies into depression and without capacity of funding themselves.

&gt;And because investors look at the state of a nation’s economy when assessing its ability to repay debt, austerity programs haven’t even worked as a way to reduce borrowing costs.

Except that interest rates went down so no.

&gt;What is the alternative? Well, in the 1930s — an era that modern Europe is starting to replicate in ever more faithful detail — the essential condition for recovery was exit from the gold standard.

He's comparing the Great Depression which was caused by a contraction in the money supply with the current European sovereign-debt crisis which was caused by, well, public debt? Really?

They say generals always fight the last war, and this exactly the same thing, he's trying to use the cure for completely different problems.

&gt;The equivalent move now would be exit from the euro, and restoration of national currencies.

So the EU would break up and we'd all devalue massively to pay for this shit? Not really, no, what we need to do is solve the problem causing it and not the symptoms.

He's very considerate when he tries to undermine the EU and make it weaker when compared to the USA but we don't need his snake oil.

&gt;You may say that this is inconceivable, and it would indeed be a hugely disruptive event both economically and politically.

We do say this.

&gt;But continuing on the present course, imposing ever-harsher austerity on countries that are already suffering Depression-era unemployment, is what’s truly inconceivable.

The thing is that austerity isn't an end in itself but the path to a balanced public budget and a reduced government intervention in the economy, which was the root of all these problems.

What's inconceivable is how Krugman would not see past this and would argue as if it was and as if the problem now was the problem of the Great Depression.",0,1359366258,null,0,false,0,c84xg0k,t3_17dkac,t1_c84xg0k,t1_c84p4yv,null,1431105768,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3

Another example for gov't intervention would be oyster fishing. Back in the early 20th century oysters were a pretty big staple foodstuff for both the UK and France, they were being pretty heavily overfished and govt. reports in both countries warned of a looming crisis. France introduced regulation to cap fishing and allow the population to recover and the UK let fishing continue unhindered citing each oyster producing millions of spawn.

Sometimes? Protectionism always works. The problem is that it works for the national producers and against the consumers!

&gt;The UK let their's go bust whilst Germany supported theirs with protectionist policies - which country produces more cars today do you think?

That doesn't mean the Germans benefited from it, after all, it was all at their expense.

&gt;Back in the early 20th century oysters were a pretty big staple foodstuff for both the UK and France, they were being pretty heavily overfished and govt. reports in both countries warned of a looming crisis. France introduced regulation to cap fishing and allow the population to recover and the UK let fishing continue unhindered citing each oyster producing millions of spawn. Oysters are now a delicacy in the UK, but are still a staple in many French kitchens. 

That's different, that's environmental protection. That's not protecting national producers, that's ensuring sustainability.

&gt;To be fair, it works best in a ""weathering the storm"" sort of application when it's protecting the market from a dip in demand, waiting for it to recover.

The problem is that the market doesn't need protection, the ones that want protection are the producers at the expense of the consumers. If there's a dip in demand, then the suppliers have to either improve their product or move to some other business, never to engage in protectionism and continue doing business while being highly uncompetitive as their subsidised or the government doesn't allow foreign goods in.

&gt;The CAP seems to be more about keeping Europe's ability to make it's own food. 

We more than overproduce, it's what, 30% to 50% of our food going to waste?

Besides, food is plentiful and anyone can supply it, there's no monopoly on it, if we're not competitive on agricultural, we're competitive on other areas, we should try and benefit the most of our comparative advantages, not out of sectors that need governmental action to thrive.

&gt;Without it, a lot of farmers would go bust, land prices would tank and we'd either see farming the realm of large corporations/conglomerates or see massive expansion in building work as the cheap land got gobbled up to make cheap housing.

Nothing of the sort would happen just like it didn't happen when you abolished the Corn laws.

Because you're comparing a monopoly on oil with food production which can be produced everywhere in the world including domestically.

&gt; Wait, have you actually checked it is institutional racism or they have actual mental issues? Such as attention deficit?

Unless the 2/3 of the overall population is also learning disabled in some way, I see no reason to suppose that labeling two third of the non-white kids as learning disabled is in any way anything other than an abuse of authority on the part of the Czech school system. In fact, the most common reason they give that label is because most Roma in Prague are originally from Slovakia and speak Slovak (apparently). The kids are interviewed at age 6 and again at age 8. If one or two Slovak words come out... **bam** ""learning disabled"". White Slovak children do not have to deal with this however. 

&gt; Have you not noticed it is not about skin color but two entirely different ethnic cultures living side by side and mutual bad feelings,

That is no reason for a school system to refuse to educate children. Like I said, even in the American south of 100 years ago.. the state would not refuse to do that (cultural differences were claimed then too). That is also no reason to force people to re-enact the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw. 

&gt; Have you managed to actually talk to people of the street

Sure. But, because I also have brown skin I was consistently mistreated and harassed by almost every Czech person I encountered on the street. For a year. Same happened to most of the other non-white students at my university (UK-born Indians who were there studying medicine, mostly)  Ultimately, I ended up making a few local friends...most of them turned out to be Slovaks... who for some reason were really much nicer to me than the Czechs. 

&gt; has nothing to do with skin color

Who are you trying to fool? Let me guess, you are an over-privileged white guy who has never been confronted by skin-heads. right?

&gt; not shared by anyone who actually see how the average folk and the Roma in EE do not see each other as members of the same group, ethnicity, nation, club, anything that citizenship actually symbolizes

I don't exactly know what you mean... but citizenship is actually a legal concept derived from Ancient Greece. It is supposed to mean that a person is entitled to the protections that the state affords... for example police protection. The point is that the Czech republic is supposed to have some minimal obligation to at least treat them as they would whites. Apparently the concept has yet to be discoved in some parts of Eastern Europe.

""Elite Liberal"" ? what's that? a liberal-thinking Green-Beret Delta force commando? Look, you can call me and my classmates, and professors ""elite liberal"" all day if you want, but it doesn't really have any meaning for this discussion. Now does it?

&gt; how comes that after you had first-hand experience you did not manage to overcome these biases

Because Czech people tried to run me over with their cars while callng me ""chernok"", just for being non-white...

Because some of my classmates got beaten up by skin-heads. They tried to confront me also. 

Because I saw the Czech state treating their own citizens in a way which has not existed in the US for around 50 years.... and whats worse... carry themselves as if it were the correct thing to do. 

That's why.  So please, if intend to pretend that people do not get mistreated in Czech republic because of the color of their skin..and yet.. you think that *I am the one that has the bias*. Well...

However the citizenship thing, this is something you need to understand deeper. The logic of it is that first there has to be an emotional feeling of togetherness, in-groupness, to borrow the American example a ""we the people"" feeling, and then citizenship actually means something. But very often the situation in EE is that people who do not consider themselves the same nation, same ethnic group, historically happens so that they get the same passport. In such cases it is a worthless piece of paper. 

The point I am trying to explain: the way for a normal nation to work is not simply to care about others because they have the same passport. A passport never creates such emotions. Rather a normal nation has such a history that people who already belong together and feel for each other get the same passport. So it is never really the passport that causes the caring in the long run. Important: in the long run. For a few decades it may work.

That's a nice opinion. Shame the law disagrees with you. Countries who participate in inter-EU lending must partial accept liability for the banks which are HQ'd in their country, that's simply a part of conforming to EU law.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Is the money for university for free or do you have to pay it back?

No, if you get (roughly) 8000 SEK/month, 2000 is an ""allowance"", the rest is a loan. You will have to pay back the whole amount of the loan (or possibly not after you are 60/65 or something similar). Also, every semester you have to pass 75 % of your exams.You have to start paying it back as soon as it is finished, however, it is easier to get a respite than from a normal bank loan. 

We have to different sorts of unemployed, those who live on unemployment benefits, and those who live on social welfare. Those on welfare have never worked/ haven't worked for a long time/been thrown out of the system, so they live on welfare. The ""demands"" there are fairly minimal, basically non existant. 

Most people who has (and stays) on welfare are hardly particularely educated, or if they are, they have some sort of issue (drugs, pain, mental etc).  Of course one hardly has to go to university to get a good job, a lot of people have no formal education and are doing very well. However, I suspect most of those people have a certain drive, that I think many of Sweden's welfare recipients lack. Why should they work?  They get food on the table, rent, health care and apparently enough benefits so they can spend 1000 SEK/month on cigarettes. If they worked, they would probably start out with a simple job, not make that much more in the beginning, so why should they work? 

I also suspect that in any population, anywhere, 20-30 % are always lazy idiots, at least if you allow them to be. We do. 


If you are talking about those living on unemployment benefits, that is a bit different, and it wasn't referred to in this program. They have much stricter guidelines as well. They have to apply to X number of jobs/month, be prepared to move everywhere within Sweden etc. I am sure things could be improved, both by the unemployed, and by the unemployment agency, but personally I do not hate on that half as much as I do on people living on welfare. 

I don't know how much a welfare reipient recieves in Germany, but after rent here a single adult have 3000 SEK (there a lists published for every year), farly decent amount in my mind. Of course, that is for food, clothes, electricity, phone, but you can still survive on it. Remember, you do not do anything, at all.  And - like the mother I referred to, you get more if you have kids, at least 1000 SEK/child, probably more. So, no, I really don't feel sorry for people living on welfare, and I question very much where my money is going.

My own experiences in Hungary were of a completely flavor. I've visited both B-pest and Gyor. I also used to like in Hungarian-slovakia as an English teacher..... which apparently bought me a lot of credibility. (also, I can say ""boz-mag"" a lot.. which apparently makes me sound cool).

I have to say that most people in Hungary were friendly/outgoing (as much as people in major cities CAN be friendly that is). Though, for some reason, everyone kept expecting that I could speak German. :/

&gt; emotional feeling of togetherness

Well... I've read that this is sort of a recent feeling. Before the 19th century.. it wasn't that big of a deal.... or so everyone writes. I mean... Austria-Hungary stood for centuries before it fell. right? The swiss *still* don't have this feeling. 

&gt; A passport never creates such emotions.

I would hope that the state does its duty w/o getting too emotional about it. I normally expect the police, the tax man, and the schools/universities and such to be neutral and objective about what they do. 

&gt;  But ultimately every welfare state fails if it is not based on a population that feels strongly connected, strongly ingroup.

I can think of a few counter-examples. New York for example... essentially has no in-group. The diversity is so thick that no five people you pass on the street will be from the same country. This also means that there will not be two police officers from the same ethnicity either. The result is that there is no ""us and them"" sort of feeling. The only thing that people need to survive in that city is enough flexibility not to be hostile towards other people's cultures (you basically have to see them for the content of their character).. and to be tough enough be able to stand your ground. 

but.. in history many great metropli have been like that. London is supposedly also like that. Historically, so were both Rome and Carthage. In the Renascence era... the Netherlands was like that (they also made Manhattan like that via a treaty with the British). In the 1700's, the US was like that. What all these places have in common of course that they all became great centers of wealth and power in human history.

&gt;Because you're comparing a monopoly on oil with food production which can be produced everywhere in the world including domestically.

It takes a year minimum to ramp up production... see other reply

&gt;one can't embargo it when everybody is a potential supplier and when the demand can be met internally.

Food is a higly inelastic commodity. Even small shortage will cause large price spikes. Demand can be met internally only because we have the CAP; without, the land would be sold to build vacation homes.

&gt;And that supply only dwindled when there were wars. Now we have much more improved production techniques and are under no threat whatsoever of war or embargo or anything of the sort that could threaten us.

Yeah, and the Titanic can't sink because they had the newest techniques.

&gt;If that's were case, then it would be wise to have it. However it isn't the case, as we are not under any sort of threat.

However, that has been a huge relif for example for people who want their partner to be able to adopt their child, or just a gay person who for example (it was a case in Sweden) wanted to adopt and care for his dead sisters children.

That doesn't stop gay people from being parents however. For example, surrogate mothers, sperm donations, or just male homosexual couple teaming up with lesbian couple, producing babies. And, as far as everyone knows, these kids are just as happy, or unhappy, as normal kids, because that is what they are - normal.

German, French and UK banks paying back early is great, but the economic  crisis wasn't created by these institutions.  Some of them may have been complicit in part, but they didn't create it.  So has the economic baby of tribulation been delivered yet, or are all the causes still there?

In the last few days we've seen evidence from Portugal that people are beginning to migrate away.  Recently the Greek resolution time-frame has been put back another less ambitious and committed 2 years, which provoked the managing Director of the IMF to groan and visibly roll her eyes whilst sat at the head table when the President of Eurogroup disclosed it, later surfacing that this would mean Greece would need to find an additional €31.5 billion to what they already owe, which they don't have.  Only this month the stepping down President of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Junker, warned the Euro exchange was ""dangerously high"".

""Dangerously high"" means the contractions that marked the start of the crisis, struggling south European economies, are in for a fresh wave of contractions!

Remember, Jean-Claude Juncker famously once informed us that in the world of finance, 

             ""When things become serious, you have to lie."" 

So the lesson is to take city banker insiders with a pinch of salt.  The cause of the crisis has not been dealt with.  Europe's still in labour.

true,ThePhlogist,ENGL,England,"Being a law student I should probably take moment to understand this. As far as I understand it the UK and Netherlands' governments paid the lost deposits of their citizens instead of the Icelandic government which had not excluded it's liability for the remuneration of those deposits and was technically therefore liable for them under the directive it had incorporated. The UK was trying to recoup this money and tried to ensure it got its money by (over-reacting and) freezing Icelandic assets. Iceland's argument is that it couldn't compensate because of the financial crisis and that the directive does not actually impose an obligation on the state but simply that money must be available and Iceland contends it can come from the bank instead of the state. They say that this was the only realistic option because of 'huge costs for the State, moral hazard on the part of the banks, and a linkage 
between the liabilities of the banks and the financial exposure of the State'. 

The judges effectively say that Iceland was free to do with the directive what it willed provided the money to refund depositors was  available from somewhere and that as Preamble 24 of the directive says, the 'Directive may not result in the Member States’ or their competent authorities being made liable in respect of depositors if they have ensured that one or more schemes guaranteeing deposits or credit institutions...have been introduced and officially recognized'. Iceland did that by making the bank pay people back so it's not liable. 

Seems like the right decision and its certainly a yoke off Iceland's back but I wouldn't agree with those in /r/worldnews and say the money the UK sought was not *prima facie* legally available to them. The argument in the case was merely whether Iceland breached the directive which they did not. The moral argument is merely who should bare the risk of not being paid back by Landsbanki's estate, Iceland or the UK. I'm not sure there is a clear cut answer there and besides it wasn't really addressed in the case.

For example, the word ""derby"" enters the language. After a while, the Academy accepts it as a valid word, but with a foreign spelling. Then through 'misuse', both ""derby"" and the Romanianized ""derbi"" become valid forms. After a while, ""derbi"" just becomes more popular, as there is no more need to remember the weird foreign spelling, so the Academy says that the 'Romanianized' version is (native) enough, and we don't need the old one anymore.

There is not much linguistic purism, when compared to French. Sure, some people decry the invasion of English, but most people don't bother with the fact that our language becomes ""impure"".

J'ai pas regardé les motivations profondes de ce conflit qui vu de loin a l'air particulièrement idiot (surtout quand on est athée). Comme à beaucoup d'endroits, la religion semble n'être qu'un moyen de créer une ligne de démarcation entre deux populations qui ont des habitudes et des cultures un peu différentes. Les valeurs chrétiennes sont aceptées des deux cotés du conflit, les valeurs spécifiquement catholiques que les chrétiens n'ont pas sont de nature assez politiques justement (assujetissement au Pape ou à la Reine)

Alors, après, si tu veux vraiment aller dans des comparaisons, je ne crois pas qu'il faille comparer musulmans et catholiques, mais musulmans et chrétiens, ou alors il faut spécifier le courant musulman considéré.

Of course now that English is so common people mistranslate ""reachargeable battery"" to ""ładowalna bateria"", which is stupid, incorrect and too long, but what can you do.

Another example - we use all of these for different kinds of schools: Politechnika, Uniwersytet, Akademia, Liceum, Technikum and Gimnazjum. We steal words from everybody, from ancient Greeks to Anglophones :)

You can still write Portemonnaie but Portmonee is also allowed now (that means wallet, by the way)) or defines genders (App was written with all three genders in the Duden but that ministry decided that only Das (neutral) and Die (feminine) sound correct so only Das App or Die App is allowed now.

As a Brit, you've earned your right to gloat this time.

To pick up on your Russia's geopolitics thing, if we take for granted that Obama chipped into the UK reform/referendum debate because they'd prefer a UK on the inside to help represent traditional US fiscally-liberal values, and, if we take it as read that during the Cold War the Soviets and the KGB helped fund Communist and Socialist movements in Europe, even the likes of CND in the UK, then you'd have to be a political ostrich to think Putin and the FSB aren't operating, lobbying, manoeuvring, weaselling, manipulating just as much as ever.  

It took all Putin and Italy's PM Romano Prodi could do to not hold hands in public.

The primary difference between the KGB of then and the FSB of now is that the FSB are very much venture capitalists.  They're just as much in the private sector business as the security business, which the KGB rarely did.  Now Russia's renationalised their oil and with a wallet of cash they're looking for business, opportunity and influence.  Russia's buying in Greece.  You only have to think on how rattled the Greek people are,  and[read this](http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/29-10-2012/122618-russia_greece-0/), to appreciate how tempting that may be, and how real a serious threat of growing Russian influence is.

The problem is the EU is moving towards political centralisation, mutual indebtedness and economic homogeneity.  Niccolo Machiavelli's *The Prince* warns about these exact same dangers this exposes you to.  Just as it is in nature with diversity, so it is too in geopolitics.  You can't assimilate or decapitate a market that thrives on differences and the right to succeed and fail.   

As such the ironic thing is the *Superpower* that the author in the article is advocating is the worst possible, most dangerous, most naive solution that could be proposed.  

I can't believe a decade on from when the War On Terror was declared, with over two decades under our belts to reflect on why the Cold War ended, a journalist could propose picking up essentially the mantel of such failed twin pillared policy:  

            1.  Europe adopting a US style War On Terror in Africa   

                                      &amp;

([link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17958520))

Some one in a different thread a while ago was suggesting English become the *additional* language of Europe, meaning that it would be the default second language of every one in the EU unless they had a very good reason to pick otherwise. Kind of similar to how Hindi is in India or French in West Africa. I'm not sure how much I support that. I certainly think that other countries like France and Poland would benefit from having English play a greater role with in there borders and that they could maintain their culture whilst doing so.

There'd certainly be a lot of benefits, but even as native English speaker some thing feels odd about other places adopting English such as the universities mentioned. I don't get some imperial sense of pride out of it. If I feel anything from it, it's unease at other people feeling as though English is so successful that they *have to* adopt it at the expense of their own.

Very interesting issue.

I couldn't even tell you how it works with fluids, I know 4 quarts = one gallon, but I don't know how many cups are in a quart. To make things more confusing we also use fluid ounces and certain items are actually measured in liters. 

We only really use pounds for weight, but once it gets large enough we switch to tons (2,000 lbs) or small enough and we switch to ounces, 16 of which make up a pound (lots of drugs) or even grams (drugs) and milligrams (prescription drugs) (one ounce = 28.35 grams).

&gt; The Swedish Language

&gt; The Academy’s main objective is to work for the ’purity, vigour and majesty’ of the Swedish language, i.e. its clarity, expressiveness and prestige.

&gt; To attain this object the Academy is engaged in a number of projects, some of them permanent, some of a more temporary nature.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"It gets confusing due to us having so many people with the title of ""prince"", including the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip who's the Queen's spouse. So obviously not in line to the throne at all.

It goes like this

* 1 There's the Queen who's married to Prince Philip at the top who're incumbent.

* 2 Then there's the Queen's direct children, the oldest of which is Prince Charles the Prince of Wales whom every one despises (some of it earned, some of it not). I forget the rest of the queen's children.

* 3 Then there's the third generation of royals who're the children of Prince Charles. The eldest is Prince William, the one married to Kate, and second eldest is Prince Harry, the good looking one who goes to Afghanistan. 

* 4 We're also approaching the fourth generation which'll be Kate Middlton's baby.

So that's the simplified succession order. There's a lot of complicated things which go with it that I personally find fascinating: It's mostly to do with titles such as our queen being queen regent instead of just queen and who gets the title of Prince of Wales and why.

The only other really important detail which isn't just me going on a rant I can think of is that should one of the princes die, before their parent dies then it changes the whole succession order. For instance, if Charles dies before the queen does then all of a sudden William is not second in line for the throne and has little chance of becoming King *ever* due to the succession now deferring to Charles's brother. 

At the moment every one is crossing their fingers at hoping Charles abdicates in immediately in father of the much more popular William, but who knows.

true,SPRM,SCOT,German studying in Scotland,"Good article and I generally support its assessment. The building of a common security and defence policy within the European Union is for me, personally, one of the most important aspects of further European integration. Unfortunately, I feel there are two trends currently happening at the same time that will make such a CFSP/CSDP more difficult in the future: the continuing of the alienation of the UK within the EU as one of the two most capable military powers in Europe, and the decrease of defence budgets all over the continent - especially, I think, in Germany. There are recent talks that the defence ministry is having another round of steep budget cuts - and this in a situation where Germany is already not pulling her weight. 

I'm also afraid that significant percentages of European populations are not very comfortable with the thought of using their military forces more actively in their direct vicinity and further away. On the other hand, as the article has noted, most of the EU military missions are surprisingly low-profile. Look for example at [this](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/eeas/security-defence/eu-operations.aspx?lang=en) map - what do you think how well-known these operations are in your respective home country? Granted, most of them are relatively small, but nevertheless. I would guess the only one that is really present in people's minds is Operation Atalanta at the Horn of Africa. All of this might change though when/if such operations become more significant both quantitatively and qualitatively. 

To sum this up, I think it is generally a good idea for Europe not to (further) abandon all military capabilities because 'someone else will take care of it'. That someone was in the past most likely the USA that is now growing increasingly reluctant to do the heavy lifting alone - or at all. 

Edit: If anybody is interested in some more details about the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) or Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP, which is part of the CFSP) of the EU, feel free to ask.

Gypsy children are not declared mentally ill en masse in the Czech Republic. Those who lack social habits (for example do not know about toilets and are used to defecate in the corner of the room) go to special schools where classes are smaller and teachers have special training to deal with this.


The gypsies also do not live behind ghetto walls. There was once an soft attempt to protect innocent neighbours from vandalism and petty crime but it ended up in such a huge media rage it has to be stopped. Eventually the Czech government bought out homes of the neighbours, they moved away and the whole area is now completely devastated.


True, gypsies live in horrible housing conditions, but that's just their fault. Typically they obtain completely new or renovated flats from the city, devastate them thoroughly and then ask the city to give them another house.  (They invariably get it but it takes some time, social housing is not big item here.) No Czech had devasteted these houses, Czechs avoid these places.


But I see one solution for the problem. Since you have shown so much care for the gypsies why not take few of them personally? It is enough to post your address and I will make sure some family will move to your place. Then you can handle them better than those uncivilized  Czechs.

true,mberre,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; The gypsies also do not live behind ghetto walls.

Let me guess... you've never been to Usti-nad lebem. Right? 
That town has two gypsy quarters (because they have two tribes of gypsies). When I was there in 2005, this is what I saw.

One tribe lives in a recreation of the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw.. complete with 4-meter brick wall and police checkpoint at the entrance. 

The other has no wall. In 2003 the city tried to build a wall around the second tribe's part of town. then some civil rights campaigners came and built tents right *in the path of the wall*. SO, ultimately, the wall was abandoned. 

Frankly, denying the situation will not exactly make it any less true. But.. I understand your emotions. Look, I'm an American... and we... have a similar thing going on. We have a naval base in Guantanamo.... which officially *does not* contain a prison... where people who *are not* prisoners of war *have not* been tortured. .. But, like I just told you, denying the truth does not make it any less true. 

&gt; Since you have shown so much care for the gypsies.... 

People tell me similar things about the Al-Queda guys who are ""just hanging out"" in Guantanamo. I'm questioning the barbarity of my government... so I ""must love al-queda"" right?

SO.. I'm calling out the pathetically un-civilized way in which the Czech state treats some of its own citizens... who just happen to be non-white... for what it is. Basically it's a skin-head state which has no place in the EU or NATO, or the OECD. Do I have to love any of the parties involved? No.. actually I don't. I just expect that Czechs learn to behave civilized towards their own ethnic minorities (those ethnicities that are left anyways).

&gt; Then you can handle them better than those uncivilized Czechs.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a perfect system, there are economic cycles, I won't dispute that, but to claim that the system is flawed and needs replacing, that's insane, what the system needs is to be let to work freely and other areas which are not of its concern (like monetary policy or law and order) to be properly managed by the state. If the state fails to do these, we can't expect the free market system to operate properly, but in that case we can't say capitalism is the culprit.

&gt;I would still see the cause as the thing which originally caused the problem (in this case market failures), and the poor response of the authorities significantly aggravated the problem.

Significantly aggravated is putting it extremely lightly. Had the monetary policy of the time pursued an expansionist monetary policy, the Great Depression of 1929 would be just a footnote in the books of history.

true,multubunu,ROMA,România,"&gt;Limba rumânească to Limba românească

Rumân and român came to mean different things long before the relatinization movement (the former meaning serf, the latter romanian).

I believe the relatinizing movement practically failed in what it had set out to do. Most words it proposed failed to catch and some are still here only because they were ridiculed by contemporaries (sufragiu, amor, amic etc.). Many (most?) slavic words that disappeared did so due to the obsolescence of their object; for instance _ispravnic_ (approx prefect) disappeared with the position, but _ispravă_, _isprăvi_, _neisprăvit_ are still here, perhaps a bit quaint.

Here's for instance a list of slavic words that Titu Maiorescu ([Neologismele, 1881](http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Neologismele)) picked up just from words starting with B and C, that he claimed would be hard to replace with latin words:

&gt;balan, balaur, ban, bici, blană, bob, bolovan, brazdă, breaslă, brici, bujor, buruiană; cârcei, calic, cârciumă și birt, cârjă, cârmă, cârn, cârpă, cârtiță, ceată, ceață, cep, ciocan, ciolan, cireadă, clătesc, clește, clocotesc, clopot, coajă, coabe, copită, cosiță, coș, covrig, crâncen, castravete, creț, crivăț, croiesc.

They are _all_ still in current use, with just one - calic - being used mostly metaphorically (avaricious instead of poor/beggar); it was replaced with another slavic word, _sărac_. Also, if you understand Romanian, you will notice in the article strange word forms, e.g. _emoțiune_ where we now say _emoție_, a sign that latinizers didn't fully get their way even where their neologisms survived.

Relatinization succeeded mostly in accustoming the public to foreign import. Consequently, almost all new words in the 20th century are taken from French or Italian (but also German, and more recently English), where perhaps they might have been created from scratch as needed. This does skew the latin word proportion of the lexicon, but most of the original Slavic words are alive and kicking.

Hell, we say _da_ for _yes_, you don't, ano? ;)

Seeing as you obviously enjoyed this story so much it's obviously a story Americans want to hear which means a journalist wants to make it, whether it's true or not.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; The only other really important detail which isn't just me going on a rant I can think of is that should one of the princes die, before their parent dies then it changes the whole succession order. For instance, if Charles dies before the queen does then all of a sudden William is not second in line for the throne and has little chance of becoming King ever due to the succession now deferring to Charles's brother. 

Uh, what? If Charles dies before QEII, then William, being second-in-line, moves up to being heir. In the British monarchy, succession moves down (to children) before it moves over (to siblings). For Charles' brother to become King, Charles, William, and Harry would all have to die (and Will's kid if the baby is born before this tragic occurrence). The line of succession is currently:

* QEII 

   * Charles, Prince of Wales 

       * William, Duke of Cambridge 

          * (William's kid) 

      * Harry 

   * Andrew, Prince of York

       * Beatrice 
       
       * Eugenie

    * Edward, Earl of Wessex

      * James, Viscount Severn

      * Lady Louise Windsor

   * Anne, Princess Royal 

Top of the list is the monarch, and each line down represents the next in line. The indentations represent generations: Charles, Andrew, Edward, and Anne are Queen Elizabeth's children; William and Harry are Charles' children, etc..

There are monarchies where succession passes from oldest to youngest sibling (Saudi Arabia, for example), but Britain is not one of them.

Edit: Because citing your sources is important, [here](http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/Successionandprecedence/Succession/Overview.aspx) is the line of succession as recorded by [HRM website](http://www.royal.gov.uk/hmthequeen/hmthequeen.aspx).",0,1359417997,null,0,1359419003,0,c85am6o,t3_17fqam,t1_c85am6o,t1_c85482y,null,1431112251,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Per esempio, io e te potremmo stipulare un contratto in base al quale, dietro un compenso di 50 euro (premio), io mi impegno a venderti l'anonimo quadro appeso nel mio soggiorno tra 6 mesi al prezzo di 1.000 euro. Tu sei libero di comprarlo oppure no, ma io sono obbligato a vendertelo se lo vuoi. Questa è un'opzione call, cioè di acquisto, dove una controparte (io) si impegna a vendere a un prezzo prefissato, e l'altra (tu) ha l'opzione di comprare a quel prezzo. Se tu tra sei mesi non lo vuoi, io ci guadagno 50 euro e mi tengo il quadro. Se invece me lo compri, mi dai i 1.000 euro e io ti consegno il quadro. Io potrei rimetterci (probabile, altrimenti non avresti esercitato l'opzione) oppure guadagnarci. Quanto vale questo diritto di opzione? Inizialmente 50 euro, ma poi il valore dipende da quello del sottostante. Per esempio, se nel frattempo si scopre che il mio è un quadro d'autore, che vale 30.000 euro, improvvisamente il valore del diritto di comprarlo a 1.000 euro aumenta di prezzo. Se invece viene fuori che è una crosta che vale 120 euro, nessuno sano di mente lo comprerebbe a 1.000 euro, quindi l'opzione che hai in mano è carta straccia (e io mi tengo il quadro e i miei 50 euro).

Ovviamente non mi risulta che esistano derivati sui quadri, anche perché i derivati sono contratti standardizzati, spesso trattati sui mercati finanziari, ma esistono su azioni, obbligazioni, beni reali (rame, carbone, caffè, petrolio, pancetta, succo d'arancia, carburante per aerei...), valute estere, tassi di interesse, mutui e altri crediti, indici di borsa, e persino su altri derivati. Oltre alle opzioni esistono i future (contratti a termine con importo prefissato), gli swap, i forward, ecc.

La caratteristica comune di tutti questi derivati è che il loro valore dipende dal valore di qualcos'altro. A volte questa relazione è diretta (come nel caso dell'opzione call), a volte è inversa. Servono alle aziende da coprirsi dai rischi, che possono essere di fluttuazione nel valore (ho comprato delle azioni e voglio che se il prezzo scende il valore del mio derivato salga), di liquidità (ho un mutuo a tasso variabile e ho paura che i tassi salgano), di insolvenza (ho prestato dei soldi a un tizio disoccupato e ho paura che non me li restituisca), di prezzo (devo produrre tubi in rame e ho paura che il prezzo della materia prima nei prossimi sei mesi salga).
Caratteristica dei derivati è la leva: con un relativamente piccolo investimento iniziale (il premio) si è esposti a grandi perdite o a grandi profitti (se viene fuori che il mio quadro è un Tiziano la tua opzione diventa preziosissima), per questo a volte sono usati anche per scopi speculativi, cioè per vere e proprie scommesse. A volte la scommessa si vince, e allora i responsabili vengono premiati dalle loro aziende con bonus e gratifiche; altre volte vanno male e se la posta in gioco è alta, si possono generare perdite catastrofiche. Le banche dovrebbero avere dei sistemi di controllo interno, cioè delle regole e delle autorizzazioni, per impedire che i rischi assunti siano eccessivi. Un caso clamoroso di assenza di tali controlli si verificò nel gennaio del 1995, quando un impiegato di Singapore della banca inglese [Barings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barings_Bank#1995_collapse), superando questi controlli, fece delle operazioni talmente avventate con i derivati che causò il crollo della banca, sopraffatta dalle perdite, tanto che pochi mesi dopo la banca olandese ING si comprò la Baring al prezzo simbolico di una sterlina.",0,1359418146,null,0,1359418398,0,c85anxh,t3_17g88m,t1_c85anxh,t3_17g88m,null,1431112285,20,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,20

You answered yourself in the next paragraph. I didn't say it needs replacing, I said the causes of many (though not all) crises are failures inherent to the market economy as it exists today.

Nor is it a reduction in debt, deficits, emigration from the worst effected countries, foreclosures, unemployment, businesses shutting down type of recovery. It is also not a rising GDP type of recovery. So what kind of recovery is it?

""The more upbeat assessment has doused hopes of any further cuts in interest rates but *most economists think the economy will contract overall this year*.""

Oh, so it's a deepening of the recession type of recovery. That must be new type of recovery. I wonder if it's as good as the more traditional type of recovery?

I derivati sono strumenti il cui prezzo ""normale"" si ottiene con calcoli e processi non molto semplici, e pertanto andrebbero acquistati solo da gente che ha una certa preparazione; ci sono GIA' regolamentazioni in questo senso, e non vedo il bisogno di aggiungerne altre. 

Un caso piu' vicino a noi e dove ci sono state gravi irregolarita' e' quello degli swap sui tassi di interesse che alcune banche hanno ""venduto"" a vari comuni italiani (fregandogli una marea di soldi). La cosa interessante  e' che in base a questi contratti swap in realta' all' atto della firma erano le banche a dare dei soldi ai comuni, che avrebbero ripagato in futuro, in base al variare dei tassi di interesse. Ovviamente non c'e' un tesoriere comunale che ne capisca una mazza dell' andamento dei tassi di interesse, e alla fine dei giochi si sono ritrovati a dover pagare molto piu' di quello che pensavano. Ma a loro poco ne importava perche' incassavano subito soldi con cui pagare amici e conoscenti, mentre a ripagare sarebbero state le future amministrazioni quando loro erano gia' in pensione. Per fare certi lavori l' onesta' e' un fallo e non un pregio. Se ne vuoi sapere di piu' guarda la puntata che report dedico' a questa storia.

DIVERSO E' IL CASO DI MPS di cui avrai sentito certamente parlare in questi giorni, insieme ai derivati alexandria, santorini etc etc. Nessun banchiere all' epoca della stesura di quei derivati avrebbe mai pensato che i tassi di interesse sarebbero saliti a breve; cio' perche' il lievitare dei tassi e' associato a fasi economiche di crescita ed e' dal 2007 o giu' di li' che la crescita si trova solo in oceania ed asia, e questo lo sanno anche i banchieri della cassa di risparmio popolare cooperativo di mezzacalzetta.

Come nel caso dei derivati venduti ai comuni quei contratti sono stati realizzati per presentare a bilancio guadagni nell' anno in corso, spostando le perdite nel futuro. In gergo si chiama window dressing perche' e' come mettere le tende alla finestra per non far vedere dentro casa a chi sta fuori. 

MI URGE SPECIFICARE IN STAMPATELLO PERO' che le perdite che c'erano da nascondere in MPS non derivavano assolutamente da swap o altri derivati, bensi' dall' acquisto ad un prezzo spropositato della banca antonveneta, pagata al DOPPIO del prezzo di mercato, neanche tre mesi dopo che qualcun'altro la aveva comprata ad un prezzo molto piu' ragionevole, peraltro a crisi economica ampiamente iniziata.

true,Lord_Monboddo,SCOT,Scotland,"Yes I'd say Scots has the same origin points as modern English, it grew out of Old English and developed alongside English, they're basically cousin languages. Scots was influenced differently along the way it's true but that has no bearing on what the root language was so I'd say this graph for Scots and Scottish Gaelic is accurate (after all it can't go through all the influences of each language). 

Fairwolf is right in that Scots has significant bits of Gaelic including Gaelic sentence structure which still affect the way Scots speak to this day. It also has some Norse, French and even a little bit of Flemish and German too.

This is why for instance Scots use words that are now outdated in English but originate in Anglo-Saxon such as ""aye"" or ""shite"" because English became increasingly influenced by Norman French unlike Scots which retained many old Anglo-Saxon words. 

I think some Scots are worried admitting Scots originates in English but I wouldn't be so concerned, whatever it's origins and whatever we speak now Scots remains a rich source of descriptive and poetic language as well as some fantastic insults such as bampot, bamstick, hackit, minging, shann gadgie, numptie, baucle, bawjaws, tolly, eejit, fud (you can note these down for future use if you want).

Because you don't have to implement Chinese regulations in the UK. With the EEA you'd still end up having to implement those regulations. Just take a look at Norway and Switzerland.
