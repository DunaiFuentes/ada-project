""perché si dice mungitori e non mungivacche?"", oppure ""sono l'unico che si lava per sporcarmi, nel caso che mi sia porcato""), ma ha incluso anche qualche osservazione che non si basa strettamente sui giochi di parole. Le mie preferite sono:

* *Perché dire: pagare in contanti e non in contati? E al contrario, perché dire trascurato e non trascurante?*

* *Perché dire quadrante la mostra di un orologio, che è rotonda, e chiamare circolare un foglio stampato che è quadrangolare?*

* *Perché dire rosso d'ovo il tuorlo che è giallo, nero il vino rosso e bianco il vino giallo?*

* *Si dice spesso: il tale gode cattiva fama. È proprio vero che chi si contenta gode...*

* *Perché si dice: passare uno per le armi, mentre sono le armi che trapassano lui?*

* *Farsi la barba: disfarsela! Dare la polvere: toglierla!*

* *Vedendo lo stemma mussulmano, che pare una buccia di popone ed è quindi all'incirca una quarta parte del disco lunare, noi parliamo di mezzaluna, mentre, quando vediamo illuminata mezza luna, con tutta serietà parliamo di primo o ultimo quarto!*

3. Student

4. Black born and raised in french west indies

5. Banlieue parisienne

6. less possible

7. It was Booba

8. Hip-hop mean a lot to me but french hip-hop turn around the same shit, I've grown up and I think there is more work done in English hip-hop and the french one is a circle-jerk between the same dude and the same lyrics.

9. Why it attracts me when I was young ? The beat, but I can listen to all type of music and enjoy it. That's weird to say because in my island when you're black you are moraly limited to certain type of music and white people music is not one of them.

12. In France about their neighborhood and how they mastered it, how they spend all the money they have.

13. Kery James tries but I don't think there is a very political sense in french rap.

14. All I see it's them trying to be political but never open their mouth when they should only time to time when they need ton sell their albums. 

15. Fucking yes! I'm from french west indies I'm less for this country than an african immigrant. There was a product forbidden in 1950 in France they fed us with it till 2000. If you are not a sports guy you are nothing for them. An island paralysed during 30 days and it's nothing for them.

16. The issues which is the more important in my eyes is youth education. Go to school to learn something not to fuck a girl in the bathroom, not to get pregnant, not to not be at your home. Some youth in the less favored class think they can have money when they want or that a job at MC DO is something awesome they care about the money but do not see the budget.

17. Yes

18. I'm not sure about that.

19. Well, we all have this hip-hop culture now.

Kokinov offers advice to Naydenov on how to avoid prosecution and assuages him the case would not hold water in Court.

Similar to how someone leaked information to Biserov, so that he can resign before the accusations.

&gt;“Kokinov confirms suspicions and media reports about Tsatsarov being handpicked by Borisov. (""Don't smirk, you handpicked him,"" Kokinov is heard saying.)

The chief prosecutor is appointed by the president, who is from the same party. Nothing surprising here. Also, obviously a bad call as far as GERB is concerned, seeing how he is only going after them and not after BSP. That shitshow with the smearing attempt against GERB performed by TV 7 + BSP with the fake ballots? I don't see him doing anything about it. Police now requiring ID cards for no good reason and refusing to identify themselves (which is illegal)? I don't see him doing anything about it. The prime minister saying he will fire government employees who attend protests (both illegal and unconsitutional)? I don't see Tsatsarov doing anything about it. The ""bullet points"" (опорни точки) where the police is carrying out political favors for the BSP and against GERB by spreading misinformation, discrediting people and misrepresenting facts and also trying to downplay the protests (completely illegal)? I don't see Tsatsarov doing anything about it. (The last one is a bigger scandal than Peevski + Biserov together, it brings us back to the good old days where State Security was doing the same kind of shit). 

Obviously, BSP + DPS are more corrupt. That's why they lost trust so fast. GERB only lost power because they were unable to handle the energy crisis, that was the main cause of the protests in February. Now it's just corruption and the protests are far bigger and persistent. 

Why are you writing this from a brand new account?

Also, seeing that you are anonymous, who are you planning to vote for? I will probably go for the Reformist block. They are corrupt too (Kasim Dal for example), but what can you do. 

EDIT : Also, note how there are never any leaks against the communists. In 1997, Ivan Kostov was wiretapped and the audio was released. In 1999 in Lovech, Nadezhda Mihailova was recorded and the audio got released (massive emabrassment, media censorship). Now this is hapenning against GERB and in particular the prime minister.

I am an Irishman who has been living in the UK for 7 years.

I work as an economist (full disclosure not a macro/finance guy!) so can usually follow the discussion and am always impressed with the level of technicality in a lot of the Irish media with regards to economics. 

I wonder if this is one of those ""cant see the wood for the trees issues"" as I go home fairly regularly, roughly 3-4 times a year. I remember the discussions and the situation 2-3 years ago and the difference is staggering.

Ireland is not clear of the storm but that is a fact not particular to our small, highly integrated, exporting, financially curious country. We are dependent on demand from overseas, but so I nearly every country. 

Information on macro economic issues is notoriously complex and ephemeral but in terms of the information that I have passively observed: media rhetoric, defect levels and (potentially most reliably) the market price of secondary exchanges of Irish debt, our situation has improved in a big way.

true,demos11,null,null,"Several ways: 

1) They ignore them whenever possible. 

2) After enough momentum has been achieved by protesters, the government organizes counter-protests, which have so far consisted of mainly senior citizens and minorities. These people are brought to the capital by bus and train, and handed out various posters with pro-government slogans. It is widely believed these ""counter-protesters"" are also paid for their attendance, beyond their already covered transport costs.

3) The current political parties in power have a mutually-beneficial relationship with a media group, which consists of a major tv channel, numerous online news sites, and basically all the gossip and weekend type printed media that circulates the country. Without going into too much detail, the owner of this media group has a son, and her son is the one who almost became head of the Bulgarian version of the FBI (DANS), which was what sparked the first protests over 150 days ago. (The guy is in his early 30s, has a history of corrupt behavior, and has less experience in that particular field than someone who has watched all 8 seasons of 24). This media group has adopted the strategy of destroying the image Bulgaria's current President, who has been using his position's mostly ceremonial powers and his own public reach to try to fight the current regime. By tarnishing his image, the group has succeeded in diverting the attention of a lot of the nation's people to him, and thus have created a lot of breathing room for their partner politicians to achieve their goals. 

The main problem, however, is not what the parties in power at the moment are doing to stay in power. It is that there is NOBODY to replace them. The ""opposition"", and I use the term loosely, have their own problems, which they demonstrated over and over during their recent term, and picking between them and the current leaders is like picking if you want your arm or leg cut off. The remaining political players have bad organization and a tiny voter base, which isn't likely to change any time soon. 

This is why the current protests are important only as a symbol, and not in any practical sense. The reality is that until the country is free of certain elements in its political leadership, many of whom represent foreign interests as well as their personal ones (and rarely the interests of Bulgaria), no amount of protesting and political reform will change a thing.

The skewed representation of events by, say, news channels was always known to me and my family, but some people were (and still are) unaware of the deceit. The protests weren't reported anywhere except online for the first few weeks and since then have been portrayed mostly as ""small gatherings of delinquents"". My grandmother was unaware of how serious things were until I told her about a month ago (the ninth month since the first protest), since she doesn't often leave her apartment and the protests are mostly in Sofia (the capital), even though they began in Varna.    
The reason there is no reliable information source is pretty much because of said media mogul (Peevski, the one they tried to nominate for head of security) and some other people of his kind.    
For instance, you know these little booths that sell mostly smokes and newspapers? Well, I recently noticed that they started refurbishing them into booths with the name ""Lafka"". It turns out that they've all been bought by this Peevski guy's companies and it turns out there are some laws that allow only those stores to sell newspapers, which in turn means that printed news is only what they want them to be. That's not the only problem with these things. They also eliminate any competition, they leave people without jobs, they're blocking sidewalks and the rent they pay is surprisingly small (40$/mo on average, AFAIK, while it should be about 300$).

Now, if you see how much trouble a corrupt guy can cause just by buying those silly booths, you should also be able to sit back and feel amazed with what he can do with everything else, including politics.

Also, there is widespread belief (conspiracy theory) that it really doesn't matter whom we will elect as a new government, as they are really not the ones in control - they are just puppets.

&gt;Europe’s disappearing borders  
By Valerio Vincenzo  
Political and economic agreements have brought borders down across the continent  
Since the signing of the Schengen Agreements in 1985, the borders of most of the European continent have been erased little by little from the landscape and from people’s imagination. The agreements are a giant leap in the progressive unification of Europe and the emergence of a European consciousness. Today, with 26 countries belonging to the Schengen Area, 16,500km of borders can be freely crossed. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union has ratified the historical importance of this almost imperceptible but radical change in Europe.  
Since 2007, with the help of a GPS navigation device and detailed maps, I have conducted eight trips along these erased borderlines. I calculated that I crossed the borders more than a thousand times without having to show my papers.  
Even if these pictures have been taken thousands of kilometres apart, they all provide an image that is far from the stereotype we tend to associate with the notion of a border.",0,1384655762,null,0,1384656067,0,cdg3320,t3_1qrzky,t1_cdg3320,t1_cdg2eoy,null,1428629678,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

This well-known fact wasn't a problem until the founding of the Eurozone in its present form. 

Numerous economists predicted that a crisis like the current one was unavoidable if such heterogeneous economies like Greece and Germany were both to become members of a currency union with no internal fiscal transfers. They were ignored.

Why is it now that Germany gets all the blame, instead of those responsible for creating this deeply flawed Eurozone? They are doing what they have been doing for decades: successfully exporting goods and services -  with an increasing share going to countries *outside* the Eurozone. 

&gt;A July 1998 Reuters poll showed 34 out of 42 economists backing the presidents of the European Central Bank and Bundesbank in their belief that the fiscal policies of some countries were too loose before euro adoption. Respondents were also asked to name the countries they thought had fiscal policies that were too lax in the run-up to the euro's launch.

&gt;Topping the list were Ireland, Spain and Italy.

&gt;A Predictable Crisis    
&gt;Europe’s single currency was bound to break down.     
&gt;Martin Feldstein June 14, 2010, Vol. 15, No. 37

&gt;The current crisis of the European single currency was an accident waiting to happen. The adverse consequences of imposing a single currency on a disparate group of countries were initially hidden by the short-run advantages that the weakest countries enjoyed when they adopted the euro in 1999—and by the favorable global economic conditions that prevailed until 2008. But we now see very serious problems affecting both individual eurozone countries and the overall single currency system.

yawn.

The prevailing view in the investor/geopolitical community is highly bullish on Europe right now. Unless a serious unexpected internal or external headwind plunged the continent back into deep recession, the next 5 years should be a slow but steady return to relative growth and prosperity in the eurozone. a major thing that is going to change the game if we are all lucky is for the coming [coalition government in Germany](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-13/german-spd-chief-set-to-sell-party-on-merkel-coalition.html) to implement pro-growth, pro-Europe policies like the first german minimum wage and more German money for the EU development funds. Additionally the EU itself is going to more and more forcefully make Germany do this stuff regardless of what happens with the coalition. They just opened an inquiry into Germany's persistent trade surplus. If Germany can be convinced in the 5 year medium term to be more progressive to the EU, the EU will be in an even better position. the central bank has indicated its commitment to stability and liquidity, and glacial progress on the banking union will hopefully happen within 2 years, just in time for the EU and US to sign their trade deal and help us both out. Whatever the political climate in the EU, the EU is integrating more and more everyday, and remains the world's largest economy (though at current growth trends the US will retake this distinction and then China in the decade).


wow I wrote all that without reading the article, just the summary. this article is trash. full of stinky statistics and outright errors. ""most EU states don't meet the minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on military spending"", yes, but between Italy, France, and England you 3 of the top 7 or so militaries in the world. If their economies even remotely right themselves in the medium term, this status will remain (and England appears already to be back on track we hope). it appears ""geopolitical relevance"" might be code for ""NATO participation as measured by Americans""

ugh ""For the first time since World War II, the output of the advanced industrialized democracies represents less than 50 percent of global GDP. The aggregate GDP of China is expected to surpass that of the United States within roughly 15 years."" Yes, **because Asian countries are turning into advanced industrialized (hopefully) democracies.  China will have nearly 3x the people the US does when it hits our GDP, and much higher inequality**

Also another thing is even in the context of the EU, which I support as a global institution or whatever, the concept of ""european"" global influence is nonsensical. Germany, France, and England remain three of the most developed nations on earth, leaders in industry, research, finance, scholarship, etc. Especially due to Germany's success in the recession, Germany's global clout is increasing constantly. London is a critical financial capital. Even smaller countries too. The Netherlands is fucked economically right now, but still one of the richest countries on earth, with corporations around the globe. Switzerland remains a banking and culture capital and a refuge for the global elite. Poland is rapidly rising to its rightful status as the sixth large European nation, and it is rapidly militarising along the way. 

**tl;dr people who are doomsday about Europe are stacking unrealistic repeated expectations of bad luck for the EU in the coming decade. not only is this academically misleading because it's not the most likely outcome, it's just mean-spirited and petty.

Funny this article goes on about bad economics because the journalist seems to have completely misdiagnosed the cause of the crisis. Aside from Greece, the crisis in the periphery countries arose from the financial sector and not from public spending. 

If you look at debt to GDP for [Ireland](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/government-debt-to-gdp) and [Spain](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/government-debt-to-gdp) and it paints a very different picture from what the journalist suggests. Debt levels in both countries were well below the prescribed level set out in the Stability and Growth Pact and they managed to comply with the rules on budget deficits. If we look at Germany during this period, it's clear that it didn't fulfil the criteria either for reducing its debt or on occasion to [controlling its deficit.](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-03-1560_en.htm)

That is not to say for a minute that the booms in both countries peripheral were sustainable or that Germany wasn't pushing through reforms during this period to restore competitiveness.

true,IAmNotAToy,null,null,"Hmmm... Lets do a simple picture comparison.

[This picture](http://dnes.dir.bg/tagp_gallery.php?id=126380&amp;num=9) from the pro-government demonstrations yesterday has its background blurred so it is not very clear where the sea of people ends. Focus is on the people and banners in the foreground. But if you look closely, you can see that it does not reach all the way to the tall building on the left side where there is a slope on the road.

[This picture](http://i.imgur.com/XcbchHE.jpg) is from the pro-government demonstrations yesterday but from a different angle. You can clearly see the front and the end of the crowd. OK. Lets assume it was not taken at the height of the demonstration. Could have been too early or too late. Just for the sake of the argument I'll add [another one](http://i.imgur.com/h4Zpx50.png) of the same same scene taken from a nearby building. 

So lets compare the above to [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/LzilqL1.jpg) of the **anti-government** protests taken on 8th of July. You clearly see the road full of people all the way up the slope where you have the tall building on the left. And picture has been taken from a viewpoint further back compared to the other two pictures. The traffic lights seem a few meters away here while it is closest object on the second picture. 


If there are 50 000 on the first pro-government pictures then surely the number must be double on the last anti-government one.

Fun fact: estimates of the number of people on the protests officially come from the police. Who are run by who? Yep, you guessed it right. The government. Those guys who have organised the rallies on the first pictures.

true,flyingorange,VOJV,Vojvodina,"&gt; If you believe hungarians in Romania are being discriminated against then feel free to point out specific examples. As it stands, hungarians have the right to propagate their culture and language. Isn't that the main reason why hungarians in Romania ask for autonomy? 

I see on Facebook people complaining about Romanians all the time, someone got called a bozgor, the other one tried to talk to a clerk in Hungarian and the clerk didn't want to understand her etc. This is not the statistical bullshit about how everyone has all the rights they need, this is real life.    
As I said, Hungarians in Romania complain to their friends and relatives in Hungary, they in turn vote for parties who promiss to do something about it.

&gt; Just like OneRichBastard, you have a gross misunderstanding of the situation in Transylvania.

I only know what I'm being told by people living in Transylvania so yes, it's possible that I don't understand anything at all. You on the other hand maybe live there but you don't seem to know much about why the Hungarians protest. You only seem to care how the Romanians feel.

&gt; If Hungarians want to improve their reputation to Romanians outside Transylvania they should probably attempt to clarify the autonomy ordeal and what autonomy would mean if it were to be granted.

And this is the point where the whole discussion fails. Why should the Hungarians explain anything to the Romanian majority? What does it matter how the Romanians feel?    

Look at it this way:     
1. Hungarians get autonomy      
   =&gt; Hungarians feel better about their life     
   =&gt; Romanians feel the same as before        
2. Hungarians don't get autonomy       
   =&gt; Hungarians feel worse about their life  
   =&gt; Romanians feel the same as before

You see my point? This doesn't affect the way Romanians live their everyday life. The Romanians' fear doesn't lead to any improvements, it's a waste of everyone's time and leads to negative feelings. If instead they worked in favor of the Hungarians then the sum of changes would be positive.    
The argument that a minority needs to convince the majority is dumb, it never worked and never will. It's like asking the blacks from the 1950'es to sit down and try to convince the southern whites to change. Or blacks to talk things through with the Apartheid regime in South Africa. It's not how things work. In all cases it was a third party which forced the majority to change, and in the case of Romania it will probably be the EU that eventually steps in.

&gt; Would Hungarians agree to part of their country declaring its independence? 

I wouldn't give a shit if any part of Hungary wanted to separate. If they wanted to live elsewhere it's their business. As I said, this is the 21st century, them separating will affect my life 0%.

Which leads me to the question: **an independent Szeklerland in Romania, how would it affect *your* life**? Keep in mind that we're in the EU, no borders, free trade etc. are all in effect.

Lastly, you didn't answer my question from my previous post: Do you think the Hungarians in Romania feel it's great that Moldovans are getting Romanian citizenship?

&gt; Romanians constitute a majority in both Romania and Moldova. 

There still are Hungarians living in Romania and how they feel about an issue *should* matter. But I've tried this argument before without success and it seems you just ""don't get"" what I'm saying. So let's try this:

These are your own words, I've just replaced a few names: Hungarians constitute a majority in both Hungary and Szeklerland. Romanians, on the other hand, do not constitute a majority of Transdnistria's population and considering the historical ethnic tensions between Romanians and Russians in Transdnistria this law is seen as an attempt at internal meddling by Romania in Moldavia's internal affairs.

Utterly and completely wrong. Member States (and even individuals) can and do quite often successfully contest EU actions at the Court of Justice of the EU on the grounds that they infringe the EU Treaties, and in particular [Art. 5 of the Treaty on the European Union](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions#Article_5), which puts strict limits on the competences of the EU. Quite recently, the UK, for instance, [successfully contested on this ground some exceptional powers granted to the European Securities and Markets Authority](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=140965&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=6009892).

Even more to the point, the treaties give the Member States the most powerful instrument there can be to safeguard their ""states' rights"": the right to withdraw at any time, which the Southern states of the US famously weren't allowed to do...

&gt; There is no European demos or common European feeling

A commonly-repeated Europhobic chestnut, and also demonstrably false: the European ""demos"" made its voice very loudly heard, for instance, ten years ago, in the run-up to the Iraq war. It was (some) national governments who refused to listen to it, not the EU...

EDIT:

&gt; The executive branch of the (EU) federal government is appointed, not elected; the federal legislature and member states cannot shut down the government to bring it to heel, though the legislature can compel the entire federal executive to resign en masse (which it once did to get rid of a few ministers).

Not even in the US is the executive branch directly elected: even the President is indirectly elected by the electoral college, whose vote may be different than the popular vote (remember 2000?). As for the members of his Cabinet, they are all appointed, from the Vice-President downwards. Finally, not only can both the European Parliament and the Council both very easily bring the Commission down to heel (and you give a good example yourself), but even individual Member States through their veto powers, as most famously done by de Gaulle and Thatcher...

It's Facebook, not real life, and Facebook is not a very good source. 

&gt;As I said, Hungarians in Romania complain to their friends and relatives in Hungary, they in turn vote for parties who promiss to do something about it.

Do you have any evidence for this?

&gt;I only know what I'm being told by people living in Transylvania so yes, it's possible that I don't understand anything at all. You on the other hand maybe live there but you don't seem to know much about why the Hungarians protest. You only seem to care how the Romanians feel.

I understand very well why the Hungarians protest. Unfortunately, the protests themselves are aimless and, in the end, completely pointless.

&gt;And this is the point where the whole discussion fails. Why should the Hungarians explain anything to the Romanian majority? What does it matter how the Romanians feel? 

What do you mean? Should the Romanians not be consulted about what goes on in their own country? How far do you believe such an arrogance stance will take you? 

&gt;You see my point? This doesn't affect the way Romanians live their everyday life. 

It does affect the life of the Romanians living in Szekely Land and at the same time it would be seen as an attempt at dividing the country, something which no Romanian would agree to. 

&gt;The Romanians' fear doesn't lead to any improvements, it's a waste of everyone's time and leads to negative feelings.

And you believe that by forcing autonomy with no regard to what the population thinks is a good way to calm these fears?

&gt;The argument that a minority needs to convince the majority is dumb, it never worked and never will. It's like asking the blacks from the 1950'es to sit down and try to convince the southern whites to change. Or blacks to talk things through with the Apartheid regime in South Africa. It's not how things work.

The fact that you would even compare Apartheid to the Hungarian minority in Romania shows me just how ignorant you truly are.

&gt;I wouldn't give a shit if any part of Hungary wanted to separate. If they wanted to live elsewhere it's their business. As I said, this is the 21st century, them separating will affect my life 0%.

I'm not asking whether you would agree with it, I'm asking whether the majority of Hungarians would. Would they?

&gt;Which leads me to the question: an independent Szeklerland in Romania, how would it affect your life? Keep in mind that we're in the EU, no borders, free trade etc. are all in effect.

If Szekely Land declared independence it would not remain in the EU and considering how economically backwards the region as well as the tensions that would undoubtedly appear it would just turn into another Kosovo. 

&gt;Lastly, you didn't answer my question from my previous post: Do you think the Hungarians in Romania feel it's great that Moldovans are getting Romanian citizenship?

As I've pointed out to you before, the situations are not comparable.

&gt;There still are Hungarians living in Romania and how they feel about an issue should matter.

Are they not allowed to vote? Are they not allowed to form political organisations? The main party representing the Hungarians in Romania has been in almost every government since its founding.

&gt;These are your own words, I've just replaced a few names: Hungarians constitute a majority in both Hungary and Szeklerland. Romanians, on the other hand, do not constitute a majority of Transdnistria's population and considering the historical ethnic tensions between Romanians and Russians in Transdnistria this law is seen as an attempt at internal meddling by Romania in Moldavia's internal affairs

You need to maintain at least a semblance of consistency. 

Moldova and Romania are two countries that share the exact same language and culture. Romania and Hungary, on the other hand, do not. 


&gt; In all cases it was a third party which forced the majority to change, and in the case of Romania it will probably be the EU that eventually steps in.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yeah, it appears that hearty had some sort of semantic shift over the years. (a hearty meal, etc). But sometimes it works. (e.g. a hearty laugh) For students of German, however, it's not hard (I don't think so at least) to mentally using the word ""hearty"" to mean ""of the heart"" just as a way to help you remember. More technically, I suppose the translation might better be ""heartly/heartily"", since ""-lich"" corresponds to English ""-ly"". I suspect that to most Americans, hearty/heartily is good but might sound a tad archaic. (it's a word you sometimes find in a biblical/prayer texts, for example). Students of German have no problems with things like ""schön"", which tends to get translated in dictionaries as ""beautiful"", but which has a zillion other uses. The ""beautiful"" placemarker seems to be good enough that English speakers ""get it"". 

Anyway, I'm always fascinated by all the cognates between the two languages, how the semantics sometimes changes (and in what manner), and that students still insist that ""Spanish is the easiest language to learn."" I disagree, obviously. ;) Also, good on you for pointing out that ""cordial"" is a cognate as well.

E' innegabile (e tu, giornalista politico e immagino anche storico per formazione o per diletto, non puoi non saperlo) che il rapporto fra popolazione e criminalità organizzata è cambiato molto dagli anni '70 a oggi, soprattutto per quanto riguarda la dinamica del consenso.

Quello che progressivamente hanno fatto le mafie negli ultimi 30 anni è di avvicinarsi sempre di più ai centri del potere, allontanandosi dalla popolazione che alla mafia (e si può negarlo ma il fatto resta) ha sempre dato legittimità - il porcellum, tra le altre cose, è espressione e conseguenza di questo trend.

Questo, come appunto dice l' autore, comportava un controllo e un appoggio bidirezionale fra mafie e popolazione - legame che sta venendo a mancare ora. Per assurdo, ed esagerando (ma non troppo), si potrebbe perfino insinuare che la mafia è la forma in cui meglio si è espressa in Italia la democrazia rappresentativa.

Il motivo per cui, parafrasando l'autore, il Mezzogiorno non è un posto simile a certi Stati della coca sudamericani, è che la mafia ha sempre agito da Stato in vece dello Stato al sud. Nel bene o nel male, la mafia era la legge - la vera legge, che i meridionali hanno sempre rispettato. E' questo rispetto che alla mafia dava e dà legittimità.

Se la mafia smette di fare lo Stato, e di occuparsi e di garantire i propri ""cittadini"", si creerà (e parzialmente già si è creato) un pericolosissimo vuoto di potere. [Quello che è successo a Napoli nell'altro articolo](http://video.repubblica.it/edizione/napoli/lite-per-spostare-il-gonfalone/146836/145353) è un sintomo a mio avviso importante del cambiamento, di una popolazione che si sente tradita dal ""suo"" stato.

The Chemist General said that they propose saliva testing for cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines, with a follow-up blood test if the saliva testing is positive, both requiring equipment which the police currently does not own.

The defence made the case that their client wanted to intimidate the deceased to stop him from demanding a sexual relationship, and that he never intended to use lethal force.

In any case, if you're a student, the tax is much lower than the normal price, but the tax administration have to know that you're a student so that's to be cleared up with the landlord. You can also call directly the administration, but I don't know possible that is in English.

As I said, if you want to save the trouble, a solution is to talk about it with the landlord. You don't need to start off with the idea that you're going to screw him before you even meet the guy. Ask him how he plans to make it work. If he tells you he wants to make you pay the whole year, negotiate with him. You can move in on the second (so don't have to pay anything), he can refuse to rent you the place if you do that.

Our blanket guarantee sucked deposits out of other countries' banks at a time when they were all suffering instability due to loss of deposits. The reason that most of Europe followed us in introducing bank guarantees was to offset the effects of ours on their banks, and the reason, as far as I can make out, why our government didn't consult with anyone before introducing our blanket guarantee was to get the drop on them.

If you want to know why our government isn't somehow able to get whatever it wants from the rest of the EU because we ""saved their banks"", it's because the only thing we ever saved their banks from was us.

Fortunately, things have settled down somewhat since then - we've agreed to play nicely with the other kids, and they've agreed to play nicely with us. But in the early days of the crisis, pretty much every European government reacted selfishly, and it took time for everyone to accept that joint solutions were better solutions.

EGDL sta dicendo, in brutale sintesi, che coi parlamentari di una volta (cioè eletti con la preferenza multipla) certi scempi mai sarebbero passati lisci perché loro sì che avevano a cuore le istanze del territorio. Sottotesto: rapporto diretto eletto/elettore &gt; eletto proveniente da chissà dove e messo lì dalla segreteria.

Ora, di tutti gli esempi che si possono portare a sostegno della tesi, quello della classe dirigente campana dell'ultimo quarto del ventesimo secolo mi sembra davvero il meno indicato. Se non altro perché si tratta della stessa gente che, poco dopo, avrebbe effettivamente fatto ""a dir poco l’ira di dio"" in occasione della ricostruzione dopo il terremoto, e i risultati li sappiamo.

Più in generale, il discorso per cui la politica perde contatto col territorio per colpa del Porcellum è disonestissimo. Due motivi. 1) Il mito del paracadutato da Roma è largamente sopravvalutato: alla fine col gioco delle opzioni la maggior parte di chi entra nelle varie circoscrizioni è gente del partito locale (poi c'è sempre il quadro di lungo corso che rimane inculato perché l'ex ministro opta per la regione sua e allora tutti gli fanno l'intervista e tutti ci scandalizziamo. Il fatto che questo succeda in due o tre regioni e nelle altre diciassette o diciotto no passa generalmente inosservato). 2) Soprattutto, si rimpiange la stessa esatta cosa - cioè l'intimo legame tra eletto e suoi elettori - che sull'onda della sacrosanta indignazione popolare abbiamo abolito mediante plebiscito stantene la conclamata perversità (vedi alla voce ras che controllano le clientele sul territorio e voto di scambio e mafia e camorra e tutto il resto). Tanto per fare un esempio, questo fenomeno che oggi ci  viene a fare il piantino sulle preferenze perdute è lo stesso fenomeno che vent'anni fa si sdegnava perché c'era [un nocciolo duro di malaffare politico e corrotta intrinsichezza con la proporzionale, che ha il suo epicentro nei due principali partiti delle vecchie maggioranze (Dc e Psi) ed e' sufficientemente forte in Parlamento ed altrove per tentare una battaglia di resistenza contro il cambiamento](http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/maggio/01/non_perdere_altro_tempo_co_0_9305018707.shtml)

Per questo mi incazzo quando la gente butta il Porcellum in mezzo a tutto. Non perché è una legge bella o brutta o giusta o sbagliata. Perché ormai il Porcellum è diventato un jolly col quale sostieni qualsiasi cosa e sei sicuro di fare bella figura perché ti pare che qualcuno si permette di non convenire almeno su quanto fa schifo il Porcellum. Mentalità subdola, perché ti impigrisce al punto di farti arrivare a sostenere che il Porcellum sia ""espressione e conseguenza"" della scalata della mafia al potere (cosa che, perdonami la brutalità, non ha senso) e, nei casi peggiori come quello di EGDL, ti porta a fare figure di merda del genere

EGDL sta dicendo, in brutale sintesi, che coi parlamentari di una volta (cioè eletti con la preferenza multipla) certi scempi mai sarebbero passati lisci perché loro sì che avevano a cuore le istanze del territorio. Sottotesto: rapporto diretto eletto/elettore &gt; eletto proveniente da chissà dove e messo lì dalla segreteria.

&gt; Ora, di tutti gli esempi che si possono portare a sostegno della tesi, quello della classe dirigente campana dell'ultimo quarto del ventesimo secolo mi sembra davvero il meno indicato. Se non altro perché si tratta della stessa gente che, poco dopo, avrebbe effettivamente fatto ""a dir poco l’ira di dio"" in occasione della ricostruzione dopo il terremoto, e i risultati li sappiamo.

Io personalmente credo sia invece molto indicato. Quello che è successo in Campania, nel silenzio della popolazione, è potuto succedere appunto *grazie* al silenzio della popolazione. Una popolazione che si è sempre ""fidata"" della classe dirigente, credendo che la classe dirigente facesse appunto il loro interesse (loro intendo i napoletani).

L' inerzia sociale ha dato 20 anni di tempo a questi signori per stuprare la terra nel silenzio di una popolazione che si è fidata. Ora la popolazione ha ""mangiato la foglia"". Napoletani che inculano napoletani (inceptiònne)?

&gt; Più in generale, il discorso per cui la politica perde contatto col territorio per colpa del Porcellum è disonestissimo. 

Più che disonesto è shortsighted (perdonatelo a me che parlo sempre come mangio ma non trovo un termine italiano più adatto). Il porcellum è una conseguenza, non una causa. 30 anni fa sarebbe stata la ""base"" della mafia a rivoltarsi - ora, il distacco tra mafie e popolazioni è evidente, e quindi anche qualcosa come il porcellum passa sotto silenzio. Come che so, Bersani che dice qualche giorno fa con Letta che di fatto era già tutto deciso prima delle elezioni che si sarebbe fatto il governo con Berlusconi e non lo si è detto ovviamente per paura di perdere voti. Immagina Berlinguer a fare un discorso del genere. E' un segnale del fatto che tra il palazzo e la base non c'è più contatto.

Che ci sia oggi il porcellum, che tutti dicano di non volerlo, e che tutti alla fine se lo tengano è solo una conseguenza del fatto che il potere oggi sente di non dover più rendere conto alla base. Le conseguenze di questo le vedremo nei prossimi anni. Sta di fatto che il porcellum in sè e per sè è solo il fenomeno - il noumeno va ricercato altrove, le cause sono storiche.",0,1384698598,null,0,false,0,cdgcpc0,t3_1qti9b,t1_cdgcpc0,t1_cdgcczz,null,1428624433,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

**What is your ethnic background**: White, lived in a small residential area in West france.

**Which area do you live in**: French Riviera

**How often do you listen to French hip hop**: sometimes

**Who is your favourite French hip-hop artist**: IAM

**What does hip hop mean for you**: Rap was my first conscious choice of music, since I listened to  Skyrock's ""Planete rap"" (major rap radio station) every night before bedtime (instead of other station). I was far for their experience of *banlieue* but I liked the flow (I didn't really understand the whole context of the lyrics)

**What do you think it is about hip hop that attracts youths**: Some bands reflects youth because they are young (bands like 1995, or Sexion d'Assaut) and basically grew up in the past 20 year. Some other are more like older brothers, who have seen the same things when younger, but are now more mature about their lyrical content and experience (IAM, NTM). They all reflects what it is to grew up in a difficult social environment.

**Do you think French hip hop reflects sociocultural issues**: apart from ""Gangsta rap"", the analysis of any rap song can give hints of what they're experiencing in daily lives. Some artists are just more aware of it, and translate it better in lyrics.

**What French rap songs do you think exemplify the concerns of the youths today** ? I don't really know about today, since I mostly listen to older stuff. 

**What are they talking about?** Unemployment and concern over french security policy I guess ?

**Do you think French rap is political?** Well, NTM and IAM were sued for lyrics, so definitely.

**Rappers such as Youssoupha, Keny Arkana and Kery James are considered to be political. What do you think of these rappers and their music/lyrics**: I mostly listened to Youssoupha 2 last albums, and they're great because they embrace more than just *banlieue*. He talks about his father, black people history, the world, and what he feels France is becoming. There is definitely a political content.

**Have you ever felt issues such as oppression, marginalization and inequality** : Luckily for me, absolutely not. Yet I think I looked for a certain connection with troubled youth, as a way of understanding their thinking and thus later acts, good (graffiti, rap) or bad (violence, aggression...)

**What issues do you think are most pertinent to youths today**: As said, unemployment seems to be one of the major issue of youth, and France as well.

**Do you think hip hop is a good platform for expression**: Apart from ""political rap"", a place exists for other rap. Grand corps malade's slam is a good example of a spin-off. But my most prized discovery is Psykick Lyrikah : lyrics are not far from poetic, miles away from what you hear in french rap. Giving it sense is sometimes hard, but damn it sounds good thanks to their voices and a minimal approach on background music (not much of sampling, but actual composition). I'd recommend you to listen to ""Vu d'ici"" (available on Deezer and Google Music), it's something.

**Do you believe that the government listens to the concerns of youths**: I'm sure they do, but they do see issues as an abstract idea, sometimes even a statistic. Whereas people ""in the street"" see the real outcome of theses applied decisions.

**Do you have any other comments in regards to the role hip hop plays**: French Hip-Hop plays a major role in french variety nowadays. It's a good thing considering it was a bit of an outsider 15 years ago. Every sub-genre of US rap I know is equally represented by french artists, so everyone can find its deal.

**Addendum**

I now see I didn't say anything about something I'd call ""Loser rap"", mostly Klub des loosers or Orelsan. They connect with youth in a totally different way. They explain they don't come from a *banlieue*, but from different social environment. Yet they experienced concerns that young people had (growing up in a small town, or in a upper class environment) and translated it into lyrics and rap. Since I don't have a good step back to see the whole picture, I can't say much of their influence on french rap.

Also, I didn't say a thing about what I call Hip-Hop (which to me is the use of funks and soul sample). Bands like Hocus Pocus have a place in french rap for me, and some other like Svinkels are on the verge of it. Finally, some artists can't be really labeled since they vastly change in years : TTC's first album was quite an underground piece of audio, yet their last album includes a lot of electro sounds thanks to Para one's production.

The most interesting is the capital garbage strike:  the things got very bad. The municipality violating the strike laws hiring another company to remove garbage(actually a symbolic amount for Madrid 60 tonnes) the unions threatened with violence. 24 hours later(today) they signed an agreement this morning. [Link](http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/11/17/actualidad/1384658183_644591.html)

1. Nobody will be fired.
2. Wages frozen until 2017. The initial proposal was a 27% average lowering.
3. All the employees won't be working 45 days during the next 4 years when  they will be collecting unemployment benefits.
4. Any employee that leaves the job willingly will  get 30 days of salary by year until a maximum of two years. Even if the Spanish laws says that you don't have to pay to who leaves willingly they actually want to get rid of workers.
5. Any worker can leave the job for 5 or 10 years  getting a 50% year salary or a 75% year salary respectively. 
6. Nobody will be hired for replacing retires or people that leaves the company.
7. Probably nobody will  be prosecuted  for anything that happened  during the strike. (That's not not in the agreement but it's expected)

true,iSKill42,null,null,"&gt; Etwas ich will lernen, besonders von einem Deutsch Sicht, ist welchen Einfluss hat die deutsche Geschichte vor 1949 auf das politische System der Bundesrepublik nach 1949? (Konkreter Beispiele wäre unglaublich hilfreich).

Die Einflüsse auf unser heutiges politisches System aus der Zeit vor 1949 sind enorm. Man probierte beim Wiederaufbau unseres Landes aus den Fehlern der Weimarer Republik (1919-1933) zu lernen. Deutschland installierte nach dem ersten Weltkrieg eine Demokratie. Diese war für die damalige Zeit sehr progressiv, da zum Beispiel ein Wahlrecht für Frauen eingeführt wurde. Die Verfassung dieser Weimarer Republik hatte jedoch einige Fehler, die es Hitler später ermöglichten sollten, die Demokratie auf legale Weise zu stürzen.

Da du nun aber nach konkreten Beispielen gefragt möchte ich dir hier zwei Beispiele nennen, wie die Geschichte unser heutiges politisches System mitgeprägt hat.

* Die Demokratie wurde im Grundgesetz zur Staatsform der BRD erklärt. Parteien, deren Idiologie gegen diese Demokratie ist, können vom Verfassungsschutz verboten werden. Dies war in der Weimarer Repunlik nicht der Fall.

 In den späten 1920er Jahren entstand eine schwierige politische Situation. Durch Krisen(z.B.Weltwirtschaftskrise) bekamen die politischen Randparteien(KPD(Kommunisten) und NSDAP(Nationalsozialisten)) viele Anhänger. Zeitweise hatten diese beiden Parteien zusammen sogar mehr als 50 %. Schließlich konnte Hitler die Demokratie überwinden. Bei der Gründung der Bundesrepublik Deutschland 1949 wollte man man mit aller Kraft verhindern, dass es nochmal eine antidemokratische Partei soweit schaffen kann. Deswegen wurde die Demokratie als einzige Staatsform festgelegt und zum Schutz dieser Demokratie durften antidemokratische Parteien verboten werden. Übrigens wurden seit 1949 zwei Parteien verboten. Zum Einen die Sozialistische Reichspartei (neonazistisch, verboten 1952) und die Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (kommunistisch, verboten 1956).

* Das Prinzip des Förderalismus wurde im Grundgesetz verankert. Nachdem Hitler die Macht übernommen hatte, machte er aus Deutschland einen Zentralstaat. Dadurch konnte Hitler alles zentral verwalten und somit seine Macht auszubauen, die Demokratie weiter zu beseitigen und einen faschistischen Führerstaat zu errichten. 

Da unser heutiges Grundgesetz vor allem auf der Verfassung der Weimarer Republik beruht, solltest du vor allem auf die Unterscheide zwischen WR und der BRD. Ich habe dir hier nur zwei Beispiele gezeigt, wie Deutschland aus seiner Geschichte gelernt hat. Falls du noch mehr zu diesem Thema lesen möchtest, würde ich mal bei [diesem](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundgesetz_f%C3%BCr_die_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland#Wesentliche_Unterschiede_zur_Weimarer_Verfassung) Link schauen. Hier werden alle Veränderungen gegenüber der Weimarer Republik aufgezeigt. Interessant ist außerdem noch das [Ermächtigungsgesetz](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erm%C3%A4chtigungsgesetz).

Das Thema, zu welchem du dich informieren möchtest, ist sehr umfangreich und komplex, aber auch interessant. Daher hoffe ich, ich konnte dir wenigstens ein bisschen bei den Anfängen helfen:)

Anyone can invest. Germans already pay 19.5% of their incomes toward the pension scheme. So yes, if they were allowed to reduce their contributions or not contribute at all they could almost certainly afford it. In some says the pension system probably makes it hard for people to afford retirement. 

There is a value to be placed on a guaranteed income. I am not against the pension system per se. It's important to understand the costs, however. 

I personally think at least a portion of the 19.5% employers and employees pay could go to a better use elsewhere. Such large support payments might not be necessary if people were allowed to invest this money in the first place. 

The current system will not provide any basic level of comfort in a few decades.

&gt;Libya was a coalition strike

Yeah dude, a coalition strike called for by Europeans, in Europe's backyard. But when push came to shove, Europe wasn't able to hold it's own and do what needed to be done by itself. America was reluctant to even get involved, trying to say it was only going to play a *""secondary role""* and *""lead from behind""*, which was god damn impossible given the inadequacies of the European militaries carrying out the operation and their inability to project power across the Mediterranean. 

[NATO Commander: EU could not do Libya without US](http://euobserver.com/defence/115650)

&gt;NATO Major-General Marcel Druart, addressing the European Parliament committee on security and defence on Tuesday (20 March), said NATO relied heavily on US military expertise on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

[NATO states continue to squabble on Libya command](http://euobserver.com/defence/32050)  

&gt;The US is keen to hand over the hot potato of Operation Odyssey Dawn command to Nato as soon as possible. Italy has also urged NATO to take the lead.

[Libya, Europe and the future of NATO: Always waiting for the U.S. Cavalry](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato)

&gt;America was visibly reluctant to get involved, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies.

But yes, eventually, we did help, thankfully in my opinion:

And eventually this evolved into more logistical and intelligence support, as well as Special Forces on the ground in Niger. In comparison, other E.U. powers have offered very little, which wouldn't be the case if they had better-funded militaries with the capability for actual power projection.

European military spending isn't so low because of fucking choice, it's because the United States, France and the United Kingdom pick up the god damn bill. And France and the United Kingdom are starting to make massive military cuts. You see what I'm saying here? And it just goes completely in the face of our overall strategic pivot to the Pacific &amp; Asia if we have to constantly assist Europe with regional peacekeeping missions. 

But no dude, you're rights, totes right. Another Srebrinca/Kosovo situation will NEVER happen again, nor another Mali one....and good thing nuclear weapons are the only deterrent a country will ever need, so you know, I'm sure that'll reassure your new Eastern European members who are still on the periphery of Russian influence, or potential E.U. Eastern European members who are still staring Russia down right now for stating they might want to join the E.U. *(talking about Ukraine)*. You're strategic and geo-political understanding is superb, in no way is it not well-thought out or able easily backfire.

La questione sta così: le carriere sono state differenziate per ruoli (truppa, sottufficiali, ufficiali) e gli ingressi ad ogni ruolo avvengono in due modi: direttamente (concorso pubblico per titoli ed esami, aperto a tutti), o indirettamente (concorso interno con posti riservati a personale già in servizio). I secondi si fanno sempre più rari, mentre i primi hanno generalmente cadenza annuale.

Al ruolo da sottufficiale si accede ormai solo tramite scuola o concorso interno, a meno che la MM non faccia eccezioni per la CP (chiedo e ti faccio sapere). Essendo un concorso per titoli ed esami ci sono alcune cose che possono portarti un punteggio aggiuntivo. Classici titoli (es. lingue straniere, titoli di studio) e competenze particolarmente affini al tipo di lavoro (da cui la cosa del bagnino) tra cui l'essere stato già militare in passato (meglio se in marina). Ma si tratta di 0,25 di punto a dire tanto...ciò che fa il punteggio sono gli esami.

Non so come stai messo, ma se l'età te lo permette e la motivazione è solida, scaricati il bando di concorso per la scuola sottufficiali. L'anno da VFP te lo consiglio solo se non riesci a passare in prima battuta e ti va di ritentare l'anno successivo.

Del resto, un telefilm come Montalbano è decisamente arricchito dalla recitazione originale, senza la quale perde molto del suo valore.

La stessa cosa vale per un telefilm come Breaking Bad: la recitazione eccezionale di Cranston viene inevitabilmente rovinata dal doppiaggio. Non sarebbe meglio, come fanno all'estero, sottotitolare in Italiano e lasciare il sonoro originale (cosí magari ci si allena anche all'ascolto della lingua inglese, che male non farebbe)?

But when push came to shove, Europe wasn't able to hold it's own and do what needed to be done by itself. America was reluctant to even get involved, trying to say it was only going to play a ""secondary role"" and ""lead from behind"", which was god damn impossible given the inadequacies of the European militaries carrying out the operation and their inability to project power across the Mediterranean. 

It was called for by the UK at the urging of Libya's opposition forces and supported by the US from the very beginning as evidenced by S.RES.85 and the fact that the US forces were already present in the region. The US might have seemed reluctant to get involved but make no mistake, they were ready to go from the very beginning. Europe joining was a happy coincidence. 

&gt;Alright dude lol Now you're just lying through your very teeth.

The US was more than willing to get itself involved in the Mali operation since, as usual, it had interests there that it wanted to protect. The French asking for help was just a courtesy, nothing more. 

&gt;And eventually this evolved into more logistical and intelligence support, as well as Special Forces on the ground in Niger. In comparison, other E.U. powers have offered very little, which wouldn't be the case if they had better-funded militaries with the capability for actual power projection.

We have no need to be the world's policeman.

&gt;Yeah, no, because you say, you don't pay American taxes, so you're not the one footing the bill here; I am. 

Feel free to stop paying taxes then.

&gt;European military spending isn't so low because of fucking choice, it's because the United States, France and the United Kingdom pick up the god damn bill. 

Maybe I'm mistaken but last I checked, France and the UK were both European. 

&gt;And France and the United Kingdom are starting to make massive military cuts.

Good. 

&gt;You see what I'm saying here? And it just goes completely in the face of our overall strategic pivot to the Pacific &amp; Asia if we have to constantly assist Europe with regional peacekeeping missions. 

And that's my problem because...?

&gt;But no dude, you're rights, totes right. Another Srebrinca/Kosovo situation will NEVER happen again, nor another Mali one....and good thing nuclear weapons are the only deterrent a country will ever need

Europe was more than capable of intervening in Kosovo, what prevented it was politics.

&gt;I'm sure that'll reassure your new Eastern European members who are still on the periphery of Russian influence, or potential E.U. Eastern European members who are still staring Russia down right now for stating they might want to join the E.U.

true,Ashimpto,ROMA,Romania,"Right. Thing is EU won't carry dead weight after it, most countries that came in the last decades saw that EU isn't all sugary and unless you have a decent-good economy you will probably only lose. Why? Because you'll no longer have rights to encourage any local production of goods and services, and ukraine (like romania, bulgaria and a lot more) cannot really compete with germany's quality/quantity/standards in any way. Which means they become a consumer country which in the long term is bad. Also, you need to pay  your contributions to the EU and the EU funds business is not as easy as it seems (most recent countries are still failing at them) so if you cannot absorb all that money you'll be a contributor regardless of your power.

For example see this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_statistics

By looking at it, you'd believe Romania is a net receiver. However that is wrong, that's the budget share assigned (potential money) and given Romania isn't able to absorb all the EU money, we're actually a contributor. And that sucks because we have no power to actually contribute, we really cannot compare ourselves to Germany, France or even Poland (who are doing a great job in absorbing every drop of money given to them).

And you'll say that Germany is at loss since they are top contributor to the EU, but that is wrong because they are also top exporter. For example, Germany exports way more to Romania than Romania exports to Germany. That means a huge flow of money goes on to Germany. I don't have any figures, but my common sense says EU is very profitable for Germany and developed countries who actually produce goods and are not consumer countries (like Romania or Bulgaria).

it's the official crime statistics report from 2012/2011 for Hamburg. Take a look at which areas are the worst and stay away from them.

'buy a house in' generally speaking, you will probably rent an apartment, but if your financial situation allows to buy a house...that's great for you ;)

As for the 'Energiewende', personally I didn't really notice it.

I've no experience with Car2Go, but you'd only need something like that if you've to transport something (and I'm not sure if Car2Go is of any help there since most of their cars seem to be those small Smart cars, given the great public transportation system in Hamburg, I've no clue why anyone would need a car, aside from hauling stuff).

Youtube: There are several add-ins for Firefox to get around it.

Before buying/renting an apartment/house check the area out at night (but be careful). Also try to get a hold of someone living in the same house (in case of apartment) or a neighbour (in case of renting/buying a house) to get some information about the area and other neighbours.

Check out the water quality. Due to many old houses the conduit system is usually old so even though Hamburg get's it's water from Lüneburg for the most part (and Lüneburg's water quality is one of the highest in Germany) the conduit system ruins it. This is especially important for your washing machine.

If you decide to travel via public transport, get over to the HVV's website (hvv.de) and get a subscription, it's much cheaper/easier than to buy a ticket each time. But only get that subscription AFTER you've your apartment/house. Since the HVV divides Hamburg into several zones and rings, you'll have to know how many zones/rings you need for your daily commute.

Getting your own car is not a good idea (at least in my opinion) you need to search for a place to park it (those are rare, given the amount of cars that are used in Hamburg) and since many of Hamburg's streets are one-way streets you can't just turn around if you missed a left/right turn.

I also am not sure where you are getting that improvements in productivity cannot go on forever as the data and history would show otherwise.

Je ne comprends pas la position du Quai d'Orsay. Pourquoi s'arc-bouter en refusant que l'Iran se dote d'une dissuasion nucléaire ? Considéré du point de vue iranien, c'est la seule protection contre les excités de la gâchette qui hantent les couloirs de Washington et les raids aériens dont les menace plus ou moins régulièrement Israël. Culturellement, historiquement, la Perse, ce n'est pas 3 bédouins assis à prendre le thé sous une tente. Même si l'Iran n'est pas une démocratie, c'est une nation avec des institutions et l'épouvantail Ahmadinejad n'est plus là pour servir de repoussoir à l'Occident.

Pourquoi ne pas considérer que, si l'Iran devient une puissance nucléaire, cela contribuera à stabiliser la région et réduire le nombre des conflits en armement conventionnel dans cette zone troublée ? Le scénario MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction) a eu un impact notable dans la résolution ou tout du moins l’apaisement de la Guerre Froide comme de l'antagonisme Inde/Pakistan.

Cela pourrait également calmer l'activisme iranien à ses frontières qui tente aujourd'hui de se former un glacis protecteur de pays où l'Islam chiite est majoritaire. Si son territoire est sanctuarisé par une dissuasion nucléaire, cela lui permet d'allouer ses ressources à d'autres objectifs, plus pacifiques ceux-là.

1. Nobody will be fired.
2. Wages frozen until 2017. The initial proposal was a 27% average lowering.
3. All the employees won't be working 45 days during the next 4 years when  they will be collecting unemployment benefits.
4. Any employee that leaves the job willingly will  get 30 days of salary by year until a maximum of two years. Even if the Spanish laws says that you don't have to pay to who leaves willingly they actually want to get rid of workers.
5. Any worker can leave the job for 5 or 10 years  getting a 50% year salary or a 75% year salary respectively. 
6. Nobody will be hired for replacing retires or people that leaves the company.
7. Probably nobody will  be prosecuted  for anything that happened  during the strike. (That's not not in the agreement but it's expected). 

BTW: the usage of emergency services for the cleaning was illegal. The public authorities hadn't declared a health emergency(i.e. due to the risk of epidemic outbreks). But the unions didn't follow  the minimum services decree(may be illegal also). But nobody is  going to send to court anybody.

Thirdly, the vote was the first opportunity given to voters to protest against Nick Clegg's betrayal of the social democratic wing of his party; a group which has a significant overlap with electoral reform.

Fourthly, the pro-AV campaign was disastrous; while the anti-AV campaign was well run (and well funded).

Scottish independence is unlikely to have any impact on electoral reform in the rest of the UK. However, there are two other promising possibilities.

a) Lords Reform, when it happens, will introduce proportional representatin of some kind into the House of Lords. This would put pressure on the House of Commons to follow suit or lose its legitimacy as the most representative House.

People who speak or understand no english are pretty rare, so an english speaker can always get by. However, if you can slip a ""merci"" or ""s'il vous plait"" or even just ""bonjour"" it will definitely be appreciated.

As to how hard it is, I think it depends.

*If nothing goes wrong* (i.e., according to the official schedule), the maximal interval between two RER B trains going to Roissy-CdG airport is 15 minutes, even at night on a holiday, and the longest it takes (starting from Luxembourg, which is the furthest where you would reasonably take it) is 42 minutes.  So you should be able to get to the airport, from any RER B station within Paris, in less than an hour, even on Christmas day, whenever you start.

On the other hand, the RER B is notoriously unreliable.  But if you add 30 minutes, so 1h30 total, you should be pretty safe (while the RER B is often late, 30 minutes late is really rare), especially since a major problem such as a strike would almost certainly be apparent on the way *to* Paris.  If you want to play really safe, make it 2h, which would give you enough time to find some alternate means of transportation (Roissybus, Air France coaches, or taxi) to get back to the airport in time.  You should add that, of course, to whatever margin you need to have at the airport before your flight takes off (e.g., to get through the security checks).",0,1384723894,null,0,false,0,cdgm5us,t3_1qi62q,t1_cdgm5us,t1_cdg6o0s,null,1428619949,1,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,1

Then there are other issues that deserve due consideration. Romania is not as rich as Germany and diverting resources towards bringing Moldova up to par would be much harder on the country. At the same time, the issue of Transnistria will have to be solved one way or another. Moldovans themselves are also not very supportive of uniting with Romania.

true,TuesdayAfternoonYep,UNSA,USA,"I'm in an area next to two very often jammed up traffic lights due to extreme and rapid growth in my area from when it was originally built (new construction has done an incredible job of helping it, though). My area is ranking #7 worst drivers with the highest collision claims and crashes per capita in the US.

After Hurricane Sandy, the lights were out for nearly a week until the local departments decided to put individual generators at the important intersections, but until then there were no traffic lights to guide the huge amount of traffic. I'm not sure why they finally decided to bring generators out to these important intersections, but I imagine it may have been from people complaining about it or some avoidable accident may have occurred (my area loves to change up intersections after accidents, which is actually working).

Similarly to one of the men in the video, I surprisingly felt it was faster driving that way. Less stopping, but everyone drove more slowly at lights. I kind of preferred it, but I assume it's only temporary until everyone gets used to new circumstances. Of course, we still have pedestrian crossings, stop signs, yield signs, and the like, but traffic lights have the strongest impact.

At what point does it become like driving in, say India or South America? We're all used to so much order while we're driving, taking it out temporarily seems to reap some benefits, but eventually, the order will decay, IMO. The order only lasts as long as people's patience lasts, and once you see others committing minor offences it will only grow, such as driving seen in Russia.

true,Up_to_Pizmo,toscana,,"Well, some advice based on my personal experience. 

1. I don't know about the UK, but in Italy you can negotiate *a little bit* on the rent before you sign the contract. Even if you can get a 20 euro discount it's still over 200 euro you are saving at the end of the year. You may not want to play hardball if you are very interested in the apartment and the price is really fair, but otherwise you may want to try. 

2. When I signed the contract, I paid 3 month's rent in advance for deposit. Plus the real estate agent's fee: if you are renting a house through an agent, always ask in advance how much their fee is going to be. 

3. Please be aware that the contract must be registered with the revenue service. You and your landlord will split the expense 50-50, by law. That is going to cost, in total, 2% of the total amount for one year of rent, plus (it gets weird here) 14.62 euro for each page of the contract, which you pay in marche da bollo (a sort of stamp that you buy at the tobacconist's before or on the same date that's on the contract - not after the contract has been signed or else you get fined). Oh yes, Italian bureaucracy is often absolutely grotesque. I guaratee you are going to hate it. But you are going to love everything else, I promise. 

4. standard contracts are usually 4+4, that is 4 years renewable for another 4 years. You can leave before the end of the contract, usually with 6 month's notice, even if often landlords will agree to letting go you sooner if you need to - and of course if they can find someone to rent to.  I know that 3+2 contracts also exist - if I recall correctly they are cheaper but I don't know much about them). 

5. There is usually a fee for maintenance (each person living in the building contributes to expenses such as cleaning of the common areas, etc). It is called ""spese di condominio"" or just ""condominio"": always verify that the price they quote you includes that as well. It varies a lot depending on the building, the city, and the area but it's usually not too bad.

* Polish economy did pretty well during last crisis (we were the only European country that avoided recession and we have the greatest cumulated GDP growth since 2007 at 19.7 per cent) and although there was a huge slowdown last year, latest GDP growth estimates were better than expected. We didn't have housing bubble here (or at least it didn't blow yet) but we have some serious debt problems, as 55% debt-to-GDP ceiling was achieved. 

* More. We have have multi-party system as opposed to US dual-party system but despite of that, our two largest parties literally hate each other. PiS (the more conservative one) is accusing PO (the less conservative one) of killing former president Kaczynski (who died in plane crash in Smolensk, Russia, on April 10 2010) and being betrayers working for Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin. They seriously believe that (as well as 30% of voting bloc), and they also believe PO's major goal is to exterminate Polish nation. So American petty argues about health care do not really impress us. 

* Depends how you define ""left"" and if you mean being left socially or economically. Socially, Poland has its Alabamas and our Californias or New Englands are less populated than the American ones. Economically, Poland is more left than the US but our nation and our politicians want to be more right and we are indeed gradually moving towards economical conservatism (which, ironically, is called liberalism in Poland). But I wouldn't consider our current situation as socialism. Polish people know well how much does socialism not work and after 1989 we moved as far from it as it was possible at that time. 

* Actually, he is a little. Polish people wouldn't consider his healthcare efforts to be socialist but the whole Democratic Party is leaning towards what was called socialism here (welfare state etc.) and Obama is like a landmark of that change. 

* It's free and no one is happy about it. Currently, 55% of each year's high school graduates go to universities so we have an absolute oversupply of gender studies specialists, masters of political science and business administration bachelors. Kids are spending the best years of their life in college and then they get a job at McDonald's because no one needs so much graduates. And at the same time, it is literally impossible to find a plumber.

Per quanto riguarda la sfida doppiaggio/sottotitoli, sono purtroppo convinto che il doppiaggio abbia più mercato della lingua originale sottotitolata. Se sono con i miei amici a guardare un film, quasi mai sarà guardato in lingua originale perché ""leggere i sottotitoli è faticoso"". E questo detto da gente di 20-30 anni che guarda regolarmente serie tv coi sottotitoli. Quando c'era qualche passaggio sottotitolato in qualche film, mia nonna leggeva un terzo della riga prima che la conversazione finisse. Anche lei non avrebbe mai guardato niente di sottotitolato. Mi faccio un paio di conti e credo che la scelta dei sottotitoli, qui e ora, perderebbe più ascoltatori di quanti ne trovi. 

Io penso che la soluzione migliore per la televisione, adesso che è possibile, sia lasciare la scelta della lingua in cui guardare il film e della lingua in cui mostrare i sottotitoli. La scelta anche della lingua dei sottotitoli evita a chi conosce la lingua ma magari non afferra il 100% delle parole la possibilità di errori nella traduzione o di elementi intraducibili. Ad esempio, questa è per me la ragione per cui non riesco a guardare niente in inglese con i sottotitoli in italiano, sono sempre a pensare che la battuta non sia stata tradotta bene.

Poi ci sono le scelte incomprensibili, come Rai 4 che dichiara che al 99% trasmetteranno lo speciale per i 50 anni di Doctor Who nelle due lingue, ma senza alcun sottotitolo. È un passo in avanti comunque, ma che problemi ci sono per trasmettere sottotitoli?

I just want to point out that the claim ""Accidents are now almost non-existent!"" is a **very missleading title** and at least a great overstatement to put it politely.

true,balanceofpain,null,null,"Typischer Pispers-Müll: halbverstandene Zusammenhänge, Fehlinformationen, verzerrende Darstellungen, Vorurteile, dabei das Ganze so vorgetragen, als hätte er von alledem Ahnung.

1. Pispers: »(…) die alten Stasi-Kumpel, die sitzen noch heulend über ihren Karteikästen und jammern: ›Hätten wir die Möglichkeiten von heute damals gehabt, dann gäb's uns noch.‹«  Pispers unterschlägt hier, dass der technische Fortschritt nicht nur den Überwachern, sondern auch den Terroristen, Kriminellen und allen anderen stark geholfen hat.  Dadurch wird Charakterisierung einseitig zu Ungunsten der Amerikaner.  Dadurch relativiert er gleichzeitig die Verwerflichkeit der Stasi-Praktiken.  Gleichzeitig entlastet er den Einzelnen von dem Vorwurf, zu bequem dazu zu sein, sich mit vertraulichkeitssteigernden Maßnahmen wie Verschlüsselung auseinanderzusetzen.
2. Pispers: »Der Obama hat vor seiner ersten Wahl versprochen, er würde Guantanamo [Bay] schließen.  Das hat er nicht gemacht, also selbst jetzt, wo die im Oktober in den USA alles zumachen mussten.« Pispers unterschlägt hier, dass der Kongress bisher bei jedem Versuch Obamas, Guantanamo Bay zu schließen, die Bewilligung des dazugehörigen Budgets verweigert hat.
3. Pispers: »Der Obama, der macht nämlich keine Gefangenen. Der lässt die Leute jetzt direkt vor Ort über’n Haufen schießen in ihren jeweiligen Ländern.«  Das stimmt so nicht: Nicht jeder Terrorist wird getötet, manche werden gefangengenommen, wenn die Umstände es erlauben.  Darüber hinaus sagt (und versteht) Pispers nicht, dass solche Terroristen auf Grund ihrer Kampfweise nach dem humanitären Völkerrecht in bewaffneten Konflikten kein Recht auf Behandlung gemäß Kombattantenstatus (z.B. Kriegsgefangenschaft) haben, und dass man sich einem Luftfahrzeug gegenüber naturgemäß nicht ergeben kann.
4. Pispers: »Der Obama hat eine Todesliste aufgestellt, ganz offiziell.  Da stehen die Namen von den Menschen drauf, die die CIA weltweit über den Haufen schießen darf.  Ohne Anklage, ohne Rechtfertigungsmöglichkeit, ohne Verteidigung.  Nicht mal kurzer Prozess.  Und wenn Sie dumm daneben stehen, dann sind Sie Kollateralschaden.«  Pispers »denkt« hier in den Kategorien des Strafrechts, die – wie oben angesprochen – hier nicht zur Anwendung kommen.  Und auch die Tatsache, dass die Tötung unschuldiger Nebenstehender nicht per se ein Kriegsverbrechen ist, solange der militärische Nutzen dies rechtfertigt, würde Pispers selbst dann noch verschweigen, wenn er von ihr wüsste.
5. Pispers: »Jetzt stellen Sie sich mal vor, der Assad in Syrien würde so eine Todesliste aufstellen und abarbeiten lassen.  Da wäre die Weltöffentlichkeit außer sich.« Der Zusammenhang mit Assad erschließt sich mir nicht, aber Pispers meint offenbar, hier eine Form von Doppelmoral festmachen zu können.  Ihm ist offenbar nicht klar, dass niemand sich auch nur einen Scheißdreck dafür interessiert hat, als Assad die friedlichen Proteste gegen sein Regime im Zuge des Arabischen Frühlings mit dem Militär über Monate hinweg zusammengeschossen hat, und dass diese Indifferenz nicht geringer sein dürfte, wenn Assad seine Gegner plötzlich mit Drohnen zu töten begänne.
6. Pispers: »Und die Informationen, die der Obama braucht für sein Terroristeneuthanasieprogramm, diese Informationen, die beschafft ihm die NSA.« Diese Aussage ist sowohl falsch als auch widerlich.  Falsch ist sie deshalb, weil die NSA nicht dediziert Informationen für die Disposition Matrix sammelt, da dies Aufgabe von CIA, NCTC und JSOC ist.  Pispers hat offenkundig keine Ahnung von den verschiedenen Rollen der einzelnen Geheimdienste der USA.  Widerlich ist sie deshalb, weil das Wort »Terroristeneuthanasieprogramm« die USA in die Nähe der Nazis zu rücken versucht.  Dies eine Manifestation deutscher Schuldabwehr und -relativierung.
7. Pispers: »Die Merkel konnte ja auch nicht sagen: ›(…) Die wissen, weil sie mich so lange abgehört haben, so viel über mich, dass ich nur eines weiß: dass dieses Wissen niemals an die Öffentlichkeit kommen darf.‹« Thomas de Maizière ging davon aus, dass sein Privatmobiltelefon abgehört wurde.  Für Merkel dürfte dasselbe gelten, obwohl sie wohl eher die Chinesen und die Russen im Verdacht gehabt haben wird.  Es wäre auch naiv, anderes zu erwarten, weil Mobiltelefone naturgemäß leicht abzuhören sind.  Unwahrscheinlich ist, dass an solchen Telefonen potenziell Kompromittierendes beredet wird.  Pispers scheint außerdem nicht zu begreifen, dass es in Deutschland mehr als nur einen Verfassungsschutz gibt, und dass seine Andeutungen, wenn überhaupt, eher gegen den thüringischen Verfassungsschutz gerichtet sein müssten.
8. Pispers: »(…) wenn Sie die demokratische Öffentlichkeit ehrlich darüber informieren, was zum ihrem Schutz geschieht, dann müssen Sie Asyl suchen beim lupenreinen Demokraten Putin, es sei denn, Sie haben Interesse an einem tödlichen Autounfall, oder sie wollen den Rest ihres Lebens als Staatsfeind Nummer eins in einem wunderbaren amerikanischen Gefängnis eine Spezialbehandlung erleben.«  Diese Äußerung ist mit die dümmste in der ganzen Tirade.  Die Öffentlichkeit hat gar nicht das Recht darauf, alles zu wissen, denn staatliches Handeln wäre sonst gar nicht möglich.  Und jede Regierung verkäme zu Blödeltruppe, wenn sie gegen Verräter von Geheimnissen nicht vorginge.  Eine mögliche Herangehensweise wäre die Schaffung einer dem Parlament untergeordneten Instanz, an die sich Geheimdienstmitarbeiter bei Missständen wenden können, wenn die Dienstaufsicht ihrer Meinung nach versagt.  Das konnte man auch ohne NSA-Affäre verstehen, wenn man es denn gewollt hätte.  Aber man wollte nicht, weil es anstrengend ist.  Man kann an den Reaktionen auf das Bekanntwerden der NSA-Affäre sehen, dass der überwiegende Teil der Bevölkerung dem Thema gleichgültig gegenübersteht, und dass diese fortwährende, von gelegentlichen Empörungsstürmen unterbrochene Gleichgültigkeit das eigentlich Verwerfliche ist.  Die Insinuationen, die Amerikaner würden Edward Snowden nicht nach rechtsstaatlichen Grundsätzen für seine Gesetzesbrüche aburteilen, bedient anti-amerikanische Ressentiments.  Ich habe bereits an anderer Stelle geschrieben, dass für Snowden das maximale Strafmaß nach derzeitigem Stand bei 30 Jahren Haft liegt, und dass es bei einer Verurteilung auf weniger hinauslaufen würde.
9. Pispers: »Der eigentliche Skandal an der Sache ist doch, dass unsere Medien sich mehr aufregen, wenn der Obama Merkels Handy abhören lässt, als wenn er weltweit zum Teil unschuldige Menschen über’n Haufen schießen lässt.«  Die Worte »zum Teil« wirken deplatziert, wie ein Überbleibsel abgewürgter Reflexion.  Es scheint so, also ob er im Grunde erkennt, dass seine Einwand nicht trägt, da er um die Hintergründe dieser Drohnenschläge weiß, er aber *dennoch* wider seinen Verdacht daran festhält.  Ich wüsste von Pispers wirklich gerne, wie seiner Meinung nach mit Terroristen von al-Qaida zu verfahren wäre.

If a universal unconditional minimum wage was installed it would be no great difference to the current system in most EU countries.

You just have to fill out *loads* of paper work for it and deal with loads of bureaucracy.

Still, he does get a little more on point after the first couple of paragraphs.

I also thought it interesting because his rant about useless self-serving EU politicians and bureaucrats really shares much of the same language that you normally get from Euroskeptic populists like Nigel Farage.
