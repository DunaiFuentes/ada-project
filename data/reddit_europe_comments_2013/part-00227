On election day, head to where you card tells you to go. Go up to your table, don't give them cake, don't bribe them, don't flash your breasts, just give them your voters card to get the list of candidates you can vote for.

Once inside the booth, go over the list, and either vote for a party or a single candidate. Just put a single X, not two, not a penis, nothing else than a single X. (Or you can vote blank and not leave an X, your choice).

It wouldn't matter even if there were just a thousand people. If they decided to go on the streets to protest then this issue deserves due consideration.

&gt;Maybe Romania is showering them with candies and everyone gets a golden balloon but it doesn't matter, because these people want autonomy and they say it out clearly. You can continue to claim that they have perfect rights and that Romania follows all conventions and everyone is guaranteed everything but that is obviously not true if you have people demanding more rights.

This protest has nothing to do with culture and language, these two things are not restricted and the hungarian community can practice them freely. It was more about taxes than anything else.

&gt;That's a false policy because the referendum would obviously be held on the territory of the whole country and the majority will reject it. 

That's not what I was suggesting.

&gt;I've read it somewhere a few days ago. I searched for it and couldn't find the exact article, but I think it was this map: http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hu&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ferdelyi-szovetseg.hupont.hu%2F9%2Froman-terv-szekelyfold-feldarabolasara-es-beolvasztasara

That map was proposed by a single nationalistic USL MP two years ago and has received no attention since then. The regionalisation project is based on the Romanian developmental regions created to help gestionate the use of EU funds so if it does happen it won't deviate that much from them.

i just think we're better off in the face of adversity together than separate. the media all day is trying to separate us. in madrid they say terrible things about catalunya and in catalunya the same is said about the rest of spain. it has come to the point where many catalunyans refer to anyone west of them as dirty castilians, even if you are asturian or galician. then there are psychos in madrid who think catalan is a dialect of castellano. theres so much delusion around, it's ridiculous.

Nicht nötig, das Deutsch ist gut. *""Demokrater""* als Parteimitglieder sind im Deutschen, wie im Englischen, *""Demokraten""*. 

&gt;Es ist ein Fehler, denke ich, alle Republikaner zusammen zu gruppieren

Gewiss, doch leider war z.B. das Verhalten des von Republikanern dominierten Repräsentantenhauses in den letzten Wochen nicht so, daß man ihnen allen politische Vernunft und Gemeinsinn unterstellen möchte. 

Und wenn dann ausgerechnet der Vorsitzende des Geheimdienstausschusses öffentlich so einen haarsträubenden, selbstgerechten, geschichtswidrigen Unsinn erzählt, im Brustton der Empörung…dann denkt man sich hier drüben eben, daß die Republikaner ein Haufen gefährliche Narren sind. 

&gt;Der Titel dieses Beitrags sieht so aus, als ob alle Amerikaner so denken, aber es ist nur die Meinung einiger Leute.

Leider ist es so, das der demokratische Präsident Obama viele in ihn gesetzte Hoffnungen nicht erfüllt hat. Mehr Abschiebungen, mehr Drohnenangriffe, und leider wurden auch befreundete Nationen weiter ausspioniert.  

Es scheint, egal welche Administration an der Macht ist, die Bürokraten von Homeland Security setzen einmal begonnene Programme einfach fort. Vielleicht fehlt es hier an der effektiven Aufsicht?

Ich weiß wirklich keinen Grund, warum die NSA die Telefongespräche der Kanzlerin abhören soll. 

Liest man die Diplomatic Cables von Wikileaks, dann wird offensichtlich,  daß deutsche Politiker ohnehin ihren Mund nicht halten können, und amerikanischen Botschaftsangehörigen selbst den letzten peinlichen Polit-Klatsch noch brühwarm erzählen.

I testimoni oculari della Resurrezione in Palestina erano comunque poco più di una dozzina. Se consideri i dodici apostoli che però erano undici a causa della *defezione* di Giuda, Maria la madre di Gesù e le donne che lo seguivano. La manifestazione pubblica della prima Chiesa c'è stata nel giorno della Pentecoste (il miracolo delle lingue) mentre fino a quel giorno i discepoli erano rimasti chiusi nel cenacolo ""per timore dei Giudei"", come recitano gli Atti. Poi i dodici hanno iniziato la loro predicazione e questo li ha portati in giro per tutto il mondo. C'era però anche una comunità Cristiana a Gerusalemme (retta da Giacomo, se non ricordo male). Era particolarmente difficile che il Cristanesimo attecchisse in un territorio a maggioranza Ebraica, principalmente perché il Cristianesimo ribalta l'idea del messianismo proprio dell'ebraismo.

&gt; le fonti saranno anche due ma non vedo molto la differenza

Ripeto: il mio passaggio sulle fonti era principalmente per chiarire.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Here's another perspective: the U.S. Constitution is very difficult to change because it is not meant to be changed unless a huge majority of the population agrees on it. 

Like ours then. It doesn't mean it can't be change. Just that one need several elections and a huge majority. Most countries have it that way.

However, most of us doesn't run around worshipping the constitution or speak about the people who wrote it like they were Gods on earth. I think that attitude is what really makes it so difficult to change it. Americans do not see it as a document, a piece of paper that every country has and need, but as something more. It is ""a legacy from our founding fathers"", ""greatest piece of legaslation ever written"", ""the foundation for our freedom"" and other strange things like that. 


&gt;I think you're confusing the Constitution with just our laws generally.

I mean both. In Sweden we had laws and/or constitution for example. I think in the 14th century they were just the same, gathered in a book. One didn't separate them in two ""different"" forms about structure and sharing of power until way later. I think they are about how one elects king and how much one is fined for murder for example.

A party can choose between two different models, unranked (side ordnet)  and a party list (partiliste). 

In either model, the number of seats a party gets is decided by the total number of votes that they get. With an unranked list, the seats then go to the candidates who got the most votes.

Amongst other things, this means that a vote for a candidate with no real chance of getting in, is effective a party vote. ",0,1382955083,null,0,false,0,cd18xk1,t3_1pd6uc,t1_cd18xk1,t1_cd18t39,null,1428956272,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

It matters very little of which activity receives praise and legalisation or which activity gets targeted for taxation. If all of that is a reason enough for you to vote, then you are most certainly a moron. It is true that only a fool would vote in these kind of conditions, believing they matter or make a difference, I reiterate, only a fool. 

I recommend you rethink your life instead of wasting a half hour or less on that rather peculiar meaningless after school activity. Just remember, not voting doesn't make you automatically apathetic as many ignorant people like to believe in order to justify their own participation in that meaningless activity. They are just protecting themselves and their beliefs, like humans usually do. 

It makes little sense to vote for something thats outcome is inevitably sealed way before the voting even takes place.

Democracy at it's finest. He was killed a few days before the election by an activist who hated his opinions and the amount of support he got.

Democracy depends on people trusting the voting system. Your little rant would only be true if people believe it to be true. It's a self-fullfilling prophecy. Politicians don't listen to me -&gt; so my opinion is insignificant -&gt; why bother voting. What you actually are describing is a lack of choice, which I agree is the absolute death of democracy.

If the Szekelys here don't see that he fought against the Hungarian revolution, for an autonomous Transylvania, for the emancipation of Romanians , and for a Transylvania in which every one has equal right and choose only to see that he killed Hungarians they refuse to accept this emancipation movement as Iancu is its image and say it was just a criminal killing Hungarians for no reason. 

The guys at this manifestation tried to be pro-Romania with messages like ""We are another face of Romania"" ""We are Romania too"" ""Autonomy not independence"" but if they keep this memory of Avram Iancu being bad because he fought the Revolution that didn't want to acknowledge the Romanian people existence in Transylvania they are just keeping the same anti-Romanian sentiment down there. There's never going to be friendship between these two people (in Transylvania because I think it's almost imposible to change the mind of the Romanians outside Transylvania and even *more* impossible to change the mind of the Hungarians outside Transylvania) if the Hungarians keep saying the Romanians are the evil because they fought against the revolution or the Romanians keep saying the Hungarians are the evil because they ""killed"" Mihai Viteazul. And without the support of the Romanians from Transylvania there will never be an autonomous Szekely Region. 

PS. I'm by no means defending the Romanian nationalists image on Iancu. Some Romanians consider him a national hero because he killed Hungarians which just as bad as the Hungarian image on him.

oh wow, ipende. Lavoriamo su turni e siamo un centro guasti, quind di sera/notte, salvo guasti, non c'è molto da fare e la nostra attività è affine a quella di un ufficio normale; sbrighiamo backoffice, seguiamo manutenzioni (fastweb continua a manutenere la rete - va detto che alla fibra ci tengono, anche perché è molto delicata), ma genericamente le notti sono molto tranquille.

Di giorno è un altro discorso; da NMC passano i dati dei tecnici che accedono ai siti Fastweb, ci occupiamo anche della predisposizione degli accessi presso i siti di altri carrier, forniamo upporto specialistico ai gruppi che seguono i clienti, abbiamo i capi alle spalle e quindi il lavoro è più serrato.

&gt; Quali sono i problemi più tipici?

Mah, numericamente DSLAM che si piantano per qualche motivo. Quelli più gravi sono i tagli fibra (di solito il contadino toni o il ruspatore bepi vanno di benna e tagliano a metà un cavo che trasporta dalle dieci alle duecento fibre ottiche: oh gioia) o le schede che si piantano sugli apparati di trasporto. in quel momento il lavoro ""ordinario"" passa in secondo piano e la missione diventa ripristinare il servizio ASAP mentre si comunica a chi è impattato l'esatto impatto, le tempistiche di risoluzione, etc. Questo con il capo del capo del mio capo che vuole sapere qualche dettaglio mentre tu stai cercando di capire dove di preciso si trova il casino incastrando i dati di cinque piattaforme diverse, appoggiandoti ad un database che è aggiornato ma non sempre. fun times.

&gt; Ho avuto un po' a che fare con fastweb e l'idea che mi sono fatto è che sono una mandria di stronzi (scusa OP), tipo che mi è arrivato il commerciale a farmi firmare il contratto anche se sapevano TUTTI che non c'era copertura, o che il call center mi ha messo giù il telefono (dopo 5 secondi) quando ho richiamato per disdire/sincerarmi che quel contratto fosse nullo... tu che sentimenti hai verso il call center?

Immagina la situazione di cui sopra. collegamenti down a iosa, impatti su tutta la customer base; carrier, clienti top, ospedali, vip, executive, chi più ne ha più ne metta. molti di questi hannoil numero dell'AD. Riceviamo una chiamata dal call center che ci dice ""EH O O DIECI CLIENTI DOWN A PORTO BIZZEFFE COSA AVETE COMBINATO STAVOLTA??"". Immagina la reazione. 

in FW i tecnici odiano i commerciali, che odiano gli amministrativi, che odiano i tecnici. ma come ovunque, credo :D

&gt;I'll give you one example from my country on why voting matters: in 2002 a rightwing politcian named Pim Fortuyn came out of nowhere and was about to win the elections. He represented a underclass of people who, since a long time, had their opinions voiced by him. Wether you agreed with his ideas or not, this was change from within, change by voting. Democracy at it's finest. He was killed a few days before the election by an activist who hated his opinions and the amount of support he got. This was change from outside, the revolution you are proposing.

That makes no sense. How is this supposed to prove voting makes a difference? All I see is just simple form of cause and effect. No relevance to anything changing. 

&gt; Politicians don't listen to me -&gt; so my opinion is insignificant -&gt; they don't listen to me -&gt; why bother voting. 

I wasn't talking about someone being disappointed by losing. I was talking about change resilience from the system itself. And considering political system is a tool of the system, making the whole process essentially meaningless and an illusion.

Let me ask you this: If you really believe that voting matters, then why are you enforcing precautions on your so called ""politicians""? Why not give them an absolute power? It makes no sense to restrain them if they are only things that can bring change in this world, in a so called democracy.

EDIT: I figured it would be nice to talk about revolution as well, since you brought it up here: *""This was change from outside, the revolution you are proposing.""*

Lets look it this way and consider for a second what a true change really means to a society.

Revolution changes things, not some sort of controlled subsystem of a bigger system, in that case a political system. Revolution has always been one and only true change in an established systems, such as ours now, however it doesn't necessarily mean it always will be.

Revolution happens only if an established system doesn't let itself evolve further and brings forth a stagnation and in order to circumvent that kind of control there has to be a revolution. Naturally, everything evolves and you are an ignorant to believe that your little system even stands a chance of survival. It makes no sense for an *established* (do you even understand what it means?) system to even involve a thing called change. It also makes no sense to believe an administration process (i.e new legislation/patches to prolong survivability of the system) is relevant change for a society, it is only relevant connection to the system's survival and has nothing to do with well-being of society. 

If you are so against revolution, then perhaps next time don't design an established system. Perhaps next time you ought to consider an emergent society an option instead.

They see him as a murderer because of the massacres.

&gt;If the Szekelys here don't see that he fought against the Hungarian revolution, for an autonomous Transylvania, for the emancipation of Romanians , and for a Transylvania in which every one has equal right and choose only to see that he killed Hungarians they refuse to accept this emancipation movement as Iancu is its image and say it was just a criminal killing Hungarians for no reason. 

The Transylvania Iancu envisioned is not the same Transylvania you do. Numerous villages were assaulted and massacred by Romanians during the Revolution. Do you believe those ethnic tensions would have subsided if Romanians were granted their own estate? 

&gt;The guys at this manifestation tried to be pro-Romania with messages like ""We are another face of Romania"" ""We are Romania too"" ""Autonomy not independence"" but if they keep this memory of Avram Iancu being bad because he fought the Revolution that didn't want to acknowledge the Romanian people existence in Transylvania they are just keeping the same anti-Romanian sentiment down there. 

If you want to talk about the history of Transylvania in terms of ethnicity then I'll tell you right now: both sides are full of shit.

&gt;There's never going to be friendship between these two people (in Transylvania because I think it's almost imposible to change the mind of the Romanians outside Transylvania and even more impossible to change the mind of the Hungarians outside Transylvania)

What do you mean by friendship? The only major incident between Romanians and Hungarians in Transylvania happened right after the Revolution in Targu Mures. Arguably the current status quo is working. 


&gt;And without the support of the Romanians from Transylvania there will never be an autonomous Szekely Region.

They need the support of the major political parties. Unfortunately, no political party in the Romanian Parliament  has any interest in creating an autonomous hungarian region at the moment, not even UDMR.

di base non esiste un programma che monitori lo stato del cavo; qullo che monitoriamo è lo stato dei servizi su un cavo. Quindi ci basiamo su quelli per stabilire se il cavo sta bene o sta male. 

Il monitoraggio avviene su quattro applicativi diversi a seconda della tecnologia degli apparati trasmissivi (Alcatel, Adva, Siemens, Marconi); su uno stesso cavo possono passare servizi gestiti da tutte e quattro le tecnologie, più collegamenti in fibra (in cui il monitoraggio è ""l'apparato dall'altra parte è down? probabile taglio""), più link punto-punto. Un cav di questo tipo tecnicamente è chiamato *puttanaio di merda*.

Quello che succede è questo: va giù un collegamento, verifichiamo gli allarmi, ipotizziamo le cause, verifichiamo per quanto possibile. Di norma cerchiamo di risolvere tutto in-house; se il problema è su una scheda, le tempistiche di intervento sono molto più brevi che non per un problema su un metro di cavo per strada.

Stabiiamo che gli apparati sono puliti. raccattiamo un elenco dei servizi down, stando attenti a non infilarci roba a caso, correliamo i servizi tra di loro tramite il database dei cavi del mondo sotterraneo e ipotizziamo un cavo impattato. chiamiamo i colleghi di firba, gli diciamo cosa sta succedendo, eloro si attivano.

ovvero: chiamano due omini che con uno strumento del valore di circa 10.000 eypo vanno ad un capo del cavo, staccano un paio di fibre e fan partireun segnale luminoso, attendendone il ritorno. con lo strumento stabiliscono quanta strada ha fatto il segnale, confrontano la strada fatta con la misura di rilascio del cavo, e quando vedono che il segnale ha fatto 3km ma il cavo è lungo 5km, vanno al km 3 a vedere cos'è successo.

una volta li, tirano madonne contro il capocantiere (di solito è un cantiere)

liberano il cavo rotto, recuperano la scorta (un cavo con lo stesso tipo e numero di fibre) e iniziano a giuntare una per una le fibre con il sopracitato strumento.

finiscono, inguainano, smadonnano un po' di più aòl capocantiere.

verifichiamo, tutto ok, apposto.

questo è BEST CASE SCENARIO EVER. Normalmente mettiamoci che:

* il cavo non è quello
* il cavo è quello ma non riescono ad accedere al sito quindi misurano daun giunto intermedio
* c'è un cantiere ma è chiuso
* c'è un contadino che ara i campi col fucile e non li fa entrare
* è crollato un ponte sul po
* è crollata una montagna in liguria
* è allagata una sala ed è tutto da buttare
* stavano giuntando e a uno è venuto un colpo
* stavano giuntando e si sono rotte di nuovo le fibre
* c'è un incendio, bisogna aspettare
* è notte e non si vede un cristo
* piove e non si vede un cristo
* fa caldo e non si vede un cristo
* è su un traliccio
* è su un viadotto
* dei pirla hanno colato due metri di cemento sopra e bisogna aspettare la ruspa

Large portions of (the international consensus) of its territory is controlled by separatists, who in turn are basically controlled by the Russians.

They speak a Caucasian language and are Caucasian peoples. Which Americans think means they speak the same language family as all other European languages. Stupid Americans! \*smack*

You want more indifference. You think voting is meaningless. That is literally what you said in your first comment.

And I disagree completely. Voting matters, just look at parties like Die Grünen, UKIP, and even smaller parties like the Pirate Party or the Animal Rights Party that have changed policies and general approach of bigger parties to the public. This is a result of voting for these parties.

Like I said, not voting isn't a sin or a crime. I've not voted because I didn't feel represented. But that isn't an excuse or a reason to glorify 'not voting'. Not being represented during elections is a terrible thing.

Revolutions are bloody. To me, the only valid use of a revolution is if a system is corrupt, or to overthrow a dictatorship. Both don't apply to any western democracy.

if you get stopped by the police and do not have the special licence on you, they are allowed removed the dog and then if you do not have one at all or get one asap, they will put the dog down.

Mi piace in egual misura guardarmi un mostro sacro tipo Per un pugno di dollari o Wasabi. I film sono divertimento, quindi ci sta che se mi sento da Wasabi mi guard wasabi senza sentirmi in colpa, o mi guardo Almost Famous, o qualche musical el cazzo. Gli unici film che non sopporto sono i soliti Vacanze A... (che è un peccato, il primo vacanze di natale eraanche guardabile, tutto sommato piacevole).

Come sarebbe a dire che non l'aiuto?! no beh, probabilmente non l'aiuto perchè se c'è il sole rovente ed una testuggine sono probabilmente su un'isola deserta, ho bisogno di cibo ma non ho il cuore di ammazzare una povera bestia indifesa. o forse sono solo stronzo.

En gros oui.

&gt; Et le FN aussi... non?

Non. Les autres partis sont en train d'éliminer la base des militants. Il ne reste que des gens qui veulent des places dans telle ou telle équipe, dans telle ou telle liste. Ça n'a plus rien à voir avec des convictions, même à la base. Des commérages et rivalités dès le plus bas niveau que je déplore.

Le FN a une base qui au contraire ne veut pas être exposée. C'est plus un sentiment d'appartenance ou d'esprit de groupe et non des rivalités entre courants, des trucs de politique politicienne qu'on voit trop souvent ailleurs. Après, il y a des inconvénients, la base est très peu éduquée, et la réunion mensuelle ressemble à un cours avec les mots qu'il faudra ressortir le mois suivant. C'est très compliqué dès que tu veux rentrer dans les détails.

Sur le plan économique, il s'agit en gros de reprendre le programme économique de Dupont-Aignan en le simplifiant. On ne parle quasiment plus d'immigration d'ailleurs, sauf dans le cadre de manifestations ou d'actions militantes au niveau national. Je ne sais pas si c'est parce que c'est voulu, parce que tout le monde est à peu près d'accord, parce qu'on parle plutôt des manières de contrer les autres partis ou d'attirer l'attention des médias.

They used Putney high street (In london. With a high amount of shopping centers, malls and clothing stores) and came up with an average cameras per business of 4.1.


They then use this sample and extrapolate TWICE.


Once to get the number of cameras in the whole of london using registered businesses and the 4.1 average of one SHOPPING street in london. Basically 4.1 * Number of businesses in london.
THEN after some guestimation (Actual terminology used) they extrapolate again using population.
1 camera to 14 people. So entire population of the UK / 14.
They got all this from counting the amount of cameras on one street in london.


It's ludicrous.


For example it's like counting the amount of CCTV cameras in Bloomingdales, NYC and deriving the amount of CCTV cameras in a personal injury lawyers practice in abbott, texas.

As I said, junk statistics.

I wouldn't want to live in any different time period nor would I want to change anything in it. However, issue at hand is your sanity. I am merely trying to point out that your behavior is flawed and essentially you are insane. 

Seriously, though, lets simplify and analyze *your* behavior. You have a voting system that represents only capitalistic views of the world. Everything else is not being represented as your system cuts them off for variety of reasons, whether they are too immoral or too radical, it doesn't matter, I'm not talking about anything specific. Do you agree with anything I have said so far?

If you do agree, lets continue: so, you vote someone or something that is already filtered through and accepted as something that can't really bring forth any ""meaningful""  systematic changes to your society. Essentially anything that gets through are people with the same pre-existing views the system already involves. Thus, all the parties involved have the same views already with small difference here and there involving small issues like taxes and legalisations of certain items/activities. 

That is it, there is nothing more this political system has to offer. And to be frank, you are insane to believe this system has anything else to offer. Moreover, you are essentially voting individuals, not ideas, thus making the whole process very weird and unnecessary. Why not just introduce idea voting to your admin purposes. There is no need for any elections or campaigns. Argument is usually that regular voters aren't smart here, but c'mon have you taken a good look at people who are candidates. MOTHER OF GOD, it is hard to find less qualified people than that whole group of professional politicians. 

Okay, so we have established that this political system offers nothing different than just plain out capitalistic views, which makes me wonder. Why do you even vote? I mean really, if so little can be affected through it, why does it matter who the hell is in the office if they all have the same face. This is very core characteristic of an established system. Do you understand now why people call it **established** system and nothing else? It is established, because it can't be changed, at all. Stuck, stagnated and essentially never changing system. 

Just to be crystal clear, I have no political agenda here, I am only trying to hack the life by saving everybody's time and effort by simply ignoring the very presence of politics in this system. Why bother with a system's subsystem that was never designed to change anything. I'd go as far as to say we should just turn government into a computer by letting it do its calculations and far better admin work than any human mind could ever accomplish. Perfect, efficient machine, isn't it?

They can't. They have a debt/GDP ratio of 160 % I believe (or is it 170%). The have to do like Argentina or something.

&gt;Germany in particular will suffer greatly.

Germany will suffer more *because* they have tried to save Greece, but they will manage. Had Greece just defaulted immediately, Germany could have saved their own banks, they can afford it. However, they have loaned Greece money that they never will get back, not to mention that Greece owes every Euro country money, not just the money we see, but also through TARGET 2, several hundred billions. They have also aided the Greek banks. 

Personally I think Greece should have defaulted in 2009, this is just prolonged suffering for no reason really. Then they would have had their own faith in their hands.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"Household debt as a percentage of household income in the Netherlands is higher than that in Italy. Hardly frugal in comparison. 

Also, let's look at the statistics: I've looked at the data-set for GDP per capita at the NUTS3 region. Any region which has the code ITC* or ITH* is in the North West or North East of Italy, respectively. The first ITC that appears is ITC31(Imperia) and ITC14(Verbano-Cusio-Ossola) with a GPD per capita of 85% EU average. The first Dutch region to appear is NL111(Ooost-Groningen) which is 68% of the EU average. There are 10 NL* regions below 100% of the average (though the majority that are below 100% cluster to the mid 90%s, cf. ITC*/ITH* which cluster to mid-80s.) There are 6 ITC* regions and 2 ITH* regions below 100% of the EU average. 

It's kind of difficult to establish a pattern for the most productive ITC*/ITH* regions compared to the most productive NL* regions as they're very intermixed. There are 7 ITH* regions over 120% of the average and 2 ITC* regions over 120% of the average, there are 12 NL* regions over 120% of the average. The top two italian regions are ITC4C(Milano) at 179% of the average and ITH10(Bolsano-Bozen) at 146%. The top two Dutch regions are NL113(Overig Groningen) and NL326(Groot-Amsterdam) at 233% and 207%. 

In 2010 the North West region of Italy had a GDP per capita of EUR31500, the North East's was EUR30500. Vallee d'Asote was EUR33700 and the region of Bolzano/Bozen was EUR37000.  The Netherlands was EUR35000.

I think, broadly, you could say that the Netherlands and the North of Italy are about as equally industrious. Maybe the Netherlands is more productive on average in absolute terms, but the North of Italy isn't really that far off in purchasing power terms which is in agreement with seemone's point. Northern Italy's people are going to be better off than a large number of people in the Netherlands because things are cheaper and tehy're equally/close to being equally as productive.

You seem to be very much in sync with Cameron's message, you even said so yourself that you are okay with this kind of spying. I do apologize if I misunderstood and you think that spying on allies is actually not okay.

&gt;Anglo Faction? Really is this all it comes down to with you?

It was called the Five Eyes or something ... I forget. Those countries that share their heritage, history and signed a treaty saying they won't spy on each other. And won't sign such a treaty with other nations. Yes, the Anglo faction. But it's not all that it comes down to with me. Just when it's the topic actually. Like in this thread.

&gt; Britain as well as the rest of the western world is struggling to adapt and come to terms with the very rapid way technology is changing everything about how information regarding us is stored and transmitted. You'd have to be naive to think that anyone has it worked out. Germany used Trojans to gather information on it's own citizens, there are probably countless examples of an out of touch administration doing possibly immoral things with digital information.

You actually do have a point here. The problem is that since the basic infrastructure of the net started in the US they have a disproportionate inflence over how it works. That is very problematic in light of the fact that they use and distort the basic information network of humanity without much in the way of scruples. See the problem there?

My - mind you ad hoc - proposed solution to this was a compartmentalized network with a common neutral area as big as the current net. For anonymous social networking, activism, memes, new media, what have you. A truly open market. Preferably with the servers in Switzerland or Singapore - some accorded neutral territory. Not where the NSA and the GCHQ can walk into the building a physically access it. 

Now if a business transaction were to be concluded on the net the subnets of the countries/factions involved would create a direct and/or open source encryption sealed channel through either the common net or separate infrastructure and use that. No-one can spy from the outside. Good idea, isn't it?

&gt; I'm not going to address your comments regarding your dislike of the Anglosphere, what's the point? You sit here talking about how the UK thinks it's a superpower, probably because you have seen someone else say the same thing and thought it sounded good.

Now this is just funny how you presume to know how I know what I know. How delightfully meta. Again. You know, you are being kind of obstinate. However as this serves you well in evading addressing the actual geopolitical realities I guess I understand. I just wish you didn't waste our time with personal attacks.

First of all, AFAIK the regional nationalisms predate Franco's government by quite a lot so the issue is not a recent one and far deeper than it may seem at first glance. What I notice the most is that local cultures tend to surface far more often than a ""Spanish culture"" and everyone who isn't from the centre of Spain makes a visible effort to show how they're from a different region, even when it's entirely uncalled for. I hope this doesn't offend any of my Spanish bros but I honestly think that some cultures are closer to (non-northern) Italian than they are to some others inside Spain. Personally I know better than to refer to anyone not from the centre as Spanish, I always use Galego, Catalan, Basco, Valencian, etc for politeness' sake.

I don't really think the current situation is sustainable, it just creates more resentment as time goes. However any single part of Spain becoming independent would most likely cause a domino effect where every other region would want into it. What I really have trouble understanding is why wouldn't Spain transform into a federation? Maybe I'm being optimistic but I think that'd solve or at least greatly mitigate most cultural/nationalistic issues, Spain is far too big to be a unitary country.

tl;dr: IMO a ""Spanish identity"" is far weaker than the regional identities and the situation is further sliding in that direction; I doubt there's a fix without federalism.",0,1382981480,null,0,false,0,cd1g3de,t3_1p6c05,t1_cd1g3de,t3_1p6c05,null,1428952863,2,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,2

Not in sync with him as regards general mass surveillance,  but I don't see any problem with spying on the governments of Europe and the world in general.

&gt;It was called the Five Eyes or something ... I forget. Those countries that share their heritage, history and signed a treaty saying they won't spy on each other. And won't sign such a treaty with other nations. Yes, the anglo faction. But it's not all that it comes down to with me. Just when it's the topic actually. Like in this thread.

You seem to have chip on shoulder regarding the USA and the UK, you have come across as not giving a hoot about France taking part in cooperate espionage against it's allies or Germany spying on its own people. This isn't only a problem for the Five Eyes, we're just probably putting the most money into it due to A) the histroric importance of British Intelligence  and B) the fact that on of those countries is the only super power on the planet and can easily fund something massively bigger than anyone else. 

&gt;You actually do have a point here. The problem is that since to basic infrastructure of the net started in the US they have a disproportionate inflence over how it works. That is very problematic in light of the fact that they use and distort the basic information network of humanity without much in the way of scruples. See the problem there?

Yes I see the problem other nations might have with that.

&gt;My - mind you ad hoc - proposed solution to this was a compartmentalized network with a common neutral area as big as the current net. For anonymous social networking, activism, memes, new media, what have you. A truly open market. Preferably with the servers in Switzerland or Singapore - some accorded neutral territory. Not where the NSA and the GCHQ can walkk into the building a physically access it. 

That's not good enough for me, I don't trust Switzerland or Singapore any more than any other country. The internet is important enough to have truly dedicated neutral land to facilitate it's services in a neutral manner.

There's also the issue of keeping the internet free, and not allowing stuff to be arbitrarly censored by one government, that's a problem at the moment but any movement would further separate the law makers away from the public using it and their scrutiny.

&gt;Now this is just funny how you presume to know how I know what I know. How delightfully meta. Again. You know, you are being kind of obstinate. However as this serves you well in evading addressing the actual geopolitical realities so I guess I understand. I just wish 

You want to talk about something that's just your opinion on things, and one I see fairly often on here when the UK falls under criticism for actions. You're reducing international politics to a playground scenario.

However the scope of their spying is a magnitude lesser than in the case of the US and the UK (and Australia, and ...). Because of the infrastructure. Which we were talking about. Until you tried to derail the conversation.

&gt; The internet is important enough to have truly dedicated neutral land to facilitate it's services in a neutral manner.

We emphatically agree here.

Die Presse schreibt einen Skandal nach dem anderen herbei, Obama sagt dies, raus kommt das, jetzt müssen Folgen her, bla bla bla.

Die Politik fordert schwammig Konsequenzen, die Merkel findet das geht gar nicht, der Gabriel will nen Untersuchungsausschuss, bla bla bla.

Der Bürger ist empört das sich niemand dafür interessierte als es um ihn ging, aber die Merkel, ja das ist ja dann doch ne andere Hausnummer, die muss ja nun handeln, bla bla bla.

Und keiner rafft, dass hier wieder das selbe Schmierentheater aufgeführt wird, wie immer. 

Es wird nichts passieren. Es wird sich nichts ändern. Als ob die USA es für nötig halten die Überwachung einzustellen. Was sollen die dummen Europäer denn auch machen? Sich beschweren? Bitte, Onkel Obama sagt dann, dass er das nicht gut findet und es ja nun auch nicht mehr gemacht wird. Das muss reichen. Dazu fahren Geheimdelegationen(!) in die USA und stellen dort Fragen die geheim bleiben(!) und die Amerikaner müssen dann aber auch ganz ehrlich antworten und uns versprechen, dass sie mit dem bösen Zuhören aufhören. Ja ja. 

Es ist doch nur noch peinlich. Die müssen gar nichts! Wir haben doch keinerlei Gewicht oder Drohmittel. Niemand in Europa tut irgendetwas. Es wird nur gelabert und spekuliert, sich empört und Vorschläge erörtert, aber niemand tut. Auch. Nur. Den. Geringsten. Scheiß!

Die Presse labert Stuß, begleitet den ganzen Prozess mit einer sinnlosen Berichterstattung, der Bürger ist schon so gehirngewaschen, der blickt schon gar nicht mehr, dass man mittlerweile direkt vor seinen Augen offen Krieg gegen ihn führt und die Politik tut das, was sie am besten kann. Sie sitzt es aus, weil es dort niemanden gibt, der zu irgendetwas in der Lage ist.

Es wird nicht einmal diskutiert die Spionageeinrichtungen der NSA zu schließen. Was glauben diese Affen denn, was dort im Augenblick passiert? Natürlich schnorcheln die weiter ab. Die interessiert diese Debatte doch überhaupt nicht. 

Die ganze Gelaber ist ein Placebo der Politik und der Deutsche schluckt diesen auf anraten der Presse. Eine absolute Luftnummer, lächerlich. Wir sind kein Staat, wir sind Bücker für ausländische Interessen. Nicht einmal unsere eigenen Politiker schützen uns.

Solche Missstände wären zu früheren Zeiten Grund für Kriegserklärungen. Heute ruft die Merkel bei Obama an und fordert nicht einmal eine Einstellung, sondern beschwert sich. Wahrscheinlich nicht mal das, wahrscheinlich führte sie ein Gespräch wie ein Leibeigener der seinem Herrn gegenüber tritt.

Eine angemessene Reaktion wäre die Ausweisung des amerikanischen Botschafters samt Personal, die Polizei müsste sämtliche Vertretungen der NSA und all der Privatunternehmen, die im amerikanischen Auftrag spionieren stürmen, alle dort Angestellten verhaften und entsprechend des 2ten Abschnitts besonderer Teil StGB (Landesverrat und Gefährdung der äußeren Sicherheit (§§ 93 - 101a)) anklagen. 

Nach der Schließung aller Späheinrichtungen müssten sämtliche militärischen Installationen und Basen der Amerikaner in Deutschland geschlossen und sämtliches Personal des Landes verwiesen werden.

In einem weiteren Schritt muss gleiches mit den Engländern geschehen.

Gleichzeitig müssen sämtliche Angestellten, welche im BND und VS von diesen Vorgängen gewusst und diese unterstützt haben ebenfalls verhaftet und wegen Landesverrat angeklagt werden.

Danach müssen beide Geheimdienste zerschlagen und komplett neu aufgebaut werden. Diesmal mit BND Hauptauftrag Spionageabwehr und dem VS mit Aufrag der Kontrolle des BND und anderer staatlicher Institutionen auf massenhafte Grundrechtsverletzungen.

Danach müssen Schritte in die Wege geleitet werden, welche dieser massenhaften Verletzung der Grundrechte in Zukunft Einhalt gebieten. 

Als Anfang wäre eine massive Bereitstellung von Infrastruktur sowie Unterstützung für Projekte wir Tor notwendig, so dass zumindest deutsche User jederzeit die Möglichkeit haben anonymisiert mit erträglichen Geschwindigkeiten zu surfen. 

Mittelfristig muss eine komplette Infrastruktur geschaffen werden, die entweder ein deutsches Intranet beinhaltet oder jeden deutschen durch einen staatliches VPN schützt.

Langfristig müssen Bündnisse mit anderen Ländern geschlossen werden, die mit dem selben Ziel, dem Schutz der Bürger vor den USA, zu Werke gehen. Das wär doch mal ein Thema wo sich die EU positiv hervortun könnte. Was wird stattdessen gemacht? Man verabschiedet Richtlinien.

What are you talking about? The guy was a regular dictator, a textbook example. [Here's a relevant quote from Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannis_Metaxas)

&gt; After a heavily rigged plebiscite, George II returned to take the throne in 1935. The elections of 1936 produced a deadlock between Panagis Tsaldaris and Themistoklis Sophoulis. The political situation was further polarized by the gains made by the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). Disliking the Communists and fearing a coup, George II appointed Metaxas, then minister of war, to be interim prime minister on 13 April 1936, and the appointment was confirmed by the Greek parliament.

&gt; Widespread industrial unrest gave Metaxas justification to declare a state of emergency on August 4, 1936. With the king's support, he suspended the parliament indefinitely and suspended various articles of the constitution. In a national radio address, Metaxas declared that for the duration of the state of emergency, he would hold ""all the power I need for saving Greece from the catastrophes which threaten her."" The regime created as a result of this self-coup became known as ""the 4th of August"" after the date of its proclamation.

You mincing your words about Metaxas' status as a dictator is pretty reprehensible.

I'm studying CS, so it better be good. Never tested LAN, but WiFi is around 10-15 Mbit/s

- Palestinian terrorists were just the beginning (hijackings and attacks). 

- The *modern day* extremists and terrorists would never have had such an ""easy"" time motivating thousands of young Muslims if Jerusalem wasn't split and occupied.

- Yes, the post-colonial borders and later Western interventions would have resulted in conflicts no matter what.

- The huge numbers of stateless Palestinans in refugee camps were bound to create hatred and extremism! Foot meet gun.
 
- bin Laden &amp; Co would probably never have had much success without the conflict in Afghanistan between the USSR and the CIA. He sought to take Mecca and Jerusalem for Muslims.

- Even Qaddafi supported countless terrorists simply because of the West's support for Israel.

- The energy crisis of the 1970s was directly tied to the conflict with Israel.

Looking up Pide in Wiki you get redirected to Pita.  A wide variety of flat-breads fall under the Pita definition, including, apparently Pide.

I've had Gyros in Chicago, Boston, Cleveland, Donairs in Quebec and NB (along with the ubiquitous ""smoked meat""), and Doners all over Germany, Europe, and in London.  They are made by a variety of Eastern Mediterraneans including Greeks, Lebanese, Turks.  They vary by region and locally-  In Ansbach we used to get them on the way home from work around the corner from our apartment, but the very best I ever had was in a shop inside the Real in Ansbach.  All of these treats, whether you call them Gyros or Doners, were more or less the same, breads, meats, and toppings a little different from place to place.  You want to sell Doners in Cleveland, you call them Gyros, and in Germany, you call them Doners.

My original post was simply noting that the patriarch who died in Berlin was clearly not the inventor of the thing, which according to Wiki was first mentioned in Ottoman travel publications in the 18th century, when the meat started to be cooked on vertical skewers.

true,Mshotts,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Jon Stewart knows how to twist the knife. ""So you guys are all upset we're spying on you,"" America's most popular TV satirist told an imaginary European audience. ""But I just have one question: Have you met us? Meddling in your affairs for our national self-interest is kind of our thing."" 

The idea there is that Stewart is essentially saying nobody should be surprised. He's saying that the U.S. has a history of meddling in foreign affairs to protect self interests. That's not a defense of the NSA Surveillance at all. 

The next people Mr. Pitzke talks about are all connected to the government and the NSA and naturally they defend the program. Mike Rogers (Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee), Peter King (Chairman of the House subcommittee on Counter-terrorism and Intelligence), Keith Alexander (outgoing NSA Chief). So, forgive me if I'm not shocked by the fact that they're defending a program that gives them power and their jobs.  

Then, he talks about an editorial in the New York Times by Stewart Baker where he said ""Allies aren't always friends. That's just life and international politics. As German Chancellor Angela Merkel too knows quite well."" Is that really that unfair of a statement to make? Were the Western Allies and the USSR ""friends"" during the Second World War? Anyway, Baker worked for the Department of Homeland Security under Bush so he's not exactly neutral either.

Then we get to Senator Jeanne Shaheen who said the NSA programs had caused ""significant damage"" to relations with allies and that Americans have ""repair work to do."". She also said ""And I think we have hard questions we need to ask of the NSA about what's really going on in this program,"". Shaheen is the senior Senator from New Hampshire and was also the first woman in U.S. history to be elected both as a Governor and a Senator. She was also considered for vice-president by Gore back when he ran. Despite all this, her voice is ""drowned out"" according to the author. If only she had a more impressive resume maybe people would take her more seriously. 

This is a pretty shitty article. Plenty of dramatization and sensationalism. I particularly enjoy the headline: **U.S.** on spying scandal: ""Allies aren't always friends"". Really? The U.S. said that? It's funny because that's the exact quote from Stewart Baker's editorial (remember him?). I wasn't aware Mr. Baker spoke for the entire country and all 300 million + people that live inside it.

No mention of the uproar by average Americans? You didn't forget that our own government is spying on us too did you?

It would be much easier to take down the NSA and government surveillance in general if the ordinary people around the world work together instead of setting ourselves apart from each other. Then again, that's not as catchy of a headline as '**U.S.** on spying scandal: ""Allies aren't always friends"".'",0,1382990488,null,0,1382990703,0,cd1jwp5,t3_1pe3wf,t1_cd1jwp5,t3_1pe3wf,null,1428951029,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The question was whether it covered non-state military action against a state military (so rebellions, civil wars etc.). The Court found that it did, and while they didn't touch on it, the implication was that it would also cover state military action.

In fact, it would cover the threat of using force to ... say... destroy hard drives as a way of intimidating a section of the public (say people working at a major newspaper), as part of pushing a political or ideological cause.

The Court had some pretty strong things to say about the breadth of the definition (well, strong for the UKSC);

&gt; It is neither necessary nor appropriate to express any concluded view whether the definition of ""terrorism"" goes that far, although it is not entirely easy to see why... it does not. For present purposes it is enough to proceed on the basis that... the definition of terrorism is... very far reaching indeed.

Ce qui est encore plus bizarre est que les sommes prélevées dans la région devraient être inférieures à celles redistribués par l'écotaxe et consacrées a l’amélioration du réseau routier et ferroviaire breton. Donc une partie de la population, certains professionnels, auraient évidemment payés, mais les bretons dans leur ensemble auraient reçu plus qu'ils n'auraient payé.

1. The concept of individual Europe (as opposed to Eurasia) is pretty stretchy to begin with. The division between Europe and Asia is mostly due to Greeks dividing the world into three equal parts, and this was later used as basis for continents. There is no magical ""continent line"" in the middle of Istanbul. It's just an area where the land is a bit lower and thus water has flooded in.

2. We CAN talk about cultural spheres, but Anatolia (present Turkey) was part of both Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Byzantine and Ottoman Empire, all of which are very European indeed (the first three being the whole basis for European identity these days). Meanwhile, Iceland was unoccupied. 

3. So Iceland is part of Europe in the same way as Australia or Canada. ""European culture"" was exported there, it did not develop individually. 

4. On the other hand, the definition of continent DOES talk about continental plates pulling or pushing against each other. This line DOES go through Iceland as stated. The inhabited part of Iceland tends to be well on the North American side.

Google é cosí forte perché sa tutto di tutti.

*Une* enfant. Il y a pu avoir d'autres propos racistes dans cette manif d'une centaine de personnes, mais ça on ne le sait pas (à toi de me dire si le *Taubira tu sens mauvais* est raciste). 

&gt; Elle dit qu'elle l'a ressenti le slogan comme étant raciste, c'est son droit.

C'est en effet son droit de se couvrir de ridicule. Lorsque l'ancien président de la République subissait des *Sarkozy, t'es foutu, les Français sont dans la rue*, il ne prenait probablement pas cela comme une référence à ses origines hongroises.

&gt; L'amalgame est selon moi justifié puisqu'il y a même pas 3 semaines une candidate s'est vue virer du FN pour exactement le même genre de propos dans un photo-montage douteux.

Mais pas dans la même situation: je persiste à penser que comparer une gamine de 12 ans entendue au hasard au milieu d'une foule à une candidate aux municipales, c'est un peu léger. 

Cela sert juste à établir des associations probablement erronées, comme ""la manif pour tous se raccroche au FN"", ou ""Anne-Sophie Leclere fait des émules"".

&gt; Je me demande ce qui motive les gens à venir poster sur Reddit pour défendre du racisme et de la xenophobie aussi primaire et stupide, à croire que comparer des blacks à des singes c'est : ""normal quoi, chacun a le droit d'avoir son opinion"".

J'ose espérer que tu n'as pas compris mon post comme étant une apologie du racisme. Cette blague est raciste, répréhensible à mes yeux et par la loi. Ce qui me pose problème, ce sont les généralisations abusives qui sont faites dans l'article: à partir d'une blague éructée par un individu dans une manif d'une petite centaine de manifestants dans une ville de France, on parle du ""dérapage des anti-mariage gay"".

Si un verdict sur un mouvement qui a regroupé des centaines de milliers de personnes (mais s'est maintenant largement achevé) se base sur une très mauvaise blague lancée par une mineure, on se retrouve dans la même situation que lorsque qu'un débat d'idées politiques est réduit à un échange de ""petites phrases"" assassines.

France and Germany are petty little countries compared to the US. They don't have to worry about balancing multiple mutually antipathetic allies in every region on Earth.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; France and Germany are petty little countries compared to the US. They don't have to worry about balancing multiple mutually antipathetic allies in every region on Earth. Germany gets to play the sweet innocent milkmaid everywhere, while France can stomp around in North Africa and nowhere else. As for Poland, being invaded is usually a unifying motivator. It's easy to stay unified when you have enemies on all sides because everyone hates you.

Well, you would have less enemies if you stopped behaving they way they do. Have you apologized to Iraq yet about invading them for example? You lied about that btw? And, you know this thread started with Americans behaving like assholes saying that we should be grateful for your spying  - yeah, you are a really cool bunch...

&gt;That's not a lot of other countries, that's five other countries, and you have managed to cherry pick the five countries in Europe that haven't managed to have a civil war or a revolution in the timeframe we're talking about.

No, a lot more avoided civil war, but not war. It is sort of hard if you are on a continent with + 50 countries, including Germany, France, Russia and the UK to stay out of them. In North America you have far, far fewer countries, and you still have managed to be involved in more wars than some of us. But if you want to know countries that have avoided civil war - Ireland, Iceland, Portugal, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Albania, Finland, Norway, Malta, Cyprus (who was invaded) Slovakia, Romania,Bulgaria, Hungary and more ( a bit shady on the last, they are a few areas they argue about back and forth, but that can be seen as war then, according to your definition). So, if you definition is civil war - most countries have avoided that. Including Germany btw.They had a failed revolution in 848 and two world wars, but no civil war. Neither had Austria. So, the civil wars that you are so proud that you only had one -well, most of us managed to avoid that completely. 

&gt;I don't want a handful of Jacobins shoving whatever laws they want down our throats anyway. I'd rather legislation be onerous to pass, that way the final results are generally at least pretty popular, though the ACA is a notable and catastrophically unpopular exception.

Jacobins -what century are you living in?


In God's name, I talked about writing a constitution that would lead to more effective governing and a bigger chance of getting what people truly care about if you look at polls on the agenda, not what corporations wanted.  However, I really don't care if you deny your own problems, like low social mobility, extremely low on health care and equality, bad on education, biggest number of people in prison, ever no matter how you count, a lot of people living in poverty, people believing evolution is fake etc -well, I find that idiotic, but to each his own. 


But the problem is when your idiocy become our problems, like Iraq war, your climate denyingg, subsidising oil and leaving a climate footprint that is far to big or feeling it is a good thing to shake up the world market. I thought a more effective government could fix at least those things. Yes, you are right, you are bigger and more important and the fact is that you have managed to shut down your own government and being constant victims of the Tea Party would be seen as a problem in most other countries and something to deal with - but, to each his own.
