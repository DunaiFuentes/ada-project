true,miramarco,lurker,,"&gt; L'IMU è un di più, che non sarebbe minimamente necessario se quegli stronzi dei nostri politicanti accettassero di ridurre i propri salari e le proprie pensioni a dei livelli più accettabili.

Facciamo qualche conto. Sommando deputati, senatori e senatori a vita, abbiamo 630 + 315 + 4 = 949 parlamentari.

A questi dobbiamo aggiungere gli ex parlamentari in pensione. Sono di fretta e non ho trovato dati aggiornati: nel 2011 [ce n'erano 1464 + 843](http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio/pensioni-doro-tutti-i-nomi/2157568) = 2307. Qualcuno di questi sarà passato a miglior vita e qualche politico sarà andato in pensione. Possiamo assumere per ora che il numero sia invariato.

Abbiamo 3256 parlamentari ed ex parlamentari il cui taglio di stipendio/pensione dovrebbe portare [i 24 miliardi di euro previsti dal gettito dell'IMU](http://www.cgiamestre.com/2012/12/imu-pagheremo-almeno-3-miliardi-in-piu/).

Quindi bisogna trovare il modo per prendere 7,3 milioni di euro ogni anno *da ciascun politico*. Considerando che, fra stipendio, rimborsi ed erogazioni di partito, [un parlamentare riceve circa 20mila euro al mese](http://www.lapresse.it/politica/stipendi-parlamentari-16mila-euro-al-mese-1.106421), moltiplicando questa cifra per 14 mensilità si ottiene 280mila euro l'anno. Abbiamo sempre arrotondato in eccesso, ma siamo ancora lontani dai 7,3 milioni.

Risultato finale: pur *azzerando* gli stipendi dei parlamentari (o meglio, solo quelli legati all'attività in Parlamento), per avere gli stessi introiti dell'IMU mancherebbero 22,8 miliardi di euro all'anno, ovvero il 95%.",0,1359819181,null,0,false,0,c8837gs,t3_17qxga,t1_c8837gs,t3_17qxga,null,1431161089,11,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,11

You will not make women more equal in the eyes of their male counterparts in these cultures even if you remove one symbolic garment that shows their submission. The only thing that will change is the lack of that symbolic garment, not the attitude. The garment is just a symbol that carries little meaning.

As you suggested, the underlying problem can be focused on through various means such as education and discussion, perhaps slowly removing the sturdiness of their views.

And it's critical to keep in mind the difference between voluntary and forced gender inequality. If a woman is born into this kind of culture and can't really escape for whatever reason reliably, that is forced and should be considered a problem. If there is no choice, the oppression is forced.

Some people don't want to face that, so they complain about ""anti-Americanism"" whenever some lowly foreigner doesn't show proper deference.

The most likely result of elections will be a victory of the Democratic Party, but with a very small percentage of seats in parliament. So, if both the Democratic Party and the Five Stars Movement propose and vote it, it could pass.

The problem is that in the past many members of Democratic Party voted against laws proposed by the party itself which were against the Catholic Church position (for example about considering LGBT bashing as an hate crime), and the Five Stars Movement is a new party and is impossible to tell how much likely they are to actually follow their claims.

On the other hand, it happened that some members of Berlusconi's party expressed a vote different from the party official position in similar cases, so it's totally unpredictable if same sex marriage will be proposed and approved in the next years.

Cyrillic represents destroyed cities? Last time I checked, Cyrillic letters describe consonants and vowels in a very large amount of languages.

By using that kind of logic, Serbia could then perhaps ban Catholic culture because it ""represents"" WWII concentration camps and ethnic purges.

Also, about the writing issue; parts of Croatian history are written in early forms of Cyrillic. Gaj's Latin Alphabet was even created by using Karadzic's simplified Cyrillic as a template, mapping the letters one-by-one. It's not like Cyrillic is a totally alien phenomenon in Croatia.

And are the travel habits of Vukovar Serbs really important? The border was not there when they grew up. The local government should instead investigate what is making life so uncomfortable there for those that don't have the Catholic background.

To give you an example of this attitude, I have often seen a European make a comment about America, one of those typical criticisms about life in America, and how it is so inferior to the European way of life. I have had Europeans argue with me about work culture or experiences in America, when they admit they have never been in America, and I have lived here my whole life.

The top secret groups go deep underground, using hidden entrances all over the city. And they sometimes stay for days at a time, equipped with head lamps and home-made maps.
Street names are etched into the walls to help explorers navigate their way around the underground version of the city and some groups have even been known to throw parties in the tunnels or drink wine.
For catacomb devotees, the silence experienced deep in tunnels cannot be replicated anywhere else.

&gt;The network has become a draw for Parisians who want to explore the unchartered territory, who are known as Cataphiles.

That's interesting, do you have a source for that? Cyrillic has been used for centuries in hand-written documents in parts of Eastern Europe and all Russia.

Maybe you're confusing current sociological pressures with the way things will be for the rest of eternity?  it's very obvious that poverty-communities are what inspires these crime statistics, exactly the same as when the other racists cite silly stats about black people in the american criminal system - they forget to mention that rich black people have similar crime stats to rich white people, likewise rich and educated muslims again have similar stats.

The Court cannot reasonably argue that the California people cannot ban gay marriage, but its legislature can.

That information gets accessed at the same time as the grammatical class, so there's no issue of ambiguity whatsoever. Language change is natural and pervasive, but it also won't occur if it leads to issues of greater ambiguity or less efficiency. 

EDIT: a good case in point is the (near) complete loss of the English case marking system. Old English had just as many overtly marked cases as modern German. It lost them because of a shift from reliance on overt marking to a rigid word order, which conveys the exact same amount of information. We can't say *why* the change took place, but there was demonstrably no change in the efficiency of information transfer.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I honestly believe you're just an Islamic apologist. And the fact that you're so willing to criticise Christianity as a diversionary tactic when the subject is Islam is HIGHLY suspect.

Criticising Christianity is in no way a diversion, because the OP made the argument that Islam was different at its core, and that this difference was to blame for Muslim violence.  Pointing out that Christianity contains much the same messages of hatred and intolerance in its core text is *directly relevant to the argument being made by the OP*.  In the same way, it is entirely appropriate to question the crime rates, because if there is an innately violent core to Islam, and if this is to blame for Muslim violence, then you would expect Muslims to commit a lot more violent crime as a proportion of their population.

Now, I'll say this clearly (and not for the first time, though possibly not in this sub-thread).  We do have a problem with radical, militant Islam.  There is also a wider problem with the attitude of Muslims towards criticism of their religion in a way that is not as common with other religions.  And radical clerics are too mainstream, and too accepted by Muslims in general, in a way that radical preachers of other religions are not.  There is a problem, and it needs addressing.  I do not deny that for a second.

But the idea that what's to blame is something at the very core of the entire religion; and that the core is somehow different to other major religions in Europe (particularly Christianity), is demonstrably untrue.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Criticising Christianity is in no way a diversion, because the OP made the argument that Islam was different at its core, and that this difference was to blame for Muslim violence. Pointing out that Christianity contains much the same messages of hatred and intolerance in its core text is directly relevant to the argument being made by the OP.

I stated 'British culture and attitudes have moved on. However it is glaringly obvious that Islam has not.'

That is a far cry from what you just implied I wrote.  Culture in the UK has moved in a direction towards tolerance and acceptance, whilst Islam's (and yes Christianity in many ways) core principle is *non-acceptance*.

Time and again I come back to the point that the subject is Islam.  Try to set aside your obvious dislike of Christianity.  It is irrelevant. The subject of the discussion and criticism is Islam.

&gt;In the same way, it is entirely appropriate to question the crime rates, because if there is an innately violent core to Islam, and if this is to blame for Muslim violence, then you would expect Muslims to commit a lot more violent crime as a proportion of their population.

But this ignores the point I was making and instead twists it into a sub-point that you want to make.  If we take, for example, that ordinary citizens of Islam are no more likely to engage in crime, it still wilfully ignores the fact that *at a state level* violence is extremely common.  As I stated, Islam spreads a message of division, and it is that division that creates hostility and violence towards those who do not follow it.  But my point was that *British attitudes have moved on*.  However, Islamic attitudes don't seem to, change in the same way Christianity or any other religion has.

&gt;We do have a problem with radical, militant Islam. There is also a wider problem with the attitude of Muslims towards criticism of their religion in a way that is not as common with other religions. And radical clerics are too mainstream, and too accepted by Muslims in general, in a way that radical preachers of other religions are not. There is a problem, and it needs addressing. I do not deny that for a second...But the idea that what's to blame is something at the very core of the entire religion; and that the core is somehow different to other major religions in Europe (particularly Christianity), is demonstrably untrue.

Then you need to start banging the drum about it is hard as you do about Christianity.  I have a live and let live attitude, however Islam is suffering from a **major** PR disaster right now, and simply stating that 'oh well, you know, Christianity is just as bad' just gets peoples backs up.  Because we live in the real world, and we see the harm that *many* Muslims cause in the name of their so called religion.  And we don't see anything like the same problems emanating from Buddhism, Christianity, Hindu's or any other religion.  There are problems, but nothing approaching the scale that Islam has.  And the apathy amongst the so called 'moderate' Muslims is hard to stomach for many.

You're uninformed and misled. Or simply willfully ignorant. France did ask the United States for assistance, both [formally](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/) and [informally](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/26/france-us-mali-intervention-obama_n_2556935.html).

&gt;Why would the intervention in Libya need US logisitical support when it is only a few hundred miles from over a dozen European air force bases?

I don't know, how about [you ask you're government](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-future-nato)? It's a very good question, and it's even more disappointing looking in hindsight, that even with all those airbases, Europe couldn't handle the operation by themselves and required American logistical &amp; military support. 

Where were you when Libya happened? Did you even turn on the news?  

&gt;Comes from having entire countries decimated in a war. If America had suffered the devastation Europe did in WW1/WW2 your country wouldn't be as warmongering as it is.

Drop the act. You're not more mature or englightened than me because of your birthplace. You did not magically absorb the wisdom and world-weary ways of your ancestors. You're not special because you live on another continent. 

This is the real world. It's dominated by realpolitiks. Grow up and get your head out your ass. 

&gt;Personally as a European and more importantly as a Brit, I wish America would just fuck off.

Trust me, I would love to fuck off and leave you to rot. After the Mashall Plan, Fulda Gap, Kosovo, Libya, only to be told we're useless, stupid, fat, ignorant war mongers.

&gt;If anything you're making us targets just the same as you did in the Cold War.

The Cold War was the after effect of a **European War**. We didn't start that shit, we just helped end it. Europe spawned the Soviet Union, the Iron Wall, etc. We just backed Western Europe up because it was in our interests and we were more similar culturally. 

But fuck, you're right, we should've just let Stalin keep driving to Paris.

[This war is not as in the past; whoever occupies a territory also imposes on it his own social system. Everyone imposes his own system as far as his army can reach. It cannot be otherwise. If now there is not a communist government in Paris, this is only because Russia has no an army which can reach Paris in 1945.](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin#Unsourced) - **Said in April, 1945, as quoted in Conversations with Stalin (1963) by Milovan Djilas**

You say that the US (like Britain) has a ""horrifically two-party system"", yet you fail to mention why multi-party governments might be preferable. Historically, many political scientists have seen two-party systems as useful because they promote centrism and avoid fractious and deadlocked governance. 

You also negate to mention the problems that France and Germany have had with multi-governance in the past. The French Fourth Republic, for example, suffered from a lack of political consensus and a weak executive, with governments forming and falling in quick succession since WWII with no party or coalition able to sustain a parliamentary majority. 

Secondly you say the U.S. has a ""media dominated election"", but you provide no proof that either France of Germany are subject to less domination, or that it is necessarily a bad thing that negatively effects governance. 

Thirdly, you say that the U.S. has ""worse problems"" but you fail to mention any apart from Health Care, or why Health Care should be regarded as the litmus test for ""good"" or ""bad"" governance in the first place.

- Seit einigen Jahren müssen eingezahlte Banknoten nicht mehr erst zur Prüfung (Echtheit, Zustand, etc.) zur Notenbank, bevor sie wieder in den Kreislauf gehen, sondern dies können die Banken direkt erledigen.

- Geldautomaten mit zusätzlicher Einzahlungsfunktion heissen [""Cash-Recycler""](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_Recycling). Diese dürfen von Kunden eingezahltes Geld umgehend wieder an die nächsten Kunden auszahlen, ohne weitere Prüfung durch die Bank.

true,uututhrwa,null,null,"It's kind of hard to gauge, it's a bit of a hyperbole but there is in fact a problem with 15 year old little shits embracing the golden dawn circus.

First off teenagers in greece have long been overly political for their age and understanding of society/economy. As the article says a few years ago you'd have 13 year old ""anarchists"".

I mean, if you are a teenager and shout off your math about some extreme / utopistic / anti-establishment / manichaistic / usually one way or another involving violence, political ideology, everyone will think you are a noble ideological soldier being a badass or something.

It also had close ties with how football hooliganism worked in Greece. And to how the whole society/system in the end usually promoted the people that shout off their mouth (while lying, stealing etc.) vs ""sane"" people.

Before I comment directly another thing to keep in mind is that the Golden Dawn really isn't about racism. It's about being arbitrary, getting money by force, people that were stealing benefits and refuse to take the blame, and shit like that. There are very few areas in Greece (a few neighbourhoods in Athens) were the problem with the immigrants is serious enough. In fact the reason why most Golden Dawn voters seemingly do not even understand the connection between the Golden Dawn and neo Nazism etc. (despite the fact that the Golden Dawn leaders are indeed neo-nazi colon flora) is that the reason they vote Golden Dawn doesn't even have to do with the immigrants, they vote ""arbitrariness partisanship and use of force in the way the country is governed"". It's like they are not racists, they don't even really feel the immigrants being a problem, they are sociopaths, the idea is ""I will do what the fuck I want and I will fuck Merkel and if it is racist I don't give a fuck""

My cousin and his friends all voted Golden Dawn (them being 18 year olds with low SAT scores, or whatever their called abroad, and into partying / gymming / cars etc.) If you were to ask those pussies what they think of the economical crisis it would be something along the lines off ""FUCK MERKEL I WILL RAPE THE BITCH THEY TRY TO SELL OFF GREECE BUT WE WILL FUCK THEM ONLY GOLDEN DAWN EVERYTHING ELSE IS FOR PUSSIES WE DON'T HAVE DEBT THEY TRY TO STEAL PETRELEUM BUT WE WILL FUCK THEIR TOURISTS IN SUMMER"".

So keeping in mind that football teams currently barely manage to economically survive, and that the party (Syriza) that was more or less organizing the underground leftist movements has turned into what was the ""old PASOK"" and to an extent abandoned them, and also started to do the unthinkable mistake in greek politics which is to mention trade offs (BOO SELL OFF TRAITORS WE WILL FUCK YOUR MOTHERS) all the political delinquents are starting to flock to the Golden Dawn.",0,1359848731,null,0,false,0,c88aovx,t3_17rhg9,t1_c88aovx,t1_c885ues,null,1435634512,20,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,20

Shops in those places can be open around the clock. The Munich main train station has a mini supermarket in it where you can pretty much buy everything at pretty much any time. It’s more expensive than a normal supermarket and quite small, but otherwise indistinguishable.

Except … someone in the Bavarian government apparently noticed all those small shops, selling stuff around the clock and even on (gasp!) Sundays! Those shops are allowed to be open to accommodate travelers and no one else, something the Bavarian government is now enforcing.

How? Well, outside of the legal opening hours, those shops can only sell things travelers can conceivably do something useful with. What does that exclude? Frozen pizza, for example! There is a sign on the freezer in the shop in Munich’s train station explaining that. No frozen pizza on Sunday or after 8pm.

Gas stations can even more directly check whether someone is actually traveling or just walking around. This, combined with the perceived problem of teenagers frequently buying cheap beer in gas stations on weekends before going to a bar or club, had a truly bizarre regulatory outcome: You can no longer buy beer in a gas station if you are not traveling (i.e. arrived there in a car). Let me spell that out for you: You drive? You get beer. You walk? You don’t get beer. (As far as I know it’s exactly the other way around in the US. Is that right?)

I used it to say ""not the standard variety of german"". The expression is found in many, but not all the dialects.

I'm a bit confused about the last part, but if I understand you correctly, then I agree, the expression is common in large areas, but some don't use it at all and I (and friends who moved around a lot) have encountered quite a few people who were confused by it. Also, people from various areas that moved to my vicinity don't know it. Many know it passively, but there _are_ regions that react to it in the same way OP did.

When Greeks from other sides of the political spectrum point out the similarity in the ""authoritarian"" part, the communist leaning get irate, and so they avoid discussing authoritarianism.

Say Stalin's regime was ""state capitalism"". Anything that doesn't satisfy economic equality is ""capitalism"". Does this sound like what they mean by the term, as a theory in the political/economical sciences?

The Golden Dawn does not ""blindly support big capital"", wtf, they have in fact explicitly declared themselves ""anti capitalist"", but just as with the communists they have their own version of capitalism, which makes even less sense. It's something like ""if it isn't Greek it has to be nationalized"". 

They don't really have any meaningful economical plans, 90% of their parliament members don't even have a university degree. 

More or less they want some big nationalist public sector (many cops, large military, state/military control of resources) giving wages and benefits to the far right, and a closed and controlled semi capitalist economy with enough room for them to get arbitrary install their people etc. Say they'd close down all the LIDL stores and force everyone to buy from shops of people owning some ""certificate of being far right enough"".

I'd also like to add that it's not uncommon to find scientists leaning to the political left as soon as the human behaviour is the centre of their research, such as psychologists, sociologists or political scientists.

Last, not least, what you call leftist, or even nutty, today, might turn out to be socially accepted and part of the agenda of a centre-right party in a few years.

Examples? 

30 years ago you were a perverted, nutty leftist to demand even the most basic gay rights, 40 years ago you were a nutty leftist to step in for stricter protection of natural resources such as clean air or the water we depend on, getting a divorce wasn't an easy thing to do everywhere 50 years ago, 100 years ago you were nutty and leftist to demand the right to vote for women.

This list goes on and on and is in no way complete. A list of things nutty leftists have put on the agendas of conservative parties for you and your society. Things we take for granted today and lazily attribute to centre-right governments.

Hotels are really expensive in Paris. I don't know about appartments. The closest you are from the center the more expensive it gets. You can look for places to stay in the close suburbs where there is still metro stations (metro lines are from 1 to 14. If it's called by a letter it's a ""RER"", it's mostly a suburban train). 

Bus and metro are the best way to travel around the city. If you want a pass for the week you'll need an identity picture. It's around 20€ for unlimited fair in Paris. I don't know about the special passes for tourist but you can check it out at www.ratp.fr (the website has an english version). Major airports are reachable by suburban train.

If you like museum, there's tons of museum here... You'll find all the informations you need on the internet ;)

I'd recommend you to go up to the ""Sacré coeur"" where there is a beautiful view over the city and the neighborhood (montmartre) is really nice. 

Most tourists also want to go on the Eiffel tower. Just know that the line is usually very long. I think you can buy tickets on the internet to avoid the wait or you can be brave and take the stairs. You can access only the first and the second floor by stairs, not the third one.

Food is a major part in french culture but a lot of restaurants in Paris are ""tourists trap"". If you're interested I can give you some good places I know about. Oh and if you want free tap water in restaurant ask for a ""carafe"" otherwise you will pay for a bottle of mineral water.

Finally you should learn the basic french words : ""bonjour"" (hello), ""merci"" (thank you), ""au revoir"" (good bye) and ""parlez-vous anglais?"" (do you speak english?). Always ask if the person in front of you speaks english before speaking to them in english, they'll be nicest. And try to speak slowly ;)

true,silima,null,null,"ok, everybody seems to be giving different infos. Some are talking about bed sizes, others about duvets without specifying which is which. I am German and will give you some info on what to expect and what to buy.

First of all, beds don't have a box spring, but a slatted frame (Lattenrost) underneath the mattress. Which is better for your back, in my opinion, because the better ones you can adjust to be harder or softer. Also, you can usually raise the head or leg part, which might be something you wanna try. Beds come in the following widths:

* 90 cm (2'11'') - very small, only for one
* 100 cm (3'3'') - not so small any more, but still small, still only space for one
* 120 cm (3'11'') - this is ok for two occasionally. Nice size for one.
* 140 cm (4'7'') - this is even better for one person, also works for two, depending on sleeping habits
* 160 cm (5'3'') - from this size on, the beds are too big for one, IMHO. Works OK for two
* 180 cm (5'11'') - for this one, you can get separate mattresses and frames, so you don't feel the other person move in their sleep. If you search a bit, you might be even able to find a separate mattress and frame for the 160 cm size, but not sure about that.
* 200 cm (6'7'') - this is king size and a really big ass bed. Sleeps two. Separate mattresses only. 

Standard length is 200 cm, but for the 90 width I have seen 190 cm in length, too. Also, you can get most bed sizes in 220cm length. This is only necessary if you are really tall. And you will pay extra for the extra length. Might also have to go to specials stores and have a limited selection of bed frames.

As with the fitted sheets, you are right, they go on top of the mattress. 
But be careful, some fitted sheets will say 90/100 or 140/160 on them and fit on both sizes of mattresses. The thing is, they have to fit both, so they fit rather poorly on the smaller mattress size. Try to avoid those, be sure to buy the right size for your mattress so they fit nicely.

For the blankets, there are 3 sizes that are standard:

135x200 cm

155x220 cm

200x200 cm

The big department stores all carry duvets in that size and also the bedding to go with it. In my opinion, the 135x200 is way too small, even for one. You can't wrap it all around you, and your feet will stick out somewhere. It's even worse for two, just don't go there. I have always used the 155x220, and it's just perfect. It's enough for one person, but not for two. If you want bedding for two, buy two 155x220 duvets.

You can also get the 200x200, which is fine for two, more or less. However, if you really want a big ass blanket that will cover both of you without having to fight for the covers during the night: go to IKEA and only IKEA because they are the only ones to have this, and go and buy their 240x220cm duvet. Yes, it's big. It won't fit in a 90cm bed, it's just too much fabric. You need at least a bed that is 140cm wide for this. 

Only downside to the 240x220 cm duvet from IKEA is that you can buy bedding for it only at IKEA because it's the only store that has this size. Oh well, not to bad, if you ask me. For all other sizes mentioned in this comment, you can buy bedding at a store that has bed stuff. 

One quick comment on the pillows: the standard size in Germany for them is 80x80 cm (2'7''x2'7''). I have also seen 40x80 cm, which are harder to find, but again, IKEA is your friend here.

He managed to pollute several left wing concepts and terms during his ""reign"", guilds and syndicalism, for example, but these were mostly used to contain and recruit from the revolutionary left, rather than being seriously pursued in a socialist manner.

Franco's fascism was on the periphery of what we might consider fascism, I'd call it fascism, but it was atypical fascism (atypical enough for Spain's fascist party to attempt assassination in any event).  Some have called it Catholic authoritarianism - and religion was certainly more central, but whatever you call it, there were atrocities aplenty, though not on the scale of the Nazis.

The Nazis again were brought to power with significant help from corporate interests, but theirs was a much more overtly racist form of fascism, with a syncretic borrowing of terms and ideas from left and right.  Any rigorous class analysis shows that it was revolutionary rhetoric without any intent or attempt at revolution.  Essentially, stripped of the rhetoric and word-play, it was an ultra-conservative welding of class structures in place on the back of a very authoritarian form of State capitalism.

But you're right, in a sense, in that, although it was absolutely capitalist in the sense that that term has to a Marxist/hard-leftist, with the exception of the ultra-nationalism, it was a very ""left wing"" (i.e. State heavy) incarnation of it.",0,1359902212,null,0,false,0,c88kf7u,t3_17rhg9,t1_c88kf7u,t1_c88k0we,null,1431169321,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

True. Can you show me any recent study that puts the Greek multiplier under 1? And if the study isn't true, and the multiplier is less than 1, why would Greece debt to GDP keep rising?   
  
It's true that it's not the fund's position though as, on the ground, they keep demanding for more and more austerity no matter what they say in interviews. Which just shows that the fund is either irrational or has some other agenda.

No, a multiplier bigger than 1 exactly means that it resulted in a net harm effect.

Now, in the German federal budget for 2013, €28.4bn are allocated for personnel expenses**, which is almost 10% of the entire budget, serving about 82m people which comes out to about €35 p.a. p.c., or more than twice as much.

And remember that that's just the Federal level, the states and muncipalities have their own staff on top of that.
My own home state of Nordrhein-Westfalen has spent €22.2bn on personnel expenses in 2012, serving some 16m people which comes out to a massive €1375 p.a. p.c., or 40% of the entire budget***.

[Please correct me on any mathematical errors I may have made, I'm not very good at the number crunching and all I had to work with was Windows' calculator and some very cold fingers. :P]

I haven't told you that the state employees include policemen and teachers who, in my opinion at least, deserve every cent they get.

But if there's already so much money being spent on administrative and executive functions, why should we stack yet another layer on top of that behemoth? And of course we should think about that, but in terms of saving money, it's not going to get us all that far. The appropiations that those people manage, those are what you want to cut if you really want to be austere. It's easy to point at public sector workers and say that they are wasteful, but all that firing them is going to get you is them appearing on another section of your budget, namely unemployment aid, while restricting the government's capacity to carry out the public will.

true,TheMania,null,null,"The problem is having to balance the budget. That there is the flaw in the Euro monetary system that needs to be corrected, not Greece's budget (/Ireland's/Spain's/Italy's/Portugal's/etc).

To see why, think about how the Euro comes into being - from a loan being issued. That creates money, paying back loans removes it. Accordingly, the net savings in Euros across the world has to equal zero, as if you have $1 in savings, it's been acquired through $1 of debt owed by someone else.

Now what happens if a crisis hits, and Greek households are trying to save instead of borrow? How can they do this when all money sums to zero? They need to force one of the other two sectors to run a deficit. Either run a trade surplus, draining the non-Greek nations of Euros, or have the government run a deficit. *These are the only two ways households, in aggregate, can save in Euros*. The money either needs to come from outside - or from the government.

Now what happens if the whole Euro zone is attempting to save due to a global financial crisis? The strongest nations will be able to, via trade surpluses. They'll export their way out. *This can not work for everyone*, as for one nation to be running a trade surplus, at least one other must be running a trade deficit. But nonetheless, this won't stop households saving - they'll try their hardest, it's the GFC after all and times are bad. So what happens? The government runs a deficit. As a simple matter of accounting, it's the only possible way for households to save in the countries with the weakest export sectors - and there will always be such countries.

The only way for a government to stop this would be to impose austerity to such a degree that it breaks the household's backs. Their will. Completely prevent them from reaching their goal of saving. Within the household sector, those with safe jobs will still be able to save - but this time by taking from those that lose their savings. You end up with unemployment. You end up with poverty.

All the market need know is that the central bank will not let Greece default. That they'll sooner print money.

As soon as the market knows that, the central bank needn't ever bail Greece out nor let it default, as Greece's bond yields would then be capped at expectations for the central bank set interest rates just as they are for the US/UK/Singapore/Japan/Canada/Australia/etc.

It's easy to see why: the only risk of lending to a government that you assume would sooner print than default is inflation. Inflation is a risk no matter who you lend to - or even if you keep your savings as cash. Everyone else has an *additional* chance of default, hence the government will necessarily be granted amongst the lowest interest lending in the currency. Now, the central bank sets the rate that banks lend to one another and in doing so, is setting a very real ceiling on what bond yields could possibly go for.

Complete and utter nonsense, if we talk about the government spending (disconnected from everything else - like in the multiplier), then the most the state spends, the best the private sector will be.

However (and for this we must look past the multiplier) state spending requires taxes, and these have a negative multiplier on the GDP, so it's not a case of simply looking at the multipliers, it's a case of looking at the benefits and the costs, including the opportunity costs. One can't say ""if the state spends 100 million euros, the economy will grow 150 million euros, so we must do this"" while ignoring the costs associated to the 100 millions euros in taxes (or 100 million euros * interest as is the case with Portugal and Greece that spent money they borrowed).

&gt;You know like the libertarians keep saying that the government gets all the credit and then there's not enough on the market for the private businesses. 

No, I don't know any such thing. A lack of market for the private sector? Who said that nonsense?

&gt;It's not totally stupid as in some situations the multiplier is indeed less than 1, particularly if your cuts also allow you to lower your taxes, or your main trading partners are growing, but Greece was in a completely different scenario. 

The multiplier evaluates things separately. Simply put, the Keynesian multiplier only measures the amount that dissipates from the economy either through savings, through taxes and through imports.

Though as I've said earlier, you can't look at things separately, you must take into account that the state spending their resources some way will mean they will not be able to spend it some other way and that everything they spend also has to be paid for.

With regards to Greece, the option of them continuing to spend is simply out of the picture, they find it impossible to levy more through taxes and people aren't willing to lend them money, not without very high interest rates, so it's not like they have much choice either way, regardless of the multipliers.",0,1359914715,null,0,false,0,c88nfkj,t3_17sy8x,t1_c88nfkj,t1_c88mp8g,null,1431170805,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

As for the torture, the pictures speak for themselves. It is tough to imagine how they could get beaten up like this during arrest, unless the police actually went into unarmed combat with them. There are ways to arrest people without hitting them in the eye, especially if they were outnumbered. 

&gt; The person uploading the photos probably thought that the public would have a better chance in recognizing them if their faces weren't covered in bruises.

This is indeed a stupid thought, for two reasons:

First, it is not self-consistent: A face does not become more recognisable if you obscure part of it. This makes no sense. 

Second, this is not consistent with the data we have. In the mugshot, you can also see part of his shirt and part of the white background having being doctored. Shirts and walls do not bruise, as a general rule.

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;There is an ""I don't know"" option on most of those questions, about a sixth to a fifth chose it for the EU powers question so I think you are totally incorrect to say people don't know what they want. The vast majority know what they want, and it's not more powers for the EU. Less than one third of even Germans and French want more powers for the EU and less than one in ten people, an astonishingly small number, want more power given to the EU in the other states. More people in France and Germany think powers should come back than they think should give up powers, and a majority think powers should come back in the others. Even more than this, of the tiny number that want more powers for the EU most of these would probably want a referendum. So the number of people who want more power for the EU without referendums is almost certainly single digit in France and Germany and probably getting near zero in every other country. 

You still did not really address why I think it is case that people do not know what they want. What they want is a nation that can run itself without interference from some other nation. Whether that means Germany, Denmark or Europe is completely irrelevant. People are going to be discontent when their affairs are essentially being blocked by some other nation they have no influence over just because they are members of a union. It limits the power of their democracy. The solution is simply to hand power to the EU if you want a union, break the union or reduce it to a free market agreement.

&gt;The only way for a government to stop this would be to impose austerity to such a degree that it breaks the household's backs.

Austarity breaks government's back.

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;Yes there should be a final decision on things. But the Europhiles have known from the beginning that they couldn't get the consent of people so they have been slicing their way along since the Coal and Steel Community all the way through to the euro. Quite a few of them knew the euro would lead to an institutional (if not economic) crisis which they hoped would lead to federation via more treaties. They want treaties because they are in the business of avoiding referendums or ignoring referendums where they are forced to hold them. So don't think the fact that the federalists have less than 1 in 10 supporting them will stop them, they will continue with The Project. 

Probably not. You also have to remember that nationalism is the reason they cannot get this thing going. There is no pan-European nationalism going on to bring a sense of cohesiveness and solidarity to the EU. And if there is then it is very fragile.

&gt;People like me are fine with a free trade deal and then some basic multilateral agreements (negotiated as sovereign states in the Council of Europe). These people, for some strange reason, hate the idea of that and fervently desire to have central control of basically everything - I am not aware of a single area over which they do not want total control - from Brussels. But they are too cowardly to put it to a resolution. So it's not just in their nature to be anti-democratic, they have been and are willfully plotting against the desires of the people since the beginning of the project. Those of us who understand this obviously wish to see them defeated. 

I think you are getting a bit fired up here and draw senseless conclusions. The EU is undemocratic not because of the people that create it, but because it is a union between nation states that each have their own agendas. It cannot be democratic as long as nation states have any say in the matters of executive and legislative power. That should lie solely with a government and an assembly elected proportionally by the European people. 

&gt;Genuine democrats like yourself want to see it decided clearly one way or the other. But I ask you, if you are the democrat you seem to be, and if these people continually avoid referendums and ignore them.. Don't you start to feel uneasy about their motives and commitment to democracy?

I do. That is why I feel it is important that Europe as a whole gets concious of what they want. That they take a stance and follow it instead of continuing this damaging dance in the middle. I am fine either way, but I would prefer the European Union to gain absolute power because it allows the European people greater political leverage against nations like China and the US. It allows us to be a positive influence on the world - a voice of reason - instead of those two madhouses.

&gt;And if these people will never give anyone a vote on it, then Europe as a democratic nation isn't really an option is it?

That is because nation states have too much power in the EU for it to function democratically. I agree that it would be wonderful if every nation did a national vote on every treaty, but the problem is that one nation can block it for *everyone else*. That is bad and not democratic.

&gt;And if it's not an option then you are really saying you'd rather have a minimalist EU free trade thing as a Dane rather than a non-democratic European nation that nobody actually gets to vote for. A democratic EU federation is not on offer, it never has been, these people are not democrats.

No they are politicians and bureaucrats. That is why it is important for the European people to step up to the challenge and get this thing sorted out before it crumbles.",0,1359923406,null,0,false,0,c88q3sz,t3_17t12e,t1_c88q3sz,t1_c88pwp6,null,1431172062,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

* I find Rennes to be quite a nice city, in every way I can think of. Nightlife, culture, food... There's actually around 50'000 students for a population of about 200'000 inhabitants, so it's really young.

* How to pronounce... As a native speaker, I would say 'Ren'.

* Brittany is an incredible place, you should use some of your weekends to visit. Near Rennes, the most famous place to visit is the Mont Saint-Michel, a stunning abbey. 

* The train is quite common in France and is run by the SNCF, a public company. Assuming you land in Paris, it may be the fastest way to get to Rennes, form the Montparnasse train station.

* In Rennes, the Star company provides monthly forfaits that allows you to use all the buses lines and the unique subway lines, which is fast and reliable.

* I don't know much about the nightlife, as I'm quite a SAP myself, but there's a lot of concerts and festivals inside or around the city. However, there's a few movie theaters, an opera, theaters, a fine art museum, several contemporary art galleries and museums, so there's a lot of openings and vernissages, if you're into this. (I study contemporary art and am an intern in an associative gallery.)

* I think you can easily find a SIM ; the four major providers are Orange, Bouygues Telecom, SFR and Free.

* Greeting a stranger is strongly advised, even in English. In French, *bonjour*, *merci* and *au revoir* are essentials.

* I think that, at least in Brittany, most people will understand and speak English better than Spanish. But there's still many exchange students, it shouldn't be difficult to find native speakers :)

* Brittany is famous mostly for its *crêpes*, *cider* and *kouign amann*. Many locals will be pleased if you ask them to try regional food.

You should google a bit Brittany, there's many tourism guides and stuff.

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;Ok, I can see majority rule on the federal issues after people have created the federation, that would be part and parcel of creating a federation. What I am talking about though is the creation. The actual choice to sign up to this thing needs to be a vote on a very clear readable document, a couple of times as long as the US constitution is one thing but hundreds of pages across multiple documents is totally unacceptable. But as I said earlier, that is not on offer, or at least they want to manoeuvre people into a currency, fiscal, political, almost everything union so that when the federal question comes people will be too afraid to leave. I think this is dishonest in the extreme. You present a clear constitution to the people and then respect the result, those that say yes can then be governed by the document (which will presumably have majority rule as you say).

&gt;But they did put a document called the European Constitution to some people, and the Dutch and French said no. But then, and the quotes verify this, they deliberately obfuscated the document into the Lisbon Treaty and passed it anyway without a vote in all but Ireland, who they made vote twice under various threats the second time. Then they broke the anti-bailout clauses in the treaty anyway, and now they are demanding more power with no mandate for it other than the crisis they themselves have incompetently, or insidiously, caused. I think trusting these people is very very silly at this point. 

What you are seeing is the problem of having a union of nation states in action. They all have their own agendas and they will all fight tooth and nail to get those through. That all have small points to pick with each other and that leads to obscenely long documents that no standard citizen could honestly bother to read through. 

We can make a constitution, sure, but I just want to point out that it needs to be a proper one and not glorified like the US constitution. A constitution is meant as a practical reminder of what your nation is founded upon and to set down some clear cut things the state, people and otherwise can and cannot do. At one point the constitution will get old and outdated, then it needs to be updated.

&gt;Regarding needing to be powerful to compete with a madhouse China and the USA, have you thought that maybe it's their very size which makes them mad? Have you thought that once you are big enough there is no citizen, no media that can oversee the hotbed of corporate interests that will descend on your capital and corrupt the process. From what I can see Brussels is worse than Washington already, it just has fewer powers at the moment. So I think you are being very optimistic in thinking the EU will be some light of reason in world affairs it will just be the tool of various corrupt corporations and lobby groups in the EU.

It's not their size. It is very obvious that it is not that. Their problem lies with their political and social structure rather than their size. The US is not even that big in terms of population. Corporations has it a lot easier to pull on smaller nations and utterly dominating them than a large one due to sheer power. Regardless we are going to be bullied by corporations by Corporate America if we do not defend ourselves, so what is your point exactly?

Many would consent. I fear that you're making a lot of sever judgements about people you ether know very little about or have never met (talking about non governmental europhiles here). For instance I'm indifferent to these ""thought police"" and just because it's being done by the side I support (Yeah I like the EU, look how bias I am).

Proliferation of false facts is viciously against my ethics. I don't believe they should be knowingly passed on under almost any circumstances. I believe they should have a light shone on them at every possible opportunity no matter where they come from. Unfortunately the EU is incapable of having some one point the torch for them and thus is the victim of false facts of to an astonishing degree. If the same was true of the UKIP or similar campaigns I would advocate it on their behalf.

To be honest I quite like the idea of fact checkers. I don't like that they're only going to be contradicting euroskeptic false facts and think it should be enlarged to all false facts and I mean indisputably wrong facts such as ""X said this"" when he clearly did not. That goes for all walks of life and by no means solely the EU.

As for your fascination with the idea that these ""thought police"" (they're not police. They don't persecute) and specifically them being incompatible with democracy: We're already the perpetrators of what you might consider undemocratic action and by that I mean the Short Fund which political parties in the UK can claim to help fund themselves. Surely that's more undemocratic then this? It puts a huge bias in the system towards existing parties meaning that the same parties always get represented, ect. Surely that is less compatible with democracy than ""thought police""?

So what's the importance of malian uranium in the decision? Quasi inexistant s my answer.

It seems unlikely, or even impossible. You just quote the government's announcement without applying any critical thinking.

&gt; But if you have to take an issue with that, what gives you the right to issue a verdict about obvious torture? Do you have evidence?

I did not say that the police are ""torturers and terrorists"", I just saw evidence of torture before me. I did not pass judgement on anyone, I just reported facts. There is a critical difference between saying that someone is a criminal and reporting that a crime is being committed. I did the second, not the first. 

If I was naive and didn't have any prior knowledge of how the Greek police works, I would be unable to decide which of the two possibilities (torture or injury during arrest) is the most likely. Even under that assumption, the doctoring of the photos is suspicious and I cannot just accept that it is ""just a meddling bureaucrat, nothing to see here, move along"". 

Moreover, if we are to quote people, why does the government's announcement hold any more weight than the lawyers and families of these guys? From a psychological perspective, people are afraid to report torture because it is humiliating and traumatising. Few people would go out of their way to report that they were put in such a position of weakness just to gain some pity and score political points against their government.

You can travel around in Germany pretty easy and comfortable using the Railway (Deutsche Bahn). I you book in advance, you get discounts. Like airlines do. 
The long distance connections are served by an ICE (Inter City Express) which is the most comfortable train. Berlin - Munich takes 6-7 hours. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterCityExpress

You can also rent a car and travel around the country. Your drivers license should be recognized as a tourist. You can drive Berlin - Munich in 6hrs. At least in theory, the traffic in Munich is sometimes insane. 

If you rent a car, read about the traffic rules in Germany. There is a Wikibook regarding travelling germany which I cannot find at the moment. 

You will need an adapter to use your electric devices in Germany, the power outlets differ. We have 230 Volt/50Hz, which should be supported by most modern switching power supplies of larger devices (Laptop etc.)

When Greece was on the Drachma all their debt was Drachma-denominated. So think about what you're saying - you're asking, how could Greece possibly afford to pay these Drachma-denominated debts without the assistance of other countries loaning the Drachma they issue back to them. A very odd scenario you are imagining indeed.

A country simply cannot go broke when debt is denominated in the free-floating currency they issue without during it purely voluntarily. It's literally never happened - not even Japan, over 240% of GDP in debt, is having the slightest difficulty with government interest rates. Why? Because their debt is yen-denominated, and the market assumes that bonds are as safe as the currency they are denominated in. Accordingly, interest rates *have* to be low, as it's the safest loan one can make in the currency.

&gt; Sure they could keep printing more money

Ah, the old ""money is fine if it's being created by the banks, but if the government creates a few dollars it'd be very inflationary"" argument. That's fine, if you prefer they could have gone on printing bonds just like any other currency-issuing nation.

&gt; Why are all the anti-austerity people allowing millions of people to suffer because they don't want to release their magical plan to fix everything?

There's only two ways to fix the Euro. Tighter fiscal integration, or giving up on the whole system and returning to individual free-floating currencies. The first would involve a government at the currency-issuing level, a government whose bonds are guaranteed to be as safe as the currency. If that government were in charge of unemployment benefits, it'd go a long way towards making the budgets of all individual nation's a lot more sustainable. The other way is obvious. You don't have debt crisises (at least as far as bond yields go) if your debt is denominated in the free-floating currency you issue, it's literally a non-issue.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; External sector is not ""withdrawing money"".

We agree that it is impossible for all countries to run trade surpluses at once within the Euro zone. Therefore, some countries will always be in a position where money is being withdrawn to other nations, and this will usually be those nations with the weakest export sectors.

Yes, they're getting goods/services in return. This doesn't change the fact that money is being removed.

&gt; It has to do with government not spending more than it collects with taxes.

If the government is taxing more than it is spending, the government is then also removing money. If it's running a balanced budget, then its impact is neutral.

Either way, the amount of money households are in aggregate saving is the trade surplus + the government deficit. If households are desiring to save, and there is no trade surplus (for it is impossible for all countries to run one), and the government is running a balanced budget - then they will find themselves unable. *Some* households will be able to save, but it'll be at the expense of others. Some will be put into poverty, spending will collapse, and unemployment will rise.

In aggregate, in your scenario, households will be losing savings - as you're supposing a trade deficit combined with neutral government budget. This is just a simple fact of national accounting, and is not really debatable. If you're one of the countries that *has* to be running a trade deficit (or neutral balance of trade), and your government is running a balanced budget, then your households are - in aggregate - not saving.

The way competences and money are distributed is a headache in every federal/decentraliced/whatever state. Concurrent powers (those where part of a matter corresponds to different levels of government, as in basic laws) exist in virtually every federal state, not just Spain (see [Germany](http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/GERMANY/CONCURRENTLEGISLATIVEPOWERS-DE.htm), [USA](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-concurrent-powers.htm), and the [EU](http://books.google.es/books?id=0FL1XnvccNkC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=concurrent+powers+eu+member+states&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jh8NVSTZ1Q&amp;sig=oxCSwxzhmY8_ixom5B8WVfpKIsU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UhMPUbHSMIXRhAfwjoEQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=concurrent%20powers%20eu%20member%20states&amp;f=false)). This happens with municipalties too, and also within different areas of the same level of government. Reality is just too complex to make a clean cut because every power has ramifications in every other. The whole idea of decentralization is an attempt to tackle this problem, looking for the level of government that is more efficient for each situation. This brings us to your point of education - the central and autonomous ministries exist both because they do different things, each on the competences allocated to them by the constitution and the statute. If the central government did not have any competences at all, then every autonomous consejería would need to hire a lot of new staff to cover for the part that is currently resolved centrally.

As for tax money, it is a concurrent competence, mostly leaning towards the central government. This is why most taxes are similarly regulated and normally only rates and rabates change from one region to another. *Income from taxes* is a different thing. For example, money earned by the two greatest taxes (VAT and Personal Income Tax) is divided between the central government and the community in which it was recapted 50%/50%. The central government only gets to distribute territorially the part that it is allocated by law, which is by far not ""all"". The system sucks for a lot of reasons, but not that one in particular.

The main feature of federal states is that there are territorial subdivisions that are directly subject to a right to self-organization. It is not about what powers they have or how deep they are, but the direct link between the constitution and them. All the territory of Spain has been organised in autonomous communities and the central government cannot constitutionally change their statutes (as opposed to the [UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Constitution_Act_1973)). The landmark [Constitutional Court decision 76/1983](http://www.uned.es/dpto-derecho-politico/sloap.htm) opted for  rendering article 150.3 inapplicable when it opposed the fundamental right of the regions and nationalities to their autonomy (article 2).
