true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; The EU could easily afford this welfare, which would at least, even without sovereignty allow the society not to collapse, and people not to, you know, starve to death, which seems inevitable if this keeps up.

No. You are again building a special case, but a system can't work on basis of that. Yes, EU could afford to pay welfare for Greece, but it can't afford to do that for Spain or Italy, not to mention if there would be multiple major countries needing assistance. Any system put in place must be workable under a situation where a major or multiple major countries drift to a position where Greece is now. 

&gt; Is this supposed to be united Europe? On one side of the continent 40-year olds deal with their mid-life crisis by buying expensive cars, and in the other, there are parents who can't feed their children properly.

You are essentially demanding solidarity, but solidarity is earned. You have to contribute to earn solidarity. Other EU countries have been contributing wast sums of money in forms structural and development funds to Greece. How much more needs to be contributed before the money flow turns back and Greece starts to contribute?

Another thing is that how people buying sports cars is connected to anybody? Bloody hell I'm in my early thirties and I could easily afford buying a sports car, but you know what, I also earn that money. In the case of corporation where I work, we are selling software and consultancy services to customers all over the world, for example selling software to Indians.

The problem in Europe is that there are too much people who complain and concentrate on envy success of others when they should be thinking on how can they themselves do things betters and work more.

&gt; For crying out loud, we have already established that the greek state has absolutely no actual power over its budget. Stop blaming the sheer incompetence of the troika on some domestic politicians who are easy targets.

No. What the Greek state failed to do in 2008, 2009 and 2010 was to start rapid transformation of the state. Greece wouldn't be in this situation if they would have fire that 120 thousand public employees in 2009. Not to mention liberalization legislation and privatization of loss making state monopolies and companies. That was where Greece dropped the ball.

&gt; Who is this everybody? Last I heard, the money tax evaders owed to the state was no more than 5 or 6 billion euros. As for corruption, there was simply not enough transparency from either of the two major ruling parties for the citizens to know that the debt existed to this scale.

Fakelaki... 

*Transparency International, an independent corruption monitoring NGO, found that 13% of Greeks paid fakelaki (bribery in the form of envelopes with cash donations) in 2009, which was estimated to account for €787 million in yearly corruption payments.[7] At the same time it was estimated that roughly €1 billion was paid by companies in bribes to public institutions for avoiding bureaucratic rules or to get other benefits.[8]

When calculating all sorts of corruption in Greece, the total amount is estimated to be roughly €3.5 billion per year (equal to 1.75% of the Greek GDP). Compared with corruption levels measured by Transparency International for 160 other countries, Greece ranked at 49th in 2004, was down at 57th in 2008, and slumped to 71st in 2009.[9] The government elected in October 2009 had on its agenda to increase the fight against fakelaki and other forms of corruption.[7]*

The thing is that there is culture of bribing and that hurts the economy badly.

&gt; With what money? How can the state pay for substantial stimulus when quite simply, it can not manage EU's money? This article shows by itself how they clearly have no control over their own budget.

Stimulus is out of question in Greece. The thing is that the state and society have failed themselves and the only way out of the crisis is to dismantle state and reorganize society until it starts to work again. This is what the Greek state very well can do, they can dismantle state services and reach, and they can re-target their budget funds. What they can't do is to increase spending, because frankly their system is unable to spend responsibly.

&gt; It is more than clear how much EU values domestic sovereignty, it's up to voters of idividual countries to support for an exit from the EU. That's not the issue. The issue is that, while the troica has complete control over the greek budget, this is the plan thus far:

You do understand that the money in question has to come from somewhere. In the same time when you are stressing Greek sovereignty shouldn't you ably the same to countries who need to contribute money to bail-out funds? You do understand that the money that other countries contribute is away from them, meaning less services and less infrastructure spending in here! 

&gt; It doesn't take a genius to deduce that when the consumers have no money to buy food, they can't spend money into buying stuff. Additionally, businesses can't grow overnight without stimulus.

No. The way out of recession/depression in Greece is not done with increasing domestic consumption, it is done by exporting more and achieving trade balance. How about exporting that olive oil to China? There are hundreds of millions of consumers who can afford it.

&gt; I myself have never heard of children going hungry in the east, or them having unemployment numbers that threaten to reach 30%.

That is the problem of Greeks. Greece is rich country compared to developing countries in eastern Europe. It is up to Greeks to organize their society so, if they want, that it takes care of everybody. However in real life there doesn't seem to be will do so, and again, that is internal matter of Greeks.

&gt; What? Compare the cost of life in Greece and Slovakia.

What I'm trying to say is that due to the disproportional attention an issue gets people see this issue as disproportionally large.

Is this from design? Yes, and no. Xenophobia sells news papers. People like very much to see their ideas confirmed. It gives a little hormone release in the brain that people like.
Apart from that is thatpractically speaking, since the press can't report on literally EVERYTHING, whatever it reports on will get a disproportional amount of attention.


Am I saying to censor what happens? Absolutely not! News organisations have a duty to report the news. However, these days I'm afraid one could end up being quite misinformed. There's a thread over in /r/worldnews about a article saying the Swedish riots have spread. The Swedish people in the thread are rather skeptical as to the severeity of this spread in reality, compared to the way the article describes it.

As for people going crazy. What happened yesterday before the Champions League final? Europe has this thing with football holiganism. These are people of the white superior race, from the superior white culture, behaving as if their village is under attack by another tribe.

true,debourg,FRAN,"Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité!","&gt;why are the Islamic people going crazy?

While all of the rioting and attacks from Muslims is new to Europe, it is not new to the rest of the world. Ask any minority from the Middle East or India and they'll tell you that this has been happening for 1500 years. Islam is a religion made to conquer (the ultimate goal is to wage jihad against all the infidels and take over the world). Their prophet was a bloody warlord. That's their inspiration. They're not getting crazy, they've always been crazy, it's just that as their populations grow they feel more confident to assert their dominance. This is the non-PC truth and I'll probably get downvoted to hell for it. A population of less than 3% Muslim like in Ireland and the US is small enough that they will not make trouble but once they get closer to 10% like in France and Sweden, they get more confident; they start forming ghettos, asserting their dominance and their law on it (""No-go zones"") which slowly degenerate into pocket of shit that look like the the Middle East. The streets of European cities are becoming more and more dangerous for young women as the coming of Muslims has soared rape rates as well as other crime rates (Did you see that video of that young woman walking down the street in 25% Muslim Brussels, it looked like she'd be safer walking down the streets of Cairo). And if you think this is bad, wait till the baby boomers die off and all of a sudden, the Muslim population becomes instead of 10%-&gt;25%+. You'll wish you could get a visa to Canada/US.

It is a common mistake to believe that the employer pays no additional fees. That is simply not the case.

It is in a way, and while the idea of belonging to a large group under threat (real or perceived) is foreign to me, I can hazard a guess as to why extremists believe what they believe. 

I believe that a lot of the people who kill in the name if Islam do it because of two things: either the perceived threat to Muslims around the world (in retaliation) or as a delusion of grandeur fueled 'Crusade' to convert the entire world to their way of life. 

The second group is much more insidious and dangerous. They truly believe it's their duty to devote their entire life to subverting governments, manipulating people and stopping short of violence (sometimes not stopping) in order to create a world caliphate. If they perceive that there's billions of people behind their cause, they will feel all the more need to 'fight the good fight'.

So he fetched his cut-off arm, went to his car, drove some 20km to the next hospital, where, at the emergency entrance, he told the doorman that he had an accident and his arm is wounded. The doorman now didn't see what really happened and told him to drive to the general entrance. There he got himself a parking ticket, went into the hospital, showed them his arm and told them to please sew it on again. In a 6-hour long operation they managed to reattach it.

Das geht zurück bis in die 50er Jahre unter Strauß, mit dem [Schützenpanzer HS 30](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HS_30) als erstes Beispiel. Hier wurden tatsächlich Schmiergelder gezahlt. 

In jüngster Zeit darf man sich z.B. über den [Hubschrauber NH 90 wundern](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/NH90#Kritik), der sich für Einsätze in Afghanistan und im Combat SAR Dienst als wenig brauchbar erwiesen hat.

Sure, now replace ""welfare"" with ""bail-out"". The EU has an arbitrary set of rules it cheats upon whenever it is profitable.

&gt; Yes, EU could afford to pay welfare for Greece, but it can't afford to do that for Spain or Italy, not to mention if there would be multiple major countries needing assistance.

Right, source?

&gt; Any system put in place must be workable under a situation where a major or multiple major countries drift to a position where Greece is now.

This is a short-term program to give underemployment for 200 euros bellow the minimum wage to 400,000 families with no source of income. Stop acting like this is a major aid pack. At the very worst, these families won't starve to death, at the very best, they'll start spending a bit, and improve the economic climate in general.

&gt;You are essentially demanding solidarity, but solidarity is earned. 

What a load of crap. Solidarity is defined as a ""union or fellowship arising from common responsibilities and interests, as between members of a group or between classes, peoples"". The European Union is a supposed supranational union with well defined responsibilities and interests. 

This is not a discussion between antagonistic corporations. Either stick to the most central idea of the Union (the fact that...um, it's a union? Unity?) or dissolve this circus.

&gt;No. What the Greek state failed to do in 2008, 2009 and 2010 was to start rapid transformation of the state. Greece wouldn't be in this situation if they would have fire that 120 thousand public employees in 2009. 

Meanwhile, the most conservative predictions suggest that 115.000 employees will have  left the public sector between the time period of 2011 and 2015 on their own, regardless of firing people or not.

Right, so state expenses are reduced, and unemployment rises even more...

But how is this the central issue? Oh, right. It isn't. Italy, Germany and France have an even bigger public sector. The problem is the industry. And instead of subsidising businesses, the troika is taxing them more, leading to an unpredecedented closure of businesses, and shrinkage in economic growth.

What idiot thought that recovery for both the state and the consumer would come exclusively by cutting down expenses and taxing? How does that produce industrial growth, increase GDP and give jobs?

Oh right...

&gt;The International Monetary Fund’s top economist [Olivier Blanchard] today acknowledged that the fund blew its forecasts for Greece and other European economies because it did not fully understand how government austerity efforts would undermine economic growth.

http://www.social-europe.eu/2013/01/imf-admits-austerity-mistake/


&gt;Not to mention liberalization legislation and privatization of loss making state monopolies and companies. That was where Greece dropped the ball.

What state monopolies? Name one public service that hasn't had a big percentage of its share sold to foreign corporations. Cheaply. 

&gt;Fakelaki...

Fakelaki is bribery, not tax evasion from the consumer... Mental gymnastics don't work very well when you are quoting the question you are trying to evade:

&gt;Last I heard, the money tax evaders owed to the state was no more than 5 or 6 billion euros. 

Oh, and...

&gt;The thing is that there is culture of bribing and that hurts the economy badly.

Sure... by increasing the cost of services? I guess? Like paying a doctor extra for an operation? Yeah that really killed the economy.

The corruption issue that harmed the economy was politicians who purposefully mishandled the economics for their own gain. But there was never enough transparency to find the ones who stole money. That was the issue, not the populist propaganda aiming the little guy who tried to cheat 50 Euros out of his taxes or the teenager who didn't pay for his bus ticket.

&gt;Stimulus is out of question in Greece.

Then economic recovery is not on the table. End of story.


&gt; The thing is that the state and society have failed themselves and the only way out of the crisis is to dismantle state and reorganize society until it starts to work again. This is what the Greek state very well can do, they can dismantle state services and reach, 
All state services have been sold out to some percentage, the public sector has tens of thousands of people and the state has cut its expenses to the point of having a tiny surplus (which only means that it doesn't have a deficit).

What now? There are 3 million people with no source of income, no welfare to guarantee their survival, and no means to grow the industry. Neither the government nor the society ""failed themselves"" in the way you mean it. They have been following the troica's orders, passing unpopular law after unpopular law, and this is where we are.

Grand.
Stimulus? Out of the question.
Welfare? It's against the rules!

So, it's just a ticking bomb, I guess.


&gt;and they can re-target their budget funds. **What they can't do is to increase spending,** 

""What loss of sovereignty? You totally have the freedom to readjust your budget as you wish! By decreasing spending!""

Were this not be tragic, it would be great comedy material.

&gt;because frankly **their system** is unable to spend responsibly.

We call it ""Not letting people die like rats"" around these parts.

&gt;You do understand that the money in question has to come from somewhere. In the same time when you are stressing Greek sovereignty shouldn't you ably the same to countries who need to contribute money to bail-out funds? You do understand that the money that other countries contribute is away from them, meaning less services and less infrastructure spending in here!

We are not discussing the bail-out here, that has already happenned. If they didn't want to bail Greece out, they shouldn't have. We are discussing the welfare plan. Which has the backing of the ECB and the IMF. But it's blocked by the EU not because of the amount of money, but its purpose, which is supposedly breaking the rules. If this was described as ""structural reforms"" it would pass without an issue. Comically enough, the bail-outs are also against the rules.

If those countries (which last time I checked, don't have children starving) don't want a Grexit, they need to earn it. The troica has essentially complete control over the budget. If their plans fail dramatically once more, they are in no place to blame ""the Greeks"".

&gt;No. The way out of recession/depression in Greece is not done with increasing domestic consumption,
Surely, for such a confident assertion, there must be a source.

&gt; it is done by exporting more and achieving trade balance. **How about exporting that olive oil to China?** There are hundreds of millions of consumers who can afford it.

Maybe you don't follow the news, but been there, done that. The real issue here is that not only does Greece produce much, but these are absolutely terrible conditions to set up industry.

It doesn't matter if we are talking about domestic consumption or extensions of the exports, in both cases, you need industry to do anything substantial. And for industry to stand on its feet during tough economic times, you need subsidies. And for subsidies, you need money.  And when you need money, you increase your spending.

&gt;That is the problem of Greeks. Greece is rich country compared to developing countries in eastern Europe.

And how many paragraphs ago did you reject the idea of increasing spending for welfare or anything in general? It's not a problem ""of Greeks"" because those in control of the budget are not Greeks.

&gt;It is up to Greeks to organize their society so, if they want, that it takes care of everybody. However in real life there doesn't seem to be will do so, and again, that is internal matter of Greeks.

For fuck's sake.

The Greeks have set up community programs for free, or sometimes at their own expense (with money they don't have!). Farmers are giving out some of their product, commodities are being exchanged, churches and municipalities are setting up small food banks (again, from money they are not being given from the state), people are volunteering, but no, fuck them, that's clearly not enough. They need to ""organize their society""! Probably round up all the fertile land and split it evenly, so that everyone has a source of food, or some crap. Or whatever to absolve responsibility from those who consider a sacrifice to minimally reduce spending in infrastructure in their own country. 

As I said earlier, this is not a union. This is merely the exhibitionist pretense of one. The sooner peoples who will in turn, end up in a position of need, realize this, the better.

&gt;Did you read what I wrote? Food, oil and gas cost the same everywhere, that is because they follow global prices. Oil isn't cheaper in for example Romania because work there is cheaper. Global market prices and global market prices.

[Evolution, brain size, and the national IQ of peoples around 3000 years B.C](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886909003675) (2010)

&gt; Multivariate Cholesky decompositions were performed with each brain volume measure entered first, followed by the four cognitive measures. Consistent with previous research, each brain and cognitive measure was found to be significantly heritable. The novel finding was the significant genetic but not environmental **covariance between brain volumes and cognitive measures.** Specifically, PIQ shared significant common genetic variance with all four measures of brain volume (r g = .58–.82). In contrast, VIQ shared significant genetic influence with neocortex volume only (r g = .58). Processing speed was significant with total brain volume (r g = .79), neocortex (r g = .64), and white matter (r g = .89), but not prefrontal cortex. The only brain measure to share genetic influence with reading was total brain volume (r g = .32), which also shared genetic influences with processing speed.

&gt; In differential psychology there has been a tradition of seeking fundamental parameters of cognitive processing or single biological variables that might account for intelligence differences. The results have been sparse, but two biological findings have persisted and accumulated: general intelligence differences are substantially heritable; and **general intelligence and brain size show modest, positive correlations.**

This coordinated public/private effort brings together an alliance of the country’s most innovative entrepreneurs, corporations, universities, foundations, and other leaders, working in concert with a wide range of federal agencies to dramatically increase the prevalence and success of America’s entrepreneurs.

Which translates to...

&gt; * Expand access to capital for high-growth startups throughout the country; 
* Expand entrepreneurship education and mentorship programs that empower more Americans not just to get a job, but to create jobs;
* Strengthen commercialization of the about $148 billion in annual federally-funded research and development, which can generate innovative startups and entirely new industries;
* Identify and remove unnecessary barriers to high-growth startups; and
* Expand collaborations between large companies and startups.

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"My flair would indicate that I am Belgian, yes.

To be honest I'm surprised that the Arab names aren't all numbers 1 through 5.  They have extremely small variation in their first names, usually just Mohammed and Yusef.  Ethnic Belgians on the other hand have a huge variation in name choices (many of them extremely retarded for example that sound like ""Semen"" etc).  So this is no surprise at all if all the Muslims are only picking from a handful of possible names.

I have no fear of parties like ""Islam"" because they represent a fringe demographic just like the neo-nazi groups in Europe which I believe pose a more significant risk to civil stability and are able to infiltrate politics much more subtly than these clowns (+ they exist in much larger numbers).  On top of that the government is already moving to [prevent them from being able to function as a political entity](http://www.brusselnieuws.be/artikel/voorstel-destexhe-wil-islam-partij-uit-gemeentelijke-functies-houden).  (Sorry, Dutch article).  I'll see if I can translate quickly:

&gt;**Proposition of Destexhe wants to keep Islam party out of regional functions.**

&gt;Destexhe submitted the proposition together with his party colleague and mayor of Koekelberg Philippe Pivin.  The proposition ensures that elected officials of a program which is contrary to European Treaty on Human Rights, the anti-racism law and the law against negationism , cannot chair the regional council and cannot sit in a number of local departments. (note: my translation of a lot of political terms is vague)

&gt;According to Destexhe there needs to be a ""cordon-sanitaire"" made around the Islam party.

I see Islamic influence receding, center-right/national parties are rising locally and stand generally contrary to any such influence.  First off is that we need ""official"" mosques because at the moment there are tiny unregistered mosques everywhere where radical clerics can spread hatred.

While jews were persecuted everywhere in Europe, in Al-Andalus there were even jewish scientist. Catholic scientists as well by the way.

You can not speak of a core in the Islam. That religion comes in just as many forms and shapes as Christianity. In the Koran you'll find passages that preach for ignoring people who insult the Islam, because punishing them is the job of Allah. You'll find passages about how Christians and Jews will go to heaven as well.

Also, your point reeks of conspiracy theories. It's ridiculous to believe that every person, who is also muslim, that comes to (Western-)Europe is here to ""colonize"" Europe. Has never crossed your mind that they might have come here to build a better life? To build a quiet peaceful life in a place their children can grow up peacefully?

* Unions of public workers are signing annexe to their contracts, because of savings to the budget. 

* Fiscal rule. A rule which will supposably ban any public borrowing was voted in our parliament and will come into law as of 2015. Politicans, public and experts are for and against this. There was plenty of debate

* In 4 months our budget spendings are already 1 billion euros bigger then our budget revenue. There will be some serious budget cuts to many departments. Our foreign minister said that if these cuts will stand he can just close his department, because it will be pointless to have it. 

* One of managers of one of our biggest construction company that went bust and lost millions, was charged for all sorts of things, got convicted was somehow relesed from jail, because of someone who forgot to renew (or something) her stay in jail card. So everyone got upset. Then everyone got more upset because she kinda didn't show up when they said she has to come back to jail. Then people were searching for her, premier and her cabinet of ministers were all looking for someone to blaim, prosecution office was looking for someone to blaim, there was public outcry, but in the end we found her. Or she turned hereself in.

* The former mayor of our second biggest city Maribor, Franc Kanler, was convicted for act of corruption, to 7 months in jail. There will probably some more appeals before offical conviction and jail.

* Amnesty International said some major issues are still around when it comes to dealings with Roma people and some other stuff. (My personal oppion here is as long as you don't live with them as your neighbours and you don't have to have everything bolted down, locked and under guard of dogs, you're afraid to go out at night because you can get attacked, robbed and run over by some drunk 12 year old behind wheels, then keep your mouth shut.)

* Parliament voted for a law about ""[The Erased](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Erased)"" It was about how much damages they will get.... There will probably be a big debate about this as well.

* Secondary school seniors (4th years) had a Quadrille. It was fun, what was not fun was watching them get drunk later that night and all the trash they left behind in the cities.

Il problema é che in questi campi viene usato quel che si chiama Open Method of Coordination.

Dal punto di vista tedesco, la loro virata verso i minijob non creava ""comparative advantage"" perché per quel che li riguardava, anche gli altri andavano nella stessa direzione. In realtá, la Francia é rimasta poco flessibile, e l'Italia ha mandato a puttane tutto il sistema di supporto.

&gt;
&gt;L’utilisation de semences dans les jardins privés n’est pas réglementée par la législation de l’UE. Les jardiniers amateurs peuvent acheter tout type de semence ou de matériel végétal et vendre leur matériel en petites quantités. Ils peuvent choisir d’acheter du matériel qui n’a pas été soumis à essai et enregistré et dont l’identité, la santé et la qualité seront uniquement garanties par le producteur dudit matériel (matériel de niche).
&gt;
&gt;Dans le cadre de ce système, les jardiniers amateurs peuvent également vendre tout type de matériel. Ils peuvent aussi choisir d’acheter du matériel produit et commercialisé par des opérateurs professionnels, c’est-à-dire des opérateurs exerçant à titre professionnel des activités de sélection, de production et de vente de semences, dans les jardineries par exemple. Dans ce cas, des règles plus strictes s’appliquent et des essais concernant l’identité, la santé et la qualité sont nécessaires.
&gt;
&gt;La réforme clarifie la situation: tout non-professionnel (jardinier amateur, par exemple) pourra procéder à des échanges de semences avec d’autres particuliers sans être concerné par les dispositions du règlement proposé. Le règlement proposé prévoit que l’utilisateur de semences reçoit les informations nécessaires sur l’identité du matériel (nom de la variété et caractères soumis à essai, par exemple) et que la santé et la qualité du matériel sont garanties.",0,1369585079,null,0,false,0,ca6c4e3,t3_1f2sla,t1_ca6c4e3,t3_1f2sla,null,1431027338,15,false,france,t5_2qhjz,15

The Arabs swallowed up the middle East and southern Europe until they were stopped by the French. Likewise the Ottomans never stopped attacking the frontiers of Western Europe. Their history was extremely bloody.

If we're about to compare how imperialistic different empires were, I believe the Islamic empires will be nothing compared to European countries/empires.

&gt;And overall, when comparing literature, science, art and architecture overall, the West was and is far far superior.

That's a very bold statement. How can you even see which ""civilization"" is superior in literature, art and architecture? Is the Big Ben superior to the Alhambra? And what is Western literature, art, architecture? Is Tolstoj western? Is the Aya Sofia western? Is Cervantes western? Is Les Demoiselles d'Avignon western?

Even for science that's a very bold statement. The fact that Europe became an industrial powerhouse in the 18th and 19th century isn't just a form of European exceptionalism. It's a world system evolution. Most of our progress came because we coincidentally discovered America and a result of horrible and cruel exploitation of that continent.

&gt;And about the Moors. The Moors were foreign invaders, they had to have a liberal society or else they would never achieve stability.

The inhabitants of the Iberian Penninsula before the Moors were invaders as well. Those were barbarians from the East who settled there after the Roman Empire fell. The ""re""conquista was a foreign invasion as well.

It's also funny that an islamic liberal society would be merely to keep stability. But a European liberal society is the result of Enlightment and Progress?

All the previous conflicts have ended the same way (with a ton less violence though), with the Tuareg separatists winning big over the Malian state in negotiations, usually without actually fighting because ATT didn't like to fight, which has only encouraged them and siphoned more of Mali's very small tax base into Kidal where no industry is ever developed because smuggling/being a mercenary/threatening the state is so lucrative. Mali spends more per capita on Kidal than the other areas and yet the separatists only know how to fight so they will start fighting again about being neglected (as if the rest of North Mali isn't) and make more favorable negotiations for themselves against a country that doesn't like to and can't fight.

""Tuareg autonomy"" isnt a real solution in its current form (no presence of the Malian state in Kidal) because Mali can't have a legitimate government while it exercises no authority in a large swath of the country because of a militia more powerful than the military. Kidal isn't just separatists, or even mostly separatists, so how can they have a vote without Kidal? Also it's unfortunate to reward the MNLA for tolerating and fighting with Islamic extremists.

It was no doubt a good thing he lost, but now France has re-entered a recession, bad job figures and a loss of credit rating, I suppose the opposing arguments of low immigration and social conservatism are beginning to win over some people.

In the UK at least, it's definitely the political climate. 72% of the country agrees with gay marriage. But that remaining 28% makes up 42% of the Conservative Party. In order to stay in power (i.e. get that 72% with out pissing off almost half of their party), our current Conservative-led Government will have to keep that minority on-board, and the only policy that the minority of 28% want that the majority don't find contemptible is, unfortunately, low immigration.

If you are a native speaker, it will be easy for you to be hired as a teacher at a language school or whatever. I know people who have been in the country for days and already have teaching jobs as well as after school private lessons. 

However, the issue is the visa. None of these schools will sponsor you to get a visa, or give you papers to help you. That's why the government program is the best, because they will get you in on a student visa. It is VERY difficult for Americans to get working visas in Spain, and a tourist visa is only valid for 90 days in the Schengen zone. While I've heard several accounts that border control is relaxed with Americans, I've been asked for my resident card (TIE) every time I've left and reentered Spain regardless of having an American passport, so I personally would not be willing to risk it because the consequences could be a hefty fine or a 5/10 year ban from Spain.

I'm currently doing the government program here, and I think it's worth the wait if you reapply next year. Take this year to save money and apply super early for next year. You could also look, in the mean time, into au pair positions. There are several people in my town who are au pairs and stay for 3-6 months. You could try that and apply for the ministry for next year. PM me if you have questions and I'll try and help the best I can. Good luck :)

I am reasonably proud that little Belgium still gives 4.2%, double of any other country in Europe apart from the aforementioned, Spain and Switzerland.

Newly joined Poland (just the end of last year) gives 0.9%, music to my ears!

So while the EU is giving the most at once (and yeah of course these are still tax dollars from member states just funneled through the EU) they seem to have a much higher priority for spaceflight and exploration.  Even so, the contribution of EU is only €867m, roughly 5% of NASA's current budget.

Also, would like to agree very much with the teaching comment. You will literally get no teaching experience as a CIEE/ministry employee as a language assistant. I am a certified language teacher in the US and came here to teach English and I feel like my skills were useless as the systems are really different.

Maj. Tim Peake will be the first to enter space while backed by the British government, ESA, and their money. Thus he becomes our first 'official' British astronaut if you will. 

Michael Foale flew under an American flag and on behalf of NASA, so we somewhat discount him (as unfair as that may be). Despite his retained UK citizenship, Britain had very little to do with him getting into space and he never really 'represented' us.

Mark Shuttleworth (space tourist) has dual South African and British citizenship but chose to fly with a South African flag on his uniform. 

Nicholas Patrick became a US citizen in 1994 to fly with NASA, and Piers Sellers did the same in 1992. 

As stupid as it sounds, Maj. Peake is being portrayed (as a result of the reasons above) as our first 'pure' astronaut. A lot of people have high hopes that this is the start of Britain being more proactive with our space involvement and no longer just relying on other countries and private opportunities. 

The UK government massively stepped up its share of ESA funding recently, and re-branded our national space organisation to the 'UK Space Agency'. It replaced a number of smaller, often useless, organisations which existed before.

Try to use the first class to see what he's most interested in improving, because he may have a good grasp on grammar but a horrible speaking or listening (which is usually the case with Spaniards), or viceversa, and try to adapt your lessons to what he tells you.

Another thing is be aware of his level at all times. I know this can seem weird and easy and something obvious, but you will get to a situation where you may plan an activity and not think that ""oh shit, he had to have learnt this first"" or ""shit, he has to use ""x-grammatical aspect"" that he doesn't know yet for this!"" when you're in the middle of the activity, so plan everything carefuly beforehand and you should be fine.

Also, try to speak English exclusively during the lesson, and only use Spanish if he has a lot of trouble with something specific. Feel free to use role playing even if at first seems silly,  but it's a really helpful technique and it may give him an example of what to say or how to behave in different situations in the future if he finds himself in a situation where he can't use Spanish.

And eff yeah at using media in your lessons! Songs are reaaaaally helpful (but again, mind the level, I've had some ""oops"" moments because of this, lol), as are movies and tv. Maybe you can see a tv show or a movie that he's into it or that he has seen before and try to talk about it, let him try to find if there are differences in expressions because of the dubbing and those kinds of things. Also tell him to watch them with English subtitles as it is also helpful to improve his reading/listening skills.

But then it became clear that behind the scam had slipped one of those perverse projects through which the fanatics of deconstruction and globalisation want to destroy the last remaining frames which structure European societies. One has to remember that marriage is not a question of love. It is not a simple contract, it is an institution designed for the children to come. It guarantees a child an identity represented by a true father and a true mother. That is what the Taubira law wanted to destroy, by replacing the rights of children with the right given to gay adults to treat themselves to children based on the criteria of consumer society.""

Yes, marriage is for the children. That's why people who don't want children also get married. They get married because of the benefits they get being married that they would not, if they were not.  They get married because they love each other, and it means something in our society to get married. Kind of, what with the massive divorce rate. Children growing up with both their parents in the same house are a rarity and I certainly don't see that trend changing.

Really? I'd say a secular conservative wouldn't necessarily look upon the places that have gone through with it with much favor.

&gt;Yes, marriage is for the children. That's why people who don't want children also get married. 

You think Conservatives are fond of that as well? If anything they want to prevent it going further that way.

Even the oldest marriage laws, Assyrian and Babylonian in origin, only leaves one out of monogamy and that's if the woman is barren.

MLK was a clergyman and even his daughter thinks he would have opposed gay marriage today. Gandhi held even worse views of black people and was very conservative when it came to dealing with his fellow indians, he didn't exactly stand up for the casteless for example.

In the ways their state behaves quite obviously yes. The people tend to be very traditional when it comes to family though.

I didn't say that, the man who martyred himself did so. Personally i'd be surprised if even half of the protesters are there because of their religious beliefs rather than their traditional views of marriage and perhaps more pertinently family.

Conservatives think that Marriage is about children. A childless marriage is in the minds of many conservatives barely a real one at all.

As in a blatant untruth.

&gt;The government is essentially stripping away the very meaning of marriage as far as those protesters are concerned. You might be surprised to find they think that's oppressive in and of itself.

But in their mind there are already millions of marriages that are meaningless because they don't have children, so what do the gays have to do with it? Just don't consider their wedding as ""a real one"" and move on with your life. The ""very meaning of marriage"" in their repressed world view was stripped away long ago, at the latest when divorce became possible.

1.2 million children in France alone, and that was in 2006.[Source](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1259) That's a lot of kids where either mum or dad lives somewhere else.

I do, when I see two men walking down the street holding hands, maybe even sharing a kiss, and they don't get arrested or worse. I understand that a conservative likely wouldn't share that view, but it really doesn't matter. Gay marriage is just another step in the right direction.

The gays have little to do with it, the response would have been the same for just about anyone else. It's an official liberalization of marriage that's being enforced by people who don't respect their view of it to begin with. It's no real secret that certain wings among the Left want ""traditional gender roles"" i.e. anything resembling a family to be done away with as well. Hence why it doesn't really help your case when people start talking about how many parents are unfit for their children and that the state could take care of it, as if we didn't already have institutions to deal with exactly such sad excuses for parents.

Most people in Husby are not muslims, actually, which you would know if you read something else. 

Second - the harassing comments *only* comes from his family, *not* from the other sources, like neighbours, police, etc, so again, your source is questionable. 

&gt;You keep saying I'm blindly defending Portuguese, because I'm Portuguese. No! He was old, mentally unfit and quite possibly seriously pushed. 

He was not particularely old, by any standard, and he was not pushed, in fact, he hadn't taken his medication - that is what pushed him over the edge, not anything else. 

&gt;As I said in previous comments, I suspect that shitty community brought this situation on him! They're partially guilty for his murder, and for breeding bands of thugs and tacitly or indirectly approving of their harassment tactics.

It is apparent, that you know nothing about the community, as you apparently know nothing about life expectancy in Portugal, Swedish police, or the Swedish police training 

&gt;Harassing someone, who has mental problems or is just old and not of their ""tribe"" to provoke a reaction, to then you call the cops on him who are played and turn on him. Then play the victim card... There are just too many levels of fuck-up in this whole situation.

*Or* we have a mentally sick man that *according to the neighbours, most of them *not* ""youths"", that was rather quiet and left alone, until he started to threaten them with a knife after going off his meds. He started it - not them. The poor neighbours were then scared, and called the police. The police tried to negotioate, and spoke to him so he knew it was the police. However, being off his meds, he didn't care. The police then, fearing for his wife's safety threw in a shock grenade, that didn't work. He then came charging at them, with a huge knife. The police, doing what they were *trained* to do (which you claimed the were not, but you have no sources for your claim, and I don't even think you have ever even spoken to a Swedish police) shot him, in the ""body"", the biggest piece. He died there, in his apartment. Tragic, but not the conpiracy you claim. 

However, I understand that no such things as *facts* interests you - as soon as I present them, and prove you wrong (as with Swedish police training, life expectancy etc) you just changed the subject, so I guess you will just go  back to your made up story. However, it is not true, not at all. All the facts are against you - not that you seem to care about facts. 

&gt;Is that a bad trait to show some kind of sensitivity towards those facts? I'd rather keep my unattractive trait than to be a complete ice block.

It is a bad trait ignoring facts to the point of fantiscm. You are not being sensitive, you are being a fanatic who are ignoring or even worse, making up facts.

I can try however to give you a political reason for the current turmoil. In September, when the government started to work on this law, the main opposition party (UMP, right wing) was having its internal election. Due to several historic reasons, this election is won by appealing to the people closer to the far-right, so both main candidates tried to look as conservative as possible.

When someone, who is liked by 30 to 40% of French, tells you that a law threatens the foundation of society and calls implicitly for a coup d'état (I'm kidding you not, Copé talked about the 1958 spirit, when De Gaulle took the power amid military agitation) you do bring crowd to the streets.

I don't challenge the fact that there are generally more conservatives in France than foreigner (and I) suspects. After all, Sarkozy got almost reelected.

that way we don't need to tell everyone over and over again that:

- drinking isn't socially akward in Germany. You can drink Beer and Wine from the age of 16. Harder stuff like Vodka, Rum or Schnaps from the age of 18. And yeah, people drink publicly, and we have 'Fest' (parties) just for the reason of drinking.

- yes, on some parts of the Autobahn there are no speedlimits. There are some very funny videos of american exchangestudents driving on it... and screaming a lot. Tho Germans are used to it, and it takes far more to get a driver license in Germany than in the States.

- waiters don't come to your table in Europe in general to check how you are faring every 5 minutes. You just wave at them if you need something, or they come by on their own if they see that you are done eating etc.

- Europe, and especially Germany, are very open about sex, compared to the US. However we censor violence in movies far more than you guys do.

- you don't need to speak German, almost everybody does speak english on some level. So if you don't care too much about the grammar, spelling or ze th, you should be fine.
If you try to learn German, your best bet is to pretend you don't speak english at all tho. Since most Germans, not out of rudness, will speak in english to you, if you try to speak in broken German. (The French and Spanish are the other way around. They only like you if you try to speak a little of their language).


well, those are the questions I remember being asked the most anyway.

oh, two more popped up...

- public restroomes usually cost to enter

- it is uncommon to order tab water in restaurants and there usually is gas in water (carbonized water everywhere). The tab water thing is easily explained by the fact, that restaurant stuff is paid more in Germany than in the States. Restaurants cover their expenses with the prices on food, but make their profit on drinks.

another thing:

- yes, food might seem more expansive in Europe compared to the states. You won't get a happy meal for 2 € or your 1.29 Dollars. However real food aka. fruite, vegtables etc. are far cheaper. No need to pay freaking 2-3 dollars / € for a simple bell pepper. And apples really taste like apples, aren't manipulated to taste like chocolate or vanilla or such.

- oh, you are also in for treat when it comes to european sweets, as they aren't made with cornsirup, but rather with cane sugar.

ok, one last thing :-) I guess I could keep going, since my mind seems to be trashed with all those things I read on reddit...

 - you will probably feel perfectly at home when it comes to music and movies, since in Europe we listen to a lot of american artists and our cinemas are filled with movies from Hollywood.

The fact is, which I have been arguing about with other Swedes here as well,it is far better off than a lot off other places in Sweden, that do not riot.  So, yes, the unemployment is high for Stockholm which has something like 4%, but not that much for the inner part of Norrland(the north) where there can be 40% in areas.  Same with education.  And, actually, I think the people in Husby, claiming the generous Swedish welfare system are far better off than many working Europeans.  That is also that a) the riots really are no riots in that sense and actually no one apart from a few police officers has been hurt.  B) there a a few burnt cars, not good, but certainly no riots c) the ones ""rioting"" has been known to the police before, and have quite extensive arrest sheets.  So, I claim those rioting are already criminals who makes up any excuse, the are not innocent little frustrated kids. And, above all, they are outnumbered, to vast degrees, by the majority in Husby, immigrants perhaps, but ""normal people'"", not criminals.  


As for the shooting of the man- of course it was tragic. The first question however should not be the police, but why did he go off his meds and thus, threatened people with a knife.  (It is rather normal, by those ""Muslim criminals"" in Husby, to lock the door and call the police, don't you think?).  I know in some states in the US they force them to come in and take the meds - forever, but I am not sure we have that legal framework.  Also, it is a huge loss of personal rights, particularly if you haven't done anything before.  99,9% of the mentally ill only harm themselves. We might walk the way of the US but I am not sure I want too- locking someone up indefinitely for something he might do is something I am extremely uneasy about.  

I get you do not like the Swedish police, but at least blame the proper culprits, they work within a framework given to them by the politicians.

Certes, mais pourquoi mettre un frein au désir des gens ? Pourquoi empêcher dans la législature un désir tout à fait naturel ? Dans un couple hétéro, si l'homme est stérile, on utilise la technique in vitro. C'est aussi **""**contre nature**""** (j'insiste sur les guillemets), mais c'est moins vaseux sous prétexte qu'il y a un homme et une femme ? Pourtant, cet enfant sera baigné dans autant d'amour que celui qui a été fécondé dans une éprouvette, mais qui a été mis dans une famille hétéro...

Un couple proche de ma famille à adopté une petite vietnamienne il y a 5-6 ans, lui avait déjà un fils d'un mariage précédent (déjà majeur), et il n'a pas pu avoir de deuxième enfant avec sa seconde femme. Ils ont essayé pendant des années, et ils ont adopté, alors qu'ils avaient tous les deux 45 ans bien tapés. La petite a été tellement désirée, que quand elle est arrivée le bonheur était réellement visible dans leur maison. C'était très attendrissant, et j'aurais trouvé ça incroyablement injuste qu'ils ne puissent pas concrétiser leur vœu le plus cher. C'est la même chose avec les homos. Le désir d'avoir des enfants est naturel, pourquoi le refuser ?

C'est effectivement un argument pas très construit, mais ce sont des questions qu'on ne pose pas nécessairement avant de dormir et surtout pas quand on est pas trop concerné. Il faut y réfléchir un peu et se forger son opinion soi-même ce qui est parfois difficile dans des sujets qui sont plus ou moins tabous.

true,Fdurke,Languedoc,Languedoc-Roussillon,"La GPA ma réticence vient purement et simplement du caractère ""location de ventre"" que je ne peux même pas concevoir comme une ""bonne chose"", le caractère opportuniste et exploitant de ces actes actuellement dans les pays du tiers monde ou aux USA et le caractère jusqu'au-boutiste des, pardonnez moi le mot, ""criminels"" qui vont l'utiliser au mépris de l'enfant à naître (*qui risque de pas être reconnu par l'Etat etc...équivaut pour moi à mettre son gamin devant un car de CRS*), ne me font rien espérer de bon. Sans parler qu'on voit déjà les problèmes que pose les ""don spermes"" avec des donneurs qui veulent reconnaitre leurs ""progénitures"" et inversement, quid d'une femme qui aura porté l'enfant et in fine ne pourra supporter la séparation, le sacrifice qu'est la gestation n'est pas éradiquée par un vulgaire contrait. D'autant que la configuration même de la chose fait que ça ne peut être un ""emploi"" normal, ça demande une réduction de la liberté individuelle de la ""bailleuse"" proprement détestable et une chosification de la conception que je ne peux supporter. Qui encore des cas de fausses couches, de mort de la parturiente, ces choses rares chez nous arrivent néammoins et alors déjà que c'est le bordel une fois sur 4 pour des contrats de pommes-de-terre ou de fournitures, je vous raconte pas les jugements en pareil cas. Ça reste hypothétique mais rien que pour cette possibilité ça devrait être interdit.

Pour la PMA mon raisonnement est le suivant, bien sûr la femme porte l'enfant mais ""naturellement"" elle a besoin de pour concevoir d'intervention extérieure. Aujourd'hui la PMA est un acte venant palier une maladie, un état non choisit non voulut et pathologique qui empêche un couple de pouvoir procréer alors que ""normalement"" il le pourrait. L'ouvrir aux couples lesbiens et aux femmes seules changent complètement la donne, on ne pallie alors pas une maladie, on vient changer cosmétiquement des limitations naturelles issues de préférences individuelles [comme l'a bien expliqué /u/moumini on introduit une autre façon de faire des enfants, une façon essentiellement technique]. exactement comme pour la GPA. Je ne vois pas dès lors que l'on reconnait le caractère ignominieux de la GPA pour des raisons naturelles et morales (l'homme ne peut pas porter d'enfant sans femme) en quoi ces raisons seraient moins valable pour la PMA. Ne voulant pas créer d'iniques inégalités je préfèrait interdire la procréation assistée pour les couples homos et les femmes seules que de faire cette situation intenable qui amènera inévitablement la GPA. D'autant que des outils d'adoption plus performant pourrait aisément combler le besoin des couples homos et femmes seules.

Ensuite je ne vois pas pourquoi une fois la PMA rabaissée à du cosmétique on interdirait à ce que des couples hétéros bien portant se fassent ""faire"" avec leur patrimoine génétique arrangé des enfants sur mesure, c'est la liberté individuelle après tout. Et encore une fois je ne vois pas ce qui se maintiendrais comme arguments ... si ce n'est le même interdit morale et naturel qui prohiberait la PMA.",0,1369642524,null,0,1369669423,0,ca6r9qt,t3_1f3zxl,t1_ca6r9qt,t1_ca6qro9,null,1431020056,7,false,france,t5_2qhjz,7

The police used stungrenades which did not stop the man, he still charged the police and got shot.

I can't speak for every country in the world but at least Sweden and USA has firearm training to put someone down = stop them, so they shoot for the biggest mass and multiple times if needed to stop the person from example charging you with a knife.

So to conclude, if a man that is 70 year old (it isn't that old). Who is mentally unstable and talked to the police through the door and definetly saw them through the peeking hole. Didn't get affected by a stungrenade and still charged the police with a machete then yeah the police has every right to shoot him down...

&gt;Certes, mais pourquoi mettre un frein au désir des gens ? Pourquoi empêcher dans la législature un désir tout à fait naturel ? Dans un couple hétéro, si l'homme est stérile, on utilise la technique in vitro. C'est aussi **""**contre nature**""** (j'insiste sur les guillemets), mais c'est moins vaseux sous prétexte qu'il y a un homme et une femme ? Pourtant, cet enfant sera baigné dans autant d'amour que celui qui a été fécondé dans une éprouvette, mais qui a été mis dans une famille hétéro...

Non c'est pas tout à fait la même chose. Dans la FIV ""classique"" on pallie à une étape du processus naturel qui ne fonctionne pas bien. On aide un peu la fécondation, le reste est on ne peut plus naturel.

Dans le cas d'un couple homosexuel, on ajoute une étape qui n'existait pas, que la nature n'a pas prévu. C'est là le point majeur.

Alors bien sûr, on contre la nature dans plein d'autres cas (traitement des insuffisants rénaux, des immuno déprimés, etc...) mais encore une fois on pallie à un défaut de la nature, on ne crée pas un nouveau process parallèle à la nature.

Je ne suis pas douée pour expliquer mon point mais le post de /u/fdurke l'explique parfaitement.

&gt;Un couple proche de ma famille à adopté une petite vietnamienne il y a 5-6 ans, lui avait déjà un fils d'un mariage précédent (déjà majeur), et il n'a pas pu avoir de deuxième enfant avec sa seconde femme. Ils ont essayé pendant des années, et ils ont adopté, alors qu'ils avaient tous les deux 45 ans bien tapés. La petite a été tellement désirée, que quand elle est arrivée le bonheur était réellement visible dans leur maison. C'était très attendrissant, et j'aurais trouvé ça incroyablement injuste qu'ils ne puissent pas concrétiser leur vœu le plus cher. C'est la même chose avec les homos. Le désir d'avoir des enfants est naturel, pourquoi le refuser ?

Le désir d'enfants est naturel certe mais faut-il aller contre nature pour le réaliser? Il reste l'adoption. Ils peuvent adopter dans ce cas comme les couples hétéro. Problème résolu.

&gt;C'est effectivement un argument pas très construit, mais ce sont des questions qu'on ne pose pas nécessairement avant de dormir et surtout pas quand on est pas trop concerné. Il faut y réfléchir un peu et se forger son opinion soi-même ce qui est parfois difficile dans des sujets qui sont plus ou moins tabous. Donc je comprends ;)

I'm still quite capable at finding reputable psychological studies which show (this is the consensus in the field - as far as I can tell) that children raised by same-sex couples are as healthy both mentally and physically as those raised by heterosexual parents. Given that trend of findings, don't you think that the burden of proof should lie with those who have opposing views, i.e., yourself?

http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20(1).pdf

&gt;CPA’s review of the psychological 
research led us to conclude that the children of same-sex parents do not differ from the children of 
heterosexual parents in terms of their psychosocial development, their gender development and 
their gender identity.
&gt;[...] the research on which opponents to 
marriage of same-sex couples rely, look at the functioning of children in intact families with 
heterosexual parents compared to those children raised by a single parent following divorce or 
death of a spouse. They do not include studies that compare the functioning of children raised by 
heterosexual couples with the functioning of children raised by same-sex couples. In this group of 
studies, any differences observed are more accurately attributable to the effects of death or 
divorce, and/or to the effects of living with a single parent, rather than to parents’ sexual 
orientation. These studies do not tell us that the children of same-sex parents in an intact 
relationship fair worse than the children of opposite-sex parents in an intact relationship. [...] The opposition to marriage of same-sex couples, on the grounds that it fails to consider the needs 
or rights of children, does not consider the most relevant body of psychological research into this 
topic or draws inaccurate conclusions from it.

http://www.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/LGBT-Families-Lit-Review.pdf

&gt;As detailed in this review, the family studies literature indicates that it is family processes (such as the 
quality of parenting and relationships within the family) that contribute to determining children’s wellbeing and ‘outcomes’, rather than family structures, per se, such as the number, gender, sexuality and 
co-habitation status of parents. The research indicates that parenting practices and children’s outcomes 
in families parented by lesbian and gay parents are likely to be at least as favourable as those in families 
of heterosexual parents, despite the reality that considerable legal discrimination and inequity remain 
significant challenges for these families

And also, i've checked out plenty of such studies myself, and each was complaining about limited sample pools and insufficient timespans for gathering detailed data.

In other words, you have no proof at all that kids grow up just as healthy and mentally diversified in both types of environments.

On the other hand, everyone knows about motherly instincts, chemical triggers, and so on.

For example, breast feeding, how the fuck, exactly, do you want 2 gay men to perform that? Hormonal treatment to stimulate glands? First of all the milk would be tainted with masculine ""elements"" and biochemical imbalances, 2nd of all, it wouldn't even be viable nutrient-wise - add psychological elements such as ""imprinting"" and so on and you'll soon realize why a proper Father/Mother environment will trump any LGBT any day.

Also, the problem with pretty much the majority of studies/research in this regard, is the fact that it looks at adoption, not impregnation - birth - development.

And we all (or at least, most) know that the first few months are critical in child development.

This also poses a nice problem with inequality between LGBT couples, 2 lesbians have no problems impregnating themselves and enjoying a child that is still ""them"", yet men? Artificial wombs are still decades away, and having some ""external"" female carry it and birth it is no different from treating a child like some product or animal raised for slaughter.

The fact that i need to point these things out is saddening.


Why don't you advocate sister-fucking or other heavy incest though? What's your rationale? Downs syndrome in offspring? - we all know this is blown out of proportion and actually requires generations of inbreeding to become a prevalent issue.

Hypocrisy is extremely annoying these days, and extremely prevalent.

And even then, fucking your sister would still be more natural than another man, both logic and nature wise (and yes we all know there are ""gay"" animals, except that's not the whole story - it usually involves hierarchy, deficiencies in the herd, parasites [yes, parasites] and so on - only a handful of examples show animals being gay just because.)

Either way, this ""research"" would require no less than human sacrifice, a child created and killed in order to prove or disprove a theory, no different from a lab rat.

EDIT: And on a last note, papers which use words such as ""likely"", ""possibly"", ""arguably"" are worthless in my eyes, solid research does not operate on ubiquitous words and colored bs. Either A=A or nothing, A does not ""possibly"" equal A.

Cmq il discorso introdotto da te:
&gt;Sfortunatamente l'idea che ""Laurea = Buon Lavoro"" è ancora troppo radicata

mi spinge ad affrontare il discorso che avevo introdotto prima:

&gt;Poi ci sarebbe da parlare della svalutazione della laurea dato l'estremamente facile accesso che esiste in Italia

Ormai ""Laurea= buon lavoro"" non vale piu', hai ragione, ma spesso vale il ""Buona laurea= buon lavoro"".

Mi spiego meglio... con il fatto che in Italia l'accesso alle lauree e' diventato cosi' facile a livello economico (rispetto all'estero) e troppo spesso anche a livello di difficolta', molti la vedono come naturale prosecuzione delle superiori, portandosi dietro quel ""tiriamo a campare"" tipico delle scuole italiane scegliendo i corsi in cui dovranno impegnarsi di meno e cosi' via...

Questo, invece che portare ad un numero immenso di bocciati, ha portato ad un abbassamento del livello di istruzione in alcuni corsi di laurea e la nascita di cosi' tanti corsi di laurea ""farlocchi"" che manco riesco a tenerne il conto, non c'e' da stupirsi che poi diciamo i laureati non trovano lavoro... laureati si', ma in cosa, come?

conosco persone laureate con una tesi su una mamma per amica o persone che non hanno l'intelligenza per cambiare una lampadina laureate in qualche laurea oscura...

&gt; ""Buon Lavoro = curiosità, passione, intelligenza, contatti, intraprendenza, voglia di fare, fortuna... e infine anche Laurea"".

Capisco che non possano essere tutte la Cuccarini o la Martinez dei bei tempi, ballerine con tutti i crismi, ma santoddio, ce ne sono di belle ragazze che sanno ballare in Italia!!Io disapprovo il velinaggio piú per il cringe estremo che induce per la goffaggine che per gambe e cosce,che manco noto,senza offesa alle signorine in questione. Il mio sogno é che esistano professionisti dello spettacolo in grado di ballare, cantare e recitare nel nostro Paese,come ce ne sono nel resto del mondo, e che siano loro a diventar famosi, non dei sacchi di patate col sorriso anche un po' creepy!

4- La tv del dolore. Interminabili pomeriggi a leggere i diari della povera Yara, che dal Paradiso ormai stará bestemmiando assieme alla povera Sarah, e a sentire le zie di secondo grado, i cugini, i vicini, tutti a dire cose irrilevanti.

Siamo uno dei paesi con il tasso di educazione terziaria più basso in assoluto in Europa. Quindi non è vero che 

&gt; molti la vedono [l'università ndr] come naturale prosecuzione delle superiori

Ecco qui le statistiche dell'Eurostat in proposito: Proportion of the population aged 30 to 34 having a tertiary educational attainment, 2011 - http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=File:Proportion_of_the_population_aged_30_to_34_having_a_tertiary_educational_attainment,_2011_(1)_(%25).png

&gt; Questo, invece che portare ad un numero immenso di bocciati, ha portato ad un abbassamento del livello di istruzione in alcuni corsi di laurea e la nascita di cosi' tanti corsi di laurea ""farlocchi""

Questo è un altro argomento - molto diffuso in Italia - completamente infondato. La laurea Italiana è una delle più difficile da raggiungere (non vuol dire che sia la più ""selettiva"" però, badate bene)

Dati recenti mostrano che il passaggio da educazione secondaria a l'educazione terziaria è molto basso, si era alzato un po' dopo la riforma del 3+2 ma non troppo ed ora è ripiombato. Inoltre chi arriva alla fine dell'università sono davvero pochissimi.

Il vero problema è che in Italia in genere non c'è bisogno di laureati, perché il tessuto produttivo non ha bisogno di gente ad ""alto valore aggiunto"".

In Italia si sente spesso dire che ci sono troppi laureati. Allora vorrei puntualizzare: sì, sono troppi per il tipo di economia che abbiamo. Ma non sono troppi in assoluto, anzi, sono davvero pochi!

Fate Laureati (numeratore) / Economia (denominatore). Il problema italiano non è l'alto numeratore (numero di laureati), ma il basso denominatore (bisogni dell'economia reale).

Questo perché l'Italia è un'economia arretrata in molti campi.

(Ho potuto confermare questo nel mio campo guardando programmi di corso e testi di esami in archivio ma anche in altre facolta' sembrano confermare.)

Il secondo argomento, le lauree farlocche... beh, tristemente posso confermare anche questo.. avendo amiche laureate con tesi su una mamma per amica... oppure corsi di laurea poco significativi o poco challenging (facevo ripetizioni di matematica e informatica a ragazzi di scienze della comunicazione e vi giuro che, vi giuro che.... aaaaAAAAH!!)

Questo per cercare di dare un respiro piu' ampio al mio pensiero...

In the middle ages they were bloodthirsty pagan vikings and murderers. They became christian vikings and murderers in around 10th century. Then they had some kind of Union of the nordic states.

In WWII they were neutral, but a surprisingly large number of Swedes were enamored of Nazi ideals and served in SS. After the war they pretended they never liked Hitler, changed their driving order from left to right, and joined the EU, roughly in that order.

selbstverständlich ist SPRINGER radikal, sonst würde man ja mal über die rechtmäßigkeit des mediums sprechen können.
z.b.: wieso geht das verfahren gegen die anführerin in bezug auf die unrechtmäßige enteignung der leiblichen söhne axel springers nicht weiter?
Friede Springer hat keine eigenen Kinder mit Axel Springer nachdem sie dessen erste Ehe zerstört hat, nach seinem Tod hat sie in einer bis heute nicht geklärten nacht&amp;nebel aktion die leiblichen Kinder beklaut; geholfen hat ihr dabei der Axel Springer Vorstand.
Eigentlich dürfte ein Verlag nicht existieren, wenn er sich nicht an die Gesetze des Landes hält, nur leider sind die Seilschaften in die CDU hinein zu ""intensiv"" für eine legale Existenz.

Wie hieß noch der Typ, der früher die Fickeltexte für die Seite1 Girls geschrieben hat und heute in der CDU Führungsebene ist? Eeeegal.

Rechtsradikalismus beginnt doch nicht beim Werfen von Molotowcocktails, sondern in dem Moment wo man Gesetze bricht um faschistische Ideen durchzusetzen, wie z.B. die Ablehnung der Homoehe von Springer. Hier werden Menschenrechte (Gleichbehandlung!) und europaisches Recht verletzt und das ist rechts &amp; radikal. 
Man sollte Friede Springer wegsprerren, so lange sie noch lebt.

La denuncia (legittima perchè comunque si tratta di furto) funziona da deterrente solo nel momento in cui viene pubblicizzata.

Il mio discorso è: posto che si tratta di una cifra irrisoria (10€ di spesa) e considerate le motivazioni del ladro, probabilmente sarebbe stato meglio lasciare andare il signore, facendogli lasciare lì la merce rubata, senza dover scomodare le forze dell'ordine, secondo una legge del normale buonsenso e umanità.

Ognuno deve difendersi, questo è vero, ma la catena in questione cosa ci guadagna nel mandare in carcere un povero cristo per 10€?

E' una ottima ipotesi in effetti.

Come puoi immaginare, ci sono palate di studi sull'argomento. Ma gli studi si focalizzano di più sulle caratteristiche anagrafiche degli studenti che abbandonano più su quello che si fa dentro l'università. 

Insomma, i ricercatori sono più interessati a sapere *chi* abbandona piuttosto *perché* si abbandona.

Ma certo sapendo chi [hint: i poveri] puoi già tirare qualche conclusione sulla tua ipotesi.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; That is what austerity is all about, to force government departments to reduce their waste, because there just is no money they can waste. Greece is not the only country who has to go though this. Germany did it 10 years ago. Only that the Greek government takes way longer than anybody else to get it right. Unfortunately.

That's a convenient interpretation of the crisis but it doesn't hold to scrutiny. First, if you look at the targets that the troika sets for Greece, you'll see that bureaucracy, nepotism, corruption etc are hardly even mentioned and when they are it's only in broad terms. ""Waste"" is used as an euphemism for cutting back on essential public services like schools and hospitals. If austerity really was about that, then the conditions for dispersing the loan tranches would reflect this. 

Second, Germany did not ""reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and nepotism"". They just decreased their wages to become more competitive. In effect, they also decreased global demand but they didn't care about that because the global economy was booming at the time. It's essentially a beggar-thy-neighbour strategy. Greece has already decreased its wage costs by much more than Germany did and is not seeing any of the benefits because the global economy is contracting. 

Third, why are you only talking about Greece? What about Spain? Ireland? Portugal? Their problems were smaller to begin with but they have not ""gotten it right"" yet by any stretch of the imagination. Your narrative is full of inconsistencies.

nowadays brazilian mothers can't afford real milk anymore as the local farmers could not compete with that. therfor you can only buy milk powder. that kills newborns EVERY DAY. FUCK YOU ARLA!

true,[deleted],null,null,"OK here is my take, it is mostly history and politics, as these are my interests:

- The reason Sweden is famous about social democracy is that the Swedish kind of capitalism was different than others. It was not as much about entrepreneurship, self made men, and suchlike, but more like business owners and government being all cozy with each other down in Stockholm, while workers working up there in the cold northern mining towns being angry. So it was a situation where it was hard to see the market economy as freedom. So it gave an early start to social democracy.

- Today, the interesting thing is that because the experiment is a long run one, the faults of social democracy become clear earlier than in many other countries, and from the eighties on, much more market freedom was brought back. And actually in some areas they went further to roll back the state and implement market freedom than countries that were originally less socialist. A good example is school vouchers. In most countries if you want to send your kids to a private school, you pay for it, but you also pay tax for public education which you do not use. This is not entirely fair, and it makes private schools exclusive for the rich, and hard to compete with. School vouchers means the state decides how much to spend on public education per child, and basically if you go and pay for a private school instead then pays this money for that too, and you pay only the difference.  Sweden implemented something like this. This is a very pretty antisocialism, market freedom kind of idea.

What seems outrageously autoritharian from Germany, hardly moves an average Hungarian. They care about jobs, taxes, prices, healthcare, public safety, education, corruption but not really about such subtleties whether the constitutional court can investigate changes of the constitution itself or not. I bet half of them doesn't even know what the constitutional court is. Once I dated a girl who was a medical student, also really bright and educated in arts and history and had absolutely know idea who the PM was or what was the difference between the PM and the president. The apathy towards politics is incredible. (Reddit might give you a false impression.) Half of the voters (including myself) - who actually could easily make this government go - cannot find a party the'd vote for.


This is a rather lengthy, detailed history of the battle between the conctitutional court and the government, in case you were interested:


*""God save us from people with good intentions.""*


Actually the constitutional court (CC) has been always a battleground between political groups, under each government. Its task is to filter out the stupid ideas of the government that don't agree with the constitution. It's not quintessential, but knowing how short-sighted our politicians can be, it's a good thing to have. However, this government had a vision about how to make the country flourishing again, restart the economy etc. (all the good intentions) and deemed the extensive rights of the CC to be an obstacle in the way of the future. 

As they also happened to get a 2/3 majority at the elections - because the socialists were so widely hated, for a reason - they were able to change certain rules: first they made it possible to elect members of the CC without the opposition's cooperation. Then they elected two new members who they preferred. One of them (István Stumpf) was especially criticised as he didn't have an expertise in law an had close relationship with Orbán. Interestingly, he took his job rather seriously and didn't assist to the government's plans. 


The first confrontation was the case of 98% special taxes. Some friends of the previous 'regime' got golden handshakes when their service ended or were fired from well-paid positions for various reasons. These were well-known examples of the proliferating corruption under the socialists. So the government decided to get back some of this money, not because the amount actually mattered, rather to please voters. They passed a bill that charged all the severance payments of civil servants back to 2005 with a special tax of 98% if the amount exceeded a certain limit and ""were against good morals"". The CC of course rejected it, saying it applied to rightfully given severance payments too. So they changed the constitution so that the CC couldn't annull taxation laws anymore, unless they violate fundamental human rights. (In the meantime complaints against other new taxes were also submitted to the CC.) Nevertheless the CC rejected it again, saying it was *ex post facto*, and as such, incomprehensible with fundamental human rights. So finally they needed to limit the law's scope to payments made after 2009. That went through the CC, but in one case it was rejected by the European Court of Human Rights a few weeks ago, as it 'violates the *right to property*' and there're more ongoing lawsuits. So the government will either appeal or pay a compensation.

As I remember, their argument was *""we need to limit the rights of the CC because the parliament represents the people's will and sense of justice and it's not acceptable that a comittee completely overwrites that""* or something similar. 

Later the CC annulled the law that allowed to fire the employees of government offices without giving a formal explanation why. (They wanted to reduce the numbers as a measure of austerity.) The government accepted the decision.


Then, in the making of the new constitution, they enlarged the CC with 4 new members. Also, the new constitution changed the legal procedures and scope of the CC quite a lot, this time without big scandals. 

The CC then annulled a bunch of new laws about churches, media and juries. However, the government announced days before the decision that it'll withdraw and modify those laws, so it was apparent that someone from the CC is informing the government about the upcoming decisions. 

Once again, one of the annulled laws - the public prosecutor can choose the jury he/she wants to try the suspect - was re-accepted, this time as a ""transitional measure of the Constitution"" so the CC couldn't examine it. (a special legal category invented for this purpose)



The following big confrontation was the case of student contracts, which finally led to the widely criticised *4th amendment of the constitution*. Much as other countries, we're struggling to finance the higher education. So far it was free for most students. First the government reduced the number of students who can get free higher education, then they introduced the 'student contract': students receiving free education had to sign a contract in which they agree that after receiving their degrees they'll work in Hungary for some years or pay back the tuition fees. The CC annulled the law. 

The CC also anulled the law that defined the 'family' as a the marriage between man and woman, the law that criminalised 'using public areas for living' i.e. homelessness, then the annulled a bunch of the ""transitional measures of the Constitution"", saying they weren't transitional, including the reduction of retiring age of judges and prosecuting attorneys, the law of mandatory registration of voters, etc.


So the government got pissed off and with the 4th amendment they put many of the previously annulled laws right into the constitution and introduced some new ones as well. So now the CC cannot examine the amendments of constitution, laws regarding certain public finance matters (e.g. special taxes). Also the CC's older decisions were repealed - although their legal consequences weren't - so the new loyal members don't need to consider to them precedents.


The amendment resulted in demonstrations (altohugh not really big ones, few thousand people), and heavy criticism from abroad. Also there was a row between a prominent politician of the ruling party and the aforementioned member of the CC, the former advisor of Orbán who's become a critic.


As I said, most people don't care, they consider it ""legal fiddling"". The dismemberment of the CC's rights wont be the thing that causes the Fidesz to loose the elections.

Mein Dilemma endete erst, zwei ausländische Frauen, von denen eine hochschwanger (!) war, sich scheinbar auf arabisch absprachen und bei mir an der nächsten Station dann signalisierten schnell auszusteigen, währends die beiden den Mann in der U-Bahn zurückhielten, bis sich die Türe schlossen.

&gt;Let me lay out an analogy for you. Say you're a fat person and someone insults you because of that. It's their right to say that about you, or to you, that doesn't mean you're any less offended when they do it. 

I was talking about laws. How is being fat a debate over something? Is being fat a law?
Being fat is being fat. Being gay is being gay. There is now analogy what so ever. 

The protest is about a law. I said i don't care what law is. The law wasn't before. They are protesting against it. There were no protests before this law. France had gay parades before and there were no other anti-gay rallies.

I know how reddit works but why is it so hard to understand that this is a law debate more or less. You are trying to turn this in some anti-gay rally. These people protest a law that wasn't before.

To clear something up. I do not care about gay laws in general so if a state has or hasn't is really not my concern, I'm not french. I don't really understand why people are so up their ass and offended by protesting a law that wasn't before.

Sorry for repeating myself. But there is bigotry on both parts and you both fuel them instead of being reasonable.
If this was a protest for another law like gun law reddit would salute them and some would feel offended if their guns were taken away. This is an analogy. Not a description of a person when talking about a law. You don't have to be gay to get gay-married. 

So stop this bigotry on both parts. Trying to claim a perfectly democratic practice like a rally against a **Law** insulting is really too low even for reddit.

Plain simply if you want to be a truly traditionalist, nationalist, conservative Dane, you need to go from atheist to ""atheist Lutheran"", in France from atheist to ""atheist Catholic"" and so on. Because this is part of your national identity. Faith is not necessary, but identity is.

How does this actually work?

They enjoy state-favouritism and they even are the official religion in some countries (eg Greece). 

They routinely codify their beliefs into law or manage to redirect law proposals into oblivion because of their influence.

Clergy and people close to clergy often incite attacks which disrupt other people's businesses, and sometimes go violent. Few months ago, in Greece, priests, far-right MPs and people belonging to Christian groups attacked a theatre for displaying a play with gay characters. The actors where chased out of the premises and the play was cancelled. They made a move to charge the actors for blasphemy too, but I didn't read any follow up on that. It was not the first incident of that kind, just the most recent.

They successfully persecuted a Pastafarian for blasphemy though last year, in Greece. The case is in courts.  

In Cyprus, the Church is much more wealthy than the state, and the state submits to their whims in exchange for the Church running charities (since most of the welfare system was dismantled). In Greece the Church was connected to shady businesses, including helping convicted criminals to get away with stuff, selling state property and hiding the money in off-shore companies. Their salary is paid by tax money.

In those countries more than 80% considers themselves religious and Orthodoxs, and about half of them are regularly going to church. 

Religion, as in *confession of Christian fate* is a subject in schools and in some countries it is particularly difficult to opt-out if you are not Christian (there's is an ongoing case in Cyprus, a school discriminating against a non-Christian student who choose to opt-out from RE).

Talking about Cyprus in specific, I don't see any change in 20 years time.

This segregation is the result of several factors: ethnic clustering, but also the traditional Dutch ""pillar model"", wherein ""special schools"" run by religious communities (mostly Protestant and Catholic schools) are funded by the state just like public schools. Most, if not all, ""black schools"" are public schools, while ""special schools"", unsurprisingly, tend to have quite low intake rates among minorities.
Furthermore, the Dutch have a selective secondary education system, with pupils put on different tracks from age 12. Statistically, pupils from ""black schools"" are extremely unlikely to be put on the track for higher education.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Wages depend much more on ""Aggregate Demand"" than the whole financial market. 

If consumption goes down, unemployment arise and the savings rate drop.

This will create a deflation and then a recession, that is what many economies in Europe are experiencing today (not only Spain and Greece, but also France and the NL, for example). 

The textbook solution to avoid a depression and unemployment, is to inflate money a bit. With cheaper money, deleveraging is more easy. Entrepreneurs are happy, people start to consume again, job are created and so on.

So, in Europe right now Inflation is painfully too low, but unfortunately - as this american economist says - [Mrs. Merkel Lives in a World of Her Own](http://uneasymoney.com/2013/04/26/mrs-merkel-lives-in-a-world-of-her-own/).

I will paste it:

&gt; Her message is: “Look, if I had my way, I would raise interest rates, forcing an even deeper recession and even more pain on the rest of you moochers. But, tender-hearted softy that I am, I am not going to do that. I will settle for keeping the ECB lending rate at its current level, or maybe, if you bow and scrape enough, I might, just might, allow the ECB to cut the rate by a quarter of a percent. But don’t think for even a minute that I am going to allow the ECB to follow the Fed and the Bank of Japan in adopting any kind of radical, inflationist quantitative easing.”

&gt; So the current German rate of inflation of 1-2% is too high for Mrs. Merkel. The adjustment in relative prices between Germany and the rest of Eurozone requires that prices and wages in the rest of the Eurozone fall relative to prices and wages in Germany. Mrs. Merkel says that she will not allow inflation in Germany to go above 1-2%. What does that say about what must happen to prices and wages in the rest of the Eurozone? Do the math. So if Mrs. Merkel has her way — and she clearly speaks with what Mark Twain once called “the calm confidence of a Christian holding four aces” – things will continue to get worse, probably a lot worse, in the Eurozone before they get any better. Get used to it.

tl;dr: protecting savers and workers from inflation is stupid when there are no savers and workers anymore.",0,1369668617,null,0,1369669291,0,ca6vbyu,t3_1f4q18,t1_ca6vbyu,t1_ca6v2jz,null,1431018070,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Basically every time I referred to secularism in my previous post, I was sort of referring to Atheism. Which is a mistake. 

Secularism is (from what I understand) more akin to agnosticism. It's not necessarily a belief in anything. It's all about impartiality and indifference. The state is secular (in most western countries), but **not** Atheist. The state (in most western democracies) is *neutral* in matters of religion. It is indifferent. It is not Atheist which means that the state would actively promote being non religious *which it doesn't*.

Pour mes sources, c'est [cette enquête du mois dernier aux US](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/03/01/gay-couples-more-educated-higher-income-than-heterosexual-couples) :

&gt;Among same-sex couples with both partners in the labor force, median household income is significantly higher ($94,000) than among heterosexual couples ($86,000). That's likely due to a number of factors, but education is likely one of them, says Gary Gates, a distinguished scholar at the Williams institute and the study's author. Around 46 percent of people in same-sex couples have college degrees, compared to under one-third of people in heterosexual couples. That higher level of education also likely contributes to higher incomes for same-sex households.

On a exactement les mêmes chiffres en France, avec 40% de diplômes du supérieur chez les homosexuels, contre 24% pour les hétéros.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Interest rates are at a record low and have been for years. I really don't see how money could get any cheaper.

I will quote the good old Milton Friedman on that (so, somebody who *really* hated inflation), on what he calls ""The Interest Rate Fallacy"".

Talking about Japan and the crisis of '29, Friedman said:

&gt; The Fed pointed to low interest rates as evidence that it was following an easy money policy and never mentioned the quantity of money. The governor of the Bank of Japan, in a speech on June 27, 1997, referred to the ""drastic monetary measures"" that the bank took in 1995 as evidence of ""the easy stance of monetary policy."" He too did not mention the quantity of money. Judged by the discount rate, which was reduced from 1.75 percent to 0.5 percent, the measures were drastic. Judged by monetary growth, they were too little too late, raising monetary growth from 1.5 percent a year in the prior three and a half years to only 3.25 percent in the next two and a half.

&gt; After the U.S. experience during the Great Depression, and after inflation and rising interest rates in the 1970s and disinflation and falling interest rates in the 1980s, **I thought the fallacy of identifying tight money with high interest rates and easy money with low interest rates was dead**. Apparently, old fallacies never die.

And indeed, old fallacies never die! You were so right, dear Milton. (we miss you!) [here the full article](http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/6549).

What Friedman is trying to say? It's trying to break the fallacious idea that ""low interests rate"" = ""easy money"".

On the contrary: he says that low interest rate over a long period are exactly a signal that money is too thigh, not too easy!!!

Unfortunately, people will never understand that: during the crisis of '29 republicans said that the crisis was because money was too easy, and they rose interest rate. So the crisis lasted 10 years more, during the '30s.

Dann das Mädchen ruhig zu sich ziehen.
Man muss gar nicht groß provozieren oder drohen. Meist reicht es einfach zu signalisieren, dass die Anwesenden diese Verhalten nicht billigen und hinter dem Opfer stehen. In einer *vollen* Sbahn ist das mehr als genug.

Selbst als Frau bin ich teilweise gerade bei Jugendlichen öfters dazuwischen gegangen. Meist reicht es einfach mit ruhiger Stimme hinzugehen, das Opfer etwas beiseite zuschieben und mit ganz ruhiger Stimme etwas Richtung ""Komm, das muss jetzt nicht sein."" zu den Tätern zu sagen. Wenn man mit Freunden unterwegs ist, das Opfer dann zwischen die eigene Gruppe setzen oder von mir aus zwischen eine unbekannte, möglichst männliche Gruppe, der man kurz signalisiert, was gefordert ist. Das reicht in den allermeisten Fällen schon um die Täter zu demotivieren. In meinem Fall, war es schon ausreichend, dass die Frauen sich vor ihn stellten und ""Lass sie in Ruhe."" sagten.

Es gibt immer etwas was man hätte tun könnte, auch ohne sich selbst in Gefahr zu begeben. Und sei es, dass man schnell die Nummer der Bahnhofspolizei o.äh. per Smartphone sucht und sie fragt, was zu tun ist. Im vorliegenden Fall war die Situation wie es scheint bedrohend genug und zog sich wohl auch über einen längere Zeitdauer hin, wenn es für vier Tweets plus Photo reicht.


Bezüglich der Sache mit den Behörden kann ich es mir vorstellen, dass sie wohl eher Angst hätte, dass sobald die Männer ihren vollen Namen in Folge der Anzeige ihren vollen Namen wüssten, sie ihr auflauern könnten, um sich für die Anzeige gleich mal zu *bedanken*.

No matter that what he said goes against mainstream economist thought, was aimed at a completely different era, policy and - most importantly - global economy.

But even if I take what he says as a gospel, then I still don't see how that changes anything. What you are doing is replacing one assumption with another. Low interest rates should - so conventional thought - make credit cheap and decrease the incentive to just store your money at the bank. Higher inflation rates should pretty much do the same thing because it becomes equally undesirable NOT to invest money in the ""real"" economy. You are right when you point out how cheap money is not equal with easy money. But that doesn't mean inflation will change that one bit. What is missing is investor confidence - and that has nothing to do with inflation and everything with trust in the political process and the ability of the troubled nations to reform themselves. Spain, Portugal, Greece have loads iof money - they just don't invest that in their own economy and buy apartments in Berlin instead.

true,satez,SWED,Sweden,"The School vouching system has largely been a failure so far though.

1. It has been concluded that it has severely increased the segregation of our society, in the same study by our government that the segregation actually lowers the overall performance of the students. 

2. When the conservatives won big in 2006 the started selling out schools (and lots of other stuff, mostly for symbolic prices), this meant that the percentage private schools increased a lot. These privately owned schools have less teachers and pay them less. Their pitch is a ton of marketing, brand building and gimmicks like free laptop or english only education/being sport oriented/no homework/school starts later in the day. The grades from their schools very often deviate from the standardized testing results that often seems like they're giving the students higher grades than they do deserve. The municipality who's in charge and pays for the student check can't really check what the money goes into since school corporations just declare their whole operation without showing the specific schools.

3. As you can see these are largely issues of how the administrate schooling and not so much about *how to teach* - the benefits of standardized testing and how to better educate our youth. This is the real victim of Swedens 20 year long debate about how to administrate schooling - real progress in education policy. Cause by all measurements our students have a worse education now, than in the 80:s. 

Some like to believe that you can blame the so called ""kommunalisering"" (municipalities taking over the control over the schools in their area) for this, but you really can't blame it. It had to happen since it fixed tons of stupid bureaucratic questions, but in turn came with a few problems that could have been easily fixed if we weren't debating administration (in a very central way).

Democracy by definition has to preserve itself so that people can be free to protest. Protests can't be used as a tool to end the right to protest, which is what those people want.

Long answer: hmmm. People don't react well to charity in the long run. Firstly, feeling useless breeds contempt. We'd be willfully producing a class of people whose sense of self-worth would be slowly ground down, because the best we could offer that way would be relative material comfort which is, demonstrably, not enough. People and peoples have their pride, after all. Secondly, that relative comfort would, in the short run, lower the urgency of fixing the state and the economy, further prolonging their suffering.

The 'slow' austerity is quite horrible in that sense as well. Take Greece, for example. For too long now every year has been worse for the people than the last one. Not much worse, but noticeably so. That's long enough to start feeling as if that pattern will continue indefinitely.

true,turnusb,CHIN,China,"I'm not saying the west should go bomb Islamistan with democracy. I'm saying that anti-democratic movements can't use democratic tools to abolish democracy, ie. a bunch of people can't expect to abolish democracy through rioting, when all they're doing is using their democratic right to riot. Democracy isn't meant to destroy itself via absurdist fallacies (ie. using democratic rights to end democracy).

Democracy isn't about the rule of the majority, it's about the plurality of the people. The rule of the majority is a consequence of that plurality's self-organization. That rule can only be applied in a democracy, so the rulers have to be democratic, therefore democracy can't let undemocratic groups rise to power through democratic means.

This has nothing to do with intelligence. I believe everyone has the right to be equally free. Only democracy can deliver that freedom. Democracy is self-preserving, it ends when you try to abolish it democratically. We have seen what the rise to power through democratic means of anti-democratic rulers has accomplished. Nothing but destruction. 

So if you want to destroy democracy, then feel free to start a revolution. We'll see where those millions of people, that majority of the people, are then.",0,1369683779,null,0,false,0,ca6zxzr,t3_1f4vjv,t1_ca6zxzr,t1_ca6zh9l,null,1431015824,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

I hope you'll develop a taste for cheese and if you do you will come to understand how difficult it is to respond to your question with exactitude.  In French: *ça depend* ;] 

example for the camembert type - it depends on it's stage at the  moment you bought it, you must have already seen  customers opening the boxes and using a thumb to test the maturity of the camembert? A visual inspection once the lid is opened tells already how mature the cheese is, but the thumb thing is an accepted custom. Don't buy one that has the wrapping paper stuck to the surface of the cheese, the fluffy growing on the surface is one of the pleasures when biting into a camembert. An uniform white colour indicates a young cheese, a relatively aged one will have dark parallel lines on it's surface and those marks become darker and darker with time passing. Observe the periphery too, the area where the lid rests on the cheese.

*au lait cru, fermier, A.O.C (Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée)* are the key words to watch for on the packaging.

You know there are countries that don't allow you to offend people. That's way CEOs or politicians don't insult themselves. Just because in the street someone can insult you it's totally different.

&gt;underlying motives

You are no better than the ones protesting putting wood in a fire won't extinguish it.

&gt;If their was a good reason for protesting the law

Wait so not agreeing with gay adoption or what they want is not a good reason for them or in general? Weird. So by that something that will change their society even if it's good or worse is not reasonable.. Ok...

&gt;When you are a member of that group and you see hundreds of thousands of people protesting against you having equal rights you have a right to be offended.

Unlike you, i actually read about this and there are gays that are against the law. Why aren't they offended? Because it's a law. This law wasn't before. They don't protest against the group why is it so hard to understand. They protest against the law. My earlier post didn't even make a point to you did it?

&gt;Their reasons for doing it are though.

How so? As i said above it's a law that wasn't before and it ~~might~~will change their society.
People sometimes want change and sometimes people don't.
I don't want the internet to become more controlled with laws and i will protest against it and these people don't want a gay marriage law. I'm not going to protest against the internet and they aren't going to protest against gays.. They protest against gay marriage law and i will against an internet control act. Do more research please.

&gt;because something is democratic that doesn't make it right nor does it mean that a significant proportion can't be on the wrong side of the argument

This is the definitive proof that you didn't read anything about this or democratic practices in general. Especially the first part of the statement. There is no right or wrong side here.. It's a LAW. This law grants something not bans it.

When you make a law the only part of the right or wrong is when you break a law and are in for a fine or punishment. A marriage law in general is not right or wrong either is it gay or straight marriage... How can you classify marriage in general as wrong or right?

As i stated before try to read it even though it's confusing. I'm sure they aren't there to protest because they hate gays but because they don't agree with the law.",0,1369684072,null,0,false,0,ca7019k,t3_1f3dip,t1_ca7019k,t1_ca6yqdp,null,1431015781,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Personally I'd do Granada over Sevilla.  Forget Majorca, its an island and a totally separate trip.

Your trip will be so rushed. Whereas to enjoy Spain you've got to be Tranquilo!

You want to experience real spain? Get out of the big cities and head for a smaller town.  I can only speak for Southern Spain where I live, but try La Linea de la Concepcion on the border of Gibraltar.  Authentic tapas bars, and a bit of poverty to go with it. Somewhere the crises has really hit hard.  But they know how to party on fiestas like Domingo Rociero. (sadly you won't be here for that)

September is a little late for Fair season. But they really get some of the typical Andalusian charm with salsa dancing in the casitas (tents), and lots of street parties and parades going on.

Forget Madrid. It's boring. Toledo is good, Cordoba is good. But check out some of the towns around it, like Montero. Very beautiful and off the tourist track.

Forget the Costa Del Sol.. Fuengirola, Marbella, etc.  Superficial crap the lot of it, and full of British bars.  Instead head up the Costa De La Luz. Up to Conil. That's where the Spanish go on holiday.

So, to recap if it was me. Fly to Barcelona, do a day or two there, then head to Cordoba, and visit some of its surrounding towns as well. Then hit Granada. Do the Alhambra (but book tickets in advance if you want to go inside the palace). Go see the Morrocan side of Granada as well, it is very good. Then head to La Linea, pop into Gibraltar for a day just to experience a bit of Britain in the Mediterranean, and a change of flavour. Then head west up the coast towards Cadiz.
