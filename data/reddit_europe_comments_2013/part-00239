Second generation migrants will be more radical than their parents. This is a consequence of 21^st century tribalism and the lack of structure in society.

It's just how society organizes itself. And when under pressure, these situations will happen more and more. It happens across in all primate societies, humans included. Signs of innate and embedded group behavior.

Multiculturalism is a catalyst for strife. Only when economic conditions are excellent do these tone down, but even then, they don't fade.

It can be seen as racist or just pernicious to admit it, but what should happen is just keep minorities what they are - minorities.

If the Global Scale Weights of just the OTs and CDs were added together (24% of global total), and then combined either with their average secrecy score of 70 or their lowest common denominator score of 80 (Bermuda), the United Kingdom with its satellite secrecy jurisdictions would be ranked first in the FSI by a large margin with a FSI score of 2162 or 3170, respectively (compared to 1765 for Switzerland). Note that this list excludes many British Commonwealth Realms where the Queen remains their head of state.

FSI is not about banks not telling where they got their money. It's *much* more than that. The FAQ explains what it is and why it matters.

I have encountered him twice, first time i had been partying all night at the beach clubs and was talking with a girl when he comes up to me and asks if i want to come/join his salsa club and starts dancing.
He starts to put his leg in my crouch and i push him away as a reaction, then he continues with the same procedure asking why i'm so mad and suddenly he has my phone in his hand.
Thankfully the girl notices and takes it directly, me myself didn't notice anything and i when i realized i didn't know how to react.

Second encounter he was on the Rambla and walked towards my buddy and before he got closer then one meter from me i put my hand on his chest and pushed away.

* DEVELOPING STORY: An 18-year old conscript committed suicide early Saturday, during his guard duty using his army rifle. The boy requested a leave for the weekend after basic training was concluded 'for important personal reasons', something that is usually arranged for all conscripts who just finished basic training. The request was turned down, and the boy announced that he plans to kill himself. To that announcement, the higher ups replied by giving the leave days on paper, but punishing him for the weekend, so not only he remains in the camp, but also his fixed number of allowed leave days is reduced. [No link because as of yet all articles publish the photo and full name of the deceased, which I  find unacceptable this early on]

* EU Council of Ministers says Cyprus was under extra scrutiny for “facilitating tax-evasion” in order to justify the harsh terms imposed by Troika. Cyprus actually ranked 41th in 2013 Tax Heavens list (out of 82 countries), newspaper notes that Germany ranks 8th [[P1]](http://www.politisnews.eu/cgibin/hweb?-A=249719&amp;-V=articles) [[P2]](http://www.politisnews.eu/cgibin/hweb?-A=249873&amp;-V=articles)

* A company named “FOCUS”, owned by a friend of notorious Greek banker Vgenopoulos (implicated in Laiki-CPB mismanagement and eventual collapse), wired 2 million EUR to funds of political parties in 2007-2008. The same company is involved into wiring 1 million to a company owner by ex-President of Cyprus Central Bank [[P]](http://www.politisnews.eu/cgibin/hweb?-A=249719&amp;-V=articles) (the underlying accusation here being that Vgenopoulos bribed his way out of banking surveillance, which eventually crashed the whole economy)

* A provisional agreement to make the Cyprus Turkish Football Association (CTFA) a member of FIFA and UEFA-eligible Cyprus Football Association (CFA) was signed in Zurich. This will open the doors for Turkish Cypriots to participate in international events - but no matches between the two communities [[FIFA]](http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=2218369/?intcmp=fifacom_hp_module_media_statements).

* Man who kept 3 manual labourers as slaves was sentenced to 2 months in prison. He kept the three men in a hut in the demilitarisation zone, had them work in his fields for 12 hours a day for 7 days a week for 450EUR/month, and since he had them live in a no-mans-land, they were far away from stores where they could buy food. The “owner” actively tried to stop the three men from contacting the authorities, and the Court found that he exploited their fear of unemployment to control them [[Ph]](http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/koinonia-eidiseis/160/170129/eiche-gia-doulous-treis-ergazomenous-kai-fylakistike)

* Non-legally sanctioned surrogate pregnancy 'shocks society'. Biological and step-fathers arrested, as well as the doctor, for participating in an illegal adoption. Cyprus lacks the legal framework to regulate surrogate parenthood and in-vitro fertilisation – the relevant law is stalled in the relevant Parliamentary Committee for years due to Church's objections [[Ph]](http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/top-stories/885/170664/gennise-kai-poulise-to-paidi-se-zevgari)

* One of the anti-drafting law the government tries to reintroduce will be voted upon soon. The specific law will exclude men who were discharged from the Cyprus National Guard (a conscription army) on psychological grounds (ie from severe anxiety to “gender anomaly”) from getting a public or semi-public sector job, and also mandate that the reason of discharge will be again printed on the discharge document, in an effort to discourage private companies from hiring them. This law was struck down a decade ago for not complying with the patient's privacy protection laws. Psychologists condemned this move, as it further stigmatises mental health history and wrongly assumes that a person who cannot function in a militaristic environment is generally unable to work in other environments. Other laws that are considered to be reintroduced include gun permits and driving licenses.

The station received so many complaints, especially from parents, despite the couple not even holding hands on screen, it was just them saying they are gay.

Nope. They got demonized pretty much the moment they mentioned immigration. As politicians in other parties who did it before them did and Ny Demokrati in the 90s did.

&gt;there has been controvery after controversy about them over how crazily racist they are 

Funny considering most of them haven't said anything more bigoted than you tend to do when talking about Scandinavians. The few local politicians who have made racist comments have been instantly excluded from the party over them due to SD's non-tolerance stance on racism.

&gt;where even their supposedly respectable MPs run around harassing foreign-looking people with slurs and blunt objects

You mean the case where two got drunk, got into a verbal fight with a kurdish stand-up comedian known for his attacks on SD and said he had picked up the iron pipe to fend off any would-be attackers after they got threatened with retaliation from a well-known organized criminal gang?   

That led to them getting expelled from their posts and the guy with the pipe was expelled from the party pretty much immediately. SD even soared in the ratings because of how incredibly well they handled the aftermath when the media was trying with immense glee to paint them all out as thugs when anyone with eyes can see that they're not.

&gt;let alone dozens of other incidents over the past decade. 

Name some. It'd be interesting to what else you think you know.

&gt;A significant portion of the party has tried to play off as reasonable immigration critics, but at it's core it's populated by violent thugs. 

Your ignorance of the subject is shining through.

&gt;It's the same kind of fascist thuggery that Golden Dawn is known for, such as physically assaulting female members of the opposition during a live debate

Because SD is so well known for physical assaults. They have all of, what is it now, zero attacks made on anyone?

&gt;That led to them getting expelled from their posts and the guy with the pipe was expelled from the party pretty much immediately. SD even soared in the ratings because of how incredibly well they handled the aftermath when the media was trying with immense glee to paint them all out as thugs when anyone with eyes can see that they're not.

These weren't just nobodies. There were the **economics** and **justice** spokespeople. Pretty high up the food chain people. You can try and whitewash it with 'oh, they were just some bad apples', but it's actually a systemic infection of the entire joke of a political party. There's a reason every other party in parliament outright refuses to associate with them to the point that the opposition votes in favour of government bills to make sure that SD hasn't had a controlling say, and that's because the party is rotten to the very fucking core. The leaders of SDs youth wing wrote in support of the two, saying they shouldnt have caved into media pressure and removed them. 

Regardless, these fucking thugs **weren't even expelled from the party**, they were just removed from prominent posts. No, they don't expel violent racists and thugs from the party, they only push people out of the party for 'alcoholism' such as with William Petzäll. Of course, I heard the real reason from one of my right leaning Swedish friends was because he was for the decriminalization of drugs, but whatever. Running around abusing strangers, threatening people with lead pipes is for more acceptable, civilized behaviour than alcohlism, no? 

&gt;Name some. It'd be interesting to what else you think you know.

What I think I know? Well, there's [this other MP from the SD](http://www.thelocal.se/20130426/47570) who refers to darker skinned people as monkeys. 

Then there's the charming story of the SD MP who [claimed to have been robbed and mugged by immigrants](http://www.thelocal.se/20121129/44726), when it actually turned out he'd left his backpack at a restaurant and the two immigrants were helping him get back into his wheelchair. The very same charming fellow abused guards at the riksdag as well. But he was kicked out of the party. His behaviour was 'uncivilized', unlike the guys who abuse foreign-looking people, harass women, and arm themselves with lead pipes to beat people up.

Links from thelocal, sure, but it's the only decent site on Swedish news in english.

And if you can read Swedish as welll, there's the entirety of [this article](http://expo.se/2011/sa-ljuger-sd-om-sin-historia_3612.html) to explain their racism as well. These people aren't teddybears. They're people with strong ties to nazism.

&gt;Because SD is so well known for physical assaults. They have all of, what is it now, zero attacks made on anyone?

They truly are saints.

* Valencia's regional government lost control of the regional public TV. [Link](http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/11/07/inenglish/1383840175_309890.html)

Context:

1. The regional government fired illegally 60% of the employees. 

2.  The court has said recently that the lay-offs where done illegally as expected. 
The court said that all of them keep their jobs and that should be paid for the months that weren't in the payroll. 

3. The regional government then said that is going to shutdown the regional public TV.

4. Workers rebellion, after years of being submissive with the conservative govenment some tv shows critize some political decision and ask for forgiveness for helping to hide the crimes of the regional government. *After years of getting paid by them and no saying a shit.*

5.  Regional government said something about giving an  administrative concesion to one company to replace the public tv. A company would get money from the regional government for running a regional TV mostly in Catalonian for Valencia.

6.  The  conservative members of the public TV boards stepped down and let the left wiing minority take over the TV and use the TV to fight the government openly.

7. Government has approved an emergency decree to take over again the public TV soon.

Der Satz müsste vollständig lauten: »Es ist halt einfach Satire, und man sollte sie deswegen nicht so ernst nehmen.«  Mir scheint, dass Du eine krude Vorstellung davon hast, was gute Satire ausmacht.  Eine Satire, die nicht zumindest ihrer Stoßrichtung nach auf Aufklärung und Läuterung abzielt, ist im besten Falle seicht (wie Kishon), kippt im schlimmsten, wie im vorliegenden um in affirmatorische, boshafte Häme auf Kosten eines Unschuldigen.  Um gut zu sein, braucht eine Satire etwas Todernstes, gegen dessen *Verursacher* sich der Spott richten kann.  Gut wäre Sonneborns Satire gewesen, wenn er statt des Bankers einen  TV-Journalisten des ZDF bei solchen unredlichen Praktiken gefilmt, und danach mit versteckter Kamera Gespräche mit dessen Vorgesetzten geführt und sie durch vorgespieltes Einverständnis zur Rechtfertigung dieser Praxis bekommen hätte – aber das würde niemals gesendet, weil es Konsequenzen hätte.  Nicht dass der Banker ein solches vorgefertigtes Interview inszenieren wollte, ist der Skandal, *sondern seine Erwartung, damit durchzukommen*.  Warum hat er diese Erwartung?  Weil er es wahrscheinlich schon öfter so gemacht hat; weil die Journalisten sich allzu oft zu Komplizen machen; weil das System so funktioniert.  Aber diesen Eindruck darf man im Öffentlich-Rechtlichen ja unter keinen Umständen erwecken, damit das Publikum nicht Verdacht schöpft, für wie dumm es verkauft wird.

You certainly come across that way every time you open your mouth.

&gt;These weren't just nobodies. There were the economics and justice spokespeople. 

Correct, nor did I say otherwise. Hence why it's more to the party's credit that they were dealt with.

&gt;but it's actually a systemic infection of the entire joke of a political party. 

Kindly prove it. I expect you would be very upset if I made similar claims of Australian politics and immigration.

&gt;There's a reason every other party in parliament outright refuses to associate with them to the point that the opposition votes in favour of government bills to make sure that SD hasn't had a controlling say

Again with blatant ignorance. The left and right regularly votes with SD on many issues. The far left votes with them on issues of animal rights and preventing more tax cuts for non-workers for instance. The Moderates vote with them on many issues. In fact the only issue where they don't get support in is their immigration and integration views.

&gt;The leaders of SDs youth wing wrote in support of the two, saying they shouldnt have caved into media pressure and removed them.

The leader of SD's youth wing is actually known for his conflicts with the main party and the numerous attempts they've made to get rid of him, which they haven't been able to since he hasn't said anything racist. They finally decided to simply get rid of the youth party's representative post just a week ago.

&gt;Regardless, these fucking thugs weren't even expelled from the party, they were just removed from prominent posts. 

Almqvist got expelled from the party and now lives in Hungary.

Ekeroth, the guy filming, got removed from all his posts and had to take a long break from politics. 

&gt;they only push people out of the party for 'alcoholism' such as with William Petzäll. 

&gt;Of course, I heard the real reason from one of my right leaning Swedish friends was because he was for the decriminalization of drugs, but whatever.

Petzäll got pushed out because he relapsed into benzodiazepine addiction and refused to step down to go to rehab. That's never even been a question so that you don't know it says a lot. He died overdosing some time later.

&gt;What I think I know? Well, there's this other MP from the SD who refers to darker skinned people as monkeys.

Point out which. That would be an immediate expulsion for pretty much anyone and has been for local politicians.

&gt;Then there's the charming story of the SD MP who claimed to have been robbed and mugged by immigrants, when it actually turned out he'd left his backpack at a restaurant and the two immigrants were helping him get back into his wheelchair. The very same charming fellow abused guards at the riksdag as well.

The wheelchair drunk? Yeah, he's expelled since long ago. He was already under investigation before that because of similarly vile statements. 

&gt;The difference is, I lived in Sweden for a little over two years, learnt the language quite well, and had a Swedish girlfriend. 

Yet it's pretty clear you don't know a thing about it more than foreigners who read the Local. Funny that.

&gt;I actually know what the fuck I'm talking about when it comes to Swedish, unlike your little racist Norwegian friend who knew butt-fuck all about Australia.

This is scary for a few reasons . . steadily across Syria the Rebels are getting crushed on all Fronts. In the last week alone SAA has gained the major Strategic Rebel Strong-hold of Al-Safira in Aleppo and now this morning Breaking News from Syria was that the SAA have initiated their Surprise Aleppo offensive which has been predicted to happen for almost a year now.

They have taken Base 80 http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/08/us-syria-crisis-aleppo-idUSBRE9A70JN20131108 and many experts are looking at this offensive as the definitive battle in the War so far. The SAA plan many believe is to split Aleppo into two which will decimate Rebel supply Lines and make Aleppo placed Rebels very weak during the coming harsh winter.
If Aleppo is lost to the SAA, the War is all but officially over, possibly before 2015.

What I see happening now in videos like this and others is that the Rebels from the most extreme factions are placing the blame for losing on ""The West"" This includes primarily USA, France and UK with other countries as targets also, but those are the main 3. They see the in-action of ""The West"" to kill Assad as actually supporting the SAA.

This is VERY bad news since if/when the War does End .. there will be tens of thousands of very pissed off and radicalized ""Jihadists"" seeking vengeance on UK/France since they will be easy targets as many of these Jihadists already have passports for there.

You should get the Bahncard 50 if you are mostly travelling spontaneously, i.e. you know weeks in advance when you will travel, not months in advance. Booking merely weeks in advance makes it usually impossible to get one of the limited number of tickets with a reduced fare.

Conversely you should get the Bahncard 25 if you will often be able to get one of the tickets with a reduced fare.

Also, the French just seem to greatly dislike the Jews at this point in time, they've banned Yarmulkes and Kippahs in public and there's a huge amount of discrimination against Jews there. Sweden accepts a huge number of refugees and immigrants that dislike Jews; that growing presence appears to be a rising source of resent for Jews and is causing many to want to leave for other places like Germany, Israel, and even Poland.

When shown that there is probably less nazi presence in France, then you go on to claim that it's ""because the French are less friendly to jews"". 
You seem to base this opinion on the fact that they banned Yarmulkes and Kippahs.
Which as far as I know went the same **for every religious symbol in public schools and gov. offices.**

I'm not a Jew. Doesn't mean I'm not a member of a minority. I understand that being a Jew gets you hate-points and there are people who define themselves with hating those that are different. And I get it that Jews are probably on top of that list. You also probably have over-sensitive view of what counts as persecution - and with good justification. 

But being over-sensitive is a problem, no matter how justified it is. There is always a background radiation, if you will, of idiots and boors. We must do everything we can as a community to combat them (and I thought that all the links you gave showed majority doing just that!) but we can't ever say that such background radiation is near the top of charts. If you say that drawing swastikas on gravestones is ""(relatively) large"" thing, what comes next? Unopposed marches, perhaps, in my thinking. But what comes after? Gargantuan, Monstrous, Infinite? Because those are the sort of terms we should then use of the situation in Greece. As we would go forward, we exhaust the dictionary long before we get to anywhere close to Nazi-Germany. 


You then claimed that banning religious clothes in government buildings was something that proved that government had something against Jews - instead of this being part of the well-established French ideology of separating state and religion, and that the same restrictions applied to ALL religions. This ideology being put in the place just so that no one religion can ever repress the others. 

In other words, because you weren't treated like special snowflakes, it was anti-semitism. This, btw, is one of the most often brought point against Jews and Israel. You could have avoided this. Saying something like ""French ban on religious clothing hits everybody, but it discriminates those that derivate from norm. We have examples where Christian clothing is seen as standard, not religious, while the same isn't held true for clothing from other cultures"". I would have bought that. Instead you skip that and start shouting wolf. 

And we all know how that story ends.

&gt; and we may like a place one moment and then dislike it the next

This is human, and I understand it. We are always unsatisfied about something; that's part of how we try to change the world more suitable for us. But talking about griefs inside the community where you can frame your talk as ""it would be better for us (the minority) if things were like this"", in public, you must talk in ""it would be better for us (as part of majority) if things would change thus because.."". Can you see the distinction? Changes in society must be benefital and must be the same for everybody. If kippas would be allowed but scarves would have been disallowed, that would have been just plain racism. You must argue for the change of norm to include cultural clothing or to exclude christian clothing - you did neither.

&gt;Personally, I don't like Israel very much, but I do have a very strictly aligned opinion with the rest of my Jewish community and I don't find that it can really be questioned by stating that there was more crime in 2012 in one place or the other or cherry-picking news sources that talk about German antisemitism.

I'm not sure if I read you correctly, but if this is something like you must follow the official line of Israel out of principle, you aren't helping anybody, least of all yourself. There are a lot of people (me included) who don't really care about religions other than as glorified hobbies, but who are politically aware. I make the distinction between Judaism-the-religion and Israel-the-country. 

If you don't, you make yourself open for political critique. In an over-sensitive mindset this might be seen as anti-semitism (and indeed, Israeli spokepeople have often done so). Saying such conclusions aloud from Jewish community (as opposed from paid officials) you help people to see Judaism and Israel as the same thing. 

If this is so, then it's just as ok to throw thrash at people who identify as Jews as it's right to throw thrash at people who identify as Nazis (but haven't been proven to have done anything).

If you can get a cheap ticket (for that you have to plan in advance and know when you will travel about one month in advance) the same will cost you €29. Whether by train or car, getting there will take a little less than six hours (if the last stretch wouldn’t have to be bridged by a regional train the train would be faster).

For up to two people the train would consequently definitely be cheaper, not even including the price and upkeep of the car.

Even if one cannot get one of the cheaper tickets the cost is about the same (€68.50) for one person with a Bahncard 50 (€249, not much compared to the costs of owning a car). Then advance planning is not necessary and flexibility is great (a normal ticket is valid for 48 hours and it is possible to take alternate trains and make stops in-between). The ticket includes public transport in many large cities (including Hamburg) so getting to the train station is also free. Trains are fast, generally punctual, have power outlets (but are in dire need of better WiFi) and are comfortable and much more spacious than cars.

Of course there are scenarios where the car is cheaper and wins out but blanket statements such as yours just make no sense at all. Depending on the person and their situation either cars or trains can make more sense.

My car needs around 6l at a price of €1.32/l (diesel) - so I need 60l * €1.32 = 79.2€ per trip.

I almost never travel alone, so let's say that's my total cost for a round trip, because I take a friend with me and we split the cost so each has to pay around 80€.

Now when I look at the price list from the link of this post I see the cheapest tickets for two persons is 250 Euros for a return ticket, that's 125 Eur per person. According to google maps the car ride would take roughly nine hours (we know it's longer because of breaks and traffic) while the cheapest train ride takes 13:15 hours and even 15:17 back. So this means I spend around 30% more time in the train than I would in the car while paying 56% more. (Even when we're assuming your 7l car with a price of 1.55€ it's still cheaper).

I know this is an exceptional case because in Südbaden there are only slow shitty trains, but your main point was also kind of exceptional because not everyone lives in big cities and wants to ride to another big city.

And yes, maybe it's cheaper by train when you book early, but my point was also flexibility - and planning (a) week(s) in advance is not flexible for me. Also, for me driving is the more comfortable solution, but that is just my opinion.

Say the Tories (UK's more right wing party) get 40% of the seats in Parliament, Labour (the UK's more left wing party) gets 40% of the seats and the Liberal Democrats (the UK's resident kind-of-in-the-middle party) get 20%. Non of the parties can form a government on their own, and Labour and the Tories are too different to form a coalition but the Liberals are centrist enough to be able to form a government with either party. This allows them to choose who they give their support to and effectively decide who the government is. But they have absolutely no chance of being able to govern alone. And if the parties are unable to come to a coalition agreement like the Lib Dems and Tories did in 2010, then one of the big two parties might have to form a minority government and govern without a majority of the seats.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; a) the monetary sum is based on the value of 100(?) camels.

In western countries the possible compensations to the victim or victim's family can vary between countries and cases from nothing to millions and seem quite arbitrary anyway. So however hard I try I just cannot get riled up about the market value of camels here as to me it seems just as arbritrary as many other instances. But as apparently in German justice system the victim or victim's family is not entitled to compensation I can understand that such may feel a strange concept.

&gt; b) in modern society there is no compensation that the victim could claim, just like there is no revenge or vigilantism. The legal system decides as a non biased instance. It might sentence the accused to pay a fine or to go to prison etc., but the important part is that the ""victim"" plays no part the process.

TIL I don't live in a modern society. When I was randomly mugged I was indeed entitled to financial compensation by the culprit, it was me (rather arbitrarily) proposing the adequate compensation, and in the case I was very much part of the process.

&gt; Humanity suffered through literally thousands of years under those conditions, until we reached the break trough of a neutral judicial system. It's vital to acknowledge the effort it took to accomplish this, in order to realize the importance of our current system and the values behind it.

Well based on your description I for one do NOT want your current system.

I think the whole 100-camels-ZOMG-rhetoric misses the important point here. The driver was not the culprit in the first place, and it apparently was the boy who ran against the red light.

The main point being, ""If you're rude, you wont be treated well"". 
US and French rudeness differs a bit.

For example, being loud, especially in a restaurant, is very rude. A simple rule, people at tables near to yours should not be able to ear your conversation.

As for crime, touristic places are safe, but be careful of pickpockets. Don't put your wallet in your back pocket. Same rule apply for the parisian subway.

As for tourists scam, it's mostly restaurants near very touristic places like Montmartre. Never go in a restaurant that look typical. If the waiters wear berets, it's a scam.

Also you should learn at least enough French to explain that you don't speak French and basic greetings.

Der Staat Israel ist erheblicher Kritik ausgesetzt, diese Kritik wendet sich natürlich nicht unbedingt gegen den Zionismus. Auch heißt Kritik gegen den Zionismus nicht ausschließlich, dass man die Juden aus Palästiner wieder vertreiben will, wie einige arabische Gruppierungen es etwa fordern. 

Meiner Meinung gibt es im Israelischen Staat chauvinistische Ansätze, wie etwa, dass nicht Juden Bürger zweiter Klasse sind. Auch gibt es immer wieder Probleme von intitiunellen Rassismus wie sich bei der Abweisung und zwangssterilisation von schwarzen Juden in letzter Zeit gezeigt hat.

My very bad translation of lyrics

Take Back the Corsica - Skiantos

* Much part was Italian
* we have some right
* Come on let's do it really
* a gratuitous but proud action
* playing on the relaxed spirit of the holidays
* taking advantage of the relaxed spirit of the holidays
* (it) will be a legendary operation
* for the surprise they will no longer defend
* if we lose we will ask forgiveness
* coming out with the next amnesty !

X4 Take Back the Corsica !

* Outside the padded room
* will be more beautiful life
* we need just a bit of courage
* to hitch a ride
* or maybe a free ticket
* to board the ferry

X4 Take Back the Corsica !

* maybe they do not expect
* maybe they do not care
* (we will) attack from the ports
* (we) will establish new courses
* but if you do not want to have problem
* Keep Your Mouth Shut

X4 Take Back the Corsica !

No, shitty argument, without money we would take whatever else the buyer has, let's say olive oil, and trade it with others for something we really want. Now because the buyer hasn't yet produced as much olive oil as he would need he gives us a piece of paper promising the rest later. And because we say yes to that we even get a bit more to make up for the delay. And because we don't want to wait for the olive oil we trade the piece of paper with someone else and now he ownes this debt. And it would work fine if someone didn't forget to actually harvest the fucking olives ...

No the real problem isn't us producing, the real problem is them not producing enough of worth but still trading stuff for promises they could never meet later on.

true,mucco,trentino,,"First of all, congratulations on going to one of the best cities for living in Italy. Turin is wildly regarded as bustling and active while not being as expensive and stressful as Milan, or ""italian"" in the bad meaning of the word as Rome. In my (biased) opinion, it is the perfect mix of relaxed Italian and industrious European way of life. Living here is a blessing.

English is mostly fine for getting things done. Expect not to be able to communicate with people over 40. Do *not* try to impose your language or act as people should know it, even if it is an ""important"" place like a police department. Try to learn ""grocery basics"". Otherwise, you can make friends while asking for an impromptu translator - speaking for myself here, but I enjoy foreigners trying to interact with the residents. I think most people do, too.

5+ years in Turin here, I don't have a car. Turin has very cheap public bike service and an excellent (so far... damn budget cuts) public transportation network. You can even buy furniture as the local IKEA store has a shuttle from the subway station and will bring your purchases to your home for a fee. That said, a car is always useful. If you have never been to Europe or Italy in particular, you should consider practicing your driving skills before using it to commute - car commuters in Italy are extremely skilled, extremely aggressive, and expect everyone else to be just as good as them. This means they will routinely drive at 50 mph in city streets during peak times (the speed limit is 30), fill all the lanes fully, keep distances between cars shorter than 4-5 meters, and generally know street lights so they start just as the green light comes off (if not a couple seconds earlier) - and they will honk and insult you if you delay them. I've seen how Americans drive, and I imagine Turin commuting must be hell for an unprepared yank. :p

Oh, and there are no free parking spots, ever. If you drive to work you should be fine, but on the way back you might wander around for 20-30 minutes before you find a spot, if you're unlucky. Forget about grocery stores with huge empty parkplaces, you want to walk to the store here.

Other things to expect: Turin is one of the Italian cities with the most, and biggest, housing buildings. It is absolutely normal to have a flat at the 5th or 6th floor here. Population density is super high. Expect *a lot* of people everywhere, a lot of body contact, a lot of interaction. A lot of discussions about calcio (soccer). Expect streets to be dirty, and smelly at times, but you will find that everyone is very clean, and you should strive to be like that too. Never talk about bidets if it isn't to say that you converted and are now using them regularly. Also, you will find much fewer of those deranged homeless loud people that will get angry at you for no reason (I saw quite a bit of those in the USA). People behave a lot more homogeneously here.

Avoid living north of the Dora river, as a rough indication. Districts in that part of the city can be sketchy and not too safe at times - for Europe, anyway. Still super safe for USA standards as nobody here carries guns - robbers usually employ knives and they are quite rare. Train your eyes to spot scammers though, if people smell that you're a foreigner some of them will definitely try to scam or otherwise trick you.

Expect the institutions to not be helpful to you. Italy as a state is very malfunctioning. When you will have to deal with our bureaucracy you will get mad. Digitalization of the various services has started but it still has a long way to go, and long queues are the norm at offices. The authorities are generally unpleasant and might display some half-concealed racism if you are not caucasian - an English friend of mine, who is black, got stopped by the police and questioned not once but twice because they just assumed he was an illegal immigrant. Many people in general will be less than pleasant with you while doing their job: get used to it quick. We have no money to afford paying people to smile here.

I also reckon that you will get weird looks and possibly be treated ""like a foreigner"" if you are very overweight or very built - those two body types are quite common in the USA, but in Italy they are both very rare. You find fit people, and overweight people, but neither not nearly as noticeably and frequently as over there.

Weather is hot in summer - but not Arizona hot - and cold in winter - but not Maine cold. It can rain quite a bit at times. Go skiing in winter and sunbathe in parks (or the close seaside) in summer. Do travel as much as you can - Paris is a 7 hour train ride, Rome is 4 hours away with TAV trains, and every 50 miles in Italy there is a lot to see, in any direction. Flights are extremely cheap too all over Europe - two companies, Easyjet and Ryanair, offer stupidly low prices if you book early enough. You will find Turin-London round trips below 50€, and similar fares all around with those companies.

You might not like the food, at first. Americans have very different tastes than Italians. Meat is uncommon and not as cheap, and carbs, fruit and veggies make up most of the diet for many people. Every Italian I know is also very boasty about ""Italian food"" and you might find that annoying. That said, Italian food is extremely high quality and Turin is in a great spot right now. A kind of culinary movement/brand called ""Slow Food"" has arisen in the past few years to put even more of a focus on properly cooked food with top quality, local ingredients. This movement, led by the restaurant/grocery chain emerging giant ""Eataly"", has spread from Turin to the whole nation since 2005 or so. Definitely check it out, possibly with an Italian who can advise you.",0,1384132914,null,0,false,0,cdbegc8,t3_1q7hn1,t1_cdbegc8,t3_1q7hn1,null,1428710711,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

true,Pwndbyautocorrect,EURO,European Union,"&gt; the restricting of domestic demand in Germany is having serious consequences for the rest of the Eurozone.

To stop ""restricting"" domestic demand, you need to allow for more disposable income, which is achieved by either lowering taxes (with the SPD as a coalition partner, the government will never do that), increasing welfare (which they probably won't do, as Hartz IV seems to be working well enough and is designed to reduce the amount of long-term unemployed) or setting/raising the minimum wage (which is likely to happen or at least be debated). It's also important to acknowledge that the average German consumer is -in my opinion- likely to save a bigger part of his disposable income than his peers in France or Italy, for example. That's like natural austerity.

The problem is that Germany is generally reluctant to do any of these as its economic figures/data and the think tanks its government hires seem to all support their current export-driven policies.

I'm ok with this

Il furry porn è la prima cosa che viene tirata fuori ogni volta che si parla di perversioni sessuali su qualunque discussione in internet. Da una persona che frequenta reddit mi aspetto che lo conosca, come mi aspetto riconosca il significato di un advice animal se lo posto o di un meme se lo cito. Statisticamente è normale trovare qualcuno che non lo conosce, ma se la tendenza si scosta troppo dalla [gaussiana](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variabile_casuale_normale) inizio a pensare a qualche fattore non aleatorio, da cui la mia supposizione per quanto riguarda questo thread. Per quanto riguarda l'anal pissing io non avevo mai sentito questo accostamento in particolare, ma leggendolo ho capito immediatamente di cosa si trattasse e continuo a pensare che anche tu l'avresti potuto facilmente supporre se ti fossi fermato a pensare un attimo su cosa potesse essere, invece di rispondere sostanzialmente con una cosa che ho letto come ""OLOLOL cosa è sta roba assurda ti prego spiegamelo xD"" 

&gt; Ma, oh pornoracolo, ne approfitto, visto che ne sai tanto, ci illumini su questa, almeno per me ancora misteriosa, primal domination?

Rispondo a questa domanda sarcastica con qualche numero:

Cerco ""furry"" su google: Circa 38.300.000 risultati

Cerco ""primal domination"" su Google: Circa 2.450 risultati.

Usando google come misura di popolarità, furry è circa 15 mila volte più popolare di primal domination. E' lecito aspettarsi che un individuo che frequenta internet abbia sentito parlare di furry, non lo è nel caso di primal domination (che non avevo appunto mai sentito prima)

""posizione""), in analogia a quanto usato in altre aggettivazioni di genere (""pecorina"", ""smorzacandela"" ....[inserisci tu qui altre esotiche posizioni e perdona la mia limitata esperienza nel settore])

credo siano usate entrambe ""posizione missionaria"" e ""[posizione del missionario](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posizioni_sessuali#Posizione_del_missionario)"", magari con qualche preferenza stilistica per la seconda.

Selbst Michael Jackson habe ich schätzen gelernt ;)

Etwa bis 1990 wurden selbst Mainstream-CDs mit erträglicher Kompression gemastert. Ansonsten gilt: Schallplatten-Releases wurden oft mit mehr Dynamik gemastert, nicht weil das Medium technisch überlegen ist, sondern - so meine Vermutung - weil die Zielgruppe anspruchsvoller war. Tipp: bei Spotify lieber die alten Original-Releases hören statt der neueren Remasters oder gar Compilations.

true,MightyMousePepTalk,UKGB,FIB - My life is a lie.,"- Great food and drink (meat and beer. My kind of heaven)

- a penchant for fantastic moustaches

- awesome football league (and national team, I somewhat begrudgingly admit.)

- Whilst on the subject of football, they won their first worldcup in 1954 after being 2-0 down to the strong favourites, Hungary (the Magical Magyars), who scored 8 goals against them in the groups. West Germany won 3-2. Some say it was because they have screw on studs (invented by Adi Dassler (Adidas)) so they could put on bigger studs to stop slipping. This match is known as the Miracle of Bern.

- Germany's rugby team is in group 1B of the European Nations Cup. Basically, they are in the second group below the 6 Nations and are in first place with two game left. They could get promoted to 1A (below the 6 nations). Then they hit the ceiling: no promotion in the 6 nations.

- Die Welt was founded by the British after WW2 because they wanted to create a national newspaper like The Times. 

- Football fact - you can tell which army occupied post WW2 by looking at the stadiums - in the North-West they are in the British style, but in the South (and the French bits) they are in the American Style.

- German is the most spoken native language in Europe

- Europa Park, in Baden-Wuertemburg, is my all time favourite theme park.

- Titisee is lovely, but it has an hilarious name.

- the Black Forest gets its name from the pine trees. They are so dense they block the sun from getting to the forest floor so it is dark.

- the Black Forest is renowned for its Gateau, but Rothaus bier has a cult status and rightly so. It's awesome.

- the Germans have a...sensitive relationship with its neighbours although things are generally much better these days.

- the German national anthem was written in Helgioland (small island, north of Hamburg) by a man in exile (self imposed?). 

- When Germany gave up its claim to Zanzibar in exchange for Helgioland, that bloke suddenly found himself in Germany again! (Queen Victoria was pissed by this deal, but the UK needed Zanizbar to protect her African interests since Tanganyka was part of German East Africa. Ninja edit: as were lots of German Imperialists. Bismarck named the deal such so that it sounded that Germany was giving a large part of imperial land for a tiny island. He did this because he negotiated the deal, but it was concluded under Leo van Caprivi. With the nomenclature it meant Caprivi took a lot of stick for the trade.)

- Edit: Since I just mentioned Bismarck above I'll add it here. Otto von Bismarck. The Iron Chancellor. The founder of the German state. A pragmatic man if ever there was one. State Capital of North Dakota is named after him.

- The words *Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles* in the anthem are suppose to represent German unity of one country rather than all the small states and principalities that existed before 1871. The meaning changed in later years.

What he was was a tool for National Socialist Propaganda, and he enjoyed being the hero Hitler and Goebbels desperately needed after the stalemates in Russia. You just have to look at him in the films where he is with Hitler. The letters between him and his wife, praising Hitler. He knew of the nature of the Regime, but he retreated to his position of ""being a soldier, not a politician"" and washed his hands in innocence. 

If he was such a great General, why was he sent to what was regarded as nothing more than a secondary theatre by German high command? Why didn't he fight were the decision over the fate of Germany was made?

He was good, no doubt, he had an excellent grasp of maneuver warfare and the importance of decisiveness and swiftness. But his persona was glorified both by the Nazi propaganda machine *and* by the allies which all made him look larger than life. 

And he had his shortcomings.

1/ Je n'accorde aucune crédibilité à ce blogueur. Il n'est absolument pas objectif. Son seul argument est les stats de l'institut  médico-legal. Et uniquement IML. EN 1961, est ce qu'on peut faire une confiance aveugle à cet institut? Qui peut l'influencer? Qui a intérêt à donner de tels chiffres? De plus ses stat s'arrête au 21 Oct, y'en combien qui sont encore dans la seine? Que gagnent les médias à annoncer 300 morts quand d'après ce blogueur il y en a eu aucun?

2/ Que fait -il des témoignages? Ceux des Nord Africains mais aussi des français? C'est pas si vieux et il y a eu beaucoup de témoignages.

3/ C'est qui ce rigolo pour donner des chiffres ""de mémoire""? Un gars de l'OAS?

&gt; Pour mémoire, de janvier 1955 au 1er juillet 1962, les tueurs du FLN assassinèrent en France métropolitaine 6000 Algériens et en blessèrent 9000.
Pour mémoire encore, le 26 mars 1962, devant la Grande Poste de la rue d’Isly à Alger, les forces de l’ordre ne firent pas preuve de la même retenue que le 17 octobre à Paris quand elles ouvrirent directement le feu sur une foule de civils français non armés, faisant entre 70 et 80 morts et 150 blessés. Sur ces victimes, réelles celles-là, la mémoire sélective a jeté le voile de l’oubli.

Franchement, la vérité comme tu dis n'est pas dans ce blog. Je m'attendais à ""c'est des terroristes"" ""la manif était interdire"" ..etc. C'est l'argument classique. Mais là...il nie en bloc...la vache!

stando a [questa](http://www.worldwidewebsize.com) fonte ci sarebbero, al momento, almeno 1.93 miliardi di pagine nel web, mentre la dimensione dell'index di Google si aggirerebbe sui 20 miliardi di pagine. 
Usando il primo dato, 38.300.000 pagine rappresentano 1.98% (Se però usiamo, come secondo me più corretto) la dimensione dell'indice invece del numero delle pagine, otteniamo lo 0.19%.

[Bill Maher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Maher) addirittura ne ottiene 193.000.000.

facendo una controprova però si scopre che

[**“Non usare gli ogm non fa bene, anzi”**](http://www.linkiesta.it/ogm)

*In Friuli i campi coltivati con mais ogm stanno “contaminando” i campi limitrofi: rischio epidemia?*

di Tommaso Canetta

Gli organismi geneticamente modificati (ogm) sono una novità vecchia di 10mila anni. Da quando, cioè, l’uomo è diventato agricoltore e ha cominciato a modificare il patrimonio genetico di piante e animali. Le nuove tecnologie, nate successivamente alla scoperta della struttura del Dna 50 anni fa, consentono interventi più incisivi, in tempi ristretti e dagli esiti maggiormente prevedibili. Tuttavia un alone di timori e preoccupazioni accompagna il tema degli ogm di “nuova generazione” ogni volta che se ne parla, l’opinione pubblica in Italia è ancora fortemente contraria e i governi tendono ad assecondare questa vulgata. L’esecutivo guidato da Enrico Letta non fa eccezione.

Lo scorso 12 luglio il governo ha varato un decreto legge, controfirmato dai ministri della Salute (Beatrice Lorenzin), dell’Agricoltura (Nunzia De Girolamo) e dell’Ambiente (Andrea Orlando), che vieta la coltivazione di una variante di mais geneticamente modificato, il Mon810 della Monsanto, per i successivi 18 mesi a meno che prima non intervengano misure comunitarie. Questo decreto si era reso necessario per impedire che le varianti transgeniche autorizzate dall’Unione europea fossero utilizzate in piena libertà anche in Italia, come stabilito l’8 maggio 2013 dalla Corte di giustizia della Ue.

In quella data i giudici europei avevano ribaltato la decisione del tribunale di Pordenone che condannava Giorgio Fidenato, un agricoltore che aveva coltivato i suoi campi in Friuli col mais Mon810, in quanto privo di autorizzazione nazionale. La Corte di giustizia della Ue ha invece ritenuto che tale autorizzazione non fosse necessaria, essendo lecito a livello europeo l’impiego del cereale ogm. Per evitare che altri seguissero il suo esempio il governo italiano ha bloccato tutto con un decreto in odore di essere contrario alla normativa europea, anche se non ha ordinato la “bonifica” dei campi, come invece alcuni chiedevano. Il Corpo Forestale è tuttavia andato a fare dei sopralluoghi.

Le analisi della Forestale rivelano che in una zona adiacente a quella seminata con semente transgenica la “contaminazione” raggiunge un picco massimo del 10% e questo dato è bastato per presentare scenari apocalittici e per riaccendere lo scontro tra favorevoli e contrari agli ogm. «Stiamo andando incontro a un vero disastro ambientale per la mancata assunzione di responsabilità nei confronti di una provocazione che, secondo il Corpo Forestale dello Stato, ha causato la contaminazione del 10% dei campi limitrofi a quelli coltivati Ogm in Friuli», ha affermato la Coldiretti, là dove la “provocazione” sarebbe ovviamente la decisione di Fidenato di impiegare il mais transgenico. Posizione diametralmente opposta per Assobiotec, che già ai tempi dell’emanazione del provvedimento governativo parlava di «presa di posizione ideologica che viola le norme Ue» e che non fa gli interessi dell’agricoltura.

Da un punto di vista della forma il decreto del governo appare sicuramente censurabile. Reiterando una disciplina già bocciata dalla Corte di giustizia il decreto si pone in contrasto con la disciplina europea in modo palese, tanto che il ministro De Girolamo, dovendo spiegare il provvedimento preso, ammise: «L’Europa lo potrebbe impugnare, è vero, e ci esponiamo a una violazione delle regole comunitarie. Però nei confronti della Francia, che ha bloccato le coltivazioni ogm con un provvedimento simile, Bruxelles non ha ancora avviato la procedura di infrazione».

La speranza sembrerebbe quella di evitare la procedura di infrazione, perché tanto siamo in buona compagnia nel violare il diritto comunitario. Peccato che in Francia le cose nel frattempo siano cambiate. Lo scorso agosto il Consiglio di stato francese ha annullato il divieto – adottato nel marzo 2012, invocando la clausola di salvaguardia - di coltivazione del mais transgenico. I giudici di Parigi hanno ritenuto che non ci fossero elementi di rischio evidente per la salute umana, animale ed ambientale che potessero giustificare l’applicazione della norma di salvaguardia da parte della Francia. La conclusione si basa sui pareri espressi dal Comitato scientifico dell’Autorità europea per la sicurezza alimentare (EFSA), dall’Alto Consiglio per le Biotecnologie, e su uno studio pubblicato nel febbraio 2012 da ricercatori dell'Istituto federale svizzero di Tecnologia di Zurigo.

Al di là della forma, l’atteggiamento dei governi italiani in materia di ogm è censurabile anche sotto il profilo dei contenuti, almeno secondo la comunità scientifica. «Spesso si trascura che quasi tutte le piante coltivate non sono più naturali da moltissimo tempo», spiega Piero Morandini, ricercatore di fisiologia vegetale ed esperto di biotecnologie agrarie. «I cereali che coltiviamo ad esempio non disperdono i semi quando sono maturi, non sopravvivono in un ambiente selvatico quando abbandonati a se stessi. Li abbiamo selezionati noi esseri umani nel corso del tempo perché fossero così. Altrimenti invece di raccogliere le spighe dovremmo prendere i chicchi da terra uno per uno. La questione ogm viene spesso posta in modo pretestuoso, la stessa espressione “ogm” è fuorviante. È dal neolitico che, selezionando mutazioni a noi favorevoli, di fatto modifichiamo i geni delle piante».

**Partiamo dal caso concreto. Sono fondate le paure di un “contagio” nei campi in Friuli dove è stato piantato il mais Mon810? Potrebbe insomma, essendo più resistente degli altri tipi di mais, espandersi in modo non controllato?**

Assolutamente no. La contaminazione è stata, nei due campi esaminati, principalmente all’interno dello stesso campo e in parte di quelli limitrofi, ma solo sui bordi confinanti. Si trattava infatti di due campi, ciascuno dei quali diviso in due parti, una destinata al cereale transgenico, l’altra a quello tradizionale. A 10 metri di distanza dalle piante transgeniche, la forestale ha rilevato una contaminazione bassa, circa del 2-4%, e solo in un caso del 10%. Basta allontanarsi di 20 metri dalle file di mais transgenico e la commistione crolla a valori ancora più bassi (alcuni intorno a 1-2%) se non a zero (tecnicamente “sotto il limite di rilevabilità”). Questi dati oltretutto sono perfettamente in linea con quanto si sa sul mais e sulla diffusione del suo polline. Un campo limitrofo con una contaminazione su un bordo del 5% e zero in tutto il resto può essere tranquillamente raccolto e venduto senza timori perché la contaminazione è molto sotto del limite di legge dello 0,9 per cento. Ricordiamo che il mais Mon810 può ancora continuare a essere importato e consumato in Italia!

**Le paure nei confronti degli ogm sembrano poggiare talvolta sul principio per cui ad ogni azione corrisponde una reazione. Se introduciamo organismi geneticamente modificati per essere più resistenti non rischiamo di compromettere l’equilibrio dell’ecosistema?**

Ovvio che delle conseguenze ci sono ma è da sempre che l’uomo contrasta il selvatico. Ad esempio, come sarebbe la Toscana oggi senza l’agricoltura? E l’agricoltura è per sua natura un’attività che compromette gravemente la biodiversità: in un campo selvatico dove esistono centinaia di specie si fa in modo che ne cresca solo una, la coltura: grano, riso o altro. Solo un pesantissimo intervento sulla natura rende possibile che in Italia vivano 60 milioni.

true,strozzapreti,null,null,"**Ma nell’ambito delle conseguenze che sono ad oggi prevedibili, esistono motivi di preoccupazione?**

No, anzi. Allo stato attuale è prevedibile che è dannoso non usare gli ogm, anche se il beneficio o il rischio va giudicato caso per caso. Ad esempio nel caso del mais Mon810, questo consente una riduzione dell’uso degli insetticidi e del danno da insetti, e quindi comporta una minore infestazione di funghi (alcuni dei quali producono tossine dannose per l’uomo e gli animali) sulle pannocchie ferite dagli insetti. In questo caso i benefici sono un cibo più sano e in maggiori quantità. Invito tutti ad andare a vedere come si presentano le pannocchie di mais convenzionale nei campi poco prima della raccolta.

**L’Italia ha uno straordinario patrimonio di ricchezza alimentare e di specialità della terra. Non c’è il rischio che utilizzando gli ogm si mettano a rischio i nostri prodotti di qualità?**

Non ne vedo il motivo. Noi importiamo ogni anno quattro milioni di tonnellate di soia transgenica, principalmente da Brasile e Argentina, e la utilizziamo come mangime per il bestiame. Non mi sembra che ad ora la qualità del Parmigiano Reggiano o del nostro prosciutto crudo ne abbiano risentito. Se invece di importare questa soia la coltivassimo, non riesco ad immaginare (e non c’è traccia nella letteratura scientifica) come questo possa essere dannoso per i nostri prodotti tipici. Inoltre ci stiamo avvicinando all’Expo sul tema “sfamare il mondo”: sarebbe insensato propagandare il rifiuto di una tecnologia che non ha pericoli intrinseci e di cui comunque usiamo i prodotti in modo massiccio.

**Ma allora come mai gli ogm incontrano questa opposizione così dura?**


Ci sono una molteplicità di ragioni. Un po’ è colpa della comunità scientifica che non è stata in grado di spiegare bene la questione. L’opera di divulgazione è stata carente.

**La comunità scientifica è compatta nella sua valutazione positiva sugli ogm?**

Ci sono pochi casi isolati contrari, ma la grande maggioranza è favorevole. Ad esempio la società di Genetica Agraria presenta un paio di individui contrari (spesso per motivazioni che hanno poco di scientifico) su un totale di oltre 300 addetti ai lavori. Ma, al di là delle responsabilità della comunità scientifica, contro gli ogm militano diversi interessi contrari. Chi produce alcuni pesticidi, ad esempio, verrebbe danneggiato dalla loro diffusione. C’è anche chi specula sulla questione per ottenere visibilità politica. Il risultato è che troppo spesso la gente forma la propria opinione senza conoscere i termini scientifici della questione. Secondo i sondaggi di Eurobarometro, oltre un terzo della gente è convinta che i pomodori normali non contengano geni, mentre quelli transgenici sì. Con queste premesse…

In the end we received many times that number. Bulgaria and Romania are much poorer than Poland and if they see the opportunity to come here to the UK and earn much more money than they would at home, then they will take it, and fair enough from their point of view. For us as a country though, we cannot sustain this and as such it is important that we get out of the EU as soon as possible and take control of our borders again, for our own sake.

Pour être plus clair; le ""wage slavery"" ne réfère pas à tous l'emploi mais aux abus massifs et systématiques qui se produisent quand l'employeur à l'avantage et tous les pouvoirs sur le salarié. Le code du travail à été inventé pour ""tracer des lignes"" et limiter ce déséquilibre; en limitant le pouvoir de l'employeur. Le ""minimum légal"" représente donc le minimum pour lequel l'employé est compensé pour son travail; et n'est donc pas exploité.

I.E; si tu encule le code du travail; tu encule le salairé avec; et il ne s'agit pas de travail à proprement parler (vu que les conditions qui définissent justement ce qu'est du travail ne sont pas appliquées/respectées); mais d'exploitation pure et simple. Le terme de ""wage slavery""; s'il n'est pas facile à traduire; me parait donc parfaitement adapté au cas présent. C'est à dire forcer quelqu'un à accepter une tache sans compensation dans des conditions impensables pour pouvoir manger à sa faim et survivre.

Ce qui m'énerve est qu'on en est dans une société ou *respecter les loi à ton égard peut-être, un jour* deviens un ""argument"" pour forcer les gens à accepter de se faire exploiter. C'est ca qui me met hors de moi; c'est pas mieux que les trafiquant humains qui font venir des gens d'afrique pour les forcer à bosser pour 20 cts de l'heure. Oh wait, c'est exactement la même chose sauf qu'ils ont en plus même pas à faire venir les gens.

Le code du travail est sensé représenter *le strict , strict, strict minimum légal*. Le truc sensé se produire dans 1% des cas et le plancher à ne pas creuser en dessous. The fuckin bedrock. Un ""salaire"" est sensé être 10x plus. Ou est l'époque ou les gens gagnaient 100K/ans ? Mais nan, maintenant ignorer le salaire est devenu la nouvelle norme.

Is this real life?

Ce ""blogueur"" comme tu dis n'est autre que Bernard Lugan, africaniste reconnu, fournissant régulièrement un travail très sérieux sur tout ce qui touche à l'Afrique. Que cela soit dans ses livres, sa revue ou sur son blog. Il commente de manière plus que pertinente l'actualité africaine et est l'auteur d'une Histoire de l'Afrique complète et sérieuse.

Donc si on veut comparer le sérieux de ""blogueurs"", M. Lugan est autrement plus recommandable sur le sujet que l'auteur de l'article posté par OP.

On peut douter de la fiabilité relative des archives de l'IML. Mais il y a quand même une différence importante entre 300 et 7 morts.

300 cadavres dans la Seine, ça fait beaucoup. Où sont-ils? Où-sont les images?

(Attention à la différence entre ""de mémoire"" et ""pour mémoire"", 5/20 en compréhension de texte, pas plus)

&gt; Que gagnent les médias à annoncer 300 morts?

C'est une blague? La repentance permanente et le discrédit d'un pays ou d'un régime sont les moteurs des exagérations. Tout comme on nous présente toujours une version partisane des émeutes de Sétif et de la torture pendant la guerre d'Algérie.

Je ne cherche pas à réhabiliter les forces de l'ordre de cette époque, les exactions commises envers les deux camps par ces dernières ne sont pas particulièrement justifiables. Mais j'ai un gros problème avec l'exagération partisane unilatérale qui pousse toujours plus les français à la repentance. Et surtout un gros problème avec l'Histoire élevée au rang de dogme intouchable. Le révisionnisme historique existe dans tous les domaines chargés (notamment le conflit Anglo-Irlandais) pourquoi est-il refusé catégoriquement dans certains cas? Je ne prétend pas que l'analyse de Bernard Lugan est la vérité absolue, pas plus que ne l'est la version ""officielle"". Mais pourquoi refuser catégoriquement d'entendre des critiques étayées venant d'un spécialiste?

Greetings serfs of inferior democratic systems ;)


More seriously. We have a mix of obligatory (change of constitution,..) and non-obligatory referendums (change of laws, to simplify).
Once a new law passes, people can announce a referendum and then they get a few months to get 50'000 signatures to force the votation. 


We also have initiative right which allows the people to force a new constitutional amendment. This requires 100'000 signatures to get the votation going. 


In my opinion it's a tremendously successful system. Obviously it's not perfect and there are a handful of results you can point out to accordingly but in comparison I think the system served us way better than competing democratic systems have served their countries. 
Swiss people are ferociously protective of their direct democracy. I can't back this up with real statistics but I'm willing to bet that a big part of the Swiss people's opposition to joining the EU is bound with the partial loss of their direct democracy.

The main effect of this system is that the real political leadership in Switzerland comes from the people and not from the politicians. Our politicians are accordingly mainly boring administrative types and not the inspirational leader types you see in other countries.

The biggest failing of our current system is that the amount of signatures necessary is fix. Those 50'000/100'000 barriers have been set more or less 150 years ago and in the meantime the swiss population has exploded, lowering the barrier to both instruments significantly. This brings us to the current state where it is, imho, way too easy to force a votation.

* C'è pericolo che facendo sogni lucidi venga meno la funzione ristoratrice del sonno?

Sì e no. Svegliarti da un sogno lucido di solito ti fa svegliare energetico, perché genericamente ci si sveglia dopo un ciclo REM e non a casaccio come con la sveglia. Però se tenti tutte le notti come un disperato di avere sogni lucidi è possibile che un po' di sonno lo perdi.

* Quanto è figo in realtà, da uno a dieci? 

Se lo sai controllare, quindicimila. Già volare è un'esperienza strabiliante, poi interagire con gli elementi del sogno o osservare colori e cambiamenti dell'ambiente circostante è una delle cose più fighe che abbia mai fatto.

* Sei mai stata imperatrice dell'universo in sogno?

No, ma una volta ho tirato fuori delle coordinate astronomiche e ho chiesto al mio cellulare (le coordinate erano in un'app, lo so è poco fantasioso) e mi sono trovata su un pianeta lavico i cui abitanti erano dei divani con gli occhi.

&gt;Ce ""blogueur"" comme tu dis n'est autre que Bernard Lugan, africaniste reconnu,....

Ok. Au temps pour moi. Je ne le connais pas. 

[Voilà ce que dit wikipedia](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Lugan)

*Contributeur régulier de plusieurs titres réputés proches de la droite ou de l'extrême droite dans les années 1980*

Tiens..tiens..

Il semble aussi très controversé, notamment par beaucoup de ses pairs, sur divers sujets.

&gt;On peut douter de la fiabilité relative des archives de l'IML. Mais il y a quand même une différence importante entre 300 et 7 morts.

&gt;300 cadavres dans la Seine, ça fait beaucoup. Où sont-ils? Où-sont les images?

Il n'y a que lui qui avance le chiffre de 7 morts. Et il se base uniquement sur IML. Les historiens plus stricts/minimaliste donnent le chiffre de 50 personnes. Cette histoire a fait couler beaucoup d'encre durant le proces de Papon. Je veux bien qu'il révise mais nier en bloc... c'est gros! 
Si tu veux des docs, des images, etc je t'invite à te pencher sur [la bibliographie de cet article]( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_du_17_octobre_1961) à temps perdu.

&gt;(Attention à la différence entre ""de mémoire"" et ""pour mémoire"", 5/20 en compréhension de texte, pas plus)

(Merci pour ta remarque. C'est une erreur de lecture rapide. Attention à la sévérité démesurée de la note voire de la moquerie qu'elle pourrait laisser entendre)

&gt;&gt; Que gagnent les médias à annoncer 300 morts?

&gt;C'est une blague? La repentance permanente et le discrédit d'un pays ou d'un régime sont les moteurs des exagérations. Tout comme on nous présente toujours une version partisane des émeutes de Sétif et de la torture pendant la guerre d'Algérie.

C'était une question sérieuse je t'assure. Je suis naïve mais que gagne un journaliste français dans une repentance ou le discrédit de son propre pays?

Vous niez les émeutes de Sétif ? ( celles de 1945?) la torture durant la guerre d'Algérie? Trouvez vous qu'elles ont été exagérées? Des historiens sérieux ont travaillé dessus.

As krizio has said, English is only used at big companies and international projects, but they prefer Spanish or 'European' people for this positions. 

If you say that Spain is not racist country you aren't right, because in a typical company the Spaniards are going to be employed before a foreigner and this is a fact; foreigners aren't in the same conditions to be employed and this is racism.
Specially it is hard if you are Muslim here in Spain which is a very Christian society and other religions aren't seen welcome.

Some dialects of Faroese have Ónsdagur, though, which shares etymology with Wednesday. Danish, Norwegian, Swedish Onsdag, (""Ons-dag"" = Odens/Odins dag/day). In Welsh it is Dydd Mercher, meaning Mercury's Day.

In Japanese, the word Wednesday is 水曜日(sui youbi), meaning 'water day' and is associated with 水星 (suisei): Mercury (the planet), literally meaning ""water star"". Similarly, in Korean the word Wednesday is 수요일 (su yo il), also meaning water day.

* ""contaminazione del 10%"" Il mais è eterogama. Quindi si interincrocia a volontà. Ma il mais che vedi coltivato in campo è usato solo per il consumo, non per la propagazione, quindi il tutto finisce lì. Le sementi vengono prodotte da linee pure (come le razze dei cani) che vengono coltivate lontane da qualsiasi altra pianta dello stesso tipo, sia essa gmo o normale. In più, il polline non è ""progettato"" per volare a grandi distanze, qualche decina di metri è il limite massimo.

* ""tossina pericolosa per i parassiti ma potenzialmente pericolosa anche per altri organismi"" Risulta tossica solo per insetti (agisce sul sistema digerente). Inoltre la stessa tossina viene usata nelle coltivazioni biologiche perchè è, appunto, non di sintesi. Ma siccome viene lavata via, ne usano una quantità molto maggiore.

* ""Sviluppo parassiti secondari"" ovvio, la natura va avanti. Si parla di ""corsa alle armi biologiche""

* ""Pericolo per lepidotteri"" certo, qualsiasi insetto mangi quel mais muore. Ma non è la stessa cosa coi pesticidi normali? Che anzi si disperdono poi nel suolo e richiedono più appplicazioni? Ah, i lepidotteri sono le farfalle. Qui ovviamente si parla dei bruchi, le farfalle se ne fregano del polline del mais, come pure le api.


* Il mais Mon810 è approvato dalla comunità europea (uno dei pochissimi ogm). In Italia quindi si potrebbe coltivare, ma fanno un giochetto: Devi richiedere l'autorizzazione alla regione, che deve (e sottolineo deve) trovare un luogo adatto alla coltivazione appunto per limitare l'interincrocio.

- War guilt defines German culture to a certain extent, and it shouldn't.

- There is an unspoken social code in Germany far stronger than any I have encountered in any other country. It puts British politeness to shame but often limits spontaneous interaction with strangers.

- Social change in Germany comes very very slowly. I think this is largely to do with Germans having a very strong sense of self-reliance. If you make a mistake it is your fault, no argument, or sympathy.

- Germany has a largely cash based society (which is frustrating).

- Customer service is worse in Germany than in any other country I have lived / visited. This includes the likes of restaurants, banks, and telecoms companies.

- No one really plays sport in Germany (except football). Germans however, do spend a lot of time outside, walking / skiing around.

- German is a very cool language to speak, but very hard to learn. 

- German beer is high quality, but boring. Belgium wins hands down and British beer is far more interesting (stout, porter, ales, IPA).

MILD- sta per Mnemonic Induced Lucid Dream. Consiste nel ripetersi prima di dormire delle frasi che inducano il sogno lucido (i.e. stanotte faro un sogno lucido, o sto per avere un sogno lucido, whatever floats your boat). 

WILD- sta per Wake Induced Lucid Dream. E' una tecnica che prende un po' di tempo ma ha risultati quasi assicurati. Consiste nello svegliarsi a 3/4 del sonno circa e rimanere immobili cercando di far credere al corpo di essere addormentati. Quando il corpo pensa di essere addormentato comincia a mandare degli stimoli per assicurarsi di essere davvero addormentato che devi ignorare (per esempio dei pruriti o dei micromovimenti involontari). Dopo poco vedrai formarsi davanti a te luci e colori e subito dopo degli immaginari onirici. Se si aspetta con calma senza farsi spaventare del fatto che ora il nostro corpo non si può muovere ti troverai nel bel mezzo del sogno con il tuo ""corpo onirico"" a disposizione, senza più sentire il tuo.

FILD- Finger Induced Lucid Dream. Come ho detto prima sono un po' scettica su questa tecnica, consiste nello svegliarsi durante la notte e muovere impercettibilmente uno o più dita per cercare di tenere l'attenzione alta ed entrare nel sogno lucido un po' come nella WILD.

Most of his family perished in the Holocaust but he did a medical degree in London despite not speaking a word of English when he first arrived, and as soon as he could, he signed up for the British Army as an engineer (previously qualified as such). When they asked him if he wanted to join a Polish regiment, he said no, stick me in the regular army or my English will never improve, so they did. The day he was demobbed in 1945, he swore an oath to the King right then and there, Anglicised his name on his citizenship certificate and lived as an Englishman for most of his life.

* The HRE was involved in many land wars in Europe.
* The printing press, Reformation, and 30 Years War.
* The direct-ness of some parts of German culture was made by the 30 Years War. You can really feel it in books like Simplicius Simplicissimus.
* Bismarck had Germany in a good diplomatic situation, making sure that it would never go to war with more than one country at a time. But when he was no longer followed, everything went to hell and WW1 happened.
* Adolf Hitler knew that there wasn't much of a history of modern Germany to unite people around, so instead, he used the Nazi party and its symbols as a new thing that people could support that represented strength, and used hatred of minorities (especially the Jews) as a rallying force. I see very similar things happening in some segments of the American population - appealing to an ""America"" that never actually existed, being unified in hatred of things that are perceived as corrupting and weak, always wantng to appear strong to other people even of it means being hated.
* After WW2, West Germany had a big rebound as the prime European industrial power. It was able to develop an identity that had little continuity with the previous Reichs - causing a shift to Bavarian stereotypes rather than Prussian ones. East Germany, on the other hand, ended up very differently.
* The old video game Darklands is based heavily on medieval Germany.
* All Quiet on the Western Front
* Simplicius Simplicissimus

And what I know about Germany today:

* Company unions that always try to preserve jobs and retain them within the country, while at the same time, adopting new technology when needed. This is one of the foundations of modern Germany's economic success.
* Very active Groovy programming community compared to other parts of the world. Also, the founder and some of the employees of Gradle are German.
* Leo-Dict is one of the best online dictionaries I've seen for any non-English language, ever.
* They hate debt and inflation in any form, remembering the hyperinflation from after WW1.
* Simulator games. Oh so very many of them.
* Kalypso Media, Deep Silver, and a few other video game publishers. Also the developers of Sacred, Patrician, and many others.
* They were the most receptive to American football, to the point where ""NFL Europe"" became effectively a German league.
* Realms of Arkania
* One of the sequels to Simon the Sorcerer was released in German first and translated later.
* Lgends of Pegasus

I think a lot of stuff should be done by state or cities, such as policing, education, health care etc. The problem is when the state spirals out of control and hires way too much people to do way too much stuff that the state shouldn't be doing in the first place or makes it financially unsustainable.

I think Finland has reached this point a while ago and politicians should start figuring out what is a high priority that has to be done to maintain as high as possible standard of living to as many people as possible and what can be done without. The important thing right now is to halt the constant increase of debt and concentrate on keeping the necessities as intact as possible.

It doesn't look too good now as Finland has a cabinet that consists of six parties with very different goals, right wing-ish National Coalition party (with the prime minister), Social Democratic party and four smaller parties including even Left Alliance, the furthest left party in parliament. They can't get anything done in this front because they have such different ideas of running the country. The only reason they all are in the same cabinet is because they wanted to keep the populistic right wing party True Finns out after their big election gains in the last elections.

OP, scour the international job sites and see if you can get some phone interviews happening.  Don't come here with just the clothes on your back because it's a pretty high risk.  If you find someone willing to hire you for a salary that you think you can live on, go right ahead.
