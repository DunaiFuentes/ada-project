&gt; Se l'accordo programmatico Pd - m5 sembra cosa semplice, non è detto che l'accostamento indolore al PD sia accettato dagli ex Pdl.  

So che è difficile da capire per le persone politicamente impegnate, ma non tutti gli elettori sposano un partito. Non tutti votano per appartenenza[1]. I voti che prende il m5s da parte di persone che alle passate elezioni hanno votato altro sono voti di persone a cui quell'altro non piace più, e quindi è ragionevole pensare che non ne condividano più le posizioni (perché sono cambiati loro o perché sono cambiati i partiti che hanno votato).  

&gt; Grillo è obbligato a fare la voce grossa con Bersani e con il ""pdmenoelle"", anche se avesse intenzione di lavorarci insieme. I segnali comunque sono tutti positivi: gli attacchi sono tutti personali e non rivolti al PD nella sua interezza.

Infatti. Basta vedere cosa dicono i giovani del PD (quelli veri, non Renzi che sta aspettando che passi la tempesta).

L'intesa su punti programmatici comuni, non certo su un sostegno ad un governo con mano libera.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  Italy (like Japan and United States) have a massive debt for decades, still the raise in bond rates started a couple of years ago only in Italy.

From the euro's inception up until that point, all Eurozone countries had practically the same interest rates, differing by less than a quarter of a percent for a ten year bond. Put differently, had you asked anybody back then how they rated the odds that any Eurozone country could default on its debt within the next ten years, the answer would have been ""practically zero"". Interest rates were just a matter of opportunity costs vs. some other investment.

When the economic crisis hit, this changed. Debt levels went up, and some countries were seen as having a higher risk than others. Government bonds are a very conservative investment. They don't yield very much, people who buy them want security more than a potential profit. So, it wasn't just about debt levels, but about some countries' bonds being perceived as safer investments than others. Those two factors drove up interest rates in the periphery, which made their debt seem less sustainable, which again meant higher interest rates, and the cycle started feeding itself.  
The Greek government admitting the higher than thought debt levels was like pouring gas onto the fire. Now Italy had to contribute to the bailout, and its banks were potentially exposed to a previously unthinkable default of a Eurozone country that eventually did happen. Yet higher interest rates, serious talk about countries leaving the Eurozone, more flight to safety in the core threatening the Italian banking system meant less sustainable debt and higher interest rates still. 

The situation in the US is different. It's less about their level of debt, but about their perceived ability to repay. Arguably, they still have a lot of room for tax increases to pay for it all, something Italy has not. Perhaps (but hopefully not) more importantly, one of the few things you can buy in practically unlimited amounts is US government debt. Got a couple hundred billions lying around you don't know what to do with, say, because you're a Chinese government fund and amass dollars from your trade surplus that need to be exchanged for yuan to pay workers and domestic suppliers with? You can always buy US Treasuries. There are plenty, no matter how hard they try the Fed can't buy them all. This keeps interest rates down.

Not really. Most of the Eurozone countries experienced moderate growth since the introduction of the Euro, or are at the very least stable, economically (Germany, obviously, but also Belgium and the Netherlands, and despite some worries, France as well). 

Italy on the other hand probably would have run into the same troubles that they are in now anyway, at some point. And with regards to your suggestion: ""devaluating"" your way out of a budget crisis is a gamble. It can work, sure, but your standard of living can easily take a hit as well (how do you import stuff if you have a worthless currency?), and you better hope other, bigger economies don't play the devaluation game as well (cough, China) or your gamble might not work all that well anyway.

So the only real losers of the Euro are, in my opinion, Greece and, perhaps, Spain. But in both cases it is very unlikely those countries would have experienced the rapid economic growth that they did in the past decade if they hadn't joined the Eurozone. 

If living standards in Greece fall back to pre-Euro levels, I acknowledge it will be deeply unfair experience to all the Greeks who worked hard and have nothing to show for in the end. But it's also hardly a reason against the Euro *as a whole*. Maybe it's cynical to say it like that, but in the case of Greece, I believe it was a case of *the Euro giveth and the Euro taketh away*.",0,1361984779,null,0,false,0,c8mnr52,t3_19bjuq,t1_c8mnr52,t1_c8mkkiu,null,1431427541,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

&gt; Constitutions usually don't discriminate among different political ideologies. While constitutions of nation-states impose certain limits on legislative politics, primarily through the protection of constitutional rights, it can hardly be argued that, on balance, they privilege one or another political ideology. The EU economic constitution is, in this respect, different. It systematically biases EU policy making in a neo-liberal direction. Historically speaking, this was not the intent of the EU founding fathers. The original constitutional settlement of embedded liberalism was significantly redefined in the next major revisions of the Rome Treaty.

&gt; The neo-liberal foundations of the single market and the EMU have imposed real and significant institutional constraints for progressive policy making. However, the role of the European Left was crucial in this alteration of the EU constitutional order. Despite the strong neoliberal consensus among the key political actors of that time, such a change would have not be possible without the Left' retreat towards centre-leftism, particularly in France. Furthermore, while constrains of the EU economic constitution are significant, we should avoid the naturalization of the EU, depicting it as an automatic upshot of a wholly impersonal logic (Hay, Wincott, 2012, 132). The European Left, while in power, failed to leave its distinct imprint on the EU economic constitution. The Left policy agenda remained firmly embedded in the logic of the nation state.

&gt; The euro crisis pushed these developments even further and, for the first time in the EU history, explicitly challenged the constitutional balance of the EU legal order. The new Austerity Union, a project in the making, profoundly altered this constitutional balance. The new politics of austerity is both politically and economically flawed. It threatens the very foundations of European integration. The euro crisis thus represents both a challenge and opportunity for the Left to offer an alternative response to the biggest EU crisis since its inception. But in order to succeed, the European Left must first reform itself. The PES Manifesto is a promising sign in that direction.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The examples you gave of moments when redditors were contemptuous of Turkey's accession to the EU were not in this thread (except the last one, which was a perfectly valid answer to your comment)... not to mention they received criticism from other redditors... Bad examples.

Do you think the world consists of this thread on reddit? Or that all europeans there is have posted to this thread? Seriously? What does it change if it's on this thread or in another, or in the real world for that matter? Do you even listen to yourself? It's getting too easy to refute your arguments, I'm sure you can do better. I guess that is how ultra-right europeans bullshit around.

&gt;Coming from a Turk, that's pretty humorous. I know your country has never admitted its crimes, or tried to amend for them, unlike most EU countries... maybe that's why you're so oblivious to the comical nature of that comment of yours..

that's cute of you. again, keep your world wars and colonialism sins which are still not admitted and compensated after centuries. A whole damn continent is still suffering as a result of those for god's sake. Clean your own house (if you can with a straight face) before pointing fingers to others. It's funny actually in a pathetic way. The nerve the europeans have sometimes...

&gt;  So there are economic reasons why most developing countries neighboring the EU (like Turkey) want to join.

It's always a trade off. And I'm not sure about the economic reasons. Just today Finance Minister of Germany has called France the sick man of Europe. So again, don't start bragging and have a high-horse attitude. But then again, you're French so that'll happen no matter what I guess. Fun fact: I went to a french-only school in Turkey and all my teachers were french growing up. Donc je peux parler francais. Great people, though they were about x1M times more rational than you.

&gt;You read insulting comments on the internet? You feel your country is being rejected? Suck it up. I'm fucking French, I've seen much more gratuitous insults from other countries, from neighbors like the UK, though especially from Americans.

Haha. there there. I'd offer a hug but I guess I shouldn't really.

&gt;Finally, the whole reason why this conversation started is because you implied Turkey doesn't want to join the EU. Well that link you gave here shows the contrary. Thanks for proving my point.

Yeap. There's a statement from Turkish PM today on this point. I don't see how the link proves your point but sure, I've learned you're just an angry European with very little knowledge about the world and its peoples.

My advice to you is go have talk to people from other countries. And no I don't mean Wallons. The fact that you live in Paris and haven't seen anyone like that says a few things. Perhaps Paris is too much of a monoculture place so try NYC, Berlin or Istanbul.

That US government bonds will be repaid is guaranteed by the US constitution. The US government would most surely print before defaulting, making a US government bond the safest USD-denominated loan one can make for you will always be paid back in full, in nominal terms at least.

Japan finds the same thing - they have a budget that makes not a lick of sense, there's no foreseeable way that their debt could ever be repaid through taxation, yet because it's all denominated in yen and the Japanese government has a yen printing press in its basement, people looking to invest yen figure there is no safer place. The Japanese government gets the lowest interest rate lending attainable in yen accordingly, despite its massive debt.

Essentially if you had a printing press in your basement you'll never find people questioning your ability to pay loans back in the currency that press prints.

Needless to say, the PIIGS have no Euro printing presses. Until the ECB backed them their bond yields were extremely high. The moment it was decided that the ECB would back their bonds - effectively giving them the support of the printing press - bond yields dropped considerably lower as one would expect when one has gained partial support of a printing press.

That's an important distinction, because the loss of purchasing power of this nominally equal amount gets priced into the loan (i.e., higher expected inflation is reflected in higher interest rates). This is normal, always happening and no reason for concern as long as expected inflation remains stable. But the risk is that when interest rates increase, say, because other investments than US Treasuries are seen as more attractive than they are today, the Fed will have to buy more Treasuries to keep interest rates from reaching an unsustainable level. This might well lead to an expectation of higher inflation due to the increased money supply, which in turn would increase interest rates.  
We're still far from this point, though, and the last couple of years have shown that the Fed buying US debt doesn't necessarily cause inflation -- it hasn't so far, and the amounts were truly huge.

There is a point, though, where your hypothetical currency that you print in your basement becomes essentially worthless. I don't think this will happen in the US or Japan any time soon, if ever, but an increase of the interest rates they have to pay would still have some very serious consequences, notably for borrowers who don't have their own printing press for those currencies (e.g., home buyers, businesses) and who presumably would be expected to pay a higher interest rate than their government.",0,1361990870,null,0,false,0,c8mpuls,t3_19bjuq,t1_c8mpuls,t1_c8mpbsh,null,1431428525,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

&gt;I do agree that it lacked some critical information though. Simply a link to the website and such isn't enough. Informing the people about their weekly topics and discussion right away and where to find them would help more. They hold chat sessions and videochats on those on google+ (They don't to give Facebook as much love because of the privacy debacle I guess) for example. They had a public debate somewhere in Ireland and some other places. I know the public that can be reached and debated with like that is limited and more polls or vids where they simply answer questions would probably do a better job.... But still it's something worth mentioning instead of providing a link to a site where it may or may not be hidden behind the events tab. 

&gt;Hell I posted a big EU poll here once about the agricultural reforms and the only way I knew about it was because I was subscribed to some monthly mail from some EU agency. Whilst the other mailing list I was subscribed to, sites, or their social media platforms never seemed to have mentioned it.... I mean they need to improve on how they get the word out. At the same I do understand it if they wanted to keep the recipients limited since reading ten thousands of text responses (some of which are from trolls/'anti-EU people who never heard about constructive criticism') is no half work.

Let me explain. I'm also adding CountVonTroll's reply to you.

&gt; Less austerity e.g., for Greece, would mean higher transfers from other countries

Absolutely not. It was *more* austerity that initiated *higher* transfers, because the economy got worse. I know what some people will say: it's Greece the one to blame. Clearly, this is not the case, because we've seen similar effects in countries inside and outside of the eurozone, with healthier economies, before and after the so-called ""bailouts"". Countries with debts lower than Germany's. Not to mention that you didn't take money from your accounts and gave them away. It doesn't work like that.

Merkel's administration (please, notice how I'm phrasing this) was ideologically opposed in using ECB's firepower from the start. In the end, they were *forced* to do so, using *vastly* larger amounts of money, and are *very* reluctant to tell the truth about it. I'm sorry, but Greece is the convenient scapegoat here. Now, Cyprus is another scapegoat. We're seeing Germany talking about an inflated bank sector and low corporate tax, while turning a blind eye in home and beyond, for similar cases.

It's increasingly difficult to talk about the realities in a power game, where Germans, Greeks, and others are the victims. If one German does a stupid thing, he is suddenly a Nazi. If a Greek mentions the mistakes with Germany's approach to austerity, he is by default wrong.

Their EU membership would benefit both EU and Ukraine, even if it was next year. In comparison to Greece (money sink without economy except tourism, huge support for nazi party, nobody can rule them) Ukraine membership in EU is nobrainer.

When I was in Ukraine in 2007 it was like Poland in 1995. Wild capitalism, relicts of communism everywhere, people struggling with new world around them. But most stereotypes were false - everybody were friendly, nobody asked me for bribe, the cities weren't less clean tha Polish or German for that matter. Their roads are awful, but then - Polish ones were awful too even 10 years ago.

Many Ukrainians work or study in Poland, my uncle wife is Ukrainian. They are very similar culturaly to Poles. They just had less political luck after 1989. These structural problems are not caused by regular Ukrainians, but by their ""elites"". Who has access to the best business opportunities - trading gas, contracts for army, etc, to media, everywhere. And nobody in Ukraine will deal with these people, if there's no hope for Ukrainians that it will pay off. They see how Turkey accession is treated. They see that EU has own problems. They see that Russia is doing economicaly OK. Half of them feel like Russians anyway. EU acting like girl out of Ukraines league is only making things worse.

How to change that - Ukrainians tried in ""Orange revolution"". They lost, mainly because of lack of support from ""the West"". Yeah - we helped them during the protest and the elections. But later, when their first more or less democratic government had to deal with all these structural problems - we looked the other way. We should be encouraging reforms, giving hope to Ukrainians, making business with them. Instead we (our politicians) said ""maybe some day"".

Most countries under the Euro have experienced little to no growth (&lt; 0.5% pa) since 2007 in GDP/capita terms. The only that have experienced growth are Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands. That's the complete list.

In particular, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain have negative to no progress at all to show for the past 5 years.

When I have time I'd love to compile a graph of growth in the years on the run-up to the Euro for each nation vs the years since - it's something I'd be very interested to see.

&gt; If living standards in Greece fall back to pre-Euro levels,

They already have.

Greece had $12887 GDP/capita when it joined the Euro in 2004.

2012, Greece had $12653 GDP/capita.

2013 will be worse again.

Negative growth is all they have to show for 9 years of economic activity under the Euro.

And that's just GDP - actual living standards, job stats etc, are considerably worse. The numbers are absolutely horrific, and the damage it'll do down the track will be far reaching.

Not necessarily, for government debt is non-government savings. If the non-government wants to have net savings in the currency the government issues, the government must be in net debt.

If the savings demands of the non-government are not met due to the public sector forcing down its debt, the paradox of thrift sets in and you see rising unemployment as some households save at the expense of others.

Don't follow? We have debt based monetary systems. If you have $20 in your wallet, that $20 was created by *someone* going into debt. It is someone's liability. In fact, if your financial position is $20 of net savings - the rest of the economy has $20 of net debt. The rest of the economy *owes you* $20, for that's what money is, money is debt.

The same applies at the macro level - if the government is in net debt of $1tn, the non-government has $1tn of net savings. If we force governments to be $0 in debt, we are forcing our own net savings to be $0.

This isn't because those countries weren't ready (though that's a factor) but also because the EU's not ready. There are problems with representation in the EU parliament and more importantly in things like the council of ministers and *oh dear*: treaty change. Treaty change is becoming impossible now due to the number of members. The EU has to become much more transparent and much more democratic before it can start expanding. I think it's already a little over expanded ever since Poland Greece came. We've added a lot more member states since then. It's time to say enough and deal with internal problems. If the EU can't maintain a competent government then it can hardly ensure peace in Europe and the smooth running of things. Ukraine and Turkey are just the point we're realising these thing.

See, the Fed sets the rate at which banks lend to one another. It can set these rates at zero by buying assets off them to the point they have a heap of cash (today) - or very high, by withdrawing funds by offering them more attractive investment options such as bonds.

Now if you're a bank and you reason that the Fed is going to have you lend to other banks at an average rate of 5% interest per year - government bonds, irrespective of how much debt the government has, irrespective of government's revenue, are attractive even at 6%.

One thing investors can do is exchange their currency with investors holding other currencies, except ultimately, the free-floating exchange rate just slips a bit and finds a new stable level - a level where people are looking at the massive assets and export capacity of the US and decide they'd like a piece of that. They want to buy USD whilst it's cheap, for they expect it to rise later. And where can be safer to invest that USD than in a US government bond?

&gt; There is a point, though, where your hypothetical currency that you print in your basement becomes essentially worthless.

I never have to actually activate the printing press. As long as people know I have infinite capacity to pay back all bonds as they fall due I'll never have issue selling bonds to pay back existing bonds. I can just roll over debt as much as I like - I never need to actually pay it down. No more than Japan does, no more than the US does.

The only restraint on a currency-issuing government's spending is inflation. They are not revenue constrained by any meaningful sense of the word, for they can always issue more bonds if they find themselves short of revenue.

That should be enough for the pro-austerity argument.

However austerity has also been used for all kinds of silly issues from breaking up monopolies to easing labour restrictions and doing away with absurd perks for certain classes. And the basis fact is that Europe have a pressing need – have had for many decades – to clean up, open up, and become more internationally competitive.

Nations such as Greece can not print more money to fund their programs because they are members of the Euro, so that is out of the question. This is why some advocate for the return to the Drachma. Greece could inflate their own currency, which could fund spending as well as help the Greek export industry.

Taxation is the main way governments acquire money, but once you reach a certain point, it is hard to raise more money via taxation. Greece, Italy, Spain, etc could raise taxes massively on the wealthy and middle class, and do nothing but harm their economies as people move their money overseas and stop spending as much.

So, governments borrow to make up the shortfall. If you are seen as creditworthy, this is fine. This is what allows the US and Japan to borrow heavily.

Das Bild von Homosexualität in der Gesellschaft ist leider irgendwie verquer, leider auch zum Teil von Homosexuellen selbst verschuldet.

Excerpts:

+ *""Linking our resources and economy helped us preserve peace in the EU for almost 70 now"".* People after WW2 didn't fear another Franco-German war igniting Europe, they feared war between the West and the East, between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Thermonuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles that would lead to Mutually Assured Destruction, if war happened, had a ""little"" more weight than some treaty between a handful of nations.

+ ""*Membership of the EU means access to a market of 500M citizens, which means more growth""* You don't need to handover your sovereignty and go against your nation's interests to do business, and boy do we have growth since 1992.

+ *""More opportunities to work and live in other EU countries""*: [Article 63 of the TFEU](http://euwiki.org/TFEU#Article_63) forbids restricting off-shoring, not only between member states, but **between member states and third countries**, such as China. How can my country's industry compete fairly against this ?

+ *""We live in an increasingly globalized world, and large countries outside the EU are shaping our future*"":see above, the EU is contributing to globalization. And if the EU is to act as a counterweight to the ""large countries"", [why are the U.S.  in favor of Turkey joining and thus ""strengthening"" the E.U ?](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/5113786/Barack-Obama-backs-Turkey-over-EU-membership.html) But that wouldn't surprise me, since [the Daily Telegraph showed, from declassified US documents, that the European construction was financed by US spy chiefs](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1356047/Euro-federalists-financed-by-US-spy-chiefs.html).

+ *""EU countries share the same values and concerns"":* False. Germany's economy thrives on a strong currency, and it's in the German's culture, they want to stay as far as possible from a 1924 catastrophe, French are secular, want strong social services and a cheap currency, Eastern Europe don't trust their governments, are ultra-capitalists and want NATO protection against the threat of Russia. Feel free to add to this.

+ *""to participate in shaping our common future"":* Sure, if you exclude all the big questions like customs, competition rules for the internal market, monetary policy for the EMU, ecological questions/fisheries policy, common commercial policy, as [the European Commission has **exclusive competence** on those areas](http://euwiki.org/TFEU#Article_3). Feel free to talk about meat and the European identity, though.

title: ""Join the debate on Europe.""

You know. A while ago they did weekly public chat sessions, Q&amp;A's with MEPs and public debates. Occasionally they send out polls though I admit they should advertise them more.

Maybe. That depends on how you measure contribution. The Russians were facing a bigger army, lost more men and actually reached Berlin on their own. 

The Polish did crack the 2 of the 3 (Army, Air Force, Navy) Enigma encryptions. I think they couldn't crack the Navy codes. 

The British (Turing, to be specific) made the Enigma useless and developed another encryption the Nazis found that was so good that the Nazis didn't even try seriously to crack the encryption. The British work was based on the Polish work. So if you talk about lives saved, the combined work of the British and Polish is leading here.

If you talk about brute force, the Americans lead. But they joined last. If the British had joined last or the Australians or Canadians, would that mean that they were the important part of defeating Germany? I'm not sure if the Americans would have got out of that war as well as they did if they were attacked by the Nazis is much as the other nations were. 

&gt; Really? You seriously think there would be any wars between EU members if it didn't exist?

There were thousands of years of war in Europe. At any given time, there were conflicts somewhere. Just look at old European maps and how the borders have changed. Those borders didn't change just cause. They mostly changed because of war. If we had continued as usual after a war, it might end in some more conflicts.

And even if you think about the fact that the USA has put a lot of money into the German economy after the war to rebuild the country, it wasn't a US only thing. A lot of Germans give the French a lot of credit for giving us the Saarland back (which had some coal which is why the French got it in the first place). The Russians released the war prisoners as soon as Adenauer went to Russia. That could have ended differently as well.

First of all ""rezensieren"" (=recensor) doesn't exist. You are looking for ""überarbeiten"" (=revise)/""korrekturlesen"" (= proofread) or something similar.

""Report"" sounds a bit weird as well. Looks more like a small ""Aufsatz"" to me.

Unlike the English ""Can you"" ""Kannst du"" refers to one specific person and not the whole group of redditors/readers. ""Kann jemand"" (=Can somebody) or ""Könnt ihr"" (=""Can you"", refering to a group) fit better.

Together that would make:

You get the general mening across but it's poorly worded and I don't know what exactly you want to express. Could you give me the English version?

&gt;Gutenberg Bible war die erste Geschichte gedruckt. 200 Exemplare in Lateinischer Sprache wurden gedruckt.

The first sentence translates to ""Gutenberg bible was the first history pressed"". I assume you want to say ""The Gutenberg bible was the first book pressed in history"". The second sentence is mostly fine but saying ""pressed"" twice in a row is bad style. I've switched it with ""produced"".

Die Gutenberg-Bibel war das erste gedruckte Buch der Geschichte. Es wurden 200 Exemplare in lateinischer Sprache produziert.

&gt;Seit dieser Erfindung, es viele Bedeutung des Buchdruckes gab. Das Buch war einem Massen Artikel geworden. Es auch hatte Beginn der Neuzeit markiert. Es erlaubt einen schnelleren Austausch von Ideen. Es ist verantwortlich für die heutige moderne Drucktechnik, wie des Computers, den alphabetischen Schrift, und der Sprache.

Don't you remember the $34B cash bribe just before he lost the 2007 election? Don't you remember all of the middle-class welfare he dished out? Peter Costello famously fought with Howard to constrain his profligacy.

And don't you remember immediately prior to the GFC, we had inflation and interest rates that were far higher than they should have been (which is a quantifiable way of showing that the government was spending too much)?

Numbers don't lie, buddy. Howard was a spendthrift. Doesn't matter what the media was telling us (all that rubbish about ""good economic management"". Ha! Bullshit.)

&gt; They are simply better at running the economy.

Nup, sorry. Both Labor and Liberal are exactly the same on the economy. They both take orders from Treasury. And Treasury is good at running the economy\* - they are the guys who deserve the credit. Not our stupid politicians and *definitely* not Howard.

The Liberals have this mystical aura of ""economic responsibility"" for no reason more deep than they like to hob nob with business types. And business likes to think it knows how to run an economy. Mainly because they think running a business is the same as running an economy (they're related, but *not* the same thing).

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Germany went through something of a pre-debt cancellation economic miracle between 1950 and 1953. Plenty of cheap skilled labourers post-war. The Allies had stopped dismantling German industry (coal and steel), which opened the doors for Germany to start using that again. The Allies had taken parts from 706 factories. Redevelopment of course required work, but that's about as cut and dry as any government policy you'll ever see. Germany knew full well it had strong industrial capabilities. You can take the parts but the resources are still in the ground. 

A slightly more specific example is that Major Hirst (British soldier running Volkswagen post-WW2) left in 1949, and Volkswagen became property of the West German government. Much like other areas of industry, this now represented a great opportunity for growth.

Then the Korean War. Germany more than doubled its exports during this war due to demand for goods.

Of course all this still led to an economy that required the debt cancellations of 1953. That Debt consisted of roughly 15bn marks from WWI reparations (Germany volunteered to pay that back) and 15bn post-WWII. That was cancelled to about 15bn total, which everyone was aware the West German economy (because of the aforementioned reasons and their expected future growth) could easily handle.

The WWI reparations ended in 2010. Thats not important, its just a fun relevant fact. [Enjoy.](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2023140,00.html)",0,1362014953,null,0,false,0,c8myb0s,t3_19cxbb,t1_c8myb0s,t1_c8mxy07,null,1431432722,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

- On immigration: [""Citizenship to immigrants' children born in Italy? It's nonsense. Better, there's a sense: to distract Italians from real problems and turn them into \(football\) supporters.

- [One of the many attacks on Umberto Veronesi](http://www.beppegrillo.it/2008/02/cancronesi.html)  (Famous Oncologist), accused of having a cancer creation business: For Grillo, Veronesi is denying the dangers of waste incinerators and having energy companies financing his cancer foundation, in order to spread cancer so he could make money by treating it.

Now he paints himself as a web guru and the net as the solution to many italian problems. (also from his 20 points program: free internet connection to everyone)  

I need to point out that very few voted for him because they believed all the stuff he says, the majority of his votes are protest votes against the Italian political system and against austerity measures. Of course, the idea that left-wing parties and workers' unions are as bad as (if not worst than) Berlusconi, is the major talking point on which many italians believed him, helped by some scandals inside the party and by the fact that it's the same picture that was painted on daily basis by Berlusconi's televisions for the past 20 years.  
At the moment, many of his voters are vocally asking the movement to  enter a political coalition with the left-wing party in order to reform the country. Grillo of course is strongly against it, hoping that left and right will end up having to make a government together, so he can stay outside and keep screaming against them.

Since I lived in Salonica during his years as a mayor, and I was getting angry with him and some of his loyal followers I will try to describe what his tenure was like.

First off he would like, hand out jobs and money to his followers, that's how you get to steal 30-50 million, not by some kind of magical trick where the politician deceives the unsuspecting voters. You've got to shut a few mouths first (5 000+ in his case). Today some of the people that benefited from him (keep in mind that some of them were poor and it made sense in a social welfare kind of thing, except others were just extorting money) had the classical populist excuse you'll often hear in greek politics ""others were stealing much more than him"" (as if 50 million is not enough)

During his years he would initiate construction work, 90% of the time unneeded, done half assed (to justify redoing it), and at 3 times the normal price. People were complaining that he would re-change the pavements for the 4th time in a year or something. The city also had a TV station where he somehow hired like 700 people, rumored to be doing nothing and getting paid for it. Some journalists there were sucking up to him to a vomit inducing degree while complaining about everyone else being corrupt (off course it turns out the journalists were corrupt too) He hired a lot of municipal cops (I knew a guy who worked 4 hours a week for 1000 euros). And I 've heard of a few more Papageorgopoulos people that some of them got rich, some got accepted at universities without much in credentials etc..  He would also organize some expensive musical festival twice every year (to keep the people happy or sth).

What is fucked up is that everyone knew he was stealing, but no one cared. I mean his main political opponent as a mayor had given proof (not that it was needed) that he was doing what the court now accused him of, and no one paid attention. In fact the more proof she presented the less popular she'd get amongst voters. It took the economical crisis and the need for ""political blood"", for the case to proceed. People would dismiss the accusations and were being like ""I don't give a fuck"", and he was getting called something that translates to ""life sentence mayor"", well he did get that life sentence in the end.",0,1362024444,null,0,1362033206,0,c8n1kws,t3_19cq5s,t1_c8n1kws,t1_c8mwd0v,null,1431434264,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9
true,Krastain,null,null,"For the linguistically interested under us, there are two 'wordfamilies' for cheese in use in most of western and southern Europe. One is the cheese/käse/queso group, the other the formaggi/fromage group. Both groups come from latin. 

Latin for cheese is *caseus*, which is the root for the first group. Latin for hard (or formed) cheese is *caseus formatus* where the word *formaticum* came to be used as an other word for cheese. This is the root for the second group.

On one hand it is to be expected that large parts (almost all) of what was once the European part of the Roman empire still use words for cheese deriving from latin. On the other hand though, in non-Romance languages, like German, English and Breton, most words for things very down to earth and 'peasanty' have retained their old linguistic roots, but not cheese. Although I can't say this for certainty, I suspect that the Scandinavian word *ost* (it's linguistic parent of course) was the one being replaced by *caseus* in the west-Germanic languages.

Per essere coerente con quanto affermato sino ad ora, al colle dovrebbero salire i capigruppo del M5S (quelli che cambiano ogni 3 mesi) con in mano una sorta di sintesi delle posizioni espresse nel sito, magari con un sondaggio online, e leggerle paro paro a Napolitano. Uno vale uno.

Quello che succederà, per quanto emerso negli ultimi 2 giorni, è che Grillo salirà al colle e dirà quello che il M5S farà. E se qualcuno ha qualcosa da dire, eletti o elettori che siano, fuori dalle palle. Mica male come inizio di democrazia diretta.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Greece is the poster child for austerity...

I don't hold Greece as a poster boy for austerity because Greece has been forced to cut spending in order to get it's severe deficit and interest rates under control. It has not been done to cause growth, and nobody expects it alone to produce growth (not Greece, not IMF, not EMU). What is expected to bring growth are the necessary *structural reforms*, e.g.: 

* income tax reform
* bridging the competitiveness gap
* productivity growth
* liberalizing product and service markets
* opening sectors to competition (like retail sector only some months ago)
* opening overly regulated professions (over 500 in Greece and account for about one-third of employment)
* privatization
* etc

Greece has done a lot but slowly and there's still far more to do. Here's a good summary: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2013/int011813a.htm

&gt; Greece: Snapshot of Reform Results  
• A reinforced financial system. Deposits have been returning to the banking system since mid-2012. Core banks have been recapitalized, and their balance sheets significantly strengthened. Greek banks now have little exposure to the Greek state.  
• A more competitive labor market. Unit labor costs have dropped by 15 percent since their pre-crisis peak. The minimum wage has been reduced by over 20 percent, the system for setting the minimum wage has been reformed (with the influence of insiders reduced dramatically), severance costs have been cut back, and onerous pre-approval requirements for work schedules and overtime have been eliminated.  
• A more affordable pension system. Reforms will reduce pension spending from 17 percent in 2012 to about 14 percent of GDP in 2013, closer to the euro area average of 12 percent of GDP. Pensions below €1000 per month have been left untouched, to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected.  
• More affordable prices and more consumer choice. Prices in Greece have now begun to fall. While progress has been too limited when it comes to instilling competition into important sectors of the economy, there have been some recent successes which point to further gains ahead. The retail sector in Greece was liberalized in late 2012. The sector has been characterized by high prices—especially for food—with productivity lagging the EU-15 average by 30-40 percent.

I tried to explain it like this: Imagine you have a relative who is known to squander his money and is not keeping his jobs. Now it went fine for a few years, but suddenly all went downhill. He's about to lose his car/flat and whatnot.

First things will be you try to stop the fall. Maybe help him sell the car and give him money so he can keep his flat and have something to eat. Is the next move giving him even more money? Or do you want to see him actually changing his lifestyle? I'd say the latter. That's the austerity imposed by the more successful countries in the Eurozone. They will still pay for a few things that are really necessary, but I don't think anybody would suggest that paying him (the relative) or them (the countries in crisis) a monthly income would actually change anything.

So after a certain amount of time, people (an economist would call it ""the market"") will actually redevelop trust. They'll probably be willing to ease the measures.

I think it makes a lot of sense. The question will be, when do we redevelop trust in, for example, Greece?",0,1362050318,null,0,false,0,c8n6h7m,t3_19bjuq,t1_c8n6h7m,t1_c8mkbm9,null,1431436681,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Tickets, though, are not available yet, so you will have to wait.

Regarding the section, I think you can safely follow the game in Curva Ferrovia, which is a supporter section but it is a really welcoming place, american students watching games are often seen here. Otherwise, if you care for a better view you can consider buying a ""Maratona"" ticket, which are a bit more pricey. Note that both Ferrovia and Maratona are not covered seats, the only option for a covered seat is to get a ""Tribuna"" ticket.

true,t_maia,SAAN,Sachsen-Anhalt,"Coming from California your biggest challenge will be dealing with some limits in your diet. Especially when you are in a small town and shopping at small supermarkets in winter the choice in fresh vegs and fruits can be a bit boring. 

I distinctively remember a Cali girl complain about the lack of choice of fresh vegs - she was used to the variety of big Cali supermarkets. My reaction was like ""What do you expect, it is winter? Anything fresh has to come from Chile, Egypt or the hothouses in Spain.""

The supermarket around the corner that I frequent is not very large. Essentially they have now bell peppers, soup mix vegs (bundle of carrots, celery, leeks, parsley), red cabbage, white cabbage, carrots, onions and potatoes as staples with the occassional addition of courgettes, fennel, aubergines, brokkoli and cauliflower thrown in. At the end of the day, they are frequently out of certain things. It is a big change compared to what is on offer in some of the bigger stores in the USA. Most people rotate through 2-4 different supermarkets to get what they want/need. 

Marktkauf, Real and Kaufland would be the closest to what you are used to. 

In regards to vegs, many people resort to frozen stuff. One of the cheapest meals is frozen ""Asian veg mix"". A bag of the stuff that lasts for 3 meals goes for around 1-1.40 EUR. Throw the desired amount into a pan, stir-fry and add some boiled rice and soy sauce - makes dinner for less than one euro.  There is also french veg mix and italian veg mix for variety.

Austerity is/was absolutely essential for some of the PIIGS nations. They had accumulated an unsustainable standard of living that wasn't backed by their economic performance.

They needed to go through a harsh adaption process that brought down their standard of living back to a level supported by their economies. That this was a harsh and unpopular process is without doubt.

But realistically it was/is the only option since turning up inflation was no longer within the power of individual EU nations. There is no other way to support multiple failing nations.

And to be fair, even government stimulus packages can only do so much to revive an economy. Even with Billions of Euros invested you cannot halt an economic down-turn, especially if it is Europe wide.

That said, once a country has gone through its austerity reform process and is back on track, then you should absolutely invest in it and try to bring it back to a nice standard of living.

Regarding Merkel however, I think she is highly overrated and I don't understand why she is still so popular in Germany.

Where can I get the numbers for this? Especially those who refuse the ""fakelaki"". It seems impossible to measure.

&gt;    no more general strikes or riots

Just...no. You can't demand ""no more strikes"" no matter what happens. Some grievances are legitimate.

&gt;    Contributions to the Greece Debt Free project

Cool project, but hardly realistic to expect the same citizens that get by salary-to-salary to contribute approximately 4.500 euros each (which is more since the 11.8m population includes the young and the elderly). This is mostly directed towards foreigners and the wealthy.

&gt;    An end to voting for politicians who blame others for the crisis or provide other easy answers

Agreed. Easier said than done. The most popular party right now is SYRIZA which while disconnected from previous governments and corruption, doesn't seem to have a sold plan and is quite heavily stroking the ears of the voters.


&gt;Actions like for example Greeks who committed tax fraud coming out and publicly announcing that they'll not only pay the debt they owe, but twice the amount as this would encourage others to follow their example.

Again, this applies to a very small wealthy percentage because only those would have the ""luxury"" to do so. I am not saying tax fraud is moral but some people simply do not have the money. Also, tax fraud is a punishable offence so they'd be up for criminal charges as well. Good luck with that.

&gt;Donations to soup kitchens and other charities caring for those who are most stricken by the crisis.

Ummm, sure? This is already happening but I don't see how it is related.

&gt;A public announcement not to send relief supplies to Greece because they are more pressingly needed elsewhere.

Who the hell is sending relief supplies? It's not a warzone, what's needed is a plan, not shipments of food. I haven't heard of any distribution of relief supplies in Greece although I might be misinformed. You might be refering to monetary aid; are you?

&gt; Less amusement, more education (and by ""education"" I mean education out of one's own free will, motivation, and means, not necessarily more money for schools).

Again, impossible to quantify, not to say completely subjective. I also fail to see how this displays ""remorse"".

Starker Atheimus, wie du es nennst, kann ja ziemlich leicht auseinandergenommen werden, da es sich im Grunde dabei auch nur um einen Glauben handelt: Ich glaube, dass es keinen (irgendwiegearteten) Gott gibt. Beweisen kann man es nicht. Für Theisten ist das natürlich ein gefundenes Fressen. Und in diversen Dikussionen stürtzt man sich da auch gerne drauf. Die Argumente sind ziemlich ähnlich denen, die man gegenüber jedem Glauben ins Feld führen kann. Ich persönlich fühle mich von starken Atheisten noch weit mehr angeekelt als von Theisten: Theisten haben es so gelernt und fertig. Starke Atheisten haben es sich selber ausgesucht und sind der gleichen Pseudowissenschaft auf den Leim gegangen nur genau um 180° gedreht.

Wie gesagt, sich als Atheist zu bezeichnen birgt sehr große Probleme in sich, wenn man mit den anderen in einen Topf geworfen wird.

Daher ist es meiner Meinung nach klüger, selbst als schwacher Atheist, sich als Agnostiker zu sehen und zu bezeichnen, da man sich damit von gewissen Fanaten abgrenzt und eine Linie zieht.

**Café Finlandaise** - has been sitting in the pot for at least eight hours, creating a unique consistency akin to burnt bile. Taste: syrupy, black like the winter in Äkäslompolo, strong as death. A gas station specialty.

**Latteé** (play on the word *lattea*, flat) - weak pot brewed coffee due to insufficient amount of coffee grounds and not feeling up to go to the grocery store. Milk or cream added if needed. Tip: roll a lump from the coffee grounds and stick it under your lip if the Latteé is too bland.

**Caffé Brutal** - the opposite of Latteé, usually due to failed dosage of coffee grounds. Gets your bodily waste materials going. Taste: roasted anger, accompanied by piquant arrhythmia and blurring of the somewhat sparkling field of vision.

**Caffé Incorretto** - Café Finlandaise with [Koskenkorva.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koskenkorva_Viina) In other words, a desperate attempt to dissolve the aforementioned goo into a more liquid form using alcohol. Notice: also known as Caffé con Kossu. Often served with whipped cream.

**Microcchino** - cold pot brewed coffee, resurrected in the microwave oven. Also known as Café Lazarus. Taste: a well-made Microcchino can be identified by a bitter layer of fat stuck to the palate.

**Caffé con Muffa** - traditional Finnish pot brewed coffee with added spoiled milk. The greener the coffee, the better. Notice: pour the milk carefully with the help of a spoon so that the fine fur coating stays on the surface.

Some do not have the nerves to stand the amount of work required and give up after 1 year or even before that.

Everyone, even those who give up on it after 6 or 12 months, learns a lot of things. Obviously you learn a lot about your field, eg maths/physics/economics/literature etc but more importantly about studying. You learn how to manage your time, be it studytime or leasuretime. You learn how to deal with stress, with intensive oral and written exams.
Yes it usually means you have less time for hanging out, for going to drink or for going to concerts. But you can still do that. As long as you're well organized.

I don't think anyone who's been through CPGEs really regrets doing it. Sure it is tough, but you really get to know yourself better, and you learn how to study/work. Actually the rest of your studies may seem boring or dull, which is why many people get involved in the student life of where they end up at :)

If you have the possibility to go to a CPGE, I highly recommend you take it. The people from my class who dropped joined ""easier"" studies and were the best of their classes without effort.

In the Netherlands, coffee capsules or pads (like Senseo) are extremely popular at homes. Most coffee I've encountered is rather weak, especially compared to the rat poison I drank in Hungary.

true,Clit_Commander,TURK,Döner im Weckla,"Every discussion about the turkish minority is heated, so that's normal, get used to it :)

From my point of view germans are over reacting very much when talking about immigration, everybody seems to know someone who got into a fight with a turk or other immigrant, got robbed etc., they create the image of a Germany that would be a peaceful country without crime or whatever. But the crime rate is dropping continuosly. And there was crime before migration started in the 1960s. So it's bullshit. Of course immigrants and also turks are overrepresented in the crime statistics but there is a reason for this, I blame the public disinterest in integrating foreigners to the country. These people need simply help getting started, this would lower the crime rate significantly, a mandatory Kindergarten attendance for immigrants would help many families getting involved here. But it seems like many people are glad when the immigrants don't sent their children to the Kindergarten. 

But on your questions:

&gt; But, what do you think? Is your Option 1 or Option 2 more common? Is the majority of turks (young/old) really opposed to the german lifestyle? Actively even?

Option 2 for sure. At least where I live (Nürnberg). The ""problem"" is that the religious part of the turkis immigrants is more visible. We are always talking and discussing the individuals that don't want to integrate in the western society but not about the many, many immigrants that are ""invisible"" that have a job and live a normal life. 

I think the younger generations are pretty much integrated and embrace the western lifestyle, but the 1st generation of immigrants is definitively NOT integrated. My parents don't speak german at all, they never needed to, in fact my father told me when he came to Germany people disencoureged him to learn german because he would be sent back to Turkey in a few years. 

&gt; How strong is the ""modernist"" movement in your community?

I'm not sure what you mean by ""modernist movement""...please explain.

&gt;  Do you see yourself as German or Turkish (or a mix)?

Very difficult question, very easy answer: I'm turkish. I used to think about me as a german for a long time because I was born here, went to school, had the german citizenship etc. but I realized that the german society would always see me as a turk as long as I had a turkish name and would refuse to assimilate. 

A different, difficult question would be ""Where is your homeland?"", there is no easy answer to this. I blend in perfectly to the german society but I'm not accepted by many people. I'm accepted in Turkey but I can't integrate there because I'm used to another culture. When I'm in Turkey I miss Germany, when I'm in Germany I miss Turkey...weird situation...

&gt; What do you think about Germans? Are we too nice or too negative towards you guys?

No german ever was ""too nice"" to me because I'm turkish :)

But many have been hostile because I'm turkish, there was this one teacher I had in 5th grade Gymnasium, at the first day he told us that we should all be sent back to where we come from (we had two classes in 5th grade and miraculously one of the classes was germans only and mine was a wild mix of nationalities).

I got in trouble when I went out drinking etc...

A lot of people confuse a calm focus with apathy. Just because she hysteric and reactive to everything the press throws out there doesn't mean that she doesn't have a vision. People let her do her job and so far shes doing it well enough.

In October I had a lengthy chat with the father of a friend of mine on this subject, who is a macro economics professor and about to retire soon. This guy knows more about economics than everyone else I know will ever forget. 

And his message was clear, no one knows what is the right thing to do. And no one that is respected as an economist claims to know it. His personal opinion was that austerity has it's dangers, but again, no one knows.

At it the end of the day, he said, the only way to fix this is that the people in power and with money get their shit together and step up to their responsibility towards society.

That said, I don't want to be a ""chercheur-ingenieur"" or ""ingenieur."" I would probably go into something more ""business related"", but we never know, right?

It's not easy, ecoles d'ingénieurs typically do not have any philosophy/literature course. In the top ones you have a bunch of law/economics/management, in others you have an introduction to these subjects. But the classical ""cultural"" aspect is not very present in ecoles d'ingénieurs

&gt;How often could you go out with your friends?

Depends on how much time you study, but usually I would see friends / go out / do sports the on the saturday afternoon/evening. Rest of the time though (evenings of weekdays, sundays) was mostly working/sleeping though. 

&gt;Do French students drink a lot, in general?

In prépas, no. Later on, more. A bit more or a lot more, depending on the person.

&gt;On another forum, I heard people mention ""des soirees tranquilles"" where people just hang out in a friend's room/apartment and drink wine.

It really depends on the people. In my school there's the ""party-goers"" who probably drink more on average, play beer-pong and do whatever they do. There's also a lot of people who can appreciate a movie night or a games night (Jungle Speed, Time's Up, quizzes, you name it) so it's no different than in other fields I guess ?

&gt;Did you feel somewhat ""imprisoned"" by the curfew or the rules of the prepa? Did it feel too much like school?

CPGEs sure feel a lot like French high school. It's like intensive high-level high school where you (this time, for real) for yourself and only yourself.
The main issue here is : do you think you are mature enough to study on your own ? Because if you go university, you'll be on your own and noone will really be here to motivate you to work, really. And it's SO easy to get bad habits and drop. A very big trap. On the contrary, in CPGE you will have the best and most motivated teachers you've ever had, other motivated students and your own motivation. Whenever you're down, the teachers will be here to remind you that you need to work hard. So that's a pretty big advantage if you have (pretty common among CPGE students) gone through HS without really working and don't have a method.

&gt;Based on your observations, did students have enough time on their hands to maintain a relationship? 

Not impossible, but tough. First, will your SO be in a CPGE or another highly competitive studying environment like médecine, pharmacologie or anything else ? Then it can work. If your SO remains in HS or at the university, it's going to be way tougher. Second, after the 2 years of CPGE you usually end up in another city. Will he/she be able/willing to move ? Third, life in écoles d'ingénieurs is so different from HS and CPGE, your expectations will be different, tons of new people at your school, etc ...
All in all, it's definitely doable but requires a bit of luck as well as a well-constructed relationship beforehands.",0,1362070382,null,0,false,0,c8namfw,t3_19ebo8,t1_c8namfw,t1_c8n8yk8,null,1431438719,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3
true,Silly_Crotch,PACA,PACA,"Hi! I was in prépa. I attended A/L for a year before going to an IEP. A good number of my friends attended prépa for 3 years, be it in A/L, B/L or BCPST. My prépa was the third best in the country in A/L when I attended it, and it has always been in the top-10.

I personally had a great experience while managing to be at the top of my class. And, believe me, I am not a genius. It is certainly **not** the military. It might be different if you intend to live in internat, but prépa is not as rigid as it is made out to be. What I discovered was a great atmosphere of people helping each-other to succeed. People were working together and I can't remember anyone being left out who did not want to be. Professors, while they can be very straightforward and (obviously) want a focused classroom environment, will have time for you. You also are going to have amazing professors who know and most importantly love, what they are talking about. You are advocating small prépas in your post. I'd say there is a reason bigger, public prépas get better results. Some private CPGEs are just here to rip off students and their professors are glorified high school teachers. One of my friends went to such an establishment and I would strongly recommend against it. Besides, the difference in personalized attention you will get between a classroom of 40 people and one of 20 is not as big as you make it out to be.

Prépa does not feel that much like lycée. In my prépa, everything was done for the interactions with high schoolers to be as limited as possible. It has the advantage that, like in lycée, you can study a wide array of subjects. 

Finally, social life ! I met some of my best friends in prépa. I met an amazing girl I dated for more than a year. While big parties are not really my thing, some were organized be it by my class or our BDE. There is also a lot of more low-key stuff going on. You most probably won't lack for friendships. That being said, 3 years with the same people can get annoying. If your goal is not necessarily the ENS/école des Chartes/école du Louvre etc. I would recommend going just a year or two. 

Also, know that a successful year in a good prépa gives you a ""licence 1""in two subjects of your choosing. Two years give you a licence 2, and three years a licence. By the way, you do speak perfect French right? B/L is not A/l but it is still very humanities-heavy.

true,Kit_Emmuorto,vaticano,,"* Elezioni: Grillo con la maggioranza alla Camera ma non al Senato succede solo se gli elettori fanno in massa il voto utile levandosi lo sfizio di votare Grillo alla Camera dove pensavano il centrosinistra avrebbe vinto comunque e scodellando responsabilità al Senato votando centrosinistra (o, in proporzione minore e non influente, i partiti di centrodestra da cui provenivano). A livello di numeri, significa che alla Camera la situazione è M5s a 340 seggi, centrosinistra e centrodestra sostanzialmente pari a cento e spiccioli ciascuno (magari centrosinistra qualcosa in più), Monti che non conta un cazzo. Al Senato, se calcoliamo che l'operazione travaso voti va solo da Grillo al centrosinistra e per il centrodestra il saldo è zero, allora la situazione è più o meno la stessa: maggioranza dei seggi al centrodestra per via delle regioni chiave, maggioranza dei voti al centrosinistra, una cinquantina abbondante di grillini e Monti che non conta un cazzo nemmeno qua

* Scenario: intanto lo shock da botto di Grillo è dieci volte più forte. Questo avviene per tre motivi: a) la maggioranza assoluta della Camera a Grillo, simbolicamente, è una cosa epocale come mai se ne sono viste; b) è chiaro fino dal primo momento che non è pensabile nulla in cui Grillo non abbia piena voce in capitolo; c) il materiale umano messo a disposizione da Grillo ed intorno al quale va costruito tutto è di qualità oltre lo scadente (col premio di maggioranza entrano candidati che in lista erano indietrissimo: se le punte di diamante messe in cima sono i soggetti che si sono visti finora, non oso pensare a che gente sia quella piazzata quindicesima tanto per fare numero). L'obiettivo a quel punto diventa inventarsi un modo per includere Grillo mettendolo al contempo in sicurezza.

* Cosa succede: La prima mossa di Grillo è obbligata: ""Ho vinto io, faccio io il governo alle mie condizioni e chi ci sta ci sta"". A quel punto si apre la riffa del Senato: Grillo + uno a scelta tra Pdl e Pd fa centosessanta e qualcosa, soglia lontana dalla governabilità ma con la quale, seppure a forza, una fiducia la si fa uscire. Il Pdl si sfila subito, Berlusconi chiede di rivotare confidando nell'effetto Grecia (ma sapendo che un giro comunque breve all'opposizione a urlare ""ve l'avevo detto io che erano tutti una manica di comunisti"" non potrà fargli che bene). Il Pd può fare due cose: o accetta le condizioni di Grillo (ma mercati, comunità internazionale e Quirinale sono pronti a tutto pur di impedirlo) oppure cerca di fottere gente in massa a Grillo per spostare la Camera. Problema è che per farlo partendo da centrosinistra + Monti di giuda grillini ne servono un centinaio, e sono troppi. Per abbassare l'asticella serve una base Pd+Pdl+Monti, di modo che una ventina di grillini transumati a quel punto bastano.

Is it incredibly hard to get a scholarship at Sciences Po (do note that I'm an international student from a non-EU, non-US country!)? Can you tell me more about your studies there? The study abroad opportunities? 

If I'm not mistaken, getting a master's or grande ecole diploma is pretty much a prerequisite to apply for jobs in France, right?

No, I definitely was not considering one of those private prepas. I had only heard of Ginette, but I also heard they were good. Well, I don't think I'd have grades to get into one of the better prepas. I only have two Bs and a C at A-Level, and I guess that is like 12/20? Maybe even 10. I don't know.

Different aflatoxins are produced by Aspergillus mold and there is no known practical solution to totally prevent them from all food products. They do appear in various concentrations in cereals, oilseeds, spices, nuts, maize, dried fruit, figs etc. Aflatoxin M appears in diary products when cows eat food contaminated with Aspergillus.

In EU the limit for aflatoxin M1 is 0.050 µg/kg in milk and milk products, and more specifically 0.10 µg/kg for B1 and 0.025 µg/kg for M1 in infant foods. Besides different types of aflatoxins sampling and analytical methods are also important here, and I don't know if they're different in Serbia.

Obviously it's not a good solution to simply change the limit, but it's not too horrible either as it's still very small amounts we're talking about.

&gt;(pretty common among CPGE students) gone through HS without really &gt;working and don't have a method.

Is it true that most prepa teachers have often been to a prepa themselves, and/or they generally have an M2 degree?

I'm afraid I am one of those students. The few youtube videos I saw really scared the hell out of me. Of course ""J'ai rate mines-ponts"" was hilarious. But the rest? Not so much!

So yeah, I am pretty scared that I go back to my poor studying habits. I went through most of high school doing quite well without doing much work, and while I had some other issues (mostly personal stuff) going on, I really had no legitimate excuse. I can't afford to fuck around anymore.

How ""supporting"" can the prepas be? I guess what I really want to know is how does going through a prepa help turn one into a more conscientious student? Is it just a consequence of being in a better environment? I have to say, one of the big reasons why I didn't do too well in high school is because I was so easily bored.

It's the fifth best according to L'Étudiant in B/L ([link](http://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-prepa/premiere-sup-b-l.html)), so if I were you I would consider it. I can recommend some good and relatively easy to access prépas in my region (south-eastern France) if you want, but I don't know where you want to study! Ginette is good but I feel like you can get a good education for so much cheaper.

As far as Sciences Po goes, I am in the [Aix-en-Provence](http://www.sciencespo-aix.fr/fr_FR/) institute and I accessed it through the [concours commun](http://cc.iep.fr/). I entered in first year because I wanted to take my time and did not have any economics knowledge. I could have entered in second year through another concours if I wanted. The system is the same for the six IEPs in the concours commun (Aix, Rennes, Lille, Lyon, Toulouse, Strasbourg). It is different for Grenoble, Bordeaux and is a complete mess for Paris. 

As far as I know, except probably for Sciences Po Paris (which is a whole different story and changes all the time) you cannot get a scolarship from an IEP. But the tuition (except for Paris) is so low (~1,000EUR) it rarely matters. In France in general scolarships are mostly for social reasons (I have one of those). 

Regarding jobs, the market sucks very much right now. Grande écoles still are the best way to get a good job. Masters also have a good employment rate, even though it obviously depends on the field.

Actually, it is quite easy to work in business-related jobs after studying in an ""école d'ingénieurs généralistes"" (well, at least it works for the best ones). Many friends of mine are planning to work as consultants although they only studied engineering subjects.

However I don't think this is a good thing. There are many students who attempt CPGE only because they are good at school and have no idea of what they want to do later. As a result, the topmost ""écoles d'ingénieurs"" have to deal with a massive number of students who don't want to be engineers at all, and end up adding a few business classes. Actually, in many ""école d'ingénieur"", the first year (sometimes the second one too) is the same for every student, and you study only a little bit of everything.

In your case, you already seem to have an idea about what kind of job you want, and what kind of things you want to study. Are you really sure you'd want to wait for at least three more years before being able to chose your path ? If you are very good in scientific subjects, then being admitted into a very good ""école d'ingénieurs"" is possible, if you make it you'll be among the *élites* and you'll be able to do whatever you want, however it's risky. So if you don't feel comfortable about studying science for the next three years, then maybe an ECS class is better. I could be wrong however.

Einkaufen ist ein bisschen langweilig für mich – ich mache liebe einen langen Spaziergang in dem Wald. Wir haben beide Sachen gemacht, und obwohl Berlin toll war, habe ich es auf dem Land mehr gemocht. In der ersten Woche, war das Wetter echt schön. Es hat die ganzen Wochenende nicht geregnet. Wir haben viel gewandert. Jedoch, war die zweite Woche nicht so gut. Es gab ein sehr großes Gewitter, also mussten wir für zwei Tagen in dem Hotel bleiben. Nach dem Gewitter, hat  es jeden Tag geregnet hat. *Danach, gehen wir früh im Großstadt entgescheiden. (not sure about this one, trying to say decided)* (sorry don't know what you are trying to say ;) ) Wirklich, war es etwas trüb. Wir sind nur in einem kleinen Teil von Deutschland gereist und ich mochte mehr sehen. Wir haben in den Ferien wenig unternommen. Im Hotel übernachtend war besonders langweilig. Die Stadt war interessant, aber nicht für mich. Trotzdem, der Urlaub hat mir gut gefallen. Urlaube in dem Wald finde ich sehr entspannend. Ich würde noch einmal zurückkommen, wenn ich Zeit hätte. Jedoch, würde ich bestimmt mehr von Deutschland sehen! Nächtes Jahr, würde ich vielleicht etwas ein bisschen verschieden machen.

Failing that, any random French girl with a cigarette and a book would probably make me feel funny in my pants. (e.g: Melanie Laurent in Inglourious Basterds)

Is Marseille really as dangerous as people say? Could you tell me more about your prepa? I don't know, just general things!

Sidenote: Have you seen La Haine? I loved it.

Why is Paris a complete mess? You make it sound so funny. And Grenoble and Bordeaux? I know someone at Bordeaux, but I think she's just in a regular master's course. 

Ah, I had only checked the prices for the international BA program in the past and they were around 9000 euros! 1000 would be more affordable. 

I spent the last fifteen minutes or so checking out the websites of Aix (IEP), and it would appear that they don't have a separate admissions process for international students. I looked at the ""annales des concours"" for the first year, I probably wouldn't be able to pass the history exam. I never studied any history at school (they don't even teach it here, except at a select few schools), and I only learned a little on my own. I have procrastinated too much!

But having just checked, I see that there is a bibliographie, so maybe after a year of prepa, the concours wouldn't be too bad. That said, I think staying for 2 years at a prepa would be best for me, financially. The internat is so cheap compared to living outside, that I would have to take out an even bigger loan (I will *have* take one for the last 2-3 years, assuming I don't repeat, at an ecole or during a master's at a university).

But as someone who  has never studied history (only some literature, sciences, and math), are there any specific history/geography/politics/culture generale topics that I should be very familiar with before going into a prepa B/L or ECS?

I gave the Sciences Po program a closer look and I think that it sounds almost ideal. The only thing I can complain about, and even THAT is a stretch, is the lack of math! Are there any funding opportunities for the study abroad or internship abroad in the 3rd year? For e.g, if I want to go to Michigan-Ann Arbor, would I have to pay the tuition fees they charge? Or if I want to work at say, a firm in NYC, will I have to pay for my living expenses on my own? If I understood correctly, the 9 month internship is unpaid, right?

You cannot free a country from government that doesn't want to free it without fighting(at least not in reality of interwar Europe). And it was really hard to get independence from Russia and Germany without being conflicted with them. Regarding Lithuania and Czechoslovakia I agree. With Ukraine it wasn't that simple - it was Petlura that failed to deliver. With more luck Ukraine could have been free from USSR between 1921 and 1939.

He also organized conspiracy very well - very few people from his group were jailed, killed, or expelled to Siberia by Russians, and that group was quite active (they even robbed Russian trains transporting tax money, IIRC). Other conspiracies were much worse at this, and many young people went to Siberia because of that.

But he was poor ruler for the times of peace. Not that it was easy country to rule - Poland of that time had borders with USSR and 3rd Reich, territory from 3 vastly different countries that kept it for over a century had to be integrated somehow, there was The Great Crisis going on in the background, country was destroyed in WW1 and in the war with USSR, there were problems with internal conflicts like with Ukrainians, there was quite big illiteracy (but it was changing quickly thanks to great elementary books by Marian Falski).

Day 1 - [Fat Tire Bike Tour](http://fattirebiketours.com/barcelona) Gives you an overview of the whole city to get your bearings. It was A LOT better than I had expected as the tour guides are brilliant. I highly recommend this. Lasts a couple of hours and then we ended up spending the evening drinking with the group.

Day 2 - Morning in the [Boqueria Market](http://www.boqueria.info/), bought all manner of incredible food for a picnic and then wandered over to [Parc de la Ciutadella](http://www.aviewoncities.com/barcelona/parcdelaciutadella.htm) to sit, eat, relax and take in the ambience of this absolutely beautiful park. Then wandered back via Gothic Quarter for some lazy tapas and beers. 

Day 3. - Walked up to [Montjuic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montju%C3%AFc) to take in the views and also have a wander around the olympic park. In the evening we headed to the single greatest restaurant I have ever been to. If you are a foodie, then this is a must, try the tasting menu at [Con Gracia](http://www.congracia.es/e_index.htm)... make sure you get the wine pairings. It's not cheap, but you will never forget it!!!!!!

Day 4 - In the morning, headed to Els Encants flea market to see some of the weird and wonderful things on sale and take in the ambience of it all. Dos de Maig, 177-187, Eixample. Open Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, 9am-6pm. Then head down to the harbour, beach, and las ramblas for another slow and steady tapas grazing session from bar to bar. (But don't ever eat on Las Ramblas, it's not great...the best places are tucked away in nook and crannies in the Gothic Quarter)

Day 5 - Maybe head to Cap de Creu for a day trip to see Cadaqués and Port Lligat for a relaxed more remote seaside vibe away from the city. 

As for places to stay... we're not fans of hotels so we rented an apartment through [Friendly Rentals](http://www.friendlyrentals.com/en/apartments/barcelona/accommodation-1.htm) and they were really great.

*Letztes Jahr bin ich ...; In der ersten Woche war das Wetter ... ; In die Zukunft würde ich ...*.  The rest can be left as an exercise to fix.

Similarly, when you start main clauses with adverbs like *trotzdem, jedoch, danach, usw.*, there is no need (in fact I think it is incorrect) to have a comma following it.

&gt; Jedoch, war die zweite ...; Trotzdem, der Urlaub hat mir gut gefallen.

*Jedoch war die zweite...; Trotzdem hat der Urlaub mir gut gefallen.*  
In the second example above, you had an error in your word order. Since trotzdem occupies the first position of the clause, you need to have the verb follow. My suggestion still seems a little awkward to me using this particular verb. This sounds a little better to me: *Der Urlaub hat mir trotzdem gut gefallen.*

&gt; Im Hotel übernachtend war besonders langweilig. 

This construction seems strange to me. My suggestion: *Es war besonders langweilig, im Hotel zu übernachten.*

&gt; Die Stadt war interessant, aber nicht für mich.

I think the comma is incorrect since there is no subject after *aber*.

Letztes Jahr bin ich mit meiner Familie nach Deutschland gefahren. Es war in den Weihnachtsferien also war es sehr kalt aber wir hatten dennoch viel Spaß. Wir haben uns zwei Wochen dort aufgehalten – meistens auf dem Land, manchmal in der Stadt. Meine Eltern fahren gern in die Städte weil sie mittlerweile ziemlich alt sind. Einkaufen ist ein bisschen langweilig für mich – ich mache lieber einen langen Spaziergang im Wald. Wir haben beide Sachen gemacht und obwohl Berlin toll war, habe ich es auf dem Land mehr gemocht. In der ersten Woche war das Wetter echt schön. Es hat das ganze Wochenende nicht geregnet. Wir sind daher viel gewandert. Jedoch war die zweite Woche nicht so gut. Es gab ein sehr großes Gewitter also mussten wir für zwei Tage in einem Hotel bleiben. Nach dem Gewitter hat es jeden darauffolgenden Tag geregnet. Daher haben wir uns frühzeitig entschieden in die Großstadt zu gehen. Es war tatsächlich den ganzen Tag unangenehm trüb. Wir haben nur einen kleinen Teil von Deutschland bereist und ich würde gern mehr sehen. Wir haben in den Ferien wenig unternommen. Im Hotel übernachten war besonders langweilig. Die Stadt war interessant aber nicht für mich. Trotzdem, der Urlaub hat mir gut gefallen. Urlaube im Wald finde ich sehr entspannend. Ich würde noch einmal zurückkommen wenn ich Zeit hätte und dann gern mehr von Deutschland sehen! Nächtes Jahr würde ich dann vielleicht einige Dinge ein bisschen anders machen. Meine Eltern aber hoffen, dass wir nach China fahren können um die Familie zu besuchen. Es kann dort ziemlich teuer sein aber wir sind nicht regelmäßig drüben.


Das Land selbst ist fantastisch aber ich freue mich wirklich auf die Fahrt, weil ich seit einer langen Zeit sie nicht gesehen habe! (You mean your family? Then it would be: ""aber ich freue mich wirklich sehr auf die Fahrt, weil ich meine Verwandten seit langem nicht gesehen habe.

true,huhuh11,ZZZZZZchatf,Le Chat de Frensoa,"&gt;Is it true that most prepa teachers have often been to a prepa themselves, and/or they generally have an M2 degree?

Most prepa teachers have been through prepa themselves, yes. I guess most of them have gone through ENS after prépa, but it's far from mandatory.

&gt;I'm afraid I am one of those students. The few youtube videos I saw really scared the hell out of me. Of course ""J'ai rate mines-ponts"" was hilarious. But the rest? Not so much! So yeah, I am pretty scared that I go back to my poor studying habits. I went through most of high school doing quite well without doing much work, and while I had some other issues (mostly personal stuff) going on, I really had no legitimate excuse. I can't afford to fuck around anymore.

Everyone going to prépa is pretty much in that case (more or less). I don't know which videos you've seen, but they're usually meant to be scary :p CPGEs can seem quite horrible from the outside, and people inside it like to describe it as horrible, but once you're in there it's actually not that bad.

&gt;How ""supporting"" can the prepas be? I guess what I really want to know is how does going through a prepa help turn one into a more conscientious student? Is it just a consequence of being in a better environment? I have to say, one of the big reasons why I didn't do too well in high school is because I was so easily bored. I guess I won't have that luxury in a prepa!

It depends. I've heard complaints about top prepas from students who had difficulties and they didn't find the teachers supportive enough. I guess it can be the case when they get so many brilliant students every year. The smaller prépas are usually proud to use this ""proximity"" as an argument. And it works best for some students, to be in a friendlier environment for example. It's also sometimes difficult for some people who were top 3 in their HS and suddenly they are in the bottom 3 because you get to compete in your class against other people just as good or better as you.
Once you get into the prepa mindset, working a lot suddenly becomes easier than what it was in HS. With also your own maturity going on, this turns you into someone very effective at what you do (maths, physics, etc). The downside is that it's quite consuming and make you ""suffocate"". That's why in écoles d'ingénieurs a lot of people stop studying all of a sudden. Everything suddenly seems so boring and easy compared to what happened before.

First page, point (3):

&gt;Maximum levels have been established by Council Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87 of 22 December 1987 laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and of feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency ( 2 ), Commission Regulation (Euratom) No 944/89 of 12 April 1989 laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination in minor foodstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency ( 3 ) and Commission Regulation (Euratom) No 770/90 of 29 March 1990 laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency ( 4 ).

Council Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87 of 22 December 1987 is [this one](http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/radioprotection/doc/legislation/873954_en.pdf). The maximum levels are in the annex, they're exactly the ones lawblog mentions. Point (4) renders them applicable according to [Council Decision 87/600/Euratom of 14 December 1987](http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/radioprotection/doc/legislation/87600_en.pdf), exactly as lawblog mentions. No urban myth there.

&gt;There is a contradiction:
 Contrary to your claim the radiation limits were actually tightened as we all know. Perhaps you were unaware of it or for some other reason failed to mention it but it is of substance, don't you agree?

The regulation was in place as early as March 25th, as you can see. Your articles show that the commission announced to adjust them once again two weeks later. I failed to mention it because I did indeed forget about this, but it makes it even worse imho. Basically, they put a regulation into place in order to increase the limits first, and two weeks later they announced to tighten it for safety reasons. Apparently without even mentioning that they had only been increased two weeks earlier for absurd reasons, at least your two articles fail to mention this.

If that's not an intrenet urban myth then let's call it a myth based on a crappy blog post with baseless interpretations. As EU actually tightened the limits.

I failed to mention it because I did indeed forget about this, but it makes it even worse imho. Basically, they put a regulation into place in order to increase the limits first, and two weeks later they announced to tighten it for safety reasons. Apparently without even mentioning that they had only been increased two weeks earlier for absurd reasons, at least your two articles fail to mention this.

Maybe because it was never increased in the first place.

an earlier date, in particular if the list of excluded products
referred to in Article 4 covers all the products fit for human
consumption to which this Regulation applies;
