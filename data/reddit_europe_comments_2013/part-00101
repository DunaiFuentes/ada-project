Mais aujourd'hui, dans nos sociétés occidentales, on ne sait plus ce que ça veut dire de faire la guerre. C'est quelque chose de très lointain, géographiquement comme temporellement. La WWII doit être le dernier conflit armé a avoir touché le sol français et la plupart des gens qui l'ont vécu sont morts maintenant.

Unfortunately you have missed the [Night of Museums in Frankfurt](http://www.nacht-der-museen.de/frankfurt/impressions/ats00000.htm) for this year.

Make sure you connect with the other expats via the [Internations site](http://www.internations.org/). I was hanging out with the crowd once or twice and it was nice.

If you're on Facebook you should join [mainfrankfurt](https://www.facebook.com/mainfrankfurt) as it keeps you in the loop on festivities and has lots of nice pictures.

There are lots of festivities, interesting exhibition or other great things going on in the Rhein-Main region (Frankfurt, Mainz, Wiesbaden, Darmstadt, etc.)

I was born 40km south of Frankfurt and moved here so I am a rare thing: a native/hessian.. ;-)

**EDIT: I recommend the [Museumsuferfest](http://www.frankfurt-tourismus.de/cms/tourismussuite/en/events_trade_fairs_messe_frankfurt/museumsuferfest_muf_frankfurt.html), not the Mainuferfest. I actually don't like the Mainuferfest so that's a bit embarrassing...**

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; My response is going to have to be short as I am in work. Sorry in advance if I don't answer all of your questions.

No problem, the same with me too.

&gt; De Grauwe's article in the link describes more aggregate demand as stabilising the system, not just from the core countries but also from investment projects and the European Investment bank. My point was that stabilising the system would help these countries oversee their structural reform.

What investment projects? The problem in Spain especially has been that the public sector has been unable to actually conduct any infrastructure and investment projects that would have been profitable. How many new motorways and airports do we need to build?

The big problem that I have with this article and the discussion in general is that people hide away behind abstractions. It is easy to say that we need to increase aggregate demand, but it is whole another business to actually come up with examples on what actually will be done because then real critique against the idea is put out.

&gt; As for your remarks olive oil and apartments, I'm afraid to say I found them a little patronising. It is important to remember that the export sectors in countries do have industrial bases that would be helped if there was more aggregate demand. Have a look at these tables of exports from Ireland, Spain and Italy and you'll see pharmaceuticals as well as machinery. In my country anyway, Italian sports cars are still a luxury item that people are willing to pay a lot of money for.

Well, where else are you going to get growth? For example Spanish export industries have been in full swing for quite some time. The problem in Spain is that you have lots of people and companies that for the last decade committed themselves to build new apartments. You can't just take these people and put them to work with exports because A) industrial production doesn't increase just by putting more people to work with them, you actually have to build new production capacity and that takes time; B) the skills may not be what is actually needed at all.

&gt; Finally, An unemployment fund wouldn't necessarily entail transfers of wealth from the core to the periphery. If the unemployment fund kicked in when a country's unemployment rate reached 10% for example, then it could potentially assist any Eurozone member state. In Germany, unemployment has been over 10% twice in the last twenty years, so conceivably it would be eligible for assistance if such a fund were put in place.

That isn't good enough answer. Even if we make assumption that real unemployment on all Eurozone countries is the same in long term, then we have still problems such as corruption and controlling distribution of unemployment benefits. For example in Greece large amounts of people have scammed the state for decades, not to mention that many of those 27% of unemployed in Spain are actually working. If there is going to be common unemployment fund, then there needs to be common social and unemployment services; common social and labor legislation; common federal investigation to crack down on corruption. I'm afraid that the only way to tackle for example corruption is to throw any public employe caught from corruption to mandatory jail time. Not to mention that people and employers caught scamming the state also need to put into prison too.

The problem doing anything that starts with the word common is that there is very little truest, do I truest Italian authorities? Or the Spanish ones... Hell no. And the only way to increase my truest to the system is that the system starts to harshly punish any one that crosses is over.

Like in every domain in France, the word ""Money"" is a dirty word. You don't do things for money, you do it for higher pursuits, ""for the sake of art""

You have to see french cinema as a quasi ""Royal industry"" in a sense that they are here to entertain the King and the King's court (aka the intellectuals), and not the dumb plebs. Making successful movies isn't relevant, it is better if you movie is successful but the only thing that matter is the movie must be artistic &amp; deep

And when a movie is very successful, it is sometimes irrationally hated by the whole industry, like Bienvenue chez les Chtis
 
The whole trade, actors &amp; producers &amp; scenarist usually don't give a shit if the movie they are producing are horrendous and that nobody will watch them, because they have already been fully paid BEFORE the movie is made. At least 60% of the costs are financed by TVs channels who pre-orders the movies, and by public funding.
There is no financial incentive to produce neither good or profitable movie.

As a result, 95% of French cinema is utter shit and the more obscure, deep and tortured the movie is, the more the film maker will be praised. 
Random examples: L'absence, Potiche, l'Amour c'est mieux a deux, les petits mouchoirs, etc...
A gigantic circlejerking industry is the results, and all that is financed by public taxes.

But, and that is what is great about the french ""exeption culturelle"", the 5% who actually give a shit about art and quality produce true masterpieces. They don't have to care much about money, and can focus on quality: Intouchables, Un prophete &amp; all audiard, havanavicus movies...

Over the last decades, Europe has developed a set of social mechanisms and legal axioms to curb nationalism and hate which led to WW2. For decades, we have brainwashed our children with notions that everybody is equal, that borders are bad and divisive and that everybody should be free to practice his religion.

BUT. All of these laws, mechanisms and axioms have been devised with Europeans and European problems in mind, because intraeuropean conflicts were the primary cause of the world wars. The worst imaginable enemies were nationalism and communism, the policy makers simply didnt have a known case of totalitarianism sneaking in through the religion route, so no protections were built to prevent this. Since the only religions existing were Christianity and a few Jews, the ""freedom of religion"" essentially considered just different forms of Christianity. Something like totalitarian Islam was simply not on the radar and the future immigration of millions and millions of Muslims not a realistic threat to protect against.

So even though now everybody KNOWS what the problem is and how it could EASILY be solved, it is hard to tackle it directly without throwing out half of the principles and guaranteed human rights put into place to prevent a future WW2.

Los ingresos procedentes de las privatizaciones contribuyeron a reducir rápidamente la deuda pública del 68 al 63%.*

true,CountVonTroll,null,null,"As phessler said, [EC cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cash) are quite common. In supermarkets, clothing stores etc., they'll be pretty much universally accepted. Even though many restaurants accept them, in anything gastronomy it's common to pay cash. You absolutely need cash for street food and other small purchases.

Pretty much any cashing account at a German bank will come with an EC card. You'll want a credit card as well (for online purchases and travel), by default the balance will be automatically payed from your cashing account at the end of the month.

*Some* supermarket chains (e.g., REWE) have introduced cash withdrawal at the register if you shop for €20 or more, but you'll still need ATMs. Banks have pooled their ATM networks into groups. Fees can be quite hefty if you withdraw cash from the ""wrong"" pool, so you may want to keep ATM locations in mind when you choose a bank (i.e., an ATM somewhere near where you will be often, anyway). There's [Cash Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_Group), [CashPool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CashPool), the [Sparkassen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkasse#Sparkassen) and [Volksbanken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankcard-Servicenetz). Some online banks, like ING DiBa and DKB, have free accounts with free credit cards that let you withdraw cash without fees, globally.  
Make sure your bank has an English online banking interface, as you will be using it *a lot*. You'll hardly ever have to physically go to your bank. It's common to set up automatic direct deposit for regular payments like rent, and for regular payments of varying amounts (e.g., phone bill), you'll just authorize the company to withdraw it from your cashing account. The last time I've seen a paper check in Germany was about twenty years ago, and it already was a rarity then.

One more thing that is entirely unrelated: A 7 that is hand written the American way will look like a 1 to Germans. So, if your address contains a 7, make sure anyone who wants to send you a letter or package from the US crosses it they way your German postman expects, or it might take forever to find its way to you. This really shouldn't be an issue, but I've heard that it can be.

While I'm at the topic of packages, you can buy English books at Amazon.de and Buch.de. Shipping fees aside, the UK is in the EU so you can order from British online stores as well, without having to pay any taxes or duties. If you order from the US, Japan or generally outside the EU, you'll have to pay VAT (19%, for food and books only 7%) if the value is more than €22 (gifts: €45). If the value exceeds €150, you'll have to pay duties.",0,1369222039,null,0,false,0,ca3o3zt,t3_1eti1h,t1_ca3o3zt,t1_ca3mgsl,null,1431073443,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Now, I'm not completely familiar with Swedish law, but if both locals and immigrants feel discriminated against, then something is going wrong. In my opinion, a successful multicultural society requires:

* Laws being enforced consistently and equally to every citizen. This includes (among many other things) not punishing local hate speech more harshly than immigrant hate speech, but also making sure that immigrants are treated equally by the police and juries (I understand the current claims by these youths may be unsubstantiated, but it wouldn't be unrealistic to think that there's some level of difference, specially when there's a general climate of confrontation).

* Those parts of incoming cultures that are incompatible with the local society should be already covered by law in a general way. From here just apply the previous point, enforcing those laws consistently and, most importantly, not extending the blame to individuals who have done nothing.

* The rest of the incoming cultural traits which are compatible with a society (as in, they allow coexistence without stepping on anyone's basic rights) should be left alone. This is something that should be clear to both locals and immigrants: if laws are respected, further integration is a choice of the individual. Trying to force integration is often counter-productive, and makes people who aren't hurting anyone feel attacked.

Right now both local majorities and some immigrant minorities have a strong sentiment of identification with their collective, but also tend to define themselves in contrast to the other collective, and this causes prejudice; whenever someone in the other part does something bad, it's somehow assumed that their whole group is to blame. This is the feeling that we should try to get rid of with time: we should be aware of our roots, but also of our individuality and other people's individuality.

true,PreviousNickStolen,null,null,"I dont know how to explain this, but this is a classic case of what we in sweden calls ""soss-tant"" (using this word, will net me 10 downvotes alone, lol).

Basically, we have a huge state budget due to our ridiculous taxes, which disperses money to ""worthy"" and ""human"" issues. Left-leaning people (in the socialist/communist way) are dragged like flies to these kinds of jobs. They often pay a bit less than a private sector job, but comes with less responsibility and a higher job security. 

These people, are most likely people without a engineering or technical degree, they are more often than not women. They often have a ""soft"" degree in sociology or literature or political science/history.

The only thing this group of people love more than looking like they are helping others, are blaming the rest of us for not helping enough. This is a clear-cut such situation, where the cultural and social problems are blamed om racism, because racism is evil (tm) and a superb tool to belittle your political opponents. 

You also have to realize that in sweden, racism isn't only percepted as people that hate others because they have another skin colour.

Racism would be:

* Not hiring someone who doesnt speak swedish well enough.
* Not agreeing to the current immigration policys (like allowing obviously lying young afghan men as minors so they later can bring their whole families). Doing what norway does with dental checks would be racist.
* Not accepting that the immigrants have no defined age since they destroy their passports (it would be almost impossible to get here without one, yet they have none when they arrive at our side of the border), which means they can get away with crimes because they are officially underage.
* Voting for a party that is clearly defined as non racist, or even defending them in this way. (I am not a voter for them btw, I just find this very curious).
* Telling a coloured person they cannot have entrance to a club because they have the wrong clothes.
* Telling a coloured person they cannot be at a specific private place.
* Basically everything that involves a non white person and something negative (a person that refused to shake a female boss's hand at a hiring interview was awarded 3k5 euro as a compensation because he didnt get the job).
* Saying the above things.

I grew up believing this actually was racism, but I have later come to realize that racism isn't what swedes in general believe it to be. I would rather call it a socioeconomic and perhaps cultural problem.

A big thing this article misses is the economic disparity in the swedish system. On one hand we have educated swedes making decent money and living a good life thanks to our welfare system. On the other hand we have the recipients of their tax money scraping by in run down suburbs that have long been abandon by native swedes. As usual these left-leaning people will advocate more taxes, more redistribution of wealth, when the real problem is the schools, the environment we place immigrants in, the non existing redefining of their expectancy of what sweden is like. 

Even if some would argue that our immigrants can have a good life and a nice possibility to education, a job, a life. There is a big difference between a middle class swede and a somali that have both lived in sweden their entire lifes. The swede would have a well paying job at 25, the somali might very well speak in broken swedish and not even have a secondary education completed. Not for lack of chances, thats just the way it is. There is no easy fix, no explanation to be had. You cant throw more money at this problem to fix it. 

This article, simplifies all these aspects of swedish society and its problems down to ""racism"". Which isnt only stupid, its also dangerous. It's the same kind of rhetoric that made our political parties refuse to speak about immigration to the far right party for 2-3 years (until they realized they were losing voters because of it).

To many swedes, even arguing against this article would classify me as ""racist"" because I dared to voice my disagreement against this obvious nice, fair and good organization that only wants to help the most exploited in society. 

I dont think that is the right attitude to have in this issue. I also realize this post reads like a argument for less immigration, and against immigrants. It's not.

Of course not all countries are the same but I think what those pro austerity are nowadays mainly thinking is: What is your plan then? Increasing debt till it's impossible to get out of? With shared debt and all that comes with it, spending to get out of this recession is definitely a good possibility. But as it stands at the moment it is not for  a lot of countries. Definitely for countries like Greece. They don't have the money to spend and can't get loans at bearable rates without taking measures to reduce debt to cover those.

Also the fact that those (now very troubling) debts appeared indicates structural problems. Something was wrong otherwise you wouldn't be accumulating debt endlessly. You can ignore it now but then it'll just continue to heap up and future generations will have to deal with it or continue to ignore it until everything collapses.

Somebody mentioned that governments should tackle these problems and reduce debt when the countries are healthy. That is indeed a fair point but I repeat. It's rather hard to spend your way out of a downward slope when the debt generated by said spending is what makes the slope go down.

Io non penso si possa definire complotto,ma interessi.
In teoria gli interessi esistono dappertutto ma qui potrebbe esserci un delicato problema di finanza etica non di procedure sbagliate,in teoria.
Comunque come ho detto la faccenda è complessa.poi ognuno la pensi come vuole,ovviamente.

Stampare moneta all'accorrenza.

&gt;Io parto da una posizione neutra e poi mi faccio la mia personale idea non neutra.Non voglio convincere nessuno a pensare qualcosa in particolare,ma a esaminare bene i punti di vista si.Le conclusioni poi saranno personali.

&gt;è un po' come dire che non sai come si curano i tumori, e visto che qualcuno dice con la chemioterapia, altri con le erbe di Bach (o chi per esse), allora non posso esprimermi. in base a cosa decidi come curarti? tiri la moneta? ti informi meglio? come, studiando medicina? oppure fai affidamento a qualcuno? questo qualcuno, medico o omeopata?

Non dico che bisogna essere fini intenditori per avere un opinione ma dico che se non si è fini intenditori di non saltare alle conclusioni veloci.Un conto è avere un opinione,un conto è credere di avere la verità(che richiede tempo).
Se hai un opinione presentala come tale e non come verità,e soprattutto sostienila come opinione e non come verità.

Se non sapessi nulla di tumori e ci fossero due gruppi a dirmi come curarmi proverei a usare il mio cervello per approfondire finchè posso.Soprattutto se ho un tumore sti cazzi mi leggo tutti i manuali lol.
Informarsi comprende anche ascoltare i diversi punti di vista,valutare quanti successi/insuccessi hanno avuto le diverse terapie(e qui si vede perchè il tuo esempio è sbagliato,semplicemente perchè si parla di tutt'altro lol).

Riassumendo:inizialmente non posso esprimermi se davvero non so nulla.

I can't really comment on Austrians. The reason being that Austrians and German-Swiss have some base-line hatred for Germans. So my views, pretty much like most Germans, will be somewhat skewed.
I'm on friendly terms with lots of Austrians but those tend to be on the educated, world friendly side. 
My experience is though that there seems to be a lot less tolerance towards foreigners than in Western Germany so that initial gap (in making an aquaintance) might just be a little bit harder to overcome.

Solo che mi son trovata a fare questo discorso anche con mia madre, che riteneva negativo che da lui si pecepisse questa ambizione.

Perdonami se mi rifaccio ancora al modello americano, ma essendo una enorme democrazia molto basata sulla comunicazione, mi sembra un buon elemento di comparazione.

Per me, nemmeno l'ambizione é un male in sé. Il senatore o il governatore medio americano trasuda ambizione. Da tutti i pori. Questo perché in America ambizione é sinonimo di ""voglia di fare"". E un politico che ""fa"", fa per il cittadino. Ma se questo governatore rimette in sesto il mio stato, le strade son sicure, adottiamo energia pulita e tutti hanno un lavoro, che mi frega se sembra ambizioso?Anzi, se questo era l'obbiettivo dell'ambizione, ben venga. Che faccia risplendere tutti i suoi bei denti sbiancati a piú non posso!

Credo sia una cosa molto italiana pretendere un'umiltá di facciata. E' solo che non capisco dove sia la positivitá intrinseca di tale umiltá comunicata all'elettorato, se poi l'umile in questione é un testardo anziano che non ascolta nemmeno un esperto di quelli che ha intorno.

Preferisco genuina ambizione, ovviamente con buoni obbiettivi politici e ancora migliori risultati, che un finto umile vecchio stampo che non ottiene molto e alla fine non riesce nemmeno a comunicare ció che di buono ha fatto, riconsegnando l'Italia ad un miglior comunicatore, che peró ha magari motivazioni ben peggiori.

Un buon comunicatore ambizioso ma con buone idee é molto raro. Se Renzi cosí fosse (e ripeto, non lo so e per ora non ne ho alcuna prova), sarebbe stupido lasciarselo scappare.",0,1369225947,null,0,false,0,ca3oszt,t3_1erpw5,t1_ca3oszt,t1_ca3nt5b,null,1431073116,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

There are four physical networks. In order of coverage and cost: T-mobile (not the underdog ""uncarrier"", but the evil former state monopoly), Vodafone, O2 (the former Spanish state monopoly) and e-plus (the former Dutch monopoly, this time). With the exception of Vodafone, they all have a ""budget"" brand, respectively those are Congstar, Fonic and Base. On top of that there's a plethora (seriously) of virtual networks (e.g., Blau.de, then some by the discount supermarkets, coffee roasters, anything -- maybe you'll want to start your own, it seems to be easy), most of them run on e-plus' physical one and use a similar pricing scheme, but can vary significantly for calls to the US (9c/minute is something like a standard, though). Receiving calls is always free.  
You *can* get a subsidized phone on a two year contract, if you want, but I recommend a prepaid contract instead. Congstar is quite OK for mobile data these days, considering the better coverage than the e-plus based ones, despite the T-mobile affiliation. You'll be able to transfer your number easily when the situation changes.

Home Internet:

If you thought the number of mobile plans was confusing, you haven't seen anything yet (here's a German word for you: *Tarifdschungel* -- ""tariff jungle""). Use a [search engine](http://tarifrechner.heise.de/dsl.php) and ask around at work. Same for electricity and gas.

You'll probably want to travel. Frankfurt is the main transport hub, so you'll be well connected. You may want to consider getting a [BahnCard](http://www.bahn.de/i/view/DEU/en/prices/germany/bahncard.shtml), just be aware it's a subscription, so cancel it in time.  
Train tickets are cheaper if you book them early (at least three days, up to 90), but then you'll be tied to a specific connection. The earlier you book, the cheaper it is. This doesn't just work inside Germany, you can get a ticket to e.g., Paris for €40 each way (takes four hours).

Not entirely true. Islam has been a ""European"" religion for centuries, for example in Spain, Ukraine, and the Balkans. Until the 19th century a large part of Europe was under Ottoman rule.

The problem is not Islam as such, but rather the countries the immigrants are coming from (or their parents came from) - a laundry list of failed states such as Pakistan, Somalia, and Afghanistan, suffering from civil war, tribalism and lunatic brands of Islam such as Wahabism (financed by Saudi Arabia but finding a ready audience from a traumatized and ignorant population).

Why Sweden is taking in such immigrants is unfathomable. Nations such as France and the UK still maintain close relations with former colonies and have long cultural ties, plus a certain amount of guilt over centuries of colonial oppression. Sweden however is blameless (well, in so far as their empire never extended outside northern Europe). One may expect taking immigrants with skills Sweden needs such as doctors and engineers, and some genuine political asylum seekers. But filling entire neighbourhoods with these kinds of immigrants - unskilled, radicalized and traumatized through war - is just suicidal.

But I am confident that we could gain a lot if more people focused on talking about how individuals can deal with discrimination in real life, rather than simply raging against it. The beauty of modern societies such as Sweden's is that you can find a way to climb up the social ladder - despite the obstacles.""

Nima Sanandaji is a Swedish writer of Kurdish origin. He has a PhD in polymer technology and has written numerous books and reports about subjects such as integration, entrepreneurship, and women's career opportunities.

more:  ""I grew up in various tough neighbourhoods of Sweden, dependent on welfare. In this environment, racism was hard to avoid. When I started seventh grade most boys in my class were outspoken neo-Nazis. I remember feeling that Sweden was fraught with discrimination. Luckily, I was wrong. When I went to university and started climbing the social ladder, I realized that the majority of Swedes are not racists. In fact, many are more than happy to encourage immigrants who want to succeed.""

The popular narrative from the left (which you may or may not agree with) is that Muslims are trapped in a spiral: they do not feel that they are included in their new homelands, and create insular communities as a way of dealing with that, which in turn ostracises them further from the mainstream society, which tightens the bonds in the insular communities, etc. In this scenario both mainstream society and the Muslim communities are to blame for tensions between them.

You can find these characteristics easily anywhere in the world. 

My point is that many parts of Europe are still ""there"", culturally. Thus, very few can claim to be totally incompatible with these immigrants.

Sweden is among those few, in a very unlucky way. It is a society based on trust, at every level. To start a process of integration, you have first to aknowledge to be different, to then pass to identify if there are any anti-social behaviour which lead to illegal activities, and then act to curb on those. You have to teach those rules, support language courses to be sure evrybody understands, and create a net of support to monitor progress. It takes money, and it takes time, especially if you are not ready to wait forever to get results. But for step two, mentality, you need decades, and several of them.

We had a movie in the 80s in Italy called ""Volevo i pantaloni"" (""I wanted trousers"").

If you count neither the unaccounted external costs nor the lavish subsidies received by the nuclear industry. It started during WW2, and it never ended.

&gt;much less so when you take into consideration costs associated with strengthening power distribution networks.

? Solar thermal functions similar to small fossil or very small nuclear plants if you use it to generate electricity. Which means the distribution has exactly the same problems and benefits. Except that solar thermal is smaller, cheaper and requires less safety measures than nuclear or fossil fuels so you can spread them out to better adapt to the spread of demand.

&gt;Much better idea would be to issue permits to let private companies build new nuclear plants to Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland and Greece.

No private company has ever built a nuclear plant without huge subsidies, nor will it ever. Even if they would, what do you expect to happen when a nuclear company is confronted with a problem in the future that requires large expenditures? They'll go bankrupt. Who'll get to clean up the mess? Right. They're better than you at that game.

If you really like private investment, you would favor renewables: those are within reach of small businesses and private investors, and don't require big capital outlays that can only be funded by big corporations or governments.

I have been living outside of Europe for almost 15 years and always try to become part of the country I live in, learn the language, make local friends. Without expecting my host country's government to give me any free stuff to do so.

There is a large group of immigrants in Europe that has adapted very well to life in their new home countries, even while maintaining some aspects of their original culture. But, unfortunately, there is also a large group of immigrants who come to Europe and seem to want everything for free.

I have met a number of these people here in Africa. Even here, people complained to me that Europe should give them more free stuff, and proudly tell me stories about their relatives who made it to Europe illegally and now get free money from the government for the rest of their lives.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; If you count neither the unaccounted external costs nor the lavish subsidies received by the nuclear industry. It started during WW2, and it never ended.

And how much I as Finnish taxpayer have paid for that? Nothing. And my parents generation? Nothing. And my grand parents generation? Nothing.

&gt; ? Solar thermal functions similar to small fossil or very small nuclear plants if you use it to generate electricity. Which means the distribution has exactly the same problems and benefits. Except that solar thermal is smaller, cheaper and requires less safety measures than nuclear or fossil fuels so you can spread them out to better adapt to the spread of demand.

And that is why energy companies are investing billions after billions to build solar thermal plants... Oh, but they aren't, and they aren't because it is not profitable.

&gt; No private company has ever built a nuclear plant without huge subsidies, nor will it ever. Even if they would, what do you expect to happen when a nuclear company is confronted with a problem in the future that requires large expenditures? They'll go bankrupt. Who'll get to clean up the mess? Right. They're better than you at that game.

Finnish energy producer [Teollisuuden Voima](http://www.tvo.fi/Home) would like to have talk with you. The company was founded in 1969 by Finnish industrial companies to provide them with cheap nuclear energy. Their first nuclear reactor became online in 1978 and the second in 1980. They are currently finishing the construction of third plant, and are currently designing their fourth. They have been completely funded by Finnish companies, and they have always been profitable. So yes, private companies can build and operate easily nuclear plants profitably.

&gt; Even if they would, what do you expect to happen when a nuclear company is confronted with a problem in the future that requires large expenditures? They'll go bankrupt. Who'll get to clean up the mess? Right. They're better than you at that game.

In Finland nuclear companies contribute to two funds, to one fund that is to be used to decommission and dismantle the power plants after they have been stopped, and another one to dispose nuclear waste.

&gt; If you really like private investment, you would favor renewables: those are within reach of small businesses and private investors, and don't require big capital outlays that can only be funded by big corporations or governments.

No. There is no point on favoring small businesses or small investors. If a big corporation can do somethings more efficiently and cost-effectively then they should be the ones doing it. Tampering the functioning of the market by for example favoring small businesses will only distort the market and make it more inefficient.

&gt; The first line was just opened a few months ago, let's hold our horses shall we? Now the airports, those will almost certainly be wasted...

And the immense profits of these new lines can be used to build future lines... Yeah..... Probably not.

See? Much, much better. You just called *them* -- **rioters**. Because that is what they are. Rioters. They might also be Muslim. Or Christian. Or whatever.

I don't give much about the ""natives"" vs ""non-natives"" thingy. Too complicated. Because in ideology, the islamists, rioters and racists are actually closer to each other than to most of the people I would call friends that have ""European values"". Just call them idiots. Either way you have to concede that most people here on Reddit that spout racists shit are just armchair fascists. They are not ""native Swedes"" that are sad or angry about ""their country"". They are from Portugal, Bulgaria or England for that matter. And they have nothing to do with that particular incident. Even if they are Swedish chances are low they live in these parts.

I may have used the wrong word in my initial statement though. In the US, the perception(IMO) is that the country is superior, but not that the people inside of it are inherently superior. We lack a common biological makeup, so *if* you deem us superior you can't tie it to anything inherent. It's how all the pieces come together, not the pieces themselves.

I agree with you there. Zemmour's opinion is that we've seen the destruction of what was the French People by individualism and political [clientelism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clientelism).

Not a matter of blood, but a matter of ideals and heart. When my parents grew up, people were French before being something else (Jewish, Muslim, Basque etc.) and even before being individuals. We know French ideals, we have a Constitution, but the European Constitution treaty was refused by the French. IMHO that alone allows to say that there is no European People, but that there is a French People.

Lastly, here are some extracts from the Constitution :

**Préambule**

Le peuple français proclame solennellement son attachement aux Droits de l’Homme et aux principes de la souveraineté nationale.

**Article 1**

La France est une République indivisible, laïque, démocratique et sociale. Elle assure l’égalité devant la loi de tous les citoyens sans distinction d’origine, de race ou de religion. Elle respecte toutes les croyances. Son organisation est décentralisée.

true,miramarco,lurker,,"I just noticed your edit (it wasn't delivered by orangered). What the other people said is true, but I'll explain a bit.

You take your ticket and insert its shorter edge into the machine. When you hear a noise, the machine should have punctured a hole and printed date and name of your station on it, [like this](http://trenoregionale.altervista.org/images/biglietto26.jpg) or [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aWmFsAHg4_s/TKUVC10P_hI/AAAAAAAAAFs/KSdPbRUHfe8/s1600/FS+billete+Roma-Viterbo+12.12.2007.jpg). (The ones I linked to are both valid for regionale and regionale veloce only. You can see that no specific seat is booked, and they *must* be stamped. The first one is valid for any 30-km route by rail, starting from the Piemonte region; the second one is valid from Roma to Viterbo through Orte, but not for other routes.)

Tickets for national trains (i.e. *not* regionale or regionale veloce) do not need to be stamped. If you are given a ticket like [this](http://comesiviaggia.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/rimborso-trenitalia.jpg) (notice: in this example two seats are booked, no. 95 and 96 on the 2nd car of the train. *This ticket is valid for one train only!*), you do not need to stamp your ticket (but it doesn't hurt). If you book through Trenitalia's website, print your receipt and hand it to the ticket inspector.

I was almost forgetting: Seat numbering on Trenitalia's trains is fucked up. IIRC, the odd ones and the even ones are on the two sides of the corridor. So you'd think that two consecutive numbers are next to each other on a train – they're not. Protip: It's easier to convince other passengers to switch seats than trying to get the right seats while booking.

One last thing: You also need to stamp your bus tickets, but you have to do it on the bus. You'll find the machine on the bus after boarding (some cities switched to RFID readers).

If you have other questions, feel free to ask.

Mais on mettra combien de temps à faire ce diagnostic ? Dans combien de cas ça se finit également comme ça (avec un beau parachute doré après des années de salaires élevé) ? Les actionnaires vont rarement admettre de s'être aussi royalement planté.

&gt; Bah je sais pas, tu monterais dans un avion où le pilote à 100 heures de vols contre un autre où le pilote a 1000 heures de vols?

Le truc, c'est que là on a des données. On sait au bout de combien d'heures de vols un pilote a l'expérience nécessaire pour gérer des accidents de façon compétente. Mais dans le cadre des PDGs, c'est le flou total. Est ce qu'un PDG qui a dirigé Danone pendant 10 ans va mieux savoir gérer par exemple Intel que le mec qui a été au board d'Intel depuis 20 ans et qui aime cette boite, qui est prêt à garder le même salaire pour faire à peu près ce qu'il faisait mais avec plus de responsabilités ? 

On parle pas de gens qui ont zéro expérience et qu'on a pris dans la rue, on parle de mettre à ce poste des gens qui connaissent très bien la boite et pas très bien le poste. 

Tu monterais dans un avion dont le pilote n'a jamais piloté ce modèle ni même ce type d'avion mais t'assure que c'est pareil et que ses 1000 heures de vol valent mieux que les 100 de son copilote qui lui les a fait sur ce modèle ?

&gt; les méchant vicieux pleins de frics mais pleins d'experiences qui pourraient souver pas mal de boîte, bah ils vont pas chercher à prendre un poste en France.

Sérieusement, bon débarras. Un patron non-éthique d'un grand groupe, même si on accepte l'hypothèse que le cynisme et l'exploitation des employés sont des vertus économiques, aura un effet tout simplement néfaste sur la politique en France. ""La proximité de la politique et des milieux d'affaire"" comme on dit  avec euphémisme dans les médias, désigne tout simplement plusieurs formes de corruptions, plus ou moins directes, plus ou moins passives, de chantage au chômage, de pression et de lobbying, qui sont un réel problème en démocratie.

On n'est déjà plus dans un système capitaliste ou dans un marché libre. On a un état, plus ou moins corrompu, qui édicte des règles. Si la majorité de tes patrons ne sont pas éthiques, croient que tant qu'on gagne de l'argent c'est qu'on améliore la société, vont participer à cette corruption. Imposer un salaire max (ou ma préférence : un écart max des salaires dans l'entreprise : on laisse la liberté de gagner beaucoup mais pas sur le dos des employés) ferait un bon filtre pour toute une catégorie de pourris.

Après, dans l'absolu et dans la théorie, je suis d'accord pour dire que le salaire devrait être libre et pas limité.

La deuxième partie de cette citation est une énorme bêtise, et j'ai des doutes sur la manière dont l'apprentissage d'une langue à la crèche va être géré en France.

Le développement linguistique chez les enfants en bas âge est tel qu'il faut engager des natifs qui doivent parler aux enfants uniquement dans un anglais parfait afin qu'il grandissent dans un environnement totalement bilingue. Idéalement, il faut aller chercher les instits dans les pays anglo-saxons. Mais comme on est en France, ça ne se fera jamais comme ça. L'idée en soi est très bonne, et je la supporte à 100% mais son exécution doit être bien réfléchie. Il y a de multiples études sur le développement linguistique des enfants bilingues, et il est temps qu'on s'en serve pour faire les bons choix quand à l'enseignement des langues en France.

De plus, étant issu d'une école européenne, je peux dire avec certitude qu'avoir des cours d'histoire-géo, physique, et informatique dans une langue étrangère à partir de mes 13 ans a boosté mon apprentissage de manière significative. Une langue ne s'apprend pas seulement avec des listes de vocabulaire et de la conjugaison, et il faut la pratiquer autrement qu'en parlant de ses vacances d'été avec un prof non-natif.

I don't actually know how the primary dealer system works in Europe, the trouble is that European central banks (with the obvious exemption of the BoE) don't have nearly the same freedom that the Fed does. You can see that in Spain where the Spanish Central Bankers were begging for an interest hike from as early as 2005 (and also a dose of inflation) to slow down debt accumalation in the private sector. 

There are a couple of other problems: the markets by and large trust the United State, they don't trust the Spanish, Greeks or Italians. Even a cursory glance at their financial history up until 1992 will show why. The European statewide banks can't engage in QE without authorisation from the ECB (and that they are not allowed to legally has been conveinantly ignored), the Germans have a societal and political aversion to inflation (the Euro covers a huge range of unintegrated cultures and financial settings) and the dollar is a reserve currency. In the US, if Florida was in complete crisis, the central government would be forced to step in. Spain is in complete crisis, but it is very hard for a German politicians (even if they wanted to) to justify spending German taxpayer's cash on a resdistributive policy in Spain. 

The final problem is that these countries are thought of so badly that they are still in crisis after the ECB hasn't just underwritten, but actually physically bought bonds from the troubled economies.

But, legal realities aside, still we have a different attitude towards free speech in Europe in that hate speech tends to also get censored by law, next to copyright infringement, certain types of pornography and personal defamation that are censored both in the US and in Europe. 

We are not so different, when it comes to censorship. But we do censor more.

Anyway, of course it helps if you are somewhat sober, more observant than at least one other nearby person, look local-ish, and put away your belongings in the ""best"" places on your body or in your clothes.

The Eurozone national banks are still central banks in the sense that they find the government money. That was always considered the only role of a bank in Spain and France. The Neatherlands bank was basically the Bundesbank light, the Bundesbank was the politicians bane and probably the only proper typology of a central bank. It still has massive influence over internal financial policy because it is the only bank that can still afford to sell or issue debt without subsidy from the ECB. 

I think there are three solutions. 

1) Eurobonds - but try selling that to the northern european countries who'll have to buy them. This is Germany we're talking about, the past 50 years, in every aspect of diplomacy they have talked the talk until it negatively affected their interests in some way. 

2) A new deutschmark - essentially you let the northern european countries completely set the terms of the euro. You get a strong, stable currency which would completely fuck the southern european economies. On the other hand, it would probably be easier to sell the wealth-relocations needed to a sceptical public. What would happen is that you'd see a Montenegro type situation (Deutschmark/Euro but no direct involvment in either) . Montenegro is hardly the paradigm of economic aptitude or success though. 

3) The re-introduction of old currencies. It would be completely catastrophic but then phoenixs and ashes and all that.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"You are absolutely correct, the vast majority of Wehrmacht losses took place on the eastern front, a factor of 5-1 more than on the Western. Forgetting the Soviet march on Berlin, even that in itself shows the USSR's role as decisive in the war. I would never contest that it wasn't, and it's good that in the last 10 years Russia and it's former orbit is starting to gain the credit it deserves in the western mindset.

However to say that 'Hitler was put down by the Russians', as if other actors were not *also* decisive is reductive and patently incorrect. Russian victory was not certain, at least not until well into 1943, and it's only on reddit that you'd ever see such an argument advanced.

Don't take my word for it, take General Zhukov's, the guy who more than anyone was responsible for the USSR surviving 1941/42 and being in a position to launch a counter-offensive. He stated that by October 1941 ""our troops on the Mozhaiks defense line could not have stopped the enemy if he moved on Moscow"" and ""It would have been possible to contain the initial units of the opponent but if he quickly sent in his main group, he would have been difficult to stop"". Fortunately for Moscow at that time the Wehrmacht had somewhat split their force, plus the advent of the mother of all winters more than helped.

Russia in 1941/42 was in a terrible state, but managed to weather the Nazi attempts and of course by 1943 began their counter-offensive. However a key reason for Russia being able to keep on fighting were the Arctic Convoys and Persian Corridor, by which the USA alone sent over 16 million tonnes of food and weaponry to keep the USSR in the war. Leningrad itself would likely have fallen without the allies in the British, Canadian and US navies providing it with food and weaponry via Murmansk. By getting through until the second half of the war, when Soviet industry had been successfully moved and got under full head of steam again (it had reduced by half as 2/3 of Soviet industrial capacity was overtaken by the German advance), the USSR was in a much stronger position and became more than self sufficient.

Germany also suffered from being unable to direct all resources to the Eastern front, having to still fight the British, Free French and others in North Africa, and still having to keep a force of several million in France, Benelux, Norway etc. to prevent an Allied invasion. It's a cliche now, but the war on two fronts hamstrung Germany enormously, meaning that insufficient force could be concentrated on driving the USSR back and beyond Moscow.

And even on casualty figures, of course the Eastern Front was the more decisive both strategically and in terms of critical mass. However don't forget either that the US, France and UK took over 7m prisoners of war compared to the USSR's 3m, indicating that the Western front was still a decisive front of the war. Perhaps it was not 'total' war in the same sense, with far lower casualty figures, but it was still absolutely key to neutralising Germany as a military force.

This is all argued very badly as I've hammered it out in a spare 5 minutes, and I could have made the argument much stronger and more coherent, but there was nothing inevitable about the USSR defeating Nazi Germany, it is impossible to judge although unlikely that the USSR on its own would have seen total victory without German resources being dragged right across Europe, having to maintain a Western and Southern front.

But even if it were the case, say that the USSR had single-handedly won the war, without the UK, US and allies (people shouldn't forget Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India etc.), where would Europe have been? I think we can categorically vouch that West of the iron curtain was a better place to be than East of it post 1945.

true,CatsAndSwords,Normandie,Normandie,"You didn't answer Fdurke's argument. A language does not exist in a vacuum: it carries a culture, an history... Spreading English means spreading the English-American culture. That's something you could disagree with. Personally I'd prefer a more balanced view, and would favorise other languages. An exposure to more diverse cultures seems more healthy.

Second point, you are making a bad usage of the word *nation*. A language is not tied to a *nation*, but to a people (and, in a lesser measure, a country). Linking every cultural difference to nationalism is dishonest.

Now, here is my third point, and that's where I'm going to disagree more strongly. Cultural differences ar a normal thing. It's normal that we know more about the country we've grown in and about its legends, its names, its history than about what happens three thousands miles away. It resonates with our environment. What you are longing for, if I understand, is the disparition the cultural differences (of which the language is only one of the aspects); ""If the world is homogeneous, then there is no reason for war"". It seems really optimistic to think that wars can be supressed that way. On the other hand, it seems really pessimistic that, if you could end all wars, the supression of cultural differences would be necessary.

And frankly, I'm not sure the result is worth the price.

==========

Edit: I want to argue a bit more about these two lines: ""It seems really optimistic to think that wars can be supressed that way. On the other hand, it seems really pessimistic that, if you could end all wars, the supression of cultural differences would be necessary.""

First, the history is rife with wars and genocides between people with little cultural differences and the same language. Examples [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia), [3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution), [4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terreur). So the claim that ""national identity"" has been tied to every war for the last 8000 years."" is naive at best, and associating the differences of language is just plain false.

Secondly, given that there has been no major war between first-world powers in a few generations, you could argue that cultural and commercial bonds, as well as wealth, are at least as good at preventing wars.",0,1369246432,null,0,1369252141,0,ca3vsjq,t3_1etxzy,t1_ca3vsjq,t1_ca3tzk4,null,1431069752,8,false,france,t5_2qhjz,8

true,PostHedge_Hedgehog,SWED,Sweden,"I think that the integration policies play a very small part in this drama. As most European countries at the moment, Sweden is suffering from a high unemployment rate among the youths. There is also the relatively new (i.e. less than 10 years old) policy of youths being able to apply for which high school they want to study in instead of automatically being assigned to the closest one. This policy has lead to a higher segregation between ""good"" and ""bad"" high schools, with all the dedicated students ending up at better ones, and those who don't give a crap about their education staying in the local, worse high school. I am quite sure that the people doing these riots belong to the latter group. They've got a bad education and no proper plans for their futures, they've grown up and stayed in areas with &gt;80% first generation immigrants and feel very little connection to the Swedish society, and they can't get a job because there is so much competition for them (and the employers prefer employees who speak proper Swedish). 

Personally I think that if anything should be changed, it's the law permitting immigrants to settle down in whichever city they want. Up until the 80s they had to settle and work for something around 2 years in a city with a high demand of workers, which led to immigrants being able to integrate themselves into the workforce quickly, instead of ending up in ghettos in Malmö (where the first generation immigrants have a employment participation rate of ~45% compared to 75% among the natives).",0,1369247054,null,0,false,0,ca3w1f2,t3_1etn5l,t1_ca3w1f2,t1_ca3p7va,null,1431069637,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

So Portuguese restaurants proudly display tiny bottles (the brands produce these tiny bottles for restaurants, isn't that innovative?!) from portuguese internationally reknowned olive oil brands to the customers and on the tables.

Can these be refilled? Of course, and so can wine bottles. But Portuguese people can tell the difference in taste and color. And it's illegal. Portugal has the strictest public hygiene police on this planet (ASAE) and they don't fuck around when it comes to drown restaurants in debt via fines for even the most minor of details.

Btw, local olive oil producers can't sell their product to restaurants, unless they're properly registered as a commercial brand, which entails many safety directives, among which quality control and selling their stuff in bottles properly labeled and protected from refilling (which, as I said above, only protects to some limited degree though).

People do this all the time here on /r/europe. I guess you don't read this much.

&gt; Doing so would be retarded, but still not racist (see above).

I think it does simplify the issue a lot. Trying to diversify between different xenophobic sentiments like racism and islamophobia doesn't really lead to anything, IMHO, because they are, in effect, every similar. So I tend to summarize them under ""racism"". I don't want to accuse you of anything, but most of the time I find that people that drone on and on about the perceived differences in these xenophobic sentiments are racists as well, most of the time. Though this might not apply to you. But I am pretty weary at this point. I cleary have been in /r/europe for too long.

it starts with the word ""multiculturalism"" itself. Which has completely different meaning to a lot of people. 

Unfortunately, over here in Germany, we don't have much German culture left anyways. We watch American television and movies, read mostly American or Britsh books (Harry Potter anyone?) and eat Italian food (pizza and pasta) for lunch. I think most Germans never eat German food for lunch. And these days we spend most of our time surfing American websites (Google, Facebook, Reddit). 

So we have some kind of freak blend of American and German culture we live in. And then we have some immigrants that dare to mix some of their culture with all the American culture everyone is having anyways and call it ""multiculturalism"". Like wearing a headscarf (which was normal in Germany 60 years ago, but not normal in Egypt 30 years ago). And for this reason tons of people get their panties in a bunch and feel ""threatened"" by those bad immigrants. While wearing jeans as pants. Or sneakers. Or whatever. It's basically a joke. Tons of idiots. But the idiocy doesn't stop there. In the name of ""European values"" they start to become racist (or islamophobe), which is pretty ironic, because those ""European values"" they claim to defend actually exclude any type of such xenophobia. So by claiming to ""defend"" from this perceived (though pretty much non existent) threat, they become, ideology wise, very close to the Islamists, that also have a lot of obvious contradictions in their life style vs their teachings.

That is false.

No. But there are a lot of factors that play into that.

&gt;Please tell me why multiculturalism is needed.

Christianity, however, is a religion of peace according to the New Testament and the reported lessons of Jesus. i don't believe in Christianity, but I admit that its message, according to the New Testament, is one of peace, love, forgiveness. The main problem I have with Christianity (apart from the detestable Old Testament) is the notion of Hell, which is totally psycho, ridiculous and fucked up. 

Now here's the main difference between Christianity and Islam. In Christianity, the example to follow is Jesus, who, whether he existed or not, was reported to be a loving, compassionate, peaceful man. In Islam, the example to follow is Muhammad, who was a warlord, extremely vengeful and cruel to his enemies or to those who ""sinned"" and disobeyed him and his teachings. This is a fundamental difference in teachings. We all know Christians have committed crime in history in the name of their religion, but that is irrelevant. What's relevant is if their actions were in accordance to the teachings of their religion, and technically, a Christian ""killing an infidel"" is in opposition of what his religion teaches, which isn't the case for Islam.

**Belgium** Herge (Tintin). I think Morris (Lucky Luke) was Belgian, wasn't he? I'm thinking several other comics artists here, but the changes are about 50/50 if they were French, so I think I'll stay silent. Somebody else than a comic writer, perhaps? Can't think anybody. Dammit. Can't even remember that king who fucked up Congo really good. Leopold? The First? No, must be at least second, because he would be hard act to follow and you don't list the First. So, Leopold the Second. That's the ticket.

**Netherlands** Uh. This is surprisingly hard. That painter with missing ear. Ah well, It's almost midnight. I'm sure it will come to me. Vincent Van Gogh! Oh yeah! Have you guys done anything since then? And I think there was that another great painter, did that autopsy painting. Hope it comes to me. EDIT: REMBRANT! DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GOOGLE!

**England** Eh.. Beckham (this is the only footballer who's name I actually know)? The OP's post made me think of this. And Victoria Beckham. Stephen Fry. 

**Scotland** Ah fuck. I even lived here. William the Bruce (this is a cop-out). Mel Gibson (based on the frequently he's mentioned in every museum, you couldn't believe he's Australian, so here he goes). Grant Morrison. 

**Ireland** Graham Norton. Graham Linehan. I hope I can remember one of Linehan's stars. They were all pretty much Irish as well, weren't they? I think Garth Ennis was Irish. Can't remember on which side of the border, so I'll just say that this entry is for the ""Isle of Ireland"". Haha!

**Wales**. I can only think that one actress in Torchwood and can't remember her name either. Sorry.

**Poland**. Sorry, your names are so lacking of vowels that even the people I can remember I can't spell. EDIT: I remember! That radioactive lady. Maria Currie! 

**Russia** Astahov. Putin. Lenin. Long list of tsars which served as Finnish Grand Dukes. General-Governor Bobrikov. 

**Spain** I think Coelho was Spanish. Does Sergio Aragones count? I hate listing politicians, but I'm going with Franco here.

**Portugal** Can't remember even one name to save my life. Even Columbus was Spanish, I think?

Same with people in sufficient numbers. The individual cannot be judged on this basis, but lots of them make predictions about their behaviour possible. More or less violent than a control group, prone to suppression of women or not accepting gays, for example. That's what a census is all about.

If you have immigrants in large numbers, an educated guess about their behaviour is doable if you assume that they kept their culture. Note: This has nothing to do with racism. As almost every American proves, race doesn't play a role if you accept the culture of your new home. I envy the Americans for that.

Bottom line: I only judge a person on its individual philosophy and individual actions. For large groups, however, I am OK with using stereotypes.

EDIT: And to make it perfectly clear: Having more educated immigrants, people who are *able and willing* to accept their new surroundings, is a very good way to overcome these reservations and make the stereotypes disappear.

What it actually means is 19 people disagreed with him, but not only that but they're fucking idiots and don't understand reddiquette and think the downvote is the ""disagree button"". Too much of that sadly.

However, apart from those criticisms it was pretty error free. You could understand what he was saying most of the time, but sometimes you just had to think about it a little longer and work out what he means. 

Definitely fine to have a conversation with, but I wouldn't trust him to right up legal documents.

Many countries have university courses at a higher level in English. Not only for international students either - if that was the case Pouria Amirshahi may be right in that it sends the wrong message to potential French-learners. Why learn French to study in France when you can learn English and study in France? Even though this is a bit of a self-absorbed opinion I can understand it.   
  
But that's NOT the only reason for having English-language courses - a huge reason behind it is for FRENCH students to have the ability to do some of their studies in English. This is done in many courses in Sweden for topics where international communication is key (economics, IT, business, etc). Unless they're up for sitting around until the English-speaking world speaks French they may as well do themselves a favour and give themselves a head-start in the work market by making themselves more appealing. Having a bilingual education in their field of study will do this.

Eine Gleichbehandlung von Paketen mit unterschiedlichen Zielen widerspricht dem Konzept von Pfadvektorprotokollen in paketvermittelten Netzwerken.

Eine Bevorzugung oder Ungleichbehandlung bedeutet nicht zwangsläufig das Durchsatz weniger wird, es kann auch bedeuten das Durchsatz steigt (weil Daten aufgrund unterschiedlicher Parameter auf unterschiedliche Kapazitäten verteilt werden).

Eine Priorisierung von Diensten/Paketen/Signalen (Notfallsignal) ist in konvergierenden Netzen zwingend erforderlich, niemand möchte das ein Paket seines Not- oder Alarmsignals verworfen wird.

Diskriminierung basierend auf Teilnehmern kann eine technische Notwendigkeit sein um Verfügbarkeit für eine größere Anzahl Teilnehmer zu gewährleisten.

America is a country born out of European languages (there are even German dialects in America like Pennsylvania dutch), religion, cultures, philosophy (enlightenment, etc.) and ancestries, no matter how much Europeans would dismiss or downplay this. Hence why the designation of Western Civilization exists. Islamic civilization is something else entirely founded around entirely different characteristics. 

European and Western Civilization has been fairly cosmopolitan for several centuries, there is nothing new there. European classical music and the arts have been continental, with artists in very different countries producing art in the same genre. Various fashion styles have come in and out of favour across Europe and the West through time. Architecture, philosophy, sports, etc. This is why it makes no sense to say ""german civilization"" or ""german culture"" as if it exists in isolation. It doesn't and it hasn't for hundreds of years.

true,embicek,CZEC,Czech Republic,"Every private gun trade needs to be registered with police, actually every legal firearm. The police is very strict against (non-influential) individual legal owners.


One large domestic source of illegal weapons are those discarded by police and army and modified not to be able to shoot. Those were several times sold to crime connected companies  (Czech police is defunct against organized crime) and modified to work again. Many were then sold abroad.


Another large source was Soviet army when they left the country in 1991. Their own country was on edge of collapse and the soldiers sold automatic rifle or grenades for a bottle of alcohol.


Some weapons and explosives got here from the Yugoslav wars, many remain from WWII (it was quite common for older timers to keep that  dropped German rifle hidden in attic).



Police estimates that number of illegal guns is about the same as legal guns but it doesn't mean they are used in crime. Penalty for keeping an illegal weapon was until recently very low, especially during the communist era, so the risk to have that rusty WWII rifle, just in case, was low.


The low actual use of firearms is IMO due to culture. Several generations grew up in a world of very low violence and this is still felt and observed. The police resigned to deal with small unarmed crime but still manages to solve most of gun related crimes (even those where a dummy is used), so waving a gun is disincentive for a common criminal. For large mafias, such as the Russian, the country serves are safe haven with no danger from the authorities, so we do not get those Holywood style gangster shootings either (unlike Slovakia).

Beer is also accepted, you will find that in Sevilla mostly everytime you will get a very cold Cruzcampo beer. Not the best beer in the world, but when it's 40º outside and you get it at 1º or 2º it's mana from the sky.

There's plenty of things to see in Sevilla, and surely some redditor from there can recommend better, but the rest of Andalusia is worth a visit too if you have the time and/or the money.

Cordoba is very beautiful and you can probably see it in just a day, but it's as hot as Seville, sometimes even more (less humidity though). It's a 1:30 hour drive or 45 minutes train (www.renfe.com to see how much it costs). Same goes for Granada, but a bit farther away from Seville.

If you like going to the beach I would recommend going to Cadiz, Tarifa is nice but windy, and Zahara de los Atunes is cool too. It's a bit far away, though. Huelva is closer to Sevilla, and also has nice beaches, though I personally prefer Cadiz. Malaga has plenty of stuff too, both the city and some nice beaches if you stay away from the ones in the city.

Then there's Almeria. The city itself is not my type, but there are some incredible beaches like Cabo de Gata (again, stay away from the ones in the city). There's a desert there, but it's not exactly the best thing to do in summer.

Lastly Jaen, which might seem the least attractive one, and I'm not a big fan of the city itself, but has some nice towns like Úbeda &amp; Baeza, and it's mind blowing the amount of Olive Trees there are in the area. If you like Olive Oil, the best one in Spain &amp; IMHO the whole world is done there.

This applies to all the cities: the best thing down there is eating outside, food &amp; drinks is extremely good and cheap, so if it's your thing, try some food tourism. Fish is great even in inner cities, but it's especially good in the coast.

 Your use of ""chance"" makes it sound like there's an element of probability in this, like education is randomly given out and that immigrants don't usually get it. 

What you meant to say was that immigrants, on average, perform a lot worse in school compared to ethnic Swedes and therefore have a tougher time getting a proper university education.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;And how much I as Finnish taxpayer have paid for that? Nothing. And my parents generation? Nothing. And my grand parents generation? Nothing.

You and your descendants will, as soon as you start nuclear. Tell me how much the reactor under construction in Finland has exceeded its budget already... before even having produced a single kWh of electricity.

&gt;And that is why energy companies are investing billions after billions to build solar thermal plants... Oh, but they aren't, and they aren't because it is not profitable.

Because, as I've already said, the externalities aren't accounted for. Even so the idea is rather recent, research investments so far are absolute dwarfed by those in nuclear, and *still* it's coming closer and closer to profitability.

&gt;Finnish energy producer Teollisuuden Voima

... is part of the Fennovoima consortium. 

&gt;In start E.ON Kärnkraft Finland owned 34% of Fennovoima and Voimaosakeyhtiö SF owned 66%. Voimaosakeyhtiö SF had initially 69 shareholders.[8] In October 2012, E.ON announced a plan to sell its 34% stake in the company as a part of the decision to withdraw from Finland.[10][11] Several finnish shareholders have left the project, currently over 40% of the shares are for sale. Most major municipal energy companies, including Helsinki, are shareholders **making majority of Finnish tax payers in the end financially responsibility of all potential extra costs of the future nuclear power plant.**

And then we're not even counting the fact that in the case of a major disaster it will still be the people and their state that bears the brunt of the cleanup problems.

&gt;In Finland nuclear companies contribute to two funds, to one fund that is to be used to decommission and dismantle the power plants after they have been stopped, and another one to dispose nuclear waste.

The consortium pays a flat fee, and the government bears the risk. The government and society are effectively acting as an insurer for the private company.

&gt;There is no point on favoring small businesses or small investors.

There is: the market functions better when there is a lower barrier to entry, so more competing offers are on the market and collusion is harder. Non-intervention is not always a guarantee for the highest efficiency, much like putting traffic lights on a crossroads can improve traffic flow.

&gt;And the immense profits of these new lines can be used to build future lines... Yeah..... Probably not.

We can't say anything yet. In any case much of the advantages are diffuse benefits to society and don't show up on the bookkeeping.

true,PreviousNickStolen,null,null,"&gt;This paragraph sounds weird. In one instance you're saying that immigrants have it hard and few prospects of advancing in life, in the next you're talking about immigrants who do succeed in life and move away.

Yes? It's not a homogenous group of people. Some of the refugees (refugees, not immigrants to be 100% clear here) come from countries like Iraq, Libya or former Yugoslavia, some of them have educated parents. Some of them come from Somalia and other African countries, if we're lucky they can read. 

&gt; Your use of ""chance"" makes it sound like there's an element of probability in this, like education is randomly given out and that immigrants don't usually get it.

It is, you go to school where you live, and depending on where you live more exactly there is a big chance you end up in a school with only other immigrants more or less. That doesnt neccessarily mean you're fucked but most of the time, yes it does.

&gt; What you meant to say was that immigrants, on average, perform a lot worse in school compared to ethnic Swedes and therefore have a tougher time getting a proper university education. 

Yes, although I believe that can be fixed, at least for second generation refugees. Second generation IMMIGRANTS (meaning worker immigration) should have no problems whatsoever unless they purposefully put themselves in a really retarded situation by staying in these areas.

&gt;Practically all education is paid for by the state so I would still claim that Sweden is a country where being poor is a lot easier compared to other countries.

Yes, there is no denying that. It doesn't mean its as easy as being a white swede growing up in a middle class home where the ""default"" route is thru university however.

&gt;Prima di leggere l'articolo viene spontaneo immaginare due apparecchi di misura identici, uno in ingresso e uno in uscita, e un semplice calcolo per sottrazione: ma emerge che non è stato usato nulla del genere. C'è invece un complicatissimo sistema basato sull'osservazione del calore emesso, dal quale si deduce poi (con mille approssimazioni) l'energia corrispondente. Perché? L'impressione è che si sia scelto un metodo inutilmente complicato per confondere e abbagliare con grafici e tabelle a profusione.

Questo secondo me e' falso.. Intanto la differenza tra l'entrata e l'uscita e' effettivamente il metodo usato, solo che non e' cosi' semplice. Le ""mille approssimazioni"" di cui parla sono tutte approssimazioni conservative, volte cioe' a confutare la tesi che l'ecat funzioni, piuttosto che a dimostrarla. E sono MOLTO conservative, tanto che (presupponendo che il tutto sia vero), i valori potrebbero essere maggiori anche di piu' di un ordine di grandezza.

Il sistema non e' ""inutilmente complicato"", anzi e' molto lineare, certo si sta facendo scienza e bisogna prendere in considerazione tutto, gli input gli output, la forma del cilindro, distribuzioni varie etc, da cui la complessita'.

Lamentarsi poi dei ""grafici e tabelle a profusione"" e' proprio stupido, visto che sono proprio quelli l'anima di un analisi. Cosa pretendeva paolo, un SI/NO ? I dati sono complessi e le tabelle e grafici sono utilissimi per capirne tutti gli aspetti, visto che che quelli presenti nel paper sono anche abbstanza chiari.

Insomma, io di solito stimo molto Attivissimo e quello che scrive, ma qui mi e' proprio scaduto. Proprio lui, alfiere del metodo scientifico e della precisione nell'esporre le cose, che mi parla di grafici a profusione?

Merde, un historien? Tu veux dire quelqu'un qui a un diplôme reconnu par l'état dans un domaine lié à l'histoire ou quelqu'un qui a publié dans des revues à comité de lecture ? Ah non, tiens donc, comme c'est bizarre :

« Je suis écrivain dans la mesure où je m'attache à la forme de ce que j'écris. Je suis historien par vocation, désir passionné de comprendre et souci d'honnêteté. Je me veux avant tout un esprit libre, sans attache politique ou idéologique, ayant décidé de travailler en dehors des contraintes universitaires. »

Il est pas devenu nationaliste en s'intéressant à l'histoire, il s'est intéressé à l'histoire après une carrière politique à la droite de la droite.

&gt; Au contraire, c'est parce que la France est un pays extrêmement diversifié, avec en son sein des peuples très différents et opposés entre eux, qu'il faut un État fort, centralisé, avec un mythe national et une identité revendiquée, pour éviter que les Français ne se fassent la guerre entre eux.

Je suis même pas en désaccord avec ça et je pense que la majorité de la classe politique serait assez d'accord avec également. 

&gt; Rien à voir avec la couleur de peau donc.

Le ton de sa lettre permet d'en douter :

&gt; J’aime la vie et n’attend rien au-delà, sinon la perpétuation de ma race et de mon esprit.

Most countries during the emigration waves (which they were all to happy to get, because they needed the man power) created housing projects in these suburbs. They just created big ass ugly buildings with a school around and public transportation, because those workers needed to get the big city. The first generation, from what I was able to gather, was pretty happy with the original conditions: they had housing, running water, a job, a life for their kids, a pension for when they will be old. But then, those countries stopped there. They didn't continue creating cities out of these projects, they left them out there. If you walk by these places you'll see there's no local stores, no cinemas... just cement. Of course the second generation realized they were given the short end of the stick. Some worked hard to get out, most stayed and formed a sub-culture that sociologists could explain better than I can (if they get their heads out of their asses). 

Now, most big cities are looking at the third generation and its not a nice picture. These are young people that feel they don't belong in the country they're living (a simple conclusion if they just look at their parents and grandparents that are still living in the projects) and they have nothing to do with the original countries or regions.

Un contratto, una legge, una risoluzione internazionale, un testo medico comporta responsabilità enormi e richiede capacità specifiche estremamente importanti che esulano dal semplice concetto di ""complessità"", ed entrano nel campo del ""la traduzione officiale è questa, se non traduci così non ottieni un testo equivalente e in caso di danni sei penalmente perseguibile"". Io ho studiato traduzione e interpretariato per 6 anni, ho sostenuto esami e prove di traduzione di ogni genere e, alla fine del mio percorso di studi (subito prima della tesi), ho dovuto sostenere quattro prove ""alla cieca"" senza delle quali non mi sarei laureato. Questo perchè si immettono nel mercato solo ed esclusivamente le persone in grado di svolgere quel determinato mestiere.

La risoluzione e' 1280*720pixel, un po' piu' bassa ad esempio rispetto a quella dell'Ipad , ma e' comunque una risoluzione elevata, i video li vedi bene per intenderci. Il processore e' quad core da 1.3Ghz, da far invidia ai PC di qualche anno fa, ha 1 GB di RAM,e un processore grafico NVIDIA Tegra 3. L'Ipad non se le sogna nemmeno queste specifiche tecniche.

Android e' magari piu' indietro in alcuni generi di applicazioni, non trovi tutte quelle app che ad esempio ti fanno far musica dal tablet (intendo quelle professionali con miliardi di funzioni,le semplici app le trovi tranquillamente), oppure non trovi tutta quella scelta nel campo dei giochi.
Il divario pero' si sta assottigliando.
 Alla fine pero' le stesse cose che puoi fare sul tuo S2 le puoi fare probabilmente meglio su un qualsiasi tablet. 

Del Nexus 7 c'è anche una versione con 3G+WiFi,oltre quella solo WiFi, che ti permette di inserire la SIM all'interno del tablet e naviagare in internet ovunque. 
Ci sono 3 versioni in commercio, una da 8GB di memoria, una da 16GB e una da 32.
Non ha lo slot della SD Card, ma come ti ho detto prima puoi metterci la chiavetta USB.

Dipende dalle persone, ovviamente. Però un traduttore ha studiato QUELLO e SOLO QUELLO, e in generale ***dovrebbe*** (condizionale d'obbligo: i cani ci sono ovunque, in tutte le professioni) essere più affidabile di un laureato in lingue.

Se dovessi fare un paragone, direi che il ""laureato in lingue"" e il ""laureato in traduzione"" sono un po' come il ""medico generico"" e il ""medico chirurgo"": davanti a un uomo con problemi di cuore che ha bisogno di un trapianto, entrambi sanno cosa cercare e cosa va fatto, ma solo uno di loro sa dove mettere mettere le mani nel corpo del paziente. Per il semplice fatto che nel suo percorso formativo ha messo le mani in dozzine di cadaveri e, durante la specializzazione, in diversi pazienti.

Poi non è escluso che in mancanza di un chirurgo (che ne so, su un'isola deserta, tipo LOST) un medico generico possa tentare un intervento (magari non un trapianto di cuore, però hai capito cosa intendo).
Ma spero concorderai con me che quando ti serve un architetto non chiami un muratore (ripeto: senza alcuna offesa e con il massimo rispetto per entrambe le professioni [da bambino volevo fare il muratore, tra l'altro]), anche se il muratore ha delle conoscenze in comune con l'architetto. Sono due posizioni molto diverse.

Detto questo, io non volevo assolutamente fare il burbero e sminuire la tua laurea e le tue capacità.

EDIT: Ci sono anche tantissimi contesti in cui il medico generico è più indicato del chirurgo. E allo stesso modo, ci sono contesti in cui il laureato in lingue è migliore di un laureato in traduzione. Io, ad esempio, lavoro con il cinese mandarino e conosco tantissimi laureati in lingue orientali che conoscono alla perfezione aspetti della cultura e della letteratura cinese che io non ho mai sentito nominare.

We don't forget, and that's why very few of us dare judge immigrants' behaviour abroad. We were them. We know ghettoes, we know what it is to be stopped by the police just because our skin is darker than the northeners, and we know what it was to be illiterate, low skilled and hungry.

To forget, for us, is to have no dignity. Moaning about this stuff is for the weak. We remember who we were, we take in the immigrants today and we work with them, judging one by one, not as a group, as we would have liked to be judged back in the day. It would be a loss of face to do any differently, because if we said a racist remark, any of our neighbours would slag us, reminding us how our grandfather had to beg for a job abroad, dirty and hungry.

true,ginger_beer_m,null,null,"Allow me to comment on the east asian thing. 

I'm ethnically chinese, living in the UK. For better or worse, the East Asian upbringing generally emphasises a lot on achieving success in life through hard work &amp; education. Bringing prestige for the family comes from achieving a good career, earning lots of money, or preferably both. Similarly, claiming benefits and depending on government handouts can be considered quite shameful in certain circles, since you're viewed as a good for nothing and sort of failure in life. In this way, we're quite a greedy lot actually. 

So well, the only way to achieve this sort of success is to educate the shit out of your children. Most parents typically push their children into the 'stable' professional jobs, such as engineering, doctors, finance, IT, etc. With minimal language barrier, educated people usually integrate well in the host country. After a few generations, we'd even lose the ability to speak Chinese -- since it's a bloody hard language to be fluent in, without constant practice and total immersion -- and pretty much get completely localised in the new country. At least, I feel that's the case for the Chinese community in the UK. Inter-racial marriages are also quite common, despite the objection of the older generations :) 

The end result is a more integrated immigrant community as compared to the asylum refugees, who face a completely different circumstances in life.

PS. especially if the original immigrant parents still have relatives in Asia whom they still keep in touch with and who're doing well due to the healthy economic growth there, it's a *shame* not to have your children here to be successful as well.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; You and your descendants will, as soon as you start nuclear. Tell me how much the reactor under construction in Finland has exceeded its budget already... before even having produced a single kWh of electricity.

Nope. TVO ordered EPR from Areva with fixed-price contact, that means that budget and timetable overruns will be paid by Areva. Actually Areva owns TVO plenty of money in contractual penalties because they haven't been able to construct the nuclear reactor in the time-frame they agreed in contract.

&gt; Because, as I've already said, the externalities aren't accounted for. Even so the idea is rather recent, research investments so far are absolute dwarfed by those in nuclear, and still it's coming closer and closer to profitability.

Lets get back to this when it will be profitable.

&gt;&gt;Finnish energy producer Teollisuuden Voima
&gt;... is part of the Fennovoima consortium.

Is not part of the Fennovoima consortium. TVO and Fennovoima are two different companies. TVO was founded in 1969 and Fennovoima in 2007. TVO operates two reactors, is building one currently more, and has a permit to build forth reactor in Eurajoki, western Finland. Fennovoima won a permit to build a reactor to Pyhäjoki, northern Finland. Two different companies. The one thing that they have common is that they are funded privately.

&gt; In start E.ON Kärnkraft Finland owned 34% of Fennovoima and Voimaosakeyhtiö SF owned 66%. Voimaosakeyhtiö SF had initially 69 shareholders.[8] In October 2012, E.ON announced a plan to sell its 34% stake in the company as a part of the decision to withdraw from Finland.[10][11] Several finnish shareholders have left the project, currently over 40% of the shares are for sale. Most major municipal energy companies, including Helsinki, are shareholders making majority of Finnish tax payers in the end financially responsibility of all potential extra costs of the future nuclear power plant.

Shareholders are not responsible for liabilities of the company they own. And in case of Helsingin Energia, the thing is that they have put money to this project because it is the cheapest way they can generate energy. And let me remind you that Finnish energy prices are one of the lowest in Europe, much lower than in Germany for example.

&gt; The consortium pays a flat fee, and the government bears the risk. The government and society are effectively acting as an insurer for the private company.

Nuclear companies pay what is calculated they need to pay for these two funds that I previously said. And in case of accidents, lets put it like this, there is no insurance against wild running global climate change. Either you take that risk or the one with nuclear that actually isn't a risk as it is under control.

&gt; There is: the market functions better when there is a lower barrier to entry, so more competing offers are on the market and collusion is harder. Non-intervention is not always a guarantee for the highest efficiency, much like putting traffic lights on a crossroads can improve traffic flow.

Nope. Increased competition decreases profit margins, but most of the  efficiencies are gained from scale of economies. The best situation is that you have three to four major corporations that compete with each others limiting profit margins, but who can also leverage most out of the scale of economies.

&gt; We can't say anything yet. In any case much of the advantages are diffuse benefits to society and don't show up on the bookkeeping.

If that is so then the Spanish municipalities and cities will get huge windfalls from increased economic activity that will show up as an increase of paid taxes. ",0,1369318207,null,0,false,0,ca4g45r,t3_1erzd7,t1_ca4g45r,t1_ca4dhyq,null,1431060036,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Oui, pour avoir lu quelques textes du GRECE, ils évoquent tous les points communs que l’Europe, et en particulier la France, ont avec la Rome Antique. Ils sont très critiques envers le christianisme, en tant que courant de pensée, et tiers-mondistes, puisqu'ils pensent que la cause de la pauvreté du tiers-monde est due aux interventions étrangères. Ainsi, ils sont en faveur d'un ""chacun chez soi"".

&gt;le mot race, qui a un sens en français

Ce mot a changé de sens depuis assez peu de temps (50 ans). C'est un grand classique de novlangue : quand on ne peut pas changer les choses, on change le sens des mots.

&gt;Trois passages ramenant à mots couverts à l'invasion barbare

Oui, c'est exactement sa théorie. L'invasion de l'empire romain par les Vandales et les Wisigoths. Pas une question de couleur de peau ni de religion.

&gt;c'est qui ""ses aïeux"" qui ont construit Notre Dame ? 

Des Français.

&gt;Je peux y prétendre aussi ? 

Oui, si tu es Français. En fait, pour être plus précis, selon sa théorie, tous les Français doivent revendiquer le génie de ceux qui ont construit Notre-Dame.

&gt;Qu'entend-il par ses ""origines immémoriales"" ? Ça remonte à qui et quand ? 

Ça remonte à l'Empire Romain. Je ne suis pas un grand fan de cette théorie, mais elle est en vogue et soutenue également par Zemmour dans son livre ""Mélancolie française"".

&gt;Le ""remplacement de nos populations"" c'est quoi exactement ? Quelle population qui est remplacée par quelle population ? 

C'est l'immigration de masse qui reste entre elle. C'est un thème également développé par Renaud Camus dans son livre ""le Grand Remplacement"". L'idée est que l'assimilation se fait par le sang (guerre et héritage) ou par le cœur (mariage, fonctionnariat) tout en se débarrassant de son ancienne identité, du moins en public.

The youth = *The Immigrants* of all age.

A Swedish man = A male person, who has been granted the citizenship of Sweden. Usually either a Muslim, black African or both.

Repression = Not really repression, but generally lower standard of living than in Sweden.

War = Not really war, but generally lower standard of living than in Sweden.

Asylum seeker = A person escaping *war* or *repression*. Usually coming from a country with lots of poverty and/or Islam.

Temporal residency = The residency doesn't extend past the death of the resident.

A temporal resident = A person who tried to seek asylum, didn't get it, but is staying in Sweden anyway. Usually because Sweden won’t return anyone to a country with lots of poverty or Islam.

A work based immigrant = *An immigrant* who is not an *asylum seeker*. This doesn't mean the person is actually working. Just that he/she could be. In theory.

Family member = Anyone, who claims to be related, married or adopted to an *asylum seeker* or *temporary resident*.

Family reunification process = A recursive process, where an *asylum seeker* or *temporary resident* tries to get the *temporary residency* for his/her *family members*. These *family members* can then start their own *family reunification processes*. On the official statistics the *family members* are considered as *work based immigrants*.

&gt;On 18 March 2004 the authorities - prosecutors, police, gendarmes, secret services - started an unprecedented intimidation campaign documented by the APADOR-CH (the local branch for the International Helsinki Committee for Human Rights) and reported by the IHF 2004 report.

He was then taken to Bucharest.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Nope. TVO ordered EPR from Areva with fixed-price contact, that means that budget and timetable overruns will be paid by Areva. Actually Areva owns TVO plenty of money in contractual penalties because they haven't been able to construct the nuclear reactor in the time-frame they agreed in contract.

Thereby convincingly disproving that nuclear is a cheap and easy way to produce energy. They'll just raise the price of the electricity afterwards to make up for it. And the state and society still are burdened themselves with all the risks of nuclear energy in exchange for a nominal fee.

&gt;Lets get back to this when it will be profitable.

Sure, and that will be pretty soon: nuclear energy was absolutely nowhere after putting in the same research effort and funding. Get back with nuclear too when it's profitable without shoving off the risks on somebody else.

&gt;Is not part of the Fennovoima consortium. TVO and Fennovoima are two different companies. TVO was founded in 1969 and Fennovoima in 2007. TVO operates two reactors, is building one currently more, and has a permit to build forth reactor in Eurajoki, western Finland. Fennovoima won a permit to build a reactor to Pyhäjoki, northern Finland. Two different companies. The one thing that they have common is that they are funded privately.

Yes, they're different, my bad. Nevertheless: Fennovoima only has a consortium structure, but nevertheless most of the money comes from municipalities. TVO as well: it may be private, but the biggest shareholder is Pohjolan Voima... and significant shareholders of PVO are, again, power and energy companies owned by municipalities. ""Funded privately"" is a very relative description. Just follow the money.

&gt;Shareholders are not responsible for liabilities of the company they own.

That's exactly the problem I layed out above: private companies are not responsible for the risks they take.

&gt;And let me remind you that Finnish energy prices are one of the lowest in Europe, much lower than in Germany for example.

Most of the difference are taxes, and with or without taxes, Finland has prices somewhat below the European average, not remarkably cheaper than elsewhere... not counting the risks that will, one way or another, be borne by the taxpayer.

&gt;Nuclear companies pay what is calculated they need to pay for these two funds that I previously said.

That calculation is based on the best-case scenario. Anything else: the state can play the maid and clean it up.

&gt;And in case of accidents, lets put it like this, there is no insurance against wild running global climate change. 

Two wrongs don't make a right.

&gt;Either you take that risk or the one with nuclear that actually isn't a risk as it is under control.

Yeah, and the Titanic can't sink. They had a shiny new ship and the best technology available, and everything was under control. Guess what happened? Tepco also said they had everything under control in Fukushima. Guess what happened? And don't start with ""nothing *really* bad happened. These are commercial companies and they have a permanent, vested interest in cutting corners to increase profits.

&gt;If that is so then the Spanish municipalities and cities will get huge windfalls from increased economic activity that will show up as an increase of paid taxes.

Or in the form of continued mobility when fossil fuels become more expensive.
