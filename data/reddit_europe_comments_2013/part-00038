true,almodozo,null,null,"I think a situation where a minority government manages to still get things done by, as you seem to suggest, pragmatically seeking different majorities in parliament for each bill - maybe working with conservatives and liberals on one issue, but with liberals and socialists on another, etc - only works if there is some basic level of consensus in place in the country, and some willingness to work in good faith.

If you live in a country where politics is relatively consensual, and even the left and right-wing parties can easily find some things they agree on, this can work. If you live in a country where political parties have a rudimentary level of civic spirit that enables them to allow even their opponents the occasional policy achievement and PR win if that's what's needed to keep a government in place, this could work.

It doesn't look like Italy is such a country. The Senate is where the problem is, as preliminary results give the center-left 123 seats, Berlusconi's populist right 118 seats, Beppe Grillo's protest party 53 seats, and Monti's coalition just 19 seats. Grillo tonight has vowed ""war"" and ""no deals"". So that's a sixth of the seats right there that will be, at least for the time being, unavailable for such shifting majorities: his MPs will probably turn out to be less dogmatically against everything than him over time, but for now they will have little reason to veer from the political line he set out with such immense success. Neither Berlusconi + Monti nor the center-left + Monti have a majority. So in practice, you'd need all three other political forces to collaborate to make those majorities for individual bills materialize. Since the minor parties within each of those three coalitions have almost without exception fared badly, there aren't many minor groupings you can peel off for one or the other bill: it really is just three main parties facing off against each other.

This raises both a tactical and a substantive problem with your vision. Substantively, there just isn't a whole lot of urgent policy that people with views and values as divergent as Berlusconi's, Monti's and Bersani's will be able to agree on as being ""good for the country"". Tactically, each of the three parties (or, in practice, primarily the center-left and Berlusconi's right) will know that new elections are bound to ensue soon, and they will be more inclined to spend their time positioning themselves politically for the next campaign than to collaborate in good faith even in the unlikely case there *would* be something substantive they'd agree on. Because political parties, in election campaigns, thrive on emphasizing what makes them different from each other; and when distrust and enmity are as deeply seated as between the left and right in Italy, there is little reason why either of them would allow the other to gain any political credit for legislation passed.

I mean, it worked for a little while, initially, under Monti, when both the center-left and Berlusconi supported the government's initial steps. But that was under the imminent threat of the country's economic collapse - and it didn't last (otherwise they wouldn't have had these elections). Berlusconi turned virulently against austerity and Brussels; and since it seems to have saved his political hide one last time, he won't easily turn around on that again. And even if Bersani, Monti and Berlusconi miraculously do come together again 'for the good of the country', their lack of substantive agreement on anything beyond emergency measures would mean political stagnation, and thanks to the skittishness of investors, the economy would start slipping rapidly again in the absence of any clear policy.

I'm guessing there will be new elections really soon.. maybe there will be an interim government to avert any imminent economic disaster and perhaps pass a new election law, and then it will organize new elections well within this year.",0,1361857260,null,0,1361857450,0,c8ltn7w,t3_1987kt,t1_c8ltn7w,t3_1987kt,null,1431413109,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Well also everyone who doesn't want to pay taxes votes for him.

Well, that is sort of my point of never understanding the Italians. You can not have a working society without paying taxes. So, if you vote for someone who claims that you do not need to, then you are in essence, voting for a ""non working society"". That I do not understand why one chooses to do. 

Furthermore, claiming that they will receive money back, after the fact, like Berlusconi did, is, if not impossible, at least a more bothersome endevour than cutting taxes in the future. Yet, people believed that. Also, the financing seem completely off the wall. And, that is for basically everything Berlusconi says, he completely ignores the financial situation in Italy. I am in Sweden, and are, if not fully aware, at least somewhat aware of the financial situation in Italy. The economy is shrinking for God's sake. The need for reforms is overwhelming. The competitiveness has and is sinking (comparison to Germany, salaries etc has been rising in the last 10 years),  and the only reason they are not being bailed out is that the ECB is buying Italian bonds. 

It is economics 101, and I refuse to believe that the average Italian is less interested in their countries economy, than the average Swede/Brit/German etc, but they willfully choose to vote for someone who isn't even attempting to solve the problem, but is in fact, making it worse. 

In our last election, the party that won, actually didn't promise lower taxes (nor did the opponent). They said that the taxes would only be lowered if the economy allowed it, and if Sweden have the back - up for it. That makes sense to me - who would to want to elect someone who is financial irresponsible? You can win elections in the Nordic countries with that sort of talk. 

That is why Italians do not make sense to me. I refuse to believe they are more uneducated, but yet they keep on voting for someone who can't even pass Economics 101.  How on earth do they expect it to be financed? It is so not economical sensible to vote for Berlusconi, that it baffles me. Why don't the Italians factor in stuff like the grim financial reality of Italy when they vote?

And, then we haven't even touched the fact that he is a corrupt, slimy asshole. 

&gt;A lot of regions in the south voted for far right movements (part of Berlusconi's coalition) that want them cut out of Italy, so you could say that Mafia is also a factor. 

Isn't that super, duper stupid? As far as I've understood, the north is sponsring the south, why would the south want to be cut off for that.

So it's largely the same thing.

Yes, but in a corrupted culture you won't get more actual free market, you will get favoritism and nepotism masquarading as more free market, and that is not good at all. Similarly you don't get social democracy, you get bribery and sweetheart deals.

I think corrupted cultures should have their own kind of ideology tailored to them, that combines both free-marketist and statist elements in a way to reduce corruption in both. Generally speaking the small business should be deregulated, the big business and big government made transparent.

A few words on Parisian public transportation :

- Avoid the rush hour if at all possible.

- Avoid changing lines at big stations. Especially Châtelet/Les Halles - NEVER change lines here if you can avoid it, it's a fucking maze.

Can you show me some documentation that Swedes lived in Northern Scandinavia before Saami? Not that it matters, what happened before in the area is not relevant to evaluate the relation between Swedes and Saami, as I explained before.

&gt;So, you count nomadic against nomadic - and Swedes came first. Thus, they are the colonizator.

Keeping the population that were present is colonization. What happened before doesn't matter.

&gt;So, the Sami colonized Sweden then, since we were there first, and then we are removed, or at least fairly few of us up north. That makes Sami the colonisator, not the colonized ones.

It doesn't matter who was first. Importing slaves to fulfill the subordinate role would still make it a colony. As I said, the Saami might have put the Swedes in a subordinate role before, which qualifies as colonization; that doesn't prevent the reverse from happening later. If Algeria would colonize France in the 22nd century, that would not undo the colonization of Algeria by France.

&gt;The romans never came that far, and I doubt they even knew anything about us during the Stone Age.

Now you're being disingenuous on purpose. Roman law was canon in Medieval Europe and their concepts were applied everywhere. In particular the practice that Romans had citizen rights, while the conquered people did not, is relevant. Roman cities there were *called* colonies, eg. Colonia Agrippina (Köln).

true,Solokian,null,null,"Pour moi Paris ça représente la ville la plus internationale de France (en même temps pas de surprise, c'est la capitale). On peut y trouver des magasins et restaurants du monde entier ou presque, ce qui n'est pas vrai ailleurs.


De plus il y a plusieurs villes dans Paris, car il y a une énorme différence entre (par exemple) le XVIe et le XIIIe. C'est pas seulement une question de richesse, mais aussi de culture, d'ambiance, de façon de vivre.


Bon après Bardaf a pas complètement tort, même s'il exprime sa pensée comme un vrai parisien. Dans les transports en commun et en voiture, on sent que les gens n'aiment pas être là, se renferment sur eux-même, sont assez désagréables et irrespectueux de l'autre.


Mais dans la rue, les cafés, etc il me semble que c'est différent, les gens sont plus cools et plutôt polis. Globalement c'est vrai qu'il y a une sorte d'atmosphère délétère à Paris, et on s'en aperçoit quand on quitte la ville pour quelques jours/semaines et qu'on y revient : on se demandent pourquoi les gens ne sourient pas plus, pourquoi ils sont stressés et speed comme ça...mais au bout de quelques semaines on est redevenus pareil !


Difficile de dire exactement pourquoi c'est comme ça, ça fait longtemps que je cherche la réponse mais je n'ai pas encore trouvé. Il y d'autres grandes villes, d'autres villes à forte densité de population, avec beaucoup d'immigration...mais Paris est unique dans son atmosphère morose. Je sais aussi que ce n'était pas comme ça il y quelques décennies.



For me Paris represents the most international city in France (no surprises here, it's the capital). You can find shops and restaurants from almost all over the world, which is not true elsewhere.


And there's several cities in Paris, because there's a huge difference between (for example) the XVIth district and the XIIIth district. It's not only about wealth, but also cutlure, ambiance and way of living.


But yeah, Bardaf is not completly wrong, even if he's stating his thoughts like a true parisian. In public transportation and when driving, you can tell people don't like to be there, lock themselves up, and are pretty rude and disrespectful of others.


But in the streets, cafés, etc it seems to me that it's different, people are more relaxed and rather polite. Generally it's true that there's a sort of  noxious atmosphere in Paris, and you can feel it when you leave the city for a few days/weels and come back : you wonder why people don't smile more, why they're so stressed and in a hurry...but then after a few weeks, you've become this way again too !


It's hard to pinpoint why it's like this, I've been trying to find out for a while now but still haven't found an answer. There's other big cities, other cities with a high density of population, with a lot of immigration...but Paris is unique in it's morose atmosphere.

C'est un Paris que j'aime, et que je fantasme complètement.

Mon Paris quotidien ressemble à celui de Bardaf ou à celui de Luoluoluo. Je dépense des fortunes pour ma vie sociale, à lâcher mes billets de 5 euros pour des cocktails immondes, à traîner dans des bars formatés, qui servent un brunch dégueulasse le dimanche, tout ça dans une ambiance de total mépris. 

Dans l'élite fortunée, les hipsters méprisent les bobos, qui méprisent les yuppies, qui méprisent les hipsters... Si tant est que toutes ces catégories aient un sens...

C'est une ville crasse, qui se croit ville lumière.

Pourtant, j'ai essayé de la quitter, et j'ai échoué.

Paris est une ville aux mille facettes, et parmi elles, j'en ai trouvé une qui me convient.

J'aime découvrir de nouveaux endroits, de nouvelles personnes. J'aime pendant les retours galère après une soirée arrosée, passer devant Notre Dame, le Musée d'Orsay ou la Gare de Lyon. J'aime échanger quelques passes de rugby avec mes potes sur la pelouse des Invalides avec le Grand Palais et la Tour Eiffel comme témoins. J'aime les visites de monuments, les concerts, les spectacles. J'aime le Meltdown, exemple même de ces lieux qui ne s'adressent qu'à une petite partie de la population, et auraient du mal à exister en province.

Ich würde es so formulieren: Natürlich traut sich die Polizei überall hin. Alles andere ist Unsinn. Aber bei Kleindelikten findet halt eine Abwägung statt. Der Klassiker: Parken in zweiter Reihe. Bleibt da der Schutzmann stehen und gibt ein Knöllchen, kann er schnell mal 30-40 empörte Bürger gegen sich haben. Und weil man dann halt Verstärkung holen muss, unterbleibt hier oft ein Handeln und es wird ignoriert (ich halte das für falsch - broken windows und so).

Bei Festnahmen, z.b. von Ladendieben, findet schon mal eine Solidarisierung mit dem Verhafteten statt, bis hin zur versuchten Gefangenenbefreiung. 

Der Aufwand, Dinge durchzusetzen, kann also sehr schnell einiges grösser werden als in Posemuckel, wo alle bei einer Uniform gleich stramm stehen.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; Because the debt is only primarily kept by people in Japan, not outside Japan.

You've got causation backwards. The Japanese people have a lot of savings *because* their government has a lot of debt.

If you consider the three sectors - private, public, foreign - if the private sector wants net savings, in a money=debt monetary system, it has to put (public + foreign) into net debt. Under the yen, this is fine - the Japanese people pushed their government into debt through continual deficits as they accrued savings. This is perfectly sustainable however, for the Japanese government, as the issuer of the currency, has no problem accruing yen-denominated debt. It can always assure bond holders that they'll be paid in yen in full as their bonds fall due.

Under the Euro, there's no way for the private sector to accrue savings in a sustainable fashion. By limiting the public sector to 60% of GDP debt through the EFC, we are limiting the net savings of the (private + foreign) sectors to 60% of GDP. If this does not meet their demand for savings, the [paradox of thrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift) will set in and you'll see demand collapse and job-loss.

*However*, if we were to create a new institution - say a United EMU government - that had its bonds backed by the central bank, it could supply everyone with the savings they desire so that demand need never collapse. We could keep employment and growth high at all times. Unfortunately, we don't have this - hence it being a flawed monetary union. A ticking time bomb, waiting to collapse demand and jobs any time a savings binge occurs throughout households across the EMU - ie on the back of a financial crisis like we have seen so recently.

&gt; If you've low external debt, but high internal debt, you've little risk of defaulting

Find me one example of a government that issues its own free-floating currency that has *ever* run into issue paying its bonds as they fall due. To my knowledge, it has not happened.

I don't see how it could, for their bonds are a promise from the currency-issuer - they are every bit as safe as the currency they are denominated in.",0,1361876763,null,0,false,0,c8lwk68,t3_198s25,t1_c8lwk68,t1_c8lwh57,null,1431414543,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,oink_oink,LOMB,Lombardy,"I used to like Berlusconi (and, no, don't worry, I didn't vote for him), so I will try and give you my point of view.

The first important premise is that (IMO) from the 60s up until the 90s Italy has been leaning a lot towards the left.  
The economy was doing relatively good, and left parties and labor unions managed to convince most people that employers are evil beings and employees are slaves.  
Social welfare was pushed to insane limits... Some people went to pension in their 50s or even earlier. All paid by tax money.  
The state held a lot of important monopolies, for example on telecommunications and energy.

Anyway, fast forward to the 90s: Italian businesses are stagnating. Creating a new business is a nightmare of taxes and bureaucracy.

We finally get a new guy on the political scene: Berlusconi, a successful businessman, who finally seems to bring new ideas. Basically what he suggests is to give more freedom to businesses to grow.

He gets elected!

What happens next? He gets involved in a load of problems with justice.

Is he corrupt? Probably yes.  
Every very successful businessman in Italy has to be corrupt to some degree in order to have his businesses thrive in such environment.

Was he targeted on purpose by the justice system only because of his political involvement? Probably yes.  
Given the pervasive problems of corruption in Italy it really makes no sense that they are focusing on Berlusconi so much if it was not for his decision to enter the political scene.

Is he right in saying the Italian justice is corrupt? Probably yes.  
There are many cases of fucked up uses of justice.  
A lot of public prosecutors and judges do fucked up things if their case has a chance for notoriety.  
Just look at the farce that was the murder charge against Amanda Knox.

Is he a good politician? Probably not.  
His ideas are/were good on paper. But he is obviously unable to bring them to reality because he never had and never will have enough consensus to revolutionize the Italian economy the way he imagines.  
Also, his problems with justice ARE a hindrance, regardless of whether they are a moral injustice or not. A ""decent"" politician would have just retired for good by now.  
Why does he keep going on? I suspect he NEEDS people to adore him in order to feel accomplished and that's the reason for him pulling more and more ridiculous media stunts.

The main problem with all his political opponents? They all keep falling for his trolling tactics and keep basing their whole political stance on ""we'll save you from Berlusconi"" instead of actually spending energy in explaining how they want to fix things.  
Well, all except Grillo, who also figured that if you act like a troll you get attention and win.

But other than that, obviously the city has different faces for different people, depending on your life, so don't slag me off for giving my experience, which I realise differs from many others. And obviously you need a budget. 

For me, I love my neighbourhood. I like the bars and restaurants I go to - friendly faces and great food. It is possible to have just perfect weekends. I love the impeccable infrastructure (metro, roads) which allows me to go all over the place fast. People are ridiculously polite in the metro, although I would wish they moved faster. Drivers are pretty relaxed, and you can drive through some of the most beautiful streets in the world comfortably (out if rush hour).  And what a drive it is, crossing Paris! People have a real pretence to live life well (intellectually) and that shows in funny and smart conversation. Very little concession is required when planning an evening. 

Paris hosts impeccable retrospective expositions, but is  weak in contemporary art (or: it s not very good). But the number of movies in the cinemas is just mind blowing, as are concerts. On contemporary dance/ theatre scene is rough - relatively few productions make it onto our stages and they are sold out on the spot. You could also say a lot of the fantastic cultural events suffer from over demand. It is flattering for Paris that people have such a high demand for any cultural event, but at the same time the success suffers. 

I love the slow pace, where you can laze in cafes without being pressed to drink or leave, and discuss deep into the night, for those who have the time. I love the ever changing deco style of the night establishments. I like that people take the time to create relationships with you rather than an anonymous exchange as is often the case in cities. It s relatively easy to make friends. Not something a lot of cities can say. 

Economy wise: Basically not much going on and people are not great to work with, as everything has to be done ""Lastminute"" which reduces quality and increases stress. This conflicts heavily with life and experience outside the walls of the office.

This has funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants."".

Assuming that foreign countries don't want to accrue Euro-denominated debt, net private sector savings are capped at 60% of GDP through the EFC, for the only way the private sector can accrue net savings is to put the public sector in to debt. If 60% is insufficient to meet the savings desires of households, demand will collapse and you'll see a crisis like the one currently underway.

They had issues, however their ""touching up"" meant continual growth and high employment through perfectly sustainable public sector deficits denominated in their own currencies.

Under the Euro high private sector surpluses are not possible for they mean high public sector deficits denominated in a currency that those governments do not issue. If the private sector *wants to run* high surpluses, that is, increase their savings in aggregate, they'll find themselves unable, and this will have negative consequences on aggregate demand and therefore jobs and the standard of living of all.

Di fronte alla plateale opposizione della Binetti, anziché cacciarla a calci in culo come sarebbe avvenuto in qualsiasi partito, hanno glissato. Alla fine se n'è andata lei

* In generale, su qualsiasi questione anche solo leggermente spinosa Bersani si limita a frasi di circostanza (""vedremo"",""dobbiamo discuterne con serietà"", bla bla bla) e non prende posizione

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Can you show me some documentation that Swedes lived in Northern Scandinavia before Saami? N

Of course, but I think I have to give you some background on Swedish ancient history first, since it odes not seem to be your forte. So, northern Europe, in particular the Nordic countries were covered in ice, during the last ice age, around 11 000 years ago.  That ice slowly ""disappeared"". You can read about it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period#Wisconsin_glaciation.2C_in_North_America)(scroll down to the Weichselian glaciation). The ice melted from the south. That means, when people followed, they came from the south (since one obviously couldn't live on a several hundred meter thick glacier only). By pure survival/geography, one had to come from the south. It just struck me, that perhaps you do not even know that the Sami people immigrated from the north?  Whether there were people there before the ice age, we will never know. All possible traces disappeared under kilometers of ice. 

Those first people who came, slowly reclaiming the land from the south, were hunter/gathers, and they stayed hunter gather, particularely up north for a long time. When southern Europe were discussing Plato, we were still hunter gatherers mostly. And, when agriculture came, it came for where it actually could work, what is now Scania,Södermanland etc, in south of Sweden - up north the Swedes there stayed hunter gatherers. If you have been to northern Sweden, you can see it is not exactly the most suitable land for growning wheat/potateos  - anything really. Also, like all hunter gatherers, they left fewer traces, and lived in smaller groups etc - that is the same story of hunter gathers everywhere, they don't exactly build cities. However, fewer traces do not mean any traces. I think the oldest archeological evidence from Norrland (which is the part of Sweden where the Sami mostly lives) is from around 7000-8000 years ago, and shows a traditional hunter gatherer society, who later supplements it with agriculture, but perhaps not agriculture in the modern sense. And, what is important to our discussion, those traces, are not Sami. Everything points to, logically, geologically and archelogically that Sweden was populated from the south, but groups of hunter gaterers. These people were not Sami, and of course there a multitides of findings from this, obviusly not just one little stone ax. Also, the findings are over several thousands of years, it is not just one little hunter strolling by, people lived and died there for several thousands of years, and they arrrived as soon as it was technically possible, after the ice melted. These people were the forefathers of the Swedes.

At some point, several thousand years later, between 4000-3000 years ago (they do not know when)the Sami arrives. The archeologist can see this too. They were also hunter gatherers, and they had reindeers (but not in the way they have now, they just had 1-2 ""family"" reindeer). So, they came way after the Swedes. What is interesting, is also that the Sami folk tales, talks about the ""storvuxna folket"" - the ""big/tall people"", who were there when they arrived. 

So, as you can see, Swedes were there first. But please, do not take my word for it, here are some links to entertain you. Some of them you might have to run trough Google translate. 

[Link](http://www.popularhistoria.se/artiklar/nya-fynd-skriver-om-norrlands-forntid/). Interesting article in Swedish about the new archeological findings in ""Norrlands inland"" which is the inner part of norhtern Sweden, probably around 2/3 of Sweden actually. He (the professor in archeology) claims they were not the first. However, he(like me) think that is not relevant for the discussion, since if one has been somewhere long enough, they should have rights. [Here](http://www.namforsen.com/default.asp?path=22553&amp;pageid=32598) are some of the people he is referring to btw.

[Here(http://www.tv4.se/sveriges-historia/artiklar/historieprofessorn-dick-harrison-chattade-med-tittarna-4fbfa82104bf725194004efb) is a chat with a famous (in Sweden) professor in history. What I like is this answer to the question  ""Is there anything that supports the claim that the Sami were the first people in Sweden"". He answers  - ""No, nothing"".

[Here is another link that just confirms what I said, that the people came from the south](http://www.solleftea.se/upplevagora/kultur/museergallerierkonst/sollefteamuseum/sollefteahistoria/deforstamanniskorna.4.7a37658d13ab861ebe835d.html)

[Here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00996246?LI=true) is if you would like to bury yourself in the history of stone age northern Scandinavia. This confirms my claim, that the Sami wasn't there first. 

[Here](http://umu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:140134) is another thesis on that fact. 

&gt; Not that it matters, what happened before in the area is not relevant to evaluate the relation between Swedes and Saami, as I explained before.

Oh, so you are now the leading expert of colonization? So, according to *you*, anonymous Frenchmen, on the Internet, all of a sudden colonization has nothing to do with who arrived first, it is all about how people are treated. By that logic, hasn't every single country colonized the Jews? Also, you go against the very definition of colonization. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization). So, you are right, everyone else in the world are wrong? 


&gt;Now you're being disingenuous on purpose. Roman law was canon in Medieval Europe and their concepts were applied everywhere. In particular the practice that Romans had citizen rights, while the conquered people did not, is relevant. Roman cities there were called colonies, eg. Colonia Agrippina (Köln).

Ok, thank you for the history lesson. I am learning Spanish, so I am hoping that my knowledge about the latin languages (as we call it here) will improve. Fail to see the connection to the Swedes/Sami here though.

&gt; Does it upset your black and white worldview?

Me, you are the aggressive one who makes up your own definition of stuff. 

I honestly do not know why you are so hell bent on claiming something that goes against every archeologial finding, what we know about the ice age etc. For the record, I do not in any way dispute that we have treated the Sami people bad - we have. I am just disputing that we are the colonizators (is that a word?) - since we were the first one there.

[No it wasn't](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Portuguese_debt_and_EU_average.png). 2010 was merely when Portugal reached its breaking point because it had been mismanaging a crisis which first showed its symptoms in 2005. The 2009 deficit, in full recovery according to you, was **9.3%**!! 

&gt; Then, during recovery (employment going up, positive GDP growth, debt falling), ratings agencies decided to downrank Portugal to junk.

With good reason, because Portugal's debt rose nearly 20% of the GDP in 2 years time and showed no signs of stabilizing.

&gt; Then came massive austerity - unemployment doubled, return on debt lowered drastically, and no GDP growth is in sight to this day.

Austerity was introduced to keep Portugal's rapidly rising debts under control. It was the lesser evil: austerity and moderate economic consequences starting in 2010 or state bankruptcy and far worse consequences in 3 or 4 years time. Again you keep switching cause and effect around.

&gt; As for the report on expenditure on investment bubbles, let's not kid ourselves into believing that every western economy isn't based on that.

At first most people were thinking that it would be nice (this was around 2008 or so) and that wages would reach the western Europe levels, but now everyone realised that this is just not going to happen.

A sad joke going around is that after the introduction of Euro the prices of the food will be the same (2 for a loaf of bread) but with a Euro sign next to it instead of Litas (so the prices will basically triple). Meanwhile, the wages will remain where they are now.

true,mars20,null,null,"It's interesting how this ""risk of poverty or social exclusion"" is checked (copy paste from the pdf):



Persons at risk of poverty or social exclusion are those falling into at least one of the following three conditions:

•Persons at-risk-of-poverty
live in a household with an equivalised disposable income below the risk-of-poverty threshold,
which is set at **60% of the national median equivalised disposab
le income** (after social transf
ers). The equivalised income
is calculated by **dividing the total household income by its si
ze determined using the following
weights: 1.0 for the first
adult, 0.5 for each other household member aged 14 or
over and 0.3 for each household member aged under 14.**

•Severely materially deprived persons
have living conditions constrained by a
lack of resources and experience at least
4 out of the 9 following deprivat
ion items: cannot afford 1) to pay rent/mort
gage or utility bills on time, 2) to keep home
adequately warm, 3) to face unexpected expenses, 4) to eat m
eat, fish or a protein equivalent every second day, 5) a one
week holiday away from home, 6) a car, 7) a washing machine,
8) a colour TV, or 9) a telephone (including mobile phone).

•People living in households with very low work intensity
are those aged 0-59 who live in households where the adults
aged **18-59 on average worked less than 20% of their total wo
rk potential** during the past year. Students are excluded. 



I marked some parts. These basically put every family with more than two children at risk of poverty, which is quite ridiculous. Also, people who are rich enough to live off their money (or lets say houses) are in risk of poverty as they don't work at least 20% of their work potential. These may not be that much, but it shows how simple this statistic is and how vague it is.

Children at risk of monetary poverty of low education parents in Belgium, Germany, France and Sweden is higher than in Greece, Spain and Portugal according to these statistics.

I don't really trust this statistic to be honest.

To add, i think the comeback of Berlusconi was very much dependent on his continuous appearance on TV.

This kind of exposure was unseen for other candidates, and had an extreme influence on audience, expecially for people unused to the internet or other, independent sources of news, such as elders and uninterested/ignorant adults.

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"&gt; Under the Euro money is created through someone taking on debt.

Nope. Central-bank Euros are generated, out of thin air, by the ECB against security deposits.

If Euros would really be generated by debt, then the ECB (or rather, it's constituting national central banks) would end up owning the whole of Europe, which isn't the case.

If you read German, [here's](http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/AG_Geldordnung_und_Finanzpolitik/Zins) a throughout dissection of the whole topic, [this one](http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/AG_Geldordnung_und_Finanzpolitik/Zins/Zinskritik-Kritik) explicitly addresses the myth of the ""missing money"", which arises from only looking at parts of the whole system.

That's not to say that the system doesn't have fundamental flaws... but being debt-based is none of them, it's in effect a giant zero-sum game for the issuing organisation. Perhaps the most fundamental problem is that of minimal reserve: The capability of licensed banks to only have one cent of actual central-bank Euros for every whole Euro in their books. That is, if you deposit a Euro (as in the coins or notes) on your bank they can lend 100 Euros to someone else (as in the balance on accounts).

That *a bit* of flexibility in the reserve is needed is very likely, but a minimum reserve of 1% is laughable. ",0,1361883785,null,0,1361885868,0,c8lxecy,t3_198s25,t1_c8lxecy,t1_c8lw7vt,null,1431414925,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

di Domenico Ferrara  (Mar, 26/02/2013 - 12:01)


A bocca asciutta. Lo tsunami delle urne ha investito politici eccellenti. E li ha scaraventati fuori dal Parlamento.

Quello che non è riuscito a fare l'invocata rottamazione, alla fine lo hanno fatto gli italiani. La lista dei trombati eccellenti annovera nomi illustri, quantomeno per l'esperienza e per il lungo corso in Transatlantico. 

Uno su tutti **Gianfranco Fini**. Dopo trent'anni, il presidente della Camera è fuori dai giochi. Ma non è l'unico. All'interno del Fli, che ha raggiunto una percentuale da prefisso telefonico (0,4%), anche **Italo Bocchino**, **Fabio Granata**, **Carmelo Briguglio** e **Giulia Bongiorno** spariscono. Passando all'Udc, se da un lato per la legge del miglior perdente (il che è tutto dire) si salva Pier Ferdinando Casini, sorte opposta tocca a **Lorenzo Cesa**, **Rocco Buttiglione**, **Paola Binetti** e **Ferdinando Adornato**.

Infausto destino anche per Rivoluzione Civile di **Antonio Ingroia**. L'ex pm non entra in Parlamento, così come **Ilaria Cucchi**, il dissidente grillino **Giovanni Favia**, l'ex leader Idv **Antonio Di Pietro**, il segretario del Prc **Paolo Ferrero**, quello dei comunisti **Oliviero Diliberto** e il leader dei Verdi **Angelo Bonelli**. Tra le file montiane niente da fare per il giornalista **Mario Sechi** e per l'ex ministro dell'Agricoltura **Mario Catania**.

Esclusioni importanti anche nel Pd - fuori **Paola Concia**, l'ex presidente del Senato **Franco Marini** e **Giorgio Gori** - e nel Pdl - fuori **Amedeo Laboccetta**. Non ce la fa **Guido Crosetto**, tra i fondatori di Fratelli d'Italia, escluso dal Senato. Dalla Camera è rimasto fuori **Gianfranco Micciché**, leader di Grande Sud, e **Raffaele Lombardo**, leader del Mpa (Movimento per le autonomie). Spariscono i **radicali**. Fuori anche **Francesco Storace**. Se c'è chi si lecca le ferite, c'è anche chi invece stappa bottiglie di champagne. Come Antonio Razzi, Domenico Scilipoti e Augusto Minzolini, pronti a entrare in Parlamento.

true,hughk,null,null,"&gt;The reactors are almost as expensive as the solar energy (yes, they get subsides, too - that does not even include the cost of disposing nuclear waste)

Funding for nuclear power is in the form of guaranteed long term loans. This is kind of necessary for private infrastructure projects if you need ten years to build something. The same can happen for big hydroelectric projects.

As for nuclear waste, the biggest issue there is nobody is trying to solve the problem. Whether or not the reactors are to be decommissioned, the existing material requires proper disposal not round trips on ships.

The solar subsidy is different. Essentially it takes money off all consumers to over compensate the production cost of Solar. That is on top of any cheap loans from the KfW (also government guaranteed).

&gt;Also, privatizing the energy grid was a mistake 

I don't think there is a privatised energy grid in Germany or am I wrong now? The issue before was that there were lots of regional utilities, each running their own regional grids plus any interconnects. The UK on the other hand was operated as power generation plus a national grid with regional utility companies reselling the power. Yes, the power generation has been sold off but at least the grid stays as a unit.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; Central-bank Euros are generated, out of thin air, by the ECB against security deposits.

You're going to have to qualify for me what these security deposits are for unfortunately I do not read German.

From all I've been able to see - the ECB's refinancing operations involve the ECB lending against collateral, collateral that represents someone's debt. It doesn't introduce net Euro savings - someone has gone into debt to a bank, and the ECB has lent a suitable amount of money against the collateral that someone has put up.

Nobody has created net Euro savings in this fashion. You borrowed, your bank needed financing to be able to fund your loan, the ECB supplied funds to the interbank lending markets against your collateral which your bank was able to borrow to meet its reserve requirement.

&gt; That is, if you deposit a Euro (as in the coins or notes) on your bank they can lend 100 Euros to someone else.

The money multiplier, as taught, is a myth. In modern monetary systems loans *create* reserves, not vice versa.

That is, when a bank issues a €100 loan to you it puts down in its books both a €100 liability and a €100 deposit in your account. That deposit it has created out of thin-air, but it's allowed to do that - it's a bank. At this point its reserve position has been met by the newly created deposit, there's no issue yet.

If you withdraw that €100 to pay your rent, and your landlord banks with the same bank as you - there's still no drama. The bank has €100 in liabilities matched by the €100 deposit your landlord has made.

If you withdraw that €100 to pay your rent, and your landlord banks somewhere else, your bank ends up down €100 however another bank is now *up* €100. Your bank borrows its reserve requirement *back* from the second bank on the interbank lending markets - and now its reserve position is met.

If you withdraw that €100 and set fire to it, your bank ends up down €100 and no bank appears to be up. No problem, your bank can still borrow its reserve requirement on the interbank lending markets - for the ECB ensures there's always enough money *on* that market such that it's trading at the desired interest rate. It does this by lending to banks against their collateral - the very collateral that you put up in the first place. There can literally never be a shortage of funds on that market, for if there were - the ECB would not be doing its job at maintaining interest rates at target.

Importantly, loans by banks are only ever limited by demand from credit-worthy borrowers as banks can always mark up the interbank lending market rate (which has, in effect, an infinite supply of funds available at a rate the ECB sets) and sell that on to customers.

Generally speaking my method is incentive analysis. Not sure if it is scientific, but it has a certain logic: how incentive chains flow from people who are the most affected by a decision.

I mean riddle me one thing: essentially why would I as a voter have a higher chance of making the big people do what I want than I as a customer? In what sense is the incentive structure in collective voting better than in individual customer choice rewarding the competition? This is literally the cornerstone of my beliefs.

I upvoted you despite a bit of an arrogant start, because this could become an interesting discussion.

Seriously, let's think together step by step and see how it connects with reality, OK?

A) If I am buying a construction project for an employer, be that the government, or a corporation, my personal interests (make money) may not be the same as my employers interets (best quality, lowest price) thus there may be an opportunity for bribery, like accepting 5% higher price for an 1% kickback, so far agree?

B) If I am buying something for myself, then of course I cannot be bribed, clear that? Agreed?

C) So far established that the small entrepreneur is less corruptible than the government employee, right? 

D) The corporate employee is a complicated case. He is not buying for himself so he can be bribed. But the corporation has owners, and has to compete. So it is the best interest of the owners to come up with ways to prevent it. The incentive chain only has two steps, the owners incentivizing the CEO and the CEO the purchasers. A voter has a much longer incentive chain with a government employee and can only work indirectly, by replacing the whole government. 

So our corruption rank should be small entrepreneur &lt; corporate employee &lt; government employee.

E) We have a specific problem if the corporation was formerly state owned, and privatized, that may be the most corrupted deal of them all.  I won't prove this because I think this is something you can easily agree with.

So our final rank is small entrepeneur &lt; corporate employee &lt; government employee running a state owned organization &lt; government employee privatizing a state owned organization.

Thus my recipe that deregulate the small guy, be more cautious about deregulating the big guy, and be extremely cautious about privatization.

Now I think it all is neat and logical. Not sure how scientific it is, but given that a factor-isolating experiment is largely impossible, plus this stuff is logical, I prefer not to get too empirical when stuff can have a million variables I cannot isolate.

These can never be viable solutions to a country with an annual deficit of 9.3%, because they do not lead to structural changes. They would merely lead to even worse problems a decade from now. 

&gt; Portugal had several problems, the ""solution"" only made everything worse like you can see by the numbers i posted, 

Your numbers are worthless because they were achieved by unsustainable deficit spending. Anyone can keep unemployment low by simply creating empty jobs that are paid for by borrowed money. The problem is that you can't keep doing this indefinitely, and thus sooner or later are forced to cut those worthless jobs (a.k.a. austerity).

&gt; More cuts and even higher taxes, because that will certainly bring the unemployment down and boost the economy. 

This isn't about bringing down unemployment and boosting the economy. If you wanted that, you should have started with it a decade ago before your debts rose out of control. The top priority of austerity is to keep these countries from spiraling ever deeper into debt. When that is achieved, the relatively lesser problems of the economy and employment can be tackled.

Austerity is a bit like chemo therapy to the cancer that is uncontrollable debt. It's damn unhealthy for the whole body and might not even cure the cancer, but it sure beats the alternatives.

Portugal lived above its means for a long time. Now it is being reduced to what it actually can afford.

A. It uses two different criteria for the Lower House and the Senate. The party/coalition that gets even one vote more than the others automatically gets 55% of the seats, to ensure governability. However, for  parties get seats in the Senate on a regional basis, meaning that the party that controls the three most populated regions Lombardy, Veneto and Sicily (traditionally the right wing) has a great advantage.
B. The law doesn't allow citizens to choose the representatives, only the party.

2) Parties tend to team up in order to get more votes. Pdl+Lega is a classic, why the left wing usually finds it more difficult to have common points.

No. You have might have an argument that a government employee is more corruptible to the goals of the state as the entrepreneur is to his own objectives. Those objectives are primarily only good in so far as they make that entrepreneur money, it's primarily not connected to any kind of public good, interest of the community.

With C) being flat out wrong, C) and D) rely on the people involved to be rational actors. They are expected to always rationally do what is best for their own interest. Given human nature, this is not a reasonable assumption. People are fucking stupid and short-sighted and often totally unable to plan for any kind of meaningful long-term goal for themselves. Look at the recent banking crisis. How was any of the fraudulent-loans, packaging into bundles, selling etc rational? On what planet?

And of course, people did not actually have to pay the price for their behavior. They were all bailed out, only the small fish went into jail (lying homeowners, a few guys who sold mortgages). Why should they try harder in the future? If we all fuck up, the government comes in with unlimited moneys!

In addition to all that: Have you ever read [""The prince""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince)? It is a book giving advice to an autocratic ruler on how to rule and keep ruling. One of the repeating themes there is pretense. The ruler has to keep an close eye and how he is perceived by people. His actions must not necessarily be in a certain way, it's enough if he can keep up the pretense of it.

On basic every level, resourceful people, in their own self-interest-as-they-see-it will find ways to only pretend to deliver things, to outright cheat,  to lie, to mispresent the truth.

That is why they're harmful to the community and why they need to be limited in the amount of damage they're allowed to do.

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"&gt; From all I've been able to see - the ECB's refinancing operations involve the ECB lending against collateral, collateral that represents someone's debt. 

&gt;  It does this by lending to banks against their collateral - the very collateral that you put up in the first place. 

Collateral that represents something. Like an actual house, or your obligation to pay your bank mortage interest on your house. Should the bank bail on that collateral, *it* loses the right to demand payment from you, but your house doesn't change its owner. You might end up with having a contract with a bank (the ECB is going to sell that collateral), but they aren't going to be able to change the mortage contract without you agreeing, either.

When a bank puts something up for collateral, that doesn't suddenly change underlying property rights. The bank is putting up *their* assets, that is, possibly *your obligation to pay them money* as collateral, but *never* your assets. 

That is, if you don't have a credit, the bank can't put it up as collateral. Those Euros you have in your purse, they're actually yours, you don't owe them.

&gt; for the ECB ensures there's always enough money on that market such that it's trading at the desired interest rate. 

Yep, because it has to, because it can't really control the amount of money in effective circulation, and that's a direct result of the low minimal reserve: Collectively, the banks have the capability to shrink and expand the amount of money available to the rest of the economy.

Actually, in a way yes, because you understood only half of it. I focus my freemarketism on the small business, and consider the big business dangerous, although marginally less so than big government, because they have no geographical monopoly. This is rooted in Distributist movements such as land-to-the-tiller programs. Most folks I know from a similar background are either hugely nationalistic collectivists or the type who would privatize everything to big corps because ""they have the know-how"". So it is pretty unique.

&gt;Those objectives are primarily only good in so far as they make that entrepreneur money, it's primarily not connected to any kind of public good, interest of the community.

I can't promise I can come up with a magic system that straightens out the crooked timber of mankind. But I can minimize damage. Incorporating insights both from libertarians who correctly analyse how political decision making does not have a good incentive structure, which is AFAIK true and was never properly challenged, and from leftie folks who consider great concentrations of property dangerous, I came to the conclusion that the least dangerous thing is the small business because it does the least bad job because it has _the smallest possible gap between someone making a decision vs. the people being affected by those decisions_. Not perfect, but the smallest possible. If you have any other system or method for narrowing that gap, let's hear. 

&gt;They are expected to always rationally do what is best for their own interest. Given human nature, this is not a reasonable assumption. People are fucking stupid and short-sighted and often totally unable to plan for any kind of meaningful long-term

No, I think it is a huge misunderstanding. Humans are stupid, fine, what follows from this? That some good fairy will sort things out? No, only humans can, they have multiple institutions, market, government, NGOs. It can be demonstrated that the incentive mechanisms in government (representative democracy, two-block political systems etc.) are the worst. What gives? That we need to stick to the least bad alternative.

Let me emphasize something:

**It is not about the optimistic belief that free markets with rational actors lead to good outcomes, it is about the pessimistic belief that irrational humans make the least bad decisions if they are most affected by them, and this generally means politics is one of the worst decision mechanisms because it divorces those who make decisions and those who suffer their consequences the most. The market - provided that it is mostly small businesses - is not something ideal, but a pessimistic damage limitation device.** 

&gt;And of course, people did not actually have to pay the price for their behavior. They were all bailed out, only the small fish went into jail (lying homeowners, a few guys who sold mortgages). Why should they try harder in the future? If we all fuck up, the government comes in with unlimited moneys!

And that is of course a critique of governmental intervention. Should people not be bailed out, they would try harder not to be such idiots.  Have you thought it through?

&gt;In addition to all that: Have you ever read ""The prince""? It is a book giving advice to an autocratic ruler on how to rule and keep ruling. One of the repeating themes there is pretense. The ruler has to keep an close eye and how he is perceived by people. His actions must not necessarily be in a certain way, it's enough if he can keep up the pretense of it.

Skimmed it, found a bit rambling. Familiar with the argument mostly.

&gt;On basic every level, resourceful people, in their own self-interest-as-they-see-it will find ways to only pretend to deliver things, to outright cheat, to lie, to mispresent the truth.

Exactly! And this is why we should not put too much power in the hands of resourceful and immoral people. You know where too much power comes from? Either from government or from large concentrations of property. So if the resourceful person is a small business owner the damage that can be done is minimized. We must limit government as priority 1, and we must limit big business as priority 2, but not sacrificing priority 1 for priority 2.

Again let me add some emphasis, because it comes up so often I want more people to see it:

_The most common mistake is too see the government as a magic wish-fulfilling device that does the rational interest of the community. In fact government is **merely a special kind of market where the product sold is power and the currency is popularity and we should analyse its structures like every other market** and when we do it becomes clear it is the worst kind of market._

So what you're saying is the bank is going into debt. They're borrowing against their assets, and no net savings are being introduced.

Tell me then, if households across the EMU decide they want ~100% of GDP in net savings as Euros, say for retirement, how can they acquire that?

How can an entity acquire net Euro savings without putting someone else into debt - or almost equivalently, who within the EMU can acquire a lot of debt, providing savings to others? Because from where I'm sitting, it looks like a sector of the economy just simply cannot acquire a large amount of net savings without another sector acquiring a lot of debt.

In Japan it's obvious how savings can be provided to households - the Japanese government goes deep into yen-denominated debt to provide their frugal risk-adverse households with huge amounts of yen-denominated savings - but who could do the same in the EMU?

In the USA, again, it's obvious - the government acquires a huge amount of USD-denominated debt to supply both households *and* the foreign sector with savings. Who could do the same in the EMU?

&gt; Those Euros you have in your purse, they're actually yours, you don't owe them.

Essentialy its your job to use your head when youre outdoor. You can put up a tent thats more than a 150m from any building and private property. The law differentiate between cultivated and uncultivated land. It is said that the norwegian translation of these two terms are a bit different than the english, so take care to read up. But to put it a simple, if there is any sign of someone using the property for work, recreation or otherwise, then stay away. Norway is basically thinly populated so there shouldnt be much problems as long as you go a bit of the main roads and citys. Here comes the essentials:
""In defining the scope of access rights, the Outdoor Recreation Act distinguishes between “uncultivated land” and “cultivated land” (utmark and innmark in Norwegian). You need to be aware of this distinction when visiting the Norwegian countryside. As a general rule, you can go anywhere you like on foot or on skis on uncultivated land. Access to cultivated land is much more limited.

Cultivated land includes tilled fields, meadows and pasture, but it also means private plots round houses and holiday cabins, farmyards, plantations, and other areas where public access could cause damage or be a nuisance for the owner or user. Small areas of uncultivated land surrounded by tilled fields and meadows or within a fenced area of farmland are also considered to be part of the cultivated area. And the right of access does not apply to areas zoned for industry or other special purposes where public access would cause problems.

Uncultivated land includes all areas that are not farmed and not otherwise classified as cultivated land. In practice, this means most beaches and rocky shorelines, lakes, bogs, heaths, forest and mountain areas throughout Norway. There is more than enough space for everyone to enjoy a varied outdoor life.""",0,1361891495,null,0,false,0,c8lz056,t3_197pmv,t1_c8lz056,t1_c8lxhdl,null,1431415701,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Basically both countries will treat you as if you would have worked there the whole year for the months you worked there to determine your tax rate and you pay 1/12 per month on that.

So let's say you earn 1000/m for 6 months in Germany and 1400/m for 6 months in France. The Germans will look at that and determine that you earn 1000*12 per year and 1/12th of that is being deducted from your monthly pay check during every month that you work there. (6 times total)

When you move to France they will see that you earn 1400/m * 12 and will deduct 1/12th of that for the months that you work there. (6 times total)

So for Germany you earn 12000 per year and for France 16800. 

However in reality you earned 14400 (6 * 1000 + 6 * 1400). 

So in Germany you payed a bit less than you should and in France a bit more. If in total what you payed in taxes is more than you should you can do your taxes next year and declare both amounts (the 12000 and the 16800) in both countries and may get some money back. (And I would just declare it in France and see if I can get away with it. But do that at your own risk)

IIRC, this should be the case as the tax rate is higher in Germany than in France.

""debt"". Yes. A negative number on a balance sheet. And that's necessary! Because if your plus wasn't balanced by a minus somewhere else, you couldn't buy anything for your money, because noone would have an obligation to you. Well, not directly to you, but you're the vehicle for them to cover their obligation towards the whole economy.



When people criticise the ""debt-system"", though, what they're pining for, is compound interest: That it would be inherent in the system that the central bank can acquire everything by perpetuating debt. And that's just not the case. When the central bank collects interest, then they're setting the minimum inflation for the future: The central bank actually has to issue the money it wants to collect.

My comment about the grid is not to say there is no privatised grid, it is that there is no single operator so that each regional energy company has their own local grid and is doing their own thing. The new long North-South lines are also being planned by independent operators. This fragmented approach is pretty hopeless. The UK has a single operator which is now privatised, but they at least still have the remit as well as the benefit of being able to look at things on a national basis.

Apparently there is a call to nationalise the grid in Germany. Perhaps that is an approach and then to sort out the problems, then it may be privatised as a single entity or not.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; But anyway: You save by not spending.

(1) But that's just the [paradox of thrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift).

That's how *I* save, but households in aggregate cannot save in that fashion. You'll just end up with those in safe jobs keeping them, and those without ending on the unemployment stack. Those with safe jobs acquiring net savings, those now unemployed losing theirs. There's no net saving there. Just a damaged economy, running well below its potential.

&gt;would you want to save? What's the use? 

For retirement. What if the country has a risk-adverse aging population like Japan?

Or, purely hypothetical here, what if a massive financial crisis hits the world and outlook for the future, job prospects etc look bleak - would it not be sensible to put aside a few dollars just in case instead of hovering around zero savings? So I do that - I put aside some savings, and so does every other household in the country or monetary union.. but what have we just done? Put our governments into debt.

Now what if the foreign sector had done the same for the preceding decade - what if foreign reserve banks had put aside *trillions*, as reserves. Now what have we done? Households, businesses *and* the foreign sector all with savings.. the governments are now in a *lot* of debt.

What if the market figured that level of government debt to be dangerous? Why, they'd have to somehow stop it increasing - they'd impose austerity. So governments stop their debt from accruing, or at least try to, but households are *still* trying furiously to save because now outlooks look even worse. See (1) for what happens next.

&gt;We're just giving the wrong systemic incentives.

This is true. If keeping public debt down is really important, every country ought offer taxation benefits like Australia. With a [massive taxation incentive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_gearing_(Australia\)#Australia) to leverage property til your eyes bleed, everyone tends to be *negative* of the 0 point. Public debt during the boom times was virtually non existent accordingly.

If every Euro zone member had implemented taxation policies designed to discourage net saving in Euros, to encourage private sector debt as much as is possible, their public debt could have been low today. Well, provided somehow the union also managed to discourage foreigners from holding the Euro. Don't want foreign reserve banks putting us into debt!

But is that really the right way to go about fixing it? To create what some fear may be the world's [largest property bubble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_property_bubble), all because the monetary system doesn't allow saving except in assets?

&gt; And that's necessary! Because if your plus wasn't balanced by a minus somewhere else, you couldn't buy anything for your money, because noone would have an obligation to you.

It may be possible to do safely, yes, I'm not questioning that. But compromising on the protection of the environment is not an option: Even if it were to be allowed, it would be cost-prohibitive to actually implement, because the burden of proof is with the fracker.

true,benderwayoflife,lombardia,,"Sì Grillo ha effettivamente preso voti da quelli che sono in grado di pensare, non dai ""Tifosi"". E mi è parso di capire dalle prime dichiarazioni al telefono che A. Grillo è incredulo e che B. Berlusconi si è ubriacato ( Fonte telefonata a Belpietro su Canale 5 ) e che tutti e tre – anzi quattro compreso Monti – gli schieramenti erano impreparati al risultato. 

Secondo me dal punto di vista collaborazionale ha più senso un PD che cerca l'appoggio di M5S, anche perché se il PD facesse l'occhiolino al PDL si prenderebbe tante dure e pure bestemmie dagli elettori ""Tifosi"" che hanno votato nella prospettiva anti-Berlusconiana, e soprattutto sarebbe una gaffe allucinante visto che, purtroppo, la campagna del PD si è fondata per lo più sull'anti-Berlusconismo. 
Quindi probabilmente si aggiungerà Monti che non vuole mancare alla festa malgrado la pessima figura fatta in tutta Europa, anche se gli Italiani passeranno per i cattivi che non vogliono *donare* soldi per il bene della comunità, e non è detto che non lo siano, ma forse il ragionamento è stato: ""*Basta così, grazie.*""

Sto facendo un po' di considerazioni personali, quindi se risulto fuori discorso o se dico vaccate calciorotatemi all'ingiù e via:

C'è il semestre bianco, il che vuol dire niente ritorno alle urne, anche se Napolitano negli ultimi tempi non ha dato l'idea di essere un'assiduo frequentatore del circolo di lettura della Costituzione domenicale. Questo è probabilmente un male per Grillo, perché nel caso di voto a breve avrebbe quasi certamente ricevuto più consensi, ma se si andrà a votare fra sei mesi, menzionando il minimo sindacale, le persone si saranno rese conto dell'incapacità degli esponenti di M5S – perché sì, non mi aspetto grandi cose – ed ho la sensazione che il movimento potrebbe andare a morire, riportando l'attenzione sui partiti tradizionali e causandoci quindi un grandissimo bruciore di culo se non ci saranno cambiamenti drastici in entrambi gli schieramenti.

Ora ho amici che dicono che Giannino abbia impedito la vittoria totale di Berlusconi con il suo 0,4% circa che è esattamente quello che mancava a Silvio per la camera. Non so, io sono per il pensiero che Giannino abbia magnetizzato tanti voti di persone che altrimenti non si sarebbero recate alle urne, o che comunque non avrebbero votato Berlusconi, perché se dai il voto ad un mini-partito tendenzialmente dovrebbe significare che non avresti comunque dato il voto a lui, preferendo qualcosa di diverso. 

Tornando a Grillo. Se i grillini messi in parlamento fossero seri però si creerebbe una situazione piuttosto stabile, anche migliore di una vittoria schiacciante del centro sinistra molto probabilmente. Non fraintendete: Io odio Grillo, con tutto il cuore. Ho votato PD ma questo non vuol dire che mi piaccia, anche se il mio orientamento è in quella direzione. Supponiamo che i grillini non siano degli incompetenti, quindi.. il PD ha una *vaga* maggioranza, il PDL è l'opposizione, tendenzialmente raccogliendo tutte le boiate di Grillo si può intuire che *sinistra* e M5S siano sulla stessa lunghezza d'onda, o almeno lo sono spiritualmente per quello che il PD dovrebbe essere. Facendo passare leggi acclamate a furor di popolo dovrebbero costringere il PDL ad appoggiarle onde evitare figuracce e conseguenti aggiuntivi cali di voto, ma allo stesso tempo, essendo che forse qualche buon economista può esserci anche nel PDL, i Grillini potrebbero fare da filtro fra le due coalizioni – ripeto ahimè, sempre supponendo che siano dotati di cervello – così evitando cazzate sia da una parte che dall'altra, e reagendo quindi per un bene almeno minimamente comune.

true,Rarehero,EURO,European Union,"You mean Britain would tell Germany to abandon the ""Mittelstand"" and turn employees into slaves?

Why is everybody talking about Germany? Germany is not that different from France, the Benelux or the Scandinavian countries. Germany and France are just the biggest and most influential economies in that complex. All these countries have strong and stable economies, based on skilled workforce and high quality goods. And when it was about time for them to make necessary but painful reforms, they have made these reforms. Like Germany did ten years ago. 

Germany isn't in such a good position because they were sneaky enough to turn the Eurozone into a ""Großdeutschland"". They just have a strong economy. They always had. And Greece, Italiy, Spain and Portugal were always struggling, with and without the Euro. But thanks to the Euro they had access to cheap money. And they had access to the biggest single market of the world. They could have used that. They could have used the cheap money to make the necessary reforms that would have allowed to exploit the single market like northern countries of the Eurozone did. But even with the cheap money they had access to such reforms would have been painful. By for not as painful as they are now, but apparently still painful enough to not tell your voters about the need for such reforms.

true,vertumne,EURO,Slovenia,"It is mind boggling to me as to how you can afford to sound so sure of yourself when you know so little of what is actually going on.

I mean, where do I even start with such a profound display of ignorance, which is even more pernicious because it uses (and abuses) the common sense of a rational homo economicus. Debts must be repaid, after all - you can't live beyond your means. Right? Those lazy, spendthrift southerners ...

I haven't got all day to lead you through this step by step and try to persuade you not to think in this fashion, so I'll try to be brief and hope that you are a rational individual who will take a deeper look into things before he starts spouting of non-sense that benefits exclusively the national elites and nobody else. Not your friends, not your parents, not your children.

Portugal is in the Eurozone. It does not have control over its monetary policy, no control over its currency and no control over its borders. It cannot devalue, it cannot ease, it cannot impose tariffs on any products. Ok? Ok.

So, how does a country get out of debt? It can raise taxes and/or cut spending, right? Raising taxes on the wealthy is politically unfeasible and it also (so they say) puts a strain on growth. Cutting spending is a simple process, by which you just keep your revenue and not spend it on ""frivolous"" things. This revenue is better spent on paying down your debt, right? But where do you get your revenue from in the first place? Taxes and exports, right? So, there must be some economic activity going on in your country for you to get any revenue to pay down the debts. Yes? If there is no economic activity, you can cut your spending down to zero and still don't get any closer to paying down your debts. This is, of course, correct.

So, the only way you can pay off your debts is by raising (or at least sustaining) the levels of your economic activity. Austerity, first of all, lowers the levels of economic activity, which is a proven fact (even the IMF, the main proponent of austerity, admits this, and it admitted this from the beginning - only they miscalculated by *how much* it lowers the levels, they fucked up the multipliers, etc), so in the absence of the private sector raising the levels of economic activity, those levels will go down, and your debt situation can not get any better. Ok. But now you are going to say - at least it won't get worse.

Ok. The debt levels remain stable. You've cut your spending and reduced the level of economic activity in your country. Your unemployment is 25%, your social safety net is gone, your public services are laying off people in droves. Now, let's forget that we're talking about people here (who are apt to start a violent revolution, if they still retain some notion of solidarity and decency, but let's not go there for the moment) - let's just say that we now focus on problems of economy and employment. Because your government cannot go into debt, everything must be done by the private sector.

How do you do this? You can't devalue your currency to boost your exports. The productivity of your private sector cannot compete with German output and any sane individual will just buy German goods, because they are cheaper. You cannot put a tariff on German exports, because you are in the Eurozone. 

So, even though you have stopped spending beyond your means and are using the meager revenue the austerity has left you with to service your remaining debt, your consumers are still buying German products and your current account deficit is rising. Money is leaving your country. Unemployment is rising. Your GDP is falling. Soon, you will not be able to service even those debts that you still have, so there will be more austerity, more unemployment, more destruction of value, and soon your country is going to look like it has lost a war rather than co-operated in a project of pan-European friendship and unity. 

There is nothing you can do as a government, except go and complain to Brussels. And there a fool of a Nemo84 will be standing and saying: ""well, you obviously shouldn't have spent so much ... oh, and by the way, please bail out your banks, because our banks are awfully exposed to their shitty debts.""

Please, people, enlighten yourself with regards to this situation! If you are not in the Euro - stay the fuck out unless you think you can compete with Germany's industry. If you can't, you will get sucked dry. For the GIPSI countries - demand a fiscal union! demand Eurobonds! demand a European sovereign! demand this bullshit austerity to stop and your debt refinanced by the ECB! Or else get out! 25% unemployment is untold misery for generations and a recipe for war. Please! Spread the word and take action!

Similar to everyone else, this guy leaves out all of those that have been out of work so long that they have given up looking. Also, once you hit 40 years old, good luck finding any mainstream jobs.  
  
Another blazing ommission was the ""Mini Job"" which many equate to modern slavery. People are offered mini-jobs at a rate of usually €8 and hour with a maximum earned income of €450 a month income tax free. The intent was to work an amount of hours each month at your hourly rate until you reach €450 for the month. However, there is one catch which I personally believe was intentionally left out by the politicians. Companies can ask you to work more hours after you have reached your €450 limit to be paid back in ""free time"". If you refuse, they find someone who will.  
  
Just as you might have guessed. The ""free time"" never gets approved or paid out.

Bersani has two real options, form a minority government and get support on a case to case basis, or write out a new election.

Since apparently the grillos in sicily vote on whatever they like where ever it's coming from, Bersani could pull option one off, possibly by giving them election reform in return. Grillo himself doesn't want Berlusconi back as PM, and helping out the left on some cases could benefit both. Okay, Grillo doesn't want to support any government, but he could get some stuff done by bargaining with Bersani.

Option two is very, very risky in my view, because the stakes of Berlusconi winning the election are too high right now. IF a new election was to be undertaken, PD will need to run a better campaign and kicking out Bersani for Renzi might help that. It's an option that can be very rewarding, but also extremely punishing.

I think Bersani will look to get election reform through, probably with help from 5 stelle, and then write out a new election having more confidence about getting a majority in both chambers.


Also, it's slightly sad to see Monti lose out this badly. While i kinda wanted him to run, he's not a politician and can't run a campaign.

From above articel:
Subsidies for

 Nuclear power: 187 billion € 

 Coal energy: 177 +65 =242  billion €

 Renewable energy: 54 billion €

The difference to OP's article is that Op's article adds all subsidis that will be paid to all existing solar platns for the next 20 years, the development coast AND the production coast. Wich also includes the amount paid by private investors. Also, the 100 billion is an estimation and 100 is a nice number, and not really trustworthy.

Yes, and they get even more money from the state...

&gt;You better pray that no dam is gonna burst. It will be much worse...

Lol. You have no idea bout physics, medicine or even only recent events in Fukushima. THe damage done by this one incident is far greater than all subsidies in OP's article.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; Greece was going to be in big trouble, regardless of the Euro 

A country cannot ""live beyond its means"" in real terms if it has a free-floating currency and all debt denominated in that currency.

That they cannot run into issue with debt is easy to see: assume the market reasons that the government would sooner print than default. Heck, let's make it part of the country's constitution. That bonds are as safe as the currency they are denominated in.

With that reasoning, bonds will *always* sell for high values. This is because there is zero risk of default by loaning to the government, only a risk of inflation. That risk of inflation is present *no matter who* you lend to, even if you lend to no one at all keeping your savings as cash.

Now over the 10yr period of the bond the interest rate at which banks lend to one another will be altered via the central bank. If a bank reasons over the next 10yrs that the central bank will have it lending drachma at 5% interest to other banks, why would it not purchase a government bond returning 6% interest? It'd be more profitable than leaving its funds on the interbank lending markets at the same period.

Accordingly, *bonds will always have buyers*. Bond yields cannot ever be much higher than expectations of the central bank set interest rates - at some point it even becomes profitable for banks to borrow on the interbank lending markets to buy bonds. The government, through the central bank, effectively sets its own interest rate regardless of how much debt is outstanding.

Japan doesn't have the world's cheapest debt because investors think they'll somehow pay it back with taxes - it has the cheapest debt because investors know the central bank will not be lifting rates in the foreseeable future.

Australia doesn't have higher lending costs to Japan because investors think its low AAA-rated debt is ""higher risk"" - it's because its central bank sets higher rates. Etc.

So Greece, provided it kept its debt denominated in drachmas, could have continued to run deficits. It could have kept on printing bonds, rolling the debt over as required. The *only* reason this model fell down is because Greece does not issue the Euro. This meant holding the bonds risky, and bond yields rose accordingly.",0,1361899431,null,0,1361903509,0,c8m1fft,t3_198s25,t1_c8m1fft,t1_c8lwhny,null,1435578598,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It gives people enough confidence to loan to you at a workable rate. Without that confidence, you can't get loans. Without loans, everything grinds to a halt. Austerity implemented intentionally is far better than the ""austerity"" that would be implemented without it.

The Eurozone is not just Germany!

Sorry if I sound rude (well, I certainly do), but it's really pissing me off! The entire EU was like ""Germany, do somthing! Germany, say somthing! Germany, you are the biggest and most important member of the Eurozone! Do something!"". And Germany was hesitant to do something, because it never wanted such a central role. But now that we are doing something, you don't like what we have to say about the crisis. What did you mean with ""Germany, do something!""? That Merkel opens her purse to buy the PIIGS another five years?

And I have never said that Germany does not have an advantage in the Eurozone. Of course the Eurozone is good for us. But the point is: We did not force the Eurozone to adapt to the our economy. We have adapted our economy to the Eurozone. We have reduced the wages. We have reduced the cost of labor. We have reduced the expenses for social systems. It was painful because we have waited with these reforms way too long. But it has payed off. We have made it more attractive create jobs for skilled German workers and produce high quality goods that we can sell to Eurozone and the world.

What do you think is the biggest single market in the world about? To run an oversized army? To pay for thousands of redundant jobs in civil services? It's about producing goods and services and selling them. The terrible thing that Germany and most countries in northern Europe have done, is to use that single market to produce and sell goods and to adjust their economies to the European single market. And they are not selling goods to the Eurozone, they are also buying goods from the Eurozone. That's how that the entire project has started and what it is about: To make it easier to produce and trade goods in Europe.

Now don't tell me that Greece could not adapt to that. Don't tell me that Greece could not reduce their military to a more reasonable size. Don't tell me that Greece could not reduce the amount of redundant jobs in public services to a more reasonable amount. Don't tell me that Greece has no possible goods that are interesting for market. Don't tell me that Greece could produce more goods. Don't tell me that the Greeks can't be as qualified as the Germans (or the Dutch, or the French) to produce goods that are interesting for anyone.

By the way, do you know which country is the biggest export partner of Greece? Mind you, I'm not talking about selling goods to Greece, but buying goods from Greece. Any idea? Right, it's Germany! In the last ten years Germany as bought almost as much goods from Greece as they have sold to Greece. And I'm sure that they would buy even more if they would just have more to offer. 

I've to admit though that at moment Greece isn't able to do anything of what I just said. These are things that should have happened ten or fifteen years ago. And it won't help to solve crisis.

Rearrange: private net savings = foreign sector savings + public sector savings.

Now, it's the Euro - we know foreign countries have heaps of it in reserve. Accordingly, for the private sector to have savings, the public sector must be in debt. It's the only way the accounting can work out.

If the private sector wants to increase its savings, say due to a massive financial crisis, it has to put the public sector further into debt (or have the foreign sector spend down its reserves - something householders can't really force for this is dependent on the decisions of foreign central banks).

The Euro however doesn't allow the public sector to accrue high debt, for the central bank (until recently) did not intervene in the government bond markets. Accordingly, householders cannot have high savings. We attempt to force public sector deficits down through austerity, capping the amount households can save.

Noi italiani in ogni caso la prenderemo in quel posto come sempre.

- Se il PD si ""allea"" o si mette d'accordo con M5S, allora il M5S dovrá dimostrare le proprie capacitá e responsabilitá. Se tutto andrá bene allora il M5S toglierebbe voti al PD.

- se il PD si allea con PDL (e Monti come immagine di garanzia per l'estero?) fra 2-3 anni si ritorna al voto. Scendere a compromessi con Berlusconi comporterebbe la fine del PD. 
Bisognerebbe trovare un posto per Berlusconi (Pres. Senato?) cosí avrebbe la garanzia di evitarsi i processi e allo stesso tempo avrebbe il motivo principale per tenere in piedi il governo il piú a lungo possibile.

- arriva Napolitano, che se ne frega di tutto e di tutti, indica il programma di governo e chi ne fará parte, saluta e se ne va. 
Una specie di governo tecnico bis. Non so fino a quanto possa servire.

In ogni caso l'accordo del PD con qualsiasi altro partito dovrebbe essere sulla base di un programma di governo condiviso, affinché il governo possa durare a lungo.",0,1361908806,null,0,false,0,c8m4kd6,t3_1996ik,t1_c8m4kd6,t1_c8lxof0,null,1431418396,0,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,0

A hundred years ago Germany was quite new and the term ""German"" still referred to a group of people who shared a common language and culture. Austrians are part of that culture and referred to themselves as such. But with the unified Germany the term ""German"" eventually took on the meaning of ""someone or something from the nation state of Germany"". And of course that does not include Austria anymore, they're not German in the modern sense.

And another find: very interesting piece in this (German again): http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CD0QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rainerdoerry.de%2FLiteratur%2FBuecher%2FNiedersachsen%2FBraunschweiger-Truppen-in-NA%2FDie-Braunschweigischen-Truppen-in-Nordamerika-1776-1783.xls&amp;ei=7BYtUeCqBY7jtQby24CIAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_mWVQGKoVWOSBgJQBfBzPanYhEw&amp;bvm=bv.42965579,d.Yms

Here, it is made quite clear that due to its connection to England from the war, and a subsequent treaty between England, Hessen-Kassel and Brunswick to defend against France, it was made sure they would support England against France in North America. The duke would have sent troops if England asked (also, he was skint and could have used the money). 

But again: all this is based on a few initial guesses and only holds up if they are correct. 

And yes, Saxony is a totally different kingdom - so this might just be a mistake/omission; see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxony#Regional_history_prior_to_foundation_of_Lower_Saxony

true,nobb,null,null,"&gt;I know France isn't exactly known for science compared to their neighbors(?)

that a common misconception. France is quite good in science (and french researcher have a totally fine reputation, in part because of how phd work here), but foreign student generally dismiss the country because of the shanghai ranking, wich isn't adapted to France.

&gt;however is there a field that I could major in to make me stand out? Math? Physics? Geology? What is in demand or for science in France or is this route even worse than others?

hard to say like that, tough Math and physics always open door if you're good at them. I guess informatics is also a relatively safe bet, and the trend seem to be in interdisciplinary stuff this days (like bio physique, computational biology, ect ...). but mostly you should work something that you like doing. research is a hard work that call for a lot of hours of work, so actually enjoying what you do will keep you from getting insane.

&gt;how does it change with a master's degree in science? What about scientific research?

actually, in france thing are a bit different, if you want to be engineer, you should consider engineer school, wich will bring you the most chance to have a job. if you want to be a researcher, then university is fine (althougth you can also go with an engineer school, university cost a lot less)

I'm not too versed in the engineer path, but I can speak a little about science. in France, after a master, you do a 3 year Ph.D which is paid (in hard science anyway). there is many kind of grant, and some are targeted to foreigner, but the most common is the government one, which will pay 1300 euro /month after tax, with the possibility to compliment it with a ""mission"" (generally doing some teaching or menial job for the university) for an extra 300 after tax.

 once you have your Ph.D, if you want to stay in academics, you have to do one or two post doc, and it's adviced to do at least one of them in a foreign country. post doc are short research job between six month and 3 year long (generally two year).

once you have published enougth article in your post doc, then you can candidate for a permanent post in france. there is different type of post, mainly ""maitre de conference"" kind of like lecturer, you have to spend half your time teaching and ""chargé de recherche"" which allow you to work full time on research. note that post in France are actually permanent, as you work for the state, which allow you to get a credit for example. on the other hand, you should know that even if you win the competition to get a post, you will necessary be able to go in the lab of your choice.

You should know that this kind of scientific career is the norm, not a French exception, except the fact that the Ph.d is nicer, and your post is permanent. 

oh, and also, I fear that speaking French is necessary for both uni and engineer school (and life in general in France) although it's possible to only speak English for your Ph.D.

&gt;I feel this is my only real way of having the opportunity to move to France, through science so I need feedback. I'm in my 20s and trying to figure out how to make this work, thank you.  

If you really want to move to France, I would advised to spent some of your study here, either the master of the Ph.D. French nationality aren't necessary for this, and it should allow you to get a good idea of life in France. it will also be the occasion to learn some French and marry some girl, both of which should help you to stay in France.",0,1361912377,null,0,false,0,c8m5ud3,t3_199ztf,t1_c8m5ud3,t3_199ztf,null,1431418996,4,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,4

Happiness, sadness, boredom, excitement, displeasure, pain, anger, love, compassion, ect Those things blow any feeling I have towards my countries out of the water. The feeling I have of British and I remind you it is an overly inflated feeling compared to most, is about as subtle as looking at a map seeing the UK, England, Europe as the place I come from; it's as sublte as being in an English town and feeling more at home and more comfortable than being in a Russian town. Nationalism or a feeling of national identity isn't some thing you really notice you feel unless you've identified it and can pick it apart from other things you feel which is a very precise task. For many it is as subtle as saying ""I am Scottish"". Why would you say you're Scottish, if you don't feel Scottish. it's up to you what you define yourself as. You choose to define yourself as scottish. If you choose to define yourself as Scottish based on your definition of what being a member of a nationality is, that still counts. That's still partly based on feeling.

Don't choose your science field solely based on demand. If you go in the research path, you will be doing maybe your whole life so better be really interested in. I thought that genetic will be a good field, now I am doing population genetics because I think it's more fun and you can work on the field (free trip yay!).

As for working visa, I think it's different if you are in research as you will come for a PhD. You will need to present it to a ""école doctorale"" and get a grant. So I think it's different from a classic CDI or CDD.

When he says ""a normal job in Italy pays around 1100€/month"" he's talking about the paycheck after taxes are already subtracted (most of the time the employer pays them for you). So, since a normal salary is about 2000€ before taxes, 1100ish after taxes seems normal.

Also, when you look at that tax table you used to pull out the ""43% after 75000"" figure: it's true. But that's just the IRPEF tax (the main tax every resident pays on the total income of his/her family).  
That does NOT include the % you pay to the welfare system (INPS) which if I remember correctly fluctuates around 25-30%.

So, yeah, the average of ALL taxes including welfare is probably close to 45% for most people.

Edit: I also forgot to add this useful piece of info: many contracts in Italy involve 13 or 14 ""monthly"" paychecks per year (the 13th gets delivered as a bonus in December, the 14th can be delivered as a bonus in July). So many Italians make the mistake of NOT considering those 1-2 extra paychecks per year when talking about what they are actually earning.

Edit #2: I also forgot to add this other useful piece of info: part of the paycheck gets ""stored and delayed"" for when you quit your job or are fired (it's called TFR), which effectively amounts to a 14th or 15th ""monthly paycheck"" (except it will get delivered all at once when you stop working for that employer).

true,bluebottled,EURO,European Union,"I'm sad to see that so many people here are pro-Austerity. 

Italy is the first country to acknowledge reality. 

Reality is that unfettered capitalism failed and the debts incurred from that failure were deliberately and successfully transferred to national governments, while the blame was placed on the social democratic values/systems which are the single most important thing Europe has in common beyond simple geography.

Another, uncomfortable, reality is that the countries who are having austerity forced on them by external powers have a pretty powerful ace up their sleeves which those external powers are eventually going to have to acknowledge: the threat of mutually assured destruction. The austerity and bailouts primary aims are not a return to economic growth. The primary goal is/was a nationalisation of unsustainable and irresponsible debt incurred by domestic banksters to ensure the continued 'success' of the irresponsible foreign banksters who loaned it.

Yes, austerity is needed in Europe, but the primary, and currently only, victims of it are people who had no hand whatsoever in creating the crisis. 

There is no way to completely eliminate austerity, but those responsible should bear the brunt of the pain they have created. Instead they are being sheltered by their mouthpieces in the press and friends/future employees in politics.

For the most part, people aren't stupid. They know they have other options than servicing debt that doesn't belong to them. That's why fringe parties are gaining popularity all across Europe. It almost doesn't matter what causes they champion, the important point is that the traditionally powerful parties have lied and refuse to even consider any alternatives to the failed form of capitalism our governments are so desperately trying to preserve.

I suspect, and hope, we will see many more elections like this one before the crisis is over.

And regarding the 'banksters' stuff, yeah banks are at fault a lot. But don't overlook other agents. The Greek government being one:
&gt;Public sector wages, for example, rose 50% between 1999 and 2007 - far faster than in most other eurozone countries. The government also ran up big debts paying for the 2004 Athens Olympics. And while money flowed out of the government's coffers, its income was hit by widespread tax evasion. So, after years of overspending, its budget deficit - the difference between spending and income - spiralled out of control. Moreover, much of the borrowing was concealed, as successive Greek governments sought to meet the 3%-of-GDP cap on borrowing that is required of members of the euro.

true,Mettwurstkaninchen,null,null,"- Es wird Verhandlungen zwischen Google (&amp;anderen Suchmaschinen) und den Verlagen geben.
- Google könnte Google News für Deutschland einstellen. Das Ding hat keine Werbung, ist für Google jetzt nicht so wichtig und zahlen werden die dafür wohl nichts.
- Bei den Suchergebnissen hat Google die besseren Karten. Schon alleine die Drohung mit einer Auslistung wird die Verlage auf Linie bringen.
- Problematisch wird das ganze für kleinere Aggregatoren wie Rivva, 10000flies, Commentarist &amp; Co. Diese haben jetzt schon Probleme sich zu finanzieren und könnten sich die Abgaben wohl nicht leisten. Weiteres Problem: Sie haben auch nicht das Gewicht oder die Rechtsabteilung von Google, um sich gegen die Forderungen der Verlage zu wehren. Wahrscheinlich ist, dass einige von ihnen daher den Dienst einstellen.
- Es bricht eine Periode der Rechtsunsicherheit aus, in der ein Haufen windiger Rechtsanwälte gute Geschäfte mit Abmahnungen machen.
- Tendenziell dürfte es noch schwieriger werden, in Deutschland Webdienste zu entwickeln. Eine Seite wie Reddit wäre etwa in Deutschland nur schwer zu betreiben (etwa aufgrund von Forenhaftung, Abmahnungen). Ein LSR würde auch hier weitere Kosten verursachen, weswegen entsprechende Seiten in Zukunft verstärkt außerhalb DEs entwickelt werden.
- Parallel dazu: Es wird eine Konzentration auf dem Markt geben, da für entsprechende Dienste schnell viel Kapital nötig sein wird. Der Hobbyist, der etwa eine tägliche oder wöchentliche Presseschau über sein Steckenpferd bloggt, wird damit vom Markt getrieben.
- Die Verlage bekommen eine Finanzspritze. Es ist nur schwer zu sagen, wie groß diese sein wird und wer sie bekommt. Zu befürchten ist eine Konzentration - Seiten wie SPON, Bild &amp; Co, welche bereits jetzt viel gelesen und verlinkt werden, dürften deutlich mehr bekommen als kleinere Zeitungen. Auch hier könnte es die Pressekonzentration fördern.
- Die Journalisten selbst werden wenig Verbesserungen sehen. Es ist nicht anzunehmen, dass Bezahlung, Stellenabbau oder die Ausbeutung freier Mitarbeiter durch das LSR verbessert würden.",0,1361926438,null,0,false,0,c8matyh,t3_199k03,t1_c8matyh,t3_199k03,null,1431421363,4,false,de,t5_22i0,4

true,bluebottled,EURO,European Union,"To be honest, I don't think the distinction between the Greek government, or rather Greek politicians, and bankers is necessary. Many parties who were in opposition capitalised on the crisis by blaming the other side's for borrowing. But that is pure and simple spin.

The idea that governments should borrow money at every available opportunity was dogma across the western world. No matter who was in power or where, it would have happened. Due to interest, government borrowing is in essence a direct subsidising of the financial industry. Probably more importantly, it is, or at least was, also a method for governments to either increase spending or cut taxes (depending on ideology) with no political cost.

The right wing in Europe has successfully spread the propoganda that the excessive borrowing was to fund social spending because there wasn't actually 'enough money' in the budget. That is a fallacy, and anyone who believes it doesn't understand that taxation, or lack thereof, is equally to blame.

So yes, I do hope there are more elections like this one. Today I actually found a party that I would vote for if it were organised in my country.

If you're not familiar with accounting terms, ""net savings"" = private sector deposits exceeding their liabilities. In a money as debt system, the only way the private sector can have deposits exceeding their liabilities is if the rest of the economy has liabilities exceeding their deposits.

That is, for the private sector to have $20tn in net savings, the (public + foreign) must be $20tn in net debt. Unfortunately the foreign sector also has savings in the order of trillions in foreign reserve banks, meaning the public sector *has to be in debt*.

And no, there's a difference here. A referendum on the EU membership and a referendum on Euro membership are two entirely different things. If Greece, for example, wanted to leave the European Union, fine on them. If they wanted to leave the Euro but retain EU membership, then I'd have a problem, because they'd be endangering the currency for the members who are committed to it. I think that every member of the EU should eventually adopt the Euro. I don't think that every European country should have to join the EU. I would welcome a referendum on EU membership in any country that desires it, but a referendum on whether or not to use a currency gets into a more detailed issue that isn't suiting to direct democracy.

My feeling is that the Germans aren't as proud of their arms industry as, say, the Americans are. They don't feel comfortable about the fact that they export tanks to the Saudis, where as the USA has no such qualms.

I can imagine US parents wouldn't mind if little Jimmy said his school class were going to visit the Lockheed plant, but it would raise eyebrows if Vroni's *Grundschuleklasse* would go and visit Krauss-Maffei.

The language issue is also a big deal - your least-educated Germans will probably speak more polished German than many Swiss people; ""high German"" is spoken in Swiss schools, but most Swiss people still have a fucking horrible flat accent.

**Le dormeur du val - Arthur Rimbaud**


    C'est un trou de verdure où chante une rivière
    Accrochant follement aux herbes des haillons
    D'argent; où le soleil de la montagne fière,
    Luit; C'est un petit val qui mousse de rayons.


    Un soldat jeune bouche ouverte, tête nue,
    Et la nuque baignant dans le frais cresson bleu,
    Dort; il est étendu dans l'herbe, sous la nue,
    Pale dans son lit vert où la lumière pleut.


    Les pieds dans les glaïeuls, il dort. Souriant comme 
    Sourirait un enfant malade, il fait un somme:
    Nature, berce-le chaudement: il a froid.


    Les parfums ne font plus frissonner sa narine;
    Il dort dans le soleil, la main sur sa poitrine
    Tranquille. Il a deux trous rouges au coté droit.

&gt; Let's put things in perspective. The article compares figures from 1995 and 2011/2012. Basically it says that 2.3 million more people earn less then 9.15 euro/hour. Considering that in 1995 the working population was about 3.3 million smaller (37.7 million in 1995 compared to 41 million now), it means that the German economy not only kept the jobs without decreasing the salaries, but it added 1 million jobs paid better than 9.15 euro/hour and 2.3 million jobs paid less than 9.15 euro/hour. 

&gt; Who are these people? Well, my guess is that most of them are immigrants (many of them still in the integration process - learning the language, acquiring a qualification). So I find it normal that two thirds are not earning a fortune.

&gt; On a macroeconomic level, the GDP/capita (PPP) increased every year. I found data only starting 1999, when it was $22,700. In 2010 it reached $35,700. Not bad, I would say.

This is relevant because of the debate about including Turkey as part of Europe and the possibility of the country joining the EU in the future.  If we accept that there is no objective physical distinction between Europe and Asia, or at least no more than there is between smaller areas of both continents, then the argument that Turkey isn't European becomes far weaker.  Culturally, Turkey is arguably more European than Asian, and if they do eventually join the EU, can we really say that Europe stops at the Bosphorus?

true,TheMania,null,null,"Of course, if the government's spending becomes inflationary it becomes an issue. At that point an increase in taxes are required, or a decrease in spending. That's the whole thing - currency-issuing governments are never revenue constrained, they are only ever constrained by the inflationary impact of their budgets.

The important thing to realise is that at no point is the government in a position where it has to leave hundreds of thousands of people unemployed, many of them looking to emigrate due to a shortage of spending and therefore jobs.

The government can simply print bonds and employ people. Those people employed take their newfound wages to the private sector to buy goods/services, the private sector expands and it's out of recession. The private sector only starts putting up prices once they have no more capacity to expand - if they try it sooner, their competitors will expand and they lose business.

Hence when there's a massive output gap, ie Greece today, the Greece government with its own drachma could have reduced it to nothing in the same way banks normally do in boom-times. There's no need of a shortage of money, a shortage of spending, to lead to high unemployment in a recession if you have retained monetary sovereignty.

It's best thought of as taxes create unemployment which spending solves. If taxes are too high for the level of spending, unemployment rises. If spending is too high for what the economy can support, you get inflation. The important thing is getting it right - under the EMU though, you are severely restricted in options. You can end up in a situation where governments can't spend, and unemployment must rise. Where a shortage of money, a resource we have invented, leads governments unable to make use of the real resources such as willing labour available to them. Where it must lead them idle, causing growth to stall - or, more commonly - reverse.

[Warren Mosler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Mosler) puts it best:

&gt; Let me remind that without govt, in a non monetary society there is no unemployment (as we define it).  

&gt; A currency like the dollar is a simple, coersive, public monopoly, and the introduction of any monopoly is a 'distortion'

&gt; That is, the thing needed to pay taxes ultimately comes only from govt (or its designated agents) spending and/or lending. 

&gt; In this case the currency itself is the cause of unemployment. Specifically, a tax causes unemployment (as defined), and spending causes the unemployed to be hired, etc. to the point where there are no more unemployed.  

&gt; I say it this way- unemployment is the evidence that govt spending and/or lending is insufficient to allow the economy to pay its taxes and net save as desired.

The high unemployment destroying Europe today is simply a shortage of money. Governments taxing too high for the level of spending, resulting in the vain attempts of households to save money leading to unemployment. Unfortunately those governments have no choice, for the only issuer of the Euro is a bank - a bank that currently is lending out an insufficient amount for full employment. Not that the ECB can do much about that - there's an insufficient demand from borrowers for loans due to the sorry state of the economy that austerity does nothing to improve.

The reality is that the dual goals of price stability and full employment can only be maintained with a currency-issuer that is considerably more flexible than a bank. The EMU does not offer this, it is a deficient monetary system and the cause of the economic decline so many countries are experiencing right now.",0,1361959905,null,0,1361960139,0,c8mixp5,t3_198s25,t1_c8mixp5,t1_c8mitkn,null,1431425279,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

A mini-explanation: basically we needed to avoid instability, to start making reforms. Our economy is suffering and, in my opinion, we need to modernize our society and become more dynamic. But, to do that, we need a strong government, since those are gonna be big changes. 

Grillo's movement was the big shock in these elections. I'm not hostile to it, but it still certainly represents a big unknown, so the stability right now is a dream. As a result, the other countries are (understandably) worried, since the whole Europe will be at risk if Italy collapses.

My disappointment came, first of all, from Berlusconi still being able to gather so many votes. For some reason i can see why many voters still like him: i am an italian too, and i know we are fascinated by strong charismatic leaders who makes us feel ""safe"". Add to that the facts that he's a very successful entrepreneur (something that many Italians would like to be), he's very sly (something that many Italians are) and has a larger-than-life personality that makes him look like a regular person, instead of a obscure politician.

That said, i can't really see how people can still vote someone who:

* is a symbol or moral/economical corruption
* has been in an enormous number of scandals
* defends tax evaders
* has employed in his house a guy heavily involved with the mafia
* has in his party people suspected of relationships with the mafia
* is considered a joke abroad
* ...

What scares the Fed is that a lot of dollars are sloshing around outside America, even worse a lot in cash. A Russian friend once joked to me in the nineties that they no longer needed ICBMs, all they had to do was to swap their dollars for deutchemarks.  This makes it very difficult to manage currency stability so it is in the Fed's interest that there is more than one reserve currency even if it eats into their [seniorage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage).

&gt;The UK elite wants to break the euro because if they do not join it, Frankfurt is going to supersede London as the World Trade Centre.

Speaking as a Brit who has extensively worked in the banking industry in Frankfurt, this is very unlikely. The closest thing is if they force the clearing of Eurozone government bonds through clearing houses in the Eurozone. Whilst the UK remains in the EU, financial institutions established and regulated in London can have the rights to conduct their business anywhere in Europe without additional regulation, the called ""Investment Banking Passport"".

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt;How willing do you thing creditors would be to give loans in a currency that at this point would've been proven to be strategically used to avoid paying back loans?

Government bonds are always the safest investment you can make in any given currency, despite that governments all around the world have rolled over debt for decades.

&gt; Even if they did, the interest rates would be through the roof.

Again, no they wouldn't be. The central bank ensures that banks lend to one another at a rate of its choosing. It is rational for any bank to buy bonds today if bond yields are the slightest bit above their expectations for central bank set interest rate over the same period. In effect, the government, through the central bank, sets its own interest rate on its bonds.

&gt; The risk of inflation is by no means the same for all currencies. It really depends on who controls that currency. The risk of the Euro inflating is a hell of a lot lower than the risk of the drachma was.

If you have drachma to invest, the safest place you can put it is with the Greek government that issues the drachma - even if the drachma is undergoing inflation.

If you leave it as cash, it'll devalue. If you leave it with any other company, household mortage, etc - it'll devalue *and* there'll be a risk of default. This is why you regularly see governments be lent money for negative real interest when expectations for central bank set interest rates are low. They're the safest possible store of value in that currency.

OK you think, you'll merely ""convert"" your drachma to Euros, for it'll be safer. Euros aren't inflating you figure. Remember though: currencies are not converted. They are *exchanged*. To be able to buy those Euros you had to find a seller of Euros that desired drachma instead. And where better for that buyer to invest their newly purchased drachmas than with the government that issues them?

Absolute worst case: Greece runs a trade surplus as foreign holders of drachmas spend down their reserves due to uncertainty. Greece then becomes self-funding, with the Greeks, or at least their banks, buying bonds as they're issued. There can never be a shortage of money to buy these bonds, for bond issuance does not remove money from circulation, it merely moves it around.

The reality of it is this: no government with its own free-floating currency has *ever* had difficulty issuing bonds, regardless of its debt position. Japan pushes this theory more than any other nation - over double the debt of when bond yields moved unfavourably against Greece, yet it still sees the cheapest lending of any government in the world despite that there is zero chance of this debt ever being paid back by taxation revenue.",0,1361962841,null,0,1361963086,0,c8mj839,t3_198s25,t1_c8mj839,t1_c8mj1xy,null,1431425411,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Presumably, Italy leaving the euro would have an effect on the Italian economy. The exchange to a new lira would have quite an effect before it would even happen. The only way it would make sense would be if it would come with a significant devaluation, and in anticipation to this, there would be capital flight. Savers would move their savings out of Italy to avoid an instant loss of X%. If you sold your house, business or other immovable assets before the devaluation to move the cash elsewhere, this devaluation would be your gain relative to keeping your assets in Italy.  
Businesses have contracts with companies elsewhere, e.g., for parts the highly industrialized North needs for manufacturing, and those contracts are in euros. They'd also need to pay for energy and other imports (oil, gas, other natural resources, raw materials, etc.) in either dollars or euros.

Then there are the effects of the default itself. The majority of Italian debt is held domestically by Italian banks, insurances and retirement funds/savers, well over a trillion euros in total. Those banks are needed to provide credit to Italian companies that want to expand (i.e., create jobs), which often involves importing machines from elsewhere, but there wouldn't be much left of the Italian financial sector after such a move.

And this doesn't even take the political effects into consideration, or the economic effects such a move would have on the rest of Europe, where many of Italy's customers are.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This defeat was actually predictacle in my opinion. The French generals expected a war of trenches just like WW1 and based all their strategy on that, blind to the fact war had actually evolved a lot. 

The second world war was a very mobile war where tanks were kings. The French had very good tanks, better even than the German ones but they were only seen as a support for infantry and therefore were attached individually to infantry regiments. 

German general saw the benefits of tank only divisions and launched its tanks by the hundreds on one point and the French infantry divisions with the few tanks that were attached to them for support purposes just could not face that. 

The Maginot line (the French line of fortifications facing the German border) also induced a sense of security which led the generals to be complacent with the defense as the Maginot line was supposed to do the job. They also overseen the fact that German armies could actually cross the Belgian Ardennes (a very hilly part of Belgian which had the reputation of not being passable with a modern army).

Basically it is really a French defeat rather than a German victory. French generals were just not ready and really messed up.

The saddest thing maybe was that French troops really did put up a fight contrary to popular belief and in lots of cases with lots of bravery against overwhelming odds. 

It is estimated that the invasion of France cost the German about a quarter of their tanks and a third of their aircrafts (the French had really really good aircrafts and pilots) and that Germany never successfully recovered these losses. This leading some historians to think that the victory of the British Royal Air Force in the battle of England (the huge RAF - Luftwaffe battle over the channel that ended with most of the German aircrafts being destroyed, causing Germany to never have the domination of the skies again until the end of the war) is in part owed to the losses taken by German army during the invasion of France.",0,1361964502,null,0,false,0,c8mjdyj,t3_19a0kd,t1_c8mjdyj,t1_c8m9557,null,1431425476,7,false,Frenchhistory,t5_2ugvv,7
true,Causative,null,null,"From wikipedia: ""Supporters of austerity predict that under expansionary fiscal contraction (EFC), a major reduction in government spending can change future expectations about taxes and government spending, encouraging private consumption and resulting in overall economic expansion.""
Basically - if we cut government spending, government won't need as much money, so we should eventually pay less taxes. 
This is great news for people with possibilities and money, bad news for people stuck with few possibilities and no money. The question has always been - where do we draw the line with social programs? Too much and people get lazy relying on government too much. Too little and people fall into poverty and crime rises. If wealth ends up in the hands of only a few - those few are going to get resented and eventually attacked by the many. (The reason that occupy wall street isn't a nationwide protest is because wealth is still spread out enough.) From the other side if wealth is spread evenly over everyone then there is no motivation to work any harder either because the system then just taxes you back to everyone elses level.
But back to your question - Austerity is a quick tool to cut the fat off of social programs which shows quick returns in government expenditure.

true,G_Morgan,WALE,Wales,"The original core austerity argument was based upon fiscal multipliers. Essentially there are two relevant multipliers on fiscal action:

1. How big an economic hit is caused by reduced state spending.

2. How big an economic boost would be caused by stimulus.

It is very simple. If both of these numbers are small then austerity is a good policy. If both of these numbers are big then stimulus is the better policy. The assumption was they would be small. In the US where they've run stimulus the second figure has demonstrated to be much larger than expectations. In the UK where we ran austerity (for a year at least) the first figure also turned out to be much bigger. In short the basic assumptions behind austerity have been blown out of the water by figures in the real world. They assumed &lt;X. In reality it was measured &gt;X. The argument is dead and the group of economists behind it have already apologised publicly. The wonders of policy with a straight forward scientific criteria on which you can judge success. Especially in the otherwise tricky field of economics. The Americans have matched UK deficit reductions. Despite them spending wildly while the UK cut quite sharply at the beginning.

The second big concept in the UK was that it would stimulate spending. Businesses would increase borrowing in anticipation of future tax cuts. Essentially by getting our house in order businesses would have lower long term overheads so could justify greater expenditure via borrowing today. This hasn't materialised. Mainly because the banks have been forced to hold greater reserves post 2008. So the money to borrow simply isn't there.

The matter is a bit more complex: first, it is true that many Bersani's voters would frown upon an agreement with the center-right, but a significant portion of the center-left constituency would be way unhappy as well in the wake of an alliance with Beppe Grillo (who is seen by many people on the left as a modern times fascist and nothing more).

More poignantly, the decision about the nature of the next parliamentary majority (and therefore the nature of the next government) does not lie in Bersani's hands (nor in the hands of any other political leader, by the way) and pleasing one's voters is far from everybody's mind. What Italy is to provide at any costs is a stable government, and a Bersani-Grillo cabinet with the little majority in the upper House provided by Pd and M5S combined is anything but stable. The famous international financial community fears Grillo way more than it fears Berlusconi. Look at what each and every prominent foreign figure said in the last 48 hours: ""Italy needs a stable government to carry on the reforms"". Now, there is clearly no way anybody is thinking that Grillo can be the stabilizing factor in this political frame.

The problem I'm seeing is that the so-called ""austerity measures"" only affect individuals.

* Business-related revenue streams never go up, because businesses will find always find optimal ways to avoid paying anything. I can't blame them.

* Inefficient banks are not punished: they are bailed out. Banks who do unprofitable business are not weeded out. Thus bad practices are rewarded and continue to be a drain on the system.

Ich würde meinen Arsch verwetten, dass der Kinobesitzer eher die Polizei ruft als dir oder gar mehreren Leuten das Geld für die Vorstellung zurück zu geben. Ich habe schon öfter pöbelnde Menschen in Kinovorstellungen miterlebt und sie sind immer geflogen. Versetz dich doch mal in die Rolle der Schauspieler in deiner Geschichte bevor du sie postest. Warum sollte der Kinobesitzer die Typen da sitzen lassen? Damit die ihm dann in nem leeren Kino alles zerlegen? Was ist das den für eine hirnlose Theorie?

Abgesehen davon würdest du einen ""Zigeuner"" in den meisten Fällen nicht einmal als solchen erkennen. Es ist ja nicht so als würden die immer ihre bunten Kutschen um die Ecke geparkt haben.

Das, liebe Mitredditorse ist dieser Stammtischrassismus von dem ""man"" immer redet. Etwas Vorurteile hier, etwas ausgedachter Blödsinn da gemischt mit einem Standartproblem welches jeder kennt: ""Störer im Kino"".

As far as I'm aware, one of the main reasons behind imposing austerity on the European nations has been to appease the markets and their lenders.

Which makes sense since the whole structure behind the expansive financial policies led by most pre-crisis governments was based on an (almost) unshakable faith in the national governments ability to repay whatever they loaned. This gave very low interest rates that consequently made it possible to fund expansive financial policies. 

During the crisis faith was lost and interest rates rose. And as a reaction to this, governments are now trying to prove that they can 'run a healthy business' and maintain a reasonable balance between income and expenditures.

While it might be frustrating to have a government implementing policies to satisfy foreign investors and not their own populace, I think people all to quickly forget that it's the same investors who have previously helped fund our welfare societies with their loans. *So the current austerity is actually meant to ensure the next decades of economically expansive policies*.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"If the breakup of the euro was beneficial to all then I think we'd have done it when Greece was about to hold a referendum on it. That led to discussion about it, but they wholly predicted bad things for everyone. The Euro allows Europe to compete at the apex of the world economy like never before. I think the issue is that it was too much too soon. Germany initially proposed a more close-knit euro, but of only the stronger economies (France, GB, NL etc.). That would've been better because those countries were much closer economically and thus could forge a much stronger union together. But that's not the situation we are in, and we can only beat what's in front of us.

The idea of it being too much too soon I think is evident through attitudes to the eurozone crisis. Helping Greece requires weakening the German economy. Germany is understandably opposed to that. The German-Greek bond is not strong enough for that policy. Compare that to reunification, which too was achieved by weakening the West German economy. That was done without opposition. And of course it was, we non-Germans can only imagine how horrid it must've been to be separated from your compatriots (and family) for so long. The point I'm trying to make if that whilst European integration is a good concept, Europe itself isn't personally close enough to make sacrifices like is proposed for Greece.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  I'd like some reasoned arguments about why the tactics being employed in Ireland, Spain, Greece, Britain etc. are exactly what they should be doing and the continued contractions of the economy are just necessary pains.

Let's leave the UK aside, it's not comparable to the others. Not that they're all the same, but at least they have in common that they don't have their own currency.

There are two aspects of the austerity policy. One is a reduction of spending, the other is a lack of funding, and they obviously go hand in hand -- since those countries (not Spain and Italy, though) are effectively cut off from private sector funding, the amount they have to cut their expenses by is a directly related to the rest of the Eurozone's willingness to provide them with funding. It's really more about political considerations of the donor countries than it is about economic considerations for those in trouble.

Another way to look at it is kinda like the old ""glass half empty / glass half full"" thing. Without outside public funding, the glass would be empty; now the people in the core countries point at how much they've put in there, and those in the periphery focus at how much is still missing. The former compare the situation to how it would have been without the bailouts, and the latter to how it used to be before the contraction. Is it the austerity the cause of the problems, or does the bailout reduce the effects that being cut off from the financial markets would have had without it? Or both?

A simple way to look at it is that people in the periphery don't like austerity and people in the core don't like transfers. Since there's no fiscal and political integration, and no common mechanism for monetary transfers, ultimately the decision for how much money to provide to the periphery is made on the national level in the core countries. Only after that do the national governments of the periphery come into play.

Of course, there's much more to it than that. If this was the only mechanism, there would be even less of a bailout (or more austerity, same thing). But even if you leave political effects aside, a total economic collapse of one or more countries in the periphery would probably push other countries over the edge and eventually have some very serious economic consequences for the core -- this fear of contagion and collapse cascading through the interconnected banking system works for more aid / less austerity.  
In the other direction, austerity forces governments in the periphery to cut actual waste, crack down on corruption and nepotism/clientelism, fight tax evasion, balance their budgets, and enact structural reforms. Now, normally this should be counterbalanced with stimulus programs to minimize economic contraction, but that would require more money, and more money would reduce the pressure on those governments to enact the unpopular policies that are actually needed. The trust that they'd still do so just isn't there, and there's not much of a mechanism through which such a stimulus could happen through the EU instead of those national governments. Then of course, there's the realpolitk thinking that relying on bailout mechanisms should be seen as as unattractive an option as possible.

Not to mention that when you demand less austerity, what you're really asking for is more money, and even if it wasn't for domestic politics it's not as if the rest of the Eurozone countries were in pristine shape...",0,1361972609,null,0,1361972793,0,c8mkha3,t3_19bjuq,t1_c8mkha3,t3_19bjuq,null,1431425979,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

Yes, there has always been a tradition of moving cash out of the country for tax evasion, this would just turn the trickle into a torrent. Under current EU laws, if I was an Italian resident and had legal Euros, there is nothing to stop me from moving them anywhere within the EU or outside it.

Given the lack of trust in any new lire, a second euro economy would emerge similar to Russia's dollars in the nineties. Note that when the Russian government outlawed the use of the US Dollar in a retail context, the dollars became replaced by ""Units of Exchange"", with the tacit understanding that a UE equalled the dollar at the day rate. Everyone receiving roubles would convert them to dollars on a daily basis as a devaluation hedge.

I would see the same thing happening to a new Italian Lire. Eventually stability would be reached (as happened with the rouble) but after heavy inflation. Those with illiquid investments such as pensions would be pretty much screwed unless they can switch them before the redenomination occurred same with those paid by the state. Private companies wanting to keep their staff will shift to paying in Euros.

Note that the hard currency would almost certainly be the Euro rather than the Dollar because of its ready acceptance elsewhere.

For the rest of Europe, this would be a bad time, especially for those countries bordering Italy. There is a real risk that with a collapsing currency, even more Italians would seek to emigrate.

- There are too many (he would have no problem if the numbers were lower)
- This influence (also from conservative Islam) will have huge negative consequences

So, I personally am more open when it comes to foreigners (hence the heated debate). My stance is that everyone born here (with a german passport) should also be treated as a German. If we don't we risk segregation. 

But, what do you think? Is your Option 1 or Option 2 more common? Is the majority of turks (young/old) really opposed to the german lifestyle? Actively even? How strong is the ""modernist"" movement in your community? Do you see yourself as German or Turkish (or a mix)?
