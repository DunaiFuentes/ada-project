*La grillina Lombardi fa l’antipatica tra gaffe e svarioni*

 Non si pretende cortesia istituzionale, ma solo cortesia. Quando Roberta Lombardi, capogruppo M5S alla Camera, ha commentato con i giornalisti le ipotesi di un nuovo mandato a Giorgio Napolitano, invitandolo a fare il nonno, a godersi la vecchiaia, ha mancato di sensibilità. Napolitano le avrà anche confessato la fatica del Colle, ma la cosa doveva finire lì, non giocata come alibi. Non passa giorno che i capigruppo dei grillini, Lombardi e Crimi, non inciampino in qualche gaffe, non sfiorino il ridicolo, non dimostrino di essere maldestri. Irretiti dalle loro certezze, intolleranti verso chi non vuole infeudarsi alle allucinazioni ideologiche. Eterodiretti dalla Grillo &amp; Casaleggio Associati, suppliscono alle scarse doti politiche con la supponenza e il disprezzo. I vecchi peones che hanno riscaldato gli scranni del Parlamento almeno non facevano danni, erano coscienti della loro nullità. Questi sono pasticcioni e presuntuosi. Roberta Lombardi non si tira mai indietro: un giorno strologa di «fascismo buono», un altro si avventura, senza conoscere la materia, sull’articolo 18, un altro ancora definisce «una porcata di fine legislatura» la decisione del governo di stanziare 40 miliardi affinché la Pubblica amministrazione saldi i debiti con i fornitori. Se si rivolge a un giornalista avverte: «Casaleggio mi ha cazziata perché vi dico troppo». In diretta sul canale web La cosa annuncia che la sala riunioni assegnata al M5S (si chiama ora Sala Tatarella) verrà dedicata a Giancarlo Siani. Lei però lo chiama Angelo. Ieri le hanno rubato pure il portafoglio con gli scontrini delle spese, addio trasparenza! La Rete - elevata dai grillini a entità metafisica, hacker compresi - si è riempita di parodie e di sberleffi nei suoi confronti. Su Raitre, Andrea Sambucco e Brenda Lodigiani fanno la parodia di Lombardi e Crimi. A lei tocca la parte dell’antipatica. «Noi non abbiamo bisogno di parlare con la società civile, noi siamo la società civile»: solo lo «smacchiatore» Bersani poteva farsi umiliare da questa coppia di comici tristi, Vito lo Smentito e la «cittadina» Roberta. Però fanno paura gli sprovveduti che mirano al potere e lo raggiungono per l’effetto combinato di astuzia e naïveté.

I live in Paris, but in the north so pretty near the poorest Paris suburbs. It's not as bad as Pantin or St Denis but it is a bit the same.

I think what's happening in these so feared ""banlieues"" is pretty simple and common : it's a huge concentration of the poorest french population. That alone would be enough to make these cities some difficult cases.

But furthermore, these poorest population is mostly from our past colonies descendant. Therefore, you have a bunch of people who are all together, all poor, the poorest compared to the other french people, and all have a different skin color. I'm deeply convinced that from these premises a rebellious and crmiminal oriented subculture was borned. Which is totally natural. I guess it is a very standard reaction from a set of population living in these circonstances.

Now, resolving this problem would be immensly difficult. You have to move a couple millions of people so that they are not concentrated in the same place. And you have to make it possible for them to arise from their social status. It will take decades.

Still I'm pretty hopeful that the next generation will do better. The two first immigrant generations had very poor jobs. Their children didn't accept to live the same life and became rebellious against the system. Sadly for them, that hasn't been a very successful path and they are still as poor as their parents.

1) Troika negotiations. In the news every single day. Not big news any more. Everyone knows and expects that the public sector will be reduced in size. It was decided last year. The Parliament voted. Some organizations are not needed and nothing prohibits the state from letting some people go. While I would like to see the state hiring more people where they're needed, in schools and hospitals for example, I don't want to pay a single eurocent for illiterate secretaries playing Minesweeper all day. Also, many people will be able to get a pension, unlike private sector employees who were hit harder because some politicians hired their whole electoral districts.

2) Arrests in Halkidiki. You might be surprised, but nobody outside Halkidiki actually cares. Come to think of it, many people in Halkidiki actually want the investment to go on. Some MPs raise the matter because they want to be in the news. That's about it. In the end, if the Police had information about some people, then it was right to act the way it acted. If some of the people arrested can prove otherwise, they'll be able to do so. They're still innocent, until proven guilty. If the Police misbehaved in any way, and they prove their claims, I will be on their side.

3) The Golden Dawn show. It started from Twitter, and then other publications grabbed the opportunity. Enter the usual media whore MPs. 90% of Greeks didn't give a fuck about it, and not because they subscribe to Golden Dawn's views, but because it was a non issue. Golden Dawn should be in the spotlight in every opportunity, because it's the only way they will deflate. We have the most stupid leftist parties in the whole Universe. They don't understand that any kind of banning will lead to radicalization. Let them see the Sun every single day and they will burn.

4) New Communist leader. In the news for a few hours. 95% of Greeks forgot about it within a few minutes. Probably 90% of KKE's members will also forget about it in a few years.

5) Switching off Indymedia. 99% of Greeks don't give a fuck.

More about Indymedia.

&gt; So, you think this was just a financial problem, wasting of state funds? If that was the case, then it's up to the university to decide, not the minister of public order or any public prosecutor. Believe me, I've seen universities, Greek or otherwise, waste much more resources in much less important things than a citizen journalism website.

What kind of argument is this? There's more waste elsewhere, let's turn our backs and leave? We think that we're better than others so let us be?

Public institutions do not provide free hosting to private entities. Ask your non-Greek university to host your local Indymedia. The people *running* Athens Indymedia have nothing to do with NTUA. How do I know? Well, I've actually been to an open discussion where they were present. Some of them are in their 40s. They're also homophobic, but that's another story.

Did you ever wonder why other Indymedia centres pay for their hosting? Are they stupid and oppressed? Why other Greek citizen journalism websites pay for their hosting? Did you ever wonder why Greek anti-establishment citizen journalism websites pay for their hosting, too?

About high school friends, this leads to an interesting thing. Those who are in the elite tier, and know it, automatically assume that what we may call pop culture is not for them, it was meant for the masses. So they don't reflect on it in any way, just avoid. At least its most simplistic subset. At least this was my experience in Hungary and I am sure Germany is similar, because of a similar educational system: as gymnasium students, we were not ""supposed"" to like Backstreet Boys and suchlike (it was around 1992-1994), it was understood as something ""for the masses"". So we did not reflect on pop culture in any way. If anyone asked us about it, we would have said it is [prolefeed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolefeed), why should we be interested in any way?

So I did not understand that ""hipster"" phenomenon, primarily American, that I saw online i.e. reflecting ironically on pop culture. Then I understood it comes from the school system. Teenagers to 18 or so are kept in the illusion that it is a very equal system, everybody goes to the same school, everybody is the same people, therefore everything that is popular, is popular for everything. Therefore, intellectual teens first assumed they should like pop culture. Because this is what is popular, right? They did not understand that there is a ""mass culture"" and ""elite culture"", because they were raised in the illusion that everybody is just the same people. For a few years at least they believed pop-culture is ""meant for them"" and they felt let down when they realized how dumb it is, and this is where this ironic reaction of ""hipsters"" comes from.

What I think with biofuel, is that just because it the moment we happen to be getting it in a somewhat dubious way (Indonesia), doesn't mean it has to be that way. Once we have an established biofuel infrastructure it doesn't matter where we get the ingredients for the fuel from. So in the future we'll be very easily able to adapt and just use land in different areas which have less of a history of being forests (like Africa).

If someone decent takes power Italy might as well be the same level as Germany. Italy is huge producer of technology-cars, ships and weapons. Yes we make weapons. Also Italy is mostly self-sufficient. It produces enough food and electricity(but the buy from France to make some lying schemes and steal our money). Also Italy gets a lot of money out of tourism. Mussolini had a policy of autarky which can be used today easily. The only thing we lack is natural fuels but they can be acquired.

The other problem we have is the difference between the North and the South. The regional structures aren't equally developed(as the North has much more economy). This is our only big problem-but it's not impossible to fix. We just invest in companies that develop the South and people there get more jobs. It's called protectionism. We should do it(example:if you buy an Italian car you pay 5% less taxes for the car or something).

The other thing is-we should stop our outrageous welfare system and stop giving out money to immigrants who just moved to leach off of this nation. That way we can increase the salaries and pensions(which in the North are already equal to German ones)

Last but not least-we need to kill the corruption. That isn't too hard. I just need 10 able and honest prosecutors with some honest judges and the head of the corruption snake will be cut off. Remember that this is possible. Italy was the fastest developing European country not so long ago.

C'est une vieille institution bourgeoise créée pour interdire à l'Église de tenir un état civil parallèle. On devrait le remplacer par une reconnaissance d'union, décorrélée du fait d'avoir des enfants, ou de toute conséquence de filiation. 

Un couple, ce n'est pas une famille. Or le mariage reste dans la loi l'institution préalable à la création d'une famille (article 213 du code civil). Ceci n'est plus d'actualité. 

De plus, le mariage en France n'est pas un droit fondamental. On n'est pas aux US ici, l'histoire du mariage n'est pas là même. Ici, la demande d'accès au mariage est un combat d'arrière garde. Ici, ça fait 40 ans qu'on se bat pour le droit de ne pas se marier.

Je suis contre un code civil qui continue d'obliger des couples (homos ou non) à se marier pour pouvoir adopter en couple. Après, il y a une réflexion à avoir sur les liens entre filiation légale et filiation biologique, mais je ne suis pas fixé là-dessus.

Je suis contre une loi sur la famille qui ne permet pas la reconnaissance des beaux-parents et qui n'aborde par les 200 000 personnes vivant dans des foyers polygames.

Je suis contre le fait qu'un petit lobby bourgeois supplante la volonté du peuple (la majorité des Français est contre l'adoption par des couples de même sexe, donc la majorité des Français est contre cette loi) pour un vieux symbole.

(TCK-216/3, for Turkish speakers)  I'd always assumed that this was intended for cases like someone walking into a crowded mosque yard on a Friday and screaming 'there is no God, go home' etc.  Now, it is iffy even in that form but it is not an explicit anti-blasphemy law.

true,astute_stoat,null,null,"Architecture and design definitely played a part in shaping the situation we see today. Belgium, for instance, has a highly urban population and also experienced immigration in large numbers in the post-war period, but doesn't have similar *banlieues* or *cités* because it didn't experience an acute housing crisis like France did, and didn't have to resort to building giant housing projects in new settlements.

France suffered a housing crisis during the 1930's, with few new housing projects, and a general degradation of existing apartment buildings and houses. The tax code of the time, coupled with the economic downturn, made it very unattractive for landlords to renovate or improve existing housing. The situation was even worse in the wake of the Second World War, with entire cites such as Brest or Cherbourg razed to the ground. 

In an effort to both provide cheap housing and ease urban congestion, many new housing projects were designed far from existing city centers. These resolutely modernist cities were supposed to provide lodging and basic shopping facilities, but were mostly residential. Workers would take public transport and ride into the city or nearest industrial estate in the morning, and come back in the evening. Look at it like a big game of Sim City: designated residential areas were kept away from commercial and industrial areas.

While certainly not everything that went wrong can be blamed on this choice of city planning, it's still responsible for trapping and retaining poverty. Living away from the city sucks, and all those who can afford to go elsewhere, do. So much for improving the community. Furthermore, this system raised generations of kids who hardly ever saw anyone work: the only adults around the *cité* during weekdays would be stay-at-home parents, or unemployed. This was in stark contrast with the previous situation of poor working-class communities, who would live close to, or even on, industrial estates.

Reliance on public transport also turned out to be problematic. While all of the *villes nouvelles* built far from Paris were connected to suburban rail links, in many smaller cities people had to rely on buses. Buses that were supposed to bring people to and back from work, and thus only ran on weekdays during the day. Teenagers and young adults without cars would be stuck in the *cité* and could not socialize with young people elsewhere. 

I'd add that Le Corbusier was batshit insane, and his designs - and those of his spiritual successors - are exercises in urban terrorism. Their resolutely modernist approach attempted to shape and dictate the behaviour of people using design and architecture. For instance, if your window overlooked the bus stop, you might have had to take a long detour to go down there, because it was believed that in a very large building, there should only be one door so that people could socialize. Even if it's hugely impractical, even if you want to socialize in other ways. You didn't get a say. Other horrors include 2m-high ceilings ('who needs more?'), gardens you aren't allowed to enter (only look at), or shopping galleries on the top floor of a 12-story building (ensuring that people never leave the building). And as it turns out, highly integrated areas like these offer little to no flexibility when it comes to redesigns, upgrades, renovations, etc. which also contributed to the gradual decay and general state of disrepair. Want to take down that shopping gallery and build a daycare centre instead? Too bad, you have to take down the whole block of flats with it.

Hope this helps, good luck with the presentation!

They were the ""big stories"" from a leftist perspective and not because I say so.

The fact that Eleftherotypia is a leftist newspaper does not mean that the news items I posted were themselves skewed. What would the alternative be? Not provide any source at all? I just chose one that made sense at the time. I did not say that any of these stories were necessarily important in a grand scale, just that they were what's on the news these days. 

Your whole argument is about dismissing the news items I provided as unimportant but you still have not posted any other stories that you think are more important. What was I supposed to do? Say ""nothing is happening in Greece atm. I will let you know if any cataclysmic event takes place""?

&gt; Troika negotiations. In the news every single day. Not big news any more. 

It's in the news every single day therefore it's not big news any more? How the hell are people who do not watch Greek news every day supposed to know about it?

It's a contested matter. That is just your opinion which happens to coincide with the official government position and in no way reflects objective reality.

Actually, the particular law they used for this is roughly an anti-racism, anti-cultural denigration law.  There are (possibly EU-funded, certainly EU-friendly) groups here who use that law to go after 'hate speech.'   This bright idea about using a clause of it as an anti-blasphemy law is a recent development.  

Leaving blasphemy aside, the EU, from what I can tell, is hardly US-like when it comes to freedom of expression.  There are groups in Turkey who appear to have formed an unholy alliance with both local religious groups and groups within the EU to push for even stronger ""hate speech"" laws that include blasphemy (not named as such, of course).

Its stability would additionally require effective instruments to ensure that others, who do not want to accept this, can be ideologically marginalised, politically dis-organised and physically kept in check.

&gt; According to academic Corey Robin: ""Hayek admired Pinochet's Chile so much that he decided to hold a meeting of his Mont Pelerin Society in Viña del Mar, the seaside resort where the coup against Allende was planned. In 1978 he wrote to The Times that he had 'not been able to find a single person even in much maligned Chile who did not agree that personal freedom was much greater under Pinochet than it had been under Allende.'""[88]

&gt; Asked about the liberal, non-democratic rule by a Chilean interviewer, Hayek is translated from German to Spanish to English as having said, ""As long term institutions, I am totally against dictatorships. But a dictatorship may be a necessary system for a transitional period. [...] Personally I prefer a liberal dictator to democratic government lacking liberalism. My personal impression – and this is valid for South America – is that in Chile, for example, we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to a liberal government.""

They might mobilize quite a few voters who would otherwise have abstained - the majority of them former supporters of CDU and FDP, but also some who voted SPD before. The Euro bailouts aren't that popular among centrist SPD supporters, either.

Also and more importantly, it's impossible to predict the result of this election even without the AfD. [A few recent national polls for the interested.](http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/index.htm)

In the polls, the coalition (CDU+FDP) and the combined opposition (SPD, Greens, and Leftists) are almost tied. 

A majority for CDU+FDP would, of course, result in a continuation of the coalition. 

SPD+Greens, on the other hand, don't want to form a coalition with the Leftists - but they are nowhere near a majority without them.

Even if the smaller partner of the coalition (FDP) should fail to get to 5% - I don't think there'll be a majority without Merkel's CDU after the elections.

It looks very unlikely for the SPD to become stronger than the CDU, so Merkel would stay in office in a Grand Coalition.

- - -
Anyhow, how does the AfD influence this?

They might steal just enough votes (or mandates) from the coalition to prevent a CDU+FDP victory, thus forcing a Grand coalition. They might even push the FDP over the 5% edge - but this would very likely still force a GC.

Or they might be the only reason that there isn't even a mathematical majority for SPD+Greens+Leftists, thus undermining the SPD's negotiating position for a Grand coalition.",0,1366037609,null,0,false,0,c9flsqt,t3_1cbp30,t1_c9flsqt,t1_c9fl87b,null,1431550586,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

This is not the fundamental contradiction that the book talks about. The book's thesis is that the co-existence of capitalism and democracy has been an uneasy one, built on shaky foundations. 

The argument is that the after WW2, the states managed to make both voters and shareholders (""capitalists"" might be a better term) happy by borrowing from shareholders to fund welfare for the voters. Instead of taxing the capital, the states were merely borrowing. 

The problem with this is, of course, that the moment welfare spending stops looking like a sound investment you have a conflict of interest. Within a functioning democracy, it's politically infeasible to reduce the standard of living just for logistical purposes. On the other hand, the shareholders want their return of investment.

Non, le code civil ne dit pas ça. La loi c'est important, et c'est plus compliqué que des *envies*, que j'appelle des caprices de bourgeois jaloux. Le Parlement, ce n'est pas une simple chambre d'enregistrement des demandes sociales de groupes minoritaires.

Lis les articles du code civil. Étudie la manière dont ils ont été créés. Ça parle de famille, ça a une histoire. Ça n'est pas fait pour répondre à des *envies*.

&gt;Et qu'on l'apprécie ou non le fait est que le mariage surtout en cas de parentalité partagée avec le partenaire (naturelle ou non) alloue bien plus de protection civile que n'importe quelle autre combinaison de contrats.

Donc le mariage, c'est plus que de la reconnaissance. D'une part, cela contredit ta première phrase, d'autre part, c'est le problème de cette loi : on mélange symbolique bourgeoise un peu kitsch avec droits sociaux importants. Et surtout, on oublie tout le temps de parler de devoirs.

&gt;Mais le plus important est surtout que personne ne se bat contre le mariage des hétéros, donc en se battant contre celui des homos on les discrimine.

Et on discrimine aussi les polygames et les couples non mariés.

Je vais faire une allégorie : quand il y a un trou dans une route, on peut soit 

- réparer toutes les roues qui s'abîment en roulant sur le trou
- réparer le trou

Le problème, c'est que le gouvernement choisit de réparer uniquement les voitures qui ont des roues roses.

&gt;Mais le plus important est surtout que personne ne se bat contre le mariage des hétéros, donc en se battant contre celui des homos on les discrimine.

Si, on est plein. On est là depuis 40 ans à essayer d'en finir avec la filiation imposée et le mariage civil obligatoire. 

Malheureusement, nous ne sommes plus médiatiques. On a des avis plus compliqués à comprendre que ceux de Frigide Barjot. On pose de vraies questions et on n'a rien contre les homos alors c'est plus compliqué de nous traiter d'homophobes.

true,dalysp,IREL,Ireland,"Although I agree with you in that our system does leave a lot to be desired, especially with regard the marking system and the provision for special needs, I do think it is a common and unfair critique that our education system is bad. 
  
The first article here looks at the level of science and maths in our education system. This is a common critique, which I think is very unfair and unrealistic. I would think that although Irish people are ok at these two subjects we are by no means world leaders. I mean how many Nobel laureates do we have in science? (1 as far as I'm aware) Compared with the number we have in Literature (4 I think) is it really surprising then that we aren't world beaters in science?  

The second article looks at literacy rates. The first thing to note is that there is very little difference in literacy rates for the top 30 or so countries. All of whom have 99% or above, Ireland is in this category. So is it really a problem that we're not 0.1% higher? 

The final article relates back to the first, but is more a problem of attitude than education. I think it is hard to say that the teaching of maths and science has deteriorated significantly since 2006. I believe this is more of a change in interest of students. Its simply that there are less students interested in this today than there were 7 years ago. In a few years time this will probably pick back up. Possibly because students see the jobs that such subjects can create.

To end I would like to point out that this statistic is something Ireland should be proud of. We are definitely becoming a knowledge centre in Europe. At the moment there are plenty of Irish educated workers living and working across the globe in Australia, South Africa, America and Canada. All of whom are promoting the benefits of Irish education.

Yet, he didn't disappear in a puff of logic, did he?  They never do, and they are seldom convinced.  There seems to be a kind of (perhaps formerly socialist?) intellectual who, with the best intentions, wants to rule or bring about social transformation through legal coercion.  If they said this explicitly, it'd be OK since, then, they'd give you a solid position to investigate and argue against but they don't. This approach is often buried in obscurantism and noble-sounding nonsense.  Don't know why exactly this happens but it happens over and over.  

In a different age Orwell noticed this and pegged it as un-reason giving way to oppression -- not just in 1984 but also [at least] in his Politics and the English Language essay.  This Turkish boy read both years ago, and they resonated because of similar stuff that could be observed and experienced locally.  Now, it might well be that [here come the downvotes!] Turkey is more European than we realize, or there might be some general pattern there that's latent in organized political activity.

The point in quoting Wikipedia was that the briefest research undermined what you said. I'm glad you elaborated somewhat from your earlier response, although you're arguing somewhat beside the point. E.g. with healthcare I amended what I said from specialised hospitals to a health care system (because I'm arguing about the level of govt expenditure, not whether you have this building or that on your territory).

&gt; So sending 25 % of your GDP south for the next 50 years? How does that sound?

It has been increasingly clear that the current problems are going to cost huge amounts of German taxpayer money. Some people have said that for a while and I don't disagree. We can keep lending the South money, or we can just send it to them, or we can have a Marshal plan, or we can have a more or less orderly breakup of the eurozone. Since that right-wing anti-euro party that is currently being formed had some congress these day's there was some media attention on what a unilateral German exit would cost. I think the estimates where something on the line of 700 billion plus. In a lump sum, basically. That's a huge shock. Additionally, you have the South hating us even more because after all the austerity stuff we just leave them. 

I am honestly not opposed to sending some percentage of GDP south annually, if that keeps stuff together and balances out the inequalities. Surely this would give Germany some leeway in implementing reforms our way (but I'm not sure whether I really want *that*). I also have not looked at the effect on my personal life with the equivalent of our defense budget or stuff going to the periphery. 25% annually is not feasible anyway.

At this point I do think the politicians need to tell us the truth and say that we need to spend huge amounts on Europe, and what their plan is. Not gonna happen before elections though, and surely not with Merkel who never leads, but waits for popular opinion to form and then goes with that. Especially with popular opinion not understanding the complexities (not saying people are dumb, but take austerity and the ""can't spend more than you earn"" thing for example. Economically that's stupid, but very popular nevertheless. The problems we face are huge and complex and need to be explained to the populace). 

&gt; Also, the advantages of the Euro seems to be overestimated. Finland &lt;snip&gt;

Finland is not Germany. Until recently, Germany has been the biggest exporter worldwide. China has only a few years back caught up, and that's with an undervalued currency. A lot of our exports go into the euro zone. Just removing exchange rate risk is a huge boon to German exports. On top of that you have the fact that, Spain say, can not devaluate to adjust for loss in competitiveness. That has really helped us. Of course, the latter also part of the problem and can probably not be sustained forever, without sending some of the money earned right back (which makes it a bit stupid). On the other hand, Italy had a currency that was devaluating against the Deutschmark for decades, and they got along quite well. They can't do that anymore...
But the point stands, the biggest gain from the Euro goes to Germany, which is funny considering that supposedly the Euro was the price for Reunification and meant to keep Germany down :)

&gt; Which brings me really to the most important point, something that everyone seems to have lost sight off. A currency union is supposed to be beneficial, to bring advantages. I don't think the Euro, in its current form is bringing any advantages for anyone. Short run, the north, but in the long run you will loose to. Countries are supposed to want to be in ones, not fight to stay out (Sweden, Poland etc). 

It has brought advantages. The German advantage seems pretty obvious. Other countries have gotten the ""Deutschmark"" price stability, low interest rates and more (Of course that seems to have been a double-edged sword, as Krugman [points out](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/15/europe-in-brief/). Also, you don't have to change money anymore. 
There is non-economic advantages too. Recently, I was in Portugal for a few days. It's basically like going to another city now. Passport: Not needed. Health Insurance: Valid everywhere in Europe. Driver's Licence: same. No need to change money. No immigration controls. Okay, they speak another language, but I speak English most of the day anyway and my Spanish is good enough to understand basic Portuguese. That's an advantage of European integration people often forget. Not everyone get's to enjoy it as much as others, and not everyone sees it, but I think it's really cool.

Also we have had peace in Europe for so long. Discarding the dissolution of Yugoslavia, we have had uninterrupted peace since almost 70 years, over the whole continent. Historically, that's an absolute exception. I am in the second generation that does not have to go invade France again. For this reason alone, I think, European integration is worth almost any price. Of course the peace argument pulls less weight if you are from Sweden that just watches and assembles furniture :)

By the way, I also feel that German opinion is turning. Maybe not popular opinion, but among the elites, it is. Just a few weeks back, it was abundantly clear that austerity is the way to go and that this is really obvious. Just over the last 5 days or so I read several commentaries that said one of ""Apparently, austerity does not work"", ""Even if, the willingness to reform in the South has been exhausted"" or ""It does nor really matter anymore whodunnit, we have a problem of historical size and it is only Germany that can fix it. So let's find a solution"". Still, it's a long way to go...

Sorry for not arguing really towards your points. It's clear that the Euro as such has problems, maybe irreparably so. And that any solution, constructive or not, is going to cost money to the extent that even my personal standard of living may be affected (which I don't really like), and that our leaders have no clue what to do. Interesting times indeed. 

PS: This one
&gt; Breaking up the Euro is expensive, but then you are out and can control your destiny.
needs another comment. It is consensus among the German elites that there is no such thing as ""German destiny"" anymore. We have purposefully interwoven our national destiny with the European project. It says so in the constitution, right in the preamble and it says so out of many a politician's mouth, when they actually speak about stuff that matters. And I say rightly so. Germany is provably too big for Europe to be in it alone, without integration. But it is also too small to be in the world alone (there is a quote on this line, but I am too lazy to find the author).

Then to be fair you still have a lot to learn (no offense), I complained about how terrible the points system was while I was in secondary school too and it definitely isn't the best system but if you're intelligent and work hard you are definitely going to do well. There are always the people who say that points aren't a good measure of intelligence and that is true to a point, but the vast majority of these ""intelligent"" people did fuck all study and are looking for an excuse afterwards. It isn't simply about people intelligent enough for a university course, it also wants to see if you are willing to work hard while you are third level and are less likely to drop out in first year.

Not to mention that there is normally always a way to get into the course you want regardless of points. Through DARE, entry-courses and other programmes we definitely have one of the most accommodating third level systems in the world.

&gt;In primary schools, religion is thought more than science

That just isn't true and regardless there is only so much you can go into as regards the sciences without the foundations you pick up in maths and general science in the first three years of secondary. You're complaining that our 10 year olds aren't mathematicians.

&gt;the testing system we use to determine eligibility rewards people with good memories - rather than people who are actually more suited to the course

As I said the points system isn't the best, however if you didn't get the course you want it's simply because you didn't put in the work. People can argue about this as much as they like but it is the simple truth.

Public schools before university are entirely free. I agree with this. Most universities are public too (except an entry fee of around 300 to 600 euros). I agree with public universities, however, I think there should be a stronger selection of students before entry - because how the system works, in general anyone can get into any field after high school - I think the fields which demand fewer students (like, say, sociology) should have selections of some sort, because the state wastes too much money schooling a bunch of kids on university programs with little future, most of these kids waste their years in programs which won't get them a job (I'm not saying sociology is useless, I'm saying too many kids study sociology - most won't work in anything related to that because there aren't enough jobs looking for sociology majors - so there should be a limited number of places for students who want to study sociology.. for their own good). 

Otherwise, in middle and high school, I feel there isn't enough sports education. It's half a day per week (three hours or so). That's not enough. I think it should be at least two half days per school week.. Say tuesday afternoon and thursday afternoon.

Successive governments and education ministers have been tinkering with the system since the 1960s when comprehensive (all ability) schools were first introduced. So we don't have a 'system' so much as a ramshackle set of different exam types, exam boards, different types of schools etc. Some people do a baccalaureate at an independent school, some people do GCSEs at an academy. There's no logical rhyme and reason to it. 

I think the education people get here ranges from acceptable to superb, I think much of the teaching is superb and the curricula is generally good, but the qualifications side of it is a bit of a shambles. It's not clear to employers now what new qualifications are worth because they're changed so often and there's so much controversy. 

To improve it I would like 

* More emphasis on improving standards in the State sector instead of just neglecting those families who can't afford to pay. The State schools can be a post code lottery - some as good as the expensive public schools - some falling far behind. They need tonnes more investment. 

* Long term pension and pay guarantees for teachers to make it an attractive profession for talented graduates 

* A simplified and centralised examinations system so that one person's GCSE maths is the same as another's. 

* Better maintained school buildings and more access to playing fields for school sports

Normally you can take the RER B train into town (Chatelet station) in about 45 minutes. There's been some construction on that line and sometimes the part nearest the airport is replaced with bus service. Seems to be the case on the 26th after 11:15pm. So that might slow things down a bit. 

Alternate way is to take RoissyBus (takes you to Opéra) or the Air France Les Cars bus (http://www.lescarsairfrance.com/en.html, last bus 11pm). 

The latter can take you to Étoile, i.e. the Arc de Triomphe, which puts you in a great place to walk down the Champs Elysées -&gt; Louvre -&gt; Notre Dame -&gt; Quartier Latin (lots of night life).

Eiffel Tower closes at 11pm, so you probably won't make it there in time to go up. 

No idea what to recommend doing if it gets rainy in the middle of the night... looks like the first RER B train back to the airport goes around 5:30am and if I remember right the first Air France bus is around 6:30.

Krugman is an absolute moron and so far has only professed the end of the euro - he's been wrong all along.

Calling the crisis an euro crisis is outright false, it's a sovereign debt crisis and it's harming European countries just as it is harming the US, the only difference is that they hide their symptoms by devaluing their currency whereas we must actually tackle them.

Saying the euro is a bad currency is bullshit, it's a great currency, people criticise it because it does its job of storing value too well and because inflation is kept under control and some governments such as ours are therefore forced to balance their budgets as opposed to present constant deficits while the population loses purchasing power regardless but through inflation, you know, like it was done before the euro.

&gt;&gt;First, ECB intervention to stabilize borrowing costs.

Eurobonds will come.

&gt;&gt;Second, aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion in the core, to ease the process of internal adjustment.

More Keynesian nonsense: ""Print a lot of money and spend it all!"", what a fucking genius! I guess he wants us to go through what [Ecuador](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Ecuador#Economy_1998-2006) went through!

&gt;&gt;Third, a softening of austerity demands on the periphery — not zero austerity, but less, so that the human costs would be less. 

Yeah, we'd be doing just that if we could afford it. Unfortunately we can't, we first have to pay for all the retarded fiscal expansionary policies Sócrates implemented here. No free lunch for us!

When we go back to a gold standard or when we slash environmental regulation for property rights, you can talk about Austrian economics, till then, you're just wrong.

&gt;Thankfully, they are slowly being convinced by the mountain of evidence that this is the correct path and timidly following it.

Of what? That we should spend our way out of a crisis made by excessive public spending? Yeah, not really, we're going to stick through with the reforms, balance the budget and liberalise the economy.

Pros:

- NO TUITION fees from Elementary grade 1 -&gt; finished Masters from Uni. We actually get paid(around €300-500/month) by the government to study on Uni level, as long as we get at least 45 points a year towards our diploma.

- No private schools. All systems are coordinated by the Finnish government. Some special programs such as IB or EB baccalaureate can have tuition(E.G International Schools). Gives everyone a more or less equal start in life.

- No real competition between schools. No competition in school except on exams. It is better that kids learn how to cooperate rather than always doing individual work.

- School days usually around 6h, homework is based on things we have done in class or are about to do in class. No home-studies that are expected on exams.

- Values different learning. People respond different to methods of learning. This is why it is important to make a fine line between written learning, vocal learning and independent work.

- How smart you are is 100% of what you can achieve in this country education wise, you cannot buy yourself into Uni.

- Free full meal of food every day in school grades 1-9, and 1-3 upper(high school). Soups, Meatballs and mashed potatoes, Fish and cooked potatoes, chicken and rice, and a salad table.

Cons:

- Bureaucrats want to ""cut spending"" because somehow the system we did by hand 35 years ago takes too much time nowadays with computers and modern technology...

- Language learning is bad. We are basically taught grammar only. Don't get me wrong, almost everyone knows English and the majority can communicate in Swedish, but its a different story for all languages that we have no relationship with outside the classroom. I did French for 6 years and didn't learn anything. Only now have I learned it. Who the hell learned to write before they could speak as toddlers? There's a reason for that!

- We have no upper level ""snob"" Uni for the really talented because every Uni gets funding equally depending on the amount of students and their diploma/student rate.

Wäre mir neu. Außerdem ging es hauptsächlich um Zensur von Sätzen und ""Umdeutungen"". Aber ist hier ja nicht Thema von daher lassen wir das.

Hab hier gleich mehrere Studien dazu:

* [OECD Bericht](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/171239.pdf). Auf Seite 29, Punkt 59. Dort wird zwar nicht Deutschland erwähnt, aber wie man beim [Statistischen Bundeamt](https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/GesamtwirtschaftUmwelt/VerdiensteArbeitskosten/VerdienstunterschiedeMaennerFrauen/Tabellen/GenderPayGap_EU.html?nn=50690) erfährt, liegt der Unterschied bei 22%. Ich verlinke hier den Bericht, weil er allgemein einen guten Überblick gibt und die Datenerhebung offengelegt ist.

* [Aralumpalam Booth und Bryan 2007](http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1261&amp;context=ilrreview&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.de%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Dde%26q%3DArulampalam%2BBooth%2BBryan%2B2007%26btnG%3D%26lr%3D#search=%22Arulampalam%20Booth%20Bryan%202007%22). Auf Seite 7 findet man unter anderem 

&gt; In contrast, in the private sector,
the raw average gender gap exceeded 13%
in all countries, and in Britain and Austria
it was close to 30%. In France, Germany,
Ireland, the Netherlands, and Spain the gap
was around or over 20%


Der Unterschied ist übrigens in der Sozialwissenschaft überhaupt kein Streitpunkt, sondern man befasst sich eigentlich nur noch damit, wie viel Prozentpunkte man von diesen 20-25% Einkommensunterschieden durch andere Faktoren erklären kann. Da wirds ja auch erst richtig interessant. Dementsprechend hier eine Studie:

* [Leuze Strauß 2009.](http://www.zfs-online.org/index.php/zfs/article/viewFile/1303/840) Sie benutzen hier drei verschiedene Ansätze um die Lohnunterschiede zu erklären, sind aber nicht dazu in der Lage 11% der etwa 20% im Lohnunterschied zwischen Mann und Frau zu erklären.

Die ""reale finanzielle Diskriminierung"" von Frauen gegenüber Männern in Deutschland liegt also im Bereich von 11%.



Dass das [Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft](http://www.iwkoeln.de/de/presse/pressemitteilungen/beitrag/beschaeftigungsperspektiven-von-frauen-nur-2-prozent-gehaltsunterschied-102500) das anders sieht sollte einen nicht überraschen. Die wären ja schön blöd, wenn die Arbeitgeber offen zugeben würden, dass sie Frauen einfach daher schlechter bezahlen, weil sie Frauen sind.

If you are the one who downvoted this submission, I urge you to remove your downvote and instead upvote.

We have all lost sight of the facts and there is indeed misinformation from all sides regarding the euro and what the actual problems are.

Unfortunately, the only way we are going to get close to a proper debate and maybe some actions is to make the euro crisis debate inevitable.

This kind of article is a good step towards it. No matter which side of the debate you are on: euro federalist, indifferent, euroskeptic -- I recommend we all send emails/letters, and preferably even phone calls to our members of parliament, MEPs, political parties on the very basic things we can still all agree to: the current situation is very bad and action is desired/demanded immediately, perhaps a real debate on what is the best way to fix the eurozone crisis -- preferably determined by the voters.

The current phase we're stuck in is starting to become annoying and it's increasing tensions. If my preferred choice of a federal eurozone of some kind is not possible, then I prefer the eurozone to be wound down in as orderly way as possible rather than being stuck in this situation where we are just throwing money in a hole while seeing a lot of suffering going around and people from different countries starting to become hostile to each other in their words. I am afraid the longer it takes for actions, more damage will be done. We may have already passed the threshold where people will just say 'screw it' the moment they are allowed to make a choice -- I hope not.

Personal note: If they are honestly planning to postpone any kind of true actions until the 2014 EU elections, I'm voting anti-euro just on principle at that point, even though it doesn't represent my view. The entire concept of inaction due to any kind of election is dangerous in itself, especially considering how long this has been ongoing.

One class a semester out of a few optional subjects like art, music, computers, shop, language (normally Spanish or French). So if a student chooses to do so they can have a 2nd language as an elective class starting in 7th grade on all they way until graduating high school (age 18). The language classes consist of basic vocabulary and verbs. Each semester builds on the previous semesters instruction. I went to a high school in a upper middle class suburb and we had language labs were we would go in and listen to pre recorded conversations (in the foreign language). That is not normal for most high schools though. High school students are required to take a couple of semesters of a foreign language. When I graduated from high school I had completed 5 years of Spanish and couldn't understand a native speaker. I could read some and maybe ask for directions. 

Now there are charter public schools which offer an emphasis in certain areas. For example a school that focuses on technology, theater arts, or language. There are a couple of language immersion charter schools in my area. These start from kindergarten on. Half of the day is taught in one language and the other half in the 2nd language. Ever few weeks they switch so each subject is taught in both languages through out the year. These charter schools are a new creation. 

Edit: How does the rest of the educational system in Beligum compare? Are they spot on with language instruction but sorely lacking in other ares? Or are they good across the board? ",0,1366079640,null,0,1366080182,0,c9g18jr,t3_1cew9d,t1_c9g18jr,t1_c9g0lqu,null,1431543167,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

There are generally very few electives, you can only choose between various tracks which could include classical languages or not, a focus on science, on languages or on economics. Our school was pretty high on the ""Let's create doctors and engineers"" pretension scale though, catholics-in-name-only, but no matter where you go, a language or two will be mandatory at a serious level. 

The secondary schools (13-18) are separate and split between academic and trades oriented, so at age 12/13 there is a bit of a reset button. From there it's learn vocabulary, learn grammar rules, do exercises until you get can the majority right on paper and in in-class conversation. How good it is depends entirely on having a good teacher, but generally you can expect your teacher to be able to speak the language fluently and without serious accent.

My impression is that English in the US is more about literature than English itself. Most european languages are harder to write, and studying your own grammar is a large part of it at the beginning. For me, combined with ancient texts, which are like grammar puzzles to decipher because of how different it is, you get a pretty thorough understanding of grammar out of it, and learning a new language is like opening another door into something familiar.

The level of language education obviously varies, but if there is a class, it'll aim to develop professional skill.

On the French-speaking side (Wallonia), the system is similar, but the language spectrum is different and statistics I've seen point to much less bi and trilinguals in the population. French speakers have less reason to learn the native Dutch over English and other world languages, and French culture is much bigger than Flemish if you factor in France, so there is more of an island-effect.

I don't give two shits if Nikolić steals 200000eur from some project that costs 10 million.

What I do mind is when I want to build a house in Zlatibor, there's no way in hell I can do it LEGALLY without bribing at least 10 people in the local municipality. First, the obtain the building permit, then to obtain the power hook up permit, then to obtain a permit for the permit, then to obtain the photocopy of the permit for the permit, etc. You don't even enter the office without around 100e in your pocket. It's the sad truth. That's what bothers me. That's the ""city hall"" argument I'm talking about. Not when I go to obtain the proof of citizenship, no. But the moment you show up with some money enthused about doing a project, they're taking it from you. 

The argument I made was not actually made by me - I'm surprised you don't know about it, since it originates from the US I believe. Yes, I would argue the same for other countries as well. For example, the people in the US are very wealthy yet their government is likely more corrupt than the Serbian one. 

If you think every government we've had so far is corrupt, why do you think that is? They just start working for the gov and decide on being corrupt? No, that's not how it works.

Government is a bunch of regular Joes. Hell, my ex gf's mom works for the government, fairly high up. Regular woman with regular, average wage. I worked for the National Bank of Serbia for a while as well, also regular guy who had a slightly-above average wage at that point. Like I said, they do not fall from Mars. They're simply the people from our surrounding. 

Here's my argument: even if the absolute power does corrupt, it still means that the people themselves are corrupt. Otherwise, they would have not been corrupted, right? Because the girl working for EPS in Serbia and the one working for the equivalent in Sweden have the same amount of power (in all likelihood) - but the one in Serbia chooses to abuse that power and be corrupt. That means that the girl in Serbia is corrupt. 

So ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" - yes, but why does it not corrupt to the same extent the people in other WEuropean countries? No one has absolute powers in this country anymore.

Oh, and let's make another thing clear: I did not give out a single bribe to any of those people I mentioned. I ended up waiting for 2 years for something that could have been done in a month with a bribe, but I am legal and my consciousness is sound. 

I agree with your last two paragraphs, especially since I see no one on the political scene capable of undertaking enormous changes or arresting people because of this problem. It is great that Vučić started making at least some arrests, but he needs to hit the ""common folks"" as well, and hit them hard.

true,Bumbomachides,BAVA,Bayern,"&gt;Tacitus’s book was exactly what nationalists had been waiting for.

That's not quite true. The Germania was first used by Italians for different political purposes. The first known use was in a letter by Enea Silvio Piccolomini (Pope Pius II.) adressed to the chancellor of Kurmainz. The chancellor complained to the pope about the (mostly financial) burdens imposed on the German nation by the Roman Church. In his answer Enea Silvio used the *Germania* to show that the Germans once were barbarians and are now - thanks to the Roman Curia of course - a people of culture and wealth. He didn't intend to give Germans new self confidence, but he wanted to show them that he as pope is rightfully controlling many parts of German politics. 
Same goes for Giovanni Antonio Campano who used the *Germania* to instigate the Germans to a crusade against the Turks. So he used Tacitus' image of the Germans as warriors.

And so on... The nationalistic interpretation of the *Germania* was merely a reaction to those interpretations offered by Italian humanists and clergymen.

2. A minority government gets tolerated. This has never happened on the federal level, happened IIRC once on state level, and generally has no tradition in the political culture. And it's hard to establish without first destroying fractional discipline, that is, parliamentarians voting en block and only en block.

The SPD won't form a coalition with the Linke, which is a bloody shame and not even the usual balkanisation of the left, but due to the currently dominant right wing of the SPD being gamblers: Failure to at least begin again to pay lip service to actual left positions will just turn more and more SPD voters either towards the Linke or away from the ballots.

As I said I was too large . On the forums someone mentioned it's coded in the AI that the Emperor will not accept any provinces from someone larger then himself. I had 195ish relations with the emperor, a military alliance and so on. The provinces bordered the HRE and the option was there...he just woudn't accept it.

So ordinarily when the Federal Reserve sells bonds, the effect is **DE**flationary. In this case, since they're selling them to the Treasury, the net effect is zero. Essentially, the government as a whole would be deciding that it owed *itself* less money.

Even if this were not the case, the Fed could still '[sterilize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_\(economics\))' an increase in the money supply by selling off assets in the open market.

Notice I said 'coin' singular. If the government tried this trick multiple times, the Fed would quickly run out of assets to sell.

A party that gets less than 5% will not enter the parliament. So as one can see it's still an open question if the FDP will make it.

Both coalitions are not getting the needed 50% at the moment. Grand coalition with black and red is possible and most likely. Merkel would become chancellor then, because her party will have more seats than Steinbrück's.

Another possibility is black-green (CDU/CSU+Grüne, with Merkel). That would require those conservatives and environmentalists to agree on their programme. This coalition did already happen in some Bundesländer within Germany.

Then there's red-red-green (with Steinbrück). That would be red-green plus the Linke (socialist). That also happened in some Bundesländer. But the SPD stated that they won't work together with the Linke. They fear that they will lose voters if they do.

The train company had 5 000 employeed and the distribution of their yearly income was 60000-110 000 euros with an average at 75000. Their job could be to only check your tickets for 4 hours a day and make 70 000 euros (and that would probably be equivalent to 90 000 in Germany).

Have those people even gotten touched by the measures? Off course not they have political connections.

As for what Sarkozy actually did, he definitely did not put the accent on discussion with the locals or with the youth. After suppressing the Jospin ""police de proximité"" he put into place 6 years later a new version of it (his other muscular approach hadn't worked) called UTEQ. See this [arte page](http://www.arte.tv/fr/Sommet-OTAN-2009/1755842,CmC=2570398.html) for info. The new police is more armed and less aloof than the previous forces. Basically, actual presence of the police works. And before the riots they didn't need to take sticks or bullet-proof vests with them. Sarkozy also put the [previous chief of Raid](http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/sarkozy-relance-sa-politique-de-securite-en-banlieue-20-04-2010-893211.php) as préfet Seine Saint Denis, a very hard liner. The widespread use of the [Brigades anti-criminalités (BAC)](http://www.telerama.fr/idees/les-missions-impossibles-des-brigades-anticriminalite,74241.php), the armed side of the police in charge of arrests, has also been criticized.

Does it matter? My point was right, which you said it wasn't. Europe is not following the treaty and it is a huge democratic deficit. Are you saying that there *isn't* a democratic deficit? 

&gt;ou say yourself that we don't have a working treaty and then blame the ECB for not following it? Make up your mind. A working treaty would leave open the possibility of the ECB acting to inject money directly into the economy, or to act as a lender of last resort, anyway... like any other currency.

The ECB are not elected, they are not a government, who can, like Germany's or France for example, ignore the rules of the Euro convergence criterais. I might not think they are OK, but at least they were elected. The ECB are not elected. They are like judges, accountants etc, there to do what the statue tells them to, not make political deciscions, that affects not only the Eurozone, but the whole world. It is catastrophic when they can not be trusted, and again - *it proves my point about the democratic deficit*. 

So, either start follow the treaty or make a new one. Either, quit with the bailouts, stop buying bonds from individual countries etc - or say that this is not working, let us make a new treaty - and vote about it. 

Also, fire every god damn official who doesn't follow the law. How hard can it be, I hope they fire judges who cheats, and the same thing should go for economists. 

You seem angry, with the way things are and what lead to it and want to cast blame on countries/people, but I do not really see you dispute my point.

There's free choice of schools, so people can pick the establishment of their choice. Basic tuition costs is free, extra costs (excursions etc.) are limited. Schools are being funded based on the number of students enrolled (modified for special needs etc.), if they comply with the prescribed standards. It's still possible do start a school without adhering to those, but you won't receive funding then, necessitating tuition fees. Most schools are of the private-but-state-funded variety (3/4), typically institutions with catholic origins.

Higher education is made up out of a variety of institutions in loose associations around the big universities. There are some tuition fees, but they are limited.

Pros: accessibility. If you're undereducated, it's because of your parents, not because of the school system.

Cons: there's a lower status taint on the more vocationally minded schools, ensuring only the least motivated/talented go there, reinforcing the idea, etc. Vicious cycle.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Of course it's not entirely certain, but unless there are some very big shifts in the few remaining months, she will. The question is what kind of coalition she will cobble together.

You can always find the latest polls from the big pollsters [here](http://www.spiegel.de/flash/0,,21034,00.html).

What you need to know:

Germany uses a system of [mixed-member proportional representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation). The details and the math behind them are complicated, but the main idea is that you have two votes, one for a party and one for a so-called 'direct mandate' which you cast for a person to represent your electoral district on a first-past-the-post base. Half of the seats are reserved for those direct mandates, the other half are for the list candidates of the parties (making for twice as many seats as there are electoral districts). Those other seats are distributed in a way to make the overall distribution of seats (i.e., list candidates plus direct mandates) match the distribution of votes cast for those parties that enter parliament, which means the party vote is the more important one. To enter parliament, a party needs to get at least 5% of the party vote, or at least three direct mandates. 

Edit to make this more clear: You have one vote for the proportional distribution of seats among the parties, and another that determines which candidate will represent your district, with mechanisms to keep the latter from messing up the parties' proportions. The German term for this translates as ""personified proportional representation"" and might be more clear than the English one.

Which possible coalitions are likely:

Almost certainly, no single party will have the necessary majority to form a government on its own, so two or more parties will have to agree to form a coalition. This is where it gets interesting, and 'tactical voters' will take potential coalitions into account when deciding how to vote. (This is where you open the polls in another tab if you haven't yet.)

When discussing possible coalitions in Germany, we usually use color codes. CDU-CSU (Black), the conservatives consisting of the 'sister parties' CDU (all states but Bavaria) and CSU (only Bavaria), the social-democratic SPD (Red), the Greens and almost certainly also the Left (also Red, as in the elusive ""Red-Red""), will enter the parliament. CDU-CSU's current coalition partner, the nominally 'liberal' FDP (Yellow, nowadays more neo-liberal), may or may not manage to take the '5% hurdle', the Pirates and the newly formed anti-euro AfD *might*, but probably won't. Obviously, finding a majority coalition becomes mathematically harder the more of the smaller parties manage to get in.

Politically, some coalitions are preferred, and others all but ruled out. The two traditionally preferred constellations are the current Black-Yellow or Red-Green. If neither is possible, a 'Grand Coalition', meaning Black-Red, is the next option. Beyond those three 'classic' coalitions, it gets complicated, due to antagonism between parties that would have to team up.  

The easy part of unconventional coalition math is that no party will form a coalition with the Left (on federal level), the same is still true for the Pirates (this could change in the future, though) and will most definitely be true for the AfD. So, in practice, those three can be disregarded for this discussion, aside from percentages they take away from the other parties.

Red-Yellow used to be a common coalition, but it's all but ruled out on the federal level nowadays. A 'Traffic Light Coalition' (Red-Green-Yellow) or a 'Jamaica Coalition' (Black-Green-Yellow) would be seen as unstable and gets even more unlikely due to antagonism between the Greens and the FDP.  
I've included the last three for completeness sake, but the forth novelty coalition, Black-Green, is sort of the dark horse in the race that one should keep an eye on. Party strategists on both sides have been toying with this idea for a while now; they know it would be difficult and ruffle some feathers in their respective camps but the want this option on the table to strengthen their negotiating positions in negotiations for other constellations. The thing is that, in Germany, the Greens aren't the kind of anti-establishment radical party they used to be. Their base would not be happy with such a coalition, but if the party leadership manages to negotiate a (very) favorable coalition contract that ticks off enough priority items on their wish list, it's possible. Similarly, since they've supported the economic and welfare reforms as the junior partner in the Red-Green coalition under Chancellor Schröder, and even lead the coalition with the SPD in the important and traditionally conservative state of Baden-Württemberg with their quite popular Minister-President (head of government/state) Kretschmann, they have lost much of their fear factor and became palatable for parts of the conservative establishment as well.

Foreign commentators will tell you that Merkel fears to lose her coalition partner if the FDP wouldn't make it into parliament this time, but the opposite is true. The current coalition is dysfunctional and Black-Yellow polls unusually low in terms of favored constellations. Traditionally, conservative tactical voters will 'lend' their vote to the FDP to help their preferred coalition partner over the 5%, and we will see some of that as well, but Merkel has signaled that this isn't desired behavior this time around. If the FDP gets in, she'll be put into a position where a continuation of the current coalition will be expected, but it's been such a mess that she doesn't want that. You'll hear plenty of pledges by the SPD and the Greens that they intend to form a coalition together, and you'll hear the same about the current constellation from the FDP, but my guess is that there won't be much more than lip service from the CDU-CSU. They could do without the FDP, mathematically and politically a coalition without a broad black streak won't be possible, and they could most certainly do without this empty shell of a party under a volatile leadership. What's more, in their fight for survival the FDP severely restricts Merkel's options in the Eurocrisis, a coalition with either the SPD or the Greens would open more possibilities -- even if those might be less popular among her own base.

It's not unreasonable to adress the lack of demand, but personally, if that's the goal, I would do it by directly putting money into the hands of the consumers (eg. 50 € for every European citizen), rather than working through governments.

&gt;Of what? That we should spend our way out of a crisis made by excessive public spending? Yeah, not really, we're going to stick through with the reforms, balance the budget and liberalise the economy.
It's the only if we ever want to achieve a stable, sustainable and prosperous economy.

That leads to cultural factors in the work place that are stopping women from getting them. Now, things have slowly been getting better for women, this corporate culture is slowly being demolished.

No. Where did you get that? I'm saying how we arrived at that point, and what stops us from fixing it.

&gt;I might not think they are OK, but at least they were elected. 

Most governments aren't elected, but appointed, by a parliament for example.

&gt;They are like judges, accountants etc, there to do what the statue tells them to, not make political deciscions, that affects not only the Eurozone, but the whole world. It is catastrophic when they can not be trusted, and again - it proves my point about the democratic deficit.

While I agree about the democratic deficit, no, that doesn't prove your point at all. The existence of non-elected institutions is not necessarily a sign of a democratic deficit, neither judges nor road workers are elected, but they are evidently useful parts of a state. The ECB fits in that list.

&gt;So, either start follow the treaty or make a new one.

They are now developing new practices. One of the things that make politics difficult is that you have to keep everything running while making changes. What you want is to shut down the computer, install a new OS, and start it up again. But we can't: the computer has to keep running at any time.

* Technical/vocational/trade school. Usually very weak pupils, and I very much disagree with this.

* Drop out of school altogether.

Upon completion of the first two, students take the exam for entrance to Greek and Cypriot universities and other higher learning institutions. Everything is free up to your first degree.

Private schools and universities also exist. Private schools are prepping students for entrance to British/French/German/American universities and are usually very good, but expensive. Other than networking, there isn't a perceivable advantage to private school students, except perhaps stronger foreign language skills. One good thing going for them is the attention given to students due to all-day teaching and smaller class size. Public school students are practically expected to get after-school tutoring, but we're experimenting with all-day public schools and the results so far are promising.

Private universities, on the other hand, aren't exactly top notch. They were only recently allowed to call themselves ""universities"" and they're trying to build a reputation, but historically they were attended by students who failed to get into public universities in Greece and Cyprus and couldn't afford or didn't want to go abroad.

Yes, I also think that there should be more women in those jobs relative to men as well. But I also recognize that there is a negligible level of demand from women to get into those jobs, so instituting a quota would be ineffective. If you want women to get into those jobs, we need to change as a society to start ignoring gender differences at early ages (for example, not teaching that girls should like dolls and guys should like trucks) and allowing people to have the freedom to pursue whatever choices they want in life without having undue pressure put on them based on their gender.

&gt;That would be the failure of feminism, like someone said. It'd send a message that women can never be at the same level as men, without government helping them out with quotas.

Sure, some people would think that. Or some people might think it's removing a corporate culture that's preventing women from getting jobs. In 20-30 years when things even out and the corporate culture I mentioned is dismantled, the law can be repealed (though I'd prefer a timed law - ie, one that expires after 30 years).

true,canteloupy,ZBSuisse,Suisse,"&gt;This has been proven wrong : race only comes as the 4th criteria, behing sex (boys are more controlled than girls), age, and clothes.

So it does still get minority banlieue youth controlled more often than others. The controls on minorities are much more disrespectful as was outlined in my sources, the ""tutoiement"" is a very recognized aspect of it that mostly affect minority youth in the banlieue. The police antagonize the people there more than anywhere else. They try to manipulate the data by claiming it's how it's ""perceived"" but it's fairly obvious that it's not conducted in the same way in Neuilly as in St Denis.

Actually reading the report shows that clothing and minority status was a confounding factor, and both were actually equally predictive. It's difficult to say which is the dominant one in these conditions. In fact in what concerns my main points, the authors of the report agree with me :

&gt;En visant certaines personnes à cause de ce qu’elles sont (ou ont l’air d’être) et non à cause de ce qu’elles ont fait ou font, les policiers perpétuent des stéréotypes sociaux et raciaux. L’attention accrue que  a police accorde à certaines personnes peut entraîner une augmentation des conflits avec la police, lourds de conséquences à la fois pour la sécurité du public et pour celle des fonctionnaires eux-mêmes. Une relation police-public insatisfaisante suscite une  méfiance envers la police et ne prédispose pas les gens à la soutenir, ce qui diminue son efficacité en matière de prévention et de détection des crimes et des délits. Les contrôles de police ont d’ailleurs été des éléments déterminants à l’arrière-plan d’émeutes urbaines majeures au Royaume-Uni, aux États-Unis et en France.
&gt;Les effets négatifs du contrôle au faciès en France se sont reflétés dans une série d’émeutes violentes qui ont ébranlé la France au cours des deux dernières décennies, les plus récentes étant celles de 2005 et 2007. Ils se font sentir aussi dans les altercations quotidiennes qui ont lieu entre la police et les jeunes d’origine immigrée ; et dans la perte de confiance envers le système de la justice pénale française.

The excuse that the justice system won't punish them so the police ""has to"" do something is bullshit. It's not up to them to decide without lawyers present who deserves the punishment.

I've been to the Netherlands several times and I have never come across a dutch person that was rude.
Dutch people tend to be a lot more open than Germans, too. Germans are way more reserved to strangers. I remember when I was at a music festival (I believe it was Trance Energy), I was so exhausted that I sat down on the floor. It took only a couple of seconds until another person asked me whether everything was OK and offered me some water. This sign of care for strangers is something that I haven't come across as often in Germany.

The Dutch also have a good taste in music from what I can tell. Some of the best electronic music events take place in the Netherlands. (Trance Energy, Mysteryland, all the Q-Dance events, etc.)
The Dutch also seem to be a lot more into electronic music in general. When your national team came back from the 2010 World Cup, they celebrated with Armin van Buuren. How cool is that? Something like that is very unlikely in Germany. German EDM producers like Paul van Dyk don't get enough mainstream attention to allow them to play for the national team.

As far as your language goes: I don't know why, but to Germans, Dutch sounds extremely funny. Doesn't matter what you say. When Germans laugh at the Dutch language, it's not meant to be insulting at all, it just sounds hilarious.

The alternative would be to have the state keep paying for people who do not contribute anything to the real economy and society, which is what created the problem in the first place.

1. The fact that unemployment is high somehow justifies laying off people, thereby exacerbating the problem? 

2. Who said that state employees contribute nothing to society? You think the schools, hospitals etc work by themselves? 

3. Who says that an overblown public sector was instrumental to creating the problem in the first place? The principle reason of the Greek problems is the global financial crisis and the eurozone construction errors. Even if you're only looking for domestic problems, the size of the public compares pretty favourably with other countries. It's not having globally competitive industries, corruption and tax evasion that are the most important problems. 

&gt; Greece is a special case in that its corrupt public sector is the biggest employer and most private companies depend on working with it.

&gt;Everyone should ask all unemployed, all retired people and all students by what right they just assume that you should pay for their livelihood or their education.

At another occasion he wrote in favor of denying unemployed people the right to vote. A member of their scientific council also supported the idea of not allowing unemployed people to run in an election 'to protect the elite'. 

It's hardly an accident that those people are at the top. If they actually manage to get popular the other parties will have a field day with the attack on retirement benefits.

First, the term ""The we"": It means as much as ""what concerns us all, what holds us together, what we're doing together"". It is not referring to any person or group that takes a decision, but, approximately, to solidarity.

Next, ""decides"". While ""entscheiden"" means ""to decide"", if it is something, not someone that's deciding it also means ""calls the shots"", as in ""brings something about"".

Taken together, another meaning opens up: ""The we is of prime importance to what we do"".

My English might just not be good enough, but I wager it's completely untranslatable: The German has all three meanings, interlacing and overlapping, depending on how you squint at it, and finding an equivalent or even merely comparable connotation bomb in English is *not* going to be trivial.

true,vangelisc,EURO,European Union,"1. Unemployment is high because there are people being laid off in the private sector. Companies have been closing because of higher taxes, the state not paying its bills and diminishing demand. The Greek state pays for the salaries in the public sector, which includes trains, buses, electricity unlike other European countries. In a capitalist economy jobs are supposed to be created by the private sector, which in Greece is non-existing. If the state becomes smaller it is likely that bureaucracy will be reduced and creating a company will become easier. Economic development in market economies comes from private entrepreneurship not public expenditure. The solution cannot be for the state to hire more people in order to fight unemployment. At least not in the context of the EU, which requires free markets.

2. I was thinking of people being paid by the state to work in administrative positions, even though they cannot use a computer and those who do not show up for work and still get paid. Many of the people who work for the state are there because of their political affiliation, not their skills.
Of course I'm not saying that health and education should be privatised or that there should be lay-offs there.

3. The global financial crisis meant that the Greek state could not borrow money from private markets. But there was a need to borrow in the first place. If Greece had not been spending more than it produced the impact of the financial crisis would not have been as great.

&gt; The state plays a huge role in most other countries too. The corruption is a problem but it won't be fixed by laying off people. 

Political parties have put those people in work in exchange for their vote. How else can this vicious circle break?

It's also in Basic Economics 101 - if there's less confidence in a market it goes down.  If you adopt a myriad of existing problems into your own then you lose confidence in your own system.   

If the housing crisis is too much like yesterday's news then the same thing happened in the banking crisis when the UK ended up having to back door bailout Irish banks because UK banks were exposed.  

If a veritable yesterday isn't close enough to home - the Cypriot crisis is in no small part because they in turn were exposed to Greek bonds.

Another good bet for cheap eats and good atmosphere would be Alfalfa. I have been told it often gets overrun by Erasmus students, but personally I like the area.

Where to buy decent ingredients would depend on the location of your apartment. There are various markets dotted around, some cheaper than others.

I was talking about what led to the crisis, what, is it supposed to be deleted from history? Not that there aren't certain agencies where that shit is still happening. 

A highschool teacher, only needs to work 15 hours a week for 9 months, has no risk of getting fired, and can make an extra 400+ euros in private lessons (since unlike every other employee he only needs to stay at school 3 hours a day instead of 8), and he can in the end still make more money than the aforementioned factory worker who has to wake up at 6 am get to the other side of the city work for 10-12 hours, and the way it is right now be under constant threat of unemployement.

But let's concentrate on the overpaid syndicalist ""deko"" cancer, since the teachers really aren't making too much anymore. The amount of people who were making the 50000+ salary for little work, work that the state could currently (or even back then, guess what kind of hiring policy they used) easily find an unskilled worker to do for only 12000, are altogether close to 80K. 

They charged the greek state for almost biilion a year. How can we just ""reduce their wages a bit move on and forget"", those people used that money to buy 5 appartments each, or buy tourist rooms, open restaurants etc. I didn't have to do with the shit they were stealing all right, why do I have to face a dysfunctional economic environment with little in private sector businesses and the public sector being closed due to those shitheads not getting fired and still receiving money while me and my friends who never did business with the indebted greek state might at any day get unemployed for months. You think that's fair? What are they the syndicalist aristocracy?

They basically got rich via a scam and now I'm still supposed to treat them like the socialist proletariat when the grandpa that goes at the PAME demonstrations has 3 summer houses and 4 city appartments. Fuck them, there is a social contract in Greece that no one will directly attack this whole system, but if the situation doesn't change in the next 5 years sooner or later people will get sick of being treated like second rate citizens as the syndicalist fight the power or whatever they pretend to do.

Our voting system is slightly complicated. 

There are so called direct mandates, basically if a candidate for parliaments wins in his/her electoral district, that is a direct mandate. Now if a party has at least three such ""district winners"" The party gets into the parliament even if it has below 5% of the votes. Their seats are then counted according to their percentage. This happened the last time in 1994 though: The left wing PDS got only 4.4% of the vote, but 4 direct mandates =&gt; due to the 4.4% share of the votes this meant 30 seats in parliament.

And if this is not complicated enough for you, we can do better ;) 
Should it happen that a party has more direct mandates than the seats they would have gotten due to the percentage of the vote... they will get extra seats. This mostly happens with the big two main parties as most district winners come from one of those two.

&gt;""You cannot say right now, in the current situation, that we will create a eurobond. On the other hand, we should not exclude it in the medium-to-long term. The first step is to boost trust and growth. After some years, it might make sense to have common issuance of bonds. But it’s not a decision we can take now. The key reason for putting our debt together is not the eurocrisis, it’s the reason we adopted the euro in the first place. It’s to have a global reserve currency, with a deep and liquid bond market.""

Il punto è questo: l'informazione è un'industria. Peculiare finché si vuole, ma è un'industria. Questo implica che i soggetti che agiscono all'interno di questa industria si muovono secondo le sue logiche, che sono diverse e spesso legate tra loro. Logiche commerciali (quali interessi fare per ottenerne quale ritorno), logiche di mercato (quale bacino di utenza da intercettare in quale modo), logiche di potere (influenzare che cosa, in quale ambito, per ottenerne cosa). Natura e finalità del prodotto editoriale dipendono da come ci si muove all'interno di queste logiche.

Nonostante la sintesi brutalissima, è abbastanza chiaro che la materia è talmente complessa che pretendere che si possa tirare una riga coi buoni di qua e i cattivi di là è da scemi. Nonostante questo, si tirano righe a tutto andare. Perché? Perché l'informazione ha avuto in sorte un bacino di mercato fortissimamente polarizzato, con una mentalità generale abbastanza simile a quella dei tifosi. Una delle esigenze primarie del lettore (o telespettatore, o cliccatore) collettivo è essere costantemente confortato nella convinzione che la propria parte ha ragione anche oggi mentre le altre parti sono piene di stronzi anche oggi. Conseguentemente, quanto più gli provvedi conferme circa la sua visione del mondo, più l'utente tenderà ad identificarti come imparziale/coraggioso/onesto: ti sta dando ragione perché tu gli hai dato ragione.

One would be the inscription on your cigarettes: ""Roken is dodelijk"" (yes, I had to look that up). It's just hilarious. Not only does it sound really funny on its own, it also sounds very similar to ""dödelig"" which is like a mild child's version of stupid in German.

I had some Dutch lesson some time which I have mostly forgotten, but there was one thing that stuck with me. A way of saying that you will show someone to the door was something like ""Ich laufe mit dir bis bei die Tür."" which, while perfect Dutch just sounds funny again, again in a mix between the inept way children would express such a thought as well as sounding like a clichée person from the Ruhr who also uses the same kind of bad standard grammar.

true,CapitaineFlemme,null,null,"&gt;So it does still get minority banlieue youth controlled more often than others.

Yes, but it's not as important as sex or age. Do you suggest that women or elder people should be more controlled ? The ""minority"" vision is a biased one made up by journalist who deliberately want to ignore the most important age + sex + clothes ones.

&gt;They try to manipulate the data by claiming it's how it's ""perceived"" but it's fairly obvious that it's not conducted in the same way in Neuilly as in St Denis.

My quote was from the CNRS' study, not the police interpretation. The real manipulation is the ethnic vision, for ethnicity is only the 4th factor. The most important discrimination of the police is a sexual and misandrist discrimination. This is what the study says, but no one wants to discuss it. Do you think it's normal ?

One might suggest that young men from minorities are more likely to have a problem with authority (school, parents or police) than others. 

One might think that it comes **partly** from the cultural background and education, or lack of. So police discrimination is a factor, social class is a factor, but I agree with some of the points raised by ""La France Orange Mécanique"" (although half of the book is propaganda) : adding money or social workers will not solve the problem, they have some responsibility and have to reconsider how they see their place in France. Also, immigration has to be controlled.

I've been living in banlieues for 17 years. Some high/middle class (Fontainebleau, Marly-Le-Roi, Saint-Maur), some poor (Nanterre, Aulnay-sous-Bois, Noisy-Le-Grand). I've also been living in Grenoble and Antibes. Their behavior was always the same, so I'm sure that the problem was not due to the ""banlieue"" environment.

&gt;The excuse that the justice system won't punish them so the police ""has to"" do something is bullshit.

I agree that punishing is not their job, their job is executive / security but this cannot be achieved if the ""delinquants"" do not respect police forces. How can they respect police forces if they are unpunished ?",0,1366131395,null,0,false,0,c9gdg6w,t3_1cdn6v,t1_c9gdg6w,t1_c9g9i6h,null,1431537341,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

&gt; The point of democracy is to see which viewpoint has majority backing. 

Who cares about democracy anyway? If the Nazis didn't care about democracy why should you?

&gt; The people of Turkey seem to have decided that anti-blasphemy laws reflect their popular opinion and I respect that, even if I disagree. 

Why do you respect that? And do you respect UK's right not to respect Turkish sovereignty if they manage to mount a successful invasion?

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"Not at all all legislation passes both organs, their legislative competences are strictly defined in the constitution.

The Bundesrat has to *agree* to everything concerning:

* Changes to the constitution (2/3rd majority in both organs, and no changing of invariant sections)

* Any law affecting the finances of the states in any way whatsoever

* If their administrative sovereignty is concerned

On top of that, the Bundesrat can *challenge* legislation passed by the Bundestag:

* If they challenge it with a simple majority, then the Bundestag needs to pass it with a simple majority, again (which is rather silly as it already did that, but you send a message)

* If they challenge it with a 2/3rd majority, the Bundestag needs to pass it again with a 2/3rd majority. Which they probably won't be able to do.

Irrespective of all that, they may pass any legislation they bloody well please, but then the Bundestag still has to agree, that is, they can take initiative in any field. They just did that, by passing a law on minimum wage, with was a political stunt of the predominantly Red/Green state governments. You have to kick off the election season with something, you know.

In general: Legislative power of the Bundesrat is actually only strong when it comes to matters that affect the states directly. In all other cases, it merely serves as a check that can increase the bar legislation has to pass.

German states have less legislative power as in the US, for example, criminal law is a completely federal matter. But they also have the guarantee not to be encroached upon in their dedicated areas, like police, culture, education, media as well as internal structure and constitution. And exactly because of this separation of competencies the Bundesrat being made up of the state governments isn't undemocratic, at all. 

We also don't have those federal vs. state debates. Having two parties that differ on virtually no issue but whether the states or the federation should have all power is rather alien...
