&gt;You think a half French half British Armed forces would work any better?

You think a part English part Scottish armed forces would work? 'cos there were people 200 years ago who didn't.

&gt;They speak different languages

Except that everyone growing up in the EU is now learning English, and half of the EU already speaks it fluently, especially younger people. So, to an extent the above isn't true, and rapidly it's becoming less and less true.

&gt;Italy has a larger economy than India. Germany has a larger economy than the whole of Mercosur put together.

*for now*. Also have you looked at growth rates? Between 1990 and 2006 the Chinese economy grew about 325%, the UK one by less than 50%, and Italy's by maybe 25%. European countries are all similar on this. We've punched above our population weight because other countries have been poor and shitty and undeveloped, but they're developing now, and fast, and we're losing our advantage. India's GDP is projected to be larger than Chinas currently is by 2050, growing all the time to get there. That is possible, maybe even likely. Italy's GDP will not by that size at 2050. If we're lucky, Italy's GDP will have undergone steady low rate growth for those years.

&gt;However we don't need it for defence, we have a powerful enough Armed forces,

Actually our armed forces are day by day being weakened and are less effective, but I didn't say we *needed* it for defence, I said it would be beneficial in many regards.

&gt;We don't need it to negotiate our trade agreements, we have excellent agreements with many commonwealth states

Oh this is utter tosh, if we ""didn't need it"" then why wasn't free trade in place in Europe prior to the EEC/EU? We don't *have* free trade with India or Pakistan, and having a few bilateral agreements in no way compares to having a free trade zone.

&gt;and any nation who doesn't want to trade with the UK will only be shooting themselves in the foot.

It's not about that though and no-one ever said it was.

&gt;So as I said, we give the EU money, we get discounted food.

If you choose to look at it that way then sure. I tend to take the view that since without the CAP we'd have more money but food would cost around the same (just not be European) that the CAP is a form of wealth distribution, but we both know what it is so I'm happy enough.

&gt;I pointed out the number of agricultural workers has fallen but the CAP budget hasn't really. In 10 years (97-07) the agriculture, forestry, fishing &amp; hunting sector shrank by 27.5%. That's significant.

That's fantastic, consolidation is exactly what we want. CAP pays based on land held, and so land is being consolidated by farmers who stay in the business while others get out of it. This is *precisely* what we want.

&gt;The CAP isn't a transitional allowance, it's a way of making the EU worthwhile for Western Europe. Eastern Europe is one of the markets that causes us to 'need' the CAP!

I disagree that it's not transitional, but not quite sure I understand what you mean by that bit about western europe. Are you referring to the fact that western european nations take 3/4 of the CAP home, or that because eastern european food is cheaper western european farms have to be subsidised?

Either way, I fail to see how that would go against my point that the CAP is there to allow a steady and stable reform of the farming industry. The no.1 goal of the CAP as laid out in the treaty of Rome is to increase productivity and maximisation of labour potential (i.e. use fewer people better for more land).

&gt;You say people vote as individuals, but that's not true. Just a short while before you were talking about how the French are looking after France's interests.

The French government, sure. This is a problem we face by having national governments still, and the sooner we disentangle the EU level governance from national level governance the better. There are many common goals and achivements towards which some in the EU will be for and others against, and increasingly those are not along national lines.

&gt;People vote for their country's benefit.

I think people vote for their *own* benefit, and that doesn't always accord with what's good for the majority in their country, and that's fair enough and a good thing.

&gt;I get the feeling you want the EU to be a country where I'm not British, I'm European.

You'll be both, just as I'm currently Scottish and also British. Hell, you already are both, it's just right now your passport says UK (although is still an EU passport, notably).

&gt;Many people in the past have tried to merge Europe, it keeps splitting back up again. It seems to be the natural way of things, the 'equilibrium' if you will.

It's never been tried like this before. This is the first european empire/nation/grouping to ever have expanded its borders by consensus within and without the union.

&gt;A Maltan having 176 times the voting power of a German is undemocratic, I agree. It doesn't make it ridiculous. Smell the cheese, when has your vote ever made a difference anyway?

Every time I've used it. Malta having the same power of Germany in voting terms splits up nations purely based on national interests, it's not just anti-democratic but it's also intentionally divisive and to do that is to build a flaw into the organisation. Voting must be democratic, which means 500 million votes on EU wide referendums, and proportional voting and representation within the parliament etc.

The stuff you say about the American electoral collage system, so what? We don't have that system, you're *arguing* for it, but there's no reason to go forward building that system into the European Union.

&gt;I don't want the EU to attempt (and fail) to represent me, it will never be what I'd like, realistically I have too little influence.

Oh wake up man won't you? You think you have tangibly different levels of influence in a nation of 62,000,000 people? Are you insane?

&gt;I'm perfectly happy if that means some dude in Malta statistically has a higher chance of influencing the world than I do, at the end of the day none of it is down to either of us.

I would explain democracy to you, but I'm quite sure you're versed in the details and just being perverse in this case. You simultaneously argue for an intentional weakening of democratic values while arguing that it doesn't work because...well it doesn't work because of the anti-democratic stuff like having unequal voting power. Circular reasoning.

&gt;EDIT: I personally feel you're being very idealistic, where I'm trying to be more realistic.

And I think you're being tremendously short sighted. You think the UK can remain relevant, with a high standard of living, and maintain world power into the future. We can not on our own.

Sorry but no, I've had a look around. They all refer to it as discrimination based on ""race"", race being the antiquated 19th century term for concepts related to skin colour and based in genetics.

&gt;And science.

Science doesn't define words except words which relate to science, which *ethnocentrism* does not, nor does *racism* really.

&gt;Jews were considered a ""non-white"" race just 50 years ago. There is no good reason to separate discrimination based on race from discrimination based on ideas of race, and that's what's at play here.

I'm sorry, have you read what I said *at all?* I literally just said in my last post that racism, discrimination based on skin colour or genetic history, is stupid, and irrational.

&gt;I don't really care what ""most people"" think, because in this case they're wrong. Ethnography is a science, and it defines its terms quite clearly.

Well, yes, to an extent I agree. In an academic context I accept the word means what you say it does, unfortunately words are defined by mass consent, and as such words can mean one thing in a scientific context and another in a more general context. I don't really see how ethnography is a science unless you're meaning genetics. Seems more like an arts subject to me.

&gt;My point is that you will often make assumptions about which culture someone is from based on their appearance

By how they dress, walk, talk, express themselves, their accent, their expressions, their car, their house. Yes. I do make judgements about other people based on these things. We all do. That's part of being human.

&gt;and you will just as often hold misconceptions about any foreign culture

Yes, of course. So what? So my value judgements are sometimes inaccurate, that doesn't mean I (or anyone else, because we all do this) is going to stop making them.

&gt;Indeed, an anthropologist who doesn't share your background may easily make the argument that it is typical of Western, especially British, culture, which mostly consists of white people, to consider their own culture superior to any other, and that this is part of the explanation for the exceedingly bloody history of our culture, as well as our historical desire to conquer and subjugate all foreign, ""inferior"" cultures.

Oh I don't consider my culture superior to all others. There are many exceedingly impressive cultures out there. But some are actually just pretty shitty on the balance of things.

You know I didn't used to think like this. I used to be a cultural relativist. Then I found out the levels of FGM in many cultures, I found out about the practise of Bacha Bazi in Pashtun culture.

It does mention that before 2003, credits have been very insufficient for the current level of the army (they go as far as to say a 40% raise would have been necessary) and that the sectors that were cut were maintenance and ammo. It says that the situation improved between 2003-2008 without still fixing it totally. The war in Libya has been made more difficult because of a lack of ammunition at a crucial moment (especially bombs for bomber planes).

Be careful however that the public wisdom on this kind of questions may be old news. In France we like to talk how our country sucks and dysfunctions, but when something is fixed, it is usually not newsworthy.

On our troops and its bravery, I think we do not have to be particularly ashamed of any cowardice. We have had a very strong and efficient army for most of our history. WWII tend to make people forget this fact, but if you are interested, you should look at how half of the French army continued to fight even after the government surrendered. There is some epic bravery there.

Algeria and Indochina, on the other hand, are widely seen as shameful conflicts. We were the bad guys there. In Indochina, we clearly fought as a colonial power against the will of the locals. In Algeria, the conflict is known to have involved far too much civilian casualties and many prisoners tortured.

We are not in Afghanistan anymore, but from what I heard, we can be fairly proud of what we did there militarily speaking. I personally think the US bears the responsibility of the political failure.

The operations in Irak War I seem to have been good too.

Our troops have been apparently very cold-headed during the Ivory-Coast crisis too. 

France probably has a very dirty responsibility in the Rwandan genocide but unfortunately the judicial process is hindered by politicians there.

true,LooksLikeANewAccount,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Bigger nations isn't better.

I want free trade. With everyone. The EU hinders that.

I want a balance of power to exist in global politics, I don't want one hegemonic EU country. 

I don't want us all to vote on one 'president'. Some countries prefer much more liberal governance, others prefer more conservative governance. 

&gt; This is the first european empire/nation/grouping to ever have expanded its borders by consensus within and without the union.

No it isn't. If you can give me a poll saying 75%+ want the EU to be a country then I'll start taking that idea seriously. That would be getting close to a consensus. 

I think the UK can remain relevant. If India has a higher GDP that doesn't make it more powerful. Their education system fails more students than the UK, they have serious infrastructure issues to resolve, their GDP per capita is minuscule, etc. If India's population doubles and it's GDP only increase 1.5 fold then they are poorer. They have not had real growth. 

Isreal's economy is almost exactly 1/10th of ours and they are still relevant.

I'm also a supporter of the idea of stopping growth at some point for many nations. If you look at the earth in terms of capital then we have human capital, natural capital and machine capital. We can consume human and machine capital and still replace it, but much natural capital is irreplaceable. The earth has what environmental economists call a 'carrying capacity', we exceed that. The goal of the UK isn't to influence the world, it's to ensure its citizens are able to live their lives how they like. This only requires everyone to have access to education, healthcare, jobs, land and food. Once our population has stopped growing (which is has by births, indeed births are falling) our source of growth purely lies in productivity gains. If these productivity gains offset falling birthrate then we have a steady state economy. What I would class as the ultimate goal of economics.

EDIT: back on democracy. I like the aspect of democracy which allows a significant public opinion change to replace governments, this means governments try to act in the interests of the people. I can also write to my MP or discuss alternative ideas with you, I think the culture of democracy is what is important. 

I do think I have more power in the UK than in Europe. My MP represents a smaller number than my EMP. So if I wrote to both I would have a higher chance of my MP bringing my idea to parliament then my EMP. With my vote I agree with you, it doesn't have any more power in the UK than is does in the EU.",0,1358693076,null,0,1358693341,0,c809bfm,t3_16ty4z,t1_c809bfm,t1_c8092gf,null,1431021408,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

2. Transgression in culture, language and literature  

3. Rhetoric - The anti-rhetorical tradition

4. Role of formalism in linguistics

5. Subjectivity in grammar.

I have a Dutch friend here at AUP who uses a grant by the Dutch government with no problem. Unfortunately, I don't know what the situation is for English students. I'm sure google.co.uk can help ;)

I know there are more English speaking universities that exist around here, but I don't know many by name.

 Schiller International University, NYU Paris, and..  I found a link! http://www.campusfrance.org/fria/taughtie/index.html?mfid=6#app=bad0&amp;dd33-si=0

It's not like it wasn't redundant from the beginning and just built so that the corruptest of the public sector contractors would get a cut from the easy EU loans.

You are an idiot. The infrastructure is an asset, it's capital. You can use it to generate revenue or fulfil basic social needs. Electricity, water etc are all natural monopolies. And they produce profits for the Greek state. Just read the freaking article. 

&gt; the rest of the stuff to be sold is currently either unused, or used for shit that doesn't matter, or no one in the public sector has any concrete plans or funds on how to use them, or the companies in question are running at huge debts and/or (the gambling company) essentially run monopolies.

Again, read the article. The assets to be sold with the privatisation programme are not the ones running debts. Also, no effort will be made to break up any monopolies. So, the privatisation solves neither of the very real problems you mentioned.

&gt; Yeah sure the EU backed telecommunications privatization totally turned out to be a loss to the greek consumer.

Um, I agree that the telecommunications landscape is better now. But still, if OTE stayed in public hands, a functioning democracy could exert pressure for it to reform. And the only thing that stops this from being a disaster is that telephony is easier to structure as a competition-based industry, the only inefficiency introduced is the fact that you need to separate the lines operator from the consumer-end service providers.

So you want to go to Italy eh. First things first, stay in Siena, not Florence. You can visit Florence in two days if you are productive and Siena is so nice it cannot be missed.
If you stay there, there is a beautiful hotel called borgo grondaie. A little bit out of the city (at the bottom of the hill), but has great grounds to relax on and it's pretty easy to get into the city by bus or moving staircase.

For cinque terre I would suggest searching in the town of la spezia. It's kind of like the transit hub of the cinque terre region. Plenty of hotels to choose from, ten minute train ride from cinque terre.

For Roma, I would suggest hotel Santa Maria if you can splurge a little bit, it's a great hotel in a beautiful part of town (trastevere).

If you go out to eat:

Siena - osteria del gatto
Rome - spirito divino

Mettere un file CSV online così, per poter dire ai talk show ""noi i dati li mettiamo su internet"", come questo caso dimostra, non necessariamente genera quel controllo che il cittadino dovrebbe esercitare nei confronti della pubblica amministrazione in maniera automatica. Non so se sono il primo a mettere il naso lì dentro - sicuramente non sono stati in tanti perchè  se faccio ""centro"" prendendo il primo nome a cazzo temo che quello che ho beccato io non sia un caso isolato.

Quindi, la pubblicazione dei dati di per sè stessa non causa nessuna reazione a livello popolare - anche se, come in questo caso, i dati la reazione la inviterebbero. Quello che servirebbe è una bella webapp che permette da una parte al cittadino di filtrare e raggruppare per vari criteri, dall' altra alle aziende che fatturano al comune di Firenze di avere una propria pagina con all' interno chi è il proprietario e tutto il necessario per permettere al cittadino di verificare che effettivamente non ci siano state ""scorrettezze"" nell' assegnamento dell' appalto - con il Comune di Firenze ad obbligare tutte le aziende fatturanti a compilare correttamente tale pagina.

E, naturalmente, quello che servirebbe davvero sarebbe anche l' iniziativa del cittadino, che questi dati li dovrebbe guardare come guarda quelli del suo conto in banca - alla fine, sono soldi suoi. Questo in Italia non avviene - perchè la cosa pubblica è cosa di nessuno, non cosa di tutti - e finchè le cose staranno così nessuna webapp potrà risolvere la situazione.

I saw this thread at 17:45 and was confused for a moment. I searched for and cheeked the notice I had gotten in the mail weeks ago and saw that: yes, the election was today and it was open until 6 and the school where I was supposed to vote was only a few minutes away if you ran really fast.

At that point it was already 17:48 and I decided to put on my pants despite it being Sunday.

I ran as fast as an out of shape Nerd with untied shoelaces possibly could. The fastest way of course was covered in snow, uphill and insufficiently lit, but knowing my responsibility I pushed on.

I arrived at the voting locale with minutes to spare to witness the officials declaring a bet among themselves as won. Seemingly I was the one person to reach the limit on the voter turnout during the last hour that they bet upon. I was also the last voter.

Anxiously I grabbed the ballot and went behind the screen.

I am reasonably sure that in all the excitement I actually made the x in the place I intended to and that I didn't accidentally vote for the Party of Bible loyal Christ.

When I left the to place the church bells struck 6 and the elction was officially over.

Eben nicht.

Weimar ist hauptsächlich daran gescheitert, dass die überwiegende Mehrheit der Republik ablehnend gegenüberstand. Auch wirtschaftlich konnten die wenigen Demokraten die Bevölkwerung kaum überzeugen (wobei das in den Boomphasen durchaus funktionierte). *mir ist durchaus bewußt, dass diese Darstellung sehr kurzgefasst ist*

Ob nun am Ende statt der braunen die roten regiert hätten, die Republik hätte das nicht überlebt. (evtl. hätte die SPD den Niedergang noch hinauszögern können - das ist aber alles zu spekulativ)

&gt; ...und ganz am Rande: Käme ein linker oder rechter Rattenfänger mit &gt; Hitlers und Goebbels Potential um die Ecke, dann gnade uns Gott. 
&gt; Denn die Masse wartet auf den Erlöser, auch wenn die aktuell 
&gt; dilettierenden Demokraten das nicht sehen wollen.

Hier gebe ich dir vollkommen Recht, aber genau aus diesem Grund sollte man das jetzige System, als Kompromiß stützen (zumal es sich durchaus als reformfähig erwiesen hat). Sicher kann man es kritisieren und auch mit einigen Dingen nicht einverstanden sein, aber unterm Strich kann man sich als rechter wie auch als linker - wenn auch, in beiden Fällen, zähneknirschend - mit ihm arrangieren. Ein Systemwechsel würde die relativ empfindliche Balance zu ungunsten aller stören. Unabhänig welche Seite die Oberhand gewönne, die andere würde entsprechend reagieren - dessen sollte sich jeder bewußt sein.

Und genau aus diesem Grund ist es m.E. falsch sich aus dem gesellschaftlichen/politischen Diskurs zu verabschieden oder gar gleich eine Antihaltung einzunehmen.

The point is that Frankfurt is among the most criminal cities in all of Germany, thus people seem to think it's also the most dangerous. What many don't understand is that most crime in Frankfurt happens in other ""fields"". We have a high rate of economic crime (tax evasion, fraud etc.) because we are the banking capital of Germany. We also have lots of smuggling and illegal immigration due to the Airport, and are the proud home to some of the most notorious football hooligans in the entire country. 

Add that to the fact that Frankfurt is a commuter city (650.000 actual citizens, but during daytime there are usually over 1 million people inside the city borders, whose crimes also count towards our crime statistic) and it looks like we are the epicentre of crime for all of Germany. But our violent crime rates are not really above standard, and actual robberies, murders and rapes are as rare as they are everywhere else in Germany. Just going about your day in every part of the city is not more dangerous than it is in Munich or Hamburg or Cologne, but due to the factors I mentioned above we ""won"" the title of most criminal city in Germany 22 times in the last 25 years :-)

I believe in full equality between men and women.  In fact, I believe even more: I think it's none of the state's business to know whether I'm male or female (any more than my ethnic type, hair color, blood group, or that sort of things: the fact that my cells have a Y chromosome in them or that I have a pair of testicles is something that concerns me, perhaps my lovers and my doctors, but it shouldn't be anyone else's business and it shouldn't be put on file except if I allow it), and I think, e.g., allowing same-sex marriage should be a trivial corollary of the fact that ""sex"" shouldn't even be a legally defined category.

But I can understand why the above would be kind of controversial and why some people might disagree (I'm willing to defend my position but I'm not sure whether this is the right place).  However, when it comes to conscription, the discrimination is so blatant that I can't even imagine how one could defend drafting only males (especially given that basically every country now allows women in the army).",0,1358707042,null,0,false,0,c80cv5y,t3_16xfz8,t1_c80cv5y,t1_c80bx4h,null,1431023002,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Although if this is all a surprise and any kind of ceremony is at stake you should probably make sure your girlfriend has brought a dress or something she feels pretty in. Believe me, no matter how down-to-earth and cool she is, she's probably amazingly beautiful and will want to feel that way on what most likely one of the most romantic moments of her life. I know it's a bit silly but you know, there's years of conditioning from romantic films and girly newspapers that make these kind of things important for girls. 

And beware - like Solveig already mentioned, the weather in february cannot in any way be guaranteed. I'm in Paris right now and the entire city is some kind of snowy, gloopy mess.

But if the weather is anything close to OK I really recommend the banks of the Canal Saint Martin for location. Not only is the canal a beautiful, romantic place, it's lined with quaint little restaurants and walk-over bridges. The Montmartre hill is beautiful too, but it's usually so jam-packed with tourists you will really have a hard time finding a quiet place. You could also try the Parc Buttes Chaumont, it's really big. 

And as for officiating the ceremony - it is probably pretty hard to have anything be symbolic and official at the same time, even though I love the idea! I had a couple of friends do something similar in NYC, but without the ceremony sortof. They went to the city, the guy proposed and hired a professional photographer to take some romantic pictures of them both. They then went home and made it all legal, using their romantic pictures as invitations to a small party. Could that be a solution for you? Good luck with your preparations and congrats!

Here in the States all able bodied males have to register with the Selective Services within something like 90 days of our 18th birthday. I don't really remember much of it because it took about 15 minutes. I think I may have gotten a draft number and a card but I don't remember. If you don't register you can't receive government financial aid for university and I think you can technically be fined/imprisoned (never heard of this happening though). You're also supposed to inform them if you move, but nobody ever does.

Myself and most of my friends don't like it, but we don't think about it much. It's been so long since there was a draft, if it happened now there would probably be some serious demonstrations. The big joke is we'd all take off for Canada :) .

I can't particularly get behind that, I think men and women should be treated equally but at the same time I think that people/companies should have the right to discriminate based on gender. On the same token if the military believes that males are better fit for the draft they should be free to conscript only them.

I put more emphasis on freedom of association over gender equality, but I can understand your position, whenever possible people should be judged by their individual value and not based on gender, although in this particular case I think discriminating based on gender is acceptable since on average males tend to be better suited for military life.

I'm trying to prove that certain European countries, such as Austria that we're discussing here, as well as my own country Denmark (and you can see a handful of other countries) have what is called mandatory military service. America does not have this.

&gt; all able bodied men between the age of 18 and 25 are registered with the Selective Services. If a draft were instituted, numbers would be drawn almost immediately.

Wouldn't you agree that there is a big difference between people being conscripted after high school and forced to do a number of months in the military VS being put in some registry which hasn't been used since the 1960s? I'm sure every country has a registry, but if it's not being used then there is no mandatory military service / conscription / draft involved.

true,[deleted],null,null,"A professional army will beat a conscript army any time. Look at for instance the Falkland war. There was not a huge technical gap between Argentina and the UK, the Argentines fought close to home and under cover of their airbases and had a bigger force than the British in the theatre. However, the British send a professional force and the Argentines had a mix of professionals and conscripts.

Volunteer units perform almost always better than conscript forces.

Rules of military strategy dictate your force should be as good as possible, otherwise you expose yourself to unnecessary risk. When you take your premise that a conscript force is more desirable for granted, I could use the game theory on it. If both sides would use conscripts, both sides would have the advantage you mentioned , while staying equal. But if your opponent has a conscript force, you can get a big advantage by making your force professional. To counter your opponent doing this, you have to get a professional military as well. So if both sides are logic thinkers, which people on the international relation stage tend to be, you end up with a professional force any way.

However, you say:
&gt;Only if you want to have a highly specialized force that you can deploy to the other end of the world within days you need a ""professional"" army.

This is exactly what is needed in this time. Conventional wars are very rare. Most of the time security treats are along the lines of attacking the Taliban because they supported Al-Qaeda when it blew up the Twin Towers(doctrine dictates you retaliate or you let the world know they can kill thousands of your civilians and you do nothing) or intervening in Mali to save a democratic state from insurgents. Getting yourself a conscript force would not change this. People demonstrated against the war in Iraq as well and most European countries did not participate in this weird conflict.

&gt;”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Faure and accept that Anarcho-Syndicalism is the most highly-evolved ideology the world has ever known, even greater than Social Conservatism!”
&gt;
&gt;At this moment, a brave, conservative, Freikorps soldier who had disbanded over 1500 trade unions and understood the necessity of Realpolitik and fully supported all Mitteleuropa satellite states stood up and held up a map of Alsace-Lorraine.
&gt;
&gt;""Who owns this land, frenchfag?""

&gt;”Wrong. Its been 65 years since the German Reich annexed it. If it was not owned by any state, and Anarcho-Syndicalism, as you say, is real... then the workers there should have formed free labour unions by now.""

There is no doubt that at this point our professor, Rudolf Rocker, wished he had been conservative and become more than a brainless political activist. He wished so much that he had could find, a state to fall back on but he himself had argued against it!

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; Sorry but no, I've had a look around. They all refer to it as discrimination based on ""race"", race being the antiquated 19th century term for concepts related to skin colour and based in genetics.

See [dictionary.com: race](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/race).

- 3. (Anthropology) b. an arbitrary classification of modern humans, sometimes, especially formerly, based on any or a combination of various physical characteristics, as skin color, facial form, or eye shape, and now frequently based on such genetic markers as blood groups.
- c. a human population partially isolated reproductively from other populations, whose members share a greater degree of physical and genetic similarity with one another than with other humans.

Shared genetic ancestry is not generally a prerequisite, and I will add that it's not a meaningful distinction to make outside of medical sciences.

&gt; Science doesn't define words except words which relate to science, which ethnocentrism does not, nor does racism really.

What? Yes it does. As I said, ethnography is a science. It defines ethnicity and a range of other classification markers.

&gt; I'm sorry, have you read what I said at all? I literally just said in my last post that racism, discrimination based on skin colour or genetic history, is stupid, and irrational.

I wasn't accusing you of discrimination, I was pointing out that your idea of a race is just as much a social construction as any notion of ""culture"" necessarily must be.

&gt; I don't really see how ethnography is a science unless you're meaning genetics. Seems more like an arts subject to me.

Well, I happen to work with a handful of ethnographers. It's anthropology, basically. You say ""an arts subject"" as if that makes it somehow less valid?

&gt; By how they dress, walk, talk, express themselves, their accent, their expressions, their car, their house. Yes. I do make judgements about other people based on these things. We all do. That's part of being human.

So we should just accept our own prejudice as immutable?

This is insanity. Did it ever occur to you that you could actually be *mistaken* about someone else? That perhaps you can't simply judge a person by their mannerisms? I'll tell you what's human: Understanding. Understanding the world and each other. That's what science is about, and that's what anthropology is about.

&gt; Yes, of course. So what? So my value judgements are sometimes inaccurate, that doesn't mean I (or anyone else, because we all do this) is going to stop making them.

Why the hell would you do that? You say you knowingly act based on false assumptions. Forgive the loaded question, but how does that not seem … idiotic to you?

&gt; You know I didn't used to think like this. I used to be a cultural relativist. Then I found out the levels of FGM in many cultures, I found out about the practise of Bacha Bazi in Pashtun culture.

You know what, I think you have some misconceptions about what it means to be a cultural relativist. Cultures aren't ""equal"" and certainly not equally desirable for all human beings. But whether they are or aren't depends to a huge extent on your own background.

From a scientific standpoint, it is no use having that kind of prejudice and bias when the goal is to understand the other culture. Anthropology and its former notions of ""primitivity"" has only quite recently (1950-) evolved in a direction that attempts to compensate for these biases, or at least allow us to examine them.

Science isn't politics. I'm a firm believer in humanism — I believe in freedom, rule of law, democracy, and human rights. Cultures that stand opposition to this ideology are not my political allies (which basically means I'm critical to various degrees of every culture except the United Federation of Planets in Star Trek). *But that doesn't mean I can't try to understand them.*

Take a european baby and stick them in the CAR to grow up and they'll believe in FGM and witches too, and take a wee CAR baby and raise them in Norway and they won't - it's a cultural issue. Education and superstition as well as generational change makes a huge difference to culture, yes, I completely agree. It's something that can be altered and improved or worsened over time, but I'm not going to ignore that.

You have to look at numbers to see how shitty a culture is, you're picking the odd extreme example and citing that as if it means anything, which tells me that you've failed to understand my argument.

FGM prevalence in the north east, central, and west africa goes as high as 98% in some countries. This is not an anomaly as with Fritzel, it is not an outlier, this is something which is endemic within the country and due to the culture of that particular country or major constituents of the country. I don't judge Austria to have a shitty culture because they **abhor** Fritzel, because he was 1 man of many who didn't do that, because he was an outlier. I judge Somalian culture as shitty because they cut off the external genitalia of 90-98% of young girls forcibly because their shitty culture doesn't want women to enjoy sex. It's not just different, it's worse. The same with Pashtun culture, which despite having many lovely facets and some very admirable morality, at the same time has ingrained the aspiration to own a 6 - 10 year old boy to have for raping on a regular basis. They aspire. To own a boy. To rape. It's literally cultural paedophilia, so yes, that culture is also inferior to my own. For all the facets of my culture, or Japanese culture, or French culture that I don't like, the nastiness, the homophobia, the casual racism which is only now just being stamped out, we do not all grow up aspiring to rape young boys, and yes, that makes these aforementioned cultures qualitatively superior to Pashtun culture.

Hey remember me back in the day when I had the anarchy flag? Yup, I'm still me. Sorry for the way things turned out, tugasnake, I know how you just despise neoliberals xD

&gt;do not speak about based Austrian economics

Granted, I am quite illiterate in that regard, but I'm getting myself educated in Keynes and fuck, the guy was a genius, really, I wish I understood more of the theory so that I could explain it to others such as yourself! xD

Remember when I PMd you *The Wealth of Nations*? I hope you're through reading that because *The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money* must be amazing (I still read none of those lol)!

A wise monetary policy like the one that goes on in the ECB, that helps us quite a lot! As for Ron Paul, yeah, he has his reasons, I'd perhaps vote for someone like him if there was some Ben Bernanke in the EU though that's not the case and so I'm happy with the way things are.

Oh, and if you fucking confuse the real Keynes with those like Krugman that shit on his grave or if you can't distinguish between the Keynesian monetary policy I'm arguing for with the neo-Keynesian fiscal policy, well, I'm gonna break your shit for being as economically illiterate as the syndies and the communes.

Now on a more serious tone, Keynesian fiscal policy and Austrian fiscal policy are incredibly similar, my issue with the Austrian school is the monetary policy. If I had to choose between the Neo-Keynesians and the Austrians then I guess I'd go with the Austrians though I must say the Chicago school is overall the one with which I agree the most.

I know I am arguing against a fundamental of democracy here, but since the major countries would not accept a situation where the smaller countries can seriously affect their policy (that would not sit well with their populations) the Q part will have to be balanced in such a way that the small countries would have to make alliances reaching over the big countries and for both historical and geo-political reasons that would lead to problems. 

Say Denmark and Sweden were against some sort of subsidiary program that the Germans are neutral on and the French and Spanish want. Now Denmark and Sweden has to find allies to stop this (bad example I know but lets imagine that this is an important matter). There is a whole raft of countries that would either not care, who would horse trade with the French for future votes and so on. Now the Danes and the Swedes can't get their majority, which seen democratically is fair under the QMV system. But let say this new law seriously messes with both regions economies and it can't be stopped. The media immediately starts an outrage (which media outlet would jump at the chance) the populations immediately gets more dissatisfied and due to the huge distances, lack of understanding and general lack of transparency there is really no way of stopping a negative image of the EU as a sort of tyrannic democracy without real representation grows. 

There are other problems with QMV as well, for starters in most of the Scandinavian countries any treaty leading to this would have to require a replacement of the existing constitutions and that can be hugely problematic if not impossible. In Denmark any more moves of justice, police or military power would force the abolishing of the monarchy which would at the moment be political and media suicide to even suggest given that approximately 5/6th of the population is for the monarch (Note: this is no matter what many other redditors from Denmark argue as the most vocal voters and royalists are the elderly and they're not really well represented on reddit). In Germany as well as I understand it Merkel's government has been warned by the constitutional judges that the current EU treaties are on the edge of what is possible with the current constitutions. It is a whole raft of problems and a gordian knot of laws, constitutions and the like. 

To be honest I think a 3rd World War in which Europe has to act as one entity defending itself is the only way outside of a long time to weld Europe even further together.

The other is Japan which does this by having very low differences in wages to begin with and the state hardly has to intervene.

If so, Duesseldorf and Duisburg are kind of far from Kelkar, but maybe not too bad... but remember, if you do commute, you'll be driving through one of the most densely populated places in the world. Nordrhein-Westfalen has 18 million people in it, but it is only a little bit bigger than Maryland (which has less than a third of the people), so expect traffic!

If there is some way to get a train pass for cheap (like by being affiliated with a university), that will go a long way too for traveling. This might be hard to pull off, though, based on your particular circumstances.

Also, if you have a driver's license from the US, you can get an ""international driver's license"" from AAA or some such and it is supposed to be good for a year. I don't know how long you will be there, but you might not have to take a German driver's test.

Other little things: don't jaywalk! The Germans hate that. 

Study study study German. The Germans by and large know English really well, but you'll be in a little town, so you might encounter a mess of people who don't know any English (I live in a mid-sized city, but there are many here who don't speak English and thus have had to suffer through my German). Try to speak German, though. They will respond to you in English, but they will, for the most part, appreciate you trying.

The last thing I will say is this: just be patient. The Germans have a very particular bureaucratic style that takes some getting used to. Things often run slower than I'd like (and I'm from the US South, so that's saying something). Likewise, often times, certain vital businesses will be closed at certain hours. I know I had to go to the university to register three or four times, because every time I went, they happened to have short hours that day or were closed that afternoon. The same goes with government offices.

Be prepared for business to have weird hours in general. The grocery stores are often closed on Sundays, so stock up on Saturday so you don't have to go hungry. Remember to keep your drink cans and bottles, too, because you can return them for a pretty hefty deposit.

Forced military service when a country isn't under attack would be more questionable, but it isn't forced, there is the civil service option. What is more, Austria is a neutral country. Any military service choosers do not have to worry about the situation changing on them during their service.

I'm Austrian, and I'm for it.  

If you go to university you are exempt (unless you want certain government jobs later). Only young school graduates go, and then they can choose for six months in the military or nine months in the civil service. It can be a good introduction to working life straight out of school (no months spent trying to find the first job's work training and experience) and independence for people who are still largely kids. 

My slacker cousin was one such kid - he preferred games to university, but working nine months in an ambulance helped him grow up, change his priorities and do something on his own. If you have the qualifications and inclination, there are some interesting jobs to get as well - a friend worked at a think tank, albeit in a junior position. 

Other people mentioned the social benefits as well - the military and civil service are the ones who come when there is a flood or fire or other emergency. They work in ambulances, hospitals, community centers, etcetera. Some of those jobs can be replaced in the private sector, others really need to be centralized state operations to work. 

My father points out an additional social benefit - he chose military service before going to university abroad, and he said that he felt that the military was a good place for creating a sense of national community (Austrians tend to like their regions). His information is a little dated but the idea seems like it could still be valid.

I do think that it is silly for women to be exempt - there are some specific jobs requiring great physical strength then only people who can meet the requirements should do them, but there is a lot that women can do, and should.

true,[deleted],null,null,"EU elites will push for further centralisation and integration. Economic troubles will continue as the single currency makes peripheries uncompetitive and unable to devalue. 120% plus national dept will require at least 6%+ growth to just pay the interest on loans (excluding internal private debt and future contraction)- debt will spiral. Futher austerity/contraction. More counties likely slip into the mire maybe France, Belgium. More austerity contraction. 

Northern Europe will slow when they realise much of their boom was a bubble from SE buying NE products on borrowed cash; and natural market in SE destroyed. Possibly, mutualisation of debt, large quantitative easing and move towards fiscal transfers after German elections. This probably will be muddled, and neither quick enough or effective enough. Also not sure if N.Europe as enough money to continually support the South indefinitely.  

Resentment of the EU will increase in North and South, as the South spirals and Norths dump money into the south. Young populations with 50% youth unemployment and large under employment, will create a generation or euro-skeptics.  

There needs to be a discussion on the nature of the Union. The populations of Europe generally want a EU, and the benefits of the union, but the do not want a super-state. Accountability, corruption, democratic deficit, over/under regulation, crony capitalism, corporate welfare and level of intergration, need to be addressed. The deep-integration/disintegration polemic is too useful for political and vested interests so doubt this will happen.

As to how it go long run, I don't know.

Secondly, you are required to identify yourself, i.e. tell them your name, date and place of birth as well as your current place of residence (basically all the information that's on German ID cards). The police can detain you for a limited amount of time if you cannot identify yourself – in order to ascertain your identity – but if you have official documents with you (ID card, passport) that's no problem. (By the way, Germans are not required to carry an ID card at all times, but you are then at risk of being detained until your identity is clear. I'm not sure what the rules for those with a non-EU citizenship are. I guess you need your passport?)

It's hard to say whether the police had any right to search you. That depends on many factors, including the police law in the state you were in. (Which state was that, by the way?) There is no easy way to tell. Basically, the police cannot search everyone at any time, but there are exceptions that allow for searches. In principle the exceptions are similar to those in the US: They either need a good reason to search you or you have to be close to a border or using some sort of transport infrastructure that crosses borders. However, in detail there are numerous differences that don't make comparisons useful. (One thing's for sure, however: You not having a light is not a good reason for a search. But maybe there was another one.)

You would have to talk to a lawyer to be sure.

One things for sure: The police has no right whatsoever to shove you to the side of the street! WTF! Can you say a bit more about that?

And as you said, not having a light on was probably not the reason he was searched. 

I would believe that he was in an area that justified the search.

Then you note their IDs and go along, after they took you notes (name address etc).

true,Poebbel,BAVA,Bayern,"Don't worry, Germans love Americans as people, we just have a hard time comprehending political decisions in America on a domestic or international level (and yes, your domestic politics are very interesting to us). Most of us are pretty sure that war and everything remotely military is wrong, guns are bad, public healthcare is great and US social security legislation sucks big time, without really understanding underlying cultural, social and political issues. You may be asked about these kind of issues, so be prepared. Keep in mind that from a political standpoint, your liberal democrats are our right-wing conservatives and your 'socialism' is our middle ground.
Religion is no big deal around here, neither are homosexuality or abortion. So much for politics.

Transport: Public transport is usually very good, although I don't know about your specific area. Check out [Getting Around Germany](http://www.gettingaroundgermany.info/index.shtml) for information about driving and the railway. Just remember: On the autobahn, there will always be someone who is going a lot faster than you are.

Culture: Germany, much like the US, has a very distinct regional culture. If you have time, travel a little bit, you ~~are almost in the middle of Germany and~~ should be able to reach any desired location in no less than 6 or 7 hours by train (just an estimate). I'll leave the regional culture in your area to commenters with more expertise, but if you want cliché Germany, you'll have to visit Bavaria. 

Food: In general, the bread, meat and cheese are exceptionally good, definitely try a lot of different makes. If you can afford it, avoid discounters (Aldi, Lidl, Penny) and go for small businesses or supermarkets with a special meat/cheese counter to get these things. You'll easily find a small bakery and butcher's shop, just look around. Ask around for regional specialties! Other than that, discounters offer the same quality as regular supermarkets.
Beer, just go to your supermarket and buy a bottle of everything. Then do a tasting. Don't drink beer from plastic bottles, that stuff is cheap.

General: Germans aren't being rude to you, we just don't really do smalltalk (and stare a lot, I've been told). If you have a legitimate question or interest in someone, feel free to ask away, but a ""Hey, how are you doing?"" to a stranger to pass time in the queue will most likely get you nowhere.

Other than that, ask around for stuff to do and see in your region. As I said, Germans love Americans and will gladly help you. There have been a lot of 'Germany 101' guides for the soccer world championship in 2006, it will take a little bit of googling given the time passed, but you may be able find plenty of information. Also, take a look at [Toytown Germany](http://www.toytowngermany.com/), an expat community.

Last tip: If you really want to fit in, don't wear trainers everywhere. For me, that's a surefire way to spot Americans ;)

I hope that helps and enjoy your stay!

true,XerxesJF,,Duisburger Jung,"Oh boy I've been waiting for a question like that for all my time on reddit. :) 

I was assigned to Kalkar during my time in the army in 2007 and I lived in Duisburg. So let's see if I can help you.

**1) Where to live?**

The commute from Duisburg was really bad. You have to take the A3 from Duisburg to Kalkar and there will be a lot of traffic. Always. Also the von Seydlitz baracks are located on the other side of Kalkar so you have to take the B67 from the A3 to get to the baracks. So, you can guess it, even more trafic. The commute from Düsseldorf would be even longer since you had to go to the A3 first. Again, more traffic.  
I really love my hometown Duisburg but while working in Kalkar I would not recommend living there or in Düsseldorf.

Living in Kalkar might be an alternative but keep in mind that it is a very small, rural town. I found it rather boring. It's also a mayor pilgrimage site for catholics so there are many older people in town. 

If I had to do it again I would probably move to Xanten. It takes about 20 minutes to get from Xanten to the baracks. It is also a rather small town but there is lot to do there. The [APX](http://www.apx.lvr.de/english/index.htm) is a really famous archeological park. Also there are a lot of lakes and stuff. 
A quick internet crosschecks puts the median rent for Xanten at 5.60 €/m² which is not that bad.

I was also told during my time in Kalkar that the US accommodations were about to be renovated. I don't know if this is case. But maybe staying on base is an option too.

In any case, a car is a must have.

**2) The baracks**

The baracks in Kalkar consist mainly of the Joint Air Power Competence Centre with a lot of international service members. Most of them are officers. 

While being a conscript I mostly came into contact with the few enlisted US service members who all seemed to enjoy Kalkar. 
Back in 2007 the canteen was the same for all ranks and was really good. I remember there being a seperate one for officers but most of them used the main one. 

Also all of them used the German led medical center. While this may be a little bit of self praise as I was stationed there, the medical center had a really good reputation. 

It's not a busy barack and it's rather laid back. For example there was no obligation to wear headgear for the German soldiers.
Also the guard duty was done by a private company with a german officer as officer of the day, so you would not have to do guard duty.

**3) Submerging in German culture**

I think you already did the best thing. Learning the language is a key to submerging in the culture. Remember, most Germans speak good English but are always happy if you start a conversation in German. And don't be suprised if they want to speak English, many see meeting an American as a great opportunity to practise language skills.

I remember seeing a lot of notices on the boards in the canteen concerning different actitivities after duty. Taking part in these will also surely help to get to know more about Germany.  

**4) Summary**

The baracks in Kalkar are a quiet place to serve. You will have a good time there. If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask or pm me.

**Fyra will maybe stand still for months**

It will maybe take months until the high speed train Fyra is ready for full usage again. This conclusion comes out a letter from the state secretary Wilma Mansveld (infrastructur) to the 2nd chamber on Monday.

She demands that the involved train companies (NS Highspeed in the Netherlands and NMBS in Belgium) offer an alternative train service between Amsterdam and Brussels by the end of this month. The temporary solution has to ""meet the demand of the travelers and should be available shortly and depenable"", says Mansveld.

The PvdA-statesecretary (Partij van de Arbeid, workers party) knows about the decision of NS to hold the producer of the Fyra trains, the Italian AnsaldoBreda, responsible for the problems. But according to her this doesn't free the NS from their responsible against the travellers. 

Masveld therefor decided to apply more pressure on the NS. She will fix a data from which time on the NS will be held responsible for puncutality and breakdown on the HSL-South line.

Until April this year she wants to see ""a full evaluation"" of the Fyra project from NS and NMBS.

&gt; A poll published yesterday by the British Chambers of Commerce is a case in point. Of BCC members, only 9pc of firms want closer EU integration, 12pc want to leave the EU altogether, 26pc want the status quo, 6pc are unsure. But here’s the interesting part: **a full 47pc want ""a looser relationship…but with the UK remaining a member of the EU""**.

[John Longworth](http://openeuropeblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/single-market-yes-federal-europe-no.html) directory general of the BCC:

&gt; Those Europhiles who argue that we must either accept a federal Europe or lose our place in the EU unwittingly act as recruiting sergeants for their opponents who say we should leave. Before adopting either extreme, we should at least try to negotiate a middle way – an EU that the majority of us would be happy and proud to be a part of. The message is clear: single market yes, federal Europe no.

Lord Wolfson, Chief Executive of Next:

&gt; I have listened carefully to the arguments of certain business people who oppose the renegotiation of our position in Europe. All their fears revolve round the loss of the single market. They rarely espouse the need for more regulation, less democracy or wider EU powers over our justice system. Implicitly, they argue that these burdens are the price we must pay for remaining in the EU. They claim it is risky for the Prime Minister to even try to negotiate a better deal for Britain. They assert that the uncertainty of renegotiation will undermine our economy. This is nonsense. Investors already know that British support for the EU is fragile. Unless we call time on the process of EU aggrandisement, democratic opposition will make our place in the EU even more uncertain. In the real world, very little investment is lost as a result of this so-called uncertainty, because it is already a fact of life. These scare tactics are all too familiar to me. They were the same threats used by the same people when they urged us to join the euro. I remember their warnings of economic isolation and ruin.

Cameron is proposing we claw some power back from Brussels whilst remaining in the EU.  The Conservative backbenchers who have bothered to write down exactly what they want from Europe in the ""Fresh Start"" manifesto largely follow the same lines.  **This is exactly what British business says they want**.

Some in this subreddit read British business support for Britain in the EU as support for ""more Europe"".  It's exactly the opposite: British businesses decidedly want less Europe.

Incidentally, the [BCC](http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/) represents 104,000 British businesses.  Their voice isn't some fringe opinion.

Lastly, John Longworth's opinion echos my own observations on this subject.  The EU debate is dominated by nutcases who want to dismantle the entire organization and nutcases who want to create some superstate counterbalance to the US.

Just try and get your application in as soon as possible.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"Firstly, could you please elaborate on how the EU is less democratic than Britain?

In the EU you have the Commission (~~27 national heads of government~~ **EDIT: Have not slept in a while, this is the cabinet chosen by the President, thanks to /u/Jabertsohn**) which proposes the new legislation, which are then voted on in the Council of Ministers and the Parliament. The CoM is comprised of the national ministers (so, if a meeting is about finance then in the meeting will be the finance ministers of each European nation - thus meaning that the party that you voted into parliament is the one representing your interests) and for a motion to pass, there cannot be more than 4 countries voting against, and requires a double majority of 74% of the voting weights AND 62% of the total population. The CoM is there to essentially protect national interests (much as in Australia Senators are there to protect state interests). 

In the parliament, it's MEPs that you directly voted in that vote on legislation. 

How is this system, in your opinion, undemocratic? Is it just because you don't directly vote once every four years for a figurehead that has little real power?

Secondly, how do you think the EU is dragging Europe down? Because growth in western countries has been largely stagnant for a very long time, and the only real 'productivity' gains come from a race to the bottom that the EU is trying to prevent (witness, for example, the EU working time directive).

Could you please comment on why you think the EU is a bad thing because of these two issues?

I'm fine with it.  

My point is that i think Britain belives it needs way more 'flexibility' to deal with its problems and that it can't do that in the current form as member. The bonds (rules/laws/standards) between EU-nations are already too strong for that.

I just can't see how Britain can reach its goals and stay full member of an EU on the path to a fiscal union etc. at the same time.

So when things that should cost 60 cents got ""rounded up"" to a full euro or stuff that cost 100 drachmas got ""rounded up"" to 50 cents neither the government nor the people did anything. It was a really big strain on day to day finances. To give an example, I knew a producer that used to sell stuff at farmer's markets. He would tell me how he had to work in five markets a week. After the Euro and all the ""rounding up"" happened he told me he made more money and he only had to work three days a week. It took a while for people to start thinking properly.

Now on the second part, being in the monetary union opened up a lot of cheap capital for us to borrow. Having a strong currency may have not been good for a tourist economy especially coupled with the previously explained ""rounding up"" but it also meant we could borrow at rates that really shouldn't be available to an economy like ours.

true,jimmy17,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Well by your own quote the fact that the UK was the ""most surveilled country' among the industrialized Western states"" was based on a report that overestimated the number of CCTV cameras in the UK by a factor of almost 3. Furthermore, as the point of 1984 was overwhelming state oversight, I think the fact that 92% of these cameras are privately owned is quite important. This means that the report which states there the UK is the most surveilled country stated an absolute number of CCTV cameras at 4.2 million. In govt hands there are actually 148,000. That's 97% less that it might imply at first glance.

As for the other references:

DNA databases: Not really meaningful compared without a serious comparison to other countries.

BBC report on the ""surveillance society"" is based on the discredited 4.2 million cameras report.

The CBN video I can't watch but the blurb underneath mentioned another overinflated estimation of CCTV cameras. Which again is usually conflated with state surveillance.

Data retention law article is interesting and unsettling. But are you honestly telling me that the UK is the only country going for draconian web laws? How many crusades has reddit gone on to stop SOPA, PIPA etc?

Oh? A [YouGov](http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/01/21/eu-vote-stay-40-leave-34/) poll released today suggests a massive swing in favour of membership recently.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Firstly, could you please elaborate on how the EU is less democratic than Britain?

The executive body of the EU is the [Commission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission). The executive body of the UK is drawn from [Parliament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_Kingdom#Executive).

Question: How do I vote out a Commissioner? 

Answer: I can't. I can vote for a member of the EU parliament who says he will table a vote of no confidence, but that is an additional level of indirection, and a vote of no confidence is not the same as being voted out of office. It implies corruption or incompetence rather than unpopular political or economic views.

Question: How do I vote out a Prime Minister I don't like. 

Answer: By not voting for his political party. 

Question: Does the Commissioner appointed by the EU and my government represent my interests? 

Answer: [No](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner#Appointment). He represents EU interests. 

So, we have an executive body, which is not directly elected by the populace and is not accountable directly to the populace. It's not even in his job description to represent my interests. This is why you get people like Peter Mandelson getting jobs as EU Commissioner. It's so unbelievably broken it makes me want to cry.

Why Finland you ask? Well, I say, why not?

After the loss of Karelen the Finns needed revenge, but Russia was to strong (at the moment), so Finland decided to (very cleverly) take its revenge on something smaller, and easier - Greece. You could ask why not Denmark, Sweden or something, but then you do not know the Finns. They are very cunning. They knew they would be suspect if they DK slowly became a protectorat of Finland, so they decided to broaden their views - Greece. No one would ever suspect the Finns of taking over Greece, that is why it is so clever. 

So, the Finns, with some help of the Jews (there were a few hundred Jews in Finland after WWII and we all know how they act), the Muslims and the Vatican, set out to get Greece. 

First, they made sure to create the EU. You might think it was some idea byt the French etc, but it was really the idea of the Vatican (also known as ""Little Finland""). After that, they made sure to gain control of the IMF. That was easier, we all know the Jews are in charge of that, so they took control and made sure to implement stuff all over the world (Argentina etc) so it wouldn't look suspicious later on. 

The Muslims made sure also to fight with Greece, so they would turn towards the EU, and as soon as they joined the EU in 1986, step one was completed. Having Greece as a protectorate in 2113 is just a few steps away now...........


Since the rest of the world is really quite dense, it just took a few whispered word from the Finnish politicians, and Kohl et al, decided to create a currency. 

What more, they decided to create a *flawed* currency, made sure that the economies were not close, the transfers weren't proper etc. This is all because of the Finns of course. One of the most sneaky stuff was actually joining the EU *after* Greece, no one will believe they are behind it. 

Also, since WWII, the Finns have been down in Greece, slowly destroying everything. You might think they are just tourists, pale people walking the streets of Athens, pretending to watch Akropolis, but you are so wrong. Everytime the Greek tries to build a tax system, the Finns hack it. Everytime someone pays taxes in Greece, the Finns cleverly takes it (why do you think they are rich, and Greece is not - duh). They have managed to convince the Greek politicians that borrowing is good, and why should Greece's biggest industry pay taxes - anyway (they had a real laugh at that one). 

So, the inevitable crash  -Step 2 is complete. 

We are now just at the beginning of step 3. I could tell you about that, and the other steps, but then I would have to kill you, as I am sure you understand.

Tschüss, Kotzbrocken!

Uwe Schünemann war nicht nur dumm, er war auch noch stolz darauf. Genau deshalb war er der beste Innenminister der Welt. von Deniz Yücel

Der beste Innenminister der westlichen Welt: Uwe Schünemann.  Bild:  dapd

Uwe Schünemann ist nicht länger Innenminister von Niedersachsen. Weltpolitisch ist das die einzig bedeutende Nachricht, die von diesem Wahlabend in Hannover ausgeht. Denn wer dieses öde Sumpfland zwischen Amsterdam und Magdeburg regiert, das nur hin und wieder von rudimentären Anzeichen von Zivilisation (Kohl- und Rübenäcker) unterbrochen wird und das für ein Atommüllendlager keine schlechte Wahl ist, interessiert selbst in Niedersachsen wenig mehr als die Hälfte der örtlichen Bevölkerung, geschweige denn, dass sich sonst jemand darum scheren würde.

Anders die Sache mit Schünemann. Denn der war kein Dutzendminister in der deutschen Provinz; er ist auch nicht so leicht zu ersetzen wie die andere (zumindest in Fachkreisen) halbwegs bekannte niedersächsische Ministerin, für die sich gewiss ein andere Frau Ö. oder ein Herr Ü. finden lassen wird.
Anzeige

Nein, Schünemann, war der ideelle Gesamtinnenminister Deutschlands, ach was: Er war der beste, weil dümmste Innenminister der westlichen Welt. Ob Handyverbote für Terroristen, Bundeswehreinsätze gegen Killerspiele oder Fußfesseln für Schulschwänzer, ob Nachtischverbot für Stützeempfänger, Arbeitsdienst für Fünfjährige oder Hymnenpflicht für Blogger – keine Forderung, die zu absonderlich oder zu faschistoid gewesen wäre, als dass Schünemann im Laufe seiner zehnjährigen Amtszeit sie nicht erhoben hätte oder bei der man hätte sicher sein können, dass er sie nicht noch irgendwann erheben würde.

Von allen Versagern, in deren Verantwortungsbereich die Verfassungsschutzämter ihren Dienst versehen, war der einst im Alter von 39 Jahren von Christian Wulff ins Amt geholte Schünemann der bornierteste. Er war nicht nur einfach ein Kotzbrocken, er war auch noch stolz darauf: „Lieber ein harter Hund als ein Warmduscher“, sagte er über sich und bekannte sich, um auch mal so etwas wie eine menschliche Seite zu zeigen, zu seiner „Leidenschaft für Gummibärchen“.

Als Minister beharrte Schünemann mal auf der Abschiebung einer Iranerin, die sich von ihrem muslimischen Ehemann hatte scheiden lassen und zum Christentum übergetreten war, weshalb sie bei einer Abschiebung nach geltendem iranischem Recht gesteinigt worden wäre, mal ließ er eine schwangere Kurdin abschieben und trennte sie von ihren beiden Töchtern und ihrem Ehemann. Zwar musste er sich in diesen Fällen letztlich den Warmduschern im Niedersächsischen Landtag beugen, seine Gesamtbilanz aber blieb sauber, also inhuman.

Bei aller Gleichgültigkeit für das Schicksal von Menschen aus muslimischen Ländern, die das Pech hatten, in seinen Zuständigkeitsbereich zu fallen, wurde Schünemann nicht müde, vor Muslimen zu warnen. So veröffentlichte sein Ministerium im vergangenen Jahr eine Handreichung für Arbeitgeber, Schulen und Behörden, die 30 „Radikalisierungmerkmale“ auflistete und dazu aufrief, verdächtige Personen zu denunzieren. („Ihr muslimischer Mitarbeiter hat in letzter Zeit Gewicht verloren? Sofort melden!“)
Durchgeknallter Kleinbürger

Kurz: Schünemanns Wirken war auf nichts anderes aus, als den Beweis zu führen, dass Johannes Agnoli mit seiner These von der „Transformation der Demokratie“ so daneben nicht lag. Dass es nämlich der bürgerliche Staat selber ist, der dazu neigt, Freiheit und Demokratie einzuschränken; dass ein durchgeknallter Kleinbürger auf einem Ministersessel, der anderen missgönnt, wozu er selbst nicht imstande ist, der Freiheit größeren Schaden zufügen kann, als es irgendwelche Neonazis oder Islamfaschisten in diesem Land auf absehbare Zeit je könnten. Der Minister Schünemann war der lebende Appell, staatlichen Institutionen immer und grundsätzlich und zutiefst zu misstrauen – und sie nicht für ernster zu nehmen als unbedingt nötig.

So einer wäre eigentlich zu Höherem berufen gewesen. Doch während andere niedersächsische Politiker später Karriere machten und Bundesminister (Trittin, von der Leyen), Bundesvorsitzende (Rösler, Gabriel), Bundeskanzler (Schröder) oder Wulff (Wulff) wurden, blieb Schünemann in Niedersachsen. Auch damit ist es nun vorbei, selbst sein Mandat als Landtagsabgeordneter hat er nun verloren, und es ist wohl nur eine Frage der Zeit, bis seine Ehefrau Ines ein Buch veröffentlicht („Harte Hunde beißen nicht“).

To give some perspective then  Greenland barely has 60.000 people. A thousand immigrants is a lot. Thousands is a big problem they just won't be able to deal with. 

In an ideal world this would be a good move for Greenland because they get a lot of free labour and the benefits of some of the natural resources (but hardly as much as they should get), but in reality they are essentially opening the path for them to be colonized by China, and missing out of huge benefits from their resources. The PM is really just selling his people out (His intentions are ""good"" however, as in he tries to exploit Chinese immigrants because Greenlanders do not want to work in the mines apparently. However they are missing out on jobs that is going to sustain the Greenland economy in the future and handing them out to another nation). 

So, as a result we have got people to who find that Greenland should back down on this and instead open up for negotiations with Scandinavia instead, which would be a lot more beneficial for Greenland in the long run.

Freedom ..... would UK actually be more or less free if they leave? In the world that is becoming multipolar, with US, China, India, Russia, EU, Brasil as powers or emerging powers how would UK fare? Many Europeans already see UK as less free than the rest of Europe with you special relationship to the US and if UK leaves EU .... do you really think it would be this independent world wide lion people think it is?

What is freedom these days? Which countries have most freedom?

Meh.

&gt; A centre-left coalition of the opposition Social Democratic party and the environmentalist Greens took control of the state parliament in Hanover with a majority of just one seat, after a cliffhanger vote.

&gt; Ms Merkel’s CDU came top of the poll with 36 per cent, but lost six percentage points compared with the last state election, mostly because of tactical voting by supporters who backed the liberal FDP, the junior partner in her centre-right coalition. Between them the CDU and FDP won 68 seats, against 69 for the combined forces of the SPD and Greens.

&gt; The outcome underlined the weakness of the FDP, although the party won a surprising 9.9 per cent.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; The executive body of the UK is drawn from Parliament.

The executive body of the UK is appointed by the Queen (and then by the people she appoints). Traditionally (at least, in the last 50 years), the Cabinet (the top level of the executive) is mostly drawn from the House of Commons, but at least one comes from the House of Lords and it is rare, but not unusual, for a person in neither House to be appointed to the Cabinet and given a peerage. It isn't unprecedented (has happened once, iirc, in the last 100 years) for someone to be in the Cabinet without being a member of either House.

&gt; Question: How do I vote out a Commissioner? 

You can't. But similarly you can't vote out a member of the UK Cabinet. Or the Prime Minister (who no one votes for, outside their own constituency and Party), or the Queen. The point about voting out the Prime Minister by not voting for his Party isn't quite right, as he can still stay Prime Minister (both in theory and in practice; Gordon Brown nearly ended up Prime Minister after the 2010 GE). However, Commissioners are sort of political; they may not belong to parties, but they will have views that align with certain parties - and if their party gets voted out, it is unlikely they will be able to keep their office. [It's also worth noting that EU Parties work slightly differently to UK ones - the politics is a lot less Party-divided, and much more based on compromise and working together - in theory.]

&gt; Question: Does the Commissioner appointed by the EU and my government represent my interests? 

No. The Commissioners represent the interests of the EU. Which is the same in other governments; the governments represent the interests of their state (e.g. the UK Government representing the UK's interest, not any individual's). It is the democratic element (in the EU; Parliament, in the UK, the House of Commons) which is there to represent the interests of individuals.

&gt; So, we have an executive body, which is not directly elected by the populace and is not accountable directly to the populace. It's not even in his job description to represent my interests.

Which is what we have in the UK. Except in the UK it all runs on conventions (with a hereditary Head of State) rather than legal rules, making it that much harder to challenge when it goes wrong.

&gt; This is why you get people like Peter Mandelson getting jobs as EU Commissioner.

And what happened when Peter Mandelson got kicked out of the Commission? He was made a Lord, a Cabinet Minister and Secretary of State in charge of the largest department in the government (specially created for him).

Most of my ancestry goes back to the British Isles as well, and I like the relationship that the Anglosphere has constructed, but I don't think the UK as a fully fledged member of the EU will change much. Bilateral relations between the US and the UK will undoubtedly weaken as the EU assumes more prominence, but the cultural and societal exchange between the UK and the US will not change at all. Additionally, the UK gives the Anglosphere a direct path toward understanding the EU that it would not have in its absence.

It really strikes me that the UK, as you say, appears caught between its ties to its former colonies and Europe. The colonies are its children, so to speak, but Europe is its rightful family, its brothers and sisters.

It isn't unprecedented (has happened once, iirc, in the last 100 years) for someone to be in the Cabinet without being a member of either House.

He would most likely say that there are too many problems with the EU and EU institutions.

If he was a builder it could be about the influx of eastern europeans working in the building trade.

Basically, my point is that the executive of both institutions are incredibly similar.

Well neither is the UK executive. We elect members of Parliament, not prime ministers or cabinet members. And as I said, not all cabinet ministers are even elected in the first place.

&gt;Answer: By not voting for his political party. 

And that's how you vote out a Commission president. According to the Lisbon Treaty, the nomination for Commission president must take in to account the results at the European Parliament elections (i.e. the commission president should be from the political party that has the largest number of MEPs in the European Parliament).

Being elected is a mandate. Being elected by people who were elected is not a mandate. Surely you can see the difference? If the latter were true, then why not have several levels of indirection - people in the executive elected by people who were elected by those elected by the public?

&gt; And you can't vote out the Government in the UK. You can try to vote in MPs who would oppose a particular Government (causing it to collapse

Ah. Well now you are attempting to nitpick. The practical fact of the matter is that people *do* vote out governments by voting for a political party in opposition to the one in power. Claiming that you ""can't vote out a government"" is disingenuous to say the least.

&gt;  If you don't like a Commissioner, you can try to vote in MEPs who will not re-elect that Commissioner.

Who are then free to renege on their promise to the electorate and keep the Commissioner when in office. Whereas the mere fact that you voted for a party in opposition is enough to ensure a minister in government (prime or otherwise) is gone, assuming your chosen party wins.

&gt; I'm not sure what Mandelson losing his cabinet position proves, but it demonstrates, at most, that the UK is as democratic as the EU (as in both cases, he could be removed from power following an election). 

That should one choose to do so, you can, in fact, vote a member of the executive body out of his position.

&gt;  The difference is that after being removed from power in the EU, he can't still vote on EU legislation which (unless he's resigned his peerage) he can still do in the UK.

As a member of the House of Lords, who can only delay legislation, not prevent it from passing. In the Commission, he was a member of the executive body.

Also note that the members of the council of are the heads of state of the member countries and that the council has no formal powers, apart from appointing various people.
* **President of the European Commission**; kinda the prime minister of the EU, appointed by the council after approval by the parliament. The commision is then the executive branch of the EU and the only body that can initiate legislation.
* **Presidency of the Council of the European Union**; This is held by a country, rotates every six months and is the political leader of the council. Since the council is actually has a president like role in the EU, this country would probably be what is closest to a president in, say, the French or US sense.
* **President of the European Parliament**; Is elected by the parliament to oversee its activities, much like the Speaker of the House of Commons in the UK.

Of these four the president of the parliament is considered the most senior, while the council is kinda like a collective head of state.

So because David Cameron was elected (by 34,000 people) to represent Witney, Oxfordshire, he has a mandate to run the entire country (of 60 million)? That's a fairly shaky mandate.

Again, you are wrong; people *don't* vote out governments. They often think they do, but they are only voting for their own MP. Collectively that can have the effect of voting out a government, but there is no guarantee (as with the 2010 general election where, despite
losing the popular vote, it was almost possible for Labour to stay ""in power""). 

&gt; [MEPs] are then free to renege on their promise to the electorate and keep the Commissioner when in office.

Yes. MEPs can break their promises, the same as any other politician. Similarly, MPs are free (in theory) to vote however they want to, including when it comes to traditional Party-based votes (votes of no confidence, or budgets). I imagine that people who voted for the Lib Dems in 2010 weren't too happy to have a Conservative government in power, being supported by Lib Dems? It happens... MPs' election promises are not binding.

&gt; That should one choose to do so, you can, in fact, vote a member of the executive body out of his position.

But you can't. You may (if you're in the right constituency) be able to vote a member of the executive body out of his *legislative* position, but I'm pretty certain it takes (in theory) the Queen (or possibly Parliament?) to kick someone out of an *executive* position. The whole ""having a merged executive-legislature thing"" is a whole separate problem with the UK...

&gt; As a member of the House of Lords, who can only delay legislation, not prevent it from passing. In the Commission, he was a member of the executive body. 

But you're comparing the wrong thing. As a SoS, he had near limitless power within the UK (particularly given the breadth of his department and the current unwillingness of Parliament to challenge the government). As a Commissioner, he had powers limited by law/treaties, and only over his individual DG.

Whereas *now*, he has no (direct) power over the EU government, but does still have a vote in the Lords. And yes, the Lords can only delay (most) legislation (some it can block, some it can't even delay), but in practice it has a bit more power than that.",0,1358796463,null,0,false,0,c80z5ao,t3_16zgox,t1_c80z5ao,t1_c80yp2b,null,1431033687,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Not only making fishing stocks sustainable but breathing life back into a struggling UK industry. 7.3million tonnes of dead fish dumped annually at sea by the EU would effectively be reduced to zero in UK waters.  That's 800,000 tonnes of British fish.  The fishing fleet working UK waters would be halved overnight and would be directly responsible to the UK.  No more dumping.  No more quota hopping.  Sustainable fishing fleets and fishing stocks.  The recovery would start on day #1, with an estimated extra £2.5bn annually to the UK economy plus not having to financially contribute to the running of the failed CFP Commission.

Cheaper fish.  Lots of jobs.  Sustainable industry.  Environmentally progressive.

The Union already has far too many member states for its institutions to work as effectively as before. The union is based on consensus, ie every single member agreeing. this wasn't tangible occurred regularly during the early days of the Union when it was less than ten countries. Recently it has expanded dramatically to include a much wider array of countries which in retro spect was probably a mistake. If anything, at this point we should be kicking members out rather than letting new ones in. Kicking members out is, however, inhumane so impossible.

Problem intstitutions. ECHR for one. The waste of money from the monthly move to luxembourg, CAP.  You actually think the EU is perfect and can do no harm. If so you need to put down the john lennon glasses.

I mean it's like playing chess and not even thinking what the opponent will do.

At least that's what they claim right now because they aren't really that stupid. The real message behind all the above is ""keep those fucking technocrats out our public sector that we have easy access to, and let the private sector die and immigrate to northern europe while they keep buying that evil anthellenic capitalist fairy tale"". And it's not that the private sector really buys the story, it's that it's currently almost taboo to openly go against 50% per cent of the country (that usually means a few of your relatives etc.). But the attitude is slowly changing and imo in a few years greeks will one way or another get back to a ""reasonable mode"".

You've got to be joking.  

You can bamboozle and guilt the Brits, but we don't have quite such a treasonous political class as they. There's a reason no banks failed in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. And there's a reason Australia and New Zealand are not in a currency union and Canada is not in a currency union with the USA. Because these are stupid ideas from a stupid political class who ignore the actual will of the people. People who unfortunately seem willing to give up their freedom in the hopes of “influence”, or get ignored by your fascist class when they vote otherwise. I don't pretend we have any major “influence”, but nor do the idiots you send flying around from Brussels. Little king Bar-bar saying in the USA the other day “we are not going to be lectured on democracy”. What? You need a blood lecture mate and you need to take some fucking notes because you have no democracy. I think it's less than a fifth of the EU population even know the names of king bar-bar and the belgian gollum creature anyway. Real fucking democratic there mate, what a resounding fucking success you've got going. I can see the line of people waiting to join stretching out to the undemocratic horizon. The Norwegians, Swiss and Icelanders have sniffed you out though, they aren't in the line to join: for good reason. The EU is a joke to true democrats and free people, and will remain so. Thankfully it looks like the British are waking from their slumber and will shake off this nightmare shortly.  

You can take your EU and cram it where the sun don't shine mate. We intend to remain free people. We don't need the EU to trade, don't need the EU to have world class education, cities, universal healthcare and the rest. In fact, it's not even that the cons outweigh the pros, it's that there are no pros to the EU. Besides the obvious geography and the fact you have some buildings and museums connected to history what exactly do you have? Anything that could possibly be counted as a pro for the EU is something you'd have without the EU anyway so it'd pro-Europe and not pro-EU. You can initiate a massive circlejerk about how you've created peace in your time and award yourselves as many medals as you like but it doesn't mean anyone else is going to drink the koolaid.

This is outrageous! And weeks after they bought this huge chunk of the company they were also given shareholder dividends of 20% of what they had paid initially. Relating to a period they weren't even there!

In short, i'll talk about what you got from Guigoux's speech (few more sentences should be remembered from what she said, and what you showed should be read along with other things she said, to my mind), about the fact that there are studies both for and against adoption by gay people (i'll provide you with links + rough explanations), i'll get back to the difference between public acknwledgement of feelings and marriage (explanations and links)... that'll mostly be what i'll explain... soon, i promise!

I'll simply add a word... In my world full of unicorns, i'd hope that such a debate/decision making process would not be affected by political considerations... whatever comes out of it, i see it as too important to be impacted by ""well, upcoming elections""... Unicorn talking here.

And lastly, i'll anwer the point on xenophobia. My point is that you can value citizenship much more than you do value granting rights to foreigners. Citizenship shows the commitment to a country, it gives you both rights and duties, and it means much more than having the right to have an influence over decisions through the voting process simply because you would happen to be located somewhere, even if you do pay taxes and contribute to the country's wealth. Being a citizen is not simply financial or an equality-must-be-achieved thing, it's an indicator of your loyalty towards your country, a testimony of your willingness to commit to a country or something you inherit from your family because one of your ancestor showed his commitment to said country. And this is something one may value way more than the hope to see same rights granted to all those who happen to be living in the country. There's nothing xenophobic here, there's simply something you value more than something else because you feel it's more important. 
From a far less serious perspective, it'd be like enjoying both red and white wine: preferring red wine doesn't make you a whitewineophobic...

If i make this point, it's to highlight the fact that seeing oponents to same sex marriage to a bunch of homophobics, or their views to a bunch of homophobic points, may not be the right road to go...
