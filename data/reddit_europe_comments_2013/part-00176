true,trolls_brigade,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Is you opinion that the Swiss model is a good template for a future government? 

The Swiss model is deeply rooted in their history and their cherished neutrality. Even more, the Swiss model is supported by a strong industrial, financial, services and tourism base. In other words, they found a groove that worked and helped them become rich and preserve their wealth.

It won't work in other countries, with a very different geopolitical background.

&gt;Your examples in this thread completely focus on the negatives of this style and completely ignores the much more serious negatives of other styles. 

The negatives are so annoying, that I wouldn't want to see them repeated anywhere else.

&gt;And will no executive or a shared executive cabinet be able to effectively curtail lobbying? Will lobbying not exist just because the targets shift to members of parliament with even fewer regulators watching?

Lobbying should be completely banned. Lobbying is just a way to legalize corruption and traffic of influence.

&gt;How would the EU handle pork projects without influential politicians from smaller regions? Will all military, space exploration, and government facilities be simply built in regions with the highest populations or will they simply make after the election coalitions and still distribute pork in an even more convoluted system? 

Good question. Right now, there are many EU projects in poorer states. There is a very strict audit though. If you fail the audit, you lose the funds or you have to reimburse the EU. Romania is one of the countries which is very weak when it comes to absorb EU funds, I think they are at about 10% absorption rate. The rest of 90% of the funds are never disbursed by EU.

&gt;Your arguments are very untested and weak.

My arguments revolve around what EU shouldn't do, rather than offering green-field solutions. What solution will work is a matter of debate between the EU people.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;The american system does not work

Hm? Looks like it's been doing pretty good over the past ~200 years. It's hardly even had any constitutional amendments either. It's also got one of the highest GDP per capitas of any country on the planet and also the largest economy in the world excluding the EU common market. It's definitely one of the better countries in the world to live in terms of democracy. I mean, just compare it to any non-Western country and even a good number of Western countries.

&gt;europe should be able to set guidlines and standards member states should fill in on their own.

So we should remove the Common Currency, the EU cohesion funds, the European Space Agency (Second best funded space agency on the planet), Eurostat and any possibility of a united military force which is actually capable of protecting us from any future threat without relying on the US. Also the EU financed transport initiatives along with a whole host of other stuff. 

Further more, why do you expect member states to fill in the guidelines set out by the EU? I mean, EU member states already do this a lot. Whenever the EU passes legislation all that does is force the appropriate member states to implement that legislation in their national parliaments. How they implement it is up to them. If they don't comply then they get a fine until they do comply.

Take into account this as well. The EU is built on the principle that the EU should only take on competencies for things which are best served at the federal level or are incapable of being served at the national or local level. The European Union is built on the stance that the smallest unit possible should do as much work as it can and every level above that should only do what the level below it is incapable of doing effectively. Your local council is incapable of running an army or a currency. Portugal is incapable of bargaining effectively with big countries like China, Russia and the USA to get good trade deals, so that competency is devolved to the EU level. Again, most countries are reluctant or incapable of funding an effective Space Agency by themselves which is why the ESA is here (European Space Agency).

So the EU sounds like it largely complies with your wishes. How would you prefer it to be laid out? ",0,1377355155,null,0,false,0,cbuez9l,t3_1kzvlv,t1_cbuez9l,t1_cbudju7,null,1429715582,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

In the US the ""American style"" is mostly understood as Executive-Judicial-Legislative.

The only real debate here is whether the executive should be separate from legislative or not. I suspect that in a country the size of EU-27, we'd almost certainly find ourselves wanting to elect the executive. Why? Because the ""coalition of right wing parties"" deciding the prime minister would feel WAY too distant to everyone. Oh, they selected some Austrian dude to be the prime minister I've never heard of. Yay? This would undermine faith in the system very, very quickly.

For a federal system I think the US one works very sensibly.

However, the devil is in the details. Senators **must not** be directly elected. I would also keep the executive branch the fuck away from the judicial branch, and possibly bring in the heads of states (ie US governors) in on those discussions while keeping the president in the dark.

Also the elections must NOT be First Past the Post, as that is probably the greatest reason for the rubbish seen in the US (along with gerrymandering, which is why I think the EU would have to let open source computer algorithms decide the electoral boundaries). Single Transferable Vote maybe?

So the overall US structure seems fine.

Sì, se riesci a tener fuori le manacce di certa gente, senza dubbio.

Guarda, probabilmente mi sono spiegata male nel primo commento. **Io non ho nulla contro la canapa in sé**; se ne può fare un buon uso ed un cattivo uso (dove per cattivo uso intendo qualcuno *sempre* fatto) così come per l'alcol. Se si potesse legalizzarla favorendo, appunto, la coltivazione privata e facendo nascere tante piccole realtà locali, ne sarei davvero contenta. Il problema è che, complice magari il luogo da dove vengo ed il fatto che ne ho visto se non di tutti i colori, di abbastanza colori per quanto riguarda collusioni/corruzioni/concussioni, non ritengo che ci siano i presupposti per la legalizzazione. La questione è politica per me, non sociale o morale. (Non la butto in politica perché ho pietà di te ad ogni modo :D)

E così come esite un buono ed un cattivo uso, esite una buona o cattiva legalizzazione; visto che ritengo che non si riuscirà a farla ""buona"" e che non sono tipa da dire ""meglio cattiva che nulla"", non supporto la legalizzazione.

Per lui basta uscire dall'euro, anzi l'euro è già finito, perché nel 1992 ci fu la svalutazione della lira e l'economia migliorò. Quindi siccome la storia si ripete sempre in modo identico dobbiamo fare lo stesso. E' matematico. Chi mette in discussione ciò non ha capito niente.
Non importa che allora il costo del petrolio fosse ai minimi. La FIAT non era quella di adesso. Non c'era il WTO. Non c'era la Cina. Non c'era la direttiva bolkstein. Non c'erano decine di altri paesi che ora sono cresciuti e ti fanno un mazzo così. Non c'era proprio la delocalizzazione. 

No, ci basta uscire dall'euro e le aziende correranno da noi per aprire la sede. Le nostre aziende venderanno in tutto il mondo, cosa non si sa, forse delle sedie fatte in Serbia. Non importa se la tassazione sarà altissima, la burocrazia inefficiente, la logistica un incubo, la mafia chiederà il pizzo, il sistema giudiziario farà acqua da tutte le parti, i sindacati ti ostacoleranno in tutto, il governo cadrà ogni 12 mesi e mentre sarà in carica discuterà di intercettazioni, puttane minorenni, amnistie, evasione fiscale, IMU e delle banane lanciate qua e là.

There exists no free healthcare anywhere. Someone is paying for it. None is refused urgent medical care in the US.

&gt; A country where an education costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ?

More bullshit. yes if you want to blow hundreds you could go to the most expensive out of state school with room and bard + party for years, but that is most certainly the exception. Also look at tuition across Europe. They are also headed vastly upwards. On top of that, why wouldn't the person seeking advanced education not pay? Why should Joe laborer help pay so you can have a cushy paper pushing job?

3 - 6 % is now exorbitant? Wow Here is an idea, if you don't like the terms don't borrow the money.

&gt; A country where the government spends billions on weapons that the military doesn't even want

And the only reason most of Europe can get away with NOT spending tons in this area is because we provide protection. Its also a massive jobs / export item so while I would agree we need to cut back its not that simple.

Yes this is true: in theory the UK can fine-tune their banking system better. However, practically speaking there is only so much you can do with this control. Moreover the effects of central banking policy on the economy at large are badly understood (as much else in macro economics), or at least not well-enough to fine-tune anything.

&gt;And the only reason most of Europe can get away with NOT spending tons in this area is because we provide 
&gt;protection. Its also a massive jobs / export item so while I would agree we need to cut back its not that simple.
Arrogant American jingoism.

A country where a parent has to worry daily if their child will be slaughtered by a crazed killer who brings an arsenal of weapons to do the job ?
&gt;What? Again this is very rare and also happens in EZ countries.
Lies.

A country where teachers are being armed ?

Yeah right. And dozens more are in mid training.

Why can't she just take off her veil? To me the comfort of a single person does not justify discomforting half the courtroom.

&gt; Also, in the same sentence you proclaim that long-standing cultural practices are irrelevant, but then immediately try to support your argument by quoting a long-standing Western cultural norm. 

No, I just say that if you want to use the ""cultural standard"" argument, that argument works both ways... so it's not possible to use that in favor of either side.

Why victimize the audience by forcing them to run back and forth to serve a rule of religion they don't even subscribe to?

true,ultra_violence,NEWZ,New Zealand,"&gt; Why can't she just take off her veil? 

It may seem extreme, but a Muslim woman being forced to reveal her face to the public would be similar to a Western woman being forced to reveal her naked chest to the public. Of course there is nothing offensive about a woman's face or a woman's breasts, but the cultural practices of hiding the face/breasts mean that actually revealing them can mean the loss of dignity, and a sense of embarrassment and shame under the scrutiny of strangers. 

Don't forget that the ONLY man who sees her face is her husband and close family. It may seem bizarre to you, and difficult to understand, but ultimately the woman being forced to reveal her face will cause her dignity to be lost. However having a veiled woman stand in the dock will NOT cause any loss of dignity to the curious onlookers, court officials, or the judge.

&gt;Just because there is an association between being uncovered and indecency doesn't mean that uncovering your face in court is indecent.

I never said it DID mean that. But certainly to the woman in question, it WOULD feel indecent and wrong. Hence her loss of dignity. She may be wrong to feel like that, but is it really her fault after likely being indoctrinated from birth by a misogynistic sexist religion?

&gt;victimize the audience

I really can't believe you said that. Are you insane? How in the name of gods green earth is the AUDIENCE BEING VICTIMISED by witnessing a veiled woman?

&gt;The crux of the issue is between two views on laws and justice

I think you can't see the forest for the trees. You're assuming that by allowing the woman to keep her face veiled, somehow the course of justice has been in some way perverted. Nobody is arguing that the woman receive different treatment to any other person. The law will still practiced, and if she is found guilty, the sentence will be the same whether she is wearing the veil or not wearing the veil. The Judge ALREADY exercises a huge amount of discretion. I really really do not think the fundamental tenets of Western Justice are threatened by a woman standing in the dock wearing a veil.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt; However, I do not think capitalism is the ideal of a society,

Point one.  Neither do capitalists and most villagers don't think in ideals or absolutes as it's not practical and rarely do they integrate into other people's idea of ideals.  It's about mutual choice,

&gt;Capitalism is a coercive system. One must near always be part of the system in order to survive in it.  

Wrong.  There is absolutely nothing stopping people from setting up communes or cooperatives.  A hundred years ago, you might have had an argument.  

You are not coerced into anything.  Rather the welfare system which is paid for in no small part by the horrible upper classes and those jumping into capitalist venture actually provides that anybody wanting to make life choices are more empowered than ever.

&gt;It is a biased system that serves one class minority from the labour of others.

Nope.  It's just a division of labour with work and reward attributed to skills, risk and effort.  It's why we get self-employed plumbers and electricians, and plumbers and electricians that are employed.  Some people want to put up the collateral or the fruit of their labour, put in their time, to make the investment, take on the risk and the liability, whilst some people would rather take the salary and greater job security.

&gt;Those in the West live the best standard of life on Earth because their nations are the economic brutes of the world. Today, the dollar and the euro are the new tools of economic imperialism, rather than the rifle and the sabre.

Not capitalism;  Canada, Norway and New Zealand, for example.

&gt;Why is this person unemployed? Did he not work hard enough? He did his job every day, he was on time. Why did this happen to him? Because there was a way of circumnavigating the higher cost of having him as an employee. 

Not necessarily in a capitalist based economy - but he can always get another job in an evolving economy, or as quality drops off there will be a drive for innovation.  Innovation is what breaks down the classes as it creates a middle class - not that this whole class system means much in this century. 

&gt;The Belgians in Congo, The French in North Africa, the British in India. Same plot, different story.

Oh I know.  Same could be said for the Russians and Chinese.

What you're actually talking about isn't actually capitalism but human nature.


&gt;If they are living a comfortable existence, then they are fine, and will put up with things like falling wages, rising debts, unemployment and layoffs, and a wealth-gap.

Unless you're an innovator, a changer, a do-er, a go-getter, in which case a capitalist system allows one to go out and address those things without micromanagement.  Jobs, believe it or not, don't exist until a person makes or identifies one.  Zimbabwe found that out.  They handed land and resources out to the people and the farms stopped producing.  The land owners who had been moved off the land were quick to point out that farms don't just happen because someone has access to the land.  It takes someone to make it happen.

&gt;You don't bring up the way that welfare was almost always won and fought for; leftists getting the shit beaten out of them and jeopardizing their lives to get a shorter working day, a higher wage, and basic safety/workplace rights. 

But not communism and still in a capitalist society.  So the point of welfare remains.  When you only talk of one class propping up another the system is far more dynamic and mutually reciprocal than that.  It's moved on.

&gt;People starved themselves, people were killed by the military and police, as well as thugs administered by respective companies.   

Are we in Gotham, the 19th century, or even remotely near to  approaching the latter half of the 20th century?  

&gt;The welfare that we enjoy and take for granted today wasn't given to us because the benevolent invisible hand of the free market was looking out for the interests of the working class that day; it is because workers fought and died for their right to them.

You take for granted, not just for the workers, and the workers are more than free to go work for themselves.  They're not serfs.  They're not tied in.  

&gt;Once the system's no longer sustainable, like French feudalism when it was overturned and violently replaced with the capitalist mode of production, one can see how happy the majority of the villagers are.

The system becomes less sustainable the further it moves from capitalism.  Which is why the soviet union fell and why the European commission and parliament is struggling so.  Thankfully the system adjusts over time.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; It may seem extreme, but a Muslim woman being forced to reveal her face to the public would be similar to a Western woman being forced to reveal her naked chest to the public. Of course there is nothing offensive about a woman's face or a woman's breasts, but the cultural practices of hiding the face/breasts mean that actually revealing them can mean the loss of dignity, and a sense of embarrassment and shame under the scrutiny of strangers.

If the juridical procedure of the country involves baring one's chest, then that's just what you have to do.

&gt;Don't forget that the ONLY man who sees her face is her husband and close family. It may seem bizarre to you, and difficult to understand, but ultimately the woman being forced to reveal her face will cause her dignity to be lost. 

So you would be okay with honor killings, since that's also a matter of dignity? I presume you would not. Therefore dignity is not a sufficient reason to allow it in this case either.

&gt;I never said it DID mean that. But certainly to the woman in question, it WOULD feel indecent and wrong. Hence her loss of dignity. 

I might feel I lose my dignity by having to pay taxes, but that's not going to allow me to skip my contributions to the community.

&gt;She may be wrong to feel like that, but is it really her fault after likely being indoctrinated from birth by a misogynistic sexist religion?

Neither is it the fault of anyone else.

&gt;I really can't believe you said that. Are you insane? How in the name of gods green earth is the AUDIENCE BEING VICTIMISED by witnessing a veiled woman?

Well, either you would have them leave and reenter the courtroom, or they would see someone being allowed to change the details of the juridical procedure because ""it doesn't feel right"", giving them a less accurate testimony because her face and body language can't be evaluated.

&gt;I think you can't see the forest for the trees. You're assuming that by allowing the woman to keep her face veiled, somehow the course of justice has been in some way perverted.

No, by allowing people to change the procedure based on personal preferences.

&gt;Nobody is arguing that the woman receive different treatment to any other person.

Then there is no problem. Other persons aren't allowed to testify with masks either.

&gt; I really really do not think the fundamental tenets of Western Justice are threatened by a woman standing in the dock wearing a veil.

The actual thing is of minor importance here: it's a matter of principles. In this case the principle that should be upheld is equality before the law. You can't make exceptions based on personal preferences. What's next: someone refusing to answer a female judge or lawyer? Someone pleading that his culture considers female witnesses lower than male ones? Interrupting the court for prayer?

Portugal does have cutting edge research. But without an industry to support it, all innovations' commercial and financial potentials are exploited by foreign economies, not Portugal's. Without an industry, know-how is a niche, not extensive.

Portugal used to have its commonwealth, but centuries of terrible foreign policies lead to its end. Portugal is the one mostly to blame for this.

Once it's in the place we can find way to make it circulate. But our economy CANNOT survive in both autarcy and bleeding itself to death with most of the area's money getting out in fiscal evasion in bermuda triangle under-the-mattress hidden accounts.

And the best way to get a decent deal with the americans is probably to push for one from our side too, before they think better of it and try to screw us with a shitty one way ""deal"" like they're pushing in the pacific to force their economy in at all costs.

If done well, that trade agreement would mostly mean we could sell all of our surplus without too much fear to the US, and import massive amounts of extra cheaps good to maintain everyone's living standards at lowered costs; despite a rampaging economic crysis.

Imho it's less about saving gdp/growth and more to save our entire industry and market from suffocating from a lack of money in everyone's pocket in europe. Lowering barreers for goods and incoming money would allow us to reach an enormous market abroad.

Not just that for instance, for Old Cars. The government would give people £2k to take it off the road (and buy a new one of course).

&gt; You know it's not supposed to be a good thing, right?

How is that so ? I do not argue in favor of *deregulated* capitalism. Merely less regulated international trade, making things come into our world area then ensure proper redistribution in our region. We'll both get richer that way (us Europe, and the USA). But it does need to start with ""making shit come here""; aka large scale goods trade (and i'm not talking about finance bank bullshit here, but real, physical things and services like food or parts or software or books or ...). We can easily play on thing like border taxes to influence the trading balance without breaking our backs.

What the US do on their border of the world with their own wealth on the other hand is their own issue. It might create wealth distribution issue in the US but that doesn't mean it's our duty to solve it for them or even shoulder it damn it. If somebody ought to fix US long term wealth distribution issues is the US and not us. 

Our duty on the other hand, to our own citizens, is clear : help ensuring the european living standard in our corner of the world without screwing any other country needlessly. And that treaty would allow us to do so, if we manage to stay on the same footing Intra Europe (we'll need agreements between european countries i guess but that can be arranged at any time i think; it'll be way easier than the negociations with the USA).

The one part we need to be careful about it is the legal part : a tax loophole is not a law loophole. We should rejet IP/patent bs on sight.

I'm not ""ranting and raving against all Muslims""....I'm merely pointing out the linkage between Islamic theology/tradition and the actions of Muslims. How can we ever expect to facilitate reform in the Islamic world if we are in total denial about the pathologies that afflict it?

As for your absurd linkage to Hitler, his ideology was entirely antithetical to Western/Christian values. The Western/Christian world played an essential role in destroying his vile regime.

But why can there be no commensurate exposition of the historical sins of Islam? Why can't we rationally discuss the Hindu and Armenian genocides, the Muslim slave-trade, Islamic Imperialism, etc?

true,Britzer,GERM,Germany,"&gt; I'm merely pointing out the linkage between Islamic theology/tradition and the actions of Muslims.

No. You try and interpret Islam the way some extremist nutcase would do. That is is all violence and fascism. Just like anyone could interpret Christianity. I just tried to point out the errors in it. Is it in the scriptures? Christians also have crazy scriptures. Is it in the culture? Our Christian or even enlightened culture brought forth Hitler. Is it today? There is Kony. Trying to pin the problem of terrorism on all Muslims is racist. And wrong. Just like trying to pin Brevik to all Europeans. There is no ""secret linkage"". This is conspiracy crap. There is no 9-11 conspiracy either for that matter. 

&gt; As for your absurd linkage to Hitler, his ideology was entirely antithetical to Western/Christian values. The Western/Christian world played an essential role in destroying his vile regime.

Your average European Muslim would say the same about Osama.

&gt; In our political and academic discourse in the West, we are constantly exposing and revisiting our own historical sins....Imperialism, colonialism, the Native American genocide, the Atlantic slave-trade, etc.....and RIGHTLY SO. These historical sins SHOULD be exposed, discussed, deconstructed.

&gt; But why can there be no commensurate exposition of the historical sins of Islam? Why can't we rationally discuss the Hindu and Armenian genocides, the Muslim slave-trade, Islamic Imperialism, etc? Why is THIS PARTICULAR historical investigation off-limits? Why is it ""HATE"" to engage in critical scrutiny of Islamic theology/culture? 

Nothing is off limits. If it stays in history. But this is not a discussion of history, but of today.

You were the one that started the discussion with some racist shit. All Western women would need or want to wear scarfs in all Muslim countries. And my favourite so far:

&gt; Why can't THEY take the same accommodating attitude about OUR culture?

This sentence is very racist in almost every context. For example: Why can't black people behave themselves in our country? We behave in their country. Muslims **are** part of Europe. They **are** part of **us**. **Our** culture. 

Besides, as I already pointed out. Extreme religious views were driven out of most Muslim countries in the 50s and 60s by Nationalistic views in the aftermath of the decolonization struggle and is now making a resurgance. Why? I dunno. But I partly blame oil money. Saudi Arabia, for example, is a close ally of Western countries that spends a lot of money spreading **very** extreme religious stuff. They do this under our protection. We shielded them from Nationalistic Saddam Hussein in 1990, when Saddam took over Kuweit and threatened the Saudi kingdom. Most Muslim terrorists hit Muslims themselves (upwards of 90% casulties are Muslims or something like that?). And they are ideologically motivated by our allies in Arabia. Probabely also financed by them. 

So these terrorists that you try to pin on Muslism? Our guys actually. Killing mostly Muslims. And you are trying to blame them for that. And because of these reasons, most of the more educated Muslims actually have a lot of righteous hate for the West.

The US has about 1200, which is fewer refugees per capita than the UK, France, or Germany, but comparable to Spain or Italy.

I believe the standard in question, without checking properly, has a lot of French influence. The major powers probably got what they wanted.

Why arbitrarily confine sociological analysis to history? Why not discuss sociological problems that exist today....even if they reflect poorly on a community? For example, should we NOT look at the racism that exists in Western society today? You are ALL FOR THAT! So, why not look at the sociological problems that exist in the Muslim community? 

No! According to you, this is apparently off limits. We MUST NOT investigate the source of honor killing in the Muslim community....that would be racist! We MUST NOT investigate the source of female genital mutilation in the Muslim community....that would be racist! We MUST NOT investigate the religiously-motivated violence that is so endemic to the Muslim community....that would be racist!

What in the world does this have to do with ""black people""? We are talking about a religion/culture. I would suspect that most sub-Saharan, African immigrants to Europe make wonderful contributions to European culture.

&gt;Muslims are part of Europe. They are part of us. Our culture.

I see it differently. Many are. But many aren't. Many Muslims are uninterested in assimilating into European culture. Are the episodic Muslim riots and car-burnings in France part of ""European culture""? Are the Muslim honor killings on the Continent part of ""European culture""? Is polygamy and child-marriage - undeniable aspects of Islamic theology/culture - part of ""European culture""? Is the female genital mutilation increasingly seen on the Continent part of ""European culture""? Do you WANT these pathologies to be part of European culture?

Maybe someday you'll be able to shed your left-wing blinders and begin to look at the issue with greater clarity and maturity.

I've met plenty of free-market advocates that *do* claim it to be an ideal. Mutual choice in a free market is sided to those with more capital by nature. They are the ones in ultimate control.


&gt;Wrong. There is absolutely nothing stopping people from setting up communes or cooperatives. A hundred years ago, you might have had an argument.

&gt;You are not coerced into anything. Rather the welfare system which is paid for in no small part by the horrible upper classes and those jumping into capitalist venture actually provides that anybody wanting to make life choices are more empowered than ever.

Communes and cooperatives today must still operate in the capitalist system. They must still buy supplies from capitalist producers, they must rent and or buy land. They must adhere to a set of laws made for a capitalist economy. They may be a little better than the average corporation in terms of how work is done and how the structure of employees is, but it is ultimately useless in a capitalist economy to try for a cooperative and think it would lead to any change.

They are some rights that have been one since the labour movement in the west in order to have a progressive taxation rate put on them. I wouldn't make it out to be some grandiose gesture of generosity to the working class. Look at companies in America today for instance. They will purposefully keep hours of employees low so that they cannot collect any sort of benefits, and make most workers part-time. And pay them far below what a living wage average is, and have the government programs that exist cover the rest, costing millions upon millions a year.

&gt;Nope. It's just a division of labour with work and reward attributed to skills, risk and effort. It's why we get self-employed plumbers and electricians, and plumbers and electricians that are employed. Some people want to put up the collateral or the fruit of their labour, put in their time, to make the investment, take on the risk and the liability, whilst some people would rather take the salary and greater job security.

Capital is the lubricant to make the machine move. Most people that work have little to no capital so they must sell their own capacity to work in order to continue their existence and acquire *some* capital to use for basic commodities of life. Most people are not self employed, and never will be, so it seems a bit useless to use that as the way for your argument as a means to say that not everyone must sell their own labour. Most people don't have the necessary capital to do such a thing and effectively become ""petit-bourgeois"". 

Of course everyone wants job security. People just want to live their life. But the guarantee to job security is compromised heavily in either. What if you are laid off because your factory job is moved to Indonesia? Or what if your self-owned plumbing company declares bankruptcy after a few years of declining business? Think it will be easy to obtain a loan after something like that?

&gt;Not capitalism; Canada, Norway and New Zealand, for example.


For this, I am not sure if you are pointing that none of these countries use the US dollar or the Euro, or if you are using their safety nets and social-democratic welfare as proof that they do nothing to harm the developing world. Many businesses of these nations actively engage in moving businesses to the developing world in order to escape the horrors of paying a living wage to its workers. Many of the goods in nations were made under horrid conditions by labourers of the developing world. These nations will also, through agencies such as the IMF, give high-interest loans to countries that cannot afford them, and cause debt to continue its increase.

&gt;Not necessarily in a capitalist based economy - but he can always get another job in an evolving economy, or as quality drops off there will be a drive for innovation. Innovation is what breaks down the classes as it creates a middle class - not that this whole class system means much in this century.

Unemployment is a requirement in the capitalist system. . Capitalism requires an excess supply of labour in order to bid down wage growth and other topics. It drives on the unemployed to actively search for work. Perpetuation of unemployment is a prerequisite in order to drive down labour demands. People would be more willing to take a stand against a policy of their employer if there was no danger of losing their job and source of income. Even today, in some of the most capitalist economies of the world, unemployment is skyrocketing out of control. 28% in Greece, 27% in Spain right now, with a much higher percentage for youth that are in or just leaving university.

There are reasons why unemployment is often a problem in capitalist developed nations, and why recessions, and other economic crises like them continue to foster.

Capitalism tends to greatly overproduce goods and commodities during competition with other organisations. Eventually it is no longer profitable to sell these commodities, and people are laid off to maintain profit margin.

Employment is only offered based on profitability in nearly all cases. In order to keep a steady flow of income.

Your use of innovation in relation to employment in capitalism is a misnomer, or that times of crisis in capitalism will beget innovation by law. Most innovators aren't motivated by personal reward. Mastery and purpose is what is usually the greatest motivator of most innovation.

If you want a a real world example, you can take Thomas Sankara for example, the former Marxist president of Burkina Faso.

When Sankara's government redistributed land from landlords to peasant farmers' control, the national wheat production increased from 1700 kg per hectare to 3800 kg per hectare. These policies helped make Burkina Faso food self-sufficient in just a couple of years. Sankara and 12 other officials were killed by an armed gang in a coup by another politician, Blaise Compaoré, a western-backed politician that is still the president of Burkina Faso.

&gt;Oh I know. Same could be said for the Russians and Chinese.

No argument for the most part. The tactics of Stalinism and Maoism were in many ways reprehensible paranoia and should not be forgotten.

&gt;Unless you're an innovator, a changer, a do-er, a go-getter, in which case a capitalist system allows one to go out and address those things without micromanagement. Jobs, believe it or not, don't exist until a person makes or identifies one. Zimbabwe found that out. They handed land and resources out to the people and the farms stopped producing. The land owners who had been moved off the land were quick to point out that farms don't just happen because someone has access to the land. It takes someone to make it happen.

The pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps technique. A Catch-all response to someone that is disconnected from the struggles of one in the system another is fine in. Do you think that 1/2 of the Italian youth are just being lazy leeches out of university, or that 2/3 of Greek youth are in the same boat? One needs resources to obtain innovation and be a ""go-getter"". No one ever got rich from selling their labour itself. I do agree with you on the fact that jobs don't exist until it is identified, but obviously for a different reason.

As for Zimbabwe, asserting the failures of the corrupt government and the dictator Robert Mugabe to pseudo- land reform shouldn't be done. The only group that land redistribution was made to serve was the upperclass that has led a new privileged existence under the ZANU-PF, which also has direct control of the so-called ""peasant"" reform in the country. 

In 2011, several socialists in Zimbabwe that spoke out against the failures of Mugabe's regime at land reform of the early 2000's were sentenced to prison. These members of the ISO were arrested, detained illegally, tortured, and given a show trial with the verdict of a 10 year prison sentence.

And Zimbabwe had a seemingly infinite list of problems before the botched series of land reforms initiated by Mugabe. When it was called Rhodesia, many of the same problems existed with the agricultural sector of the country.

There have been plenty of examples in history where self-organisation of the work has increased productivity and production. For example, Burkina Faso.

&gt;But not communism and still in a capitalist society. So the point of welfare remains. When you only talk of one class propping up another the system is far more dynamic and mutually reciprocal than that. It's moved on.

Yes, the point of welfare was to appease the workers that were starving themselves outside factory gates and putting up mass demonstrations, walk-outs, general strikes, etc. Welfare worked for the upper class in that it assuaged the masses and made many of them fine with the situation, compared to the way they were working before. Now many people had access to a higher wage, lower working hours, and rights to unionise. Welfare wasn't given. It was taken.

&gt;Are we in Gotham, the 19th century, or even remotely near to approaching the latter half of the 20th century?


I am not sure what exactly you mean by Gotham (?). But by 19th and latter half of 20th century do you mean to insinuate that this doesn't happen before since the fight for welfare in western nations is more or less solved? Things like this still happen in Greece and Spain in response to the failures of austerity in these nations, and the loss of essential welfare programmes.

&gt;You take for granted, not just for the workers, and the workers are 
more than free to go work for themselves. They're not serfs. They're not tied in.

I'm sure I often do take such things for granted, but I do try my best not to. When I get sick I am very glad that I live in a country with an effective universal health-care system. When I would like to go somewhere with friends when we all have the time from work to do something, I am very glad that I am guaranteed, at least at the moment, to at least 5 weeks paid vacation a year, and even more thankful that my career field gives me 8 full weeks. But these are rights that had to be one from capitalists by workers. 

No, today in the west there are no serfs. There is a working class. They have it better than serfs ever did, but they still suffer problems that is not theirs, and work for a class whose interests are opposed to their own, and most people are more or less tied into the system that is prevalent. If your options are to be a part of a system where you must sell your capacity at less than its value and give this money and work to someone else, or to not do this exchange, but be homeless, hungry, and thirsty, then it isn't much of a choice at all. It is coercion.

&gt;The system becomes less sustainable the further it moves from capitalism. Which is why the soviet union fell and why the European commission and parliament is struggling so. Thankfully the system adjusts over time. It's the communist world revolution that collapses when it meets developed capitalist systems, not the other way around.



You say it is less sustainable the further from capitalism, and yet you seem to praise social-democratic welfare in countries where public ownership is higher than most places on the planet, and more forms of social welfare are more widely available. These are opposed to capitalism ultimately and your statement seems to contradict itself openly at two opposing places.

The Soviet Union fell for a multitude of reasons, but the movement of private business beginning in the 1980s in the realm of a planned economy is without a doubt one of the most significant factors in the Soviet economic collapse. The Soviet Union's fall was due to reforms sought by men such as Gorbachev and Yeltsin, which attempted to introduce free-market capitalism to replace state-capitalism as the prevailing economic system. This was very disastrous of course. the Soviet Ruble's purchasing power dropped very badly in a short amount of time. The Ruble just a few years before was more valuable than the dollar, and it got to the point that this gap was getting wider and wider, with the ruble losing its value throughout the collapse in 1991 and the economically disastrous privatising that occurred throughout the 1990s under Yeltsin, and ultimately caused the death of 1.000.000 Russians due to the economic mismanagement of the 1990s, and according to the UN, 3.000.000 people are estimated to have died in East Europe due to the falling standards of healthcare and social programmes.

As for the situation in many EU nations and as a result of the European Commission, it is direct result of western neo-liberal capitalist policies. The EU commission is so anti-market that they are now trying to engage with the US in the largest free-trade anti-tariff agreement in human history?

I am not trying to unnecessarily agitate, so I am sorry if this is the message that I have projected unto you. I do try to see (with empathy) the position of others on issues such as these, whether it be economic, social, religious, scientific, etc. If you have any questions in relation to what I've said, you may want to try posting a thread on /r/socialism. It is one of the more accepting political subreddits and often you will see good debates and conversation arise (although the recent trend of the opposite is worrying to the life of the subreddit itself).

true,arrrg,null,null,"If you want WiFi coverage (and also the best network in general) you want Deutsche Telekom. Their contracts run for 24 months.

Their cheapest plan for smartphones that includes WiFi access will cost you €40 per month (unlimited minutes and SMS inside Germany, 750MB data per month at up to 16Mbit/s before you are throttled to unusable GPRS speeds; I think you can optionally add 500MB of unthrottled data each month for €5 if you want to). The plan is a bit cheaper if you order online (only €36 for the first 12 months of the contract).

If you are up to 29 years old you can get their (sucky) student discount, i.e. 200MB of extra data or you can fuck net neutrality together with helpful Deutsche Telekom and get the evil Spotify option for free (Spotify premium access and listening to music through Spotify doesn’t impact you data usage).

The name of the plan is Complete Comfort M (or Complete Comfort Friends M if you get the student discount). You can, of course, climb higher (to L, XL, XXL, Premium) if your budget allows it and you want more.

If you don’t insist on getting access to WiFi hotspots you might consider smaller mobile discounters, e.g. Congstar. They are a daughter company of Deutsche Telekom and consequently use the same network and in general allow for more flexibility in some respects while cutting features. For example, you do not need to have a 24 month contract with them and can – if you want to – cancel monthly. If you hardly ever make calls or write SMS you could also, for example, get a plan from them where you pay €13 for 1GB of data and 9 cent per minute/SMS. Or you get their SMS flat (€10) plus 500MB of data (€10) plus 100 minutes (€7) for €27 per month. (They also offer a phone+SMS flatrate with 500MB for €30 if you get a 24 month contract, €35 if you get a one month contract.)

The downside of this is that you get no visual voicemail, no additional SIM cards (you can get them at Telekom if you pay extra per month) and no way to increase your data volume halfway through a month. As is usual in Germany, if you go over the data you are merely throttled down and do not have to pay extra.

Incoming calls and SMS are always free in Germany.

All of this doesn’t consider how cheap or expensive making calls to the US or UK would be – and that can be very expensive. If you need that ability the aforementioned options might not be ideal for you.

This was a very superficial overview (there are many other options) – but it should give you a good idea on what you can expect when it comes to features and price.

With no trade barrieres what would stop a company to move to the US and be taxes by their rates?

&gt;both autarcy and bleeding itself to death with most of the area's money getting out in fiscal evasion in bermuda triangle under-the-mattress hidden accounts.

I would argue that autarky is better for small companies and those dealing in the commercial sector, because with less barriers foreign competition would crush local companies on price alone.

The tax loopholes would continue, but this time it will be perfectly legal and transparent, a company can simply move their headquarters to the US.

&gt;the best way to get a decent deal with the Americans is probably to push for one from our side too

Cause Americans are well known for their flexibility and amiability 

&gt;sell all of our surplus without too much fear to the US, and import massive amounts of extra cheaps good to maintain everyone's living standards at lowered costs; despite a rampaging economic crysis.

1. The US has massively more surplus than we have, 
2. Those extra cheap goods will slaughter the small companies that won't be competitive at those low prices.
3. How is consuming cheaper and worst products maintaining your living standard, is sounds to me like your lowering it with denial.
4. You haven't seen an economic crisis until you see companies with small margins eviscerate your local economy and then when the going gets tough, the can easily pack their bags and get out of your country.

&gt;t's less about saving gdp/growth and more to save our entire industry and market from suffocating from a lack of money

Oh boy. There is no easier way to kill an industry than to alow other companies to come in and disrupt the environment.

You have 2 companies, one is backed by wall mart and one is a small shop keeper, your a banker, witch one do you finance?(to make money with low risk)

&gt;Lowering barreers for goods and incoming money would allow us to reach an enormous market abroad

No, it will allow the biggest of our companies to reach a bigger market but mostly it would allow them to move their manufacturing to the US, produce subpar products (reasons in the article) and sell them with the same European price. (and no we don't get more taxes because at this scale the companies can negotiate directly with a government how much it wasn't to pay)

Debating all the fundamentas of society, thats something we certainly do in this country isn't it? No. He, along with with his (Swedish) colleauges do not see it as their mission to create debate, to discuss issues of importance. Rather they're quite happy to thread along reporting the views of their friends insinde our ""Beltway"". Hence I think he is a bad choise in promoting freedom of debate abroad.

Know what, I'd like to see him take his new found fondness of public debate home and write a piece ahead of or election. I'd like him to write a piece stating a want and need for vivid public debate regarding all fundamental aspects of society. That would never happen. Rather we have dysfuntional debates regarding  several policy areas, this due to Wolodarski and colleagues. 

Also, I think it is preposterous and quite embarrassing to go about,  as a nobody form a small nation to sign such a piece. The primary interests of a state will always triumph that of the individual in issues such as this. 

Edit: It kinda pisses me of that he would go about signing such a peice aroad while being a central actor in our own dysfuntional public debate. its nothing but a load of poustering at a safe distance from home.

Not taxing citizens doesn't cost the government anything. The government didn't have a right to the money.

Yeah, they don't do that. Welfare recipients could drink taxpayer-funded Red Bull all day long and not bankrupt the government. We're going broke for other reasons. But I admire your class-warfare rhetoric.

true,All_Hail_Pancakes,EURO,European Union,"I would be quite happy with Turkey joining the EU IF it manages to bring its internal and external affairs in line with the requirements for membership. These include freedom of press laws, separation of state and  religion, improving democratic standards, improving treatment of minorities, and reaching a lasting peaceful solution to the Cyprus dispute, among other things. If it can do that, on the balance of things, I'd say the membership will greatly benefit both the EU and Turkey.

It has a rapidly growing economy ([will be 5th largest in Europe by 2030)](http://www.pwc.com/en_GX/gx/world-2050/assets/pwc-world-in-2050-report-january-2013.pdf); has the 2nd largest military in NATO; would provide the EU with greater legitimacy when acting in the MENA region.

Moreover, it has a growing young and increasingly well-educated population, which could be increasingly needed in the EU since the population of some of the major countries is shrinking. If the EU wants to  expand its economy, it will need more skilled workforce, and I'd rather see well-integrated Turks take these jobs, than having to 'import' labour from Asia or Africa.

Obviously the main issue with the membership is the cultural gap between the EU, with largely Christian heritage, and the predominantly Muslim Turks. Having said that, in my experience with Turkish people, religion or culture has never been an issue, and they were always really kind and friendly people (might not be representative of the whole population, as it was mostly young people at Western universities).

Naturally, a whole different question is whether or not the Turks themselves want to join the  EU at all, which increasingly seems like it is no longer the case for the majority of people and politicians.",0,1377421036,null,0,false,0,cbuwhe6,t3_1l165o,t1_cbuwhe6,t3_1l165o,null,1429707321,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

First off, try to locate yourself by *arrondissement* ^(borough) instead of by street; there are hundreds and hundreds of streets and it's hard to know them all the main ones on the 20 arrondissements. That being said, look at a map- the arrondissements start on the first ^(duh) and go around on a spiral... In that same map, you're staying in the 20th arrondissement, which is a bit further east from the centre (1re). You're also located in the least convenient place of Paris as your métro stop is Pelleport, which is one of the least used stops in the whole network, making part of a ""3bis"" line that connects that area you're in with two other lines (3 and 11). Also, take in mind that area can get a bit shady and isn't the nicest place in Paris, but many other people say it's their favourite in the city (all that is 18e, 19e, 20e)...

&gt; Also our French isn't very good, will we get by alright?

The modern nation of Turkey was founded on secular principals. Turkish nationalism, while jingoistic, tends to be jingoistic-ly in favor of Attaturk, who put in motion the idea of a secular, western-facing Turkish state. 

The current government has courted the people who would prefer an Islamist state, it's true. The whole secular-or-not question has become a divisive issue. But it's worth noting that Turkey doesn't have the Islamist bent of, say, Somalia, Afghanistan, or even Egypt.

&gt; They do not want to be one of us

From what I can tell, this is the case. Even if you're not thinking in terms of what the Turkish people want, accepting a country where loads of people have problems with being an EU country could lead to problems down the road - balking at commitments, etc.

C'est plus honnête que de laisser des puceaux nous dicter comment on doit baiser nos femmes ou nos hommes, et nous dire que les femmes ne peuvent pas représenter ni le père ni le fils ni le saint esprit parce qu'elles ont pas de couilles, alors même qu'il s'évertuent à désexuer leur fonction. CA N'A PAS DE MAUDIT BON SENS et ça m'énerve, voila, on en est plus là socialement et l'Eglise n'a pas encore compris qu'il fallait que son modèle change, qu'il fallait qu'elle vende Saint Pierre et toutes les terres consacrées et qu'elle utilise l'argent des ventes pour participer à la recherche médicale et créer des missions laïques. Si l'Eglise faisait ça, elle serait au sommet de mon estime et la superstition des hommes serait un moyen de provoquer leur empathie au lieu de les enfoncer dans leurs peurs et de les frustrer.

true,Aldrikh,null,null,"Hello,

rue de la chine is very close to where I live, and it's a very nice area, although there aren't many tourist sights.

Two or three very good restaurants are in the Chine street itself (the Chalbens, at the number 33, has a lovely 3 course dinner for around 30 €, usually very fresh and original).

The parallel Rue des Pyrenees has a lot of small shops that are just excellent (especially for the bread, cheese and charcuteries, so you can easily make tasty sandwiches). It's usually pricier than a supermarket, but is totally worth it.

At the bottom of your street you have a market on Wednesdays and Saturdays (I do recommend to go there on a Saturday, the stands present are just better), and you get another market on Sundays at the other end of the street.

In terms of tourist attraction, obviously, the Père Lachaise cemetery is very close. You'll need a map (which are sold for 2 or 3 € in every shop nearby, or just download one online http://www.tourthepage.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Pere-Lachaise1.jpg) or even better, a tour (I've never tried it, but it looks like it's easy to find an english one http://www.viator.com/tours/Paris/Paris-Pere-LaChaise-Gravestone-Walking-Tour/d479-3731GRAVES), to find the celebrities you'd like to ""meet"" and really enjoy it. 

Not too far, you can stroll in the ""Campagne à Paris"" area http://goo.gl/maps/lNfXJ which are houses originally built for worker (but certainly aren't affordable by anyone anymore). It's lovely, and really unexpected in Paris (houses!). Another pretty street is this one: http://goo.gl/maps/YKKJw (Villa de l'ermitage). There are a few others that you may find by wandering.

If you want to go out, there a few concert venues that have live music almost every night. It's usually pretty cheap (around 10 €, depending on the band), most of the bands are not famous, but you can get some really nice surprises. La Maroquinerie (http://www.lamaroquinerie.fr/) is very close and La Fleche d'or (http://www.flechedor.fr/) is a bit farther and both are worth trying out (you can usually find the upcoming bands on their respective websites and listen online to listen if you'd like to hear it)

And if you want a more lively street, with bars, discos and cheap restaurants, the Rue de Menilmontant is very close.

One last advice, the metro 3 is very convenient and easy, but there are a lot of buses which are a lot more pleasant to use. The line 69 (
http://www.ratp.fr/informer/pdf/orienter/f_plan.php?fm=gif&amp;loc=bus_paris/&amp;nompdf=69) goes directly *inside* the Louvre museum for instance.

Then the old boss stepped down and his successor was a young guy, fresh from University who studied economics rather than beer brewing. The result was that the quality went down, the beer recipe was changed to taste similar to Augustiner, which is by far the most sold beer in Upper-Bavaria, and suddenly Tegernseer started to sell like ""warme Semmeln"" and the brewery almost doubled its sales within 12 months. 

As soon as a brewery goes from producing good beer to profit maximization, the quality will go down. Also if you want to sell a lot you need a beer that fits the taste of everybody.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Many. First world population is growing in an accelerated rate. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population ) To feed all those people we need to produce more crops. If we fail to do this we are looking forward to a global collapse. Secondly, the current rate of farming taxes the enviroment. We should find a way to reduce pesticide, herbicide and fertiliser use, these chemical compounds, which are leaked into the enviroment in millions of tonns are seriously fucking up Earth. Third we need to cut down carbon emissions, as we are changing the climate which will result in a catastrophic warming of the planet.


GMOs are the sole viable solution for this we currently have. As crops they are enviroment friendly, much much more than conventional pesticides. They need less farming and less chemicals which means less fossil fuels burnt just tending our crops. Crops can be engineered to resist virii, and to increase shelf-life, reducing waste, thus reducing the amount of food needed to feed humans. Every small increase in farming productivity means a little  more time for rain forests and other natural habitats, before they are destroyed. And the most important one I left last. GMOs open a wast field of new materials which are enviroment friendly, as they are produced from living organisms, not mineral oil, and are biodegradable, they will not pollute the enviroment for centuries, like common plastics do it now. For instance spider silk is much stronger than silkworm silk, it could be used instead of many currently available synthetic materials, for instance in bulletproof vests. However it can not be produced in large quantitites, as spider farming is incredibly hard, thus expensive. This is an age-old dilemma, which can be solved immediately, by producing spider silk in silkworms. ( http://www.pnas.org/content/109/3/923.short )

You'll be close to Gambetta, in fact I'll wager that's where you'll be getting the metro. It's true you're a bit out of the center of the action, but Paris is so tiny it takes no time to move back into the touristy parts of the city, PLUS you get an awesome opportunity to see a lot of the ""off the beaten path"" type stuff.

First off, in your immediate area, rue de Pyrénées and place Gambetta is a great commercial area that's filled with shops, boulangeries, bookstores, cafés -- and it manages to remain kind of quaint with small shady streets and almost no tourists. (Shady in the sense that there are a lot of trees.) 

Père Lachaise : You're not far from the Père Lachaise cemetery which is f-ing gorgeous in any season and really fun for games of hide-and-go seek and grave stone scavenger hunts.

Bars at Oberkamf : &gt;10 minutes on Velib or a 25 minute walk (or 6,40€ cab ride) down rue Ménilmontant to one of the best spots for bars in the city, Oberkampf (rue Oberkampf and rue JP Timbaud). You can't swing a stick without hitting a fun spot to hang out. My favorites are [l'UFO](https://www.facebook.com/BarUFO), [la Fine Mousse](http://www.lafinemousse.fr/) (French and International craft beers, though a quieter ambiance and bigger price tag), and [Ave Maria](http://www.timeout.com/paris/en/restaurants/ave-maria), though there's TONS of stuff around. 

Bois de Vincennes : If you get on a Velib, you're about a 15-20 minute ride downhill to the enormous and beautiful [Bois de Vincennes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bois_de_Vincennes) which is a beautiful place to spend a sunny afternoon. The bit closest to you (near Port Dorée) is more manicured, with a big lake and fields and gardens (and rentable bikes and rowboats) than other parts where you can get lost in the woods on small dirt roads. (It's also less sketchy than it's counterpart the Bois de Boulogne, on the other side of the city.) 

Parc des Buttes Chaumont : You can get the 26 bus on rue Pyrénées and take it down to the [Parc des Buttes Chaumont](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Buttes_Chaumont) (a 5-10 minute ride), a somewhat hidden gem that's 1000x more populated by locals than tourists. Because the park is so hilly and green with views of cliffs and waterfalls and babbling brooks, it's a favorite picnic spot for Parisians. You might even consider getting off the bus a stop sooner and picking up some Chinese or Vietnamese food on the rue de Belleville before heading up there.

Restaurants : I could post twice the amount of content I already have here if I start to talk about restaurants, so instead let me guide you to a really useful English website called [""Paris by Mouth""](http://parisbymouth.com/) which lists restaurants by arrondissement for your convenience (I wouldn't trust guide book restaurants, they miss the bulk of the *really* good stuff). My favs include, Verre Volé, Mon Oncle le Vigneron, and O Divin.

As far as speaking French goes, make sure you say ""bonjour""/""bonsoir"" whenever you enter a shop or restaurant or whatever, because it's minimal effort and it's polite. After that I would just practice asking people in French if they speak English : ""Excusez-moi, est-ce que vous parlez anglais ?""

So, when they negotiate something, they have to represent their constituents, leave room for compromise, and then forge alliances with other countries before entering the main negotiating rounds, all while taking their local politics at home into account.

It is a contentious area, and I'm sorry if we don't agree on this issue, but in my opinion also, the majority of the population has no clue about institutions, legal systems, economy, etc. They usually vote not for what is best for the country, but what is best for their individual short-term interest. And the politicians will follow these views because otherwise they will not be voted into power.

They do not *want* to become part of the Swedish society. 

I think that is rather horrible. It is fine accepting welfare, free health and some place to live, but when it comes to giving back, or being part of something, it is like this man explains - the Romas *chooses* to stay outside. They are just using the Swedish society, not contributing to it. Why do you defend that? 


[Here](http://www.svt.se/nyheter/sverige/unga-romer-kampar-i-motvind) is an article that only every 10th Roma graduates from school, something that around 90 % (at least) of non Roma student does. Only half of them, even finishes 9th grade, the *absolute* minimum in Sweden. There is no other group with numbers like that, none. And we are talking that people from Somalia, and Afghanistan are beating them  - because they want to go to school and get an education. The Romas chooses not to. 


[50 000 Romas lives in Sweden. Less than 10 of them studies at university](http://lundagard.se/2010/12/12/%E2%80%9Dfarre-an-tio-romer-studerar-pa-universitet%E2%80%9D/). You do not see numbers  that bad, anywhere else, really. 

Oh, and the absolute majority of the Romas have arrived in the last 40 years. You can hardly blame us Swedes for generations of discrimination. They come here, they choose not to educate, not to participate etc- and you defend that. I think that is so wrong that you do that, and that you treat them like infants. And I haven't even started with the links about crime...

Oh, and here is a link about a Roma adult school, for Romas who haven't finished school and need courses to qualify. The school has a Roma profile. [Link](http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.768476-fusk-for-hundratusentals-kronor-pa-folkhogskola).That is one of the way the, according to you, the discriminating Swedish state is trying to tackle the problem that the poor, poor Romas can't go to school.  The problem is that a lot of the students were never there, although they recived money to study, and the school received money from the state. It is called stealing. Why do you excuse that? 

I have hundreds of similar links. All of them are from ""normal"" sources btw, not right wing extremists papers or something similar. 

[Here](http://www.socionomen.nu/text/2012-romernas-ar) is an article about Romas in Sweden. All of them say that they have it far better in Sweden than anywhere else btw. But, in Malmö, not even half of the Roma children even go to school. Why do you defend that? Also, the article mentions that at least 80 % of the Romas live on welfare, and that they live unhealthy lives and uses a lot of drugs and are often in prison. 

Also, the article mentions something I find interesting, a Swedish researcher about Roma history. He mentions that attitudes like the ones you have, are racists too, if all you can see is a victim. He says that the Romas are of course responsible how they behave towards other people. It is nice to know that even researchers agrees with me (and disagrees with you).

Frankly, can't you get that we are the top welfare country in the world. No one, and I mean no one in Sweden, has to steal. No one, and I mean no one, has to starve. 

&gt;Which is not what I'm doing.

Yes you are. You have excused the fact that they are not sending their children to school for example. 

&gt;According to me? Really? Because I don't remember saying that.

&gt;Are black people responsible for the situation they currently find themselves in?

Black people in which country? In Nigeria and Somalia? Yes. In Sweden  - yes. In the UK - yes. And, are black people in the US responsible for their actions - yes. Are you honestly claiming that black people all over the world are not responsible for their actions because of their *race*? Seriouysly, you are such a racist if you claim that? Explain to me in detail, why a black mother who steals is less responsible than a white mother for her action? 

Also, remeber that 95 % of the Romas in Sweden has come in the last 40 years, so they *choose* to come here, they were hardly imported as slaves.

A couple of comments back I told you that I cannot read Swedish and asked you to provide statistics, not news articles. News agencies often distort the truth in order to suit their own needs. If your claims are true it shouldn't be too hard to find approved studies and statistics. 

&gt;I think that is rather horrible. It is fine accepting welfare, free health and some place to live, but when it comes to giving back, or being part of something, it is like this man explains - the Romas chooses to stay outside. They are just using the Swedish society, not contributing to it. Why do you defend that? 

Just like black people, right?

&gt;Here is an article that only every 10th Roma graduates from school, something that around 90 % (at least) of non Roma student does. Only half of them, even finishes 9th grade, the absolute minimum in Sweden. There is no other group with numbers like that, none. And we are talking that people from Somalia, and Afghanistan are beating them - because they want to go to school and get an education. The Romas chooses not to. 

I've already explained why that is so. Do you actually read my replies or am I wasting my time here?

&gt;Oh, and the absolute majority of the Romas have arrived in the last 40 years. You can hardly blame us Swedes for generations of discrimination. They come here, they choose not to educate, not to participate etc- and you defend that. I think that is so wrong that you do that, and that you treat them like infants. And I haven't even started with the links about crime...

Where did I not blame Sweden for anything, I pointed out that its handling the situation all wrong.

&gt;I know that the Romas have been victims of the xenophobia, but I think you are so wrong excusing every single behaviour. There is not reason for their behviour in Sweden - none. 

There was this news article I read a while back about a ""wolf boy"". He was abandoned by his parents in the woods and was raised by wolves. He was eventually found and returned to civilization but he could never adapt. He had trouble learning how to speak, how to walk upright, how to use the toilet etc. In the end he ran back to the forest.

After hundreds of years of discrimination and forced isolation I am not surprised the Roma community acts as it does. It will take years, maybe decades, and a lots of hard work to reintegrate them into society, a society, mind you, that enslaved and killed them and, for all intents and purposes, doesn't want them. Your refusal to acknowledge the similarities between the struggle of Romas and black people is proof enough that your argument stems from ignorance of the Roma's historical and modern plight.

I know that's a bit of exaggeration to say that the UK will end up in endless poverty, as it probably will not, but it will probably be worse off than if it decided to stay. 

And by voting pro-EU in the referendum, people should acknowledge that the EU has not reached it's end-state yet - the creation of a strong, peaceful, wealthy, and unified Europe. And further integration will occur in order to achieve this goal. There are no half-measures here. Being in the EU and opposing integration is missing the point of why the EU was created in the first place.

No, so is giving them food, welfare, good schols and housing all wrong? So the Romas are such delicate little flowers that exactly every single thing have to be in complete accordance with *their* wishes? Other immigrant groups adjust and contribute to society? Why can't the Romas do that? How can you excuse the fact that they don't, depsite being given fucking everything? 


&gt;Your refusal to acknowledge the similarities between the struggle of Romas and black people is proof enough that your argument stems from ignorance of the Roma's historical and modern plight. 

You refusal to give the Romas any responsibility and excuse despicable behaviour and choose to see them as helpless victims is, apart from being racists, and sure way to make sure that the Romas will continue down the path that they have started, stealing, uneducated etc. Instead of seeing them as adults that make their life choices, you treat them like poor little victims. 


Also, as I told you that no one, Romas or not, in Sweden has to steal, or is starving. Why do you excuse Romas that do that? 


&gt;Just like black people, right?

I have already answered that. Are you honestly saying that black people all over the globe are not in any way responsible for their actions or if they choose not to send their children to school, or if they choose to live on welfare, choose to steal? Is that your opinion - really. Why is being black an excuse for all that? Why is being Roma an excuse for stealing, living on welfare and refusing to go to school

Don't blame me for the hundred years of slavery. The Romas in Sweden are by large people that have chosen to come here. After that they have chosen not to integrate, to live on welfare and not send their children to school.

Here are some of your excuses for Romas.


&gt;You make it seem like it's a choice when for most it's not.

Of course it is. Why are the Romas not sending their children to school in Sweden and Finland when we want them too- *because it is a choice*. You lie when you say that they have no choice. 

Another one of your excuses:

&gt;Sending their kids to a school that doesn't teach about their language, culture and history is understandable. 

That is the same for every single immigration group in Sweden. Yet you excuse the Romas. They can teach their children themselves. You are just excusing them. 


Another lie.

&gt;Roma operate in tight family units where each member of the group has to contribute something.

Not in Sweden, most of them live on welfare. They contribute nothing.

The majority of England is non-Muslim. How about we force Muslims to eat non-Halal meat instead?

I'm not forced to eat Kosher. Why should I be forced to eat Halal? Why should Muslims be forced to eat meat they deem inappropriate? All meat should be labelled accordingly.

However, you seem to me like a gutless worm. Your argument is that we should all eat Halal? I ask you, why shouldn't Muslims be forced to eat non-Halal?

You put the feelings of Muslims above everybody else.

Because Hartz is paid for by different people than those that rip off employees with pittances as wage. It's another instance of a transfer from the middle class to both the poor and the rich. 

How can it be sensible to work full-time and *still* be on welfare? That just doesn't make any sense.

I remember reading a sentence like this about Bulgaria a couple of years ago. Probably in the Economist or some other mainstream thing. It said ""Look at Bulgaria: Low debt, small but positive growth, high competitiveness, a well regulated banking sector. Their standard of living may seem abysmal, but compared with Greece's crazy bubble, they have a future to look forward to"". It's pretty ironic seeing that Bulgaria is now facing months of continuous protests, with no end in sight. 

&gt; did our governments even have a plan focused on maintaining the f***ing industry?

They didn't. It was impossible to maintain our industry because it's impossible to compete with the much more advanced technology and economies of scale of the economic heavyweight countries. Once you open up those borders to free trade, the weakest economies will always lose to the stronger ones. You either make an agreement to compensate for this, or you're doomed to indebtedness and/or internal devaluation. Linking currencies together makes this process even less reversible. 

I think this is the main factor that contributes to Greece's current economic problems. The ""crazy syndicalists and corrupt oligarchs"" are a problem but not the core reason of the economic crisis, as far as I understand it.

Why is GMO technology dangerous? I do not know of any dangers that have ever been observed.


""So your solution is to put it directly into the food itself, where it is consumed by insects and bees, and eventually us.""

Chemical pesticides have usually broad effects, however for instance Bt toxins have an extremely narrow host range, so a Bt toxin protein which is extremely toxic to caterpillars is simply neutral in vertebrates, or even in hymenoptera. For instance actually many studies were conducted on bees and GMO pollen, and no toxic effect has ever been found. ( http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001415 ) So implying that Bt toxins were harmful is a simple lie. And an added benefit: Bt toxins are proteins, they are readily digested by virtually every living organism, however pesticides, as completely new, synthetysed molecules can usually not be digested by animals, so a chemical pesticide will remain in the enviroment for a long time (DDT can still be detected in water samples near the Antarctic, although it has been banned for three decades), and accumulate in the food chain, and in our system, as we act like apex predators. However Bt toxins are readily digested by our stomach, and every other animal's digestive tratct, so they will not accumulate in the food chain and in our body. So if you are affraid of toxins, you should be more affraid of ""conventional"" ones. So please, learn about thing first, genious!

"" Yes, solving the problem of putting poison on things by putting poison IN things, genius.""

Every single piece of our food contains poisons, antimicrobial peptides, chitinase enzymes, alkaloids, etc. For instance potatoes contain solanine, yet noone is concerned about it.

""There is no regulation strong enough for this science because it is profit driven""

Please show me an industry, including seed, pesticide, agricultural machinery production, which is not profit driven! This argument is simply silly.

""All your solutions are bolt on fixes for an unsustainable economic model, they solve no problems and only allow existing ones to be taped up""

true,MikeBenza,null,null,"Here's what to expect between landing and being alone in your apartment, based on my experience moving from Houston to Paris last year:

Land.  Passport control.  Optional: Have customs ignore the bird that you spent hours and hundreds of dollars getting cleared to enter France (nope, definitely not still bitter).  **Take a taxi** to your apartment OR someplace to wait while the person doing the inspection for when you move in.  Taking the RER with a lot of luggage is just plain miserable, so just drop the 50€ - 80€ on it.  It really is worth it.  If you don't have the cash, they will bring you by an ATM.  But be sure you'll be able to get cash out.  Once you get to the apartment you'll probably have an entry inspection.  This took about 2 hours.

Now, the first thing: set up essentials -- plug in your phone to charge, connect to the internet, then hand-draw a map of the neighborhood and places you need to go.

FIRST: check if you have a cork screw.

Places you need to go:

1. **Bakery**, if you find an open one.  Buy a baguette traditionelle. Bring it home and wrap it up in a dish towel help it stay fresh.  The baguette will only be fresh for a day or two.
2. **Grocery**.  Get toilet paper and enough whole foods (i.e. not processed foods) that you can eat without cooking at least until lunch on Tuesday.  Try to find high-fiber foods.  If you see a bakery, buy a baguette.  If you were able to find a bakery, get some deli meats or veggies to put on the bread.  Get some butter for the bread.  You want to eat whole foods because they're easier on your body.  You want high fiber foods to avoid sugar highs and lows that will make you tired at the wrong times.  Get a corkscrew if you don't have one.  It's called a tire-bouchon.
3. **Wine shop**.Get a decent bottle of wine from an air conditioned store -- the wine in the open-air stores is subject to a lot of temperature fluctuation and is usually crap.  Spend 10€ on it and it'll probably be good.  Use it while celebrating your first night in Paris.

If you're feeling tired / didn't sleep on the plane, take **a short nap**.  Time the nap so that after you get up you'll be getting in bed again around your normal bed time.  If you do it right there will be no jet lag.

Once you've stocked up on foods and toilet paper and if you still have time, explore your neighborhood.  Tuesday will be your day to find the nearest metros, so you'll want to have a mental map in your head tomorrow (Monday) so you can commit it to memory overnight and have a better idea of where you're going Tuesday.

If you're not too tired, it's not raining, and it's less than 30 minutes walking, walk down to the Seine around sunset with your bottle of wine and cork screw.  It's the quintessential thing to do on a summer night.  Don't kill the whole bottle yourself unless you're experienced in such things ;).  You will more than likely find other English speakers by the river, especially on the point of Île de la Cité.

On Monday, most banks are closed.  To do anything with utilities or a cell phone, you need a bank account.  To open a bank account you need a lease.  So, on Tuesday, take a copy of your lease and find a bank **near your apartment**.  You can only do banking in the branch you open your account in.  ATM withdrawls can be done anywhere, but any other banking is only at the branch you open your account in.  I had great experience with HSBC.  Plus, they usually have some English speaking bankers and they have an English customer line if your French isn't great.

Once you have a bank account, you can set up a cell phone plan.  I used [Free](http://mobile.free.fr) because they were the cheapest at the time (20€) and have good plans, but other carriers have similar plans now.  I think there's a way to set up a cell phone plan on Free without a bank account but it's hard to find.

Where in Paris are you living?  I'm back in the US now but my wife and I are going back in October for 9-10 months.  We'll be in the 7th.

That'll get you through the end of the month.  Unless you use the metro very infrequently, you'll probably want to buy a monthly [Navigo](http://www.navigo.fr/).  Check out their plans for the best option.  If you're a student (I'm guessing you are given the time of year) there's an Imagine-R card that's cheap and gets you to a lot of places.

- The news about the Syrian chemical attack has been the most prominent - the US and UK are promising 'serious' action next. Foreign Secretary William Hague seems to be getting much more vocal in opposition to Assad, demanding action from the UN. 

I'm not sure how to feel that this is *far, far* bigger news than:

- David Miranda's arrest. The Guardian attempts to fight for our right to privacy, the Conservatives are looking more and more scary every day, the opposing Labour party appear to have fallen asleep. Sadly most broadcast news outlets (the BBC especially) aren't covering it as much, neither are many of the other newspapers. We've also heard about other European news editors taking a stand against Cameron. Meanwhile, the people of Britain... honestly I don't feel much of a reaction at least within my family and friends. 

- The Royals released the first official pictures of the new Prince... unsure if anyone actually gave a shit. 

- A helicopter crashed off the coast of Scotland, four people died and their bodies recovered. Another 14 people were rescued after the helicopter apparently suffered a ""catastrophic loss of power"". All other helicopters of the same design have been grounded pending an investigation.

- A man has been arrested in North London over the shooting and killing of a 24 year old woman who was out celebrating her birthday. Police are saying that she was just ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" and wasn't the intended target. The murdered woman has a four year old son. Another 24 year old woman is still in hospital. 

- The Labour party threaten to block the new high speed rail plans in parliament (to run between London and the northern cities) if it goes too far over budget. 


- Bonus news: there was a small earthquake in Blackpool and Barrow-in-Furness measuring 2.4 and 3.2 on the Richter scale. They're fairly common in that part of the country, but never strong as you can see.

You shouldn't expect it to solve by itself or quickly in 5 to ten years. A peaceful solution will require a constant integration policy and one hundred years or more.

Definitely not Somalis. 

&gt;Don't blame me for the hundred years of slavery. The Romas in Sweden are by large people that have chosen to come here. After that they have chosen not to integrate, to live on welfare and not send their children to school.

The Roma's have been in Sweden since the 16th century. Up until 1999 when the Romas were finally recognized as one of Sweden's official minorities they were subjected to numerous acts of discrimination including eugenics. I found this out from one of the pamphlets you linked me. I suggest you take the time to read them next time.

&gt;Of course it is. Why are the Romas not sending their children to school in Sweden and Finland when we want them too- because it is a choice. You lie when you say that they have no choice.

&gt;No, so is giving them food, welfare, good schols and housing all wrong? 

I'm just going to say prove it from now on whenever you make a claim that you can't substantiate. 

&gt;So the Romas are such delicate little flowers that exactly every single thing have to be in complete accordance with their wishes?

Nobody said that. However, giving the Romas aversion towards European society, a society that discriminated against them for hundreds of years, it is understandable that, at least for the time being, certain concessions need to be made. Forcefully integrating a minority doesn't work.

&gt;Other immigrant groups adjust and contribute to society? Why can't the Romas do that? How can you excuse the fact that they don't, depsite being given fucking everything? 

Can you substantiate your claim that the Romas have been given ""fucking everything""?

&gt;You refusal to give the Romas any responsibility and excuse despicable behaviour and choose to see them as helpless victims is, apart from being racists, and sure way to make sure that the Romas will continue down the path that they have started, stealing, uneducated etc.

I do not treat the Romas as victims, I am merely pointing out that blaming their current situation entirely on them whilst completely ignoring the historical context in which it happened is ignorant and racist.

&gt;Also, as I told you that no one, Romas or not, in Sweden has to steal, or is starving. Why do you excuse Romas that do that? 

I am not excusing them, I am providing you with a reason why they might be doing that. You seem to be under the impression that I'm advocating complete and total clemency for the Roma. 

&gt;I have already answered that. Are you honestly saying that black people all over the globe are not in any way responsible for their actions or if they choose not to send their children to school, or if they choose to live on welfare, choose to steal?

Feel free to go through my comments and point out exactly where I stated that all black people are not responsible for their actions. You see, if you would have actually taken 10 minutes out of your busy strawmanning filled schedule you would have realised that my argument dealt exclusively with black people in the US, not everywhere in the world.

School is free in Sweden, for every single child. Period. End. Healtcare is free, for every single child, and same price for everyone (in Stockholm it is 1100/year for adults). That is our welfare system, which you would have known, had you bothered to inform yourself. 

If they live here, they receive the same treatment I do. Period. End. It is like asking me to prove that Sweden is a democracy and that we have the right to vote. You see everything through the eyes that Romas are victims, you can not possibly believe that they get treated like everyone else, so you refuse to accept the fact that they behave like assholes, to you they are the perpetual victims. 

In fact, you are just not interested in finding out that you might be wrong. I have sent you numerous reports, and you don't even bother to ask if the school system is free. Yes it is, for everyone. Instead, you claim that I have to prove it. Google it - school and health care is free in Sweden. Just because *you* discriminate, it doesn't mean we do.

You are the worst advocate for Romas I have encountered. In fact, you are the racists, you treat them like perpetual victims. 

And, yes, I know we have had Romas in Sweden since 1650- eight familys to be exact. Had you bothered to read some of the other reports, or my answer, you would have seen that I said 95 % (thus, excluding the few hundred that existed before the 1960) and pointing out that 95 % of the Romas arrived in Sweden after 1960. Not that you care, you are only out to prove falsehoods.

&gt;one of the links you provided talked about housing and free healthcare.

**Everyone in Sweden has it** Why do you think our welfare system is famous. Do you want me to link to the fact that we are a democracy too, or that we have a king and a parlament? 

Honestly, the only thing you have managed to do is being the worst advocate for the Romas I have seen. Not in any way have you even admitted that they are adults that makes their own choices. Or, the fact that they are resposible for the lack of intergration. You are in fact a racist, the way you exclude Romas from blame, and blame everyone else.

There are multiple factors that are contributing to the crisis. I posit that the most important factor is the loss of competitiveness because of the EU free trade and the shared currency. If you want to pretend that each country lives in a vacuum and all its problems are local and their own you're welcome to do so but it's a nonsensical position to have. 

At the same time, of course I'll blame the Greek people and the Greek government in particular for their part in the whole mess. I don't really like how everyone keeps accusing me that I'm just avoiding ""my own responsibilities"". But to reply to your accusation more thoroughly:

&gt; At least bulgarians realized that, which is why they're protesting. 

The Bulgarians are protesting the shitty situation they're in. That does not imply that their problems are only local. I want Greeks to protest their government too. When the Greeks were angry at their government and wanted to vote it out, everyone at /r/europe and the European governments warned us against it. They said we should not dare change our government and we should just keep following their orders. So much for that. 

&gt; Their currency is pegged to the euro (to put it mildly) after the hell they've been through in '96-'97, so stop blaming that either.

Greece is in a shitty situation and has its currency pegged to the euro. Bulgaria is in a shitty situation and has its currency pegged to the euro.

Most banks are not too accepting of people not having a lease or at least proof of residency. Try and talk to Mrs. Clam, Societe Generale Versailles, Rue Paroisse. She speaks English as well if needs be.

&gt; For cell phones, are they included in plans? If not, where can I buy one? Is there a French equivalent to Future Shop or Best Buy? Are phone prices similar to those in North America?

I'm not sure about the prices in NA but the prices are ok'ish in France and phones are included in most contracts unless you don't want one. Many phones are sold for, say, 350€ but you're getting 200€ back after sending some papers in, weird stuff but yeah that's how it is. The equivalent to best buy would be Boulanger, Darty or FNAC although you can often get better deals from the carriers themselves. 

There's an Orange shop at the market place in Versailles and there's also an SFR shop as well, east corner of the market place. If you want a prepaid card and have problems getting one I can help you with that since they require proof of residency etc. as well - contracts require that too, obviously.

&gt; For an apartment, I've heard of many many fees when first moving in, often climbing over 1000€+ before even paying rent. Any insight on that?

Most flats are offered through agencies. My old flat in Versailles (near the Saint-Louis Cathedral) set me back 550€ a month. When I moved in I had to pay 600€ to the agency (their fee) and 1100€ (deposit). The fee for the agency can vary but it's at least one months rent iirc.

If you're moving to Versailles, try and avoid Le Chesnay unless you get a really good deal on a flat up there.

Just because reforms need to be made, it doesn't necessarily mean they have to be the Anglo-liberalizing sort. France needs French solutions, not American solutions.

Why are they here then? 95  % of them have come in the last  40 years. One has an obligation, as I am sure you know, as an immigrant, or, just as any citizen/resident of a country/ place. Romas shouldn't be excluded, and if they *choose* not to integrate, it is *their* fault, not ours.  

&gt;That's the Swedish approach to every misfits.

I know, and I am certainly not saying it is perfect. In fact, I hate it at times (but that a whole different discussion). However, everyone claims that the ""Romas are like thieves and uneducated because they live bad, no health care, no schools, are poor etc. Well, we Swedes have removed all those excuses and they still behave like assholes. And, they have the worst stats of any immigration group, including Somalis and Afghanistani people. So, the problem is not poverty, lack of health care, lack of housing and/or discrimination in school, because they have the same chances as everyone else here. The problem is with them then. So, I wish people like BonanzaCreek would stop blaming poverty and lack of health care- cause I don't think that is the issue here. As you know, no one in Sweden has to steal, it is a choice. No one starves, and everyone can go to a, at least OK school. So, it by choice they are criminals and don't go to school.


&gt;they don't know anything better

I don't buy that. To claim that is to make them infantile/victimise them.  Who doesn't know that one shouldn't steal and should go to school? As a (Roma) person said in one of the articles I posted, he said that they do not *want* to send their children to school because they fear integration and do not want to be part of Swedish society. Well, they have no problem accepting benefits, but they do not want to contribute. Are you saying that grown Romas can't make that analyses? Of course they can. They are adults, and just as smart/stupid as everyone else. They just choose not to integrate. 


&gt;The key is the education,finding a role for them in the society that can be acceptable for everybody for the current generation, and education(and your are being lucky if the first native generation gets basic education).

Well, in a modern society there aren't roles for people who can't read, treat women like shit, steal and live on welfare. They are of course welcome to school, or other forms of work education, but the fact is, they do not want to.

The judgment says:

&gt; The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) noted that the channelling of Roma children to special schools for those with mental retardation was reportedly often “quasi-automatic”

In the test case submitted, in the town of Ostrava, more than half of all Roma children were placed in these schools. This situation appears to have been going on for at least thirty years. As they say:

&gt; ...as a result of the arrangements the applicants were placed in schools for children with mental disabilities where a more basic curriculum was followed than in ordinary schools and where they were isolated from pupils from the wider population. As a result, they received an education which compounded their difficulties and compromised their subsequent personal development instead of tackling their real problems or helping them to integrate into the ordinary schools and develop the skills that would facilitate life among the majority population. Indeed, the Government have implicitly admitted that job opportunities are more limited for pupils from special schools.

And I have responded to the sources that were a language I could understand. I have pointed out to you on numerous occasions that I do not speak Swedish.

&gt;Again, I have- Read for example the one about the school. It was in English, and it proves again that you are just out to fight for what ever opinoion you have, not finding out the truth. School is free in Sweden, for every single child. Period. End.

This was my reply to the education link you provided:

""From the ""Education of Young Romas in Sweden"" link: ""Most people of Romani origin are to a great extent subject to ethnic discrimination and harassment, very few report though. The hidden statistics with re gard to the extent of the ethnic discrimination against the people of Romani origin is very larg e. Also in the schools, the Romani pupils witness about being discriminated against by teachers a nd other pupils. In a study carried out by the Ombudsman against Ethnic Discrimination, 50 per cent of the respondents said that they had not conveyed their Romani origin in order to sav e themselves from the negative behaviour from the majority society.""

In the future I suggest you read the sources you link to as opposed to just Googling ""Romas are bad"" and copy-pasting the first few results.

&gt;If they live here, they receive the same treatment I do. Period. End. It is like asking me to prove that Sweden is a democracy and that we have the right to vote. You see everything through the eyes that Romas are victims, you can not possibly believe that they get treated like everyone else, so you refuse to accept the fact that they behave like assholes, to you they are the perpetual victims. 

Really? Because your own government disagrees with you on that one. To quote:

""Most people of Romani origin are to a great extent subject to ethnic discrimination and harassment, very few report though. The hidden statistics with re gard to the extent of the ethnic discrimination against the people of Romani origin is very larg e. Also in the schools, the Romani pupils witness about being discriminated against by teachers a nd other pupils. In a study carried out by the Ombudsman against Ethnic Discrimination, 50 per cent of the respondents said that they had not conveyed their Romani origin in order to sav e themselves from the negative behaviour from the majority society.""

This was just the quote I had on hand. There are more examples, from the very links you posted here I might add, but I have a feeling you'll just ignore them.

&gt;And, yes, I know we have had Romas in Sweden since 1650- eight familys to be exact. Had you bothered to read some of the other reports, or my answer, you would have seen that I said 95 % (thus, excluding the few hundred that existed before the 1960) and pointing out that 95 % of the Romas arrived in Sweden after 1960. Not that you care, you are only out to prove falsehoods.

Let's see. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1kva97/for_europes_roma_racism_gets_worse_in_tough/cbv30gy?context=3) is the comment you're replying to. In that comment I was addressing your claim that Sweden did not historically discriminate against the Roma using information taken from the very links you provided. 

Also, I would like to see the report used to substantiate your claim that 95% of the Romas arrived in Sweden after 1960. In English, if that wasn't clear already. Alternatively, please provide the quotation in Swedish and I'll have a go at translating it.

&gt;Everyone in Sweden has it Why do you think our welfare system is famous. Do you want me to link to the fact that we are a democracy too, or that we have a king and a parlament? 

No, I want you to prove your claim that Romas have free housing. 

&gt;And- what blacks are you referring to. 

The dark skinned ones.

Here is some ""informed"" facts.

Assad has never used chemical weapons in the entire 2 year civil war

The Syrian Army scored Major victories in the last 3 months that have crippled the Rebels position and morale including the take over of dozens of previously held rebel towns.

The Rebels started a massive offensive in the Lattakia Region 2 weeks before the Chemical Attacks in hopes that it would trigger a world wide call for Jihad after they became victorious. The SAA destroyed the rebels in Latakia within a week, all positions destroyed, thousands dead.

ONE DAY after UN Chemical Weapons Inspectors arrive and 15 MINUTES(by car) from there location a Chemical Weapons attack happened(convenient)

The SAA has told the UN they are allowed to enter the area with their protection, the Rebels have said they do not want the chemical weapons inspectors to be there(i wonder why)

So far the Syrian Rebels COmmander Idriss best proof of Assad using the weapons were ""facebook comments"" http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a35_1377123341

The SAA have found Rebels tunnels around the region which contain the raw materials for Chemical Weapons

Russia/Syrian government has been screaming since the moment this has happened that this is a false flag setup by the rebels or an outside force.

Think about it genius, why the FUCK would ASsad after 2 years in war never using these weapons . . after scoring MAJOR victories in the last few months and also a SINGLE DAY after UN CW inspectors arrive use them now? Use your brain you idiot . .  almost every major war the US has been involved in the last 60 years has started with False Flags that have been confirmed decades later . . Vietnam, Iraq are best examples of this.

I personally do not believe that Assad OR the rebels are responsible for this chemical attack . .  there is a 3rd force involved in this and there are many possibilities of who it could be.

Well, not in Sweden. We don't have communities like that. 

&gt; Hundreds of persons can stop an eviction, whatever the law says. And this was normal Spanish people.

Again, I know all your focus is on Spain, but this is Sweden. Hundreds of people do not have the right to stop an eviction, and I honestly think it would harm the Romas more if they went out in thousands on the street. SD would gain 5% immediatetly. 


&gt;You can expect that a community stay together and fights if you try to break them

I am not trying to break anyone. Parents who deny their children their right to education are horrible people and really bad parents. For the sake of the children, it is necessary to remove them from bad parents. We do that every day in Sweden and I think we should continue. In the end, the loosers are the children who grows up with horrible parents. It is so much better to let them grow up and get a decent education. 

&gt;And the worst thing for any society is trying to stole their children.

no one is stealing children. Let them go to school, and all will be fine. They have a choice, yet you are apologetic for horrible bad parenting. Why should we care less about the Roma children. They deserve education more than anyone. If their parents are so horrible and bad that they will not let them go to school - well it is our obligation to save them. Roma parents seem to be really bad and I think it is of uttermost importance to remove children from parents that have that negative effect on their education. 

&gt;From their POV: You are trying that their children stop being one of them after surviving hundreds of years of prosecution. I would be surprised if everything goes fine.

Oh, for fucks sake. Don't blame what people do today on history. One can *always* blame every single thing on history. No black in the US can ever, ever, succeed, women will always be at disadvantage - etc, etc. However, that is not only an idiotic and incorrect attitude, it victimises everybody and is extremely unhelpful

What is worse, you do not treat Roma like adults, that can make smart choices. That is actually very racist of you. They have every chance to make informed choices. Just because they, at some point, in another country, weren't on top of the food chain, is *no excuse* for behaving like assholes here. Do you make that excuse for everyone? Women, due to centuries of mistreatment and abuse can not make informed deciscions? Honour killings among Kurds are OK for example, since Kurds have had it rough? The Romas, who has a despicalble attitude towards women/equality - do you consider that OK? 

Explain to me why Romas can not make smart and informed deciscions? 

You refuse to see that they are adults, making choices? What other ""races""/categories/nationalities do you mean can not make informed wise deciscions? Swedes? Kurds? Women? Spanish?Basques?

&gt;The black people have the highest crime rate and the lowest income in the US. This problems aren't solve in one generation.

The blacks were forced to come to the US as slaves. Hardly the case with the Romas where 95 % of them has chosen to come here. And, no one in the US absolves the black people from responsibility. Nor is there any reason why Romas who are horrible parents should be excused for that. We owe it to the Romas children to remove them if their parents are so bad. 

&gt;Does your government has passed laws that can't enforce and then tried to enforce them? 

Yes, for example with wolf hunting. Not that that have anything to do with the fact that the Romas choose not to integrate and are horrible parents who chooses not to send their children to school. Also, they live on welfare most of them.  

&gt;BTW, I am not talking about races anywhere.

I know, I said it within brackets, because you excused Romas for being assholes, due to centuries of mistreatment. I don't know what to call them apart from race, but if you have a better name, I am happy. Are women excused for horrible behaviour due to centuries of mistreatment that goes on to this day? Kurds? No, of course not, and neither are the Romas excused in any way. They are grown people who choose to be horrible parents. That is unforgivable.

Your image is accurate. Going past the knee-jerk reaction in March, the criticism is either directed to the previous government and Central Bank management, or the current government (or the last 7 governments, for those with a bit more insight).

&gt; Take Angela Merkel and Greece, she didn't destroy the Greek economy. 

Agreed. 

&gt; German/EU money should be welcomed.

The Greek debt restructuring was welcome (although it really harmed Cyprus, but that's cause our bankers are idiots). The conditions that came without are those criticised. Conditions that in four years were proven harmful to the recovery. And it's mostly IMFs influence there, because they act upon ideology.

&gt; I just think it's misguided, that people from Spain to Greece are blaming the EU for this crisis.

I believe you are focusing on fringe nationalists that always wanted out of EU anyway. (eg for Greece those would be KKE from the left wing and ANEL and Golden Dawn from the right wing). Mainstream oppositions goes against the IMF policies that have proven themselves to be harmful, not the European Union. The mainstream opposition in Greece is pro-EU and pro-Eurozone, just don't think that the IMF wants to help Greece and the Eurozone. 

&gt; The EU could be the solution as well.

Again, agreed. On a personal level, it would take way, way much more misfortunes to make me think that Cyprus would be better of outside EU.

""Why that first line, at precisely the moment when she had begun to die? What was
the hidden message she saw before her, assuming there are such things as hidden
messages rather than mere coincidences.
Underneath an illustration of the computer game, the journalist began his article by
asking: ‘Where is Slovenia?’
‘Honestly,’she thought, ‘no one ever knows where Slovenia is.’
But Slovenia existed nonetheless, and it was outside, inside, in the mountains
around her and in the square she was looking out at: Slovenia was her country.
She put the magazine to one side, there was no point now in getting indignant with
a world that knew absolutely nothing about the Slovenes; (...)

‘If they don’t know where Slovenia is, then Ljubljana must be a myth,’ she thought.
Like Atlantis or Lemuria, or the other lost continents that fill men’s imaginations. No
one, anywhere in the world, would begin an article asking where Mount Everest was,
even if they had never been there. Yet, in the middle of Europe, a journalist on an
important magazine felt no shame at asking such a question, because he knew that
most of his readers would not know where Slovenia was, still less its capital, Ljubljana. It was then that Veronika found a way of passing the time, now that ten minutes
had gone by and she had still not noticed any bodily changes. The final act of her life
would be to write a letter to the magazine, explaining that Slovenia was one of the five
republics into which the former Yugoslavia had been divided.
The letter would be her suicide note. She would give no explanation of the real
reasons for her death.
When they found her body, they would conclude that she had killed herself because
a magazine did not know where her country was.""

true,embicek,CZEC,Czech Republic,"The quote is a very fine opinion of people living in a glass tower, generously dispensing high-minded advice left and right.


I remember a newspaper from the 70's, boasting that now over half of Czechoslovak gypsy children attend grammar school. The newspaper reminded that twenty years ago this number was exactly zero. 


These above mentioned special schools were not invented to keep the gypsy permanently down but to help children unable to cope with traditional grammar schools (which were quite demanding, somehow comparable to stereotypical East-Asian schools today, I read). These schools were for kids who were mentally weak or didn't get proper upbringing in their early years. Classes were much smaller (traditional class could had up to 30 pupils), had teachers with special training and  could dedicate lot of time to overcome problems of individual kids (there was no time or people for this in a traditional school).


The high percentage of gypsy kids in such schools was no secret and neither were the reasons why. The main was the neglect in early years (you should see how a typical gypsy village settlement in east Slovakia looks even today). Low average IQ didn't help either. 


The other option was to force them into normal schools and completely eliminate their already low chance to learn anything and in the process also demolish the education for kids without problems.  Or the authorities could wash up their hands and resign on any education of unfit kids, like it is commonly done throughout Western Europe. 


This horrible system was able to produce highest literacy among gypsies in whole Europe (read this somewhere, don't have reference at hand). 


If you are unconvinced by my rant, rejoice. Tomorrow belongs to you. Czech governments during the last 20 years successfully devastated the once famous schooling system. Czech kids are no longer competing in maths with East-Asians. The quality of education had worsened in every aspect. Gone are the methods that worked so well for long time, gone is the generous financial support from the state.

Even those horrible special schools are destined to die. The government had already formally renamed them (they are now simply called schools) and soon the kids with learning disabilities will have to move into normal  schools. The first known results are promising. Problematic kids don't learn anything and normal kids get distracted and bored and they too fail. Eventually, everyone is equal, down in deep shit. The good people from ECRI will be finally happy.

It can hardly be worse than it is now. They are growing up to have children young, do drugs, illiterate, going to jail, welfare recipients, costing society millions per person. What on earth could be worse. The only thing I can see is the most horrible of people trying to leave. I am two minds about that - I don't mind if the parents leave and it is a legal right to move abroad, but we should keep and educate the child perhaps. 

&gt;It's an important point in Spanish history when the government tried to regulate the clothing for security reasons in the middle of an economic crisis. 

But clothing for security reasons it is certainly not the same as standing up for the Roma children. They need to be protected from horrible people who stop them from going to school. That is our obligation as a society. The children deserve an education and we need to fight the assholes who are trying to stop it. You do not seem to be aware of the fact that the only ones opposing to Romas in schools are the Romas themselves. That is truly horrible. I want the parents who are not sending their children to school to be sentenced, and called out. And, the Roma community should be aware of the fact that it is their fault, only theirs, if the children get removed. Children deserve an education. If some of the Roma parents are such bad and horrible people that they deny them that, they should loose their children. Period. I can not stand people who ruin for their children on purpose. Many Roma parents do that. There is no excuse for it, none.  

&gt;Then, you have more leverage than others countries use it wisefully. 

That is not connected to going to school. We have, together with Germany, some of the harshest laws about schooling. We are just not enforcing it with the romas, which are creating generations of half illeterate welfare people who refuse to integrate. I think 

&gt;BTW, if the confrontation is too big the integration/assimilation slows down, not the opposite.

A) Proof. B) it is not to big to take care of Roma children when their parents and their community chooses not to. that is good, children need to be taken care of.

Here's why ;) The media have their interests. They need to portray Greece in a certain light. And it doesn't help that you can't really have a banner saying ""I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE MONETARY UNION"", it's awkward and not camera-friendly. So those who want to equate Merkel with Hitler get the screen-time because their banners are more controversial and less sophisticated. 

Admittedly, I can only get the full spectrum of reactions in Greece only because there's no language barrier. If I didn't speak Greek, I'd believe that there are only two camps of people in Greece, as this is how the media want to play it. Even domestic (Greek) media. 

&gt; I was actually thinking about more average attitudes towards the whole European project. 

Well, as I said, the mainstream opposition on a political level is pro-EU *and* Eurozone. And everyday people I have discussed it with do not want to be isolated from EU.

No it isn't. Having to pay more than one's annual income in taxes is absurd. And for the US figures a percentage accurately shows that the rich pay the bulk of taxes.

&gt;The reason the rich pay such a large percentage of the taxes is because they are disgustingly wealthy. If you earn such a huge amount then you don't need all of it.

So basically your greed and jealousy entitles you to violate the property rights of others?

&gt;There is no justification for people having such enormous amounts of money

Sure there is: they earned it. It's theirs. 

&gt;while others live shitty lives, don't eat properly and can't give their kids a good living.

The difference between you and the mega-rich is smaller than the difference between you and the global poor. If you want to be consistent in your rhetoric, you realize that you're just as disgustingly wealthy in a global perspective as the mega rich, right?

Functional Literacy of Roma among Working Age Population:

* 44% - Almost zero capability of understanding the language of
institutions, competence of understanding hypothetical questions less than 40%, numeric literacy almost zero, inability of solving simplest arithmetic operation

* 44% – Basic orientation in institutional language, competence
of understanding hypothetical questions 40% at least, numeric literacy and legal conscience at a substandard level.

60% of the total population had no more than primary school education! This is like something out of the 19th century. Horrible system indeed.

&gt; The other option was to force them into normal schools and completely eliminate their already low chance to learn anything and in the process also demolish the education for kids without problems.

Or, rather than consigning them to an education reserved for the mentally deficient, you could have given them remedial help, or even introduced mandatory nursery school education.

There's a case study of 60 Roma kids from Slovakia and the Czech Republic, 85% of whom were placed in 'special' schools in those countries. In British schools, 2-4% were judged as having learning difficulties, and as a cohort, their academic performance was just below the national average.
