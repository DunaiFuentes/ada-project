true,vishbar,UNSA,American living in the UK,"I'm American, and my experience was not strictly asked for, but when has that ever stopped an American from butting in? My experience seems fairly similar to other people here.

I graduated a few years ago, so my memory is a bit hazy during high school. One thing to note: while we don't have GCSE/A-levels like the UK, we have AP courses, which involve an external exam and are similar to A-levels. Students can choose different paths if they like, this was just what I chose. Also, it's worth noting that American schools can differ greatly depending on the state and district. I was in South Carolina--one of the worst states in the union for education--but I was in a really good SC public school (most of the bad schools in SC are in the really poor areas, unfortunately).  Anyhow...

* 9th grade (14) - Algebra II - advanced quadratic formulas (we learned the basics in 7th and 8th grade), more advanced algebra (we learned basic algebra and quadratics in 7th grade, we got into logs and such here). That's about all I remember specifically. Even though it was called Algebra, it was more just general math - we did basic probabilities, geometry, trig, etc. too. We also expanded on our proof techniques--proofs were first introduced in 8th grade, but we continued using them throughout my high school career.

* 10th grade - Pre-Calculus - Functions and function composition,  imaginary arithmatic (with imaginary planes and stuff), basic derivation--we learned to describe domains and such of functions, that kind of thing. Basically introducing us to the basics of calculus. More advanced trig functions and radial graphing too. Also I recall some early discreet mathematics. We did matrix multiplication and solving equations with matrices too.

* 11th grade - AP Statistics - note that I chose to take this rather than calculus in 11th grade, I probably should have gone for calc next. Anyway, statistical modeling, Z-scores, all that good stuff.

* 12th grade - AP Calculus - integrations, derivations, sums, modeling real life stuff with integrals, that kind of thing. Basic vector fields and such too.

EDIT: for some reason I thought it was secondary math only.

In elementary school (1st-5th grade, ages 6-11), we learned just basic stuff: addition, multiplication, patterns, measurement. Like you we also did basic geometry (volumes, pythagorean theorem). One fact you may find interesting: I remember being taught in exclusively SI units. We measured length in meters and cm,  temperature in C, volume in milliliters and liters, and mass in grams. Obviously we used imperial in our daily lives, but we were exposed to SI. In middle school (6th-8th grades, 11-14), we began ""named"" math classes (and ability streaming began).  My classes in middle school were:

* Pre-Algebra - 6th grade: basic introduction to equation-solving and algebraic concepts. I *believe* we used trig functions for the first time, but not much beyond ""This is what they are, here's how you can solve for an unknown side of a triangle"".

* Algebra I - 7th grade: algebraic functions, equation solving, quadratic functions. We did basic matrix operations either here or in 8th grade.

* Geometry - 8th grade: trig functions, trig identities, introduction to geometric proofs, shape functions and angle properties, etc. I don't remember too many specifics.

Believe me, for the people who died in Polish anti-jew progroms, there was nothing hypothetical about it.

Hardly genocides. Hell, as a German I didn't even hear about the Namaqua before today - and frankly, neither seems Wikipedia. I think you mean ""Nama"". The Herero and the Nama uprisings were insurrections  and bandit attacks against German colonists. POWs were taken and put into camps that were ill-supplied, which lead to preventable deaths. 

The actions of von Trotha were outside of his jurisdiction, not checked with his surperiors and made him shunned in German society. Do not mistake the actions of one man with a planned genocide.

That is a question to be argued about. On which scale do you think the Holocaust was the biggest genocide of the 20^th century? Percentage of targeted group killed? Head counts?

In normal circumstances, if an EU country would default on its debts, it would be private investors taking the hit, this wouldn't be a problem. However tax payers of other EU countries have given huge loans to Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland via different EU programs. If any of these countries would make a default that included defaulting these European loans, it would cause an uproar in countries that had loaned these monies at the first place.

Another note is that membership in the Eurozone is treaty obligation that EU countries need to satisfy. If an EU country is deemed on not working to enter the Eurozone, that it is braking of a treaty obligation, so is leaving the Eurozone.

Greece did a so called ""structural default"" where it pressured creditors to accept ""free willingly"" restructuring of loans or risk an actual default. Do note that some investors actually didn't accept it and enjoyed huge profits on not doing so.

However what Greece hasn't done is to default its European loans. These are loans from other EU countries arranged via EU, the so called bail-out loans. Now if Greece would default these or there would be attempt to restructure these loans, there would be a major backlash in EU countries that have given these loans.

&gt; So defaulting on some of your external debt is certainly possible inside the common market, it's already been done by Greece. The question is, is leaving the euro?

Leaving the Euro would be a treaty violation, all EU countries except UK and Denmark are required to be or to part take into single currency. Leaving the single currency would be a major treaty violation.

Look kiddo. Trolls aren't funny. They don't try to be funny. Satirists and circlejerkers try to be funny. Trolls get people irate to the point of wasting their time looking for things online to prove the troll wrong. Thank you for making my day.

For your information, my view is that there is an unhealthy undertone in current feminist rhetoric that demonises stay-at-home moms for somehow 'letting the side down'. It's patronising and an unnecessary slap in the face to women who voluntarily choose forego a career and raise their kids. But fuck that, right? They should use childcare and go get a job. Housewives shouldn't exist at all, and men should behave exactly how your studies prescribe.

In a way I'm glad you brought up all those studies, because it highlights a constant misinterpretation which has wound its way into the debate. The promotion of egalitarian parenting is not the same as the destruction of the housewife ideal, as has been directly expressed elsewhere in the thread. That's my beef with the feminist argument. I support both my wife's desire to have a career and my sister's choice to be a stay-at-home mom. Feminism does not, yet it claims to be for all women everywhere. It is not.

The thing that I've enjoyed the most about this whole thing is that you accuse me of forcing a lifestyle onto women, when in reality that's you and your studies. I have at no point said that women don't belong in the workplace or that men belong out of the home. But thanks for putting the words in my mouth and displaying flagrant hypocrisy in the process. You think I'm some patriarchal misogynist who oppresses women? Fuck yourself, you impudent child. You just got pwned, and it was a joy to be a part of it. Have a good day, dickwad.

Could you elaborate on this? 


&gt; So how come we can still borrow at negative interest rate? 

According to LSE, the reason your country can borrow at a lower rate than an equally indebted EZ country is because your CB has a lot more credibility than the ECB.

&gt; It's because there is great faith in our economy, due to very high rates of investment and stability, which is a direct consequence of ~~accountability and lack of corruption~~ have a competent central bank... and not being subject to either incompetent EU institutions, or German aggression.

That's why scandinavian labor is so cheap. right? 

&gt; In some countries in the EU today, it is even necessary to pay simple bribes to get anything done

Yeah, but that is mostly the non-crisis-having region called Eastern Europe, where the EBRD actually did it's job, and countries have the own monetary authorities, who among other things, take an active role in regulating financial markets. 

&gt; Have you actually ever been outside whatever Southern country you are from? Efficiency means being able to do things at minimum cost.

Cute. In my country, our institutions are competent enough, such that the bankruptcy of a region with 10 million inhabitants doesn't cause five years of unmitigated economic disaster across our entire continent. /r/MURICA

Despite having less efficiency (in terms of productivity per hour) than many EU countries, It takes a larger earthquake than that to put our economy into long-term hurt. 

In any case, I'm resident in Belgium... you know,,, one of those EU countries whose per capita commitment to the EU is larger than that of Germany, but who has to pay the increased risk spreads, only because of German intransigence/EU incompetence.

It scans around the room and see's England, Scotland and Wales chatting about soccer across the room, good place to start and they're all on the pints too.

After a while, some of the other countries are coming over to mingle with their little group, they know England, who's a popular country but a little self conscious. Suddenly Ireland is chatting away to a country it's never met before, like their best friends. It's Hungary, someone Ireland never expected to be so much craic for some strange reason. 

A few drinks in and it's smiling and laughing away, people are wondering how much it's had to drink but it's not much more than some of the other guests. It's 12 o'clock and he's looking around at some of the other countries, the Netherlands and Portugal have gone off together, it wonders who it could get with. He'd like a bit of Austria, the Ukraine is looking well, then it hits him, they're all super good looking. What a party.

It's 3 in the morning now, the music has been turned off but people don't want to go home. Ireland starts singing, it's spontaneous so it's not quite sure of the words but everyone approves. Spain has the next song and then Italy belts one out.

The next morning is confusing. What was Denmark giving me to drink? I hope I wasn't singing. Did I break up that fight between France and Germany or did I start it? What were they even fighting over? Switzerland?

Next weekend I'm going to take it easy, just stay in and drink some cans I think.

Is that a veiled threat? See, this is why people are lining up to exit the Eurozone. It's all built on mutual distrust and national self-interest. I understand that they wouldn't like it but would they resort to breaking up the EU?

&gt; Another note is that membership in the Eurozone is treaty obligation that EU countries need to satisfy. If an EU country is deemed on not working to enter the Eurozone, that it is braking of a treaty obligation, so is leaving the Eurozone.

You know full well that these treaties can be overlooked when it is deemed impractical to follow them to the letter. It has happened before. 

&gt; It is intellectual dishonesty to not talk about what happens to debt. The debt is so important part of the whole equation that any book that suggest leaving the Eurozone has to answer a question on how debt will be handled.

Another straw-man. Did I say we should not talk about what happens to the debt? Did the author of that book say that?

It is not a veiled threat, it is a fact of life. And what goes to distrust, the distrust was largely created by troubled countries themselves. For example multiple Greek governments had committed fraud, falsifying state finances. Not to mention Cyprus which ran a huge money laundering business; Portugal that didn't make any structural changes when its economy was stagnating even before the financial crisis; Spain where corruption and fraud created a huge property and construction bubble, nobody did nothing to prevent it; Ireland the same...

Excuse me, but the markets loss confidence to these countries long since. Other Eurozone countries had to run to help them, but help has its limits too. How can you really justify that Finnish tax euros should go to these troubled countries instead being used in Finland to help Finnish citizens in need or to be used to build up this country? Already Finnish taxpayers are net contributors in the EU, how much more should they contribute? 

&gt; You know full well that these treaties can be overlooked when it is deemed impractical to follow them to the letter. It has happened before. 

Single currency is an essential component of the single market, the single market can't work without the single currency. This is a place were so much money and interests are vested that there is hardly any possibility to overlook it.

&gt;  Another straw-man. Did I say we should not talk about what happens to the debt? Did the author of that book say that? You're just assuming that it's important and you're assuming all your ""opponents"" overlook it so that you can make an easy argument.

The amount of commission depends on the Bundesland. The highest percentage can be found in Berlin (6%+taxes for buying). I'm working in hessia and we ask for 5%+taxes which is the second highest. For renting it's 2xKaltmiete+taxes. 
I absolutely agree that the landlords/owners should pay for commission (at least in bavaria they usually share it with the buying party). But if a law forces them to do so the prices will just go up because they add commission to the price. It might appear fair then but you'll still pay for it.

[**The European Council**](http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-institution?lang=en)


The European Council is the meeting place of the various heads-of-government or heads-of-state of all EU member countries, plus the President (currently Herman van Rompuy). The European Council is tasked with defining the general directions and policies to be carried out by the rest of the EU. The body is intergovernmentally, meaning that the member states meet on governmental level and decide by consensus.


The European Council should not be confused with the...


[**Council of the European Union**](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/council?lang=en)


The Council of the EU, also called Council of Ministers or sometimes just Council, is the body where the governments of the EU member states meet on minister level - for example, in the Foreign Affairs Council, all foreign ministers meet, discuss a certain topic and potentially pass legislation. The Council could also be called the ""first chamber"" of the EU legislation process. Depending on the issue, it decides either by consensus (e. g. in foreign, security and defence affairs) or by qualified majority voting. At the moment, a qualified majority is reached 


&gt; if a majority of Member States approve (in some cases a two-thirds majority);
a minimum of 255 votes is cast in favour of the proposal, out of a total of 345 votes.


Neither the European Council or the Council of the EU should be confused with the [Council of Europe](http://hub.coe.int/). This is a completely different international organization. 


[**The European Parliament**](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/00b3f21266/At-your-service.html;jsessionid=083255C823C77C4397FC6CB8DFA231C6.node2) 


The European Parliament (EP) is the only directly elected body of the EU. The members of the European Parliament (MEP) are representatives from the member countries but working in the interests of all EU citizens. The number of seats every country is allocated is loosely based on the number of citizens the respective country possesses. The allocation is not directly proportional however - citizens per MEP is 852.083 for Germany for example while it is 68.833 for Malta ([Source Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degressive_Proportionalit%C3%A4t)). If it were directly proportional, then the bigger countries would have to get more seats which could make the parliament so big that it is not able to work properly any more, or the smaller states would have to lose several seats and would not be able any more to accurately represent their domestic political diverseness. 


The European Parliament is the ""second chamber"" of the EU legislation process. It works similarly to domestic parliaments and elections take place every five years in all EU countries. The Parliament has come a long way in regards to its significance in the legislation process and today almost all policy fields require the so-called [""co-decision"" mechanism](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/0042423726/Parliament-and-the-Lisbon-Treaty.html) which includes the EP. The EP does not, however, have the right to initiate new legislation. This right is exclusively exercised by the Council of the EU and the...


[**European Commission**](http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm)


The European Commission is a supranational body, working in the interests of the Union as a whole and not representing individual member countries' interests. It is made up of the [Commissioners](http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/index_en.htm), currently one sent from each member country, which are tasked with a specific field, e. g. transport, energy or trade. They could be compared to ""EU ministers/secretaries"". As said, the Commission has the right to initiate new legislation that, depending on the issue, is either decided upon by the Council, or by the Council and the EP together. 


The Commission is also responsible for watching over the compliance by member states with EU legislation. If it finds that a member country is in breach of EU legislation, it tries the member state before the...


[**Court of Justice of the European Union**](http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_6999/)


The CoJ is, as the name suggests, the official court of the European Union and, as outlined above, for example responsible for ensuring that the member countries observe the law of the EU. It has often been called the ""motor of EU integration"" because of the way it interpreted and developed further the body of European law. In instances where certain issues were discussed before the Court but without EU legislation dealing precisely with it, the Court developed general guidelines and fundamentals based on the constitutional tradition of its member states as well as international and other European law. It has thus contributed to further European integration. 


The two most important pieces of EU legislation are...


[**Directives**](http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/introduction/what_directive_en.htm)


Directives, as the link says, lay down certain end results that all member states are supposed to achieve in their respective jurisdictions. They are, however, free to decide on how exactly they want to implement the EU directive. Usually these directives include a set date until which every EU member has to implement domestic legislation pertaining to the end results of the directive. If they do not meet these dates, sanctions by the Court could be enacted. 


The other kind of important legislation are the...


[**Regulations**](http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/introduction/what_regulation_en.htm)


In contrast to directives, regulations do not need to be individually implemented by the EU member states. Instead, as soon as they are passed by the legislation process of the Union, they become binding law to and in all member states. Easy as that. 


Some other important agencies of the EU are for example the...


[**European External Action Service**](http://www.eeas.europa.eu/index_en.htm)


The European External Action Service (EEAS) is a relatively new agency that works similar to domestic foreign services. It employs diplomats and other civil servants from the member states as well as other bodies of the EU and runs embassies abroad. It it also responsible for carrying out the [Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP)](http://www.eeas.europa.eu/cfsp/index_en.htm) and the [Common Security and Defence Policy](http://consilium.europa.eu/eeas/security-defence/csdp-structures-and-instruments?lang=en) (CSDP, which is part of the CFSP). The EEAS is headed by the [High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy](http://www.eeas.europa.eu/ashton/index_en.htm), currently Catherine Ashton, the ""EU foreign minister"". The High Representative also heads the [European Defence Agency](http://www.eda.europa.eu/). The EEAS possesses limited intelligence capabilities.

Queste strampalate commistioni derivano dalla doppia dipendenza dell'Arma dal Min. della Difesa e dal Min. degli affari Interni. In pratica l'Arma ha due principali missioni, la prima (dipendenza dalla Difesa) di polizia militare e operazioni speciali fuori area, la seconda (dipendenza dagli Interni et. al.) di ordine pubblico.

La GdF, come dimostrato dalle stellette al bavero (art.17 RDM) è forza armata, ma anche qui... Essa non dipende dal Ministero della Difesa, non ha parte nel Consiglio supremo di difesa, i suoi vertici non fanno parte del comitato dei capi di stato maggiore.

Per quanto mi riguarda, non biasimo nessuno quando si tratta di fare distinguo: a volte è complicato persino per noi.  L'unico modo per non sbagliare è guardare ai compiti istituzionali, da cui la tradizionale distinzione tra FF.AA. e forze dell'Ordine (e similia).

Nel quadro generale, questo vale anche per le differenze tra FF.AA. e altri corpi armati dello Stato.

Die CDU Unterstützt in Form der jeweiligen Landesbildungsminister und vorallem in Form von der Dr-Titel-Betrüger-Nachfolgerin-von-Frau-Schavan, Frau Wanka, eine schlechte Schulreform.
(http://www.welt.de/newsticker/news3/article109105874/Bildungskonferenz-Neues-Schulgesetz-kommt-erst-2014-15.html)

In 2 von 6 CDU/CSU regierten Bundesländern ist es ein Pflichtfach..also nichtmal 50% der CDU Bildungsminister sind dafür.

Da sollte es dem Steuerzahler zu denken geben, warum wir Tablets für alle Schulen kaufen wollen? Und im nächsten Schritt: welche.

Bereits in den 90ern hat die CDU in dem Bereich versagt wie niemand anderes - man erinnere sich an ""Schulen ans Netz"". Betriebe konnten abschriebene Altrechner ohne Entsorgungsgebühren an Schulen karren, die dann mit ""Comal"" ohne jegliche Internanbindung die Zeit eines für das Fach unqualifizierten Mathelehrers raubten.

Die CDU hat noch nie digitale Kompetenz gezeigt und das sieht mir doch jetzt so aus, als würde man Anlauf nehmen soviel Geld wie möglich zu verschwenden!

Tablets zu kaufen ist dumm, weil der Lebenszyklus dieser Technik in keinem Verhältnis zu den Anschaffungskosten liegt. Ein Raspberry-Pi und ein Arduinobrett wären sinnvoller...würden aber vorraussetzen, dass auch neue Lehrerstellen geschaffen würden, die wiederrum Geld kosten, das wiederrum den Landesregierungen dann fehlt weil Bildunspolitik immer Landespolitik ist...übrigens auch nur, weil die CDU sich mehrfach geweigert hat einen allgemeinen Standard zu etablieren...u.a. weil die südlichen extremistischen Bundesländer wie eben Bayern oder BW sich weigertern Religion als Wahlpflichtfach abzuwerten usw...

Kurzum: das Konservative an sich schadet diesem Land und die versprochenen Tablets werden nur einem großen amerikanischen Konzern mit Niedriglöhnen Geld bringen und das, weil die CDU kein eigenes Wahlprogramm hat.

Der Grund warum deutsche Inetnetnutzer vom Niveau weit hinter unseren skandinavischen Nachbarn liegen, ist übrigens CDU Postminister Schwarzschilling gewesen, der meinte Deutschland brauche ein eigenes Internet (BTX/DatexJ) und wer da rein will braucht eine Lizenz der Postbehörde. Freiheit und Verstand sind was anderes.

&gt;
&gt;Jansa, 54, was on charges of giving or receiving bribes for unlawful mediation during the selection and purchase of 135 armored personnel carriers by the government from Finland's Patria.
&gt;
&gt;While Jansa was sentenced to two-year imprisonment, two other co-defendants, Ivan Crnkovic, director of Slovenian bearing giant Rotis, and Brigadier General Anton Krkovic, also got 22-month sentences for each for their role in receiving bribes to secure the 278 million-euro (364 million U.S. dollars) contract on eight-wheeled armored personnel carriers with Finish company Patria.

Dunno, it's negative currently. Pretty low, I'd say.

&gt; Could you elaborate on this?

Yes: We do not deviate from the convergence criteria, and we have not devalued our currency (which remains pegged to the Euro).

On the other hand, austerity is only one small part of the way we deal with the crisis. There is a stronger focus on investment.

&gt; According to LSE, the reason your country can borrow at a lower rate than an equally indebted EZ country is because your CB has a lot more credibility than the ECB.

Well, yes, and where does that credibility come from? A super stable economy. It's not just down to the handful of people managing one single bank.

&gt; That's why scandinavian labor is so cheap. right?

It isn't? The point is that you (generally) get what you pay for, whereas corruption adds hidden costs to every transaction. Labour is expensive in Scandinavia, but as an employer you get highly skilled workers, and you don't have to worry as much about social issues like health care, child care, unemployment insurance, etc.

If you're looking for unskilled workers (say, for mindless factory work), it is indeed very expensive to place your factory in Denmark, which is one of the big problems we're currently debating how to solve. People need jobs, and not everyone can be an academic.

&gt; In any case, I'm resident in Belgium... you know,,, one of those EU countries whose per capita commitment to the EU is larger than that of Germany, but who has to pay the increased risk spreads, only because of German intransigence/EU incompetence.

Belgium is actually doing alright, but I'll have you know that Denmark is contributing even more per capita — the most in the entire union, in fact. :) And we don't even get to participate in €-related decisions.

If Merkel came to town, it would not be this way. Austerity is the only thing they understand. Same goes for Ollie Rehn and ECFIN. 

That is part of the point. You guys still have enough sovereignty to be able to decide this. That's what...for example the debate during the french elections were about when the left said ""growth rather than austerity""

Not being subject to the ECB.

yes, because monetary policy is completely inconsequential. right.

Only because the PM said ""NO AUSTERITY"" directly to Merkel's face. actually the debt/GDP is higher than that of cyprus, or France. It's also higher than  Portugal's was the day that the Germans came to pay them a visit.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; so we can use reasoning to determinate which ideas are worth defending to this extent. 

This assumes a homogenous shared culture. This might be true for the majority of Westerners but we should not forget there are cultures whose values are highly different to our own. These ideas that areworth fighting for will entirely depend on the culture. 

&gt; I'm not talking about extremism, not even about a societal model. I can live in a socialist or a capitalist society, this isn't the point. If the model doesn't suit me, I'll try to rally people to change it. 

In any society if you're rallying people to change the fundemental nature of the system then you are an ""extremist"" by definition. 

&gt; I'm talking about basic rights and freedoms.

This is a very Western viewpoint and one which I share, but that does not inherently make it right. Those rights and freedoms will vary across culture and history. 

&gt; Reality is heartless. 

I know.

&gt; Are you in disagreement with the principle of self-defence?

Of course not, but self-defence and defence of an idea are not necessarily the same thing. 

&gt; How would you react if some people showed up at your door (or your neighbour's) with the clear intent of killing you because you wrote something they didn't like?

This one is possibly more subtle than intended. The ""right"" to speak ones mind is one that I agree with and given a choice I would always err on the side of freedom of speech. 

However, we have seen events where some muslims have protested against the UK army as dead soldiers are brought home and the counter protests by English/British facists. This has led to groups fighting and the genuinely bereaved families suffering much indignity. Whose rights should we protect here? 

If we accept the Muslims have the right to protest against something they see as wrong then we must also accept the right-wing nutjobs have the right to counter that. If we protect the rights of the family to have their loved ones treated with respect then we must accept that freedom of speech has limitations. 

Those limitations are then agreed upon by societal norms which as we know is a fluid and subjective thing.

To go back to your point, how would I react? Well, I might consider what I wrote before writing it. Self-censorship is not brilliant but as you said the reality of life is somewhat different from the abstract idea and if we know that writing something (or drawing cartoons say) is going to lead to a murderous response and the state/society is not going to protect us then I, personally, would proceed with caution. 

I dislike this level of pragmatism and applaud those that do what they do but without self-censorship and legal censorship then if we adopted your approach society would be a lot more brutal. 

&gt; Do you support arresting such people? If lethal force is needed, would you accept its use?

Attempted or actual murder is a crime so yes they should be arrested within the confines of law. Self-defence is an acceptable defence in law so yes if needed I would use it.",0,1370428115,null,0,false,0,cack2y1,t3_1fkttc,t1_cack2y1,t1_cacjnf6,null,1430919584,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,schossel,null,null,"I'm a German real estate agent and go figure it's not always like it seems. I work together with my father and we both have to pay our insurance, German IHK and a lot of other stuff. If a private person puts advertising for a house or an apartment in the local newspaper they pay around 0-5€ depending on the paper. If I put it in there they charge me between 50-100€. You put your house onto an internet plattform they charge you 10€/2 weeks, I pay 2500€/year for the same plattform.
Consider some rural area, we need about 15-30 appointments with potential clients to sell a house, some of them ma ke appointments and don't come -&gt; lost money. You invested about 1,5h of your time and there's a no-show.

Real estate laws differ from younty to county. A house commission is normally 6%, in some countys the seller pays it in full in others it's divided 3% for each party. If you consider that cheap houses are sold also it's sometimes not easy to get even with your costs.

Apartments here have normally a commision of 2-3 month rent which also depends where you are.  A lot of apartments are owned by someone who isn't living nearby. They couldn't rent the apartment out without an agent. The work and prices for advertising an apartment or a house are quite equal and if you believe it or not we would like to earn money too.

Not every real estate agent is bad. It's the same with doctors or lawyers, there are good and bad ones. It's quite often that we save buyers a lot of money because the fee is splitted, in that way we not only work for the seller but also for the buyer. Regarding the past I can tell you that we saved the buyer so much money in about 75% of the cases that he had the commision back and saved a couple grand!

And please don't forget the banks! A lot of people go to their local bank and don't even consider another bank before we tell them. If you buy a house between 100 and 200K there's a lot of money in the ring considering you get a loan from bank A for 3% or bank B for 2,5%. Over 15-20 years you can loose a lot of money. Over the years there were a lot of people where we saved them a lot more money then they paid us commision only because we gave them the right informations and talked to several banks with them.

The renting part in big cities is a lot different and I'm on your side that there are a lot of agents who don't really care because they know there's 1 apartment and 200 possible renters, so they can do whatever they want because someone is renting despite their effort. But this is a city phenomenon because the owner of the apartment is in 90% not living nearby and has to consider an agent. In rural areas this is a lot different because the owner is either living nearby or even in the same house.

Don't consider veryone bad only because there are some black sheep out there like in every other profession!",0,1370428486,null,0,1370429478,0,cack4ll,t3_1fnts4,t1_cack4ll,t1_cac5b8m,null,1430919564,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Modern day tear gas often mainly uses one component to irritate/hurt the victim orthochlorobenzalmalononitrile (CS) or C10H5ClN2, a crystalline powder with a peppery odor (hence our friend the swede here mentioned crystals).

Of course blowing a powder in people's face isn't that effective so a  dispersal agent is used, for example the solvent methylene chloride, which carries the particles through the air. 

Often a number of additional chemicals are also added to serve as heat dispersals to creat an aerosol. Hence it's not always advisable to pick up and throw back the gas canisters with bare hands. They'r hot.

I also found this:

&gt;The dispersal method itself can prove dangerous, however, as illustrated in 2011 when a police tear gas canister fractured the skull of protester and Iraq war veteran Scott Olsen

&gt;CS gas rapidly loses its effectiveness in a given environment -- especially in the open air. To counteract this property, the U.S. Department of Defense has created at least three different CS variants:

&gt;CS1: This variant consists of 95 percent CS and 5 percent silica aerogel (a low-density synthetic material) to prevent CS particles from clustering together.

&gt;CS2: Designed to float on water, resist degradation and boast a longer shelf life, CS2 is 94 percent CS, 5 percent colloidal silica (a material related to silica aerogel) and 1 percent hexamethyldisilizane (a solvent).

&gt;CSX: This liquefiable CS variant consists of 1 percent CS1 and 99 percent trioctylphosphite (a stabilizing agent).

Why vinegar works? I don't know for certain. It's been a few years since I dropped the chemistry BS and went for programming but I think it's some of the acidic compounds that react with/attract the chemicals and thus neutralize the gas. Similary I heard stories of WW2 soldiers ...ehm pissing on a hankerchief (incase they lacked a gasmask) and covering their airways when under a gas attack.

That came out of nowhere. Completely out of nowhere. I responded by saying that I was raised in a traditional family set-up and I'm perfectly normal. Then you come along with your accusation that I'm saying that should be enforced for all people every where. I glibbly dismissed your shitty-ass, unnecessary point and you came back with fucking research you had taken the time to lookup all for the purpose of proving me wrong (for being raised in a traditional setting or some bullshit). Then you get pretty close to the mark by suggesting I might be a troll, and now you're accusing me of a persecution complex because I disagree with you. The gist of your argument has been to berate me for having a different upbringing to your studies and still turn out completely ok, which I shared purely as a counterpoint to the argument that housewives are failures of women and failures for women everywhere. You came out of nowhere, and fallaciously dressed up my backstory as some kind of argument against the merits of feminism? And then you accuse me of a straw man argument?

Fuck yourself. Really. Please. Just fuck right off. How dare you accuse me of such narrowminded bigotry. You completely misunderstood what I was getting at. And if you really think the demonisation of house wives isn't a part of mainstream feminism then you need to go do some research on first and second wave feminism, and maybe read a few lectures and key-notes given by the Dragons and maybe dive into the debate a little bit more. I have made my point abundantly clear: the arguments of mainstream feminism are skewed and undermined by arrogance. Whether is is consciously acknowledged or not, the opposite of progressivism is no longer traditionalism; the opposite of progressivism is considered regressivism. For this reason (they see the choice to be a stay at home mom as regressive), feminists *hate* stay-at-home moms. They *hate* them. Just the other day I was listening to a debate on Radio 4 in which a journalist declared that the life of a housewife is a life of partial house arrest. It's comments like that which are cheap, unfair and irrelevant in a debate about female empowerment, but nonetheless highlight the patronising view many feminists hold of stay-at-home moms. Women are *not* encouraged to choose for themselves, they are encouraged to choose what feminists want them to choose, and that's a career. I'm all for choice, but the only difference is that I don't judge people based on their choices. A housewife isn't always some oppressed victim, as people like you hold. There are those who are there by choice because they just don't feel the need to work, yet their voices are never heard because they are drowned out by vocal critics of their lifestyle choice.

The second is religion, specifically the bible belt in the US. Canada's population is only 2% Baptist whereas the US is roughly 15%-25% Baptist/Evangelical Christian. Those group are overwhelmingly against homosexuality. These two groups are probably the main reasons for the difference you see in the US and Canada.

Considering the efforts towards secularization and westernization that started with Ataturk it gets quite close. The westernisation aside it's main culture could be described as Ottoman which is in itself a continuation of both Greco-Roman and Islamic cultures.

The origins and modernisation of their culture aside. If we base who is part of Europe (in itself it refers to the continent but whatever) only of of culture then why not invite in the Australians, Americans, ect too. After all their culture is very much a derivative of historically recent European culture.

 As much as as authoritarian Islamist governments are prevalent in the Arab nations should we with the reappearance of Nazism parties and groups like the golden dawn count Nazism as a typically European thing? That would be silly wouldn't it....

As far as the backlash on secularization goes, despite what your view on Islam may be you can't deny that a number of eastern European nations haven't properly secularized either or definitely haven't defined it constitutionally unlike Turkey. The fact that there are now huge protests and fights against that deterioration of secular principles should definitely be something we should report on shouldn't it?

And if religion is your big thorn in the eye then I kindly refer you to Bosnia &amp; herzegovina and Albania.

Furthermore there have been talks of Turkey joining the EU something which with current revelations of course can not continue for a significant period but which definitely forms a strong argument for their relevance in r/europe.

Thinks got a little better for a while, as the Omboudswoman said the schools shouldn't force students to confess to a priest in school grounds, and that non-christians could opt-out from Religion classes (as the nature of those classes are 'confession of faith', not ethics and theology).

This is not /r/EU but /r/Europe. However the EU may is of much relevance to /r/europe but we still discuss countries like switzerland and norway. Regardless of your view on whether they should some day be allowed to join. The possibility alone definitely drags em into the picture.

&gt;Turkey isn't a European country.

Has a decent area within continental Europe, a significant population within continental Europe and strongly to Europe connected history and culture. Due to the Greeks, Romans, Balkans and so on.

Your opinion on whether it's a European country is irrelevant when talking about definitions. Consider that Turkey is a transcontinental country just like Russia is.

&gt;Which would imply that they are within Europe's borders although they are not geographically.

How can one be within Europes borders ...but not geographically? Please do not stretch the EU to Europe like some people define the USA as America.

&gt;Russia is not a member of the European Union and the amount of territory within Europe's geographical borders is relatively small compared to the actual size of Russia.

Goddamit please tell me what are you basing your claims on?

- Geography? Well clearly it's within both Europe and Asia! It's a transcontinental nation that straddles more than one continent.

- Culture? Well clearly it's for the majority a European country then. 

- Population? Well 78% of Russia's population is within Europe and not Asia.

- Political situation and Human rights index? Well as explained that has 0,000% to do with it.

Exactly!!!! I never said that a majority of the Spaniards supported it, but *you* said **that bullfighting was not supported at all by the Spaniards and would stop immediately if there were no tourists, not Spaniards would go**. 

How can you say that if 29 % still support it, where 13 % is strongly. If you do not understand it -. *it means that there are Spaniards who support bullfighting around, whereas you said there were none*!. Most likely those people also go to a bullfight now and then. 

&gt;That's because Spanish politicians are bunch of despotic twats that want to force their ideas down everybodies throats. They know better than anyone else. And if someone disagrees with them, the others are worng.

I am sure you know more about that than I do, but to say that every single spanish person is against bullfighting and that it is only depending on tourists is wrong - a sizeable majority still likes it. A minority sure, but a *Spanish* minority, not tourists. 

Personally my Spanish friends tells me it will die away within a generation. The support for it seems to lessen, so I am sure they are right, but it is still allowed at the moment. 

&gt;What they don't realize is that their lack of respect for diversity is what eventually will break the country. 

Yes, both Catalonia and Basque wants to be independent as far as I know. In the end I guess they will have to vote about it, just like Scotland.  It will be interesting to see the outcome, that is for sure.

true,Staxxy,YAFrance,France,"La guerre civile en Syrie « rébellion », « révolution », est souvent présentée a tort par les médias comme une guerre « contre l'islamisme », « pour la démocratie », « pour la liberté », on dit que c'est une guerre « humanitaire », qui doit être menée par les puissances impérialistes en partie a cause d'un usage d'armes chimiques qui n'a jamais été prouvé, mais souvent brandit.


Dans une révolution, il est capital de se mettre en connaissance des factions les plus importantes. Quelles sont les factions de la « révolution » syrienne ? D'un côté, il y a le gouvernement syrien, aidé par la Russie. De l'autre, il y a les milices armées du front Al-Nusra, islamique. Ce front est armé par les monarchies islamistes du golfe, comme le Qatar, l'Arabie Saoudite, le Bahrein, le Koweit, ces mêmes pays qui avaient fait tomber le dirigeant laïc Saddam Hussein. A ces alliés s'ajoutent la Turquie, qui a fait installer de l'artillerie a ses frontières syrienne, et dont le ministère des affaires étrangères milite pour une intervention en Syrie. La Turquie, membre de l'OTAN, est une alliée économique et militaire des Etats Unis, de la France et du Royaume-Uni. Enfin, il y a Israel.


Toutes ces puissances arment ou ont armé l'opposition islamique bourgeoise de Al-Nusra. Certaines puissances comme Israel ou la Turquie ont même mené des interventions sur le territoire Syrien. On se rappelle de l'attaque d'Israel sur un dépôt d'arme syrien qui tue trente victimes militaires.


Quels sont les arguments en faveur de la guerre avancé par les interventionnistes ?


L'argument chimique, etayé dans l'article du 20minutes, présente la guerre en syrie comme une ""guerre sale"", a laquelle il faudrait mettre fin en aidant les ""rebelles"" a renverser le régime.


Déconstruisons l'argument chimique, pour le besoin de cet article. Je me suis rendu compte de l'impossibilité de condenser en un seul post toutes les ripostes a la propagande pro-guerre qui s'est étalée sur ces trois dernières années de troubles en Syrie, on se contentera de mon opinion sur le volet chimique ! (OP will not *completely* deliver)


Si je puis me permettre, utilisont [cet article du monde](http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2013/06/05/la-france-confirme-deux-cas-d-utilisation-de-gaz-sarin-en-syrie_3424378_3210.html) pour réfuter la propagande qui tourne autour de la guerre.


Peu avant que l’Union européenne ne se prononce pour la levée de l’embargo sur les livraisons d’armes à l’opposition en Syrie, Le Monde a publié une série d’articles assurant que le régime syrien utilisait des armes chimiques contre l’opposition. 
En publiant ces articles, Le Monde participe à une campagne de manipulation de pièces à conviction, dirigé contre le régime syrien du président Bachar Assad. Le but assumé des articles du Monde, préparés avec le concours de l’Etat et dénués de toute preuve concluante, est d’encourager les dirigeants des puissances impérialistes à accuser la Syrie d’utiliser des armes chimiques.
La décision du Monde de lancer de pareilles accusations, qui ont été à maintes reprises démasquées comme étant sans fondement, est sinistre et politiquement criminelle. Il est évident qu’en les publiant, le journal savait qu’il fournissait un prétexte non seulement pour la levée de l’embargo, mais pour une guerre. Le président américain Barack Obama, soutenu par les gouvernements britannique et français, a déclaré que l’utilisation d’armes chimiques par le régime d'Assad franchirait une « ligne rouge » provoquant une attaque par Washington.
Le Monde fonde son éditorial sur le reportage du journaliste Jean-Philippe Rémy et du photographe Laurent Van der Stockt. Selon Le Monde, ils ont séjourné pendant deux mois clandestinement en Syrie, avec l’opposition près de Damas. Le Monde ne dit rien sur comment ils ont organisé un pareil séjour, ni sur le caractère des agences militaires ou de renseignement en Europe qui les ont mis en contact avec l’opposition en Syrie. 

Dans un éditorial, intitulé « Exiger la vérité sur les armes chimiques », le Monde s’enthousiasme de la spécificité des accusations qu’ils portent : « Ce qu'ils rapportent ne provient ni de vidéos affichées sur Internet par l'opposition syrienne ni de récits de réfugiés, sources habituelles des témoignages sur des attaques chimiques en Syrie ces derniers mois. Pour la première fois, des assauts chimiques sont décrits par des journalistes occidentaux, témoins directs des événements ». 
Cependant, Le Monde reconnait lui-même n’avoir aucune preuve matérielle pour étayer ses accusations explosives, écrivant : « Le Monde ne détient pas la preuve irréfutable d'un recours à des armes chimiques en Syrie ».

true,Staxxy,YAFrance,France,"C’est dire que les témoignages de Rémy et de Van der Stockt, tirés d’expériences et d’interviews auprès de milices d’opposition syriennes, dont les propos se sont souvent révélés faux, n’ont aucune valeur réelle. Les arguments échafaudés par Le Monde pour en tirer la conclusion que Damas utilise des armes chimiques ont tous un caractère biaisé ou malhonnête. 


Dans l’article « Guerre chimique en Syrie - Sur le front de Damas », Rémy affirme : « Un jour d'attaque chimique sur une zone du front de Jobar, le 13 avril, le photographe du Monde a vu les combattants qui font la guerre dans ces maisons en ruine commencer à tousser, puis mettre leur masque à gaz, sans hâte apparente, mais en réalité déjà exposés. Des hommes s'accroupissent, suffoquent, vomissent ». 
Ceci ne constitue pas la preuve d’un recours à des armes chimiques en Syrie, car ces symptômes ressemblent à ceux que provoqueraient une exposition à du gaz lacrymogène. Pour tenter de convaincre le lecteur que le gaz en question était en fait une arme chimique toxique, l’article ajoute : « La gravité des cas, leur multiplication, la tactique d’emploi de telles armes montrent qu’il ne s’agit pas de simples gaz lacrymogènes utilisés sur les fronts, mais de produits d’une autre classe, bien plus toxiques ». 
Cette argumentation est absurde : le simple fait d’utiliser de larges quantités de gaz ne démontre pas en soi qu’il ne soit pas du gaz lacrymogène. Les forces de l’ordre en France et ailleurs répandent du gaz lacrymogène en grande quantité sur des manifestants ; Le Monde n’a pas pour l’heure proposé des frappes aériennes sur la police française pour stopper la guerre chimique qu’ils mènent contre la population française. 
En fait, l’article ne démontre pas que les gaz qui auraient été utilisés sur le front de Damas aient été hautement toxiques. Le journaliste du Monde ne cite aucune mort provoquée par ces gaz—malgré le fait que, selon lui, seule une « poignée » de masques à gaz a été distribuée aux combattants de l’opposition autour de Damas. Le fait que ces derniers mettent leur masque à gaz « sans hâte » suggère d’ailleurs qu’ils ne craignent pas d’effets mortels. 


La procédure qu’envisage l’éditorial du Monde pour déterminer si ses journalistes ont réellement assisté à l’usage d’armes chimiques contre l’opposition est parodique. Le Monde prétend détenir des échantillons « prélevés sur place par des médecins syriens auprès de victimes d'intoxications par des gaz toxiques utilisés lors de combats. Le seul centre scientifique certifié en France pour procéder à des analyses relevant du ministère de la Défense, ces échantillons ont été remis aux autorités françaises, qui se sont engagées à remettre au Monde l’intégralité des résultats de cette étude ». 
Le Monde a ainsi récolté des matériels fournis par le personnel de l’opposition, comptant laisser à l’armée française le soin de se prononcer sur leur contenu. Une pareille méthode, qui ne jette aucun regard critique sur ses propres sources, va à l’encontre de principes fondamentaux de déontologie journalistique. 
Des sections de l’opposition liées à Al Qaïda détiennent des armes chimiques, et l’Etat français comme Al Qaïda cherchent tous deux à faire monter la pression sur la Syrie. Pourtant, Le Monde ne propose ni une vérification indépendante des échantillons fournis par l’opposition, ni d’examen de leur origine ou du travail scientifique de l’armée française. 


Le journal s’offre sciemment en tant que plateforme médiatique pour les manipulations les plus diverses, par des forces criminelles ou par des officines gouvernementales, qui pourraient provoquer une guerre. 
Le Monde évite d’évoquer un fait d’une importance critique pour évaluer les reportages de ses journalistes : les déclarations de l’ONU qui les réfutent. Rémy et Van der Stockt ont enquêté sur l’emploi d’armes chimiques par le régime syrien pendant le mois d’avril. Or, Carla Del Ponte, qui siège dans une commission d’enquête pour les Nations Unies, était chargée d’enquêter sur les armes chimiques en Syrie, et ce sur la même période. Elle a tiré des conclusions diamétralement opposées à celles du Monde. 
Le 5 mai, Carla Del Ponte avait déclaré à la BBC : « Nous avons rassemblé des témoignages qui laissent penser que des armes chimiques ont été utilisées, en particulier du gaz de combat. Ce qui a émergé de notre enquête c'est que cela a été utilisé par les opposants, par les rebelles. Nous n'avons aucune, absolument aucune indication que le gouvernement, les autorités du gouvernement syrien, aient utilisé des armes chimiques. »
Employant des tactiques déloyales pour donner plus de poids à ses accusations, Le Monde cite à l’appui les allégations déjà discréditées par l’ONU, sans citer l’intervention de del Ponte. 
Dans l’article « Guerre chimique en Syrie », Rémy écrit: « Plusieurs pays : les Etats-Unis, la Turquie et Israël, ont déclaré posséder des éléments matériels indiquant l'utilisation d'armes de ce type, mais n'ont pas communiqué la nature exacte de leurs preuves, ni décidé si, comme l'avait promis le président Obama en août 2012, le recours à de telles armes par le pouvoir de Damas constituerait le franchissement d'une ‘ligne rouge’ susceptible d'entraîner une intervention étrangère en Syrie contre le régime ».


Le silence de Washington, Ankara, et Tel Aviv sur les commentaires de del Ponte est la démonstration la plus éloquente que les accusations du Monde sont infondées. Si ces pays-là n'ont pas apporté les preuves jusqu’à présent quant à l’emploi d’arme chimique par Assad, c’est qu’ils n’en ont tout simplement pas. 
Le Monde, quant à lui, continue sa propagande pro-guerre. Son éditorial se termine en réclamant que les gouvernements des pays de l’OTAN apportent davantage d’accusations contre Assad : « Il est urgent que les responsables occidentaux énoncent clairement ce qu’ils savent du chimique en Syrie. Qu’ils cessent de tergiverser sur la ‘ligne rouge.’ Ils doivent sortir de l’ambiguïté. Avant qu’il ne soit trop tard ». 
Ce commentaire ne laisse aucune ambiguïté sur la position du comité de rédaction du Monde. Ils veulent que la campagne de provocations contre la Syrie reprenne de plus belle, et que l’OTAN prépare des chefs d’accusation contre Assad propres à provoquer une guerre. Si la guerre se déclenchait sans l’aval du Conseil de sécurité de l’ONU, où la Russie et la Chine ont déjà apporté leur véto à d’autres mesures belliqueuses contre la Syrie, l’intervention serait, de surcroit, illégale selon le droit international. 
Le caractère criminel d’une pareille intervention, menée avec comme alliés des islamistes d’extrême-droite liés à Al Qaïda, visant à d’étendre l’emprise des puissances impérialistes sur l’ensemble des ressources stratégiques et pétrolières du Moyen-Orient, ne fait aucun doute. Si elle entraînait une intervention directe de l’OTAN en Syrie, elle se solderait par des pertes comparables à celles infligées par l’occupation américaine de l’Irak, qui a fait plus d’un million de morts. Ceci ne compte pas le fait qu’une guerre en Syrie en provoquerait vraisemblablement une autre au Liban, voire avec l’Iran ou même la Russie. 


L’appel à la guerre contre la Syrie marque une étape importante dans la putréfaction de l’élite dirigeante française. Toute une couche sociale, les dirigeants de la presse et des milieux de la « gauche » petite-bourgeoise historiquement proche du Monde, se met au service des plus basses manœuvres géostratégiques de l’Etat. 
En publiant des allégations infondées sur d’éventuelles armes de destruction massive pour justifier la guerre américaine en Irak, il y a une décennie, la reporter Judith Miller du New York Times s’était durablement discréditée. Suite à l’opprobre provoqué par son rôle de propagandiste mensongère pour une guerre sanglante et criminelle, Miller a dû abandonner le Times et le métier de journaliste. Elle a ensuite siégé au Council of Foreign Relations, une boîte à idées pour le Pentagone et les services de renseignement américains. 
En reprenant les méthodes de Miller contre la Syrie, dans une situation internationale même plus explosive, le comité de rédaction du « journal de référence » de la presse française s’est abaissé au même niveau de criminalité politique.",0,1370439027,null,0,1370441627,0,cacm2gw,t3_1fntgw,t1_cacm2gw,t1_caclwr5,null,1430918648,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

Yes, the USA is also not an [""optimum currency area""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area), and it does have inter-state competition on tax and regulatory policies. However, we have several advantages that help us avoid the problem of ""Germany is fine and Spain is fucked"" (a technical economics term).

* Our federal government is [over twice the size of our state and local governments.](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jbs ""Graph as percentage of potential GDP, red line is federal government""). Furthermore, much state spending is funded by grants by the federal government. Some of this spending is related to economic conditions (unemployment insurance, anti-poverty programs), so there's some automatic redistribution from rich states to poor states. (Ironically, the poor states tend to vote for a smaller federal government.)

* Language and cultural barriers are much lower, so if things get really bad people can move from one state to another. (Of course, people still prefer to live near ""home."")

* A central bank that does a better (though not perfect) job targeting aggregate statistics for the whole area. For example, if nation-wide inflation is low, but inflation is high in California, the bank does not tighten monetary policy. I think the ECB is trying to make sure that no individual country has high inflation when it seems like it should instead be targeting the whole euro zone.

* A central bank with a ""dual mandate"" to balance stable prices *and* full employment. They haven't been perfect on this (as the seem to care more about inflation), but they're at least trying to come up with a reasonable balance. As I understand it, the ECB is not officially allowed to consider whether unemployment is high or low, only targeting inflation.",0,1370440872,null,0,false,0,cacmlmc,t3_1fpqa2,t1_cacmlmc,t1_cacmbdm,null,1430918398,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

Please, if anyone is openly hostile to you because of your origins, don't hesitate to call them out on their racism. Especially in small communities it can evolve to a horrible form of mobbing, where a few people start to give you shit and if they don't face consequences, others join in. 

I'd suggest getting in touch with more open-minded people or groups in the area. Dealing with idiots is much easier if you have friends on your side.

En cela, les troubles en Syrie ne peuvent être comparés aux autres luttes révolutionnaires qui elle jouissent ou ont jouit d'un soutien populaire, a savoir la Révolution Française, la révolution socialiste d'octobre 1917, la lutte des communistes au Népal et des Naxalites en Inde en ce moment même.

Even I (white, native, family in Germany for a few centuries) get shitty looks in small towns sometimes (because they still see me as foreign). So the combination doesn't work well. This is not an excuse for racism, though. I'd say you should call that fucker out but it probably doesn't make much sense if you start shouting at him in your native language (English?) since he might not speak it anyway.

I'd highly suggest that you get out of the small town. It's really not pleasant to be there if you are obviously foreign (depending on how rural you are, a different German accent is enough to be seen as a foreigner) and people don't like that.

We don't have many Black People in Germany but the ones I talked to were pretty happy and haven't had much racist experiences (that's anecdotal, obviously). If you like living in a small town, try something between big cities. There are plenty of small towns in west Germany an hour away from big cities (by train). People work in big cities, study there, go to school, go there to party and so on. It's basically city people in a small town.

true,darps,,Schwob,"Some of the bigger artists do, because thanks to their relevance, they get their fair share of the cake and promote GEMA in the media, but this is not what GEMA is supposed to do. It's supposed to redistribute income from sales of the big labels down to the small artists who can't make a living because they're not popular enough, but this is not what happens. Small artists get near to nothing from GEMA, which doesn't matter to them because they aren't heard from the public. Of course the big names won't ramble against the actions of an institution that would take away a significant amount of their sales if it was doing its job properly.

By the way, piracy doesn't actually hurt the industry, and especially for smaller bands, it's quite the opposite, i.e. a great way to promote their music. Guess why tons of bands put their music for free on thepiratebay or similar filesharing sites or offer them on bandcamp for whatever the user is willing to pay (with ""nothing"" often being an option). I have yet to hear of a single band who hasn't profited from making their music publicly accessible before they were popular enough to be recognized from the big labels.

Due to its restrictive regulations, it also makes a lot of events involving public screening/covering/karaoke simply impossible. This hurts both the artists and the consumers, which can be seen in effect in the case of YouTube. If GEMA would implement a modern, flexible taxing system which could be applied to streaming on big scales, GEMA and the artists would earn money and the users could listen to the music. Instead, GEMA demands fees based on old pre-internet regulations which can not be applied to videos with millions of watchers. Their best offer to YouTube so far was 0,1 cent per view. Do you think YouTube/Google earn enough to pay up to half a million per video just to GEMA? This is ridiculously unrealistic, yet they refuse to be reformed by the slightest.

Last but not least, GEMA itself sucks up a lot of money due to its huge administration structure (129 100 000 € or 16,8% of their total revenue in 2012 [0]), all money being taken away from artists without being redistributed.

Not true. Consider a model in which the government approves a couple of currencies without forcing merchants to accept more than one. One requirement for the acceptance of a currency could be to allow the government some control of it. Then again, I do have to think more about if that is necessary. If some currency by design leads to lower unemployment or something people will naturally gravitate to that currency.

I fully support the idea of an independent, publicly funded information and news network. But I'm not sure, if I should pay ~230€ per year for this and have some 2-6 other channels that I am not interested in at all.

I also like the idea of paying a fixed fee and in return being allowed to share my favourite media with my friends. But when 25% of the cost of the media is this fee, but sharing anything is still illegal, it seems strange.

Of course artists should be compensated for their work and making this easier with a large collective organization is in theory a great idea. But when more and more people share their creations freely and openly under a Creative Commons or similar license, the umbrella assumption that every piece of media is licensed by the GEMA is just incorrect.

On the global scale, the internet makes an overhaul of the licensing schemes overdue. Having media released at different times under different conditions depending on the country will only drive piracy.

On a national scale, I believe the system could benefit from more democracy and a more modern approach. While I like the idea of a [Kulturflatrate](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulturflatrate), I would be happy with a reduced fee for public news channels and some kind of subscription / voting scheme for stuff like ""Verbotene Liebe"" and all the various talk shows.

true,cheio,ANAR,Zensiert,"Frauen werden benachtiligt → Personaler stellen bevorzugt Männer ein → Frauen verdienen weniger → Frauen werden benachteiligt.

Aus dem Blogpost:
&gt; bei gleicher Qualifikation und gleichem Beruf immernoch 8 Prozent weniger verdienen, was zwar nicht mehr so spektakulär klingt, aber dafür nur noch eine Erklärung übrig lässt: Frauen verdienen weniger, weil sie Frauen sind.

Die Zahlen kommen vom statistischen Bundesamt. [Hier](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Publikationen/Thematisch/VerdiensteArbeitskosten/Verdienstunterschiede/VerdienstunterschiedeMannFrau5621001069004.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) ist die Studie, die de Autor offenbar, obwohl er mit Zahlen daraus herumzaubert, nicht gelesen hat. Denn da steht mehrfach, daß die (mittlerweile) 7 % nicht herangezogen werden können, um daraus Diskriminierung abzuleiten. Das erste Mal auf Seite 10, mit Begründung, nochmal auf Seite 55.

&gt; Evidenz dafür, dass Frauen im akademischen Bereich systematisch als weniger qualifiziert wahrgenommen werden, liefert eine Studie, 

Also die Studie sieht ganz interessant aus, die ist zwar alleine nicht so viel wert, n=127 ist nicht besonders viel, können Fehler drin sein, etc.... Aber immerhin doppelblind, randomisiert, etc. Sowas hat vielleicht etwas mehr Beweiskraft. Die Studie müßte man jetzt wiederholen, in verschiedenen Ländern, unter verschiedenen Situationen, verschiedene Bereiche, dann eine Metastudie anfertigen etc. Dazu müßte man mal ein bißchen Geld in die Hand nehmen, und dann hätte man in einem Jahr oder so eine wissenschaftliche Basis, anhand der man sich überlegen kann, wie weiter vorzugehen ist.

Der Autor macht hier aber zwei Fehler: er mag auf ein Problem gestoßen sein, aber wie immer beschaut er es nicht näher, fragt überhaupt nicht erst danach, warum die Probanden so entschieden haben, sondern weiß gleich schon intuitiv, daß der Grund eine Diskriminierung sein muß, die — und das ist der zweite Fehler— nur mit Gegendiskiminerung bekämpft werden kann. Das Grudgesetz spricht hier eine deutliche Sprache: Wenn jemand eine Diskriminierung findet, muß die abgebaut werden. Es sagt nicht, daß, wenn irgendwo eine Diskriminierung auftaucht, das mit einer anderen Diskriminierung „ausgeglichen“ werden darf nach dem Prinzip „Minus mal Minus gibt Plus“.

I can't respond to your Radio 4 anecdote because I don't know the context, but I can see how that journalist's comment could have come up. There's a lot of social pressure on women to be in the home and it can be a prison, but you are wrong in taking that to mean that feminists don't agree with women freely making the choice to stay at home. You have to understand that feminism is both a system of thought and a movement actively fighting for change and there is conflict between those. Obviously everyone has the right to choose how they live, but we recognize that there are societal pressures in place that won't be overcome except through concrete action.

I've tried to stop, but if it's something you've grown up doing, and no one has told you it's rude or wrong, then it's hard to change something so ingrained.

I think with the bakery situation that you mentioned that the workers were 100% more concerned with you not speaking German than with the colour of your skin. I would be extremely surprised if it was the other way around. The worker was probably just like ""oh shit I have to speak in English.""

Spain is looking for his wallet on the floor, asking everybody 'have you seen my wallet', Scotland has it behind his back and is laughing and Wales is whispering 'just give it to him its unfair.'

Latvia and Poland run out of drinks and start demanding more from everybody else, saying 'we're only here for a good time, sharing is caring'. England left his cigarettes on the table unattended and they each dip into his packet taking some. Germany gives Poland a beer and says FRANCE, GIVE LATVIA A BEER.. OR SOME OF THAT CHEESE YOU BROUGHT, so France does without questioning a more alpha male, and also liking Germany telling him what to do in kind of a sexual way.

England laughs and goes to talk to Finland about how such a good looking girl can be so strong, she's shy, doesnt really talk much and seems to be constantly assessing the conversation, care free England finds that an intelligent outlook and cute, and Finland likes Englands easy going confident attitude, so they get on well.

Ireland can't stand the sexual tension and gropes Portugals arse.

Germany sucker pushes Scotland in the side of the head, so England pulls Germany towards him, headbutting him to the ground, Finland puts the boot in.

Scotland vollys France in the face, then walks home with Italy and Portugal. France helps Germany recover from unconsciousness, giving him the kiss of life. Germany in his dizziness and intoxicated state kisses back, trying to decide if he likes it or not. This is the best night of Frances life.

Poland and Latvia find some loose change that fell out of Germanies pockets, and an ecstasy tablet where England was sitting. They split the tablet and the change talking about 'bros for life'.

I did. The thing you don't understand is that the public sector is currently severely understaffed and we don't need your ""genius"" proposals, based on Bild anecdotes, about imposing more cuts to appease the market gods or whatever. They imposed a ""1 hire for every 10 retirements"" policy for 3 years already. The recent layoffs are only meant to make a point to the civil servants to keep them in line. This is the sort of policies that are imposed on Greece. 

&gt; But probably your uncle has some well paid job in the government that is done by ten other buraucrats too.

Please spare me the personal attacks based on preposterous national stereotypes and on an undeserving feeling of superiority. You don't know how hard-working I or anyone else in my family are, so just drop it.

No, that's not a lie and the troika is welcome to coerce the Greek government to investigate the tax evaders and not the journalist who publicised it. Too bad that neither the troika or the imposed policies are doing that. In fact, they're doing the opposite: in the recent parliament elections they threatened the Greek population to vote for the same guys ""or else"". The same guys that are in bed with these tax evaders. The international press was choke full of articles boiling down ""we know they're corrupt but Greeks should vote for these guys again or else something very bad is going to happen to them"".

I tell stories of how hard I try to befriend the Germans in my classes to no avail. I start off with saying hello and we chat a bit. Then class starts. I think, *Maybe we can walk toward the train station together and chat and it'll be the start of getting to know each other!* But then class ends and I have to talk to the prof for twenty seconds and the person, who obviously is not thinking, ""I think I'll befriend the foreign girl!"" skedaddles.

*No problem,* I think. *Maybe we can sit together next class, since we sort of know each other now."" Then next class comes and they slip in late and take a seat by the door. *Oh.* They notice me and smile or wave, and I think, *Oh, well, that was friendly! Maybe I can catch up when we're leaving and say hi!* But they pack up and leave five minutes before the end of class. *Okay, next time!* I think, but next time they don't come to class.

The next class they attend, they sit in the empty spot beside me and we chat and I get excited, thinking this is the start to maybe becoming friends -- or at the very least, having a friendly person to sit with and talk to. But no, they then drop the class.

Last person I tried to befriend in my class had a Referat the week after we first met and he *still* didn't show up to that class.

I was accused of causing my children to have a crap relationship with me, and I rebutted it. You then came in waving studies around your head saying how wrong I was. I don't really understand why you did that, but hey-ho. I at no point suggested that policy should resemble the 1800s and women should shut up and sit down. I am in no way suggesting that my father was a patriarchal monster and my mother was a victim. I simply made the counter argument to the thread's liberal circlejerking that traditional set ups can work, and work for many people. My own experience and those of my extended family (and the vast majority of my friends) all fly in the face of your research and we have prospered more than the average individual. I fully support laws for more affordable childcare, I am enthusiastic about the reforms to maternity and paternity leave in Britain in the coming years (especially as I am currently in the process of having kids), and I wish all parents everywhere every success in their efforts to raise their children, and, yes, I think laws should be made to make it as easy as possible for all people, not just conservatives.

That said, I have made it abundantly clear that the housewife is seen as the enemy of feminism. If you disagree you can type into Google 'is feminism regressing'. The academic literature argues that it is, and Third Wave Feminism (TWF) is generally regarded as a crapshoot, with everything and anything being defined as feminism. That doesn't mean that they accept housewives. On the contrary, the idea of regression implies the reversion to a previous state, and the increase in conservative perspectives is seen as that previous state. More women choosing to raise their kids, embrace their maternal instincts, 'go natural' with full pain child-birth - all these things are considered by feminist academics and journalists as being restrictive and imprisoning, and they see women who do it as letting the side down. Agency is king is a lovely motto, but the literature (and I know how much you love studies) is squarely against your assertion that feminism embraces the housewife mentality. You are simply wrong.

My point is not that feminism is wrong, only that it is flawed in it's demonisation of certain women. Ironically the wikipedia article on TWF is rather open and embracing of the crapshoot nature of TWF, saying that feminsim is about liberation, and as such it takes on different forms in each generation and between each individual. 'Agency is king'. But if you go into the academic literature this is not what you will find. There is a clear and vivid alienation of women who are giving up their feminist birthright and walking back into the home to raise children. It is there. It is evident. You may disagree, but you are wrong.

&gt; The allegation that Greece had entered the eurozone by falsifying data made headlines in numerous newspapers around the world. Unfortunately, the assertion was also adopted by many politicians in the eurozone and is repeated to this day.

&gt; But the allegation indicates ignorance, not to say hypocrisy. Because even including defence expenditure upon order and not delivery, under the new recording method **the revised state deficit figures in the critical year (1999) became 3.1% of GDP against 2.5% of GDP previously. The precise figure was actually 3.07%, according to Eurostat (AMECO). This deficit is still lower than the equivalent revised deficits of other member states that were assessed on the basis of 1997 statistics, and which formed the first wave of member states that created the euro area in 1999.** The AMECO website shows that many other member states entered the euro area with state deficits that were higher than 3.1% of GDP. But there is little public reference to this fact, even though many of these now manifest similar problems to Greece.

One of these states was France. Guess who raised the matter first: Nicolas Sarkozy. Oh, the irony.

Representative democracy. The people don't make the decisions. They delegate that power to their elected representatives who make decisions on the behalf of the people. Greek government =/= Greek people.

If the Greeks actually had democracy in the style they had it 2300 years ago, then the Greek people would be directly responsible because that style of democracy was direct democracy, which meant that every citizen voted on every single issue (even though citizenship was heavily limited). 

The modern Hellenic Republic (aka Greece) does not have direct democracy. It has representative democracy.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Your arguiment was that Poles did not kill Jews out of antisemitism. I prooved you wrong. Suddenly it doesn't matter anymore.

I never said that Poles never killed Jews out of antisemitism. I said that the Poles never committed genocide, which is an organized attempt to eradicate a group. Isolated massacres are tragedies, but they are *not* genocide. Genocide requires the intent to exterminate and some degree of organization.

&gt; Says an American who probably never set foot on Eurpoean soil and likely got all his wisdom about the subject from History Channel.

I've been to Europe--Auschwitz included--and I love to read history. I'm not a professional historian, but I consider myself more educated than the average layman about history in general and about genocides in particular.

&gt; Hardly genocides. Hell, as a German I didn't even hear about the Namaqua before today - and frankly, neither seems Wikipedia. I think you mean ""Nama"". The Herero and the Nama uprisings were insurrections and bandit attacks against German colonists. POWs were taken and put into camps that were ill-supplied, which lead to preventable deaths.

&gt; The actions of von Trotha were outside of his jurisdiction, not checked with his surperiors and made him shunned in German society. Do not mistake the actions of one man with a planned genocide.

""Namaqua"" is apparently an antiquated word for the Nama people. I learned it as the ""Namaqua and Herero"" genocide in school, so sue me. But there certainly was intent--by von Trotha if not by his superiors, thought that's doubtful--to get rid of the Nama and Herero completely. It wasn't just about ending militant activity by those peoples. As for ""one man:"" von Trotha had subordinates. Thousands of them. They cooperated. The only reason you as a German don't learn about this in school is that so much of your time is occupied by unpacking your more famous genocide later in the century. 

&gt; That is a question to be argued about. On which scale do you think the Holocaust was the biggest genocide of the 20th century? Percentage of targeted group killed? Head counts?
 
Both in objective number of people killed (~6 million) and in percentage of the target group (&gt;30% of world Jewry), the German anti-Jewish genocide is the winner. And that's ignoring the attempted genocide of Roma and, eventually, of Poles and other Slavs.

&gt; Of course, from someone whose people use genocide and genocidal behavior as a national pasttime, I should be not surprised. Everyone needs a black sheep to point at.

Um, could you elucidate a pattern of genocidal behavior for me? Because other than the Native Americans (which was in the 19th century; after that our policy has been arguably more like a kinder form of apartheid than genocide), and *maybe* the Philippines if you *really* stretch, I'm not seeing a pattern.

I wonder if the Greeks will find any irony in the fact that the only reason they were saved from greater catastrophe was because they were part of the eurozone. 

&gt;But having agreed that there were exceptional circumstances that warranted the biggest bailout in the Fund's history, officials were taken aback by the much bigger than expected slump in the Greek economy.

I've actually read [the German paper](http://www.cesruc.org/uploads/soft/130301/1-1303011Z221.pdf) (pdf) mentioned in the FT article. This is the part where you should read a couple of times.

&gt; When exact and true values conform with Benford’s law, replacing these values with fabricated numbers typically results in a deviation from Benford’s law. However, the fabrication of numbers may not necessarily be an act of deliberate manipulation; even rounding causes a deviation from Benford’s law. **Thus, a deviation from the Benford distribution does not provide conclusive proof of manipulation, just as conformity does not prove cleanliness of the data.** Rather, non-conformity should be seen as a signal indicating data that need closer inspection and further testing. Benford’s law can thus be used in addition to existing control mechanisms as a first step to check possibly falsified or manipulated data.

&gt; To the best of our knowledge, Benford’s law has been used twice (!!!) so far to check the quality of macroeconomic data. Nye and Moul (2007) show that growth rates of the gross domestic product generate datasets which conform well with Benford’s law. Contrary to Nye and Moul, Gonzales-Garcia and Pastor (2009) argue that nonconformity with Benford’s law should not be qualified as a reliable sign of poor quality of macroeconomic data, but could also be based on marked structural shifts in the dataset.

ELI5: we have a method which has only been used 2 times for this purpose, and where the most recent research before the German paper says ""meh"".

The authors state in their conclusion:

&gt; In the case of Greece, the suspicion of manipulating data has officially been confirmed by the European Commission.

That's nice. The authors are seeking justification for using a problematic method, in an event that didn't happen. The Commission *never* provided such an official ""confirmation"". Find one and I'm doubling by bet.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; That is part of the point. You guys still have enough sovereignty to be able to decide this. That's what...for example the debate during the french elections were about when the left said ""growth rather than austerity""

You're confusing a number of issues. First of all, Merkel is a Conservative, so of course she is advocating austerity — it's the only thing they understand. I don't believe it is or should be the only tool in the toolbox.

However, it's absolute pure bullshit that we are weathering the crisis because of some amount of ""sovereignty"". Let me repeat what I've stated several times: No financial policy of the Danish government is unimplementable by €Z-countries. We are bound by the same rules as the €Z, *by convention*, because we're a tiny ass country that wants to keep trading with our big and numerous neighbours, so we follow along even if we don't technically have to.

&gt; yes, because monetary policy is completely inconsequential. right.

Monetary policy is not decided by a single institution.

&gt; I don't get why you actually think that this is somehow about corruption, rather than institutional competence of the EU. You know full well that all the more corrupt EU countries (those in the east) are not in crisis at the moment (because of the competence of the EBRD)...and yet you persist, in spite of the evidence.

""Corruption"" is a long range of issues, not just direct bribes (which by the way are *still* prevalent in Spain, Italy and Greece). Rather, the main issue for the south is lack of bureaucratic ability — bluntly put, it takes forever to do anything, including starting a business, hiring employees, but also *firing* employees (also because of lack of stronger social security nets).",0,1370485341,null,0,false,0,cad2pt9,t3_1ff11u,t1_cad2pt9,t1_cack0ie,null,1430910609,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Congratulations, you failed utterly.

&gt;If a person makes a decision that is not in line with your beliefs or ideals, that person lacks agency? 

Where did I state that? I have no beliefs at all how anyone should behave within legal boundaries. What I do have is a ton of social science that tells me that humans in general are pressured into certain behaviour by their environment, and I am criticising the particular design of the environment many women find themselves in (in fact, I extend this to males as well, but this isn't neccessarily part of the current discussion).

This has got nothing to do with restriction of individual choices, rather than the question why the default is how it is in our society. 

&gt;What's with the boobs and crashinga a modelling show then?

I don't know. I'd suggest you ask them. Naked skin doesn't equal bad or opressed.

So it's 50% of young people who want to work, not 50% of youth.

""However, it should be remembered that a large share of people between these ages are outside the labour market (since many youths are studying full time and thus are not available for work), which explains why youth unemployment rates are generally higher than overall unemployment rates, or those of other age groups.""

Yes, sure, but when he did with the gay marriage debate, you can see the sort of stuff it unleashed, and that was from a fringe.

Seriously, if his retirement reform started now, there would be hell to pay. And from both sides of the spectrum. I can just see both Mélenchon and Marine Le Pen throwing verbal tomatoes in huge rallies already, and let's not even mention Copé who jumps on anything the president does to put himself in the media as disagreeing entirely, to the point of being blatantly opportunistic and even hypocritical.

The French leaders are isolated in palaces, but the street is always there with the threat of electoral guillotine. Many a prime minister has been unseated through the power of the manif'.

It seems to me that this article ignores the power of public opinion and the street. It holds the cojones of the leaders, whoever they are, in its tight fist.
