Start work 8-9 then take a break when it is hottest during the day to take a rest, eat and just relax then when you get back to work around 3-4 you can work until 8-9 with no problems.

Most of the people I know in Greece who close down their business during siesta hours is because it is the slowest time of business in the day and also they can rest which allows them to work later into the night during the busiest hours of foot traffic. 

So instead of the traditional 9-5 business hours, many small businesses go 9-12/1 few hours break then start around 3/4 and go into 8/9.

Exchange of products and services in a free market, yes, but also an exchange of workforce in a free market. I dislike this policy of let's try to ""ride the EU train for free"" and not allow free movement while still profiting from other EU freedoms. If the UK doesn't want something that comes with the EU it should make a referendum about staying or not in the EU now not start blackmailing the EU with some future referendum that will happen but until then let's not respect some EU principles.

Young people can't get that experience because companies choose to hire the more experienced candidate. So they're stuck. Education is fine but most jobs need more than a diploma or a degree.

* Une semaine plus tard, une fille de 11 ans brandit une peau de banane lors d'une visite de Christiane Taubira à Angers, en criant ""C'est pour qui la banane ? C'est pour la guenon !"". Elle agit ainsi au sein d'une petit rassemblement de la Manif pour tous, dans l'indifférence des adultes qui l'entourent (soit que ça ne les choque pas... soit qu'ils ne l'entendent pas). Les parents de la jeune mineure affirment ne pas comprendre le pourquoi de ces insultes, avançant que leur enfant ""est née aux Antilles"", et a vécu ""la moitié de sa vie en Outre-mer et en Afrique"". Ils avancent un début d'explication: la fameuse affaire de la candidate FN et de son photo-montage, ""repris en boucle par les médias"".

* Par la suite, le quotidien d'extrême-droite *Minute* sort une Une au titre douteux: *Maligne comme un singe, Taubira a la banane*. Le but ? Vendre plus de papier et s'inscrire dans la ligne du journal.

Bref, ce petit rappel des faits, même si vous les connaissez probablement déjà, est là pour poser une question simple: cette ""montée du racisme"" est-elle vraiment à prendre au sérieux ?

Je ne veux pas minimiser les faits: ces trois affaires sont pénalement répréhensibles et inadmissibles. Mais justement, la direction du FN tout comme les parents de la jeune fille considèrent ces insultes à la Garde des Sceaux comme inacceptables.

Et à partir de cela, on lance des marches antiracistes contre des hommes de paille, pour faire diversion par rapport à une politique gouvernementale qui déçoit cruellement la plupart des Français.

En ce moment sort au cinéma *La Marche*, reconstitution de la marche des Beurs de 1983. Le film a l'air d'avoir pas mal de défauts (et reçoit beaucoup de critiques négatives, à droite comme à gauche), mais il a le mérite de remettre en mémoire un épisode de l'histoire de la Vème République où un gouvernement récupère un mouvement antiraciste, à la fois sincère et naïf, pour en faire une structure politique (SOS Racisme) capable de faire diversion au moment où s'amorcent la rigueur et les premières déconvenues mitterrandiennes.    

Il faut croire que l'histoire se répète, à quelques variables près...

A part ça, je suis impressionné par une Taubira qui a réussi à être à la fois victimisée et héroïsée. Tous les ministres ne peuvent pas se payer le même luxe d'être portés aux nues sans qu'il soit aucunement tenu compte de la politique qu'ils mènent.

In a dutch place, moment you answer the question with English, dutch over. They immediately speak to you in English. So to me that's really the difference, and this happened to us a few times.

Cela ne date pas d'hier. Le PS, malgré ses rodomontades, est bien obligé de travailler en bonne intelligence avec les entreprises qui subissent la crise de la même façon ( enfin je suppose que tu parles des méchants patrons qui exploitent le peuple quand tu dis libéral ). 

Le problème du PS, c'est le décalage entre les solutions qu'il propose et le monde en 2013. Je crois qu'il est bloqué dans les années 80 comme la plupart de la politique française. Quand on voit la mesure phare du projet éducatif made in Hollande qui est l'embauche de milliers de profs dont les notes aux concours sont nullissimes, on se dit vraiment qu'il y a pire que de l'incompétence à l'oeuvre, c'est un sabotage total et volontaire de l'avenir de notre pays. 

Le PS et l'UMP sont les deux revers d'une même médaille. Ils représentent une France pour qui l'épanouissement, c'est d'épouser une héritière. Travailler, c'est indigne, et l'avenir, c'est de gérer la fortune existante.

* L'oggetto in questione è venduto da una azienda seria al 100%, per cui non vi è la minima possibilità che essa riceva i soldi e se la rida, senza inviare nulla, o che provi una qualche truffa.
* La spedizione verrà effettuata tramite pacco UPS tracciabile, non con corriere P.I.
* La transazione PostePay avviene tramite il sistema Visa.

Ripeto la domanda :)

Visa-Postepay, al momento del cambio euro-dollaro, applicano una commissione, che voi sappiate?

EDIT: finalmente ho trovato una risposta...sulla pagina wikipedia di Postepay! :D
Per gli acquisti all'estero, Postepay usa il tasso di cambio Visa, senza alcun costo di commissione. 

Il che significa che, dovendo acquistare dall'estero da una azienda seria e non da un privato, P.Pay è consigliabile più di PayPal in termini di risparmio economico, in quanto il tasso di cambio Visa è più simile a quello reale di quello Paypal.",0,1385888179,null,0,1385888619,0,cdqu2ra,t3_1rsg09,t1_cdqu2ra,t3_1rsg09,null,1428442687,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Ecco la parte interessante del link:
*Il caso. La truffa è avvenuta in occasione di un normale acquisto su un portale di e-commerce. L’utente ha usato la propria Postepay per il pagamento, ma al momento dell’addebito delle somme gli sono stati sottratti 1000 euro in più dalla carta. Il consumatore ha dunque sporto reclamo a Poste italiane per far valere le proprie ragioni, come previsto in certi casi, ma l’azienda ha negato qualsiasi responsabilità. Tramite una nota, a firma di un generico ‘responsabile’, i funzionari delle Poste si schermivano affermando che il rimborso non era dovuto, visti i requisiti di affidabilità della piattaforma e considerato che i codici di utilizzo della carta erano rimasti segreti: «Da verifiche effettuate – rispondeva l’ufficio reclami - è emerso che il sito viene identificato come attendibile in quanto l’esercente partecipa ai ‘protocolli 3D Secure’».*

*Si tratta di un meccanismo di sicurezza sviluppato da Visa e MasterCard, che accerta la paternità delle transazioni su web, richiedendo una password prima dell’acquisto. L’esistenza di questo tipo di controlli, a dire di Poste italiane, è sufficiente a rendere ingiustificata «qualsiasi iniziativa nei confronti della banca che gestisce gli incassi». Soprattutto alla luce del fatto che le credenziali di utilizzo della carta, note solo al proprietario che è tenuto a custodirle, erano state utilizzate in modo corretto.*

Unfortunately for you, taking the exam requires you to be able to speak german, since you will have to have indepth knowledge about the german law. Though there might be a chance of you having your degree recognised, which is possible under the law (yet comes with some disadvantages as far as I know). But the details are beyond my expertise, so I'd advise you to [check with the governing body on this one, which is the ""Wirtschaftsprüferkammer"" (WPK)](http://www.wpk.de/english/third_countries/registration.asp).

As to your question regarding **masters degrees in accounting.** To the best of my knowledge, there's only a combination of Accounting/Finance/Taxation master programmes out there, which are all located with the Business departements of the universities. So I'd advise you to check the rankings of german universities regarding their business programmes. Please keep in mind, that most coursework is done on a full-time basis (some even require attendance and keep logs, but this is rare AFAIK). So you should inquire about ""Teilzeit-Studium"" or ""Teilzeit-Master"" (part time studying/master), which is also called ""Duales Masterstudium"" (dual master studies) or ""berufsbegleitendes Studium/Master"".(job accompanying study/master).

Concerning the legal issues when **applying for a visa,** [please contact the nearest german embassy.](http://www.germany.info/) You might also want to keep in mind, that under the visa waiver regimen, you are free to enter Germany without a visa and stay for up to 90 days during which you can apply for the necessary paperwork as well. Please note, that this does not entail a working permit!

A-H was much wealthier and educated than its neighbors (save Germany) and was on its way to democratization.

It doesn't have to be the right course, just a lesser evil. I've never been to a brothel so I've not had the experience you have (and I never wish to visit a brothel) but that type of shit will still exist if prostitution is made illegal.

I think the one thing the legality of prostitution and brothels does is allow discussion. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I can't help but think that when prostitution is made illegal, it is the illegality of it that dominates any discussion, which shrouds any constructive discussion on what could be done to improve the situation of prostitute because the illegality is treated as the solution itself.


The brothel you walked into could have been a bad one, or perhaps it was no different than your average brothel. But I think improving the conditions of brothels and those who work in them isn't going to be done if made illegal, it will just hide the issue. 

As I said, I've never been to a brothel and perhaps if I did the experience would change my view in the way it changed yours. However, what I do know is that despite brothels being illegal where I am (and despite me having no interest in them), I know where two are just because taxi drivers aren't fucking shy about it. And it wouldn't take long to find more. With such apparent ease of access, I just don't see making it illegal as a viable answer.

They need to be worth it to a company.

Compare it to soccer. Yes, for 100,000 euro's you could buy a decent player, but he's not going to be that impressive. However, for 15,000,000 you could buy a star, a player that could make the difference between winning or not winning the championship that year. The fact that the guy mowing the soccer field makes 30,000 while the guys playing on it make millions is very odd, but it comes down to talent. Anyone with some instructions and some guidance can mow a soccer field, while the people that can play soccer as well as the professionals are incredibly rare. We wouldn't pay thousands for diamonds if you could find them in your backyard.

As a worker, you are a commodity. As long as the demand is high enough, your worth will increase. The demand for the very talented is incredibly high. People tend to see bankers for example as just people sitting on their asses, but they have often worked long and hard. My dad for example has quite a decent job in the financial world, but he has been working at least 70 hours a week for the past 25 years.

All it does is to put the problem in the corner, where it will remain and where people will suffer in silence.

But even so, I don't think the EU will completely shaft the UK, the option of being an EEA member will probably still be there, but what's the point of quitting the EU to be an EEA member? EEA member nations have to implement EU legislation with no say in it.

true,Loki-L,GERM,Germany,"It should be noted that the law from 2002 did not in fact make prostitution legal. It was mostly legal before that.

What did change was that contracts that involved sex as a service were not considered legally binding before that. With the law prostitutes got most of the same legal  protections as any other job. Another change that happened at the same time was that pimping was legal as long as it served to provide a proper workplace.

The idea behind that law was to take prostitution out of the legal twilight it was in and give prostitutes legal protections, like being able to call the police or even go to court if something goes wrong without having to fear being punished themselves. It was designed to keep women from being exploited as easily.

It might be argued that it achieved that goal at least with moderate success.

Unfortunately nowadays there are a lot of women being exploited that still can appeal to the system because they are in a different grey legal area. They are the victims of human trafficking and have to fear being deported back home if they go to the police to complain about mistreatment.

In my opinion the system should always seek to fix things so that there are as few disenfranchised people as possible. Having lots of people around who can't appeal to the system just breads more crime, violence and abuse.

Originally the alhondiga was a market for fish but now they have remodeled the whole interior. It covers most of the cultural needs of the city: cinema, huge library, all kinds of events if you visit it the right time (usually on erekends there are typical vasque dances and music or some other  thing).

Yes because there is a bigger market if you legalize prostitution. It is logical. Likewise, insurance fraud is strongly encouraged if you legalize having an insurance.

&gt;There's no ideal solution, but I personally think that having less prostitues who work under worse conditions than before is preferrable to having many prostitutes that work here against their will.

There is an ideal solution, one which we have in Denmark: Pimping is illegal. And instead of going after the prostitutes, you go after the actual criminals.

Protesters in Ukraine have stormed the Kiev city council building as they oppose the government's decision not to sign a deal on closer EU ties.

Police are massing outside the building but they have yet to move in.

It comes as thousands of people have been marching to the capital's Independence Square defying a ban.

Protesters want the resignation of the government and new elections. President Viktor Yanukovych says Russian pressure was behind his decision not to sign.

The BBC's David Stern in the Ukrainian capital reports from outside the city council head office that protesters broke windows to get inside the building.

Ambulances were pulling up outside the building and there was an acrid smell of smoke, he says.

The protests started more than a week ago after President Yanukovych suspended preparations for signing an EU association agreement that would have opened borders to goods and set the stage for an easing of travel restrictions.

Mr Yanukovych argued that Ukraine could not afford to sacrifice trade with Russia, which opposed the deal.

Jailed opposition leader and ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko earlier urged Ukrainians ""not to leave the authorities' actions unanswered"".

She has been on hunger strike since Monday over the failure to sign the EU agreement.

For example, in Switzerland (specifically, Geneva) they [created a union for sex workers](http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/Geneva_prostitutes_band_together.html?cid=33519714) which affords additional rights to them as actual employees of a trade.

The Old Town (*Casco Viejo*) is a must-see. Fantastic traditional Basque-city architecture and dozens of bars and restaurants of very high quality. Any bar you enter, you'll see [pintxos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pintxo), which are like small appetizers but that can be eaten at any time, not just before a bigger meal. The Basque pintxos are very famous, and while the ones from Bilbao aren't considered as good as the ones from Donostia-San Sebastian (which is debatable), I can assure you they will be wonderfully good. Also in the Casco Viejo you'll see lots of restaurants, all of them of very high quality. I'd recommend you to eat there at least once. 

The Casco Viejo is a very commercial and touristic area, so you'll find souvenir shops and many others you may want to visit. In the Casco Viejo you may want to see the [city's cathedral](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Bilbao_-_Catedral_de_Santiago_51.JPG/240px-Bilbao_-_Catedral_de_Santiago_51.JPG), the [medieval San Anton Church](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Bilbao_-_San_Anton_33.jpg), the [Plaza Nueva](http://www.absolutbilbao.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/La-Plaza-Nueva-de-Bilbao.jpg) and some other medieval structures and bridges in the area. Important museums include the [Museum of Sacrum Art](http://www.eleizmuseoa.com/castellano/informacion.htm) and the very famous [Basque Museum of Bilbao](http://www.euskal-museoa.org/es/hasiera) if you're interested in Basque culture. 

The Casco Viejo is known for its nightlife as well, so be sure to check that up if you're interested. Many bars and pubs in the area.

Close to the old town is the [Arriaga Theater](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Teatro_Arriaga_exterior_2.jpg), the Arenal park and the [City Hall](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sK0UbIZkiN0/TtxtHnkgv7I/AAAAAAAAAVk/QsP-bL3FXjc/s1600/ayuntamiento.jpg).

Other must-see places are the Abando and Abandoibarra zones, in the latter one you'll see the [Guggenheim Museum](http://images.guggenheim-bilbao.es/src/uploads/2012/05/ees012.jpeg) with all its well-known attractions, the walk along the river (very nice) and the [Euskalduna Palace](http://www.reservatutaxi.com/galeria/euskalduna.jpg). Close from there you should also check up the [Bellas Artes Museum](http://www.museobilbao.com/), which is quite underrated and, in opinion of some, better than the Guggenheim. Just near the museum is the [Doña Casilda Park](http://info.elcorreo.com/joyas-bizkaia/fotos/627_parque-dona-casilda.JPG). In all the area you'll find restaurants, bars and shops. 

Some other cool places include the [Alhóndiga](http://www.hotelvistaalegre.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/324/files/galeria-localizaciones/fachada-ho-eva-zubero.jpg) and the [Campos Elíseos Theater](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4055/4454974805_7538573d4e.jpg). All the Abando zone has loads of things to do and see.

All these things I mentioned can be reached by walking or taking the tram, but if you don't mind taking the subway and going a bit further, you should really check up the [Puente Colgante](http://www.puente-colgante.com/index.php/es/) and all the Getxo area in general, the waterfront is really cool and a must-see in the area (plus bars and restaurants available). If you want to see the industrial past of the city, you can take the Puente Colgante to the other side of the river and check up the neighborhoods of Portugalete and Santurtzi, but they're not very touristic. 

Finally, if you don't mind leaving the city, there are amazing locations in less than a 30-minute ride, like Gernika, Lekeitio and all those coastal towns. ",0,1385907827,null,0,false,0,cdqwzuo,t3_1ru0sd,t1_cdqwzuo,t3_1ru0sd,null,1428441325,9,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,9

Cyprus

&gt; Do you prefer the sign before or after?

After, but I always prefer the three letter abbreviations (xx.xxEUR/GBP/JPY etc) over the symbols. Those are always after the amount. 

&gt; How were prices written in your original non-Euro currency?

Cypriot Pound (£/CY£/CYP) was written before the amount. 

&gt; If your country has accepted Euro, are the signs usually written before or after? Or is it half and half?

We have Euro nowadays. It mostly appears before the amount, like with the CYP, but now you often see it after the amount too. I don't think that everyone does it out of choice, like I do. It's probably computer-generated, with computers using Greece's locale settings, which place it after the amount. For example, [this e-shop uses both - before the amount in their banners, after the amount in the listings (that are probably computer generated fields)](http://i.imgur.com/n2xcdSf.png)

Franz Ferdinand had plans to reorganise the country so that the Slavs would have a bigger say in it, and later the emperor Karl had similar plans.

According to [Franz Ferdinand plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Greater_austria_ethnic.svg) Budapest would still loose control over Transylvania, Croatia, most of Slovakia, most of Vojvodina. It was seen as partition of their land and that's the reason why Budapest was so staunchly against it. 

The fact remains that the government of the Kingdom of Hungary was doing everything it could to magyarize as much of its population as it could. The government in Wien was much more tolerant towards Czech and Slovenian minorities. The Czechs had their own schools from kindergarten to university and cultural institutions. The germanization of Czech population was much more subtle than [magyarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magyarization) of Slovak, German, Romanian, Croatian, Serb, Ruthene and Ukranian minorities. [Slovak minority formed 10% of the population yet it did not have a single high school](http://i.imgur.com/JFwwvSY.jpg). Slovaks formed 10% of population, yet they had only 7 MPs out of 420(iirc) total.

So, if a democratic A-H were to prevail, the Kingdom of Hungary would either had to be a highly magyarized one or it would be a butchered one - as envisioned by Franz Ferdinand. Very similar to today's status quo.  The historical evidence points out that cultural assimilation was the path which Budapest had taken in 1867 and remained on it till the end in 1918.

No. Human trafficking gets fought because it directly harms people and hence must be a crime. You've admitted that prostitution itself is not the problem here, but controlling it would be used to target another problem.

Now as the morality is blurred, we should look at results. And those don't look promising.

&gt; In Europe those organised gangs have the biggest markets for prostitutes and sex slaves. I am convinced that if there's less demand in Europe they'll force less women into prostitution because it just wouldn't be worth it anymore.

New Year: This holiday is already pretty secular in nature (or rather the celebration a day before) and most people probably use the free day to cure their hangovers.

Easter: Kids search for stuff. Yeah, it’s religious, but I think lots of non-religious people do that part of it, too. Visiting relatives was also a big deal in my family (just like on Christmas) but my family is mostly religious and I’m not sure whether non-religious people do that, too.

And honestly, that’s about it when it comes to holidays with strong established traditions about what to do in Germany. Religious people go to church on other religious holidays (or not, depending on how religious they are), and for everyone else it’s just a day off, like a vacation day. The only difference is that shops are closed.

One possible exception (at least in East Germany) is [Father’s Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%27s_Day#Germany). It’s a really big deal there (and completely secular, even though it’s technically on a religious holiday), but was never a big deal where I’m originally from (Bavaria).

Another exception is Labor Day, traditionally a day for demonstrations (protests, and in some cities even riots) for labor rights. Though most people are in no way affected by this. For them it’s just a day off like any other.

This is true enough. In fact, the majority of Romanians in Transylvania, even with the magyarization attempts, did not wish to unite with Romania initially. Austria-Hungary was quite strong economically and the differences between the standards of living of Romanians from Transylvania and Romanians from the Kingdom were quite stark.

It was only after the assassination of Franz Fredinand that the preeminent Romanian politicians in Transylvania moved towards a more unionist rhetoric, as is the case of Iuliu Maniu and Alexandru Vaida for example. Even so, the Union only happened after it was clear that any attempt at reconciliation between the differing ethnicities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was beyond the realm of possibility. 

The means by which Transylvania was annexed to the Old Kingdom were also quite dubious. One of the stipulations of the Alba Iulia Proclamation guaranteed the rights of the other nationalities and laid out the plan by which the Union was to take place. In essence, what Transylvanian politicians wanted was autonomy for Transylvania within the Romanian state. Initially, these demands were respected and Romania turned into a de-facto federal state until 1923 when King Fredinand promulgated the new Constitution and centralised the administration, ending the region's special status in spite of protests by numerous Transylvanian politicians

For Romanians outside Romania, Union with it was an idea that only gained traction after the start of WW1. When this period is taught in Romanians schools, no mention is made of the role the Old Kingdom had in eliminating the previously agreed upon special statuses of both Bessarabia and Transylvania or how ""national unity"" was not a goal all Romanians aspired to. What is being taught are half truths and outright lies. ",0,1385911795,null,0,false,0,cdqxwbn,t3_1rtqxt,t1_cdqxwbn,t1_cdqva8e,null,1428440887,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

I first learned about the oppression of the Slovaks from a history book for children when I was 9-10 years old so yes, I think people learn about it. It's sad that it happened but I don't see why the Slovaks of today still have to be dicks because of it. 

Edit: maybe I misunderstood you. Regarding why the Hungarians did magyarization in the first place, it's because it was the 19th century and every country did it.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"Thank you very much for the link. Just to clarify for people reading here:

Marriage in Croatia is *already* defined as between a man and a woman only under family law, so in effect this referendum accomplishes nothing except to make same sex marriage super duper illegal in the constitution, which is absolutely absurd. This referendum was allowed under a law passed a few years ago that said that if any petition receives the signatures of a certain percentage of the population, then it can go to a public referendum and be passed into law. The reason for the law then was to allow a vote on EU membership, but the current government sort of forgot to close that law back up, and now the insanely cryptofascist right-wing political party, HDZ, along with their BFF the Catholic Church® have taken it upon themselves to start canvassing in churches and right-wing political groups to get a series of referenda on a variety of social issues. Nevermind that the country is sinking under unemployment, a stupidly bloated bureaucracy that puts the Soviet Union to shame, and a host of other issues. The next referendum for which they're collecting signatures right now is to ban the use of the cyrillic alphabet. This is in particular reference to the city of Vukovar, which has a very large ethnic Serb population (Serbian and Croatian are basically the same language, but Serbian is written in cyrillic and Croatian with the Latin alphabet). The constitution already guarantees and protects minority language rights, which presumably includes Serbian, so I don't see how the referendum is even *remotely* constitutional. It will have to go before the Constitutional Court before it's approved, and they *should* throw it out immediately, but when they were asked about the constitutionality of the gay marriage referendum happening today, their simple response was ""that's not our jurisdiction"". Then whose fucking jurisdiction is it!? You're the Constitutional Court, deciding on the constitutionality of things that will change the constitution - it's literally your only job. So whose jurisdiction is it? In all honesty, the Vatican. The court is incredibly political and full of useless people.

So yes, the referendum will probably pass (even though it should have been declared unconstitutional weeks ago - also, any coincidence that today is Sunday? Get a sermon in church about how to go vote against the sinners and then pile out the doors and into the polling stations), but the government's already taking steps to rectify the situation: they're preparing a civil partnership bill that will grant same-sex couples almost all of the same legal rights as heterosexual couples, although probably not adoption. Also, I've been told that they're working overtime to try and repeal this referendum law lest they be buried under Catholic church petitions trying to make everything but Jesus illegal. Make no mistake about it - this isn't about the church (who have funded and largely organised the entire process) trying to right some sort of moral wrong in their eyes - gay marriage is already illegal - it's about them trying to flex their political muscles and remind people in Zagreb that the church is still a major political player in a supposedly secular country.

So whatever the result is, don't worry too much. Steps are being taken to try and offer a good alternative. Unless the ruling SDP party gets kicked out at the next election and the HDZ come in, in which case God help us all.

NOTE: I mean no political shitstirring by bringing up the Vukovar situation. I'm not a Serb so I'm not really bothered either way; I mention it simply as an example of how these right-wing referenda will continue. Plus, the fact that it's anti-constitutional is blatantly self-evident to anyone who knows the Croatian constitution at all. On top of that, who gives a fuck? Croatia's got much bigger problems to worry about than what alphabet someone's writing in or who gets to say they're married to whom.",0,1385912658,null,0,false,0,cdqy4tu,t3_1rtwm7,t1_cdqy4tu,t1_cdqvnaf,null,1428440777,26,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,26

Ecco, con questo hai dimostrato di non sapere praticamente niente del mondo delle gare. Chiunque sia appassionato di questo mondo, sa perfettamente che quello che fanno i piloti in pista lo si può fare SOLO sulla pista. Si, va bene, gli appassionati di gare spesso vedono la strada come una pista, ma la differenza tra un appassionato ed un coglione è che l'appassionato conosce i suoi limiti, il coglione rischia di far mare a se stesso ed agli altri pur di fare il figo. *PS: In questa categoria può rientrare il ragazzino con lo scooter truccato, ma può essere anche un adulto idiota a bordo della sua auto...*

I ragazzetti che truccano i motorini non lo fanno per imitare i piloti professionisti, lo fanno perché sono appassionati di meccanica o semplicemente perché vogliono un mezzo veloce per tirarsela con gli amici; buona parte di quella categoria di ragazzetti non sanno nemmeno cosa sia il mondo delle gare motociclistiche.

Uscire dall' euro nello stesso modo, se davvero (e io non lo credo) ""la sovranità appartiene al popolo"" non si dovrebbe fare.

Anche perchè - siamo onesti - in qualunque modo si decida di andare avanti, euro o non euro, non c'è nessuna strada percorribile che non passi per l' annullamento di tutto o parte del debito pubblico. Il ""rifinanziamento"" non è e non è mai stata un opzione, con l' IMU che porta 10 miliardi nelle casse dello stato e il debito pubblico che cresce di 50 miliardi all' anno.

Quello che la gente si ostina a non voler vedere è che l' Italia, dal punto di vista economico, è già morta. Bisogna avere il coraggio di guardare i fatti e ripartire da zero.

One of the places we were focussing on a lot was Bijlmermeer, which is a relatively depressed area in south-east Amsterdam that is nowadays mainly associated with crime and immigrants. We were staying at a hotel right near the Rijksmuseum and a group of us went into the hotel bar.

We started up a casual chat with the guy working the bar about Bijlmermeer and mentioned that we were impressed with the new stadium they built there. We asked whether or not he'd been there for any concerts, and his reply was simply: ""Nah I wouldn't go there, that place is full of blacks.""

Oddly enough, just that afternoon we'd been speaking to a city councillor in Bijlmermeer and he had used somewhat similar language referring to some of the new vocational and trade programmes they were launching to raise economic prospects in the area; he was talking a lot about how these programmes would help the blacks, and how the blacks would have better economic opportunities and be able to 'make something of themselves'. I know he meant it somewhat altruistically but it came off as, well... extremely racist.

The final place we went was a new development on reclaimed land called Almere. Back in the '70s when Almere was first being built, loads of white people fled the council housing in Bijlmermeer to escape waves of immigrants moving in. The city councillor in Almere even openly acknowledged this fact - she specifically used the term 'white flight' to describe the settlement patterns. 

Overall, I'd say the Dutch people I met were all very friendly and not unlike people in the UK, but they had absolutely zero reservations about saying whatever the fuck crazy idea suddenly shot across their mind with no censorship. And I'm certain it's not just some linguistic nuance that's missing in translation, because these people all spoke English virtually as good as natives to know that that's not how people in Anglophone countries normally converse.

However gay people will most probably not reproduce so out of a cold, calculated purely economic perspective gay marriage will only do harm to the state.

A union between two parties has to be seen as beneficial by both. Some people consider the national argument (""we are the same people therefore we should unite"") as bringing no benefit to us (even on the long run), but they see costs (the price of union). Even those who made the first union, back in the early 20th century thought that on the long run a union would bring tangible benefits which outweigh the short-term costs. Materialistic calculations underpin all ideological stances.

From what other point of view should Romanians look at the issue?

The average salary is probably a more representative quantity, the mean in Moldova being ca. $300, comparable to Ukraine and roughly half of Romania's average of $600.

In any case, I view Moldova's economic under-performance as symptomatic of more profound underlying problems. Sure Moldova may not have had the luckiest start as an independent country and its unsettled separatist conflict is certainly not great for business. Nevertheless, even with these hindrances, it is hard to deny that Moldova's poverty is due more to egregious mismanagement and absurdly widespread corruption. These are problems that cannot simply be wiped away with capital investments, but will require much more profound changes, including a change in the mentality of the people. 

I agree with you that Moldova's best chance lies is in European integration, but perhaps more in the process itself than in the outcome.

Che luoghi comuni?

&gt; ma vedo 2 paragrafi che, per quanto riguarda la questione euro, non c'entrano niente, e 1 con cui dici in sostanza ""sì ma è importante per l'immagine del popolo che si riappropria..."".

La questione euro è tanto politica quanto economica. Io dico molto più politica che economica.

&gt; Ecco, converrai con me che sono argomentazioni un po'... deboli?

Quali argomentazioni sono deboli? Quella del ""è inutile pensare alla 'ricapitalizzazione', basta guardare i numeri di quello che entra e quello che esce che sono diversi di ordini di grandezza""? O quella degli ""economisti"" che hanno raccontato tutto e il contrario di tutto - stranamente sempre sostenenti quello che faceva comodo a chi le scelte politiche doveva farle andare giù alla gente? Oppure che a fare le cose sottobanco l'unica cosa certa è che si calpesta il concetto di sovranità popolare (sempre sia mai esistito)?

&gt; si è analizzato quello che comporta?

Cosa comporta fare un referendum invece che uscire dall' euro dalla mattina alla sera? I grandi capitali, della scelta ""segreta"" di cui parli tu, sarebbero al corrente almeno 6 mesi prima. Grandi capitali che, basta guardare i numeri, hanno già lasciato l' Italia *en masse* a partire dal 2011. Gli unici capitali che non potrebbero scappare facendo un uscita a sorpresa sono quelli dei piccoli e medi risparmiatori che - strano, non succede mai - la prenderebbero nel deretano.

Ancora una volta - il problema è sì economico ma soprattutto politico. E' un problema di perdita di sovranità a favore di un' entità che è l' europa dei banchieri che rende conto a molti ma certamente non ai popoli che dovrebbe rappresentare.

My mother is generally non-religious and it won't even for a second cross her mind to go to church when we celebrate Christmas here in Munich and relatives come to visit us. However, when we visit the rest of the family in rural Bavaria, she automatically goes to mass with my aunts because she grew up there and this is the standard behaviour on that day in that place carried over from her childhood.

Non-religious people basically view any religious holiday as a day to spend time with their families or, even more profane, a mere day off. At times I really dislike the fact that religion has such a big influence on every-day life, on the other hand I realize that this is only nominal. It would be absolutely futile to try to introduce new secular holidays, so I prefer keeping-but-slowly-de-religious-izing the existing ones. Also because this way we can keep them as social institutions for everyone (bar some state holidays), a common bond if you will.

Also, politically/strategically speaking: it wouldn't pay off for atheists to campaign against them.

Infatti non sostengo assolutamente che questa sia la scelta migliore, anzi. Solo che nel caso in questione Grillo ha formalmente assolutamente ragione, il referendum esiste proprio per scelte del genere (vedi nucleare, finanziamento pubblico, diritti civili...) quindi tutte le critiche cadono di fronte al fatto che in democrazia la scelta finale spetta al popolo, nel bene o nel male. 
Poi in un mondo ideale si discuterebbe prima del voto delle idee a riguardo dei migliori premi nobel per l'economia e si farebbe un'informazione seria e corretta.

Potential yes, but there are some like myself that are constantly vigilant about the EU's ever lasting ambition to expand eastwards into poorer regions for political rather than economic reasons.

It seems most here want the EU to be some kind of great federation (mostly people from Germany, France and former USSR/Eastern bloc). Honestly, that's not what I want nor do I imagine many others. That doesn't make us anti-EU but it certainly pushes us there...

At this point in time it has nothing to do with capitalism or economics but politics. Depending on whether you are pro Western or Pro Russian. 

Ukraine should just be pro Ukraine. 

It's a false sense of belief that the Western sphere of influence = more sovereignty. Look at how many East European (although Britain is the worst offender in all of this) countries are just a bitch to the US, having their soldiers killed everywhere for American and Israeli interests. Look how European countries treat Snowden and go mental and shut down Airspace for the US. It isn't much better than Russia, only different names and a pretence of freedom. Look at how the US basically floods European markets with its crap like McDonalds and how many of its companies suck countries dry and pay zero tax and only pay minimum wage. It isn't much different.

&gt; The landmark survey of more than 5,000 voters in the UK, Germany, France and Poland finds British people far more hostile to the EU and its policies than those in the other EU states

Look [here](http://opinium.co.uk/sites/default/files/opin-inouteurope.pdf) at page 14 and 15. It's better to look at the graphs, but, for example, here are some of the percentages:

* EU membership is a bad thing - UK 42%, France 34%, Germany 17%, Poland 13%.

* EU membership has more benefits than drawbacks - France 16%, UK 19%, Germany 35%, Poland 54%.

Likewise, here are the percentages for people who say EU immigration has a negative impact (out of the appendix):

* UK 64%, France 59%, Germany 42%, Poland 20%.

The most clear-cut outcome of this data is that France and Britain are much more Eurosceptic than Germany, which is more Eurosceptic than Poland. The UK is certainly on the spectrum of general opinion.

Then, they talk about a widening gap, but support for staying within the EU has significantly grown over the last year. Support for leaving is down from 56% to 50%, and support for staying up from 30 to 36%, so the spread is down from -26% to -14%.#

true,timoleon,FRNK,Franken,"&gt;Denn selbst wenn die Menschen sich umstellen, sparen sie dadurch kaum. In den Berechnungen der Studie heißt es, private Haushalte mit einem Verbrauch von bis zu 6.000 Kilowattstunden könnten durch Smart Meter 1,2 bis 1,8 Prozent ihrer Stromkosten sparen. Das wären durchschnittlich 39 Euro im Jahr. Aber einen Verbrauch von 6.000 Kilowattstunden erreichen nur Haushalte mit vier und mehr Personen, die Mehrzahl der Deutschen also würde noch weniger sparen. 

&gt;Insgesamt geht man bei Privathaushalten von 3.500 Kilowattstunden Jahresverbrauch aus. Deutlich weniger als 39 Euro also. 

&gt;[...] Die 80-Prozent-Vorgabe führe ""für den Großteil der Endkunden zu unverhältnismäßig hohen Kostenbelastungen"", weil ""auch Kleinstverbrauchergruppen weit über ihren Systemnutzen involviert und kostenmäßig belastet werden"".

&gt;[...]  Die Zählerbetreiber, heißt es in dem Gutachten, also die Stromanbieter, könnten für eine ""weitergehende Nutzung der Daten durch Dritte"" Geld einnehmen. ""Andere Marktteilnehmer"" könnten damit ""Produkte und Mehrwertdienstleistungen leichter vermarkten"".  

&gt;Weil der Verkauf der Daten auf Widerstand der Verbraucher treffen könnte, solle er aber ""in der Phase der Einführung vermieden werden"". Die Stromkunden sollen also nicht nur für die teuren Zähler zahlen, sie sollen später auch noch ihre persönlichen Daten vermarkten lassen.

&gt;Die Autoren schlagen vor, diese Kosten auf die Kunden umzulegen. Wer einen neuen Zähler bekommt, würde nach diesem Modell 89 Euro im Jahr dafür zahlen.

I looked up the word racist in the oxford dictionary and it says, 

""the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.""

Again, it talks about a characteristic that makes a race inferior or superior to another one. So tell me where in that sentence does it mention that? Or where you believe the statement from the host it mentions that?

The constitutional court might make a fuss if the decided to interpret the spirit of the constitution rather than it's exact text, but they tend to follow the flow of public opinion so again, if the people decide to change their mind (read: the ones opposed die off from old age in significant enough numbers) on this issue so will the law.

The practical situation stays the same. Regardless of the outcome the people need to be convinced that marriage equality is not the end of the world.

On a side note.

En effet toutes les personnes qui se prostituent n'y sont pas forcées par des proxénètes, une minorité revendique leur libre arbitre et ont bien raison de s’agacer qu'on puisse décréter qu'elles sont forcément aliénées.

Cependant la réalité de l'existence d'énormes réseaux mafieux d'exploitation est indéniable. C'est un problème extrêmement complexe. La légalisation de la prostitution comme en Allemagne ou aux Pays-bas ne semble pas avoir apporté l'effet escompté puisque le marché a explosé. Les réseaux esclavagistes n'ont pas disparu, la concurrence a fait augmenter la précarité des travailleurs-ses du sexe et même lorsque ces choix sont auto-déterminés on ne peut pas ignorer que nombre de ces personnes font ce choix de vie en raison de leur précarité sociale. Le choix fait par la Suède, même s'il est critiquable (il n'y a pas de solution idéale), semble avoir fait régresser le marché et modifié les mœurs concernant la marchandisation du corps.

J'ajoute la comparaison avec le don d'organe/ la GPA: même si certaines personnes seraient tout à fait prêtes à marchandiser leur corps contre rétribution financière et avec un objectif altruiste, la société ne doit-elle pas réglementer en ce domaine? Le débat sur la GPA reviendra peut être prochainement, on verra. Mais pour le don d'organe c'est tranché: on interdit... est-ce que beaucoup de personnes en France y voient une atteinte à la liberté?

&gt;2 - La notion de violences faites aux femmes
Je ne pense pas que nous vivons actuellement dans un système de violences institutionnalisées contre un bloc monolithique défini comme ""les femmes"". Il n'y a pas de rapport entre des victimes de viol, des prostituées exploitées par la mafia et une femme de bonne famille qui se fait agressée dans la rue.

Si par ""violences institutionnalisées"" tu entends complot organisé sciemment par les hommes au pouvoir contre l'ensemble des femmes évidemment ce n'est pas le cas, et ce n'est pas ce que prétendent les féministes. 

Il y a en revanche bien un rapport entre les différents faits sociaux que tu évoques puisqu'ils touchent en très grande majorité des femmes. Il y a donc dans la réalité de ces faits une spécificité liée au sexe. Les rôles sociaux attribués à chaque sexe permettent d'expliquer ces phénomènes.

&gt;D'ailleurs, si on commence à essentialiser les violences faites à chacun en fonction du sexe, on se rend compte que c'est évidemment les hommes qui souffrent le plus de ces violences institutionnelles. Qui sont les premières victimes d'agression dans la plupart des pays occidentaux ? Les hommes. Les conscrits en temps de guerre ? Les hommes. Les accidents grave du travail ? Très majoritairement, des hommes.

Oui. Si les prostituées, les victimes de viols, d'agressions sexuelles et de violences conjugales sont en très très grande majorité des femmes, parallèlement d'autres actes font pour victimes principales des hommes. Le féminisme ne dit pas que seules les femmes sont des victimes dans la société, on explique pourquoi elles sont majoritairement victimes de certains actes, qui touchent moins les hommes. Evidemment les hommes sont eux victimes d'autres faits, que l'on explique également par ces codes culturels: le stéréotype de l'homme qui se doit d'être fort, de refouler ses émotions, de nourrir sa famille...(Etre féministe c'est vouloir l'égalité entre les sexes, donc bien évidemment lorsqu'on dénonce les inégalités d'accès à l'emploi dans certains domaines, affectant les femmes, en corollaire on dit aussi que les métiers physiques à plus haut risque ne devraient pas désavantager un sexe plus que l'autre. On regrette la disproportion du nombre de prostituées femmes sans pour autant se satisfaire de celle des hommes dans les armées.)

&gt;3 - les mécanismes de domination sexiste

&gt;La confondatrice d'Osez le féminisme admet qu'il y'a des situations disparates en fonction de la classe sociale et de la couleur de peau, mais grosso modo elle s'inscrit dans un récit de domination systémique des hommes sur les femmes. Que des hommes soient sur-représentés dans la prise de décisions, c'est une évidence (mais le sexe n'est pas forcément le facteur le plus décisif pour faire partie de ces cercles de décideurs). Les hommes ? Bon courage pour prouver ça.

Vous êtes d'accord: elle ne dit pas ""les"" hommes mais ""des"" hommes. Elle ajoute aux inégalités de classe sociale et de couleur, que tu reconnais, des inégalités en fonction du sexe. Il ne s'agit pas de dire que ce dernier facteur est plus ""grave"" que les autres. 


&gt;Ce qui me pose problème, c'est que ce genre de raisonnement est essentialiste et mène à un jeu à somme négative (""c'est eux ou nous""), où homme = oppresseur et femme = victime.


Elle ne parle pas de domination systématique de tous les hommes sur les femmes dans tous les domaines, mais d'un système d'organisation sociale qui pénalise les femmes dans de nombreux domaines, et qui reproduit cet état de fait. Elle ne pointe pas du doigt (tous) les hommes mais le système. Les hommes en sont également victimes, comme dit plus haut.


&gt;Pour moi, ce genre d'analyse est invariablement à côté de la plaque, et c'est ce qui arrive quand on réfléchit en terme de systèmes et de blocs monolithiques plutôt que d'individus et de situations individuelles.

Je pensais avoir compris que tu reconnaissais l'existence d'inégalités pour ce qui concerne la classe sociale et l'origine ethnique, pourquoi en serait-il différent pour le sexe?

true,peggy_olson_draper,null,null,"&gt;Cette vision nie deux choses. 

&gt;D'une part que les rapports homme-femme n'étaient pas fabriqués de toutes pièces par des croyances mais résultaient d'une division logique du travail dans une société pré-industrielle majoritairement agricole. 

Non, les théories féministes reconnaissent tout à fait le rôle de cette organisation sociétale, en plus des ""croyances"" et des rôles sociaux attribués à chaque sexe, pour expliquer l'existence du patriarcat.


&gt;D'autre part, que nous sommes sortis de ce type de société et que la plupart des choix qui conduisent à des différences macro entre hommes et femmes sont des choix individuels qui s'inscrivent souvent en faveur de la femme ( maîtrise de la procréation, rapport à l'autorité plus conciliant qui favorise des études longues, plus d'aversion pour le risque/le danger physique ).

Voir mon commentaire à jeanralph. (T'es tout de même sacrément gonflé de dire que la maîtrise de la procréation est un choix individuel qui bénéficie aux femmes. Cela est arrivé récemment, grâce au combat collectif d'émancipation des femmes).

&gt;Dans le cadre du débat sur cette loi, [...] il y a la question des moyens. Ils n'y sont pas. 

D'accord sur ça.

&gt;Les femmes ? Ce n'est certainement pas en instaurant la pénurie et en créant des cohortes de frustrés qu'on va mettre un terme aux agressions sexuelles. 

Splendide! Là tu nous fait de l'essentialisme: les hommes ne sont pas capables de contrôler leurs pulsions....

&gt;Ce n'est pas non plus leur venir en aide que de valider l'idée que toute relation sexuelle est sale ou une atteinte à leur intégrité physique.

Merde on a fait une loi contre le sexe?! Je pensais qu'il s'agissait du sexe *tariffé*! 

&gt;Ce que cette loi propose d'écrire c'est que l'homme est l'agresseur lors de tout rapport sexuel. Que toute association d'un homme et d'une femme en public est potentiellement en danger d'être interprété de façon négative.

Bonjour encore l'essentialisme: tous les clients sont des hommes, toutes les personnes prostituées sont des femmes, l'homo/bisexualité n'existe pas. Ce n'est pas ce que dit la loi.

Even in the southern and eastern regions 50% supports joining the EU.

October [GfK Ukraine poll](http://www.gfk.ua/public_relations/press/press_articles/011218/index.ua.html) shows three times the support for association agreement with the EU compared to Russia's customs union: [graph](http://i.imgur.com/LdjvEvM)

[September poll](http://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=rus&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=196&amp;page=1) by The Kyiv International Institute of Sociology showed 41% favoring the EU and 35% Russia's Customs Union.

Turkey signed treaty in 70s.

Ukraine in EU would also benefit more democratic approach - another big country, which might be a counterbalance for Germany (Poland and Ukraine combined has got around 90 mln. citizens, Germany 80 mln.).

I have no problem with McDonald's. I have however problem with institutions like Goldman Sachs (but European banks are just the same) and speculative attacks on currencies and countries - this has happened to Poland few years ago, however our economy is very diverse and based on small bussiness, so we've somehow managed. But this kind of speculative attacks should be illegal.

The next thing about Western influences - Poland has been part of the Latin civilization since 966. We've ruled over Ukraine for hundreds of years and during that time spread western values (Ukrainian aristocracy polonized, we've even had polonized-Ukrainian king). Ukraine is not the same as Russia - western values are much more prevalent than one may think, they've been present there for a long time.

true,Delheru,FINL,Finland,"&gt; smoking pot doesn't do any harm, so I don't see the reason why it should be illegal.

Nor does having sex for whatever you like.

&gt; Prostitution on the other hand can be very harmful - there are many prostitutes who are coerced into their profession

And there are people who can be forced in to addiction to drugs which would otherwise be relatively harmless. Most genuine ""slaves"" found in the west do housework rather than prostitution one might add, so should cleaning services be banned as well? Clearly in-house maids are a risk group.

&gt; it can be a dangerous profession and I think only very few would keep doing it if they had any other option

It is an insanely well paying profession, and while sure, people would prefer to do other things **all other things being equal**, I assure you that would apply to practically every investment banker and hedge fund manager out there. It's just that you can make *so much money* if you do things right.

&gt; The only people who profit from prostitution are the pimps and johns, so I don't really understand how so many people here can be in favor of it.

Uh? That's like saying the only people that benefit from investment banking are the people that own investment banks. I assure you investment banking is a terrible goddamn job, but I really don't think you need to pity said investment bankers that much - they knew what they were getting in to *and* the money is fantastic.

If the prostitutes themselves aren't making enough money, why is that a problem with prostitution as a concept? You might as well use Wal-mart to prove that retail is immoral.

&gt; BTW, I am talking about street workers and prostitutes from brothels only, I think it's a very different matter if you're a high-end escort or offer your service on a private basis with no connection to the red-light district

I can tell, yet you seem keen to make blanket rules that apply to both.

The high end escorts serve the market that brings the huge $$$ to the table, meaning that as long as they aren't served, it'll happen illegally if it isn't available legally. So at the very least the high end escorts must be allowed.

But then again here's the problem...

If you're unemployed that you want a X-Box One to keep yourself entertained, how tempting would it be if someone told you that only thing you'd have to do is to give a blowjob? Once you stop associating any emotion to certain sex acts, they surely are among the easiest jobs in the world.

The biggest problems frankly still come from the stigma attached to it. Otherwise maybe some big chain would jump in to the space and they'd basically squeeze the pimps out in no time flat. Except none wants to because they might suffer brand damage elsewhere, mostly because of people like yourself.

So in my opinion we either have to be totally ok with it, or totally against it, and I MUCH prefer to err on the side of accepting things rather than banning them",0,1385924186,null,0,false,0,cdr2f9a,t3_1rttcl,t1_cdr2f9a,t1_cdqzt4q,null,1428438762,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

In realtà aspettavo che venisse tirato fuori l'argomento della democrazia diretta perché proprio poco tempo fa ne parlavo con un professore di costituzionale. Rimarco per un secondo il discorso sulla libertà di stampa, aggiungendo che l'argomentazione può anche essere vista al contrario, sempre meglio evitare di assumere di essere portatori di verità.

Ti concedo eventualmente la possibilità di trattarmi da ignorante perché magari potrei sbagliarmi, nessun problema. Democrazia diretta, se non sbaglio, sta a significare la possibilità di parte di tutti di partecipare al meccanismo dello stato e del governo, perciò vorrei rigirare a te la ""provocazione"" che mi è stata posta: Ma allora chi decide cosa bisogna decidere? Ci dovrà pur essere qualcuno che mette davanti le decisioni. Mi spiego meglio per evitare che la risposta possa essere ""il popolo"", ma ormai è desueto puntare al raggiungimento della cosiddetta utopia, perciò non potrà mai esistere un momento a breve termine in cui l'umanità – figuriamoci gli Italiani – si ritroverà capace di gestirsi da sola dandosi in autonomia le direttive, e quindi sarà ancor meno possibile che il popolo si trovi capace di porre in essere la scatola decisionale che porta a far si che tutti abbiano il diritto di dire la propria, almeno secondo me. Tu come la vedi? Se sono sembrato prolisso e/o in qualche modo offensivo ti prego di scusarmi fin da subito prima ancora di – ammesso che lo meriti – rispondere.

Se l'argomentazione è posta, oltre al lancio del sasso, i downvote sono molto limitati e dati da imbecilli, ma se ti lamenti dei downvote ricevuti per aver scritto in prima battuta ""Italy è veramente un pessimo subreddit di gente che downvota a sproposito"" beh, è un altro paio di maniche, non ti puoi aspettare l'applauso a) perché è abbastanza offensivo per la gente che frequenta la comunità e aiuta a farla crescere per il meglio, b) perché è un mettere le mani avanti in maniera prevenuta.

&gt;As you can see in the 20th century there were many countries that had similar or harsher laws and they survived - I mentioned France from where Hungary copied its own laws.

France was not as multi-ethnic as Hungary. It also didn't exactly survive, it lost most of its colonies in two very bitter wars that shook it to its very core.

Highly unlikely. Austro-Hungary's situation was relatively unique in Europe at the time. It basically had no dominant ethnicity.

Even if it had won the war it would have probably still disintegrated or at the very least reformed itself into an organisation similar to what the Commonwealth is today.

Yep, emigration to the North. At least that's what my government's  [forecast says](http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np813_en.pdf). Most emigrants would be young people; and that will make  the  natural change negative earlier that it was expected.

**Peugeot CEO renounces 29 million pension deal after a big controversy** : Philippe Varin, boss of Peugeot during the last 4 years, was due to receive 310 000 euros each year, which shocks unions, politicians and just ... pretty much all citizens  given the thousands of cuttings and sacrifices he asked his employees cause ""times are hard, we have to be competitive"" and so on.

HOWEVER, despite previous cases, followed each time by the promise of a law to prevent that, guess what... Hollande didn't even mention that possibilty.

**France sends more troops to the Central African Republic**

**Parliament debates the bill on prostitution**: the bill abolishes the previous law that prohibited soliciting, now clients will be fined (1,500 euros). So it's a system similar to the swedish one, and opposed to germany's take on the issue. (No solution is perfect in this very complex problem, it has been largely debated during the past weeks). The vote takes place I think wednesday.

**SAS resistance hero and French 'Father of the pill' dies**: Lucien Neuwirth, the Gaullist politician responsible for the 1967 legalisation of the contraceptive pill in France, died this week. During the war he escaped death because the bullet that would have killed him struck a coin in his pocket. 


**Baby loup case: A French court has upheld the controversial sacking of a childcare worker who wore a headscarf to work**: Yep... this is a five year old case. it's still not over as the woman will appeal the ruling again (this is the last time she can do that, then she'll have to go to the European Court, if I understood this right).


**Education Minister launches a plan against bullying in schools**

**Debate on self defense reopens as a jeweller kills the man who came to rob him**: a similar case occurred in september and started a crazy debate, with millions of people liking a facebook page in support of the jeweller.

**Mother of infant found dead on the beach more than a week ago identified**: a baby girl was found on a beach, deceased. Camera footage enabled to find images of a woman with her previously but she was only identified some 10 days later.

* C#: foreach(datatype varName in collection)
* Obj-C: for (datatype varName in collection)
* PHP: foreach (collection as varName) or foreach (collection as key =&gt; value) for keyed arrays

Oui, donc le patriarcat conçu comme complot sexiste contre la femme n'existe pas. Notamment aujourd'hui dans une société de service où à qualifications égales la femme est à temps partiel avec des allocs et l'homme au chômage ou en prison.  

&gt; (T'es tout de même sacrément gonflé de dire que la maîtrise de la procréation est un choix individuel qui bénéficie aux femmes. Cela est arrivé récemment, grâce au combat collectif d'émancipation des femmes)

Non, la maîtrise de la procréation, même avant l'invention de la pillule qui l'a rendue facile et quasiment sans risque, a toujours principalement été une décision de la femme. Entre les faiseuses d'anges et les diverses plantes qui favorisaient les fausses couches, 80% de l'origine du mythe de la sorcière, par exemple, est celle de femmes ayant les connaissances médicinales pour faire des avortements. 

&gt;Splendide! Là tu nous fait de l'essentialisme: les hommes ne sont pas capables de contrôler leurs pulsions.... Georgette développe mieux que je ne le ferais ce qui est VRAIMENT GRAVE dans cette idée.

Non, je ne fais pas d'essentialisme. Et je ne dis pas que les hommes ne sont pas capables de contrôler leurs pulsions. Certains hommes le sont. Et en augmentant les barrières pour avoir une relation sexuelle consentie, il y a des chances que certains s'y prennent autrement. Comme le déficit du ratio hommes/femmes en Inde favorise nécessairement une culture du viol puisqu'il y est d'autant plus difficile d'y obtenir des partenaires. 

&gt;Merde on a fait une loi contre le sexe?! Je pensais qu'il s'agissait du sexe tariffé! 

On a fait une loi puritaine, oui. La concupiscence le stupre, tout ça.. 

&gt;Bonjour encore l'essentialisme: tous les clients sont des hommes, toutes les personnes prostituées sont des femmes, l'homo/bisexualité n'existe pas. Ce n'est pas ce que dit la loi.

Qui porte la loi ? La ministre du Droit des Homo/bisexuels ? Ok? 

&gt;Elle a un nom.

Elle a aussi un prénom suffisamment distinctif qui se prête bien à l'expression. Encore un haro sur le langage qui voudrait que parce que c'est une femme tout le monde l'appelle par son prénom. Elle est où la vérité là dedans ? Est-ce qu'on appelle la Reine d'Angleterre Elisabeth parce que c'est une femme ? Donc je résume, le mal ce sont les hommes, les hommes sont partout, le mal est partout. 

&gt;Si pour toi chercher à permettre plus d'égalité c'est castrateur alors c'est que tu te définis par ton sexe, ton rôle viril dans la société...

Non, je me définis par mes choix, par mes envies, par mon individualité. Effectivement assez peu comme un méchant oppresseur de la femme.

&gt;Il ne s'agit pas d'empêcher les pères de travailler mais de permettre à ceux qui le souhaitent de prendre leur part dans l'éducation de leurs enfants, afin que la répartition soit plus équitable, ce qui est bénéfique pour chacun des parents, leurs enfants et la société.

Ce n'est pas l'esprit de la loi. L'esprit de la loi est de remédier à une disparité des salaires. Pas de permettre aux pères d'être des pères.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; There were no confirmed reports about the whereabouts of Mr Yanukovich, who was due to fly to China on an offical visit on Monday, The Ukrainian president is under fire for his centralisation of power, for the jailing of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and for widespread corruption. His spokesmen did not respond to requests for comment. But speaking on condition of anonymity, several government advisers conceded he could be toppled.  
&gt;
“The next few days will be critical, clearly,” said Timothy Ash, an analyst at Standard Bank. “The opposition appear to now have momentum on their side and will aim to use this to their advantage. Yanukovich faces the choice of either trying to re-impose control through the use of the security services or police, or negotiation.”  
&gt;...  
Stepan Havrysh, a political commentator and former deputy national security chief, said in an afternoon television interview: “The people’s peaceful demonstrations have transformed into a revolutionary state.”  
&gt;
“There is no more trust in the president” from the people or his political allies, Mr Havrysh added, saying that a handful of once loyal lawmakers were leaving his party.  
&gt;
He predicted that the president would probably lose his majority in parliament within days.  
&gt;
Mykhailo Volynets, leader of Ukraine’s independent coalminers’ union which has a big membership in Mr Yanukovich’s heartland of industrial eastern Ukraine, said a split in the country was unlikely.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"""Liberal"" has a very different meaning for Europeans, or at least in France. In France (but I suspect, most of Europe), ""liberal"" is actually synonymous to ultra-capitalist, and thus ""liberal"" is associated to the right wing. So the funny thing is that an unknowing casual European would criticize the American Republicans for being too ""liberal"". 

Just saying, before you want to make bold comments in /r/europe, you might want to listen first, and understand the politics and vocabulary here. To stay safe, just speak of the left and right. That, at least, is pretty universal.

Otherwise, while I get your argument, and agree to a certain extent, your view of things is ironically pretty restrictive. Let me make a strawman argument : ""hey, you don't think I'm allowed to have sex with a 10 year old? You're not liberal enough! Liberals will win, you conservative! Ultimately, it will be allowed"". 

I am for gay marriage. Totally for it. But your argument is that ""liberals"" strive for change in society, for the better, according to your standards. But where is the limit? who are you to judge that limit? Maybe you'll be conservative to the future generation who'll think it's liberal to marry a cow. I'm not saying homosexuality is comparable to pedophilia or bestiality (I know it looks like I'm comparing it all, but bare with me), I'm just trying to convey that what is ""progressive"" and ""conservative"" changes all the time. And you'll probably be very conservative compared to your children. Who knows how society will change in the future.

Also, ""liberal"" societies have turned back to ""conservatism"". Iran, for example. I think ""liberals"" and ""conservatives"" are both necessary, so we can find a middle ground through debate on what morality we want for our societies. So we can compromise, and not fall into any extreme. Because both sides can be extreme.

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"&gt; Pourquoi est-ce que je prêterais de l'argent si je n'en retire rien ?

Pour la même raison qui fait que tu as un compte courant: une dette est plus sûre à transporter que du liquide.

&gt; Quand je te prête de l'argent, c'est de l'argent que je ne peux plus dépenser pendant une certaine période

En effet, et ce service vaut quelque chose, mais en étant en concurrence avec toutes les autres personnes qui veulent faire ""travailler"" ce capital, les taux n'arriveront pas à zéro mais presque. 

Je peux même imaginer un scénario dans lequel un montage fiscal permettrait à une personne d'esquiver l'ISF en prêtant de l'argent à un taux négatif s'il le faut.

&gt; Cela peut me faire perdre de l'argent (par exemple si j'ai l'opportunité d'investir dans quelque chose, mais que je ne peux pas parce que je viens de te prêter mon argent...)

Oui, tu peux sûrement trouver un taux plus intéressant dans un placement plus risqué, mais le risque zéro a un taux naturel de zéro.

Note que je mentionne le taux d'inflation également. On peut construire une argumentation pour dire qu'un risque zéro justifie quand même d'exiger le taux d'inflation en intérêts. Je n'en suis pas tout à fait convaincu, mais je ne vois pas de raison pour que le taux d'intérêt d'un risque zéro soit entre 0 et le taux d'inflation.

Immigrants.

Encore une bataille de chiffres...

À chaque manif, depuis celle des retraites, ça me désespère. Je suis développeur informatique, spécialisé en analyse d'image et je ne comprends pas pourquoi, depuis tant de temps que c'est techniquement faisable, personne ne s'est intéressé à mettre en place un comptage prouvable du nombre de personnes à une manif.

J'ai crée un soft simple pour faire ça: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYuDiQDM0MM

Il est open source: https://github.com/yquemener/HeadCounter

Si quelqu'un est intéressé pour mettre ça en place à une manif, contactez moi, je vous donne toutes les billes. Ce soft ne donnera pas un nombre précis, mais entre 7 000 et 100 000 il permettra de dire lequel des deux camps est dans les mensonges.

Sachant que la police estime généralement 1 personne au m² et les organisateurs 1.5, que la police ne compte pas les trottoirs et que les organisateurs le font, un ratio de 2 est normal.

De ce que j'ai lu des chercheurs qui ont travaillé sur le sujet, j'ai tendance à croire plutôt les chiffres de la police (qui tendent à sous estimer de 10 à 20% seulement) que ce soit pour les manifs de gauche ou de droite.
