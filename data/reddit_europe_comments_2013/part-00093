Roosevelt wanted to connect the military fleets on the east and west coast of the US and if that didn't happen the US would always be at a naval disadvantage. *In Roosevelt's mind no canal meant practically no fleet.*

&gt;Roosevelt believed the canal was of great importance because the distance at that time from New York to San Francisco -- you had to go around the tip of South America -- was something like 13,600 miles. And in order to move the American fleet from the Atlantic to the Pacific in case there was a war, say, with Russia or Japan in the Pacific, would take an extraordinary amount of time. With the canal, the distance is reduced to about 5,000 miles. And Roosevelt saw this instantly as not only a tremendous boon as far as American commerce was concerned, but it would be a way of shifting the American fleet and keeping the fleet together from the Atlantic to the Pacific, or back, depending upon where the fleet was needed. As far as Roosevelt was concerned then, the building of a great navy, the United States entry into this imperial race, and the building of a canal were all parts of the same foreign policy. And without the canal, the rest of the foreign policy would not fall into place.

La question du choix de ces élites, même si elle est en grande partie ce que tu entends par méritocratique ( et en partie non, càd héritage social, culturel, patrimonial ) et surtout en France avec la culture du diplôme, n'est jamais totalement déterminée au niveau du concours. La suite de la carrière ( ie la course au CV, qui bien souvent est foncièrement qu'une question de marketing et de chance ( asymétrie de l'information ) ) est aussi un élément déterminant dans le choix ""méritocratique"" des élites. Et être doué pour gérer sa carrière n'est pas forcément garant d'une vraie compétence technique. 

Tout cela, je pense, est à mettre en parallèle avec la course aux honneurs pour les Ivy League américaines qui commence à la maternelle avec tout un tas d'activités extracuricullaires censées démontrer la valeur du candidat ( Spelling bees, Science project où un ado de 14 ans devient co-auteur avec un Prix Nobel de John Hopkins, Prouesses pré-olympiques dans un sport) en terme de leadership. Ils sont revenus depuis bien longtemps de leurs premiers balbutiements où l'emphase sur les tests les conduisaient à avoir un nombre disproportionnés de juifs talmudiques et quasi-autistes qui ne pourraient jamais vendre leur image de marque. C'est ce qui justifie aussi puissamment tous les critères actuels de sélection ethnique ( qui diminue le nombre d'Asiatiques introvertis et avec des scores de SAT parfaits et augmente le nombre de Latino et de Noirs avec des résultats beaucoup moins stellaires scolairement mais qui n'ont pas moins de chance de réussir par la suite ). Et il ne semble pas que les USA aient du mal à se fournir en élites par ce système pourtant peu conforme à nos moeurs. 

Au vu des deux paragraphes précédents je comprends que tu places ta définition des élites au niveau où la discussion te semble importante ( càd la sélection par l'école et les résultats scolaires et donc la question de l'éducation ) mais je prenais un point de vue un peu plus large si je puis me permettre avec néanmoins un constat qui me paraît commun aux deux approches : On ne peut devenir élite de manière subversive et, que ce soit par le concours ou par un devenir en conformité avec l'idée que les élites se font d'elles-mêmes, il y a la nécessaire appropriation des codes de conduite intellectuels, sociaux et culturels et qui se fait d'abord à l'école et, peut-être, dans d'autres institutions de formation de l'enfance vers l'adulte, conservatoire, catéchisme, scouts, colonies, etc, mais avant tout à l'école.

D'où ma bondieuserie bourdieusienne, partant de ce que j'ai dit sur le mode de création d'une élite et sur l'aspect de la méritocratie que je trouve au final le plus injuste ou peut-être le plus cruel, c'est qu'on n'accède au statut ""d'élite"" ( et là je mets des guillemets parce qu'actuellement on voit quand même assez bien, notamment à l'endroit où on est passé, que la réussite d'un concours n'est garante de rien, ce qui se voit dans les résultats médiocres de la transformation de cette réussite ponctuelle en une réussite durable ( surtout quand on se retrouve avec un bon 80% d'enfants du sérail qui bénéficieront d'un avantage compétitif dès la sortie de l'école ). Et que même la pratique du concours et de ce que tu appelles aujourd'hui ""élite"" administrative est absolument dévalorisée par les pratiques de tours extérieurs dans une forme de spoils system qui sont aujourd'hui courantes ( et incompréhensibles dans un contexte de réduction des effectifs ) ) qu'au prix d'un arrachement social, culturel et tout simplement humain. L'ascenseur social est, culturellement, humainement, sans retour. Ce qui nous ramène maintenant au sujet traité dans l'entretien du Monde : Comment permettre un combat ( dans le sens débat démocratique selon la définition de Ricoeur : ""Est démocratique, une société qui se reconnaît divisée, c’est-à-dire traversée par des contradictions d’intérêt et qui se fixe comme modalité, d’associer à parts égales, chaque citoyen dans l’expression de ces contradictions, l’analyse de ces contradictions et la mise en délibération de ces contradictions, en vue d’arriver à un arbitrage"" ) à armes égales avec des populations qui sont déjà traditionnellement privées d'expression ( j'ai pas envie de rappeler le traitement des ouvriers de PSA quand ils ont fait irruption au séminaire du PS, ça va m'énerver, mais c'est un excellent exemple ) quand les élites assimilent socialement ( et donc font coïncider leurs intérêts avec ) les personnes qui auraient pu être les plus à même de porter l'expression de ces populations sans existence verbale ( puisqu'étant les personnes ayant à la fois l'expérience commune de ces populations et la compréhension des codes permettant de conceptualiser leurs problèmes en des termes audibles par le pouvoir ). Après tout cela, l'idée même d'une justice intrinsèque à la société française grâce à la méritocratie, assez drôle en soi, n'est qu'un instrument pour endormir la foule ( et lui filer un sacré complexe d'infériorité allant de pair avec la ""non-légitimité"" des populismes ( sacré oxymore aussi, puisqu'on aurait des gouvernants choisis par le peuple souverain mais qui suivraient des politiques qui ne seraient pas au profit du peuple, ie non-populistes ? ) ). 

Pour finir et répondre à ta dernière question, je pense que le concours est toujours un instrument légitime ( mais plus uniquement légitime, cf supra où j'ai parlé des tours extérieurs, qui diminuent le caractère méritocratique tout comme certains types de promotions internes ) de choix de certains cadres administratives. Qu'il a été détourné de son principe par les élites actuelles ( filet de sécurité pour politiciens de carrière ou pantouflage ). Que dans une optique de rééquilibrage démocratique ( perso, je ne suis pas spécialement démocrate mais c'est le sujet ), il est évident que la nébuleuse de l'Etat dans l'Etat constituée par ces hauts-fonctionnaires devrait être assortie d'un contrôle strict par des comités plus citoyens. Qu'un des problèmes majeurs est que la France ( et quasiment toute l'Europe en fait ) prend énormément de retard de par son arc-boutement contre des formes désirables de promotion sociale de la diversité ( et soyons honnête, l'école française est un gouffre inefficace donc le concours ne réussira pas là où l'apprentissage de la lecture n'arrive pas à se faire ) en se reposant sur une assimilation qui, dans un contexte d'appauvrissement et non de croissance, ne pourra se faire. Que l'autre problème majeur est que, de l'état antérieur d'élites créant pour le peuple une narration commune, peuple à qui ils étaient redevables et avec qui ils étaient forcés de vivre dans les limites de l'espace national, on assiste à l'émergence d'une élite qui a relégué le peuple au passé et agi comme s'il était devenu une contigence fâcheuse mais inconséquente.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"Yes I know that, however it still bugs me that people use a type of language and a way of phrasing things which implies that entities like Britain, America and the Netherlands are homogenous which they aren't. But there are definitely people out there who believe that they are homogenous so using such language perpetuates this unfounded belief. 

Additionally I also wanted to make the point that the phrase ""The US..."" is even more unfounded here than usual because it wasn't even that much of a wide spread phenomenon. It was a relatively short lived piece of stupidity which didn't even involve that many Americans as so few news sources made the mistake of saying that ""Czechs are Chechnya"" and even the news outlets that did make that mistake rectified it relatively quickly.

Usually with these sorts of things we can expect it to at least be wide spread which this wasn't relative to other such events.

Yes, I would say that at least a majority of people recognise that when some one says ""America..."" ""Britain..."" ect that they're not talking about every single person, but even so they are perpetuating something stupid.

I wonder if it would be a good idea to socialize them. We could just bill them for all the estimated costs at once, they go bankrupt immediately, and the state takes over. That would also imply that we get back control over our infrastructure (power lines). Then we create one non-profit organisation that maintains the grid, one that controls decommissioning of old nukes, and one that maintains active power plants. They are all backed by the tax payer, so the delicate process of decommissioning will be covered unless the German state goes bankrupt. Nuclear and coal power plants wouldn't have to run profitably, they would just have to cover base load. Three separate taxes on electricity make up for the losses of those non-profits, creating political pressure to keep them efficient and get rid of coal, nuclear and gas as soon as possible.

Ich hege starke Zweifel daran, dass der Staat seinen Bürgern hier so ohne weiteres vertrauen kann; auch wird der „Rabatt“ erst dann gewährt werden können, nachdem ein Kind vorhanden ist. Positiv aus meiner Sicht, dass die traditionelle Familie sich in diesem Konzept grundsätzlich wieder findet. Für sehr gefährlich halte ich jedoch die Ökonomisierung von nichtehelichen Lebenspartnerschaften. Ich könnte mir durchaus vorstellen, dass derartige „Partnerschaften“ aus rein steuertechnischen Gründen geschlossen werden. In dem vorgeschlagenen System benötige ich zur Steuerersparnis lediglich einen Partner mit der gleichen Meldeadresse (sollte kein Problem sein, da weitere Fürsorgepflichten entsprechend einer Ehe entfallen) sowie ein anerkanntes Kind, welches nach Minimalanforderungen bis zum Abschluß der ersten Ausbildung zu Versorgen ist (man müsste die entstehenden Kosten also nur der pot. Steuerersparnis gegenüberstellen). Für beide „Elternteile“ könnte eine solche Übereinkunft sicher von Vorteil, dem Kindeswohl dürfte dieses jedoch ehr abträglich sein.

daher fordern einige Politiker aus dem linken Spektrum eine Erbschaftssteuer von 100% …

Mag sein (das wäre im Übrigen eine Enteignung! und damit im höchsten Maße rechtswidrig), genauso fordern einige wirtschaftsliberale Politiker die Abschaffung der Erbschaftssteuer, da es sich hier um eine Doppelbesteuerung von Vermögenswerten handelt.

Bei der „äußeren Erscheinung“ in der Gastronomie meinte ich nicht Berufskleidung. Vielmehr stellen auch individuelle Haargestaltung, Tattoos und Piercings einen rechtmäßigen Kündigungsgrund dar, soweit diese mit dem vom Arbeitgeber geforderten Erscheinungsbild nicht übereinstimmen. Auch hier muß ich also als Arbeitnehmer entscheiden, ob ich eine Einschränkung meines individuellen Ausdrucksrechts zugunsten eines Einkommensvorteils in Kauf nehme.

Was nun explizit die katholische Kirche angeht, habe ich mich im Rahmen der gerade stattgefunden öffentlichen Diskussion etwas Schlau gemacht (bin selber kein Katholik). Es ist obwohl vielfach behauptet wird schlicht nicht wahr, dass eine Trennung nicht erfolgen kann. So ist eine Scheidung zwar ausgeschlossen, jedoch kann eine Ehe durchaus, in Folge eines theologischen Begutachtungsverfahren, annulliert werden – wobei es hier auch nur um kirchlich geschlossene Ehen geht – nicht um standesamtliche, welche kirchenrechtlich keine Ehen darstellen. Ob das nun gut oder schlecht ist muß jeder für sich entscheiden, nur wenn ich mich einmal für einen Glauben entschieden habe, kann ich nicht nur die Vorteile in Anspruch nehmen (wobei dieser letzte Satz durchaus schon allgemein gültig ist).

Von daher ist es notwendig die Projekte realistisch zu kalkulieren (mit entsprechenden Preisen und Zeiten) und aus Sicht des Wählers die Politiker da rauszuhalten. Solange die Politiker in diesem Spiel für die Wahl Spatenstich-Fotos etc. haben wollen, solange wird es Einmischungen in diese Projekte geben. 

Außerdem muss man auch offen damit umgehen dass diese Projekte nun mal nicht nach Plan verlaufen, das ist jedem halbwegs normal denkendem Projektleiter klar.

The plant had a total power of 3000MW, one wind turbine delivers around 5MW, thus this single power plant provided as much energy as 600 modern wind turbines operating at full power (which is subject to the current wind).",0,1368299152,null,0,false,0,c9wvbzy,t3_1e4i3x,t1_c9wvbzy,t1_c9wr8bf,null,1431226022,-5,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,-5

Whilst I support the idea of a progressive tax policy (people who earn more should pay more tax as a percentage of income than those who're poorer) I don't think we should tax them for owning things. If they have a huge income and pay a huge amount of tax, then decide to spend that huge income on some very nice thing (which they'll pay VAT on), why would we continue to charge them for such things? They bought it and that's that. End of story.

I think that when we start to think ""oh look at that guy with his lavish lifestyle. There should be a law against it or something"" , I think that we've crossed a line. It's not our place to judge how others live. If they want to have a big family, that's nice. If they want to move abroad then that's nice. If they want to be very clever and become very rich, then that is also very nice. We shouldn't be putting in laws and taxes to spite people and their way of life.

We need to raise tax somehow and it's best to tax people with wealth rather than people who are earning lots. For a start taxing earnings causes people to work less hard.

The most convenient time to tax people is on their estate at death.

Finally something needs to happen to combat the magnetism of wealth. Once you pass a point where your wealth is such that you don't need to do anything at all - in fact you can just employ people to manage it for you - then that's wrong. 

We need a system which encourages people to work, but also where tax is progressive. What we have now is regressive with housing poverty, huge rates of effective tax on the very poor and fuel poverty from green 'incentives'.

Furthermore, we should tax financial gains on things like stocks and shares and property. At the moment people like Alan Sugar pay less tax (as a percentage) than their secretaries because they get paid in stocks and other financial devices. 

So there's where all the tax revenue you need is. Just tax people ethically and cut down on tax avoidance. 

You don't need to tax people for what they own. Tax them for what they earn and tax that properly without the loopholes which allow them to have headquarters in the Virgin Islands and which allow them to be paid in stocks and bonds whilst not paying their proper rate of tax. 

There are ethical ways of doing things. Don't just look for the easy way out. 

One final note: I'm heavily pro taxes and as I said before pro a progressive tax policy. I believe people at the top should pay more, but I believe they should pay only what is needed and what they do with their time is their own issue.

Now, fellow Europeans, please be aware of these little misconceptions about this person that appear in this thread:

**Bullshit 1)** He's an evil communist that wants to bring Soviet tanks to Prague and hang everyone. Actually, he was persecuted by the old regime quite a lot, and regards Russia as an economic partner which he wants to have a good relationship with. Also, he supports the Scandinavian model, as most people on reddit do, by the way.

**Bullshit 2)** He wants to make the Czech republic an authoritarian pseudo-democracy tied to the Kremlin and the Russian oil business. In fact, he's a hard-line eurofederalist, which goes quite the opposite way.

**Bullshit 3)** He is a primitive, stupid and rude person, and will make our country look like that. When people say that, they often compare him to his opponent in the elections, the well-dressed, cute, old, soft-spoken aristocrat with many friends in the European nobility, minister of foreign affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg.
Truth is, Milos Zeman is highly educated, and is an experienced politician, who helped to perform the transition from socialist to capitalist economy as a prime minister, and to ease the damages made by his predecessor in the same task. He is rude only to the mainstream right-wing media, and is very friendly to representatives of other countries.

Then take into consideration that the Czech English-speaking netizens are young and based mainly in/around Prague and other big cities, and the implications of these factors are: 

* they are heavily right-wing, since, *unlike in the rest of the world*, the youth around here is rightist and borderline libertarian;

* they are pissed Mr. Schwarzenberg didn't win, because they voted for him, being enchanted by his old-time visage and manners (there is a strange hipster-like strain of nostalgia about the Austro-Hungarian period), which also include sleeping during negotiations in the parliament or even [diplomatic negotiations](http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/news/foreign-affairs/czech-foreign-minister-naps-during-serbian-security-conference), and dismissing any criticism with pointing out the other sides weaknesses, however irrelevant, and attracted by his affiliation with the current government, popular for its intent to reduce the welfare state to a bare minimum, which they see as a way to cut themselves off from the ""old, stupid and unsuccessful"", while they are the ""young, smart, ambitious and privileged"".

&gt;American Jews have among the highest tested IQs, with means being usually reported in the 110–115 range. Yet Lynn and Vanhanen report that Israeli Jews have strikingly low IQs by comparison. One large sample from 1989 put the figure at 90, while a far smaller sample from 1975 indicated an IQ of 97, with both results drawn from Israel’s large Jewish majority rather than its small Arab minority. The IQ gaps with American Jews are enormous, perhaps as large as 25 points, and difficult to explain by genetic factors, since a majority of Israel’s Jewish population in that period consisted of ethnic Askhenazi (European) Jews, just like those in America.

One quip I remember, from reading up about him, was that he published an autobiography at a fairly young age while Wilson was still PM, and named it ""In My Way"". Which, Wilson was rumoured to have remarked, was ironic, ""since that's where I always found him"".

In reference to Brown's hystrionic tendencies, Wilson was also (apocryphically?) remarked to have said, when informed that Brown had sent his letter of resignation, ""put it with the others"".

You believe in progressive taxation policy, along with the overwhelming majority of the population, which is exactly drawing lines in the sand.

&gt; If they have a huge income and pay a huge amount of tax, then decide to spend that huge income on some very nice thing (which they'll pay VAT on), why would we continue to charge them for such things? They bought it and that's that. End of story.

Wealth taxes would be compensated by reductions in income taxes, so it wouldn't be double charging. 

None of this addresses the fundamental issue, which is the degree to which taxation should fall on income, and the degree that it should fall on wealth. It seems to me pretty inarguable that there should be some wealth element to it, although of course there are major problems (particularly with housing market inflation).",0,1368324464,null,0,false,0,c9x2644,t3_1e4vr3,t1_c9x2644,t1_c9wvsl8,null,1431222724,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,aveen,NETH,The Netherlands,"The Turkish Quarters(known as Bascarsija in Bosnian) is the most famous neighbourhood in Sarajevo and the most beautiful. It stems from the Ottoman Era and is therefore really old, a bit narrow, stone roads, few mosques etc. Just google image Bascarsija and you'll see what it looks like. It's quite central and everything is really close such as bars/clubs, stores everywhere, restaurants, hotels, musea etc. It will be very busy though. 

Bascarsija and the nearby city central streets will be really safe at any time as they are busy, a touristattraction and more expensive compared to other neighbourhoods. I wouldn't go walk around at 3am by myself though as there are a few(just like in any city) criminals wandering around. You'll also see quite some gypsie beggars, don't give them any money and just pass them or if they come to you simply give them a wave to bug off. They mainly target tourists because they are easier and tend to have more money, same thing applies to criminals. Just avoid walking around alone at night even though I doubt you""ll ever feel unsafe. The city is very ""alive"", contrary to most other places people in Sarajevo spend a lot of time outside/in the city instead of home behind the TV/computer especially in the summer. 

You'll see many cafe terraces, restaurants and patisseries(place where you can eat delicasies such as cakes/ice cream). It's quite cheap and Bosnians tend to spend a lot of time outside having a drink or eating somewhere. Seriously, they're everywhere. The neighbourhood you're staying in actually has the best ones, a bit more expensive but so so delicious. I suggest you try them all. I always gain so many pounds after visiting but it's so damn worth it. 

I'm actually born in Sarajevo but have lived my whole life in the Netherlands (Amsterdam). All my friends are dutch and ocassionaIy I bring some of them with me to Sarajevo and they always love it. We even tend to go a bit more rural and check out the nature and other smaller cities. I have a dutch aunt who fell in love with the city and actually moved there! One of my friends father also went there for a year for work.  I've never even heard anyone saying they feel unsafe to be honest. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying it's holy,every place has it's bad sides and so does Sarajevo. I'll tell you about those aswell.

There is quite some criminality among mostly young people (mostly gypsys). Especially carthievery but other thievery aswell.

You'll get taken advantage of as a foreigner. Locals try to take as much money as they can from tourists by raising their price for their goods/services once they see you're one. Same thing applies to beggars. 

Here's my advice for your stay and some things you might want to do:

- Don't be alone. I read you're going to study there so it'll be easy for you to befriend someone or some people and I suggest spending your time with others as it will make your experience much better and make you feel much more comfortable. They can even show you the city. Doesn't have to be a bosnian, there are enough international students. 

- Try the food and the delicasies. Seriously I've never met someone who doesn't love them.

- If you have time and can make the trip, go visit Mostar. It's a small but beautiful city not too far from Sarajevo. Many many tourists go there aside from Sarajevo. Really worth it if the trip isn't a big hassle.

- Learn a few basic Bosnian phrases it will help you during your stay and the locals will love it. Almost everyone under 30 speaks English though so don't worry about communication issues.

- Uss the trams/trolleybusses to go around the city, its cheaper than a taxi and a taxi might rip you off. If it's hot however, I would avoid public transport as it can get really packed.

- Tap water is drinkable

- The currency is the ""convertible mark"" or KM or ""marka"". 1 USD= 1.5KM

- A coffee is about 1.5KM
A hot meal about 6-10KM (pizza-steak)
Ciggaretes are 4KM
Taxifares about 10KM

I've never had to deal with any critics as I've yet to meet someone with a negative attitude towards Sarajevo AFTER having been there.

Can't really think of anything else at the moment. Ask away if you have any more questions

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"Une série d'articles de ce genre a été posté dans un autre forum, j'y avais fait une réponse un peu longue :

&gt; Pfoulalala, quel fouilli ces articles! Qu'en dire...

&gt; Le ""deep web"" peut vouloir dire plusieurs choses. Si tu parles juste de ce que tu ne peux pas trouver via Google, c'est potentiellement en effet assez gros, par contre ce n'en est pas secret pour autant. C'est un terme assez technique pour décrire les informations qui sont accessibles mais qui demandent plusieurs clics depuis un site de recherche.

&gt; Par exemple, tu peux trouver les tranins partant entre Paris et Lyon le vendredi entre 10h et 11h, mais cela ne fait pas partie de ce que Google connait, tu devras aller farfouiller sur le site de la SNCF qui t'impose de passer par son interface pour extraire l'info. C'est ça le deep web et c'est ça qui peut représenter 90% du web (en comptant comment ? En trafic ? En stockage ? Ce nombre m'a l'air arbitraire)

&gt; Par contre, les articles que tu mentionnes ne parlent pas de ça. Il parlent probablement de ce qu'on appelait le ""dark net"" (mais la wikipedia ne semble plus d'accord avec cet usage, étrange...). Ils semblent parler exclusivement de Tor, mais plusieurs autres choses similaires existent. Il s'agit de réseaux fonctionnant comme une surcouche à internet au sein desquels les informations sont cryptées et anonymisées. Le but est d'échapper à la fois à la surveillance et à la censure.

&gt; En Égypte ça permettait d'organiser des manifs, en Syrie aux rebelles de communiquer sans se faire chopper, en Iran d'accéder aux news de l’extérieur du monde. Dans les pays où internet est plus libre et où une recherche tendancieuse a moins de chances de vous emmener en prison, on ne l'utilise presque que pour des choses telles que le trafic d'armes et de drogue et, en théorie, la pédophilie (qui même sur ces réseaux est plutôt rare, mais doit forcément y en avoir en cherchant bien). 

&gt; Ce réseau internet là est tout petit, avec assez peu de contenu intéressant et quasiment rien de légal qui ne soit disponible également sur le net classique c'est assez désespérant.

&gt; Oui, c'est en effet un internet réellement libre où il est possible de surfer sans être espionné. En théorie en tous cas. Car un combat constant entre les développeurs de Tor et les gouvernements censeurs a lieu (la Chine est leur meilleur ennemi en ce moment) et les états ont plein de manips dans leurs manches pour amener une personne peu à l'aise techniquement à se trahir.

&gt; Bitcoin est également un projet très intéressant. C'est une expérience technique et économique : la création d'une monnaie virtuelle, autonome, sans aucune autorité centrale d'aucune sorte. Je ne sais pas si c'est une bonne ou une mauvaise chose, mais c'est une chose qui désormais existe, pour le meilleur et pour le pire, et ça change quelques règles du jeu, notamment vis à vis des institutions bancaires et fiscales. 

&gt; Tor et bitcoin sont deux projets souvent rattachés au mouvement crypto-anarchiste ou cypherpunk qui pense qu'il est possible de créer une sorte de société platonicienne des idées sur internet. Ils ont déjà réussi à proposer des moyens d'échanger et de contribuer, de partout dans le monde, d'une façon anonyme et d'échanger de l'argent de la même façon. Je ne sais pas ce que ça va donner, mais c'est assez passionnant à suivre. 

&gt; Et ce serait assez simpliste de résumer ça à de la vente de drogues et d'armes. Ce ne sont que des effets secondaires de la techno. D'autant plus qu'il existe là un maillon faible évident : le système de poste qui peut facilement intercepter les colis louche voire remonter les filières.",0,1368342933,null,0,false,0,c9x6fkt,t3_1e2btc,t1_c9x6fkt,t3_1e2btc,null,1431220715,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4
true,DaphneDK,FARO,Faroe Islands,"&gt; “This will probably shock you, but it is mainly for fiscal reasons,… simply because I do not feel like working all my life to pay taxes, a large part of which will only service the 1.9 trillion Euros of debt that your generation has kindly left us. If these borrowings had at least been invested to prepare the future of the country, if I was getting a small benefit from them, it would not be a problem for me to help repay them. But this debt only helped your generation live above its means, and assure itself a generous social safety net which I will not have.

&gt; (…)

&gt; My labor and my taxes will also pay for your generation’s retirement which you did not bother to plan, and for all the health and support expenses incurred by the elderly who in less than twenty years will be a majority of the population. So what will be left for me to live on and to raise my children?

&gt; (…)

&gt; And, if by some improbable miracle, I managed to make a lot of money, I know already that not only will I be paying most of it in taxes, but I will also endure the general reproach of my compatriots and your personal contempt.

&gt; This is why, Mr. President, I am thinking of leaving France. And why your [government] should be less worried about the dangers of immigration and more concerned with the threats of emigration by the youth of this country. Where would I go? Perhaps to Germany, a country that you frequently disparage but which looks like a confident country. Or perhaps further, to Canada or Australia. Or to a developing country. To Africa, why not?

&gt; (…)

&gt; Yes, I want to go to a country where there is growth, where wages are rising, where being rich is not a deadly sin, a country in short where the individual and the society have confidence that tomorrow will be brighter than today.”

Ich schrieb oben schon, dass es als Argument kritisch ist. Auch statistisch ist es fragwürdig, da das Heiratsalter lt. Mikrozensus bei Frauen bei 30 Jahren und bei Männern bei 33 Jahren liegt. Man müsste also jungen Menschen allgemein steuerrechtliche Vorteile bieten denn immerhin werden ja fast 75% von ihnen einmal Eltern.

&gt; Für beide „Elternteile“ könnte eine solche Übereinkunft sicher von Vorteil, dem Kindeswohl dürfte dieses jedoch ehr abträglich sein.

Für wie wahrscheinlich hältst Du es, dass jmd. aus steuerlichen Gründen ein fremdes Kind annimmt und damit auch die Pflichten übernimmt? Ich denke der Prozentsatz ist geringer als derer die nur aus steuerlichen Gründen heiraten (je nach Umfrage ca. 25%).

&gt; das wäre im Übrigen eine Enteignung! und damit im höchsten Maße rechtswidrig

Das Recht kann man ändern. Wir brauchen es aber nicht zu vertiefen, es sollte nur andere Sichtweisen aufzeigen. Ich selbst vertrete nicht diese Haltung.

&gt; Es ist obwohl vielfach behauptet wird schlicht nicht wahr, dass eine Trennung nicht erfolgen kann. So ist eine Scheidung zwar ausgeschlossen, jedoch kann eine Ehe durchaus, in Folge eines theologischen Begutachtungsverfahren, annulliert werden

Das hat zwei Haken. Erstens: um die Ehenichtigkeit anerkannt zu bekommen musst Du lügen, denn niemand ist so geistig umnachtet um einen der Gründe zu erfüllen.

Those breeder kind of reactors you're talking about, their development has been stalling (for technical reasons) for well over 2 decades. We won't see them around for another 20 years, even if we'd put all development efforts into them.

It sounds too good to be true: A reactor into which you can throw your nuclear waste. The problem is, it simply doesn't work like that, because not every isotope can be fissioned with a net gain in energy. Those breeder/waste eater reactors are mostly good for burning up the unused fuel and whatever amounts of transurans are produced from neutron capture.

Add to that the technical challenge: To work you need rector using fast neutrons for fuel breeding. But fission requires slow neutrons. So you need a reactor in which the fuel is constantly transported between regions of high, fast neutron flux and low, moderated neutron flux. So people are thinking about molten lead or molten salt in which the fuel is dissolved… Are those people completely nuts? How in the hell are you supposed to get the waste fission products, which will actually hamper the further operation of the reactor out of that? In addition those fission products are extremely radioactive, not despite, but because of their relative ""short"" half-life; a few 100 years still. But if you think about it, nuclear waste becomes safe only after about 10 half-lifes. That would still be thousands of years for which this waste must be kept safe. Okay, humans can build structures that withstand time for so long (the Pyramids for example), but how in the hell do you communicate that when you enter, you'll die. No, it's not a curse, just the most dangerous poison ever created and there's no cure for it and you can't render it inert.

Nuclear energy is probably the biggest folley of mankind ever, past and future. And all proponents of nuclear energy are hereby invited to actually learn about the physics (I graduated within a branch of nuclear physics) and wrap their heads about the geological timescales involved. The civil use of nuclear energy was proposed solely to shift nuclear research into a good light after the invention of the atomic bomb.

Simone Veil n'a pas souhaité s'exprimé sur le sujet, on ne sait pas pourquoi elle est allé à la manif et en effet c'est tellement contradictoire avec le personnage que ça pose des questions, mais tant qu'elle ne se sera pas exprimé on ne saura pas...

Et faut pas nous prendre pour des billes. Les gens à la manif contre le mariage pour tous ne sont pas là pour résoudre des petits problèmes de la loi ou pour offrir un cadre réellement idéal aux gays à force de discussion et de débat serein. 

On y a cru au temps du PACS, qui devait être un pacte civil offrant à peu près tous les droits du mariage sous un autre nom, et il a été tellement dépouillé de son sens pendant les débat que là c'est le mariage et l'égalité totale qui est demandée. Alors oui, ça pose quelques problèmes à certains endroits, mais faut pas venir pleurer comme quoi le débat a été rendu impossible.

La plupart des slogans à cette manif sont homophobes et revendiquent un ""ordre naturel"". Oui, c'est du conservatisme et du traditionalisme de bas étage.

Milan to Zurich but over the Alps rather than the direct train that uses the tunnel. First you get the local Italian train to Tirano. Then the Rhatische Bahn narrow gauge through Samedan, Andermatt and eventually Goschonen. This section is 3 or 4 different trains but they all connect and is an amazing journey and goes over the Bernina and Oberalp passes,  which are stunning. From Goschonen is the north side of the tunnel and you pick up the main line again to Zurich. Bear in mind this is a whole day of travel as opposed to a few hours but its worth it. 

From Andermatt on that route you can continue west on the Matterhorn Railway all the way to Zermatt at the base of the Matterhorn. 

The Rhatische Railway and the Matterhorn Railway have 'Express' trains that run the whole length (Glacier and Bernina Expresses) but I'd recommend getting the local trains as there are a lot cheaper, take only a bit longer and have openable windows. 

The Innsbrucke to Munich line via Garmische is also quite scenic. It begins by climbing the side of the valley Innsbrucke lies in before turning North past the Zugspitze, the highest mountain in Germany. 

In the UK the line from Glasgow to Fort William passes over Rannoch Morr which is beautiful and desolate. From Fort William you can continue north on the West Highland line to Mallaig (doable by steam train in the summer), Mallaig across to the Isle of Skye by ferry, bus to Kyle of Lochalsh where you pick up the railway again west coast to east coast at Inverness. The whole route goes over the Scottish Highlands and around remote lochs. ",0,1368354534,null,0,false,0,c9x7ucw,t3_1e6b9e,t1_c9x7ucw,t3_1e6b9e,null,1431220050,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

You can already make a gun by hand using regular tools and iron, and if you are careful it will be much better than plastic 3d printed gun.

I don't know much about the Portuguese gun laws, but I know more about the Swiss ones.

I'm a civilian gun owner in Switzerland.

There are extensive background checks before you are able to buy a semi automatic firearm or a pistol/revolver. The same does not apply for hunting rifles or shotguns where you only need a copy of your criminal records and your living permit/ID, the same applies to ammunition.

It's fairly easy to buy firearms in Switzerland if you are a law abiding citizen, I applied for a permit to buy 3 guns as I love to shoot for fun at a local club and I received the confirmation two weeks after applying for it.

You cannot carry the guns with you around the place, only from point A to B and getting a concealed carrying permit is almost impossible without a very, very good reason.

All guns are registered and so is the ammo. But there is no limit to how much ammo you can buy.

Full automatic rifles are allowed if you have a special permit to own them, but after getting it the police will appear by surprise at your home to see if you are storing them properly and safely. To shoot them you have to get another permit each time you want to do it.

I'm happy with the gun laws in Switzerland, there is low criminality, but high suicide cases which can be related to the availability of guns.

Edit: I bought my guns for sports originally, without knowing much about which guns were allowed at the shooting clubs endorsed by the state.

Usage on private property is permitted, when not in use it has to be stored very very safely and it is controlled by random searches. To carry a gun in public, that is not enclosed, loaded and not on route to use on private property, you need a special permit that is essentially impossible to get.

Even if you work as an au pair you are legally obligated to report your income to the competent Finanzamt. You report this income as ""Einkommen aus selbstständiger Tätigkeit"" on your tax form.

It, and Hannan's response, forced a second inspection.   

Taken at face value it looked as if Hannan was advocating a US typical healthcare model, and Miliband accused Hannan of being opposed to Universal Healthcare coverage.

Hannan's response was that he'd written extensively in one of his books about healthcare and was a clear proponent of universal coverage, but also rejected the US system.  He is a strong advocate of the Singapore model.

What Hannan did say, which fed into the US narrative, was once a government gets directly involved in providing healthcare than it creates a taboo department.  Once in place no government that wants to get elected can do so by arguing for healthcare cuts; that it's either ring-fence adjusted to inflation or promises of more spending.  Anything else is political suicide.  As such, Hannan argues, an unustainable behemoth in the making is hatched, because any government cut in spending (other than waste/bureaucracy) will rightly be seen ultimately leading to someone dying.  That it puts the government in an impossible situation and puts other departments at risk.

The Fox interview was terrible.  An embarrassment.  I disagree with his Singapore model (although it clearly works very well for Singapore), but if the extensive argument made is considered, and not a dumbed-down soundbite version on Fox, then there's more to Hannan's case.

The speech contained new anti-immigration measures, such as requiring landlords to check the immigration status of tenants, and requiring short-term migrants to pay for health care. A lot of this is motivated by the rise of UKIP (a right-wing populist anti-EU party), who did well at the local elections last week.

The Prime Minister has been criticised for not including anything about calling a referendum on Britain's membership in the EU in the speech, and several prominent Conservative politicians have said this week that we would support Britain's withdrawal from the EU. 

Also, Sir Alex Ferguson resigned as manager of Manchester United Football Club, after 26 years in charge. Bradley Wiggins is not doing very well in his attempt to win the Giro d'Italia, but Wigan – a football club in danger of being relegated from the Premier League – won the FA Cup (the main domestic cup).

Step 1: Do the hunting exams. Know about hunting itself (animals, seasons, what kind of ammo on animals etc) and know how to shoot.

Step 2: Find land to hunt on. In order to get a firearm you need land to hunt on. This country counts many hunters that own land and you don't have to be a big shot to be assigned to land just find a hunting forum and ask for it. Meet the person owning the land, buy him a vodka or whiskey (be polite) and he'll sign you as a ""guest shooter"" thus passing the requirement to have land to hunt on. Will you actually hunt there ? Most likely not as there are probably more ""guest hunters"" signed up there. But most people don't hunt in The Netherlands anyway, like myself i have my hunting rifles in Sweden due to the vast amount of land there and easy hunting laws. Most dutch folk go to Germany.

Step 3: Go to the police station and apply for a permit to own firearms. If you don't have a criminal record you'll pass the test. They are not allowed to decline just because ""you might be a threat"", it's about facts not ""might be"". If it is declined for whatever reason and you don't have a criminal record, you should take it to court and you'll more than likely pass.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt;I find the claims of both nations a bit silly. Britain claims it because the British Empire used force to take the land off the Spanish empire. The UK's claim rests on the fact that it was head of the British Empire and therefore still owns the islands.

That is not the UK's argument. The UK's argument is, and has been for the last 70 odd years since the dissolution of the Empire that the people who live on the Falkland Islands are in control of their own destiny and have the right to self determination. The people of the Falklands should decide what happens to the Falklands Islands via the democratic process. The UK has held referendums in the Falkland Islands many times, I think one of them was less than a year ago and every time the Falkanders have said that they want to remain British (and who can blame them). 

The UK's argument is about the rights of a people to choose their own destiny.

The Argentine' argument is that the Falklands are nearby and also used to be part of the entity that became Argentina (they were never actually controlled by Argentina itself). Argentina does not care for the people who have lived there for generations and thinks that the rights of this region that have never lived on territory belonging to Argentina should be ignored.

The UK's argument is much more sophisticated than that. The UK's argument is about ethics, rights and morality where as the Argentine argument is about the acquisition of territory and ignoring the rights of a group of people.

Please don't try and say that both arguments are equally flawed. If the Falklanders said they wanted home rule or to be part of Argentina or anything, we would let them do it without further notice. The same deal with Scotland. Please don't try and think that the UK is ignoring the democratic process or that for the UK this is about some aquisition of territory. the mainland UK benefits strategically from the Falklands, yes, but they are part of the UK because that is what they wish.

First and foremost because any kind of legislation is anti-liberal and I like liberty. If there is no massive reason to ban something it shouldn't be.

Don't think guns are necessary? Don't own them. The absence of necessity doesn't imply the requirement to ban something. And decentral storage is preferable to central storage. Break into a house, you get a couple of guns. Break into a central storage and you get all the guns.

&gt;I don't think UK or Argentina is owning the land. I guess its the Yámana's land, but they are almost extinguished.

The islands were completely unoccupied before they were discovered by Europeans.



&gt;I don't understand why there are no negotiations on UN level. This also includes questions why Argentinians do not have the right to buy land, or live on the Malvinas (and these questions should not be decided by the inhabitants of the island alone)



Before Argentina invaded there were negotiations mediated by the UN that lasted 17 years, however they existed in a stalemate as the British government considered that the people living on the islands had rights to self-determination, while the Argentinians ignored those rights entirely. The UN was on the side of the UK as the guidelines under which they were negotiating put an emphasis on self-determination. These talks were entirely ended by the UK after the invasion, and the UK resisted starting the talks again as opposed to the UNs requests.

~~Before Argentina invaded there were negotiations taking place to give the islands to them. We also offered a 50/50 split on any oil discovered around the islands; Argentina refused in favour of having 100% of the oil. Once they invaded, public opinion polarised for obvious reasons however.~~",0,1368371107,null,0,1368375515,0,c9xaduj,t3_1e6gxh,t1_c9xaduj,t1_c9xa9r9,null,1431218782,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

Correct. They have no MPs, but they do have MEPs and councillors.

It's hard to tell how the Conservatives would be acting if UKIP wasn't around, but we can be fairly certain they wouldn't be making pledges to hold referendums if UKIP wasn't and pledges by some Conservative cabinet members to remove the European Convention on Human Rights I reckon is in part motivated by the rise in Euroscepticism personified by UKIP.

So basically yeah, the Tories are pandering even more anti Europe than they would otherwise be (and possibly more right wing, but that's harder to observe).

&gt; it seems that they dominate more and more of the public discourse. Is that impression correct or are the papers exagerrating?

I'm not sure exactly what all the papers are saying, but they seem to be dominating the political landscape at the moment, yes.

The UN brought us into negotiations in 1964, however they never got anywhere other than promoting transport links like ferrys and airplane links. When ever the UK seemed to be giving way, the Falklands lobby in parliament managed to sway opinion back to staying British. Towards the end of this in 1980, the lobby grew so strong that the UK Minister of the Commonwealth just announced that the islanders right to self determination was paramount. The Argentinian side of the talks in contrast ignored the rights of the islanders entirely, presumably seeing them as displaced British people. The talks seemed to exist in a stalemate and lasted for 17 years. I can't actually find any mention of oil before the war either; the argument seemed entirely nationalistic rather than economical.

true,Futski,DENK,Kongeriget Danmark,"I am fully aware of that, I didn't take Social Science in school for no reason. But that doesn't lower our living costs. I'm more worried about whether you understand how it works here. 

Our model is based on government support and solidarity. The German model is based on insurances just to bring in a different example.

Okay. Crash Course Scandinavian Welfare and Work Model is in session. 

In Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries, we pay buttloads of taxes. More taxes than you can ever imagine in your wildest dreams. These taxes goes to fund the health sector, education, law enforcement and so on like in other countries. But because of our high tax levels, there's money to give students an economical boost. 

The reason we have unemployment benefits is because of how our work model is. Here you can get fired from your job with a single snap, because you are not necessarily going to lose your house or possesions in case you lose your job, unlike other countries, where it can be extremely difficult to get fired, once you have a job(I'm looking at you Greece). That gives the job market an extreme flexibility, because a business can fire and hire almost as they please. There are close to no laws, except you are entitled to 3 months pay(Whether they want you work in that period or not depends on the reason you were fired). 

But it all comes at a price. Since such a big part of our income goes to the welfare sector, we need a higher salary, because we only got 50% of our pay check to spend on all the stuff that the government doesn't cover. And all the stuff we are buying is heavily taxed too. Everything has 25% VAT as I have mentioned so many times, but there's also other taxes. We had a tax on fat and sugar untill very recently. 

And then inflation kicks in, while we still only have 50% of what we earn to spend. So the salaries and the costs of living knows only one way, and that's up. 

And now it's in a deep crisis, as skilled labourers from Eastern Europe are able to do the same jobs as unskilled Danish labourers previously did. And that makes unemployment go up. And here's the thing. 

Unemployment in our model is more straining, as it puts a lot more pressure on the working people than it does in other work models in form of more taxes for benefits. Which then makes people want more pay because now a bigger part of your salary is taken away, which then jacks up the prices, which then makes the unemployed demand bigger benefits, which then increases taxes even further, which then makes people want more pay. 

And then we got a cycle going. And since we have had some periods of huge unemployment since the early 70's where the welfare sector was established, living costs has had a long time to build up to the level on which they are now.

Certainly correct in my opinion. It's true that their main policy is to leave the EU, but they also function as a more generalised protest party, which is why they tend to have their greatest success in elections that the general public don't really care about, such as the European ones. Whether they will actually have any success at the next parliamentary election (in 2015) remains to be seen.

true,aveen,NETH,The Netherlands,"Baščaršija is the name for the old bazaar in Sarajevo, there is no neighbourhood in Belgrade with the same name I believe. You might be confusing it with this neighbourhood: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skadarlija or with 'Stari grad' which means old town. The difference is that Baščaršija is of Turkish/Ottoman origin whereas the neighbourhoods in Belgrade would be of Bohemian origin. You'll see for yourself when you're there. 

I'm glad you're going to Mostar and yes I've been to those other places and they're great I just didn't know whether you would be too busy with school to be able to visit them. Depending on your interests I'd say for myself as a young adult those places are worth visiting once but nothing too special compared to Sarajevo and Mostar.

Although most bosnians know the Cyrillic alphabet, it is barely used. We just use the latin alphabet and writing is also done in the latin alphabet. So no need for any Cyrillic.

Well the biggest sport is football(soccer) and a team already just won the championship. The national team has no matches scheduled untill September. Sarajevo film festival start in mid August so I guess thats a little late for you aswell. The biggest festival is Baščaršija Nights. It's between the 1st and 31st of July. It's basically a lot of cultural performances that are being played in the neighbourhood you're staying in. So all sorts of music, theatre, film, opera etc. I guess you'll see quite some of that. If you really want to check out a football match, go see a Zeljeznicar(current champions) match or a Sarajevo match. They're both teams stationed in Sarajevo and there's quite a big rivalry between the two, you just missed out on the biggest game of the year between the two though but seeing a regular match can be fun too although it is the end of the season atm. Tickets are super cheap, like a few dollars is enough. 

Here's a link with a few historical sites in Sarajevo: http://www.visitsarajevo.biz/sightseeing/attractions/historical-sarajevo.
If you're interested in war related things you should definitely check out the war tunnel. The site shows other things you could visit aswell or just really ask some locals when you're there and they'll show you the best spots.

Do's:

- ask them to show you some of their favorite places in the city

- ask them how their everyday life is 

- ask them what team they support, they will either say Zeljeznicar or Sarajevo. Sarajevo fans will be a bit butthurt because they just lost to Zeljeznicar again in the race to the championship title. Zeljeznicar fans will be very happy that you know about their club and will instantly become your best friend. (A bit exxagerated but football is an important part of a Sarajevans life)

Don't:

- tell them about how much of a better life you have/can get in the States or brag about some things they miss out on

- discuss religion, I don't know whether you're religious or not but even though bosnians are not very practicing when it comes to religion, they are very protective of their identity and don't like it when you insult their beliefs. Most of the times it just ends in one person getting irritated, if you're comfortable it wont be that much of a hassle then just go for it but try to listen to them about their beliefs first then bring up your own.

War is a difficult one. It depends on the person. There's one important thing you have to keep in mind: don't tell them their wrong or that what they're saying is a lie/exaggerated. Most people will be biased about what happened and about the enemy. A Bosniak(Bosnian Muslim) will give you a different story then a Orthodox Bosnian. I'd say you can bring up the war and talk about it, just don't try to take sides. Don't bring it up when there are multiple people as they may have different opinions, just talk to someone about it when it's just you and him and he will gladly talk to you about it. Some however have lost family/friends in the war and might not want to talk about it, just leave it and don't bring it up anymore with them around.

Overtime the father-son relationship doesn't change as much as mother-son, so it wasn't relevant in this class. I think the documentary we watched focused on men with good jobs and everything because it's with them that the contrast is most visible ; they have all the keys to independance but choose another way of life. For example one of the men did have his own house (and a very nice one with that), but chose to spend most of his time at his parents' place. It wouldn't have been as striking if it was a guy staying with his parents because he doesn't make enough to move out.

This is about criminal trails (and there are exceptions in which courts are allowed to invalidate evidence - if there are strong reasons).

BGH Az. I ZR 121/08 is about non secured W-Lan (used by a stranger who commits a crime; in which case BGB §1004 applies, meaning they can force them to secure it &amp; and sign a ""Unterlassungserklärung"" (for both!, as well as getting some money for ""Abmahnkosten"" but not money for damages), which is different: it takes almost no effort to secure a W-Lan, but it is almost impossible to prevent a young adult (18) form using the family internet connection for bad things. 

There is this other decision ( [LG Köln, 01.12.2010 - 28 O 594/10](http://openjur.de/u/537908.html) - took forever to find, interesting are Paragraph 56, 9, and 37; more below) in which ""Störerhaftung"" apllied because the child was not told to not use Filesharing (1), had a Admin accont on said PC (2) and there was no Firewall (3). (2) and (3) do probably not apply to older childs, as compleatly using a PC makes (2) and (3) impossible (Example: you cannot play League of Legends) - due to the fact that the the parent faild to supervise the child, and  the high need for supervision during the high risk task of using the internet (lol, but that is the opinion of the court...) the parents could be sued for compensation.

Details to: [LG Köln, 01.12.2010 - 28 O 594/10](http://openjur.de/u/537908.html) Imho, the interesting are Paragraph 56 as well as 9 *""Im weiteren Verlauf stellte sich heraus, dass die Beklagte zu 2) hierfür verantwortlich war.""* (which means the parend probably confessed/told them - do not do that) and 37 *""d) Die Beklagten haben auch bislang keine ausreichende Unterlassungserklärung abgegeben, die die Wiederholungsgefahr hätte ausschließen können.""* - so giving a modified ""Unterlassungserklärung"" should be done.

 Also, it seems that you need a concrete claim to apply Störerhaftung: if there are several possibilities, I think it would be impossible to actually sue somebody - in particular within the statute of limitations (which is 3 years ( and whatever is left till the next full year) scince the discovery).",0,1368380135,null,0,1368380561,0,c9xcy7x,t3_1dxaie,t1_c9xcy7x,t1_c9x94by,null,1431217573,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Ich gehe von einer höheren Zahl als 25% Trittbrettfahrern aus. Wie schon erwähnt würde die Unterstützung des Lebenspartners (Zugewinnteilung, Unterhaltspflicht) wegfallen. Auch dass Kind müsste nicht „voll“ finanziert werden, es ist genau so gut denkbar ein älteres Kind (bspw. zu Beginn der Ausbildung) anzunehmen (das würde den Finanzierungsaufwand beträchtlich senken), dieses ließe sich beliebig oft und ohne größere Schwierigkeit wiederholen. Evtl. habe ich etwas übersehen aber außer der Unterhaltspflicht wüsste ich keine weiteren anfallenden Verpflichtungen (von etwaigen moralischen einmal abgesehen).

&gt; So streng kann das in der Gastronomie nicht gehandhabt werden 

… glaub mir es wird. Es ist natürlich ein Unterschied, ob wir über eine angelernte Bedienung in einer Szenekneipe oder einer voll ausgebildeten Hotelfachkraft in einem 5-Sterne-Hotel reden (um nur mal zwei Extreme zu nennen).

Warum nun eine Ehe geschieden werden sollte oder zerrüttet ist, darüber kann man sicher lange und hitzig diskutieren. Es scheint mir doch aber im Allgemeinen daran zu liegen, dass beide Parteien ihren Willen ohne Kompromissbereitschaft durchzusetzen versuchen. Wie sich der einzelne dann verhält (ggf. auch Nachgibt) liegt demzufolge durchaus in dessen freier Entscheidung.

&gt; …die katholische Ehe ist keine rechtliche Ehe

Genau das ist der Punkt. Niemand ist gezwungen zusätzlich zu der staatlichen Ehe auch noch eine kirchenrechtliche Ehe einzugehen, tut er es dennoch, so ist dies seine freie Entscheidung - demzufolge aber auch die Konsequenzen, welche sich daraus ergeben. Wenn nun die Kirche von Scheidung redet, spricht sie von der kirchenrechtlichen Verbindung (weil von Gott gesegnet). Zugegeben, die Argumentationen der Kirchen wirken zuweilen etwas befremdlich, wenn man sich jedoch etwas damit beschäftigt, sind sie durchaus nachvollziehbar.

To acquire a Gun possession license which enables you to buy Category B (see further down) weapons:

* You must be citizen of an EEC county
  
* You must pass a few tests on  proper gun usage and      maintenance as well as gun laws

* You must be 21+

* You can't have a criminal record

* You must be mentally stable and pass a psychological profiling 

* You need to state a justification. Self defence does not count.

People with this license are subject to random police inspections  which happen about twice a year where they check if the gun is stored the right way ( inaccessible for minors,unloaded,locked,ammo stored in separate place). Repeat offenders get their license revoked and their guns confiscated until they reacquire
 the license by passing the tests again.They must also submit to further psychological tests every 5 years or so (not sure).


The second license is a gun carrying license which enables the user to carry a gun in public. 

Those are only issued to policemen and members of the army while in uniform. Hunters have a modified gun carrying license which allows them to transport and carry a rifle in their previously assigned hunting territory during hunting season and only during hunting season. People are however free to transport their gun in an unloaded state to shooting ranges or home.

Guns are split into 4 categories:

Cat A: completely illegal for civilians:

* fully automatic guns

* pump-action  shotguns

* suppressors

* sniper scopes

Cat B: gun possession license required:

* hand-fire weapons

* everything half automatic

* repeating rifles

Cat C: guns acquirable without gun possession license  (age 18+),  need to be registered with the government

* drillings (combination guns)

* double barrelled shotguns

Cat D: misc guns, acquirable without license (age 18+)

* air guns

* soft guns

* guns built before 1871

You change UKIP by Front National, Torries by UMP, Farage by Marine Le Pen and you have France before the 2012 election with absolutely no difference. It's astonishing. ",0,1368381201,null,0,false,0,c9xd9rq,t3_1e6fj8,t1_c9xd9rq,t1_c9x9ytz,null,1431217422,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

But other than financially, it's a lot more practical. If you find reasonable house mates, you tend to become friends after a while. People are a lot more respectful of each others personal space. It's a lot more of ""I won't bother you, and trust you not to bother me"" instead of ""do what you're told because i'm your dad"". There's a lot more freedom in terms of at what times you can make noise, how often you can invite people, etc.

A good student house will have rosters for cleaning and cooking. All other interaction is basically optional, but most of the time people will be pretty sociable. Expenses are evenly split between everyone, and big purchases will need the approval of all (or most) house mates.

At least, this is the way we do it, and I'd take it over living with my parents any day of the year.

It just leaves you so much more freedom and allows you to shape the house in the way you want, as opposed to having to conform to the rules and habits of your parents.

As we know, gypsies mostly play by heart, not by notes, so this effectively pushed them out of business. And since the ""ban"", the tradition of gypsy musicians has, pretty much, died off.

Granted, there are exceptions, there are even a few well-known gypsy bands, but that's a different situation altogether.

I'm glad to say gypsy kids are now generally welcome to learn to play instruments and they're usually pretty talented, but it's quite hard to re-establish a tradition, once it's been rooted out.

So much for the communist regime ""helping them out"".

I highly doubt that. Many of the lighter fission products are efficient neutron catchers, that act back on the operational envelope of the reactor. Right now any claims of ""will last for 30 years"" is pure speculation, because nobody has actual experimental data on the behavior of such an reactor.

Heck, we don't even fully understand the actual effects of fission burn in water moderated reactors; for example the Munich Research Reactor 2 (FRM2) is to be reconfigured to run on MEU. However the original design was done for HEU. About 300m away from the FRM2 there is a heavy ion accelerator, at which currently a lot of experiments are performed to understand MEU fuel burnup in a geometry and neutron flux density as required for the FRM2 operations. Also various fuel compositions are experimentally tested during those beamtimes.

Most of the radioactive waste going around is contaminated material where the actually fissile part makes only a few ppt of the total volume. You can't just dump this into such an reactor.

IIRC most suicides are committed by middle aged and older people, so religious reasons or 'respecting their legacy' would weigh in on how the suicide was recorded. 2) Nordics don't top the list either.

You could say that concern about suicide rates and depression is a ""first world problem"" in the sense that you start paying more attention to it once some of your other issues are solved. Depression and suicides are certainly discussed a lot here and that might contribute to the perception that we have it bad here. I should add that it's also many Finns that keep repeating the stats about the high suicide rates here.

The only other party in the parliament will likely be ATAKA - nationalistic party, which could not support a coalition with DPS. So there are really big chances that no government is formed and new elections take place in autumn.
Besides, more than 25% of votes went for parties that didn't make it above the 4% required minimum, and in the next elections there might be a reshuffle between the parties, with some of them getting together in order to get a higher percentage.

En premier je suis tombé sur cette vidéo Youtube sur reddit qui montre une énorme explosion vraisemblablement proche de Damas. A ce moment on n'en sait quasiment rien. D'après des militaires ce serait une de ces bombes qui ""embrase l'air"". Ce ne sont donc pas de vulgaires petites ""roquettes"" mais bien des armes très lourdes.

Et pourtant on parle de centaine de mort et d'une situation qui pourrait justifié le déclenchement d'une guerre (rumeur insistante de déclaration de guerre par la Syrie durant la nuit) ou embraser une région déjà très fragile.

If there's nothing you can do about it (and many simply don't have a choice), you try not to dwell on it too much. 

It helps that there is no social pressure for you to move out and everyone has friends and family members who live in some sort of family union with other generations. At least 30% of my friends in this age group still live at their parents' home.

I am 35 years old, have higher than average salary for the the most of past 10 years and rent a small apartment (app. 38 m2). My rent and bills eat 45% of my monthly salary. I lived alone even when income was low and housing costs were up to 75% of income and it was considered crazy for doing that by most family members. Considering the sacrifices it took, they're probably right.

Also, outside the bigger cities where parents live in houses and not apartments, many kids will build an additional floor on their family house and live in a separate apartment in the same house. It's not ideal but it's an option that can spare you 30 years of life-crushing loans. That is - if you satisfy the conditions to get a loan in the first place.

Edited: I lived with my parents till I was 23, moved out, moved back in at the age of 25, stayed till 30, moved out again. And if I lose my job and have no choice, I'll move back again.

While living with my family, I saved and traveled abroad 2-3 times a year, with some trips being 2-3 weeks long. In the past 4 years of living alone, I've been on only one 5-day trip.

I cannot speak for the whole of Italy, but where I used to live, my parents would have seen it as a personal failure if I paid the bills, like ""I can't even support my child until she has a proper job, what a shame"". And since they were born in poverty, and providing an education and good living standards was for them a great achievement, this is a big deal.

It does not make any sense, because educationally, it would actually be a great idea. Becoming responsible, etc. But take the fact that there are no jobs for the youth, rent is mental in some places, the fact that parents are just not used to it and see it as a sign of poverty (and loss of face), and you get the picture.

As for co-living, I agree completely. There are so many things you learn (which especially boys in Italy get less chances to learn at home), and much more personal space. It should be a bit awkward for a grown man to bring his girlfriend to his childhood's bedroom, and vice versa. 

I can tell you though that my friends have no choice. They just don't have the money for it, and the value our society gives to ""having your own personal space"" is so little, that it is never worth the extreme sacrifices required, unless you're planning a family.

Pour moi, ces attaques ont lieu dans le contexte d’un débat se déroulant à Washington, concernant la manière dont le gouvernement Obama devrait intensifier sa guerre en Syrie, compte tenu de l’échec de ses forces intermédiaires à renverser le régime syrien. Le NY Times a même dit que la question syrienne était ""la question de politique étrangère la plus urgente du second mandat d’Obama."" 

En ce qui me concerne, je considère les attaques sur la Syrie comme la phase de test pour d'éventuels bombardements américains. Si les responsables américains et européens ont apparemment discuté du lancement d’attaques pour mettre sur pied une zone d’exclusion aérienne, Washington s’est jusque-là retenu de les organiser par crainte des systèmes de défense anti-aériens syriens.

Ces frappes sont justifiées soit par des informations non confirmées, soit par des mensonges éhontés, similaire a ceux qui ont servit pour lancer la guerre impérialiste en Irak ou en Afghanistan. On nous ressert les armes de destructions massives, les armes chimiques, ect...

C'est là ou je trouve l'analyse de Agoravox simpliste, car ce n'est pas justement pour rentrer en confrontation directe avec l'Iran, la Syrie se trouve dans la ligne de mire de Washington depuis plus d’une décennie en raison de ses liens avec l’Iran et des forces telles que le Hezbollah. Avec cette guerre, les Etats-Unis cherchent à mettre en place un protectorat en Syrie qui sera complètement subordonné à la politique américaine, pour contrer l'influence de l'Iran, mais pas du tout pour déclencher une guerre impérialiste contre l'Iran, du moins pas a court terme.

Well, we've now got our own Eurosceptic party, which recently declared that they will try to enter into the Federal elections.

So it'll be interesting to see how this new party, which is on the more conservative end, will influence Merkel's Christian Democrats. 

&gt;Forgot to add that UKIP isn't that much of a danger to the mainstream political stuff in WEstminster as most people see UKIP as more of a protest vote and generally feel better represented by one of the big two or three parties as UKIP appears to be a mostly single issue party

Are you being intentionally rude?

&gt;First of all I feel that it is not a necessary right to be able to carry a concealed firearm and governments are well within the law to suspend this presumed right as it presents the obvious chance of there being a danger to the public.

Ok, firstly, government's can *always* act within the law because they *write* the law. Secondly, on the principle of charity I'm going to assume that you're meaning they're acting morally in prohibiting a thing which can cause a danger to the public. Yes?

&gt;Also can you give me an honest example of when you feel you would need a gun for self-defence purposes when out in public?

I'm not sure I've ever felt the need for it. But I'm [risk aware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory).

&gt;I am pretty sure it is unlikely that you will run into such situations here in the UK because guns are so rare in our society.

Firearms don't only act as defence against other firearms.

&gt;Plus having guns concealed means that there is more paranoia as you don't know who else has a gun.

Why would I be paranoid about other people carrying firearms?

&gt;Surely by your logic deterrence is better than actual confrontation.

I'm not sure what chain of logic if mine you think you've caught onto. Nevertheless the answer is, again, of course. That said actual confrontation sometimes happens and I value my life highly enough that I desire to be able to more effectively protect it.

&gt; Also you wouldn't necessarily need a concealed carry permit if the law were similar to that of Switzerland (as [1] /u/Lokarn already mentioned) if you were just carrying a gun from A to B, when going to gun range.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Surely though it is better to keep the number of guns in public at a bare minimum so such unfortunate events do not occur in the first place.

Not as such. Crimes involving firearms occur regardless of legislation, in fact since we banned most ownership of firearms in 1994 firearm crime has increased dramatically.

&gt;Guns can also make a threatening situation far more serious and you could likely end up shooting someone by using non-proportional force and end up in jail yourself.

I'm an adult, not a baby, so I accept that there are responsibilities associated with life. If one intentionally uses a disproportionate level of force one should expect to be prosecuted for that. That doesn't seem to have any relation to firearms legislation whatsoever though.

&gt;I really do hope that you never do apply for a shotgun license as your reasoning for having a gun is sheer lunacy if you live here in the UK.

You think the desire to defend oneself is lunacy just because the risks of dying are low. This is why Americans think we're nuts. I'm not prepared to say ""Well, if I do get murdered, at least it's all OK and it's fine that I was disallowed from defending myself because it's not going to happen to many other people"".

This nation relies on its relative peacefulness to avoid the awkward problem that we afford our citizens no realistic capability for defence, but I refuse to accept that just because I've got ""good odds"" that that's enough.

&gt;Cat A: completely illegal for civilians:
fully automatic guns
pump-action shotguns
suppressors
sniper scopes

Although in Switzerland it's hard to get a suppressor, you can still buy them by using a special permit issued by the canton. The same applies to laser sights. The rest is completely legal.

&gt;You must be citizen of an EEC county,
You must pass a few tests on proper gun usage and maintenance as well as gun laws,
You must be 21+,
You can't have a criminal record,
You must be mentally stable and pass a psychological profiling,
You need to state a justification. Self defence does not count.

This is where the law is completely different.

In Switzerland it works like this **for semi auto rifles, revolvers and pistols**:

* Be over 18 years old.
* No tests on proper gun usage or maintenance needed.
* Must have a free criminal record.
* No psychological test made at all, but you have to fill in the form saying that you don't have an sorts of mental problems, no idea if they check this out.
* Justification includes: Self Defense, Sports, Combat Shooting, Collector, Killing of small animals, Hunting.

For bolt action rifles and old military issued rifles that work with bolt action:

* be over 18
* Free criminal record

It's easier to get a gun in Switzerland than a fishing permit.

So I believe, that first and foremost for the French, Germans e.t.c. the EU is a political project which brings economic benefit. For the British it's an economic project which has a political price tag that we're forced to pay.

So most pro europeans on this board believe the UK would never leave because it would be too economically damaging. I think, that ultimately we'll leave because the ""political"" price tag of remaining a member will become too great.

Good job handwaving a legitimate argument. 

&gt; Leaving the Eurozone would mean that the country in question is breaking its treaty obligations and thus its EU membership and participation would be frozen.

Well, if 3-5 countries do this at the same time, I can guarantee you that it's not all going to be all about rules and regulations. 

&gt; Lets take for example Greece, the thing is that if other EU countries would be loaning money to it, they wouldn't have any money. That would mean that the Greek state would need to balance their budget right away, meaning more or less shutdown of the state. That is the reality for Greece, they can't change it, nor can pressure other EU countries to just hand them money with no string attached, as they themselves are only in the cutter, not the other EU countries.

This is just silly. Greece should have rejected the money from the get go. If you have enough countries banding together, they can just default on their debts. 

You do not seem to understand what I mean by ""it will lead to conflict"". I mean that the normal state of affairs, i.e. the treaties, the EU laws, the obligations etc will become irrelevant because the countries will stop cooperating with each other.

I fully agree the government is the reason the teachers are in this position. However, I'm looking at the immediate reality: the kids that are about to suffer because their teachers have *chosen* not to be there at the most important time (and they have chosen because they could've chose any other day, but they've chose during exams).

&gt;They want you to see what would happen without them doing their work so you can appreciate its importance. Of course someone will be harmed by them not working, that's the whole point. If a strike has no consequences, then the strikers are either not producing anything of value or are failing to show that they are.

Again I agree. But teachers have a unique responsibility in society that makes their decision to strike at this very moment an irresponsible decision.

&gt;It's just one day. The exam can be moved to a different day.

Then the teachers call a strike for that day too if the government doesn't acquiesce. The quote above this is that strikes are meant to show what would happen if the teachers were not there. Whenever the exam is rescheduled to becomes the next day worth striking on. Again though, reorganising puts the kids under a whole lot of new pressure.

&gt;That's not true either. It's these same kids that will have to deal with larger classes and overworked teachers.

For the purpose of their exams in the short-term, they absolutely have nothing to do with those politics. In the long-term yeah they are involved, but that's not a justifiable reason to strike during the most important week of their academic year.

tl;dr teachers could've chose any day to strike, but they've chose exam week. They are using the kids as pawns for their demands.

paragraph 1: the contract is automatically renewed for another 6 months if you don't send the landlord a ""raccomandata"" (letter with certified timestamp sent from a post office) before 20/05. I highly suggest to do this *now*, if you plan to not stay in Lecce this summer.

par. 2: you all four must pay 4075 euro to the landlady in total for 6 months in 6 installments of 680 euro each. she is right in this case. always ask a payment receipt to avoid future issues.

par. 15: these are the famous ""bollette"" (usually they consist only of tap water, waste collection and common parts cleaning: cooking gas, heating, electricity and phone bills are usually paid directly by the tenant). You have to pay these expenses to the landlady, but separately from the rent installments and only after receiving a copy of the original bills: you can do that because the contract does not regulate this matter. this is usually where a landlord can hope to extract more ""value"" from his tenants . Be vigilant. 

par. 16: this is an ""insurance"" deposit against voluntary and involuntary damages you may make to the estates (pijiama/joint/booze party? :p). it's totally unrelated to the ""bollette"" as in par. 15. The deposit sum should be two times the monthly installment: 1360 euro. No more and no less as interest will not be accrued. Of course you must ask the money back on 20/05 before giving back the keys. You can tell her you stay in the home until she gives back the money in full as her cannot kick you out without a court authorization.

I fully understand that. The difference is I think teaching kids should be an anomaly where that is not allowed. In the UK every year the tube workers strike on Boxing Day. Every fucking year the bastards do it. Why? Because Boxing Day is A) our biggest shopping day (private sector and VAT income) and B) a very important family day. Its their 'best' day to strike. That sucks but all we lose is money and a day with relatives elsewhere in London. Its a very different situation to using kids as tools to get what you want. A similar example is the police. By law they can't strike in the UK. Why? Because of all the shit that would go down without a police force. They are seen as an anomaly too.

&gt;the government could take back their decision in order in order to look at the immediate reality and resolve the situation.

They can strike, just not during exams. Teachers strike in the UK. They don't do it during exams because they realise there are negative externalities and innocent victims of it. They also realise parents will lose tons of sympathy for the teachers because their decision to strike directly fucks up the exam results and future of their kids.

true,CreepyOctopus,LATV,Latvia | Sweden,"Latvia - hard to get guns. 

First you need a permit to purchase a gun. You are disqualified if you have a criminal conviction, are currently charged with an offense or if you've had an administrative infraction within the last year, where an infraction is things like getting a ticket for drunk behaviour. You also need to pass a medical examination that includes a toxicologist and psychiatrist, so you'll be denied if you're seen as mentally unstable or a drug/alcohol addict. You must also undergo training before you get a permit to buy, and obtain a document stating you've demonstrated theoretical and practical knowledge.

Finally, you need a reason to buy a gun - even with all those conditions, they won't sell you a gun just because you want to have one. If you provide self-defense as the reason, you actually have to demonstrate that there's a threat, you probably won't get a permit if it's ""just in case"" self-defense.

All of that only allows you to buy revolvers and semi-automatic pistols no larger than 9mm in caliber. Other than hunting rifles if you're a hunter, you are not allowed to own a more powerful weapon as a private individual.

Personally, I'm happy with those laws. I am not naive enough to think that private gun ownership has no upsides, but I think that overall it does more harm than good and that citizens should not have easy access to weaponry.

As for 3D printing, it will be interesting to see. It's definitely several years until it becomes practical, currently you need a very expensive 3D printer to fully create a gun that won't blow up in your hands. But yeah, 10 years from now with some better printers and their materials I can see reasonable quality guns being printed. Legal response worldwide will be interesting.

EDIT: And for some context in Latvia, population is about 2 million. In 2010, there were 35 911 registered gun owners, the majority being hunters. For self-defense purposes, 12 193 guns were registered and 10 021 had corresponding carry permits.

Even Switzerland has half the gun ownership rate and Norway, a third that of the US which has the highest gun ownership rate of any country in the world at 88.8 firearms per 100 other people.

The countries you refer to are somewhat above the European average:

Il y a des politiques qui méritent d'aller en taule pour des faits commis dans l'exercice de leur fonction et où il y a une véritable nuisance, véritable crime ou véritable délit et où les peines prononcées sont toujours soit légères, soit inexistantes. 

Mais il y a aussi des cas où il est légitime que des représentants de la sphère politique se prononcent et il me semble que les attaques de Guaino contre la partialité du juge Gentil étaient tout à fait fondées et relevaient de la liberté d'expression et non de l'outrage à magistrat, de même que ses propos sur la façon dont ce procès pouvait avoir un impact sur l'image de la France et de la République à l'étranger. Les propos ne sont pas de nature à entraver le fonctionnement de la justice, ils ne se sonts pas produits dans l'enceinte d'un tribunal et dans le but de déstabiliser le magistrat. 

L'outrage à magistrat est un des derniers abus de la loi administrative française et qui permettent à des fonctionnaires de se placer au-dessus des lois dans des circonstances où il peut même y avoir effectivement détournement de la puissance publique à des fins personnelles, politiques, économiques, etc [cf le cas où c'était plutôt la gauche qui s'en prenait plein la tronche](http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20081202.OBS3579/une-petition-reclame-l-abolition-du-delit-d-outrage.html). Guaino n'a rien à perdre et la démocratie tout à gagner à le soutenir. L'outrage à agent est un pouvoir de nuisance de l'Etat contre le citoyen lambda. 

M'enfin l'USM n'a plus rien à perdre, vu qu'il s'agit d'une cohorte de magistrats dont la carrière a piétiné depuis 10 ans de pouvoir de droite et qui se trouvent avoir des pratiques de [chasseurs de tête](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mur_des_cons#Affaire_du_.C2.AB_Mur_des_cons_.C2.BB) plutôt que de garants de la justice dans notre pays.

This is not a competition, simply a discussion where we all hopefully learn more about other countries and systems and understand the map that started it all.

Here's an example from a southern country not shown on the map but with the estimated number of young adults living with parents being as high as in Italy.

We also get net salary that is 50-60% of the total salary paid by the employer (employer pays the taxes directly to the state) and have 25% standard VAT. 

Unemployment is also on the rise, only in Denmark it is around 8% now and in Croatia at 21%.

Comparison of annual earnings and hourly wages by Eurostat shows that the wages in Denmark are 5 times higher.

Comparison of household final consumption expenditure shows prices in Denmark are 42% higher (index 142) and Croatian are 26% cheaper than EU average (index 74).

That still doesn't show what you get for your taxes: in Croatia you get no benefits as a student except that you don't have to pay income taxes (actually, the employer still pays some, but it's less than 17%). Your net hourly student wage is 2-3 euro. You get no subsidies as a student, student loans are a new thing, exist only in commercial banks and have pretty much same conditions as non-student loans (you actually need to be employed), there are no housing benefits unless you are in a dorm (shared rooms only) and there are dorm beds for less than 10% of students in the country.

So yes, in some countries the standard is higher and it is easier to have your own home and live independently.

My gf and i have also been together 1 month so i took her to dinner on the harbor. As we were eating we saw a ship pull up and many sailors walking towards it. At first i was so curious as to why they looked so tiny, i didnt think these could be German sailors.

When we were finished we went out side and saw the Russian flag on the ship and the sailors lined up, so we realized they were obviously Russian cadets (that explains a lot) i began to take photos. i noticed this one lonely sailor all by him self. i decided to take pictures of him and approach him.

We had a nice conversation and his english was very good. BUT THEN i told him i was American, at that moment he froze for a few seconds and looked me dead in the eyes and asked me why i was here. i explained i am living here for work and i am a photographer. He seemed very nervous at this point and i told him it is okay we are not enemies anymore, he then told me he also likes taking pictures and showed me his galaxy 3 phone with much delight and then looked at my DSLR and looked sad saying he can not have a nice camera like mine. A girl came up to us at this point and in russian she asked him if he needed help (as if i was bothering him or something) so we shook hands and i left.

The vessel he is on transports tourists from St Petersburg to many ports across northern europe, the Russians don't put their finest sailors on these vessels :/

The teachers chose independently to strike during exams. It was their decision to strike at this point rather than any other in the year, thus the teachers chose to make their students pawns. Of course this was in reaction to government education policy. But the teachers have also chosen to harm their students, as oppose to striking at any other point. Both parties are causing harm and one cannot scapegoat the other for its actions.

They knew this but they still chose to do it.

The government shouldn't cut education. But they aren't to blame for the teacher's *decision* to call a strike at the worst possible time. Yeah teachers are rightly pissed with the cuts.

Of course it does. But that can be achieved with a strike at any point. Doing so at this point demonstrates it undoubtedly, but it also implicates students to an avoidable and unnecessary level. The teachers are making their point, but also demonstrating a pretty deplorable ethos.

&gt;Do you believe that it's acceptable to bend the law to stop people from striking, even if you don't like the details of their strike?

I agree the government are wrong to do this, at least for teachers. In the UK the police cannot strike by law. I'm fine with that and agree with the rationale (the nature of their job). I don't know if other industries (military, doctors) are allowed. Firefighters did it in the UK in 2002. Some people died early on, but I don't know whether this would've been avoidable had their been a professional service willing to work (not the military).

Both parties deserve criticism. The government's criticism is obvious. The teacher's shouldn't escape freely from taking a decision that harms their students. The most recent teaching strike in the UK avoided exams deliberately. Why? Because doing it then is unfair on the students, who are undoubtedly the most important part of education, and who are always caught in the crossfire between government and teaching unions.

The exam period is the most important part of the student's academic year. School-leavers exams even more so. Teachers should strike at times that avoid the most important part of the *student's* year. Striking will demonstrate their point at anytime of the year, the UK examples and its consequences proves this. But striking during exams also recklessly and needlessly harms students.

The government has shown its willing to deteriorate education and deserves every bit of criticism it gets. Teacher's have also shown they don't care about the students, at least not this year's exam takers.

Both languages have a basis in Latin (much truer for Romanian than English, which is Germanic) and have tons of words borrowed from French. There's actually a list of some of the most spoken languages in terms of how hard they are to learn for an English speaker. Sadly I can only find [this link](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Language_Learning_Difficulty_for_English_Speakers) at the moment, and not the original source.

Considering you're studying politics, I'm sure you'll find the political atmosphere in Romania a lot more interesting than in the UK. The struggle against corruption has been going on for the past 20 years, and things have been improving, but there's still stuff going on continuously.

One day some big businessman, who's also a senator, gets caught money laundering. Two weeks later, the press finds out that he was actually the president's godson, and the president was helping him ship money around. Things like that.

Mind you, that never actually happened, it was a bit of a typical example. I can think of far worse things that actually have happened.

Most Romanians have a pretty good grasp of English (even though the accent is atrocious) so you won't have any trouble getting along there at first. Apart from a few places, you'll find the country cheap as hell. Booze and cigarettes are about a quarter of the prices they are in England, just so you can get an idea. Add to that the fact that Cluj is probably the most interesting city in the country, and that Babeș-Bolyai University has quite a decent quality of teaching.
