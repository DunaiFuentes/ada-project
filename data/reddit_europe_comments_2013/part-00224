The only controversial issues that you may consider extremist involve European society persisting on tried and failed attempts. Such as multiculturalism and austerity. Double standards on a variety of issues. 

Einstein put it simply, the definition of insanity and doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results.

I assign characteristics to countries that assign far worse characteristics to me and my people. And these countries have polls and elections and they chose clearly what their priorities are. These people have, in a rather crude and generalist way I admit, stated clearly what their opinion is of Southern Europeans. And through market behavior, their companies have stated their opinions. Their financial institutions have stated their opinion, through their behavior.

Extraordinary claims they're not. All I said is perfectly sane and founded. Many economists point this out on a regular basis, from left to right. The sheer insanity and continued pursuit of the so called austerity only continues because reason has been thrown out the window and right now we have lobbies dictating policies. And populism and demagoguery are the main tools to win popular support.

For example that by european law, all public services and projects have to be subject to a process where the community has to put up an offer and the cheapest/best solution has to be taken from a selection of free competitors. With the exception that the community can't create a subsection and manage it themselves. The solution has to be taken ""from the market"". At least that's how I understood it. 

That leads to corporate dominance and the introduction of profit oriented thinking into areas that should not be subject to it. Some things are public goods. They should be as cheap and available as possible. That doesn't mean that they should waste money (which is often the argument against commnunity owned services). But they shouldn't be a means to extract money from a community to post as a profit. Also the common practice of choosing the cheapest offer leads to tons of problems where cost estimates turn out to be wrong by a lot, sometimes an order of magnitude.

I like the convenient sides of it but overall it seems pretty disruptive to a working system to me. Also very undemocratic. Very businessy.

Celles des US aussi ! Celles de la France aussi !

&gt;Toutefois, ceci a été obtenu au prix d'une politique économique insoutenable au long terme et qui semble déjà approcher ses limites

Parce que le modèle des US ou du Royaume-Uni est soutenable au lon terme ! Le modèle de ces pays repose sur une dette des ménages deux fois plus élevée que la notre par exemple... Et le Royaume Uni se finance par du quantitative easing à outrance avec une dette des institutions financières égale à 230% du PIB... Endettement toujours plus élevé...

Where exactly does this happen? It's simply not possible to live with such a wage in northern Europe.

People make a big deal about companies in EU countries having to ""prove"" that non-EU citizens hired are better at their job than any other EU citizen.

Edit: To relate all this to the topic the OP raised, there'd be a fair bit of diplomatic bullshit involved in me being allowed to live in the UK, despite the fact that my husband is British. While they'd probably recognize our marriage certificate, there's a slew of rules regarding earnings and employment that are connected to (non-EU) foreign spouses living the UK. We're reasonably well off, so I *think* we'd be okay, but it'd be a headache for sure.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;For example that by european law, all public services and projects have to be subject to a process where the community has to put up an offer and the cheapest/best solution has to be taken from a selection of free competitors.

I don't know how it is in other domains, but in public investments in new buildings/infrastructure as such, the rule here is that everything above 100.000 € iirc needs a contest for ""cheapest solution"". Everything below can be entrusted to whoever the mayor (the local authorities) wants to. So this leads to either projects getting undervalued so that the mayor can entrust the project to whoever he wants, or competitions being rigged (the desired company either underbidding unrealistically, or the other being eliminated on technicalities).

&gt;so the common practice of choosing the cheapest offer leads to tons of problems where cost estimates turn out to be wrong by a lot, sometimes an order of magnitude.

Not only that, but sometimes the cheapest offer is not the best offer for the community. As an architect, trust me, I know.

On the other hand I think this ""lowest offer"" approach can work in certain areas, and especially with big contracts (which was probably the main target), where it makes corruption a bit more difficult.

Si non, pourquoi le chômage est-il une mauvaise chose ?
Si oui, est-ce qu'on peut avoir ce type de travail pour tout le monde ?

Grâce à la productivité des travailleurs occidentaux et à la relative abondance de biens dans les pays riches, non à ta première question (la société ne s'effondre pas par le simple fait que quelqu'un ne travaille pas).

Le chômage n'est jamais qu'une mauvaise chose quand il entraîne des sorties d'argent supplémentaires de la part de ceux qui travaillent et/ou quand il est subi de la part de celui qui le vit.

Quant à la dernière, je ne sais pas si on peut trouver un travail productif pour tout le monde, mais certainement pas par des initiatives gouvernementales en tout cas.

De même qu'il existe des emplois à la con qui ne servent à rien dans les pays où c'est subventionné (ex : employé dans le métro moscovite), il existe des emplois très peu utiles (à part pour assurer de petits services et permettre au travailleur de survivre) dans les pays capitalistes sans SMIC ni filet de protection (ex : ouvreur de porte en Chine, ""greeter"" dans un Walmart dans certains Etats américains). De même qu'une dictature socialiste peut abolir le chômage en faisant creuser tous les chômeurs, un pays capitaliste poussant la logique à fond peut imposer à tout le monde de trouver du travail pour survivre en n'imposant pas de salaire minimum.

La question pour moi n'est donc pas tellement de minimiser le chômage, c'est de trouver un équilibre entre dignité du travailleur (mieux vaut-il être au chômage ou travailler pour moins que le SMIC ? La plupart des Etats occidentaux privilégient le premier choix et c'est un choix qui peut se justifier parfois) et efficience du système économique (poids des subventions et des indemnités de chômage, etc).

&gt; Je disais juste que sous-entendre un lien de causalité entre chômage et ""libre marché""

Nous sommes (en partie) d'accord, ne serait-ce que par le fait que pour moi l'emploi (en particulier s'il est aidé artificiellement et ne dégage pas de valeur réelle) n'est pas l'alpha et l'oméga de toute politique économique.",0,1382617021,null,0,false,0,ccykp0q,t3_1p1go0,t1_ccykp0q,t1_ccykibe,null,1429002061,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

In all these places it is common to have a local language and a national language, people switch between them naturally, depending who they are talking to. In Africa, you have often the situation that there is English or French as the countries official language, then there is an inofficial lingua france (like Swahili) that is spoken with people from other parts of the country, and there is the village or regions traditional language. There was [a thread on r/askscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1ouumb/if_a_toddler_is_learning_two_languages_at_once/) about multilingualism recently, including some reditors experiences in Western Africa (a region I am not familar with).

Ah oui, la prédestination protestante... C'est un long débat mais ce n'est pas la vision catholique, où tu ne mérites rien de ce que tu possèdes, et où il suffit grosso modo de demander pardon à la fin pour aller au Paradis.


&gt;la Bible fait plusieurs fois références au fait que l'homme doit servir Dieu et lui obéir. C'est un choix qu'il s'agit de faire. Tu n'as pas de choix à faire en ce qui concerne la gravité ou tes modes de pensée.

La grosse différence c'est que la Bible considère que la liberté est collective et non individuelle. C'est un mouvement de l'altruisme raisonné : je fais du bien à autrui parce que c'est mieux pour tout le monde, y compris pour moi, mais c'est accessoire. Du coup, pour un individualiste c'est effectivement incompatible avec sa notion très individuelle de liberté.

Enfin, c'est vrai que le texte de l'Ancien Testament parle d'une soumission totale et permanente. C'est très appliqué chez les juifs et les protestants, beaucoup moins dans le catholicisme, qui est avant tout une religion du rituel, avec une dose de Platon et d'Aristote.

Toi et les autres m'avez convaincu.

Of course, many here hate us so much or have so little faith in our abilities that would probably put us in the bottom tier countries. That, my dear redditor, is as xenophobic as it gets. Almost like the caste system in India. We'd never amount to no good.

A lot of economists say otherwise, yes. And they all seem to be in charge or have great influence. But still, doesn't seem to be working thus so far.

Unsustainable crippling interest rates that are equal to odious debt? Irrational, unfounded fears coming from a clearly artificially manipulated market so as to meet certain politic ends? Speculating on the weakest links to undermine a whole project? Being served on a platter to Wall Street and EU sharks by the same institutions that are supposed to shelter and buffer these assaults? Seriously? 

A default would put things in order. Bailouts imply momentary relief but they strain everything further on. Both on national and international level. It gives a very wrong message to the markets. Too big to fail means gross abuse over taxpayers. It's socializing losses while privatizing profits. How this makes any sense to anyone...  that is, other than to those with serious and personal financial interests at play...

I would drop the line today, if I could. If the EU and the IMF didn't have us by the balls. I'd leave the EU and the Euro and tell everyone to go exploit some other poor saps.

Das ist btw exakt falsch :)

Wie erklärst du dir, dass selbst nach der Asylregelung von 1993 die Unterstützung der Asylbewerber in Deutschland tendentiell größer war, als in Schweden?

Und das, wo Schweden doch so viel Asylberwerber hat.

Hier die Leistungen verglichen:

&gt; * Schweden:

Ohne Essen/Sachleistungen:

* ca. 200€ für haushaltsvorstand

* ca. 170€ für Ehegatte/in

* ca. 105 -140€ für Kind 0-18

&gt; * Deutschland:

Ohne Essen/Sachleistungen:

* ca. 354 € haushaltsvorstand

* ca. 318 € Ehegatte/in

* ca. 210-274€ für Kinder von 0-18

Bevor du auf die Idee kommst, das ganze mit den Kosten für den Lebensstandard zu verrechnen: Deutschland und Schweden haben nen ähnlichen Preisindex :)

Kannst höchstens noch von Deutschland ~10% abziehen.

Is halt schon dumm, wenn man anstatt zu recherchieren einfach mal drauf los schwallt. Is aber bei dir ja Regelfall. (Wobei ich immer noch hoffe, dass du ein Troll bist *g)

Und jetzt hör auf, deinen geistigen Unrat auf öffentlichen Flächen abzuladen, grad schonmal anhand eines Fallbeispiels bewiesen, dass es ja nicht so sein kann wie du denkst.

All ideas have some interval when they work and some interval when they don't, so you can take from one or another but not to build a new society, only to fix some actual issues. Just to keep the cash flowing and order on it's place. Left is more likely to implement changes in society by revolution or rapid changes according to a chosen ideology. It doesn't accept hierarchy of any kind and tries to redefine society. 

It's not easy to cast this on the political scene. 'Left' is something useful when you want to gain power, to push rapid changes on some matter and you naivly think that your solution will do all the job. But then again all parties tend to be more 'right' in action when they rule long enough.

You also make it sound as if Europeans are some sort of monolingual hicks, which  is far from true.

I haven't used Riga's airport since they joined Schehgen, but Vienna and Munich definitely have separate Schengen and non-Schengen areas.

In Vienna, gates B, C, and F are for Schengen flights.

In Munich T1, modules A and B are used for Schengen flights.

In Munich T2, level 4 (G gates) is for Schengen flights and level 5 (H gates) is for non-Schengen flights.

Next time pay more attention. Look at the destinations of the flights near yours. Try to walk from where you are to an area with flights that have the opposite Schengen-ness.

&gt;Of course, many here hate us so much or have so little faith in our abilities that would probably put us in the bottom tier countries. That, my dear redditor, is as xenophobic as it gets. Almost like the caste system in India. We'd never amount to no good.

Why cry racism? I didn't bring that up. Just answer my question: why would staying out the EU improve the situation of Portugal?

&gt;Unsustainable crippling interest rates that are equal to odious debt? Irrational, unfounded fears coming from a clearly artificially manipulated market so as to meet certain politic ends? Speculating on the weakest links to undermine a whole project? Being served on a platter to Wall Street and EU sharks by the same institutions that are supposed to shelter and buffer these assaults? Seriously?

How would that be better outside the EU? Interest rates *dropped* for Portugal when joining. The financial markets are still the same for everyone, inside as well as outside.

&gt;A default would put things in order. Bailouts imply momentary relief but they strain everything further on. Both on national and international level. It gives a very wrong message to the markets. Too big to fail means gross abuse over taxpayers. It's socializing losses while privatizing profits. How this makes any sense to anyone... that is, other than to those with serious and personal financial interests at play...

How would a default *not* necessitate the very same austerity?

&gt;I would drop the line today, if I could. If the EU and the IMF didn't have us by the balls. I'd leave the EU and the Euro and tell everyone to go exploit some other poor saps. Unfortunately, our people is conflicted about this. Our politicians and even the media do whatever corporate interests or the bigger countries tell them. It will change due to the growing despair of things. When it does, this now minority view will grow and a secession will occur. What will happen next is a a big unknown. I don't discard being bullied further by the usual big players. Maybe we'll get ""good old democracy"" shoved down our throats.

Your opening argument was this:

&gt;I think the root of the problem is that some Roma abuse their kids by sending them onto the streets to beg for money.

My opinion is that, while some of the Roma do send their kids to the streets to beg for money, this is easily explainable if you look at the social situation those people are living in. Many places in Asia, Latin America and Africa can not replicate this situation because in order for begging to be successful there need to be at least some (but preferably many) rich(er) people you can beg from. It would be stupid to beg in the streets of a country where everyone is poor. That being said, there are a lot of kids begging in the streets of Bogota, Caracas, Delhi and so on...

I understand that your argument is that it is a part of Roma culture to have kids begging. Many people believe that it is so. I think this is a wrong place to start from because you are abusing the term ""culture."" I am not saying that Roma do not behave in this way. They *evidently* do. I am saying that what you describe as Roma culture, I describe as ""being poor and uneducated."" And it is as much part of the Roma culture to be ""poor and uneducated"" as it is part of the Jewish culture to be ""rich and educated.""

Your question is difficult to answer because there are so many aspects to it. I can still try to give you a few pieces of advice or comments but eventually, it really depends on what you want to do.

According to the Bologna Process, the relevant diplomas tend to be licence (3 years), master (5) and PhD (8). That doesn't mean that some well recognised diplomas can't be given at 4,6 etc. but that's something to keep in mind. ""Maîtrise"" doesn't really exist anymore, it's now the first year of a master (Called ""Master 1"")

In theory getting more diplomas should give you better opportunities but you have to pick very carefully. Many diplomas are notorious to not be very useful when finding a job (Art History for instance). You also have to be aware that the executive jobs are largely taken by former students from the ""Grandes Ecoles"", equivalent to a Master, a unique specificity of the French higher education.

Being a foreigner is both a strength and a weakness. The general English level is so low that in this globalised economy, being a native English speaker would obviously offer you by itself many possibilities. Since you seem to have secured a few years in a teaching position, you have the time to study the market, find your niche, maybe obtain a diploma that matters, and get hired at your dream job :)

Or you'll discover that teaching is actually what you've always wanted to do. I wish I could have had English high school teachers who were native speakers. Best of luck in any case.

Right, and everyone going to T2 goes through the same checking, screening and has access to the same shops and bathroom facilities.

This is what you originally stated:
&gt; Passengers arriving and departing on flights to/from non-Schengen countries use different gates, security screening facilities, and once airside, shops, restaurants, lounges, and toilets from those who are going to/from Schengen countries.

It is not true, at most the airport uses different gates for Schengen/non-Schengen.

Hola Sarah,


Si mis suposiciones son ciertas, también has decidido dejar de venir a clase como forma de protesta; lo que hiciste ayer fue algo muy valiente y noble.
Te mantuviste firme a tus principios. ¡Fuiste firme a ellos incluso cuando eras la única que los defendía!


Yo tambien estoy dispuesto a formar parte de una batalla política cuando lo considero apropiado. Hasta llegué a organizar el movimiento 'Occupy' en Brighton. Pero trabajamos hasta no poder más y le perdimos la pista a nuestro objetivo inicial. Al final decidimos disolver la protesta de una forma bastante decepcionante. Fue un día triste, pero que me enseñó algo valioso: debes elegir qué batallas luchar cuidadosamente.


Jonothan Kozol, otro activista y profesor, escribió una vez que hay que elegir aquellas batallas que sean lo suficientemente grandes para importar, pero lo suficientemente pequeñas para poder ser ganadas.


Sarah, tu educación es importante. No la tires por la borda por algo que se dijo una única vez y que no saldrá de entre las paredes del colegio.

  They destroyed the concept of the Euro being a common currency when they froze Cypriot bank accounts and limited Cypriot transfers.  The Euro isn't a common currency anymore if they can do that, it's just pretending to wear the uniform. All the so called 'haven' money still escaped because those accounts were still accessible and unfrozen in London and Moscow, it just royally screwed over Cypriot SMEs when they effectively arrested their private money from their own bank accounts by holding a sword of Damocles over the administrations head which in turn caused a currency flight of outside investment.  You can't arrest accounts and savings of a small businesses without making many of them fold.  It's seismic in its proportions.  

In the last 12 months they've gone from an unemployment rate of 12.3% to 16.9%, the largest increase in the EU.  It's debt as a percentage of GDP has gone up 15% yet they still only have a deficit of a little over 1.1 billion Euros, which in the grand scheme is small potatoes, and for this they broke a country casting a very serious shadow over the whole Euro and Troika.  They took a mallet to a small nut and absolutely smashed it - even robbing it of the prospect of a private recovery package.  A billion Euros is the cost the UK has just accepted by folding to the commissions calls for extra funds from now until December.   A few billion would have been nothing to a syndicate but the way the Troika behaved was to admonish that. 


That's not being pulled out of a hole.  That's being dragged out of the shallow grave you were just forced to dig by your rapist.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;How would not being in the EU prevent this? Would the Greeks be better off if they went into bankrupcy?

If Greece wouldn't be in the EMU there would have been no bailout necessary. Greece would have simply partially defaulted on bonds and inflated its currency like it already did many times in the past.

Yes, the Greeks would've been better off in bankruptcy and out of the Euro. Their industry is not competitive, the Euro currency is too strong for them. They need to be able to devalue to compete on the world markets.

&gt;The citizen benefits from inflation because his debts are shrinking along with the rising prices.

That's a rather naive view.

Inflation causes a multitude of problems:

* **Uncertainty** - if inflation keeps varying, then firms may be reluctant to invest in new plant and equipment as they may be unsure of what the government will do in the future. People also may be uncertain and reluctant to spend. Both of these factors could reduce the long-term level of economic growth.

* **Income redistribution** - many people have to live off fixed incomes, particularly those on pensions. The higher the level of inflation the less their income will be worth. This effect can also happen among people who are working, as their incomes go up either faster or slower than inflation. These effects can arbitrarily redistribute income.

* **Menu costs** - this is a general term for all the inconvenient costs that businesses and individuals face. As prices increase they have to redo their price lists, change price labels, reprint menus and so on. If inflation is constant these costs can mount up.

* **Competitiveness** - if our prices are increasing faster than those in other countries, then our goods will be less competitive and less in demand. This will have a negative effect on the balance of payments.

After birth a nurse will visit the mother and baby at home, check that everything is OK with the child and see how the mother is doing. This is not optional as far as I know.   
These are weekly or bi-weekly visits. After the child is 6 weeks old medical examinations, for the mother and the child, take place at health centers. If something is off, it's spotted early.   
   
However, in 2012 a newborn was killed by his Lithuanian mother  and earlier this year a 5 month old died of SBS. His Polish father is the only suspect.   

edit:   lol, are you offended that the two people that have killed their children in Iceland are not Icelandic nationals.!   Can't be helped.  It is what it is.  
 
The Lithuanian mother that killed her child after delivery, had not gone for prenatal visits at a clinic, so no one knew she was pregnant - not even the father.   
As for the twenty-something Polish father that likely shook his 5 month old daughter 'till she died - if he had problems, he didn't ask for help. And getting help is easy here.

Il y a pour moi derrière cela une réalité biologique : un mâle peut féconder plusieurs femelles. L'inverse n'étant pas possible. Du coup, compétition sexuelle et ""utilité"" différente : un homme dominé est moins utile qu'une femme dominée. 

C'est évidemment inapplicable entièrement à l'humanité, mais ça se traduit dans les chiffres : [10% des femmes n'ont pas eu d'enfants contre 14% des hommes](http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/docs_ffc/ref/fporsoc06g.pdf) (femmes de 46 à 54 ans et hommes âgés de 48 à 56 ans), le phénomène étant aggravé quand tu comptes les individus morts vu que la mortalité est plus importante chez les hommes. 

Parmi les hommes, ceux qui sont dominés ont encore moins de chances d'avoir un enfant. Parmi les femmes, ce sont les cadres et diplômées qui en ont moins, mais on peut croire que ce comportement est en partie désiré, alors qu'il semblerait être subi pour les hommes.

&gt;Et tu refuses de faire une hiérarchie au sein de ces phénomènes mais le fait est que c'est la première cause de mortalité chez les femmes entre 16 et 44 ans en Europe

[Il naît 105 hommes pour 100 femmes](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/detail.asp?ref_id=bilan-demo&amp;reg_id=0&amp;page=donnees-detaillees/bilan-demo/pop_age2b.htm). À 23/24 ans, on se retrouve à l'équilibre. À 55 ans (âge moyen d'un député en début de mandat), plus que 94,5 hommes pour 100 femmes. Si les statistiques de mortalité montrent quelque chose, c'est une écrasante injustice envers les hommes. Ou alors de la compétition plus féroce entre hommes.

La mort est quelque chose de normal pour les hommes. Elle nous suit. Les premières personnes que j'ai vues mourir étaient des hommes. Les premiers amis que j'ai perdus étaient des hommes. Et pourtant il n'y a pas eu de guerre.

&gt;c'est plus largement une domination de certains hommes sur le reste de la société. En cela ça rejoint logiquement la lutte des classes.

Now, it's legal be self-employed working exclusively for a business that puts the production means and the government has approved a lot of social security discounts for self-employed that are starting a *business* for the first time, are under 30, are over 45 and long term unemployed...


A dependent self-employee has a lot of advantages: you don't have to pay sick days, you can fire them when they are pregnant, can be fired for free for forever... 


Besides that with the last Social security reasons you have more flexibility with the social security. Paying a net minimum wage of  704.50^1 euros/month( after Social security and public unemployment insurance) cost for an employer 982.62 euros The minimum cost is 224.5 euros for that.


A self-employed can pay a minimum of 90 euros in the first six months. And 180-245 euros/month in many situations whatever they earn 700 euros/month or 3000 euros.

Il y a donc un lien logique que je réfute. Un système qui serait la cause inégalités H/F en quelque sorte, pour caricaturer.

Je ne vois que des manifestations différentes d'un même phénomène chez les hommes et les femmes. Le lien logique n'est pas du tout le même, par exemple :

                       --&gt; verbale / sexuelle (chez les femmes)

Et on peut faire pareil pour toutes les manifestations que tu relies avec le patriarcat (les inégalités dans l'accès aux postes de décisions à la fois dans la sphère politique et économique)

Au passage, [les inégalités de salaires entre sexes sont de l'ordre de 6 à 7 %](http://www.inegalites.fr/spip.php?article972), soit autant que la variabilité entre individus sans tenir compte du sexe.

&gt;j'ai l'impression que pour toi les causes sont avant tout biologiques (déterminisme social) alors que pour moi c'est la culture qui joue le plus (la consommation en fait partie).

Oui, mais le ""plus ou moins"" est un jugement de valeur donc on ne pourra pas être d'accord. Retenir que je ne nie pas l'importance du culturel. Je nie son importance relative vis à vis de critères physiques qui privilégie un sexe à un certain moment, un autre à un autre moment. Au total, si on prend en compte tous les critères de la vie et leur importance relative, la somme des inégalités ne favorise pas les hommes.

My husband was born in 1961 in Jaen.  As a result of the Civil War, he only got a 6th grade education, and that via the Catholic church, so more like a fascist indoctrination.   He is illiterate in his mother tongue, has never read a book, can't read a newspaper and is ignorant of many, many things that we here in the US (and the now educated generations of Spain) take as common knowledge.  He didn't get good medical care as a child in Spain, or even as a young man.  From what little he has told me about his childhood, he suffered symptoms of malnutrition.  His mother had 10 children, three of whom died as infants or toddlers.  That was probably pretty indicative of the infant mortality rate then.

Like tens of thousands of kids from that era, he went to work full time after leaving school in the 6th grade.  His family were migrant farm workers.  (My b-i-l worked a man's work since the second grade!)  At age 14, my husband left his village in Andalusia and walked--walked!--to Madrid to look for work.  

I met and married my husband in Madrid in 1981.  When we went to his village to visit family, the village still had no paved road, no water.  They had some electricity, but no telephone.  The family home had no bathroom.  Few did there at that time.  Everyone was illiterate.  There was no work to be had.

That's the legacy of the Civil War. 

My husband doesn't know much of what went on there during the war, who was killed, who was responsible for local murders, if he had family who died.  No one talked about it and you didn't dare ask about it.  Because neighbors were involved, and other people still living around there committed atrocities, thefts and other crimes.

 But maybe 10 or 15 years after that, the younger generation began to ask lots of questions and some of the older folks began to talk a bit.  We have a friend from a village near Sevilla.  She told us how So-And-So---a decent man from her village--was chased into a tall field by some local men who were fascists.  Really, they were thugs, or had a personal bone to pick with this man.  They couldn't find him and he wouldn't come out, so they set the field on fire.  When he ran out, they grabbed him and cut his balls off.  In telling this story, our friend named names.  Some of those people were still living and their children and grandchildren carried the shame of their fathers and the contempt of the villagers.  

Most Spaniards haven't forgotten about this stuff.  The young people have been learning about it for a few years now.  

When I was in Madrid in 1981, I was staying in a youth hostel on the Calle del Prado (near the Plaza Sta. Ana) only a couple of blocks away from the parliament building.  I was there when the attempted coup took place and also saw the demonstration some days later in support of the King and democracy.  It was huge, to say the least.  One of Madrid's biggest in their history.  I really don't think that Spaniards will choose to return to fascism and once again roll back the clock and return to a feudal system.",0,1382634411,null,0,false,0,ccyqjsi,t3_1oyqzh,t1_ccyqjsi,t1_ccxixlq,null,1428999259,3,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,3

Allora allora, l'idea di Nuovo Corviale o delle Vele non è di perse sbagliata, esistono tantissimi esempi di strutture residenziali anche più grandi, vedi Karl Marx-Hof, il problema sta nella collocazione e nel mix insediato.

Allora dovete pensare che esiste una cosa chiamata invidia, bene l'invidia secondo gli urbanisti del 1800 era la forza cardine per cui una persona poteva elevarsi socialmente ed economicamente, l'idea era che creando grandi strutture era possibile destinarle ad un maggior mix sociale così che i ""poveri"" vedessero i ""ricchi"" e quindi fossero spronati a raggiungere il loro stesso ""status""...sembra una scemenza ma funziona quasi sempre.

Quindi il problema si crea quando queste enormi strutture vengono riempite di persone dello stesso ceto sociale, e magari con qualche delinquente:

Lunghi corridoi, coorti chiuse con due ingressi, pochi ingressi, un unica strada di ingresso, pochi servizi chiaramente abbandonati con l'aumentare della delinquenza ecco lì la ricetta per far nascere il degrado.

true,AntonioPussInBandera,null,null,"Well my great grandfather was an army medic who had served in Cuba, so he taught my grandmother to write and read and math, who in turn taught her children, but other then that they only had schooling until 12 or so. My fathers side however had all of them study with my father finishing bachillerato and going to study in coruna for naval studies, which was a big deal at the time. My parents don't have many suffering stories from the war, just food shortages and what not, but my grandmother has more. My great grandfather being army medic had a rifle and brought it home with him after the war. He had to bury it in a field behind the house because guns weren't allowed, one day two guards arrived and told him that he had to follow them. Everyone who saw this immediately assumed he was dead, as it was common for people to be picked up like this and executed. However, they went to a bar down the street and spoke with a higher up and he came back fine. Also my grandma remembers going to Santiago on the bus and seeing three bodies in a ditch along the road. 
They still have rather good thoughts about the past because it's the way it is, we always remember the past being better than it was. Also they don't know the reason there were food shortages was because of Franco's closed trade policy or anything of that sort, they thought it was because of a war. They saw what they perceived as good, new infrastructure and safety. But didn't know to blame the bad on Franco instead it was just seen as hard times.

I see your point, but Israel is a terrible example.

Israel and the US are separated by the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Having 28 neighbouring countries fuse together is different. There was a geostrategic element that we should keep in mind when talking about the European integration.

If anything, this shows that countries don't have the same interests or views on the world just because they're neighbours, which goes against the European doxa.

&gt; At least until France and the UK (through Bruxelles) guaranty a similar level of protection.

This would be an interesting discussion. Eastern Europe has understandably all the rights to feel a certain way about what was the USSR, but I'm really tired of seeing this subreddit stuck in a Cold War mentality.  

Russia, far from being a perfect democracy (but not unlike the US or EU memberstates who have their own issues for that matter), is not the USSR, and just as we need someone to criticize Russia, we need Russia to criticize the US' fascist excesses. Someone should remind the world when international law is held in contempt, just as France did in the 60s'.

I'm not here to defend Assad, but if one looks at the international law, Putin upheld the law while the Obama administration's bellicist attitude breached it.

&gt; But what if I don't want to apply the rules of my country in my region?

I see what you did there, and it's a weak argument. Eurosceptics are labeled as 'populists' (whatever that means), if not right-wing extremists (although some of them are). Serious and moderate EU opponents that can really change the public opinion don't seem to exist because the enslaved media never, ever talk about them.

When a system can't be critized, mafias appear. That's what happened to the USSR with the Brezhnev's clan for example. How can you criticize the EU when the EU is 'a paragon of Peace'?

Nein, jetzt wo es kein Geld mehr zu verteilen gibt begehren die Katalanen auf? Das steht in dem Artikel?  

&gt;Tatsache ist, dass die Einnahmen der Regionen seither drastisch eingebrochen sind. Das Schicksal Kataloniens unterscheidet sich da kaum von dem der benachbarten Landstriche. Gleichzeitig aber haben die Regionen hohe Ausgaben zu tätigen. Sie sind verantwortlich für die Bereiche Bildung, Gesundheit und soziale Dienste, die rund 75 Prozent ihrer Budgets verschlingen.

Austerity vom Feinsten, dank Bankenkrise und Politik von Frau Merkel.

&gt;Immer mehr Einwohner in Katalonien glauben inzwischen, als eigenständige Nation künftig eher zu prosperieren als in einer ohnehin schwierigen Ehe mit dem nun auch noch wirtschaftlich angeschlagenen Spanien. Mit den Transferleistungen, so wird immer wieder geklagt, würden ärmere Landstriche gestützt, während man in der eigenen Region die Sozialleistungen kürzen müsse.

Sparen, sparen! Für die Banken, por favor, sparen!

&gt;In der Vergangenheit hatte die Zentralregierung die Wünsche und Nöte der einzelnen Regionen stets durch das Aufbieten zusätzlicher Gelder zu stillen vermocht. Noch 2009, bei der letzten Aktualisierung des Finanz-Paktes, waren zu diesem Zweck 11 Milliarden Euro zusätzlich bereitgestellt worden. Diese Mittel stehen dem Staat nun, in Zeiten einer hartnäckigen Rezession, nicht mehr zur Verfügung.

Der Staat hat also dank Bankenkrise kein Geld mehr? Da bleibt nur ... SPAREN! Für die Banken, für wen sonst?

&gt;**Gleichzeitig aber hat die Krise und der Streit um die regionale Finanzierung die politischen Spannungen im Land wachsen lassen.**

Hola Sarah,

Si no me equivoco tú también has hecho huelga al no ir a clase; lo de ayer fue algo muy noble y valiente por tu parte. Diste la cara por tus principios, aunque fueses la única.

Yo también tiendo a unirme a batallas políticas cuando lo considero oportuno. Incluso ayudé a organizar el movimiento ""Occupy"" en Brighton, nos dejamos la piel pero perdimos de vista el objetivo. Al final decidimos suspender la protesta de una forma bastante anti-climática. Fue un día deprimente pero me enseñó una lección muy valiosa: elige tus batallas con sabiduría.

Jonothan Kozol, un compañero activista y profesor, escribió que debes elegir batallas lo suficientemente grandes como para que sean relevantes pero lo suficientemente pequeñas como para que sea posible ganar.

Sarah, tu educación es importante. No la eches a perder por una declaración de principios que hiciste en una ocasión y que no va a tener trascendencia más allá de los pasillos de esta escuela.

1. Die EU ist daran schuld, dass es eine katalanische Autonomiebewegung gibt.

2. Die EU führt zu Spaltung statt zu Einigung in Konflikten wie dem der bereits zwischen der spanischen Regierung und der katalanischen Autonomiebewegung bestand.

So. Selbst wenn man nun eine Menge Fantasie aufbringt bekommt man es nicht hin ersteres da rauszulesen. Das funktioniert nur wenn man rein gar nichts begriffen hat.

Dies ist dem grenzdebilen /u/Guedado aber dennoch irgendwie gelungen, er antwortet darauf:

To date the only society to have achieved (an albeit very controversial) full employment is the Soviet Union (maybe a few other Communist societies managed it, though again there's a lot of controversy over it). One of the major reasons for that is by forcing people down certain career paths. The EU or any modern society won't do that as it doesn't seek to be so dictatorial and it values the individual far more that the USSR ever did.

One way or the other, the only proof that exists for anything, is the assertion that after recent events the opinions of a 7% of the survey sample state (and not necessarily truly * ) that their opinion of GD has risen after *recent events*.

That recent event is factually, not just the murder, but also the prosecution of GD. I'm not sure why you even bring the pogroms up as a revelation. It definitely is not. It is well known that GD targets immigrants, and it has been on TV several times.

Therefore, to state that ""7% of the population view the assassinations and pogroms positively"" is invalid, because that statistical sample didn't answer that question at all.

You are assuming that every single GDer accepts that the murder was ordered from high in the hierarchy, which is a pretty big leap to make.

That's not really true. The extent of bad press GD got for this rose exponentially after the recent murder. The only people who said ""nothing new was revealed"" were the leftists.

Yes. Phones have many variables which prevent them from working, but usually there is a way around the problem. Google is your friend.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;statistics that actually show ""Roma commit more crime than Kurds or Swedes"". From there you can try to discuss why we think that is happening


Well, the short answer if you want statistics between ethnic groups, then you don't. That is very, very frustrating (to me as a science person). The long answer is however, you kind of do anyway.

For example, Skolverket (the school authorithies) have been forced to make studies on why Roma children have such enormous high non attendance and why they perform so badly in school. Also, several other studies have been made on why they don't go to school.  Romas do not like being registrated, but studies have been made with the Romas, or introduction by the Romas. I don't think any other group has that poor attendance record, it is extremely unique. Nor are they that unwilling to cooperate with anyone non Roma. And there are the Kurdish association, the Somalii association etc. The only other one that has even remotely that problem, is perhaps the Somalii. But if you look at the Kurdish association or look at school studies made over the Kurds, they are nowhere close to the problems that the Romas have. So, in that sense you can see it. But, if you want a record of ""Romas who graduated in 2003"" you are right, there is none. However, in comparisons one can still see it. 

Also, in the interviews made for the academic studies, there is often the mention of a deep mistrust against ""the majority society"" in a way you may find in some families otherwise but not in the whole group.The Kurds as a whole do not deeply mistrust the Swedish society.  


Also, it is something the Romas themselves bring up some time. Just like the Kurds might bring up the question of honour killings, the Romas bring forth the question of lack of schooling or criminality. So, if you compare the issues that concerns the Kurds, people who were just as badly treated and illiterate 35 years after they started coming to Sweden, it is not the same as the issues concerning the Romas. The Kurds have better education, ministers, interact with society etc. Not that there are not issues,but not *only* issues. 


It is the same if you look at studies made about unemplyment etc. You have to go around it a bit, but it is still clear if you make a comparison.

Just like we have no statistic about honour killings between groups you hardly have to be a statician to know that it is far more common among Kurds, than Ethiopians (where I haven't heard about it really, but not saying it has never happened). Do we have that statistic comparing those two groups? No, of course not. Do we still know there is a huge difference - yes we do. Ethiopian girls don't gt murdered by their parents/uncles, nor do they seek help from authorithies in  droves. And, it is not something the academia has discovered in interviews either, nor is it mentioned by grown Ethiopians. So, yes, with big certainty we can say, that honour killings is far more common among Kurds. 

So, the information can be found really, but one just has to work around it a bit.  ",0,1382683823,null,0,false,0,ccz8cf3,t3_1p2f0o,t1_ccz8cf3,t1_ccz7ztk,null,1428990665,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm quoting you, emphasis is mine. It's not my argument. I'm saying the EU treaties contributed to the situation, not that they're the sole cause. Your argument is a strawman.

&gt; Yes and I pointed out that that leaves you no where because of how the WTO is structured and you would be alone when it came to dispute settlement. You haven't countered that.

You haven't explained why Austria or Slovakia would be alone. You can make joint complaints to the WTO. Why wouldn't they be able to group up with countries that have the same interests on a specific matter ? 

The WTO has its flaws, just as the UN has, when it comes to punish the powerful. You don't necessarily have to be in the EU to survive, how does the rest of the world makes it ? Certainly not by joining a supranational organisation as the EU

Going back to the example I mentioned earlier, with the English comissioner and the textile market...I would understand the French if they wanted to leave the Union as the example showed:

1. They're not sovereign (They don't have much power over that comissioner)

2. The system is not democratic (They never would have voted for an official that acts this way)


3. This system goes against their interests (which is to keep their textile market)

&gt; You're position is so terribly argued I have no idea what you're saying. 

That's not surprising, you lack reading comprehension as shown at the top of this reply.

I find it very strange that you point to uncertainty as a problem... while turning to *defaults* as a better solution.

One of the things that struck me when reading some of the opinions of the Estonian public was that they support the system completely. Someone had asked whether or not they felt less safe with most of their public records on a computer system, and *everyone* said they felt safer. One reason given is that, because of their history with the Soviet Union, they like knowing exactly who accesses their records, when they were accessed and where they were accessed from. They have a deep mistrust of paper records because anyone could be looking at that behind closed doors. Two of the examples given were a politician a few years ago who was looking up sensitive information about some of his constituents. The system logged his views and he was caught and arrested. The other example was a policewoman who was stalking her ex-boyfriend. Again, the record of her viewing his personal information was logged, and she was caught and dismissed/arrested. 

With the increasing interest in data protection in the EU, I can help but think that this is the future of privacy - a system that gives people control over the information their government holds on them.

Trams are able to use space much more efficient and in contrast to cars, they neither cause pollution nor noise. Spaces are scarce means in towns. I can not see the problem with reducing the space, that is given to cars - a form of mobility that drags the quality of living in cities so far down- in order to to increase the quality of living. If we look at photos from the beginning of the last century, we can see, that streets offered more than 10% of the space to pedestrians, there used to be more green, urban spaces were designed to be used, not to be passed or occupied by one ton of metal per 10 m². In the case of Paris, the Modal Split indicates, that cars are only used for 6% of the ways in the town. 80% of the street spaces are given to 6% of the total traffic.

I think that Franco kidnapped Spanish identity and even Spanish History. He used the propaganda and Education System to make people think that his regime was the truly manifestation of the Spanish tradition, and that he was another link of the ""*Spain as a unity of destiny in the universal*"" (España como unidad de destino en lo universal) that supposedly meant that the fate of Spain was to Christianize the world and remain like some kind of moral stronghold. Suddenly, Franco was represented as [El Cid Campeador](http://i.imgur.com/bji1YQQ.jpg) (NSFW?) at the same time that they tried to identify in the old Spanish heroes any characteristic that ""proved"" their affinities with the Regime. Suddenly The Catholic Kings, El Cid, Hernán Cortés, Pizarro, the Visigothic Kings... all *were* National-Catholics, so Franco's Dictatorship was somehow ""justified"" (note: of course I disagree, I'm talking about their point of view).

Then, Franco dies, Juan Carlos is proclaimed king, the transition to democracy happens and the kids that studied in Spanish schools during the dictatorship have children. There is a natural reaction against the bullshit that they listened in school when they were kids, but instead of *cleaning* the Spanish History and identity from Franco's influence, they just hide the sensitive topics under the rug. The Catholic Kings, El Cid et al. are still regarded as fascist. The Spanish Nationalism is still fascist, even the flag (used by Carlos IV) and the Spanish Anthem are fascist only because they aren't the Republican Flag and Anthem. Juan Carlos I is also regarded as illegitimate by some people because he was designated as his successor by Franco, despite that the [Spanish Republican Government in Exile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Republican_government_in_exile) accepted him as legitimate after the Transition to Democracy.

At the same time that the Spanish Nationalism suffered from shame after Franco (""if you like Spain you **must** like Franco, so better don't like Spain or you'll be called fascist""), other Nationalisms like the Catalan or Basque flourished. They didn't have the ""fascist stigma"" that makes people think that any form of Spanish Nationalism must be related to fascism, and they have the right to be upset with those who repressed them, although lately there are performing an historical revisionism that is far manipulative in my opinion (for example The Crown of Aragon wasn't the ""Catalo-Aragonese Crown"" and the Spanish Succession war wasn't about Catalan independence). So we have two trends at the same time: one Spanish Nationalism kidnapped by Franco that is going down, and several Nationalisms that are going up thanks to the efforts of some persons who cares about their people.

Franco's ideology also succeeded in making people think that any form of Republic is leftist. Most people in Spain still think that if you aren't left-winged you can't want a Republic. This is a shame, because if there were enough republican parties in Spain from different ideologies they could get enough votes in the General Elections to GTFO the King. I'd love it if Spain was a secular republic, but for some people, if you want that you have necessarily to burn pictures of the King and call the Pope a child molester.

I think that one can be Spanish Nationalist without being fascist. The nationalism isn't only about  saying ""how awesome we are"" but also ""how can we fix this mess"". The liberals from the 19th Century were nationalists, as well as the ""[Regeneracionistas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerationism)"", the 98 Generation, some of the II Republic leaders. Hell, even the Republican Anthem is quite nationalistic: *""De nuestros acentos el Orbe se admire y en nosotros mire los Hijos del Cid""* (~The orb shall admire our accents and see us as the sons of El Cid). It's awful that nowadays the Spanish Nationalism seems to mean sunglasses, thin mustaches and raised arms. I think there's still a chance to ""fix this mess"", but this isn't going to happen until we stop thinking about clichés and revenge.

true,Keytard,CANA,Frankfurt,"I totally agree that the US spying program is completely insane and that Germany in particular should work to ensure their privacy. However, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is a completely different issue. Let's not confuse them.

Let's go over that issue with a few key points.

1. This is probably the most important so I will put it in bold letters. **The US has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.** They have, however, not ratified the whole thing. The United States has signed and ratified two of the optional protocols to the Convention, the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.

2. The US played a huge role in writing the treaty and 3 of the provisions are basically a cut and paste from the US constitution. 

3. The reason that they haven't ratified it is not that they are afraid it will affect their ability to execute kids ([Saudi Arabia has signed and ratified it with the lovely exception that notes Islamic law comes first. They execute kids just fine.](http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/01/28/saudi-arabia-follow-un-call-end-juvenile-death-penalty)). The reason is that the ratification process for the US government, like all US government processes, is really stupid. For an explanation I'll quote from [UNICEF](http://www.unicefusa.org/campaigns/public-policy-advocacy/the-convention-on-the-rights.html) so that you can see why no government will ever be able to get this thing passed (no matter the party in charge)
&gt;In the United States, agreeing to a treaty requires several steps. First the President or a designated representative needs to sign the treaty; then the President submits the treaty to the U.S. Senate with explanations and interpretations of the treaty’s provisions. The Senate must approve the treaty, or give its ""advice and consent,"" by two-thirds majority. Only after that can the President formally ratify the treaty.

4. The actual ideological reasons why some Americans don't want to ratify this are not nearly as bad as people seeking donations would like you to think they are. It's basically four main arguments: 

* American laws should be made exclusively by America's elected representatives
* The most important clauses of this Convention (the ones that cover child soldiers and the sexual exploitation of children) are ""optional"" have already been both signed and ratified by the American government
* As with most UN declarations and conventions this one is completely undone by having countries who make liberal and unapologetic use of child soldiers (Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Burma/Myanmar, Iraq, Lebanon, Nepal, The Philippines, Yemen, Bolivia, Colombia, Haiti, to name a few), and countries where child sex trafficking is shockingly common (Tanzania, Brazil, El Salvador, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam) sign and ratify the document.
* America already has laws addressing these problems. In particular the sexual exploitation of children. This is arguably the only problem addressed by the Convention which exists in America. American law makers and police forces already work hard at addressing this problem and protecting children. (this is kind of an add on to point two, but it does matter)

While there is absolutely room to criticize America's efforts and laws to protect children, signing this Convention is pretty ridiculous. In countries like Germany or Belgium where children were already protected signing and ratifying this convention didn't make them any more or less protected. In countries where children are victimized in many ways like The Philippines or Rwanda signing and ratifying this convention didn't make them any more or less protected.

While the UN is important and I think these conventions can be helpful it's important to remember where real change comes from. Real change in a country really only comes from the people and law makers who live there make it happen. 

Mostly I think that pretending this has anything to do with healthcare for Ariana-Leilani is super dishonest. It's a way to score political points over a tragedy.

She does reside in America though and her mother lost any custody rights in a court case decided by a Juvenile and Domestic Relations (JDR) Court in Arlington, Virginia.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"Freer trade is great, and I support the increase in FTAs. But there are many problems with them, they should never be considered as an absolute good or not open to abuse.  

Take the Boeing-Airbus spat. In '92 the US unilaterally withdrew from an agreement with the EU on how to handle Large Civil Aircraft (LCA) trade and subsidisation, an agreement that was supposed to stabilise market share for the respective aircraft manufacturers.  Airbus had been slowly taking on market share up to 92 (and beyond) to the point that the US decided that liberalized trade wasn't in their interest and cancelled the deal. A short time later, the Uruguay round went into effect creating the WTO which prompted the US to take the EU to court for illegal LCA subsidies on multiple occasions (the EU always countersued, pretty much a day later - it seems they always were prepared but never wanted to take the first shot). Both eventually won parts of their cases, and the process repeated a couple of times. WTO laws when it comes to dispute resolution require an outcome in a relatively short time (around 12-18 months is the longest it can take, depending on appeal, if I recall correctly - forgive me, I'm not at home so don't have access to all my old notes). The complexity involved in the case made the short timeframe woefully insufficient for full comprehension to deal with the myriad claims involved, it was a good old fashioned exercise in flinging shit at the wall and seeing what sticks. I browsed through one of the documents that involved suggestions and recommendations from supporting WTO members, and it was more than a thousand pages of disjointed legalese full of advising member opinion, notes, etc.
 
The problem on the side of the EU was, though, that the Pentagon pretty much implicitly subsidized Boeing which the EU couldn't do with EADS (Airbus' parent company) due to the different way that military procurement occurs in the two areas. This was particularly evident with the mid air refuelling aircraft contract that was started in the early 2000s, worth about a hundred billion dollars. Boeing initially won the deal, but an ethics scandal involving Boeing bigwigs and Air Force personal scuppered the deal. Following a renewed round of bidding, EADS won the contract to work together with an American company, Northrop-Grumman, with the major winning factor being increased fuel capacity. Analysts said that EADS was the clear winner. Boeing immediately launched a massive public relations and lobbying campaign about American jobs, and sent a number of protest points to the US government calling for a re-tender. This was eventually accepted, and this time Northrop-Grumman pulled out of the partnership for the bidding (interestingly, the timing coincided with a change of leadership in Northropp-Grumman). EADS soon followed suit, claiming that the new terms of the tender were designed to clearly favour Boeing by having the planes be smaller. Most industry analysts were shocked by the decision, and following a meeting between Sarkozy and Obama, the tender offer was extended by 60 days. EADS once again lost, and didn't contest because they said it was clear that there was overwhelming political  pressure  to award the contract to Boeing, as well as flagrant institutional bias towards that outcome. Winning the original bid due to fuel capacity, but then losing because they wanted smaller planes? Doesn't seem to make a great deal of sense. 

Then there's the frequent steel trade spats the EU has had with the US. The EU has taken the US to court multiple times on the issue of steel, beginning in 2000 when they found that the US was unfairly distributing proceeds from countervailing tariffs to companies that filed the claims in the first place, effectively subsidizing the US steel industry. The EU won on this occasion... And the next, and the next, and the next, all to do with how the US calculated those countervailing duties and distributed them to steel companies. In 2002, when Bush Jr was seeking to get a vote passed in congress to fast track the signing of FTAs (ha!), he imposed illegal tariffs on steel of 30% to help out a few wavering congressmen (the US steel industry had been ailing for some time). The EU took them to court, after imposing illegal tariffs on steel in retaliation themselves, and won of course. But for more than a year those tariffs were in effect, and Bush jr won the vote in congress by one.

And that's just on some of the shady actions governments take on this stuff. Unilaterally withdrawing suddenly, favouring domestic companies, illegally imposing tariffs. The US can do that because it's one of the world largest economies. Imagine if they acted like that with respect to Ghana or Papua New Guinea, they wouldn't have a chance. As part of a larger trading bloc, however, they have far more leverage and capability to withstand bullying. It's one of the reasons I'm so big a supporter of the EU. With the seeming death of the Doha round (it's alive, but there's no political will to spend on pushing it through), you need to be a big fish or you can be eaten by one at any time.

* strategic relations and political blocks (that's why you need a visa when travelling to Russia, but someone from Belarus doesn't, Latvian citizens are 'sub-par people' in this case)

* potential revenue from incoming tourists (Russians constitute a large part of tourists in Turkey, so they don't need a visa to enter, but Americans have to pay for it, American citizens are 'sub-par people' in this case)

* breaches in visa regime: overstaying and illegal immigration (that's the reason Canadians reintroduced visa regime for Czechs and keep it for Romanians, while Latvians can enter Canada freely, Czech and Romanian citizens *were* 'sub-par people' in this case)

It seems that the Czech managed to bully Canada into lifting the visa regime silently, while Romanians are trying to do the same in more open and loud way.

Why are Czech and Romanian citizens treated differently? Why Romanians are 'sub-par people'? Answer is that the Czech were more successful in blackmailing Canada. Does Canada have the right decide on its immigration policy? Sure. Is this fair to Romanian people? Definitely, no.

Even though I agree more or less with your full comment, I think maybe this line in particular is misguided (either that or I read it wrong). Catalonia and Euskadi acquired autonomic status during the II republic, and Galicia had it aproved by the republican government near the end of the war, but did not have time to apply it.

What I am trying to say is that you seem to believe regional nationalisms emerged *after* Franco, while I think they have their origins around the XIX century. During Franco's regime, of course, regional nationalisms were strongly prosecuted to the point of invisibility, and that is where I guess comes the common believe that these movements emerged in the 70s.

I know more details about Galicia, so I will use it an example, but I consider that Catalonia and Euskadi must have been through a similar process. Just as you point out, XIX intelectuals favored nationalism. But you seem to believe that only the Spanish nationalism was subject of their favor. In fact, late nineteenth intellectuals in Galicia held considerable debate about identity. Some, like Manuel Murguía, Eduardo Pondal, etc... strongly defended Galician nationalism, while others such as Emila Pardo Bazán identified themselves with the Spanish nationalism narrative and mocked Galician nationalism.

Later, begining the 20th century, intellectual debate influenced politics and we got in the II republic the two trends that still prevail nowadays: some galician politicians, like Alfonso Daniel Rodríguez Castelao (also intellectual), belong to nationalist parties and defended in parlament a federal organization of the republic; while others, like Franco, viewed Galician as a threat to Spanish nationalism.

TLDR: All nationalisms in Spain emerged in the XIX century, but Franco made regional nationalisms invisible for forty years and that is why some people, like you seem to believe Catalan/Basque nationalisms were invented in the 70s.",0,1382710024,null,0,false,0,cczcqen,t3_1p6c05,t1_cczcqen,t1_ccza18g,null,1428988618,2,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,2

true,Gedat,NETH,The Netherlands,"When you put on an SS uniform (in Holland especially), it isn't clear at all that there's no intent of racism. What does become clear is that you're being disrespectful and chose a rather inconsiderate way to represent your political beliefs. The Zwarte Piet character has no relation to any of that; in the public eye he's just Sinterklaas his servant who happens to be Moor. Therefore, dressing up as Zwarte Piet is as offensive as dressing up as your favorite comic book character.

Perhaps a better comparison to illustrate the point I tried to make is the one between wearing a Zwarte Piet uniform and wearing Blackface. With the Zwarte Piet character there wasn't any intent of creating an offensive racial stereotype, let alone create a representation of slavery. After all, in Holland, it would make more sense for the character to be of Indonesian descent if this were the case. Perhaps his character originated as a Moor in order to scare children into thinking he would take you away if you misbehaved, but there's no confirmed reason as to why exactly Zwarte Piet is black, which is probably because there isn't one. As far as most people are concerned, Zwarte Piet is Sinterklaas his *servant* that according to an old children's book simply happens to be a Moor because they lived in Spain and it would make for a pretty distinguishable character. 

Wearing blackface, however, while bearing similarity to the Zwarte Piet character in facial make-up, has completely different origins. Instead of originating from a children's book as a character that simply happens to be black, it originated as a theatric, exaggerated racial stereotype of an African slave worker.
