L'adage, c'est que les Etats-Unis ont 20 ans d'avance.

&gt;J'ai du mal à voir la différence entre un couple hétéro infertile et un couple lesbien.

Je crois que c'est bien la différence fondamentale entre les pro et ceux qui se demandent le pourquoi de ce genre de requêtes. L'un des deux feint de ne pas voir. Les cas sont nombreux pour les infertilités, elles peuvent être résolues par un simple traitement hormonal, ou par une fecondation in vitro ou par un don de sperme ou par un don d'ovocyte mais elles proviennent de problèmes biologiques insolubles . Dans les cas du couple lesbien, l'infertilité provient du type de sexualité et non d'un donné biologique, et la demande provient d'un besoin de sécurisation juridique sur la question de la filiation : Elle doit être anonyme pour ""éviter"" les questions. 

&gt;Les deux ne peuvent pas faire de bébé ensemble. 

Réducteur au bas mot. La question est survolée intentionnellement. 

&gt;Les deux souhaitent avoir une PMA pour répondre à ce problème.

Cf ce que j'ai dit précédemment, il y a un besoin juridique et non médical. 

&gt;La différence, c'est que le couple lesbien ne lui donnera pas de ""modèle masculin"" dans son éducation.

La différence, c'est que pour le couple infertile c'est un pis-aller, pour remédier à une souffrance. Pour le couple lesbien, c'est une revendication identitaire. 

&gt;Ouais eh bien cesse de caricaturer ton propos en insultant les lesbiennes. J'aime bien discuter avec toi, j'essaie de comprendre ton point de vue pour affiner le mien, mais tes diatribes sur les lesbiennes incapables de penser à autre chose que la détestation de l'homme, ça rend pas le tout plus intelligible. 

Malheureusement tu me prêtes une parenté qui ne m'appartient pas. Je n'ai ni inventé les Amazones, ni les Femens. 

&gt;La question est sexuelle, et même si t'as pas mis de mots clairs dessus, tu l'as aussi abordé quand tu disais "" elles veulent imposer leur névrose et leur ostracisation de la gente masculine à des bébés. Sinon je ne vois pas ce qui les empêcheraient de se faire engrosser par leur entourage.""

C'est faux, la question est idéologique. Sinon l'argument sexuel ne tient pas. Tu préfères une procédure médicale où tu ne connaîtras pas l'identité du père ( ce pourrait même être un affreux homophobe ) , où tu vas devoir passer des examens long, coûteux, invasifs et incertains puis se faire inséminer comme une vache plutôt qu'un rapport sexuel qui peut-être plié en 30 secondes et qui coûterait peanuts ? Niveau espérance, ça place le fait de ne pas toucher un homme assez haut dans l'échelle de valeur ou alors est-ce le fait de garantir un enfant sans père dès l'insémination qui serait très haut ? 

&gt;tu soulignes bien le côté sexuel de la question. Ces filles-là ne veulent pas se faire engrosser à l'ancienne parce que ça n'est pas leur sexualité. 

Tu n'as pas compris et c'est la raison de la digression du dessus. J'ai utilisé le terme engrosser uniquement pour souligner le caractère relativement simple voire expéditif de la solution à un problème qui devient un sujet de société MAJEUR alors que ce n'est même pas un problème ni sexuel ni biologique ni pratique juste idéologique. Peu différent au fond de musulmans qui ne peuvent pas vivre en bons musulmans s'ils n'appliquent pas la charia. Donc l'Etat doit plier.  

&gt;C'est exactement la même chose que si tu disais à une fille dont le copain est stérile ""va te faire engrosser par ton voisin et fais pas chier avec ces questions de PMA, c'est pas naturel ces choses-là"". 

Sauf que les questions de PMA n'ont pas uniquement trait à l'infertilité du mec. Il peut y avoir don d'ovocyte, don de sperme, traitement hormonal, aide à la fécondation dans le cas d'une motilité faible etc. Dans le cas du couple lesbien fertile, c'est un problème de manque de matériel génétique pas de déficience du matériel génétique.

They need to toss about all of it except soldier and personnel wages imho :/ Boats and planes are useless if your population is starving. Unless you are north korea, but i'm not quite sure they are an example to follow. They can, on the other hand, count on the full help of the rest of Europe if they really were in danger, it goes without saying imho. So they'd need to send about the whole defense budget to the social budget.

&gt; But we have to do it in such a way as to prevent undercutting what is effectively a very battered economy (it's GDP has declined by 15 percent since 2009). Giving out free meals in schools and stocking soup kitchens rather than letting the food just accumulate in warehouses would be the best solution.

Yep; that's the idea i try to express :) Send food on the verge of being perished. Take every supermarket stock with only a week before going bad and freight it by train in the same day straight to greece. The intra europe rail network is in very good shape and would be near perfect for it imho; they could distribute it immediatly in the streets and greeks right now would probably rush to take everything, it wouldn't rot in a corner.

&gt;First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalization of Relations

&gt;1.	There will be an Association/Community of Serb majority municipalities in Kosovo. Membership will be open to any other municipality provided the members are in agreement. 

&gt;2.	The Community/Association will be created by statute. Its dissolution shall only take place by a decision of the participating municipalities. Legal guarantees will be provided by applicable law and constitutional law (including the 2/3 majority rule).

&gt;3.	The structures of the Association/Community will be established on the same basis as the existing statute of the Association of Kosovo municipalities e.g. President, vice President, Assembly, Council.

&gt;4.	In accordance with the competences given by the European Charter of Local Self Government and Kosovo law the participating municipalities shall be entitled to cooperate in exercising their powers through the Community/Association collectively. The Association/Community will have full overview of the areas of economic development, education, health, urban and rural planning.

&gt;5.	The Association/Community will exercise other additional competences as may be delegated by the central authorities.

&gt;6.	The Community/Association shall have a representative role to the central authorities and will have a seat in the communities' consultative council for this purpose. In the pursuit of this role a monitoring function is envisaged.

&gt;7.	There shall be one police force in Kosovo called the Kosovo Police. All police in northern Kosovo shall be integrated in the Kosovo Police framework. Salaries will be only from the KP.

&gt;8.	Members of other Serbian security structures will be offered a place in equivalent Kosovo structures.

&gt;9.	There shall be a Police Regional Commander for the four northern Serb majority municipalities (Northern Mitrovica, Zvecan, Zubin Potok and Leposavic). The Commander of this region shall be a Kosovo Serb nominated by the Ministry of Interior from a list provided by the four mayors on behalf of the Community/Association. The composition of the KP in the north will reflect the ethnic composition of the population of the four municipalities. (There will be another Regional Commander for the municipalities of Mitrovica South, Skenderaj and Vushtrri). The regional commander of the four northern municipalities will cooperate with other regional commanders.

&gt;10. The judicial authorities will be integrated and operate within the Kosovo legal framework. The Appellate Court in Pristina will establish a panel composed of a majority of K/S judges to deal with all Kosovo Serb majority municipalities.

&gt;11. A division of this Appellate Court, composed both by administrative staff and judges will sit permanently in northern Mitrovica (Mitrovica District Court). Each panel of the above division will be composed by a majority of K/S judges.  Appropriate judges will sit dependant on the nature of the case involved.

&gt;12.	Municipal elections shall be organized in the northern municipalities in 2013 with the facilitation of the OSCE in accordance with Kosovo law and international standards.

&gt;13.	Discussions on Energy and Telecoms will be intensified by the two sides and completed by June 15.

&gt;14.	It is agreed that neither side will block, or encourage others to block, the other side's progress in their respective EU path.

&gt;15.	An implementation committee will be established by the two sides, with the facilitation of the EU.

You'll notice that it doesn't even *mention* independence.

true,Britzer,GERM,Germany,"Actually Dresden was just one city. For some reason in the craziness of war they decided to find a way to inflict the most civillian casulties possible and called it ""moral bombing"". It was supposed to break the spirit of the Germans back then. To that end they used scientists to determine the perfect way to start a ""firestorm"". A fire so strong that it sucks the oxygen out of the sourroundings and suffocates anyone close to the city the firestorm is raging in. It involves bombs to break up the water pipes, so there is no water pressure for the firefighters, bombs that have a big blast to open up the roofs and then lots of small firebombs that fall into the buidings. They chose cities based on how good they would burn. So they bombed the historic inner cities. 

Everything old in Germany was obliterated from the air in WWII. About 600.000 German civillians are said to have died. In Dresden, of course, but also in Hamburg, Koblenz, Magdeburg and, just before the war was over, and for absolutely no other reason than to kill civillians and to destroy their homes (no wartime industry there), Pforzheim. To drive home the fact that they wanted to kill people.

If you're American, let me ask you something: are you willing to spend between 600 and a 1,000 dollars for a flight to Paris plus another 600 to 1,000 for a flight home?  Food might cost between 200 and 300 depending on your lifestyle.  I have no idea what kind of insurance you would be on... I guess just travel insurance that your parents could arrange?  That might cost like 150.  Then you have rent which could be between 500 and 800 depending on your lifestyle plus utilities which could be 200 or so.

I'm asking that because my cousin had the same attitude before he came living with us in Paris for a few months with the same goal as you have. He had done a few semesters of French at his university and getting good grades so he figured that he would be fine. 

He was crushed when he realized that his proficiency level was way below what he needed to actually use his French in his daily live and thus make any progress in that regard.

Do note that it doesn't mean that you cannot get around in Paris without speaking French. It would be perfectly fine for a couple of months.

Just make sure that your level will be enough to actually be able to use it.

true,uututhrwa,null,null,"I agree with your argument that Greece has a ""mentality"" problem, in fact many Greeks believe that too, but won't directly admit it coming from a foreigner.

The main problem is not exactly the tax evasion but a culture of ""guilds"", favoring your ""people"", having ""connections"", and misinterpreting the ""organization of a socialist like state"" to ""upwards income equality is only a matter of politics, if you don't get what you ask point your finger to someone that makes decisions and he is at fault, if it doesn't make too much sense just abuse macroeconomic theories and invent conspiracies"". And populism. And nobody accepts faults, if he did then he won't be able to be part of a ""guild"" if you know what I mean.

The mentality according to some people started from the Ottoman empire, but whatever, it really got noticeable with the millitary Junta and then the first years of PASOK (circa 1981-1989). In fact if you knew greek and could read greek newspapers and forums you'd often see this claim, that somehow it was specifically during those years that the society started to change.

Also have you heard of those stories about greek cops beating up a tourist cause he asked for their cop ids, or prisoning a guy because he danced in front of the Acropolis or sth, that's an expression of another attitude problem, everyone acts like he is authority, he's on a ""power trip"".

It would be too lengthy to describe this shit convincingly enough, but in the end it's to justify the fact that his job is something redundant or if he is actually corrupt. I mean it's not just the cops, the stereotypical authoritative jackass that is actually a state parasite and will sing a different tune once you bribe, happens in various other agencies.

And for all of the above it's not uncommon for the skilled or the ""entrepreneurial"" to do business abroad, and only come here for the summer, or in the case of the ultra rich, to on;y deal with greece in setting up semi-state monopolies and other corrupt and easily profitable businesses. For other ""productive"" ventures they'll just go abroad, to avoid dealing with people that will ""claim to be whatever they want"" as the saying goes in greece.

There is also an inability to optimize or even accept the existance of trade offs, like 80% disagree with the measures and 80% also disagree with leaving the eurozone. It doesn't make sense, it's like, they think they should be on a constant bargaining and only apply the measures in some convoluted process that will save those ""in the know"" and affect ""suckers"", clearly facing the trade off is something that just won't happen. 

Or like I said above about not accepting faults, the same people that benefited the most from the previous governments, now call their politicians ""traitors"", and if you were to say what you did above, ""but they voted them"" they'll just answer ""we were deceived""

But wait, there is more ...

He can then enjoy a visit to *The Sleeping Beauty Castle*® of the  Disneyland Park®, similar to the one in the Disneyland® of California®. It's much better than those boring and time consuming real old historical castles. And it even features ... ""*a dungeon type area in the base featuring an Audio-Animatronic dragon, and above, a concrete balcony walkthrough area with Sleeping Beauty stained glass windows and tapestries. There are also several shops selling glass figures, ornaments and gifts*"". 

He can thus combine history and rides, oh boy! Pus he'll have most of the weekend left ... to visit the rest of Europe! Isn't that just WONDERFUL?

- Hitchhiking is fairly easy along the coast. There's much less of a wait if you're more or less in straight line between Barcelona and North Portugal. That doesn't mean it's extremely easy, you'll still have to wait a bit, maybe even hours to get a ride. Countryside, it's even more difficult because of the decreased amount of traffic.

Don't pay attention to Turkish rhetoric, it's mostly bullshit. As Mark Twain would say, they ""lie like Turks"". Europe being hard on Turkey has nothing to do with it. What's happening is that, Turkey's leadership sees the financial troubles plaguing Europe. They thus consider Europe to be weak. So, they suck up to those whom they consider powerful. It used to be the US and Europe. It's still the US but now it's Russia and China instead of Europe.

Traditionally Turkey always sided with whomever it considered strongest at the time. In WWII, for example, at first the Turks sided with the Germans  ... until Germany started loosing ... at which point they turned around and sided with the allies.  Turkey signed a peace treaty with Nazi Germany on June 18, 1941, just four days before the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union.

Auch wenn hier jede Menge Indizien auf die Unschuld des H. Arnold hinweisen, ist es immernoch keine 100% klare Beweislage die das eine oder andere bestätigt. 

Mal angenommen diese ""Heidi"" wurde wirklich vergewaltigt. Sie scheint eine ziemliche labile Persönlichkeit zu haben und eventuell (!) dadurch all diese Ungereimtheiten erzeugt haben. Natürlich ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit dafür fast null, aber halt nur fast.

Ich kann zwar gerade keine Quellen vorweise, aber es gibt wohl bestimmt auch doppelte Justizirrtümer in dieser Art in der Vergewaltigter erst zu recht verurteilt wurden und dann zu unrecht wieder in Revision freigesprochen wurde. (Vielleicht auch nicht, aber ich halte es dennoch für möglich, dass solche Fälle existieren könnten)

Daher finde ich es auch ziemlich unmoralisch, dass Medien bei vielen Vergewaltigungsfällen noch vor Prozessende für eine Seite Partei ergreifen, ohne stichhaltige Beweise (Glasklare Indizien sind keine Beweise). Wie im Fall Kachelmann und jetzt auch in diesem. Wobei mich interessieren würde, wie die Medien über diesen Fall berichtet haben als der Schuldspruch für H.Arnold fiel.

true,Maximovitch,null,null,"Mammouthor, on ne nie pas ces agressions, tout comme on ne cherche pas à excuser les agresseurs car ils seraient ""opprimés"" (tu es bien le seul à utiliser ce verbe, relis donc). Je dis juste qu'ils ont le SENTIMENT d'être exclus, marginalisés, précarisés etc. Tout comme ce sentiment existe aussi chez des blancs et n'est pas l'apanage des rebeus de cités. 

Maintenant, parler de racisme anti-blanc comme d'un phénomène de société à part entière, à égale position avec le racisme xénophobe, là non, c'est de la manipulation. Je te renvois par exemple à la discrimination à l'embauche, ou tout simplement à l'histoire française où, je crois, il a toujours fait bon vivre parmi les français ""de souche"". D'ailleurs, tu ne t'es jamais interrogé pourquoi on parlait soudainement partout d'un racisme spécifiquement anti-blanc ? Est-ce un phénomène nouveau depuis deux-trois ans ? A-t-il toujours existé mais était-il caché ? Ou pire, est-ce qu'on nous le cachait ou nous refusions de le voir ? Je crois bien que du ressentiment ou de la haine envers des blancs, il y en a toujours eu. Mais dans notre société, cela n'a jamais été un phénomène social. Par contre, depuis une dizaine d'années, des groupuscules d'extrême-droite en font leur crédo. Ils l'incluent systématiquement dans leurs coms, en font un élément de langage récurrent, et l'imposent petit à petit dans l'espace public. Je me souviens d'une phrase de Fabrice Robert, président du Bloc Identitaire, qui se félicitait d'avoir imposé ce thème en moins de dix ans...

J'ai moi-même déjà été insulté de ""sale français"" ou ""sale blanc"". Quelques discussions plus tard, j'étais pote avec mon ""agresseur"". Ce racisme ""anti-blanc"" est surtout une réaction à un modèle sociétal qui fait du français blanc moyen l'idéal. Il s'agit plus d'un ressentiment, d'une jalousie, qu'autre chose. Que je sache, il n'existe pas de stéréotype, de caricature de l'homme blanc où ces traits physiques ou psychologiques seraient exagérés et insultés. Au contraire, on sait combien les noirs et les arabes se sont vus imposer (malheureusement parfois encore) de telles étiquettes. Si les noirs sont des ""faignants"" ou les arabes des ""voleurs"" (ou autres joyeusetés), le français blanc ne souffre nul part d'une étiquette péjorative. Edward Said, dans son bouquin L'Orientalisme (1978), a très bien analysé l'image que l'Occident a projeté de l'Oriental depuis le XIXème siècle (encore d'actualité aujourd'hui). Il n'existe pas de telles caricatures ou préjugés racistes à l'égard de l'homme blanc en France. C'est pourquoi j'affirme que ce racisme anti-blanc n'est pas un phénomène social. Par contre, si tout le monde s'acharne à le dire, à le définir, à le considérer comme vrai, alors cela risque d'en inspirer certains qui vont exploiter cette peur d'un racisme antiblanc pour radicaliser leur colère contre la société française. Et l'extrème-droite pourra bien clamer que sa prophétie s'est réalisée, à partir du moment ou elle a tout fait pour attiser les clivages.",0,1367060318,null,0,1367060865,0,c9no6jp,t3_1d5cgn,t1_c9no6jp,t1_c9n71vi,null,1431410907,0,false,france,t5_2qhjz,0

When I got my driver's licence, my doctor told me there's the possibility to get declared 'funktionell einäugig' (functionally one-eyed, sorry if that doesn't make sense in English). That means, that if the abilities of both eyes summed up are above 140% and one eye is over 100%, you don't need any kind of glasses whatsoever (at least for driving). Although this was for my car-licence, I have no idea if motorcycle is any different from that.

Depends what those taxes are used for. If they're invested in education, infrastructure, and a strong social security net that allows citizens to take risks without fearing for their children's future, I'd say ""yes"".

&gt; more expensive energy

If that energy is unsustainable, then yes. Incentives should be put in place to encourage investment in sustainable energy sources — in Spain's case, that'd probably be solar power first, hydroelectric power second, which would eventually lead to very cheap energy.

&gt; lower wages

If the alternative to ""lower wages"" is ""no wages"", which is what the ~30% unemployed are experiencing, then that's the way it has to go. If there's another alternative, I'd go for that.

&gt; no formal courses for unemployed

Higher taxes may sponsor those.

&gt; more expensive college, more expensive vocational education and worse mandatory education

Again, higher taxes sponsor college education in other countries, and should in Spain as well.

Sagrada Familia (book online to skip the wait), Montjuic (Olimpic Parc, Museum of Art if you are into Romanic, the Castle for a good view of the City), Ciutat Vella (having a walk, Picasso Museum, Catedral del Mar), Las Ramblas (Mercado de la Boquería, plaza de la reina), Paseo de Gracia (Casa Milá), Plaza de España (go to the top of Las Arenas mall), and beaches (best for me is Castelldefels outside of town but you have Barceloneta inside).
Some restaurants I like: Taller de Tapas, Shunka (best Sushi in town IMHO), Salamanca (for a Paella).

* Madrid:
Retiro (to chill out, best on sunday), Plaza Mayor, Puerta del Sol, Gran Via, Prado Museum (check Goya and Velazquez Collections), Reina Sofia Museum (for Picasso's Guernika and leave), Berbaneu Tour (if you are into football). Take a 1 day trip to Toledo (a must). Tourist really like the 100 montaditos franchise to eat some tapas.

You didn't need hindsight. None of the Allies needed hindsight.

And this is simply incorrect. There wasn't a single motive and motives were mixed. Self-interest played a part. But claiming that a principled desire to stop genocidal fascism wasn't a main motivation is just ahistorical, self-serving nonsense.

&gt;*seeing WW2 as Nazi Germany with their Jewish concentration camps vs America with their Japanese concentration camps, Russia with their gulags, and the British who invented concentration camps and personally terrorised Ireland for centuries was a valid assessment.*

No it wasn't. Germany's treatment of the Jews was well-understood even if the Final Solution hadn't yet been arrived at. Claiming that the good folk of Ireland *and their leaders*  knew enough about the conditions in German concentration camps, but not death camps, to assess them as being on a par with the Boer War camps is, again, ahistorical self-serving nonsense. 

&gt;*you'll know it was also evil.*

So sending condolences about Hitler's death is excused?

&gt;*I can't imagine there are many Irishmen who lived at the time who looked at Britain fighting Germany and saw any difference between them*

if that's true then that says a lot about Irish stupidity or willful blindness. but we're not really debating your paucity of imagination here are we.

Turkey lies at the gateway to europe, it should be Europes aim, its absolute priority to make sure that the gateway to this continent is in our sphere of influence and not in others. America has been vital in achieving this for us but now its influence and interest is diminishing.

The fact that its muslim, its human rights records are not good etc etc does not matter as strongly as some of you believe. You do not deal with the world based upon an idealised version of what you want it to be. You deal with it based upon current realities. The current reality is that Turkey is not a bastion of civil liberties nor tolerance (relative to Europe) but they are important to us and they are slowly turning their back to Europe and facing east. 

A Turkey that is pivoting to Asia is not good for Europe at all. In a couple of generations our absolute power may not have diminished, but our relative power will have. Economically and militarily. We should make it our priority now, when we are in a incredibly strong position to bring Turkey closer. A Turkey that is politically, economically and militarily interdependent with Europe is better for Europe. We tried to do this with EU ascension but this is something a lot of people do not want for a variety of reasons. In any case it doesn't matter if its through EU ascension or through some other means, it needs to be achieved. Otherwise we will have the eurasian landmass controlled by the soon to be largest economy in the world with a large and quickly modernising military.

 A Turkey invested in China may also pave the way for more Chinese influence in the Middle east and by extension North Africa.  If this trend continues we may see in 20 - 30 years ( or even in a closer timespan), Chinese naval bases in Turkey (and with that Chinese Naval ships patrolling the mediterranean regularly). 

If you can even at the furthest recesses of your mind contemplate a world in which the West is no longer the world's dominant power, one in which it is kept in check by other equally powerful powers (be they China, India etc) then this can only be seen as a significant step forward for Chinese influence and a step backwards for European influence. It is the small stuff that matters in the big picture. 

China is not an enemy, but it is definitely an adversary and one that Europe is competing with for influence. And it seems to be that we are losing.

What about other deterrents? The bear deterrents seem to work. Is there nothing for wolves? Again, note that ""wolves are among the least threatening for their size and predatory potential"" means there probably isn't much desire to find a deterrent.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"This is unpopular because it's sort of an argument which condones the mass killing and sometimes extinction of certain species of animals, but I think it's worth saying here. 

It's worth noting that animals like wolves, tigers and lions have seen rabid decline in populations of the passed years, decades and centuries. Yes it's almost certainly because of humans that these animals are being pushed to extinction. However, it's worth noting that these animals are often even more violently and even more of a strain on their habitat than humans are. [This map](http://i.imgur.com/i9acGyw.png) from /r/MapPorn made a lot of people very sad, but then a lot of others started coming ""yeah, well, then I remembered that those lions go around killing all sorts of other people and animals"". There is a reason these animals are extinct. That reason is because their habitat can no longer support them. Do we really want these creatures who do little for their environment apart from mooch off of other creatures? Furthermore, do *you* really want lions, tigers and wolves in your back garden? Ok, they're unlikely to attack people, but it's not unprecedented. 

Basically the argument boils down to that if you try and support creatures like lions and wolves, they'll be causing huge damage to their environment just like humans are. At least humans can impose limits on themselves like the Green Belt in England or by having protected/endangered species. Big cats and wolves don't have that. They just kill and furthermore they might kill you. If you think about the lions map, what do you think the farmer who lives in East Africa thinks about their being less lions to mooch off of his cattle? The cattle which supports the landscape, and supports him. Not only would those lions have taken away his lively hood by killing his farm animals, but they could also have killed him or a family member. That East African farmer does not have to live with any of those difficulties now (though that does not mean his life is easy).

The argument can be further developed by saying that humans are already in a dominant role on planet Earth. We have to take control of things, just like we control ourselves. We can't just leave nature to do its thing. We've altered the world far too much to let it just be. 

Anyway: I thought that argument should be put forward.",0,1367074593,null,0,false,0,c9nqh1q,t3_1d7jqk,t1_c9nqh1q,t1_c9no8bk,null,1431409828,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

true,AlwaysAppropriate,SWED,Sweden,"I'm all for wolves being left alone as they are (being a hunter in sweden). If left alone entirely as is, regions will become unsafe for free-roaming cattle and other domestic animals. It's not ""just"" elk and deer being chowed down by wolves, it's more about what's going to happen when the wolf-population grows beyond the means of the nature to provide. 

Drawing a simplified parallell with rodents and foxes they have a natural ""swing around"" time of about 10 years where there's either an over-abundance of each species because either the foxes have eaten all the rodents and barely any left which then turns around and we start seeing starving foxes and the pendelum is going around again.

Now imagine that instead with wolves and elks/deer... unfortunately, wolves are a fair bit bigger than foxes and quite adaptable... meaning when the ""natural"" resources are done and easy prey are hurdled into pens they have little reason to search for food elsewhere. What happens ofcourse is that the ""swing around"" time is going to become larger. 

Counter-measures are of course being tested to try and isolate the wolves to their natural habitat and prey, such as llamas guarding sheep, special fences, etc.

It's just a question of tolerance... the farmers/saami that are testing these things are so far getting compensation for the loss of their animals from the government. Sooner or later, the farmers are not gonna wait for hunters and local governance to agree on counter-measures that are humane and poaching will commence... 

We used to have a ""licensed"" wolf-hunt here but this year they stopped it based on cries from various wildlife organizations.

true,Elukka,null,null,"&gt;Also, I was under the impression that wolves would attack humans when they were starved. 

Supposedly so but wolves learn not to fear man and they can be highly opportunistic carnivores. They don't have to be starving to attack new prey just out of curiosity if the opportunity arises. 

&gt;Maybe your countryside is just as placid as ours and you haven't realized it.

I live on the edge of that dark green blotch in Southern Finland and just 10 miles from me are deep forests where wolves hunt, live and breed regularly. We have to keep (legally) shooting ""aberrant individuals"" who boldly come eat dogs, sheep etc. straight out of people's yards. It is a very regular thing that wolves practically walk through home yards and farmhouse yards during the nights and this has been confirmed by using game cameras.

There are a lot of small farms and individual homes in the middle of relatively deep forests and many of them are in weekly contact with the wolves. People living out there don't let their children walk to school anymore and going out alone into the forest in the dark of the night would be an unnecessary risk.

&gt;Interesting point. But you're making whatever I say going to sound uninformed or petty, due to the fact that you pointed out that I'm British.

Doesn't make it any less true or diminish the fact that people living in the safety of Central European urban environments usually have absolutely no idea about the wildernesses of Eastern Europe. A wolf sanctuary is not the same thing as a pack of 10-20 wolves freely prowling a hundred square miles. It might be a condescending generalization but it's the first thing that pops into our heads. ""You have no idea about the realities of the wilderness.""

&gt;But put things into perspective, they happened a long time ago and we've advanced more since then.

Advanced, how? The wolves will clash with humans again the moment their numbers pick up dramatically. There is no advancement needed for the wolves as they're masterful predators and supremely intelligent. You can try your howl tapes and whatever but the wolves will learn and they will take their easy food from the farms and front yards if it's there for them.",0,1367076352,null,0,false,0,c9nqwl8,t3_1d7jqk,t1_c9nqwl8,t1_c9nqbki,null,1431409624,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The point remains, regardless of your silly attempts at insults.

That makes your really rather dim.

Your quote is inaccurate. Google returns [no relevant results](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lie+like+Turks%22). It was a nice attempt to push your turkophobic stereotypes though. 

&gt; Europe being hard on Turkey has nothing to do with it. What's happening is that, Turkey's leadership sees the financial troubles plaguing Europe. They thus consider Europe to be weak.

The two are not unrelated. Given the diminishing benefits of membership, the cost of joining Europe may not be worth the price. So it may well be that the terms the EU is asking for are too hard in exchange for what it is offering in return. And by this I do not mean the conditions for better human rights, which I think Turkey should respect, but the concrete political concessions that they are asked to make. 

&gt;  So, they suck up to those whom they consider powerful. 

Welcome to International Relations 101. Countries do what is in their national interest. 

&gt;  Turks only understand ""power"". 

How is this not true for every single country in the world? Can you cite any country that does not understand power?

&gt; ""Turks do not aspire, they do not hope, they ... fear""

Another one of your stupid stereotypical quotes no doubt. 

Turkey is the only country in the Middle East that successfully fought the wester war of colonization and successfully won [its independence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_War_of_Independence), and avoided becoming the mess that the Arabs have been turned into. It seems like some people in Europe still suffer from this colonial complex of seeing themselves as superior where they ""aspire"" and ""hope"" for higher goals, while their colonial subjects are two dimensional animal like characters that can only be pushed around by ""fear"" of punishment. 

Well, I can assure you that is not the case. Turkey has great aspirations, and through this move it is telling Europe it won't wait forever to realize them. ",0,1367081363,null,0,1367081786,0,c9nsacz,t3_1d76sc,t1_c9nsacz,t1_c9nnr6u,null,1431408900,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Just like most subreddits, the facebook group has rules, and moderation. If you are posting things outside the rules, they will be removed. Generally I just hide the posts, but if people are constantly commenting on them I give up and remove them as the move the valid posts out of the top spot. 

I use the events tab for larger events. Nobody else does though. 

Everybody edits everybody else's wiki recommendations. That's what makes wikis good places to find information.  It's not *yours* or *mine* but rather the whole community's. If you disagree with something, or notice an issue, please fix it, that's the point of using the wiki, instead of linking to one long post. 

As much as you may think I was criticizing you, I have no idea who edits what parts of the wiki. I went to see if the page you were sending people to was neat looking to make it easier for them to keep consistent formatting, and then I tried to remind them to keep it neat for easy reading.

Unterschiede gibt es nur darum, weil national Parteien auch Einfluss auf ihre jeweiligen europäischen Gegenstücke im Europaparlament haben.

You fail to realise as well that at that time the IRA had already become a terrorist organisation and had nothing to do with the will of the vast majority of people, The Irish government swiftly arrested most IRA members when they contacted Germany and arrested the Nazi's that visited Ireland.
Also if you were aware of the atrocities of the British in Ireland you should understand the very anti-British feeling of the time. You swear Ireland knew that Hitler was killing millions of Jews when even Britain didn't until well into the war when it was basically over and all Hitler could do was take as many people with him as possible.
&gt;While the Allies gave lives every step of the way to Hiler's bunker the irish Prime Minister gave condolences to the Nazi Empire for Hitler's death.

Develera also gave his condolences to America when Roosevelt died, it was called being neutral. He did not give favor to any side out of fear of an invasion from either the Nazi's or the allies.
Ireland didn't have any resources to fight a war or the men. At the time  we were still recovering from the famine, population wise we still haven't  we only had around 3 million people at the time and most of them were farmers struggling to make an income. We were a backward agricultural based country we didn't even have enough guns to give our 10,000 soldier's or any way of transporting them to Europe.

You are in no position to judge Irish neutrality when you have no clue about our history. You can judge our neutrality when you have the facts but you don't.

I'm shamelessly hijacking the top comment in an effort to get rid of the plague of sensationalism.

1) Many people were laid off during the past 100 years, for many different reasons. What changed now is that the process is sped up, mainly because courts are overloaded. That is a double-edged sword, because some of the accused might be innocent. MPs will vote about it tomorrow. That is in the future. Journalists take note.

2) Regarding the 180,000 employees mentioned: this is not the number of people that will be laid off. This number includes people that are nearing pension age, non-permanent employees of the wider public sector that won't see their contracts renewed (although others will take their place when needed), etc.

3) Blaming the public sector for anything and everything is a popular sport. This time, it's about its size again.

De facto population of Greece (2011 census): [10,939,727](http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/ESYE/BUCKET/General/defacto_population_census2011.xls) (xls)

Number of public sector employees (October 2012): [667,733, of which 571,123 are permanently employed](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=el&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imerisia.gr%2Farticle.asp%3Fcatid%3D26509%26subid%3D2%26pubid%3D113000229&amp;act=url) (Google translation)

(Devil's advocate: how do we know that these numbers are valid? There was a public sector employees census. Anyone not filling in his/her data stopped getting paid. Simple and effective.)

In other words, 1 in 20 is permanently employed in the public sector.

Time for a comparison now. Some figures from OECD, up until 2008 (start of the global economic crisis):

http://www.oecd.org/gov/pem/publicemploymentkeyfigures.htm

Even then, Greece was *way* below the OECD average.

As it's popular to compare everything with EU's evil Nazi overlords (should I really put a note here about not being literal?), Germany had 4.6m civil servants in 2011, with a population of 82m. We see that Greece is in the same league as far as numbers go.

Concluding, the Greek public sector needs modernization, not scapegoating. Letting go of the ""old guard"" and hiring young people will help with this. Indiscriminatively firing public sector employees because someone, somewhere needs to adjust some figures wouldn't help at all. It would lead to the collapse of essential services and to the increase of social tensions.

If this would happen it wouldn't be a one way street right? It would mean that Europeans can go to North America as well. Europe's native population is on a massive decline and demographic crisis.

On the other side we sure as Hell don't need a foreigners who have a very different life style than ours(I mean that **is** why their ancestors went to America in the first place, right?). We don't need our criminals(or their descendants) back. Nor do we need a bunch of former slaves.

Also look at our situation-you get all the immigrants from Romania, Bulgaria, Poland which is bad for both the country that receives immigrants and the one who gives them out. Because these countries lose citizens and we have to get people with totally different ideas and life style. It would be the same just bigger and worse. Maybe first we should fix our problems in the EU and then think about Americans. When we sent them there(or they went) I don't think anyone wanted them here. Why would that be different?

The fact that your friend is out of job or something doesn't mean he can just come here. Am I right that he is probably of Italian descent immigrant to America? With all the economical problems that Italy has right now plus the high unemployment the last thing we need is someone just coming back and taking the job of some local dude or even worse-feeding off our welfare system.

true,Scanicula,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;I live on the edge of that dark green blotch in Southern Finland and just 10 miles from me are deep forests where wolves hunt, live and breed regularly. We have to keep (legally) shooting ""aberrant individuals"" who boldly come eat dogs, sheep etc. straight out of people's yards. It is a very regular thing that wolves practically walk through home yards and farmhouse yards during the nights and this has been confirmed by using game cameras.

As long as you keep killing -or at least scaring away- wolves that come near human settlements, and thus are posing a threat, I guess that would keep the wolves at bay. Combined with a relatively high availability of prey, wolves should have no reason to kill, or even attack humans. There's a difference between killing a few individuals posing a threat to livestock, kids, dogs and such, and killing off an entire population, or even species, because they *may* pose a threat occasionally. I'm totally okay with the former, whereas I think the latter is unacceptable.

I think maybe wolves, and threats from any other animal, are one of the things people living in, or near, nature will have to accept as a part of their life.

You didn't criticise his opinion you outright said he ""should be disqualified from the human race."" which is rather offensive.
And this will be the last time I explain this and to make it clear i'm going to explain this to as if you were a child. 

The English were very mean to the Irish, taking their land, killing their people, running their country for Britains own gain, shipping our relatives to America and Australia. One day the Irish said no more and fought the British, the Germans were very nice and sympathetic to the Irish giving them weapons to fight the evil foregin rulers. Then when the evil empire is gotten rid of they ask the country they used to pick on for help and then Ireland said no... because the evil empire took all their resources desimated their lands and killed millions of their people. The Germans however did not ask Ireland to go to war and put no pressure on them whatsoever. Although the Germans were not that nice and Ireland didn't agree with them they decided not to go to war out of fear of being destroyed be either side as Ireland was well within reach of bombers and ships and was very badly defended. With no way of declaring war even if they wanted to they decided to stay neutral.

Now does that explain why we didn't go to war or will I take it down a bit again? At the time England seemed just as evil as Germany to the Irish.

Additionally, generally I would make an exception for human meat eaters based on grounds of being sentient, self aware, ect and that all other self aware or mentally capable species be given the same treatment. However that's a much bigger debate than I have time for.

No, that's really it's origin. [Here's the magazine that inspired Pierre Eugene du Simitiere](http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=4&amp;size=1&amp;id=gm.1747.x.x.17.x.x.u102).

This is what wiki has to say on it (it mentions the similar phrase used by Virgil):

&gt;The motto was suggested in 1776 by Pierre Eugene du Simitiere to the committee responsible for developing the seal. At the time of the American Revolution, the exact phrase appeared prominently on the title page of a popular periodical, The Gentleman's Magazine, which collected articles from many sources into one ""magazine"". This in turn can be traced back to the London-based Huguenot Peter Anthony Motteux, who used the adage for his The Gentleman's Journal, or the Monthly Miscellany (1692-1694). The phrase is similar to a Latin translation of a variation of Heraclitus's 10th fragment, ""The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the one."" A variant of the phrase was used in Moretum, a poem attributed to Virgil but with the actual author unknown. In the poem text, color est e pluribus unus describes the blending of colors into one. St Augustine used a variant of the phrase, ex pluribus unum, in his Confessions.

Back on topic:

&gt;It is not OK to used quotes that are removed from the context. In academia it would see your paper barred

Of course. But this is reddit, not academia. 

&gt;there are famous cases of films and plays being sued by reviewers after their quotes were denied context. 

For reasons such as defamation, denial of a good name etc., none of which is relevant to the OP.

&gt;I could take quote Plato out of context and make the 'ideal state' that posits his Republic to seem amiable and nice rather than the dystopian nightmare that represents the actuality of his vision.

You could. And doing so for that purpose would be intellectually dishonest. The OP used the quote for no such purpose.

&gt;Contextualised the quote is completely irrelevant and using that kind of quote out of context is lazy and generally bad practice. 

Again, it would be in academia. I don't think the OP is requesting a formal qualification from us. Nor is s/he trying to persuade us of a meticulously reasoned out point about the opinions of Kant. So, for current purposes, it grand.

&gt;It appears the quote is arguing for an EU style supra-natural body. 

In your opinion. That's certainly not what it reads like to me.

&gt;It would also appear that Kant had some kind of foresight about the present stability in the once conflict striken European continent.

This may be reddit and not academia but that doesn't reduce the fact that taking quotes out of context shouldn't really be done. There are of course humorous examples where it's appropriate to do so, nevertheless removing the context from a quote means that it means something different from what was originally intended. If you want to do that it's better not to mention that the quote was from Kant (although I can see why OP did). I'm an Anglican and one the academic battles that, as I am sure you are aware of, has been raging in Christianity, as to what extent the bible should be read literally. I understand it is probably because of that that I am particularly sensitive to people drawing quotes out of cultural/historical/literature context. It is impossible to read or write something without interpreting it through your own personal (to borrow a horrible phrase from philosophy) meta-ethic, but that doesn't change the fact that it dramatically alters the message. It also doesn't change the fact that when presented with a quote, an attempt should be made to work out why such an argument or view was put forward in order to establish some context. ""We may have the Nuclear Bomb but they have the Deutshmark"" could be interpreted any which way until it's made clear that it was a moan by French bank officials in 1992 as a result of the ERM. In this particular regard, the context is lacking and that either changes the quote's meaning or renders it irrelevant (as per OP's title) 

You say that you don't believe that the quote gestured towards either of the two things I mentioned, out of context I'd be interested hear what you thought the quote meant/represented.

Yeah, it's a nifty little factoid. Obviously it's current meaning in the US is the literal; originally the 13 States =&gt; 1, now sometimes seen as the various cultures becoming one (US as a melting pot).

I essentially agree with everything else you eloquently argued, except by degree. I'm not saying that this isn't a place for reasoned debate, just that reddit needn't be held to such high standards, especially in a case such as this. It does seem to me to be one of those cases where someone finds a quote and thinks ""hmm, that's interesting and thought provoking"", without necessarily even caring who said it. You mentioned a Hitler quote above. Now, if someone were to read a quote and think it relevant, intelligent, correct even, then they found out that Hitler had said it, their view of it would likely change. What I'm saying is that what is relevant here is that initial opinion of the quote (indeed void of context), that appreciation of an idea or words in isolation, before it is corrupted (as it were) by context. If I may ask; would you have recognised this quote as one of Kant's if it weren't marked as such?

If it was updated to a more modern speech I would have bet it was a quote from a European functionalist like David Mittrany. Which is why I made those two points which you responded to about its meaning. That's why I took a negative reaction and probably why I believe that it is all but impossible to decontexualise something like that. Especially a quote such that has political undertones and is open to interpretation from anyone, which is ambiguous enough to be used out of context and which can be slipped into a political narrative. Knowing it was Kant, there was a danger that Kant (a famous and respected philosopher in spite of his flaws) could be hijacked. 

With the Hitler quote, if you had seen it in the context of Mein Kampf I think it would definitely alter the meaning. At the very least it would have given it a subtext that couldn't be ignored. Take this ""It is enough that the people know there was an election. The people who cast the votes decide nothing. The people who count the votes decide everything."" It is pretty unpleasant but that Stalin said it gives the quote an extra edge beyond that of mere commentary.

**Un mondo normale**

“Bellissime opere”, “magnifica struttura”, “frequentatissimo locale”, “magnifico esempio”, “bellissima sequenza”, “gigantesca cattedrale”, “tavoli che traboccano” e “abbaglianti piastrelle”. Non è facile descrivere una città come Siviglia (Internazionale 992, pagina 78). Ma gli aggettivi e i toni superlativi aiutano solo se usati con moderazione. Altrimenti producono l’effetto opposto: una descrizione monotona e superficiale. Nell'epoca dei treni superveloci e delle macchine iperefficienti, degli straricchi, dei megasconti e dei governissimi, il mondo rischia di trasformarsi in un posto molto noioso. Meglio moderare i toni, e scegliere aggettivi semplici, ma precisi: il mondo tornerà a essere un posto vivace e colorato. Se ogni sconfitta è “epica”, ogni rivelazione “clamorosa” e ogni incidente “catastrofico”, se una grande quantità è sempre “impressionante” e un esperto di informatica è sempre un “genio”, il giorno che dovremo raccontare qualcosa di diverso e speciale ci troveremo a corto di parole. Oppure useremo le solite, e nessuno capirà. I giornalisti dovrebbero riservare i superlativi e le iperboli alle grandi occasioni. E sforzarsi di trovare delle alternative. Non sarebbe fantastico?

On a donc affaire à des échantillons spontanés. Quand le sondeur dispose d’un effectif suffisant (parfois plus de 1000, puisque le coût reste constant contrairement aux sondages par téléphone), il opère le redressement de l’échantillon par la méthode des quotas. Ce redressement s’effectue donc a posteriori contrairement à la méthode par quotas utilisée en France. Ce recours au volontariat a un défaut que connaissent bien les sondeurs : des personnes politisées, souvent à l’extrême droite, s’expriment plus volontiers. La rémunération est censée corriger ce biais politique. Ainsi, les internautes sont-ils invités à gagner des cadeaux ou des primes, dont la valeur totale est suffisamment attractive mais qui, divisée entre les gagnants, donne des gains faibles à chacun. Les sondeurs sont pris ici dans une situation de double contrainte : soit la rémunération est élevée et on les accuse de payer l’opinion ; soit elle est faible et ils ont du mal à trouver des sondés. Un sondage Harris Interactive, destiné à faire un scoop avec l’arrivée en tête de Marine Le Pen dans les intentions de vote (mars 2011), avait été si truqué, que la mise en cause des sondages par Internet et spécialement de la rémunération qu’il avait provoquée, avait amené les sondeurs à se défendre en invoquant la modicité de celle-ci. Mais si elle est faible, comment motiver les internautes ? La rémunération a un rendement décroissant : si les internautes étaient plus rémunérés, cela accroîtrait les coûts, mettrait en cause la légitimité d’une rétribution de l’opinion et enfin produirait des sondés professionnels.

""Market reaction

On the day that the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of information prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on fixed-income securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax.[1]

Even though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared.[1] 60% of the trading volume of the eleven most actively traded Swedish share classes moved to the UK after the announcement in 1986 that the tax rate would double. 30% of all Swedish equity trading moved offshore. By 1990, more than 50% of all Swedish trading had moved to London. Foreign investors reacted to the tax by moving their trading offshore while domestic investors reacted by reducing the number of their equity trades.[2]""

Well, that is why Finland have opted out, isn't it? You are afraid that your trade will move to Sweden? I think that is a smart move. 

However, it must be said that Eurozone's FTT will be much lower than the Swedish FTT, in the hope that it will not scare the investors away. I think it will though, I don't see why someone is going to continue to do a certain trade from Frankfurt, where it costs more, if you can do it from Amsterdam or London, cheaper. But I guess countries have a right to implement whatever taxes they want and the countries who will be harmed are the one implementing it. 

Edit: I just read a bit more on Wiki on the European FTT. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction_tax#European_Union_financial_transaction_tax). Apperently they calculate with a revenue of 57 billion Euros! I do not see how the trade can not move, it that is the case. Do they think the financial institutions will not notice a loss of 57 billions? If they have a choice to pay that or not to pay that - the choice is really, really easy. I can already feel the blame shifting as well. no every country who doesn't implement the FTT will be to blame for the failure of the tax for the Euro fanatics.
