No, that is not why there's such a unit of distance. It has more to do with the specific features of reindeer physiology. 

Reindeer's kidneys work quite differently from other ruminant mammals. Especially in the winter time their diet is mostly lichen and the kidneys work careful not to lose any precious nutrients with the urine making reindeer urine extra pure. But holding up urine too much or too long may mess with the system and cause proteins to enter into urinary tract, which may lead to a dangerous condition *kusiumpi* or blocked urinary tract. So reindeers need to go like a clock, and hence the *poronkusema*.

I don't know if the *amanita muscaria* story is actually true. But considering that reindeers do have a peculiar urinary system it might be. One way to confirm it would be to try it out, or perhaps check with other reindeer herding people's traditions (e.g. in Siberia) to see if also their shamans have used reindeer as a hallusinogen distillery.",0,1388337799,null,0,1388338598,0,cecmhrg,t3_1tvj82,t1_cecmhrg,t1_cecg4go,null,1427944135,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
true,balanceofpain,null,null,"&gt; Eine Verlängerung der Wahlperiode kann nur dann überhaupt in Betracht kommen, wenn gleichzeitig die demokratischen Rechte der Bürger auf andere Weise gestärkt werden - durch die Möglichkeit von Abstimmungen auf Bundesebene, durch Elemente der direkten Demokratie also, durch Volksbegehren und Volksentscheid.

Ich halte diese Argumentationsweise für sehr schwach, da nicht erkennbar wird, warum die Einführung des Plebiszits auf Bundesebene die Verlängerung der Wahlperiode um ein Jahr aufwiegt – Prantl behauptet schlicht, dass es so ist.  Eine Erörterung der Frage, wie lange eine Legislaturperiode währen soll, und warum nicht länger oder kürzer, wird nicht geboten.  Dabei ist überhaupt fraglich, dass die verstrichene Zeit hier den alleinigen Ausschlag geben sollte.  Andere positiv bestimmbare Faktoren wie die Zahl der geänderten Gesetze oder die Menge des im Bundesgesetzblatt veröffentlichen Textes könnten ebenso mit einfließen.

Überdies ist nicht unmittelbar ersichtlich, dass hier überhaupt Änderungen nötig sind.  Norbert Lammert begründete die Forderung nach einer Verlängerung der Wahlperiode damit, dass »das politische Interesse bei den Bürgern durch das häufige Abhalten von Wahlen überfordert werde«, und er sieht darin eine Begründung für die stetig sinkende Wahlbeteiligung.  Inwieweit diese Verlängerung eine Linderung darstellen kann, bleibt unklar.  Hat denn jemals eine solche Verlängerung zu einem Anstieg der Wahlbeteiligung geführt?  Oder könnte der Grund für die niedrige Wahlbeteiligung nicht auch darin liegen, dass sich für die meisten schlicht der Informationsaufwand nicht lohnt?  Daran dürfte sich nach der Verlängerung auch nichts ändern, denn die Dauer der Wahlkampfphase wird ja in etwa gleich bleiben, und auf die kommt es ja hauptsächlich an.  Wenn man wie Prantl eine vermeintliche informationelle Überforderung der Wähler als Argument für die Verlängerung der Wahlperiode implizit akzeptiert, ist es ziemlich inkonsistent, als Gegenleistung die Einführung eines Instrumentes zu fordern, das mit noch viel mehr Informationsaufwand verbunden ist.  Vielleicht muss man die sinkende Wahlbeteiligung einfach akzeptieren und schauen, wo sie sich letztendlich einpegeln wird.

A famous construction-sector millionaire, several ministers' sons and the husband of a celebrity were arrested. The [scheme](http://cdncms.zaman.com.tr/2013/12/20/harita2-b.jpg) involved banks, Iran, oil money and 87 billion euros, some found hidden in a shoebox. Police found money-counting machines in their houses, and such. The chief executive of a major bank was also arrested. Of course for the first few days the media tried to downplay it, then a few ministers resigned. One did it live on TV and asked Erdoğan also to resign, since he was the main man and everyone apparently had his consent. He also said that Erdoğan was pressuring his ministers. Then the interior minister resigned, after he sacked many police officers and solicitors. That night, Erdoğan renewed his whole cabinet (including Egemen Bağış..) A republic solicitor (not sure how to translate that) made a declaration where he said the evidence and the files had been taken from him. Also the police refused to obey court orders to arrest more people in a second wave.

Da qui il mio umile consiglio di investire poco, pochissimo, più per divertimento che come reale fonte di guadagno. A meno che ovviamente tu non sappia quello che fai.

I agree. I am not saying every doctor sucks. We are relatively happy with our current Paediatrician and our Otorhinolaryngology specialist (HNO).

I haven't yet in 8 years found a General Practitioner that I could find really competent. We have one for sure, but use it mostly as for some stuff you need to go through them.

But my feeling is still that you need to be lucky to find good ones. And not the other way around.

&gt;As for antibiotics: Many docs do not give them out in big ammounts as bacterias all over the world start to get resistant. And that will be a big problem once.

I don't agree here. They just assume everything is a virus. Tests are not done because they cost money, but then they guess wrong.

true,faglmt,sicilia,null,"Un po' come il cambio euro/dollaro, il bitcoin e litecoin (per le altre monete c'è bisogno spesso di fare prima un passaggio stile COIN -&gt; BTC -&gt; USD/EUR), ci sono fluttuazioni sul tasso di cambio, ovvero il valore che assume il bitcoin in confronto al dollaro, o viceversa.

Tenendo conto di questo, immagina un'onda sinusoidale, con alti e bassi, lo scopo è comprare  basso, in modo da avere un cambio favorevole, e avere più bitcoin possibile, e rivendere alto, in modo da far valere di più il bitcoin e avere più dollari col cambio.

Il tutto viene condito con la frequenza dell'operazione, o con il volume delle operazioni. Più sono frequenti, o più sono ampi i volumi, e più sarà il guadagno.

Ovviamente ci sono casi in cui fattori esterni influenzano di moltissimo l'andamento, esempio la recente chiusura della cina al cambio bitcoin / YUAN, permettendo di cambiare i bitcoin in yuan, ma non di cambiare yuan in bitcoin.

La cina ha pesato circa 200 dollari sul valore del bitcoin, che poco dopo il black friday (dove c'è stato il boom sul valore btc), si attestava ad una media stabile di fluttuazione giornaliera tra 800 e 900 dollari.
Adesso siamo a 600-700.


Si può giocare anche senza tenere conto del dollaro, ma utilizzando altre cryptocurrencies, come le neo nascenti feather coin, o la recentissima dogecoin, sta a te decidere di quale fidarti per un investimento.

Puoi iniziare a dare un occhiata su uno dei trader più diffusi per visualizzare l'andamento e capire qualcosa sui grafici: http://btc-e.com/ , rivale del più famoso mt.gox, ma che ti permette di giocare su molte più monete, e soprattutto sul litecoin.

Le varie catene come Mondadori, Feltrinelli &amp;co con i loro sconti miserrimi e inservienti non proprio sempre preparatissimi (o almeno in queste catene a me sembra spesso così) hanno come target il lettore occasionale o quello che decide di optare per un libro invece che per una fetta di parmigiano quando deve scegliere un regalo.

Imho, c'è tantissimo spazio per chi voglia aprire qualcosa di diverso come hanno fatto a Saronno, anche se non sono d'accordissimo sul taglio, io più che su Lella Costa (o qualsiasi altro incontro con autori a scopi commerciali) o iniziative estemporanee come la raccolta fondi, punterei di più sulla professionalità degli addetti, tipologia di libri disponibili (nuove uscite in minima parte) e sulla fidelizzazione dei clienti tramite gruppi di lettura all'americana, percorsi di approfondimento, iniziative culturali anche se non strettamente legate alla lettura (brevi o lunghi corsi di x, gruppi di discussione periodici/meetup ospitati dalla libreria). E soprattutto, date la possibilità di bere almeno un caffè all'interno, se volete che la gente si trattenga a lungo e che col tempo magari si formi un gruppo di clienti ricorrenti. 

Se ci fosse tutto questo, io sinceramente degli sconti praticati altrove me ne sbatterei.

The place where the guy of the homoeopathic pills and hot tea is highly rated in websites about my city and his praxis is completely full.

The one we currently have is usually not full. I guess it has something to do with being a woman, with a turkish surname and a physical disability. But she has been great. She does not spend half an hour with us, but you don't feel like they want to dump you in two minutes.

Reading is hard. Let me explain: usually when you get to the end of a sentence, you're supposed to continue to the next sentence, not stop reading altogether. If you had continued reading like an intelligent and literate person, you would have received a pretty eloquent explanation for your question: ""You don't think that producing a calendar with a bunch of naked women would have any effect on the opportunities and equal treatment of women in the workplace and how they're viewed and talked about by coworkers? Image and professionalism are important in businesses and this one fell short on both.""

It's ok. I know you tried. Just remember next time: continue on to the next sentence. Repeat that to yourself as a mantra if you must. It will help you avoid embarrassing situations like this in the future. Maybe by the next time we meet, you will have read an entire book for the first time in your life. I believe in you.

&gt;The women in the calendar made a conscious decision to be in the calendar.

They sure did. Nobody is disputing that.

&gt;Don't wimmin have a thought process to make choices for themselves.[1]  

Yes they do. Nobody is disputing that.

&gt;Were they raped into making the calendar ???

No they more than likely were not. Nobody said anything even close to resembling a suggestion that that could possibly in a million years be the case. Maybe you should work a little more on your reading comprehension skills and a little less on your ""being a snarky prick"" skills. The latter seem pretty well developed already.

&gt;Femen show their boobs even in a catholic church, and you don't bat an eye...but make a calendar...all male feminists lose their minds

Again, it's not the mere fact that this is a calendar that people are finding problematic. Nobody thinks the models were being mistreated or tricked. You've completely missed the point and you should be embarrassed. (BTW, most western feminists, SRS included, dislike FEMEN just as much as redditors do. Trust me, we did indeed ""bat an eye"" when they did that.)",0,1388340874,null,0,1388341164,0,cecnnnv,t3_1tvgiz,t1_cecnnnv,t1_cecikrm,null,1427943592,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

In Spain, most of the first line of health care are not hospitals or praxis but ambulatory centres. That is a collection of doctors and specialists in one building. You can share resources like expensive equipment much better like this and doctors are not paid per visit but a fixed good salary. I told my wife&gt; ""yeah but I guess you have to wait X hours"". We had a small incident while in Spain and it worked very well. I had to admit defeat.

In Santiago the Chile they used to have public transport where buses from the same line belonged to different companies and they were paid by passenger transported. Guess what happened? RACES!. Buses raced to get to the next stop first. black-market watchers standing on intersections giving the driver intelligence information about how far away the next stop was. This is happening in Germany with the doctors. The per-patient thing is a bad incentive and it would make more sense that the doctors are employed by someone.

true,mars20,null,null,"My ideas for northern bavaria:

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.

* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.

* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)

* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.

* [Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!

* In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.

* Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 

* [Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.

* [Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.

* [Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 

* [Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing

* In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!

* Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

* ADIDAS and PUMA have their headquarters and big outlet shopping centres in the small town of Herzogenaurach, 25km north-west of Nuremberg. If you want to go shopping for cheap sportswear (and more), you should consider a visit. Also if you are interested in [modern](http://www.vb.com/puma/puma-hq-herzogenaurach-m.jpg) [architecture](http://www.herzogenaurach.de/typo3temp/pics/e9cc906d7d.jpg).

**Bamberg:**

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  

* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.

* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the [""Alte Hofhaltung""](http://www.emiksch.de/Lions/2007/Bilder/slides/Bamberg_Alte_Hofhaltung.jpg) where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)

* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""

* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above

* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.

* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.

* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.spezial-keller.de/index_files/stacks_image_44.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.

* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.

* Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

* Bamberg is a University Town with currently about 12k Students (at 70k people), so you'll find young people everywhere.

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recommend ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**

* [Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here

* [Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)

* Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

* The University of Würzburg has about 25k students enrolled, the city if full of them ;)

**Bayreuth:** 

* [The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)

* [The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

* Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live (0,5 litre of beer: beginning at 1,50€), and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car, but there are is a list of [bus lines](http://vgn.de/freizeitlinien/) (german link) that are esp. for recreational/free time destinations like wildlife parks or hiking from may 1st till november. Click ""herunterladen (PDF)"" to download a pdf with a map and images to see what to expect and maybe use google translate (google translate did not work on the homepage when I tried it, so i recommend the pdf ""workaround""). Here is a [map of the region with public transport lines](http://www.vgn.de/ib/site/documents/media/f387bb36-6624-65dd-c17b-5cde6c7b84f4.jpg/VG_Freizeit_Prospekt.jpg) that are interesting for tourists, green are regular routes, purple routes are weekend and holiday only and only in the summer while orange are weekend only during the whole year. If you need help to find the right trip, message me and I'll translate and help you to find the busses etc.

* [Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremberg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle (well, actually two castles) there and live there. 

* [Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.

* The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.

* At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.

**Traditional Food** you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

**Breweries I would recommend, although all are great:**

* Brauerei Wagner in Merkendorf
* Brauerei Goldener Löwe in Buttenheim (where the Levi Strauss museum is)
* Schlenkerla in Bamberg (The Rauchbier - that means Smoked beer- is a famous speciality, tastes like bacon) 
* Fässla in Bamberg
* Grasser in Huppendorf
* Klosterbrauerei in Weissenohe (founded 1050, one of the oldest breweries in germany, great food also!)

(Typical beer types in the region are ""helles"" and ""dunkles"", but also ""Märzen"" or ""Bockbier"") 

**Some Festivals in the Region:**

* [Sandkirchweih Bamberg](http://www.sandkerwa.de/startseite/) 22.-26. August

He was starting a new tour with his brand new one man show, and suddenly all venues would close their doors to him. At that time, he had not started trolling the media. 

I remember seeing him in a fancy parisian nightclub (Le Baron, which is/was incidentally operated by two Jews, just to tell you how antisemitic he is) two weeks after that skit. It looked like his wife and a friend had tried to cheer him up by having him go out. He was sitting on a bench, looking absolutely dejected. I tapped his shoulder, ""I agree with you"" I told him. He looked at me briefly, nodded, and kept looking at the ground. 

Then he decided he would have none of it. He started troll-bating the media, upping the ante with every occasion. He decided that if he was treated like Le Pen, then he might as well talk to him. He happens to be the kind of man who doesn't take injustice silently. He fights back. 

Today he can't get on TV to promote his shows, he gets slandered daily, but he is without a doubt the most successful comedian in the country. He owns a comedy theatre in Paris, where his shows are packed. His national tours are fully booked weeks in advance. But of course, what you hear from our collabora-zionist government and media is that he's worse than Hitler or something.

Naja, das ist einfach schlusszufolgern. Denn du wuerdest das Programm garantiert nicht verteidigen, wenn es dir nicht gefallen wuerde. Und da es dir gefaellt, faellst du in die Gruppe, auf die es zugeschnitten ist.

&gt; Denn jemand, der einfach nur viele Akademiker in der Familie hat muss damit nicht hausieren gehen bei Diskussionen im Internet.

Ich wollte dir nur die Hintergruende vermitteln, warum ich meine Meinung vertrete. Das hat nichts mit ""hausieren gehen"" zu tun.

&gt; Ich will dir nur klarmachen was für einen Mist du von dir lässt,

Mir ist schon klar, dass du glaubst, ich wuerde Mist reden. 

&gt; mit sowas macht man sich nämlich meist unbeliebt [...] und vielleicht willst du das in deinem Leben ändern.

Soll ich jetzt luegen/die Unwahrheit schreiben, nur damit ich im Internet beliebter werde und Karmapunkte bekomme? :)

&gt; sieht man auch an den anderen Antworten auf dein Kommentar

Verwundert nicht, denn das Fernsehprogramm zielt eben auf den Durchschnittsbuerger ab. Kein Wunder also, dass die Mehrheit sich da angegriffen fuehlt und auch negativ kommentiert.

&gt; Ich glaube du bist dir über deine Fremdwirkung nicht ganz klar, wenn du denkst, dass dein erster Kommentar ohne Wertung ist oder wenn du anderen Leuten antwortest, dass du das nicht 'wertend' meinst. So funktioniert Kommunikation nicht.

Doch, doch. Ich bin mir im klaren, dass ich bei Menschen anecken werde, die vom Fernsehprogramm auf der emotionalen Ebene abgeholt werden (Stichwort: Gehirnwaschmaschine). Dennoch kann ich da keine Ruecksicht drauf nehmen und die Fakten verdrehen.

Meine Hoffnung ist nur, dass ich vielleicht ein oder zwei Leute aufwecke und sie erkennen, dass massloser Medienkonsum eben nicht alles ist. Dass das Leben aus mehr besteht, als der Programmchef bei RTL 2 oder ARD einem zugestehen mag.

No, most of the things are not German but Mediterranean. I find that here in the UK you can find a lot of amazing international things. Most supermarkets offer a wide selection of Chinese and Indian spices and ingredients for example, which I couldn't find in Germany.

However, in Germany you will find many things that originate from Southern Europe e.g. Turkey and were adapted (and amended) by and for the German market. 

So this is what I got:

Mediterranean and Turkish goodies:
Fladenbrot (the dictionary says ""pitta"" but pittas here look somewhat different....), Ajvar, stuffed chili peppers, Yufka dough

Then there are a couple of (light) cheeses I like to take with me because they are not available in the UK. That does not mean there is no cheese here but especially the light cheeses (mostly cheddar) are really not very good so I usually pick up things like: Light Limburger, Light Camenbert and Light Tilsiter, Bergkäse etc.

Then some sandwich spreads and cold cuts: Leberwurst (simply like it better than what I can get here), Teewurst, Turkey Salami, Turkey Mettwurst, Pork Mettwurst

And some bits and pieces: Maggi sauces, Quark, Haribo, Glühwein, Heineken (its cheaper, that's all), Whiskey (also cheaper - my boyfriend gets the ""cheap"" stuff to drink with coke every now and then), Truffle butter, Bread rolls (Brötchen), Spätzle &amp; Detmolder for a friend

I'm not quite sure why you say it is low-quality food. It is the same stuff I bought when I lived in Germany so I had some time to compare things and its just what I liked the most.

But maybe I'm just a low-quality kind of girl ;)

&gt; Non, là c’est un Topol RS-12M, (SS-25 en dénomination OTAN) avec une portée de 10 000 km et 550 kT « seulement ».
Les SS-25 datent du milieu des années 80, ils arrivent en fin de vie.

&gt; Ca n’empêche pas que les Russes viennent de faire un tir avec l’un d’entre eux depuis une base du côté d’Astrakhan sur une cible-test située au Kazakhstan, ce vendredi 27 décembre.
D’où certainement la chouette idée de cette carte (c’est celui qui a été tiré ?), façon bras d’honneur...

&gt; Ce sont effectivement les Topol-M, (ou SS-27 « Stalin » en langage OTAN, ça fait tout de suite plus méchant. Le nom russe Topol, ironie ou poésie slave, veut dire : « peuplier ». On voit moins le couteau entre les dents) qui vont les remplacer tous. La charge serait toujours de 550kT en version « standard », mais pourrait carrément aller jusqu’à 1MT en version « kitée » velue, et cette fois bien avec une portée de 10 500 km.
(Les SS-25 ont un « nez » en ogive comme un suppositoire, comme sur la carte de voeux, alors que les SS-27 ou les RS-24 Yars qui vont prendre la suite sont « taillés en crayon » avec un « nez » parfaitement conique).

true,[deleted],null,null,"You're right. The language is indeed related to Czech and Polish, and very similar to the Czech language, though it often also includes many German words, due to its close proximity to the German people and culture.

But herein lies the dilemma: Many sorbians practically never learn the language natively, be it from their own family, or schools. I think the last sorbian school was closed some time in the 50s, or 60s. And ever since, the language is only loosely documented.

Mind you, it's in no way a language genocide, the way it happened in, say, ireland, where irish was effectively suppressed. It's just that even if I'd learn the language, I'd never find any situation where it might come in handy. In fact, sorbian is listed as dying language in Europe. Unfortunately, this is a fate that affects many cultural enclaves in Europe, many of which have existed for hundreds, or even thousands of years.

I personally think that the wellbeing of the people has a higher priority than its language, hence why I find it important to keep it in the minds of the people, but I wouldn't enforce it in any way, if there's no good reason to do so.

The main problem I found after the NSA leaks is that there aren't any European service providers worth a damn, and then I thought to mYself, where is European added value? I could not think of a European company that boomed in the last 20 years of internet developent, almost all of our big companies are old comapnies, because westerners have focused on keeping old industry alive by subsidies and leave little to no money for new technology startups. New tech works, its worked from brooklyn to Bahrain, but european politicians are under pressure by traditional industry to artificially keep them alive. It is the job of local politics to say fuck you America, we can build a local amazon, a local gmail, a local paypal, that is faster, cheaper and works better than yours(please replace audible). I don't want to make bets, but you should keep an eye on the development of new tech in the baltic states and Portugal, they left the old behind and are striving to become incubators for new industry that can service all of Europe, and maybe even China and India, why not take their money.

No form of protection can be implemented against cheaper labor, what you need is production capabilities that make your labor more efficient. As in: logistical cost + 10 chinese workers become more expensive than an automated production line manned by 3 Swedish workers. You want the benefits of globalisation you need the cost to, protectionism is expensive and ineffective(unless you're an island nation like the UK or Cuba). 

And about that free ride, you need to understand that globalism is encouraged by western capitalist societies not out of pity, but out of self interest, those cheap workers make a western company competitive, not only at home, but all over the world. In fact being able to produce a scalable economy(more products means less cost per individual product) is making western companies so competitive they absolutely destroy any local competition in weaker economies. And literally make producers import the products they manufacture. This is why you have Coke costing less that water in africa, clothes produced in SE Asia sent back as foreign aid and so on. Or Ikea furniture(sorry to use such a cliche but it fits the bill) made from Romanian wood(via hungary and illegal deforestation) being cheaper than traditional furniture manufacturers that go out of business, leaving Ikea not only the cheapest alternative but the only option.

The thing with society is, it rarely returns to a previous equilibrium, kinda like rivers. You can't really do anything about it, unless there is an international force majeure that somehow changes individual values and expectation; you can however steer society to a better more equitable future, take the present and build a future on it.

Do all of those people have jobs? houses? pay taxes? respect your rights? If the answers to any of these is no, deport their asses, if it's yes to all, I don't agree with your point of view.

Con un hardware cosi' puoi minare decentemente qualsiasi moneta Scrypt, quindi Litecoin e Dogecoin e compagnia ma niente Bitcoin. Ma c'e' gente che si compra dei server con 4 o 5 schede video da 300 o 400 euro l'una.

A questo punto: se fra 6 mesi, per un qualsiasi motivo, tutte le monete Scrypt perdono completamente valore? E' impossibile prevederlo con certezza.

Stesso discorso se fra 3 mesi Dogecoin e Litecoin tornano a 3 dollari l'uno, senza che nasca una nuova Altcoin. Se non hai venduto per tempo, ti ritrovi in mano pochi spiccioli.

Poi c'e' la complessita' del mining della moneta: se la complessita' sale esponenzialmente, piu' il tempo passa piu' sara' difficile minare 1 Litecoin, piu' tempo ci vorra' per minare 1 Litecoin, meno Litecoin si guadagneranno al mese. Questo cosa significa? Che in futuro bisognera' tenere aggiornato l'hardware, quindi l'investimento avra' dei nuovi costi aggiuntivi, che ipoteticamente non finiranno mai.

C'e' anche l'aspetto pratico: devi tenerti in casa un server che ciuccia almeno 1000W e scalda fino a 80 gradi a scheda.",0,1388350631,null,0,false,0,cecrq5e,t3_1ty1hu,t1_cecrq5e,t1_cecrf9b,null,1427941622,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

It doesn't help that the large US companies have a propensity for offering lots of cash to the few European companies and buying them up.

&gt; I would trust non-US companies a bit more, because we can assume that it would be easier for the NSA to gain access to internal documents from US based companies, either through some form of ""national security letter"" or because American employees would be more willing to cooperate with them,

Minare diventerà sempre più difficile, oggi lo è troppo affinché sia fattibile con un buon profitto.

- Madrid can get VERY hot from april to october. 68ºF to 113ºF. Bring summer clothes, or even better, buy them here. Summer clothes are cheap.

- Dont go crazy with clothes, not every boy or girl wears ""halfnaked"" for partying or classes. Be yourself, stay confident with your style. Better be a confident american than a insecure spaniard.

- Party hard. Partys are great but not the only great thing, do everything, Spain has plenty to offer.

- Meet natives. Its easy, they are very openminded and interested in foreigners.

- Slang is easy, most of the people dont use it. There is very little slang that is not used EVERYTIME, and you learn that really fast. 

Thats pretty much it, if any new tips come to mind, i will write it here.

true,anarchistica,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; Mass-murder for profit is not genocide? So the Jews gassed in Auschwitz are genocide victims (as long as they were poor) but the Jews worked to death for IG Farben and all the other German companies or the rich Jews that got their property stolen were not. 

No, it isn't. The goal wasn't to profit from Jews, that was just a convenient way to get rid of them.

&gt; That's the result of your definition.

Actually, i took a course called ""Holocaust en genocide"", taught by [dr. Hondius](http://www.let.vu.nl/nl/organisatie-van-de-faculteit/wetenschappelijk-personeel/medewerkers-alfabetisch/medewerkers-e-k/dr-d-g-hondius/index.asp) (who also works for the Anne Frank Huis). Feel free to tell her how wrong she is about genocide. &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

And, of course, [the UN defined genocide](http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/cppcg/cppcg.html) as follows:

*acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group*

So, also feel free to tell the UN how wrong they are.

By the way, about my original point:

* u/Tetradax said: ""Germany is a great nation with a great history, and just because of 12 years nobody can't show it anymore?""

* I replied: ""Not like the Germans commited any other genocides in the first half of the 20th century...""

Which didn't stop the Russians from test firing one of them from a base near Astrakhan on a testing target in Kazakhstan this Friday 27th, the nice idea of the holiday card (could be the one they fired?) probably came from there, middle finger-style. 

The Topol-M (NATO reporting name SS-27 ""Stalin"", which does sound quite nasty. In respect to Slavic poetry, or pure irony, the Russian word Topol means *populus* (the tree). The knife is less visible...) is indeed the one bound to replace them all.

The similarity to china refers mainly to the fact that it seems that the government priority seems to be cheapen labour in order to attract foreign investment, hopefully making spain the manufacturing center of europe. A deeper analysis can be found [here](http://cib.natixis.com/flushdoc.aspx?id=73359) 

in this scenario abortion works twofolds: it strips women of a right of their own, also decreasing the chances to be part of the active workforce and increases poverty, hence reducing the negotiation power of workers.

it is probably a bit of a far fetched reasoning, but if you take into account all the previous laws this government has voted for, it seems to make perfect sense. It is actually coming out for what truly is, a old school fascists right wing non-liberal government which seems to be light years away from any other european right wing neoliberal party.

Alles, was SPD und CDU hier wollen, ist sich ein wenig mehr Spielraum zu schaffen, um abseits von Talkshows und Politbarometer regieren zu können. Ob das wirklich funktionieren wird ist eine komplett andere Sache, ich bezweifle es doch sehr stark.

Wenn man ernsthaft Reformen am System der repräsentativen Demokratie vornimmt mit der Begründung, dass der Status Quo die Bevölkerung überfordert und auslaugt, dann kann man auch gleich mit dem ganzen System aufhören. Das ist ein äußerst undemokratischer Gedanke, der zu Ende gedacht genausogut bedeuten kann, dass man Vorauswahlen abhält, um den endgültigen Wahlzettel kürzer werden zu lassen.

Schließlich hatten wir dieses Mal ganze zwei Dutzend Parteien auf dem Stimmzettel, eindeutig zu viel für den dummen Bürger, also bitte ab nächstes Mal alle Parteien unter 2% oder 4% oder 5% oder 10% in eine Vorwahl.

Nein, das ist doch alles nur ein Versuch das zu bekommen, was Peer Steinbrück vor dem Wahlkampf von der SPD-Basis verlangte: Beinfreiheit.

.The year 1874 saw the first wave of an immigration of German-speaking Russian Mennonite to south-central Kansas. The move was an attempt to preserve religious heritage and freedom after exclusion from military service was rescinded. During the next decade, one-third of Mennonites in Russia moved to North America. In 1874 a large portion of the Russian village of Alexanderwohl immigrated en masse to the United States aboard the ships Teutonia and Cimbria. This group split into two groups, the Alexanderwohl group sailed on the Cimbria then located around present day Goessel, and the Hoffnungsau group sailed on the Teutonia then located around present day Buhler and Inman.[10]",0,1388359099,null,0,false,0,cecvhoh,t3_1tywm2,t1_cecvhoh,t1_cecuoc5,null,1427939865,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2
true,mihrazet,SVAK,Slovakia,"&gt; That's like saying all Christians would fit in with Poles or that because there are ""christian states"" in the West that Christians all around the world should move there.

That's a stupid argument, because both Jews and Poles are an ethnicity, there is no reason Poles should accept aliens based only on their religion. The same goes for Jews. Jews in Israel even test genetically people who want to make aliyah to make sure they're ethnic Jews.

And if it isn't already obvious to you, Jews parasite on the society on all levels. Haredi Jews (the typical ghetto ones with hats) use the classical way, which means cheating, defrauding and abusing welfare. The secular and rich ones use their influence to gain more power and their power to control the general society. They for example control the media, have interests in national politics etc. Then it's no wonder the society reacts so strongly on perceived antisemitism - the Jews who pull the strings could get very angry.",0,1388359101,null,0,false,0,cecvhpf,t3_1twpm2,t1_cecvhpf,t1_cecv3x7,null,1427939864,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

You need a lot of stuff to line up - an existing large market, financial capital, Incentives, existing clusters etc.etc. to get a 'critical mass'. This doesn't exist in Europé. We like to pretend though that it does in Berlin or London.  And since this is true we can't go about bleeding firms to Asia. The German Middlestadt model is the one we have to follow in Europé (were it is possible).

The EU could do a lot to say fuck you to the US, but we're far to busy with regioanl funds and the CAP. That is the problem, that Europe is kinda a prisoner of some countries that won't change even if you'd put a gun to their heads.

But this conflict was spawned by a violent crackdown on peaceful demonstrations. Assad is the root cause of this conflict. 

Personally, as things currently are, if I was *forced* to align myself to a faction, it would be Assad. But only because the people who he's fighting are a worse alternative; Islamic fundamentalists, terrorists of all stripes, the KSA - nobody I'd like to see with more influence. 

While Assad is a bad guy, we must remember at the same time before his foolish and thuggish move to suppress the population as if this was the 20^th century, he also did offer ""free"" elections years down the line. We've all seen repeatedly throughout history what happens when a population demands change too quick; The Belgian withdrawl from the Congo is a prime example. 

I think when we come down to it, we're stuck in a situation that no foreign involvement can fix. What we need to do as sympathizers to the Humanitarian crisis is to donate money to aid organizations working in and around the region; Primarily in Lebanon which is trying to cope with the humanitarian situation but is simply not equipped to handle the scale of the disaster.

His career was also extensive, being the second-longest F1 career of any driver.

Senna, on the other hand, was also legendary. He was probably the fastest ever, absolutely dominating the series until his tragic death.

Es geht immer nur um einfacher, einfacher, einfacher.  

&gt; Erstens weil Firmen diesem kranken Ideal der ewigen Expansion in einem begrenzten Raum hinterherlaufen, selbst wenn der Markt längst gesättigt ist. Und das führt dazu, dass die Zielgruppe immer mehr Leute aus den Randbereichen aufnehmen muss.  
Und zweitens, weil der Dunning-Kruger-Effekt dazu führt, dass dümmere Menschen (ohne das jetzt zu werten) selbstsicherer sind als sie sollten, und deswegen lauter und einfordernder sind.  
Also verzerrt sich die Expansion nach unten. Es wird immer mehr darauf fokussiert, noch dümmere einzufangen.  
Eigentlich OK, denn weil jemand weniger intelligent denkt oder weniger schnell rennt hat er ja nicht weniger Rechte.  

&gt; Doch wenn man etwas so einfach macht, dass 90% der Gruppe massiv unterfordert sind, dann sieht die Natur die Chance, das Denken einfach einzusparen. Ist ja Verschwendung.

true,globaltyler,GERM,Germany until further notice,"&gt; No, it isn't. The goal wasn't to profit from Jews, that was just a convenient way to get rid of them.

You are trying to change the facts so that they fit into your interpretation of the definition.

We are talking about an industrialized process with loads of people and companies involved. You're telling me all of them had only one goal, to get rid of the Jews? Dresdner Bank wanted to get rid of Jews, so they lend the Nazis the money to build concentration camps? Allianz insurance wanted nothing more than to get rid of Jews, so they insured said concentration camps?
Or let's talk about ""Arisierung"" of businesses. Someone who buys a business from his former boss or from a competitor for dirt cheap (which that one is forced to ""sell"" because the government thugs will otherwise just take or torch it) has only the goal of destroying the religious group this former boss or competitor belongs to? Sorry that is just completely unrealistic.

All those people or companies had as main goal completely other things than destroying a religious group.

Still we both agree that they took part in a genocide. The difference is: you just claim that their goal was not profit/business but the destruction of the Jews instead. In my profession we call that ""squeezing the facts"" and it doesn't work. I argue differently.

&gt; And, of course, the UN defined genocide as follows:

Yeah, so does my government - [§6 VStGB](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vstgb/__6.html) but as it is a legal code it is open to legal interpretation. 

There are multiple legal ways to define *intent* for instance. Usually they involve the knowledge part and the will part, you have to have the knowledge that something is going to happen if you do something and you have to have the will to make that happen what is going to happen if you do something. And you have to decide which of those 2 is more important. I say it is the knowledge part because the will element might focus on a different result and suddenly you have trouble proving intent because the will element you need is only a tiny part of a big bundle of motivations.

**TL;DR:** *I say intent in case of genocide is already given if you know that your actions will (partly) destroy a national, ethnical, racial or religious group even if your will is (only) on making a lot of money, as long as you willingly accept that the destruction of said group will happen.*

That's why I say that the IG Farben executive who's main goal was not the destruction of a religious group but a high bonus for achieving a lot of production via forced labour but who knew that heaps of people will die from his actions was part of a genocide as well as the rubber merchant in Congo who realized that killing whole villages if the forced labour quotas were not fulfilled meant the partial destruction of a ethnical group but did not want to destroy them mainly but took it as necessary to achieve a high revenue. The scale and the way of genocide was different (that is the reason the holocaust is special, because it was actually a whole genocide industry and that is the monstrous thing about it) but in effect it is both genocide. At least in my interpretation of the legal term *intent* in the UN definition of genocide.

&gt; So, also feel free to tell the UN how wrong they are.

I am pretty sure people have already done so, but that is neither here nor there at the moment.

&gt; You agree with him that it's just the years under Hitler were bad and that it's ok if you commit genocide against black people?

* Unlimited immigration from the EU means that we have to make it very difficult for non-EU immigrants to gain citizenship because we're an island with limited space and resources and there's a finite number of people we can take in. I feel that people from the Commonwealth Realms (IE Australia, Canada, New Zealand) have a greater claim to live here than many European nations since we share a head of state, langauge and a large amount of culture, yet they have to jump through all kinds of hoops and checks when somebody from a country that has far less shared history can come here no questions asked.

* Unwanted and unneeded changes that sound like a good idea overall but are horrible locally. The biggest example I can think of is forcing metrication on the UK. There was never any real desire from the British public to use metric units but they were forced from the top down and now we have a messed up hybrid system where some things are metric and some things are imperial. It should have been left as it was, most of us still use imperial units informally anyway.

with a view to eliminating... anti-feminism and homophobia"". I'm solidly against discrimination in all it's forms but to put such wide lables on things like ""homophobia"" and ""anti-feminism"" could easily trample all over the toes of religious freedom and freedom of speech in the name of ""tolerance"".

Believe me the only difference is that Americans encourage development and we stick with old companies. Yes there are regional factors and politics but what it boils down to is that they aren't afraid of risk.

Every country has skeletons in their closet, that even its citizens don't know about, why do you think the euro was rushed, why do you think paris insists on regional development or the UK still remains in the EU despite the political divergence. In 10-20 years you won't be able to blame the east, and most of the south,, and then you will still be reliant on 20th century industries and complain about not being competitive, because the policy has to change, companies don't need government to hold their hand, and if they do, they don't deserve to occupy the market and should move out of the way and let new, more dynamic companies fill in the gap.

Actualy Friedman argues for shareholders to be contractually binded to the company for longer periods of time, so they don't think short term.

 It wasn't outsourcing, it was time, you can't maintain a company in the long term if you don't adapt, think about how much our consumer behavior changed only in the last 5 years. Economics isn't some dark art created by our corporate overlords, its an behavioral pathern shaped by society, it is generated by people and people change, you can't expect companies not to and become dependant on subsidies because people don't want to change jobs.(another modern day problem)

Protectionism is useless in the long term. Consumers want global products, businesses require the most advanced contractor to be competitive. And nationalism is useless when it comes face to face with the will of individuals, even in Sweden, if you give it time.

My point stands, kick them out and offer them a hotel voucher for their next visit. This is my point, the emigration framework is broken, you can't expect a person to have no place to stay having no job and somehow by liberal voodoo integrate. Its not the concept but the way it is applied.

UKIP's being more astute and knows that whilst they might be against it in principle they for it in this instance because it will allow them to look to the other parties and say ""why didn't you do anything"" and be honest about it. Something non of the other parties can ever do on almost any issue.

Additionally, all three major parties are basically of the same ideology.

true,anarchistica,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; I've been arguing that Leopold II.'s Congo thing was genocide against the opinion that it was just mass murder for profit and you actually ask me that question?? Seriously? ...

I do apologise for tricking you, but since you're so obviously a layman i felt it was needed to get to the crux of the matter.

The term 'genocide' is quite loaded, like the term 'terrorism'. It is quite common for laymen such as yourself to mistake the term 'genocide' for a quantifier of the severity of a crime. It is not. 

Genocide has a very specific definition and is used for very specific instances of mass-murder. It isn't ""worse"" than mass-murder, it's simply different. 

The British have repeatedly starved tens of millions of Indians, as late as WW2. This is one of the worst crimes in history, pretty much the reason why i consider them the worst people in history. However, they did not intend to destroy the Indian people, so it isn't genocide. 

The intentions of separate groups or individuals acting under a regime which is committing genocide are irrelevant. The Kurds were most likely looking to gain land and gain legitimacy, but that does not mean the Armenian Holocaust wasn't genocide. The Osman Empire was determined to do away with pretty much any non-Muslims, which makes it genocide.

I consider Leopold II to be the most evil person in history, surpassing Stalin, Hitler, Mao, An Lushan, and Genghis Khan and his successors. He was responsible for the flight and death of as many as 12 million people, for turning villages on each other and for turning chopped-off hands into a currency. However, he was out for profit, not for the destruction of the people in his private possession Kongo Vrijstaat.

This is probably mostly due to that we don't really see ""Jews"" as a separate group.

Also, they didn't form a single group. Obviously, Sephardic Jews were much more involved in slave trade than the far less wealthy Ashkenazi Jews who came here later on.

The point about that is that while immigration may benefit ""the economy"" it doesn't benefit large swathes of poorer people who effectively have to compete with those immigrants for the same jobs. 

And for many years this wasn't a huge problem, but now it's becoming so for two reasons, 

1) the EU keeps enlarging and allowing in poorer countries, so one wave of immigration follows another which follows another, this constantly forces down wages at the low end of the market. 

2) Many countries inside the eurozone are effectively using emigration as a way of solving their employment problems by getting people to leave, the UK being one of the places they're going. Again causing more or less the same effect.

Whether you think UKIP are right or wrong on the issue, they're the only party that actually talk about it so they're the ones hoovering up the votes of the people fed up with the major parties who effectively have been ignoring the problem for a decade.

That may be, but a GP asked my SO to describe her symptoms instead of actually physically examining her. It would have been easier and more reliable (not everyone knows medical vocabulary) to quickly look things over. The diagnosis was correct in this case. 

This ""doctor"" had acupuncture books on the shelf. She went to this place because she needed a quick appointment given the situation was an emergency.

In other cases professionals have misdiagnosed things and receptionist staff have laughed at her.

&gt; The healthcare in Germany works.

I don't agree. I don't have much experience admittedly. 
I don't want to sound patriotic, but in New Zealand where I live the experience is much better.
The GPs are trained to a higher standard it would seem. They can diagnose most general issues without referring to an expert. The reception staff act professionally. GPs don't peddle bullshit like acupuncture and homeopathy. If they do, eventually they'll be punished for it. GPs spend an ample amount of time with a patient and don't just try to rush them out the door.
It's not perfect, dentists cost a fortune and I think waiting lists for cancer treatment can be long. However the GPs are at least competent. It's very important that diagnosis are done quickly and correctly. Germany just fails at this.

Il n'y a pas longtemps,j'ai vu ça sur un forum d'un autre site. 
J'ai longtemps hésité à partager une anecdote de vacance tant elle m'a troublé. 
Cet été dernier, j'ai passé des vacances dans le sud de la France. Durant la dernière semaine d'Août, je suis remonté dans le Nord par étape le long de la côte Atlantique. A chaque étape, je m'arretai faire du tourisme ou lézarder sur une plage. 
Je suis parti de Bordeaux le mardi vers 8h. Mauvaise idée! La circulation était très pénible. Je voulais atteindre Royan dans la matinée, c'était mal parti! Ensuite, je me suis perdu (Non, je n'avais pas de GPS!). Je n'avais rien mangé le matin (Pas bien!), j'étais donc sur les dents. Je demande mon chemin, on me fait passer par Saint Ciers sur Gironde et je vous le donne en mille... Des travaux! La route est barrée! Plus de deux que je roule, une pause s'impose. Il fait beau, je marche un pour me dégourdir les jambes. Mon oeil est attiré par un massif fleuri devant une mairie, un peu en retrait de la route. C'est calme! Le bruit des travaux est lointain. Je me pose dans un coin pour en profiter. Je me calme et fais le point : Vu comme c'est parti, je ne serais jamais à Royan avant midi. Pas grave! J'ai le temps, je suis en vacances. Je me repose. J'écoute les bruits ambiants, le chant des oiseaux, la porte de la mairie qui s'ouvre, un type qui enfourche son vélo, à nouveau la porte qui s'ouvre et le dévut d'une conversation à voix basse, objet de mon trouble. 
A : -""Il m'est venu aux oreilles que tu as refusé de mettre un logiciel."" 
B : - ""Oui, c'est exacte! Monsieur XXXXX m'avait demandé d'installer une licence pour un poste à la mairie à partir d'une licence de la Médiathèque. J'ai refusé car les licences des postes à la médiathèque ne sont pas transférables légalement!"" 
A : -""Et tu lui as demandé de mettre par écrit sa demande et il a refusé de le faire?"" 
B : -""Oui."" 
A : -""Et depuis tu ne reçoit plus de prime?"" 
B : -""Oui."" 
A : -""Et ça c'est passé quand?"" 
B : -""Il y a à peu près un an, ce n'était pas aux dernières évaluations, mais un peu avant les précédantes."" 
A : -""Tu en as parlé avec XXXX-XXXXX?"" 
B : -""C'est la première chose que j'ai fait! Prendre un rendez-vous avec Madame XX XXXXX."" 
A : -""Et alors?"" 
B : -""Elle m'a reçu mais... Rien!"" 
Un silence s'installe. Je fais quoi? Je manifeste ma présence? Je ne bouge pas et je garde le silence? Je crois que c'est ma curiosité qui l'a emporté. 
A : -""Je te demande ça parcequ'ilfaut que je sois sûr des faits."" 
La suite de la discussion porte sur des problèmes de box. 
Voilà, fini! Ils sont partis. Je reprend le volant, je quitte Saint Ciers. Ce que j'ai entendu m'a coupé l'appétit. Je me suis passé la conversation en boucle dans ma tête jusqu'à la fin des vacances. J'y repense régulièrement. Que faire? Qu'aurais-je dù faire? Je vous le demande... 
Je me suis amusé à faire deux-trois trucs marrants.

C'est quoi ce délire avec SAINT CIERS SUR GIRONDE?

http://www.noelshack.com/2013-51-1387322740-melinf.jpg

Je ne sais pas tortuelente. Mais j'avais déjà vu passé un truc comme ça (sur JoL, il me semble). Intriguant!

Une petite recherche google avec saint ciers sur gironde et médiathèque donne ça! 

http://www.sudouest.fr/2012/10/22/un-bapteme-sur-fond-de-querelle-politique-856847-639.php 

Y aurait du politique là-dessous?

Tiens Archimonde! Tu n'es plus sur Jol? Perso, cela ressemble plus à un incident local qu'à un problème politique. Mais les joliens ont toujours un avis tranché et rarement fondé ou étayé.^^ Tout ça, ce n'est que du théâtre façon shakespeare.

Archimonde tu as tellement fait une fixette sur la politique que tu n'as pas cherché au plus près. Si cela parle de la médiathèque Monsieur XXXXX c'est peut-être le directeur de la médiathèque

Au temps pour moi, le responsable de la médiathèque n'est pas un monsieur mais une dame du nom de Céline Sicet. 

http://ecla.aquitaine.fr/Annuaire-des-professionnels/Ecrit-et-livre/Bibliotheques-et-mediatheques/Bibliotheque-de-Saint-Ciers-sur-Gironde 

Alors il faut peut-être chercher plus haut dans la hiérarchie.

Plus haut dans la hiérarchie il y a le directeur général des services qui se nomme Bédlé. Ça pourrait être Monsieur XXXXX. Et XXXX-XXXXX pourrait être Anne-Marie comme dans Anne-Marie Plisson. 
http://www.sudouest.fr/2012/12/28/le-cabinet-medical-a-ouvert-920087-3092.php 

Alors Monsieur Bédlé c'est lequel sur la photo, dsephiroth le meilleur?  :sarcastic:

Grâce à tes liens (content?), on a les photos du maire et de l'élu. Il reste que ceux de droite et celui de gauche. Comme ceux de droite sont habillés comme des prolos, je dirais que c'est le type à gauche. 
Incline toi devant mon sens de déduction peu commun!  :-)))

Moi qui suis maintenant de Blaye, ça m’intéresse. Et le logo de la ville qui a changé ça a un rapport?

true,WilQu,null,null,"&gt; Je ne suis pas religieux et je préfère regarder/écouter des émissions religieuses que j'envisage sur un plan historique et culturel que Plus belle la vie ou le Bigdil. Au moins, je me dis que ça a une fonction sociale et que ça fait réfléchir les gens plutôt que de les endormir devant des feuilletons télé à rallonge. Dans un pays à culture chrétienne, effacer la connaissance de la culture religieuse à dessein, c'est couper les gens de leur propre culture. 

Si ces émissions avaient une dimension historique et culturelle, ça irait encore, mais de ce que j’en ai vu, ce n’est pas le cas. Pour ne parler que de la messe, elle n’est pas diffusée de temps en temps dans le cadre d’émissions culturelles, elle est diffusée chaque semaine, très clairement à destination des croyants catholiques.
&gt; Le problème de la laïcité, c'est que les anti-laïcards pensent que dès qu'il est question de religion, leur avis est obligatoirement sollicité. Et qu'il s'agit uniquement d'un avis pour ou contre. Ce n'est pas le cas. Et puis vas-y la mauvaise foi, ils sont aussi endoctrinés que les autres à ne pas croire ( merci l'EN ), et leur façon d'envisager la pluralité des opinions est extrêmement intolérante et d'un égoïsme affligeant

C’est effectivement ce que je déplore ici. Lorsque les religions s’expriment, on accorde généreusement le droit aux non-croyants le droit de ne pas y croire, mais alors de le faire en silence.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"Innocence is subjective. By being a tax paying citizen you are supporting your government in whatever it is doing. Period. 

Collateral damage is shitty. It's terrible that children get harmed and killed. That's the worst thing to ever happen in an act of violence like this. But every movement is a terror organization when it starts and there's always civilian targets at some point or another. 

Mandela's acts of terror were bombing civilians and school buses full of white children, and he's hailed as a man of peace. Michael Collins, the Irish revolutionary, put hits out on civilians all the time, and he's loved by us. Castro rounded up and imprisoned or killed all those who opposed his Socialist/Communist ideals, and there are people all over the world who support him, let alone the Cubans. And that's just getting started. 

The old adage applies here; One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Russian Imperialism is the root cause of these terror attacks. The First &amp; Second Chechnyan Wars, the subsequent oppression of Nationalist movements in the Caucasus regions has lead to the rise of Islamist Radicalism in Chechnya, Dagestan, and so on. The involvement in Syria does not held either, especially when you're facing people with the financial means of the Saudi Princes, who can fund terror attacks forever. 

I know that if Ireland today was still under the rule of England, that we were denied our right to self determination, that the English people were supporting their government and what they were doing, that we were oppressed and denied our freedom, I would pull the trigger myself. Some people are willing to kill for their ideals, some are even willing to die for them, and while they're not right, they're not *wrong* either, and we can't judge right from wrong, from the outside because we can't possibly share their perspective or their experiences.

I've always made my opinion clear when it comes to independence movements; Every people has a *right* to self determination. I see the right to one's own country as a basic human right that is denied to too many all over the world. While terrorism is never the first option before peaceful and political negotiation, it should never be ruled out as ""evil"" or ""wrong"" when all else fails. And all else *has* failed in Russia. 

If we ruled out every resistance movement as ""evil"" or ""terrorism"" or ""wrong"", then you can say goodbye to the Irish Republican Army in the War of Independence, which was labelled by the British government as terrorists, you can say goodbye to the French Resistance in World War II, you can say goodbye to the United States of America, you can say goodbye to Poland, and pretty much most of Eastern Europe, let's not forget the Baltic States, either. Or the Scandinavian ones for that matter. You can say goodbye to Pakistan and India and Bangladesh. It's endless. 

So, yes, it's a horrible thing that people are being killed here, but let's not pretend the Russians are on the righteous side of good, or that we have an enlightened view of the conflict, or that the terrorists are good or bad guys, hell, despite my big response, I wont even pretend that I know I'm right. I'm just a guy with an opinion. We don't *know* who's doing these attacks and more importantly we don't know *why*. So, despite what's been said, let's not be stupidly emotional and sentimental and try to approach this violence from a more pragmatic or logical point of view before me make judgements.",0,1388402091,null,0,false,0,ced9vu4,t3_1tzwdc,t1_ced9vu4,t1_ced9ajl,null,1427933005,-22,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-22

true,globaltyler,GERM,Germany until further notice,"&gt; I do apologise for tricking you, but since you're so obviously a layman i felt it was needed to get to the crux of the matter.

Thank you for the insult.

Just because I am a bit rusty does not mean I am a layman. I haven't worked with criminal law in a few years, have never gone in-depth about international criminal law and I usually argue legally only in my native German, so in a lingua franca that is not as complex as my own it is sometimes different to actually bring the intended message across, just as if you're used to fence with a rapier that has a very small point and now I have to use a mace instead - a lot harder to only hit the small area you intended to - still I am a lawyer, so anything but a layman. 

Just because I come in from a different angle than you does not mean I am not qualified to talk about the subject. Indeed, since you are probably someone who ""only"" studied history, not law - I could argue that you are a layman because you are talking about legal terms like intent without legal knowledge, hence your fault of ""Sachverhaltsquetsche"" or squeezing the facts.

So let's accept that we view this from different academic disciplines and leave the insults out, shall we?

&gt; The intentions of separate groups or individuals acting under a regime which is committing genocide are irrelevant.

No. That is not how law works, unless you are the Nazis (""Sippenhaft"" comes to mind). Every individual is accountable for itself and has to have all points of a crime ""to its name"", either by having done themselves or via imputation but that is the most difficult for the mens rea (in this case the general intent necessary for any crime and the special intent to destroy) as these are internal in a person. As I would be repeating myself, see my previous post for the legal argument on how I see the mens rea of genocide fulfilled.

I know that my legal opinion on mens rea is not the ruling opinion in German jurisprudence (German high court does take a different opinion if I remember correctly) but that's not my problem, ruling opinion changes all the time, that's the essence of a living argument.",0,1388402877,null,0,false,0,ced9zsy,t3_1tw8z4,t1_ced9zsy,t1_ced0g8c,null,1427932954,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Its not taxes, its the sheer burden of risk, on new startups, and the focus of governments to maintain old traditional companies despite being uncompetitive on a global level.

Its not the actual company that generate jobs, but the ecosystem they support, around them. Thay also generate a healthy incubation for other future large companies(Silicon Valley effect), despite unattractive conditions: high labor cost/taxation(California).

According to Alan Greenspan the possibility for shareholders to bail on toxic deals is the reason the financial system lacks any form of measure and self control.

&gt;There is no reason for us to let them and shareholders lose on the expence of entire nations. This oes for to big to fail banks as well, they should be cut up.

Kinda confused but I agree, the problem is that modern governments need large banks, most of business2businees liquidy is done through banks and recently financed by them as well. So we kinda have to change the mindset of modern society to accept that for first tier countries 2% growth is great, and stop looking with envy on other models or emerging markets that get 5% in a bad year. The problem is we are greedy, and inpatient, and politicians are professional suck ups, they see a big red button that says increased liquidity, increased GDP and increased tax revenue and they press it, regardless of the side-effects along the road.... even if you have a technocrat, the people wont probably back him if his adversaries point out that there's a button that makes everyone richer and the technocrat doesn't use it.

I agree that its unacceptable, this is actually the subject of my thesis, markets naturally progress toward monopolies, and when they do reach a critical mass the social pressure they exert through their employees makes any government action objectionable.

Adding externalities as an opportunity cost will work for some people, but you still can't convince a consumer he should pay more for an inferior product because it helps a local CEO.

c'è sempre un ma. C'è il rischio di esagerare. Io personalmente se devo proprio lasciare la macchina in doppia fila rimango io dentro, in modo che posso togliermi dai cojoni se do fastidio. E se sono costretto è perché se devo aspettare che un mio amico scenda e questo ci mette dai 5 ai 10 minuti, io certo non ne giro almeno 15 per parcheggiare. Ecco, in questa casistica il bravo cittadino mi segnalerebbe, e a rigor di logica mi prendo la multa. Anche se l'alternativa sarebbe fare diecimila giri dell'isolato, inquinare di più, quando posso stare benissimo in doppia fila in una stradina secondaria ché non dà fastidio a nessuno, specialmente perché rimango sempre dentro per spostarmi in caso.

Typical of Brits to complain, typical of British media to talk controversy because it sells. Here are a couple of threads recently made on /r/UnitedKingdom that are about the positive things this country offers. Honestly, it's good over here. It's not the best country in the world, but it's good - I'd rather be here than southern or eastern Europe.

&gt; It is sickening me to read complains from Greeks whikle countries like Slovenia needs to participate in the bailouts for Greece. A country with a lower living standard than Greece. And yet people like you practically demand that those countries have to pay for your lifestyle, too? 

No? Did I say anything like that? The rich countries should help out the poor is my principle. At any rate, the ""sacrifices"" made by the creditor countries to ""bail out"" Greece are so small that it's laughable that people are indignant about it.

I'm not exactly sure, but I feel like the ECHR is very popular,seen as a human rights court. I think that any politician that would dare attack the Court would instantly kill any chances he might have to be elected for anything.

Honestly,I feel like if people read a few of the cases the Court has, they will have so much respect for it. I think that both the Convention and the Court are great, and one of the reasons why Europe is much more progressive in terms of human rights.It's really one of the best things in Europe,in terms of legality.

( source for ECHR case law : http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/Pages/search.aspx#{%22documentcollectionid2%22:[%22GRANDCHAMBER%22,%22CHAMBER%22]}  )

The only country I have ever heard complaints about it is the UK, and I find that extremely confusing. It's very ironic since as you pointed out ,it's something Churchill heavily supported after the end of WW II. 

I feel like the reason for the conflict between the UK and both the EU and ECHR is due to a different legal culture. Common law works differently than civil law, and there's been many cases where the European Courts stepped on the tail of the British Government. It's not even only the Courts, it's the Commission and the Parliament as well. Many of these conflicts are really about the conflict of how you do things in civil law and how you do things in common law.

The British government and politicians don't want to conform to something that's foreign and not british, and that they don't understand that well.

Just google ""US states by ...""
and replace ... with unemployment, [average income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income) and so on.
Besides this, the us has some geographical issues with the sparcely populated midwest, it relies heavily on the mississippi river and afluents to export its produce and the west coast ports of the us have trouble coping with exports and imports. Vancouver,Canada took the lead as the nr 1 port in the west coast by tonnage,ahead of LA or san francisco ports.

The us has a bigger [landlocked](http://www.worldcanals.com/image/usa.gif) area in comparison with the [EU](http://www.worldcanals.com/image/vneEurope.jpg).but it's mainly in the midwest so it doesn't matter that much.

Also, the EU integration of eastern countries with big populations like poland, romania and even the push for ukraine with its 40mil people coupled with the easygoing legislation and basically the removal of any hinderance in migration inside the eu makes sense.

Would you also say that is somehow also a moral failure of the people? Did people become suddenly immoral? Or is the problem at least partly systemic?

Of course there is a systematic failure. We use *debt money* after all. 
Every 5 year old should realize that our monetary syastem is not sustainable. Money is created with debt, and for every 100€ created the demands gets bigger than the amount of money which exists. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to realize that a reset is needed at somepoint. 
But that isn't the topic right now, is it? 

The sovereign country Greece is to blame for their current situation. Other countries decided to do other things. After Greece entered the Eurozone they could get cheap money and took more loans than can repay.  Greece didn't use those loans to reform their country, but to hire more public servant since your politicians promised as much as voting gifts and to enrich your elite even more. Germany could have done the same, but he did our reforms when the world economy wasn't struggling. It appears that it was the smart thing to do, something one cannot say about Greece. Greece needed similar reforms and could have done so when they had access to cheap money, instead of having a big ""party"" and wasting all the money.  Those reforms would still be painful but not as close as it is right now. It is your fault to wait that long to do the reforms. 

&gt;That's the fault of the Greek and the Greek system allright. That does not prove that the debt crisis is a result from that.

Countries refinance itself by taxing their population. If you avoid paying your taxes and still want a social safety net, your country need to take loans to do so. If the citizens of Greece decided to pay what they should and not to dodge taxes, the government wouldn't have needed to take as many loans to keep their country running. 

&gt;You know almost all countries did the same right regarding the Eurozone, right? Faking numbers is despicable but hardly unique to Greece. Just the other day we were talking here in /r/europe about how Germany fakes its unemployment numbers.

No I don't know that almost all countries did the same, in fact I am convinced that Greece was the only country who did so. 
Well the European commission is not blameless.  But the action started from Greece which decided that they need to have the Euro.  
Could you tell me which other countries lied to their partners about the criteria to enter the monetary Union? A lot of country did broke the rules, Italy's debt was bigger than it should, France and Germany (and many others) broke the deficit rule but none of those reported wrong numbers. I hope you see a difference in both actions. 
Also what has Germany unemployment numbers to do with it? 
How do they influence European neighbors? The numbers are lower because the German government have a definition about employment, most people disagree with, but they are not betraying their European partners with it. 

&gt;No? Did I say anything like that? The rich countries should help out the poor is my principle. At any rate, the ""sacrifices"" made by the creditor countries to ""bail out"" Greece are so small that it's laughable that people are indignant about it.

But that is what you demand! Greece wants a bigger debt reduction, which means that poorer countries will have to pay for it too. 
That is how it works in the EU, everyone needs to participate. Poorer nation who decided to play by the rules and not artificial increase their living standard  with more loans have to pay for the failure of Greeks who had decades of a lifestyle they couldn't afford. 

And your are kidding if you say that the hit the Creditors had to take is laughable, or? 
They were forced to write off [107 billions](http://www.dw.de/greek-creditors-receive-official-haircut-notification/a-15767530)! 53% of their investment! I assume only a 100% write off plus paying for your living standard is the only way to be not laughable?

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  I know I'm probably not going to convince you that the bailouts constitute predatory lending

No, you really won't. The crisis began when Greece had to reveal that its *primary* deficit (i.e., not even counting interest payments on existing debt) was about 10% of GDP, and private investors demand for interest on new loans went through the roof as a result (new loans wouldn't have only been for those 10%, but old debt that would have to be rolled over as existing bonds reached their maturity date). This means that without the bailout packages, even if all of Greece's debt would have magically disappeared over night, the same kind of budget cuts would have been necessary.  
As for ""predatory"", the interest rate Greece has to pay on those loans is equal to what the countries giving them have to pay in interest rates themselves. And as MadManWithTinFoil already mentioned, part of the package was a ""debt restructuring"" worth about €100bn. That's quite a significant reduction by anyone's standards.

No, of course those bailouts haven't been given for altruistic reasons. A full Greek default (i.e., beyond those €100bn) would have had enormous consequences far worse than the direct effects on Eurozone banks. Otherwise it would have been cheaper to bail those out directly; most of Greece's debt had been held by Greek banks, after all.

But to blame the current state of the Greek economy on the bailout conditions disregards the effects the crisis would have had without the bailouts. It doesn't even come close. What you're seeing now, bad as it is, is the effect of the budget cuts implemented over several years instead of over night, and with the Greek banking sector still functional instead of wiped out.

As for the ""more money, grow out of it"" alternative, that's essentially what Greece had ever since it entered the Eurozone. Greece had easy access to loans, at the same rates as the other Eurozone countries (average spread for 10Y bonds up until 2008 compared to German ones was 0.27%). Yes, the Greek economy grew, but the debt grew even faster and the deficit along with it. Reforms would have been necessary either way, but I just can't imagine a Greek government implementing them without the threat of irregular default hanging over it and the Troika as a scape goat to blame them on. Keynesianism is fine and good when you have a decently functioning economy in temporary trouble, but that's just doesn't describe the situation in Greece.

b)He's delusional. 

I don't really want to talk about God and his existance, but I think that person doesn't have to be stupid or delusional to believe in some kind of higher force. Nobody knows for sure if God exists, including you. Do you think that believing in God is more delusional that not believing in him? I don't think any of those options are delusional. If you're a Christian, that's doesn't make you delusional and it certainly doesn't make you stupid.

&gt;What I require for respect is my business completely, and while in some cases, if the person shows other great qualities, I might respect them, I don't like dumb people

I agree with you here, respect is a very subjective thing. I don't lose respect for people based on their religious beliefs, like you, because I think that's a bad thing. We shouldn't judge people based on just one thing, like their race, sexuallity or **religion**.

&gt;Tolerance is a good thing - let's tolerate terrorism then. Oh wait, it's not always a good thing, now is it.

Of course it's not always a good thing, but when it comes to religion, I think it is. Religion is not equal to terrorism. I agree that religion can sometimes have a bad influence on people, but that's not its purpose. Catholic Chruch, for instance, does a lot more good stuff than bad. Take a look at the new pope, did you lose respect for him too because he's religious?

true,flocosix,MOLD,Moldova,"&gt;Take a look at the new pope, did you lose respect for him too because he's religious?

I like the Pope, alright. But I don't know if he's religious (let's not just assume he is because he's the Pope, that's no guarantee). But he does deserve *some* respect for what he's doing (although it's exactly what somebody in his position should do -- we're just not used that it is actually done), I'll admit that. I'm not saying religiosity is automatically making you a piece of shit, but that's the case for most people I meet. He/she can be smart, excellent in his/her field, a great person. But in the end, it's a small person that believes in Santa Claus, you know? How do you come to look up to that? Sorry but no, this isn't working out. Maybe if you think about it as a crazy side, but otherwise, it's just childish and small.

&gt;but I think that person doesn't have to be stupid or delusional to believe in some kind of higher force.

I should've asked you this before you replied with this, but wouldn't you consider delusional somebody that believes, *actually* believes, that there are unicorns and dinosaurs on Jupiter? I bet you would. Same thing with the guy from the sky. Same thing with the guy that believes, actually believes and prays to the Aliens from the Area 51 -- he's a lunatic.

&gt;Do you think that believing in God is more delusional that not believing in him? 

Not beliving in God is logical. The number of things that we can believe in are infinite. Unicorns. Spaghetti Monster. Flying mutated humans. But we don't, know why? Because there are no signs of either of those, and we'd sure be losing time if we were all looking for the flying mutated humans for all of our lives and there would be priests that claimed they've talked to them and they told us that and that...

It's simple. No signs = no belief. We were selected this way as to not lose time and energy on unexistent things. 

&gt;If you're a Christian, that's doesn't make you delusional and it certainly doesn't make you stupid.

It most certainly does, we are just used to it. It's normal.

&gt; We shouldn't judge people based on just one thing, like their race, sexuallity or religion.

Sure, I judge on more things. I could even respect a serial killer, even though that would be a no-no for many people. I could respect a religious person too, but that person has to be exceptional to compensate for that.

&gt; I agree that religion can sometimes have a bad influence on people, but that's not its purpose. Catholic Chruch, for instance, does a lot more good stuff than bad. 

Everything that people do with religion and the church can and would be done without it too. There are secular alternatives, replace religion with education and correct values and ""what the church does"" with charities. 

There's a study that showed that Atheist people are generally more emphatic, they donate more blood, they're willing to help people more. I can look it up if you want to, but that was just the last drop in the argument that religion deserves any respect at all.

true,Syndane_X,GERM,Germany,"I must admit, in hindsight, I'm pretty glad that this whole economic mess has happened. Because it teaches ordinary citizens to not avoid paying taxes, to not ask for more money from the government irresponsibly, to not listen to politicians trying to bribe their way into office. I'm not sure if that impression will last, and it certainly didn't ring any alarm bells with our very own socialist believers, but I believe it made an impression that ""debt per capita"" is not just a stastical reference.

That being said, I'm also glad that Greece is getting out of this, in 2013 they have made a surplus when not counting debt service, and they will continue to do so if they keep their way. This way is harsh, it hurts to have a sudden lifestyle cut but in the end, maths is right: You will prosper if you don't dive into the red too much.

I know that may sound disapproving for the situation some Greeks are in, and I certainly don't like seeing people being evicted from their homes because of debts and losing their jobs, however, a sudden end is better than a long deflation period. 

Now I hope France will come to its senses, avoiding the demanding state regulation but freeze salaries until they're back head-to-head with their brothers on the other side of the Rhine. We have done it, and we're through (barely any new debts which will be eaten by inflation and countered by more tax income anyway, debt clearance from 2016), and I hope my government will continue to assist the European friends in trouble doing the same.

If not, check [this link](http://www.international.gc.ca/experience/destinations/france.aspx?lang=eng) and [that link](http://www.ambafrance-ca.org/France-Canada-youth-exchange), and apply as soon as applications open: these visas are in limited supply and usually on a first-come first-served basis if memory serves, and they are all gone within days.

There are probably other options, all that matters is that you're legally allowed to work, which is not necessarily a given.

Then I'd just Google [seasonal jobs in France](https://www.google.ca/search?q=seasonal+jobs+in+France&amp;oq=seasonal+jobs+in+France&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.6569j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) and check different possibilities. I'm pretty sure there are organisations that specialise in placing foreign seasonal workers, but I'd make serious research before using; while most are most likely fine, there is probably a number of dodgy ones.

Anything customer-facing will require some basic knowledge of French, and if all the French you've been exposed to is Grade 4-12 French, then you may have a problem, especially if you've been taught Canadian French, which  while technically the same language, is spoken in a widely different fashion. But as long as you try, people will usually be very nice and understanding. 

Bussing/wating tables is probably fine, as well as working on a farm or reception desk, carrying luggage etc. English tutoring may also be an option. Be aware that the food industry usually does require long hours (even more so bakery), so make it clear from the get go that what you are looking for is part-time.

Good luck.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; No, you really won't. 

It was a figure of speech. It's despicable that you base your whole argument attacking a claim I did not even make. I expected better from you. The only expectation I had starting this argument was that we should at least all agree that the position ""Greece is fully responsible for its own mess and is now reaping what it sow"" is wildly inaccurate, populist, scapgoatish drivel. 

&gt; The crisis began when Greece had to reveal that its primary deficit (i.e., not even counting interest payments on existing debt) was about 10% of GDP, and private investors demand for interest on new loans went through the roof as a result (new loans wouldn't have only been for those 10%, but old debt that would have to be rolled over as existing bonds reached their maturity date).

I'm not denying any of that. My position is that the debt problem is an epiphenomenon of deeper issues with the economic system and more specifically with the construction of the Eurozone. Was Greece in debt? Absolutely. Was that the moral failing that led to the crisis? No. It's like looking at mortgage debt in the US in 2007 and saying ""Wow, all these pitiful disgusting people took all these mortgages they could never pay off! The obvious solution to this debt crisis is that we should foreclosure all their houses and take everything they own! That will teach them to not pay back their debts!"". If this isn't a rational way to interpret the housing market crash, why is it a serious way to interpret the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone? 

&gt; This means that without the bailout packages, even if all of Greece's debt would have magically disappeared over night, the same kind of budget cuts would have been necessary.

Which proves what exactly? Countries are not households! You're treating this as if it was a household debt. Besides, there's a lot of ways to fix the deficit even if you assume public debt is like private debt. To presume that the highly ideological and destructive policies that the troika has been forcing Greece to apply are ""the only way"" and ""there is no alternative"" is so dishonest that I'm shocked to read someone who I thought was serious say it. 

&gt; As for ""predatory"", the interest rate Greece has to pay on those loans is equal to what the countries giving them have to pay in interest rates themselves

First of all, this wasn't true for the first years of the ""bailout"". Second, having a high interest rate is not the only way for a loan to be predatory. Third, I did not really claim that the bailout terms are predatory. 

&gt; And as MadManWithTinFoil already mentioned, part of the package was a ""debt restructuring"" worth about €100bn. That's quite a significant reduction by anyone's standards.

That's a bit of cherry picking isn't it? If you have an unsustainable debt of 100 euros and to avoid default I force you to take another 100 euros of debt, then me taking a ""restructuring"" and allowing you to default to part of the new 200 euro debt is not that big a relief. Greece's debt was unsustainable in 2011 and it took a lot of pain and extra debt just so German and French banks could better prepare for the hit. And you call that help. [Read this too.](http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/2013/11/11/dirty-secret-euro-zone-crisis-german-banks/)

&gt; most of Greece's debt had been held by Greek banks, after all.

Funny you should mention that. The portion of Greek debt held by Greek banks increased substantially between the time Greece should have defaulted and the time when the actual haircut took place. If anything, the whole bailout business managed to throw the harshest portion of the default internally to Greece rather than the foreign creditors that used to hold that debt. A hipster bail-in, sort to speak, before the much more direct Cyprus approach was invented.

&gt; But to blame the current state of the Greek economy on the bailout conditions disregards the effects the crisis would have had without the bailouts. It doesn't even come close. What you're seeing now, bad as it is, is the effect of the budget cuts implemented over several years instead of over night, and with the Greek banking sector still functional instead of wiped out.

That's just an unsubstantiated claim. For all we know, defaulting right away and exiting the Eurozone might have been better in the long term. You are again assuming that the fiscal adjustment that happened would have happened anyway on that same scale. That's not necessary for a country that has a national monetary policy. You are also assuming that the fiscal adjustment could not have happened in a more socially responsible way. That is also false.

&gt; As for the ""more money, grow out of it"" alternative, that's essentially what Greece had ever since it entered the Eurozone. Greece had easy access to loans, at the same rates as the other Eurozone countries (average spread for 10Y bonds up until 2008 compared to German ones was 0.27%). Yes, the Greek economy grew, but the debt grew even faster and the deficit along with it. Reforms would have been necessary either way, but I just can't imagine a Greek government implementing them without the threat of irregular default hanging over it and the Troika as a scape goat to blame them on. Keynesianism is fine and good when you have a decently functioning economy in temporary trouble, but that's just doesn't describe the situation in Greece. Hell, tourism is one of the few industries Greece has and taxes still don't get payed.

This is so stupid I can't even begin to describe my frustration. Are we back in 2010 or something? I thought it was common knowledge by now that YOU CAN'T HAVE A MONETARY UNION WITHOUT FUCKING FISCAL TRANSFERS. Germany beggared its neighbours by cheating and having an artificially lower inflation target than it should have. Greece squandered the easy credit it had access to at the same time. Both are despicable but the actual culprit here is the economic system which had perverse incentives for all actors inside of it. 

I am deeply disappointed to see someone I once respected fully endorse Germany's austerity rhetoric which makes no economic sense whatsoever. The whole ""everyone must have a surplus and pay their debts etc etc"" idiocy. I can't find the words to express how sad your comment has made me. Please take the time to educate yourself in economic matters beyond what the official German position is. Please. At the very least watch these two lectures:

You don't need to be a rocket scientist to realize that a reset is needed at somepoint. 

No, because this is not correct. To create money, collateral is left at the central bank. New central bank money is only created when new collateral has been created, which can be left at the central bank (e.g. mortgages on houses, stocks, bonds, …). The central bank lends out central bank money at a rate related to economic growth so that interest can be paid back by using the newly created wealth. Creation of deposit money in private banks is just a balance sheet extension.

[The Most Favored Nations for High-Tech Companies](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-23/the-most-favored-nations-for-high-tech-companies.html)

&gt;22.9% of US public companies are in the high tech industry


*(Companies in that industry specialize in aerospace and defense, biotechnology, hardware, software, Internet software and services, semiconductors, and renewable energy with a market value of over $1 million (~606,502 pounds) and have been public for over a year)*

[Why can't UK spawn high-tech companies that go public?](http://www.theweek.co.uk/prosper/55998/why-cant-uk-spawn-high-tech-companies-go-public#ixzz2oylRUtUY)

&gt;""An investment bank in the US will have 30 analysts specialising in particular aspects of the IT industry. In the UK, they might have one to cover everything from social media to Cobol tools.""

&gt;No wonder that, when the time does come to float, most Roundabout firms will probably choose New York over London.


[Technology on the Thames](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/technology/in-london-a-rising-silicon-upon-thames.html?_r=0)

&gt;Other cities in Europe, like Berlin, have budding tech scenes, but London has the benefit of its roots as a global financial center. In the last four years, the number of tech companies in East London has roughly quadrupled, to around 1,400, according to British government statistics. The city also attracts more venture capital than European rivals like Paris and Stockholm.

&gt;Still, London’s technology sector remains in its infancy compared with Silicon Valley. In the first half of the year, London’s start-ups raised $351 million, less than 10 percent of the investment directed to companies in California, according to Dow Jones Venture Source.

I'm not bashing UK at all (London's tech growth in the last four years has been astounding!) but I'm simply trying to point out the differences. It's hard to start up a tech company without proper funding, London attracts a ton of venture capital relative to most, but it is very small (1/10^th the size) compared to Silicon Valley, according to the article.

[Opinion Piece on why Europe lags the U.S. in technology startups](http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/17/guest-post-why-europe-lags-the-u-s-in-technology-startups/)

&gt;...While Europe has a larger overall population, it must cater to customers with different languages, media, cultures and currencies, all serving to add friction to innovation (particularly in terms of marketing). As a result, launching a product in the U.S. has a much greater chance of gaining traction and sufficient revenues to grow and prosper than is the case in Europe.

Related to what we're talking about, except for Canada:

[Tech brain drain: A Canadian problem?](http://sarahtee.com/tech-brain-drain-a-canadian-problem)

&gt;Like Albert, hundreds of Ontarians flock to San Francisco’s Bay Area yearly — joining 350,000 Canadians, who according to The Globe and Mail, reside and work within the region— eager to try their fortune in the world’s largest tech mecca.

&gt;But the huge influx of Canadian employees leaving this country has created a gaping hole in the industry, creating a worrying tech brain drain.

350,000 Canadians? That's greater than **1%** of the total Canadian population, just in the Bay Area in San Francisco. They're likely educated too if they're going to be working in tech. And very entrepreneurial if they're going to actually move countries to get into this industry.

[Why Canada is failing at tech](http://business.financialpost.com/2013/07/10/why-canada-is-failing-at-tech/?__lsa=e4a9-b1cc)

&gt;This summer, Facebook is cutting the ribbon on a brand new office in downtown Vancouver. The social media giant will employ some 150 staff, mainly recent software engineering grads from the area. According to the company, Vancouver was an ideal choice: close to Facebook offices in Seattle and Silicon Valley and attractive enough to pull in talented new recruits.

&gt;...Facebook’s new office has a one-year lifespan. It’s a pop-up boot camp for training local software engineers and then shipping them to the U.S. In fact, one year happens to be roughly the time required for a Canadian engineer to secure a permit for full-time work in the states...

&gt;Rather than contributing to a homegrown tech scene, in other words, the new office will siphon off the already limited number of qualified professionals in the region. It’s less a success story than a reminder of a chronic problem.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; Germany could have done the same, but he did our reforms when the world economy wasn't struggling. It appears that it was the smart thing to do, something one cannot say about Greece. Greece needed similar reforms and could have done so when they had access to cheap money, instead of having a big ""party"" and wasting all the money. Those reforms would still be painful but not as close as it is right now. It is your fault to wait that long to do the reforms. 

Are you back to the whole ""We Germans did our reforms when we had to and now you should do them too"" rhetoric? I know that's the official German position but please try to critically think about if that makes sense. Germany played a beggar thy neighbour game, sapping demand from everyone else and throwing the whole system out of balance. [Please watch this short lecture to understand what the hell I'm talking about.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=iPFH-yXm9VY)

It's painful for me to watch you uncritically adopt the paternalistic view of the infallible ""reforms"" that can only do you good and whoever is not implementing them should be punished. Germany took advantage of the system and it will soon come crashing down on them too. 

&gt; Countries refinance itself by taxing their population. If you avoid paying your taxes and still want a social safety net, your country need to take loans to do so. If the citizens of Greece decided to pay what they should and not to dodge taxes, the government wouldn't have needed to take as many loans to keep their country running. 

You know full well that the economic crisis touched countries where tax evasion wasn't a problem. I would say ""correlation does not imply causation"" but in this case the correlation isn't actually strong at all. In geenral, the whole rhetoric of ""Greece wasting their money in a party while everyone else was working hard"" is so extremely dishonest that I will not even reply to it. I leave it to you to take the initiative to think critically and search on your own whether it was true or not. 

&gt; No I don't know that almost all countries did the same, in fact I am convinced that Greece was the only country who did so.

Oh, you're convinced aren't you? What an honest position! You're convinced of something because doubting it would shake your biased and ludicrous opinions. What about [Italy or France](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=SuU32WLMjl8#t=1618) or even [Germany](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=SuU32WLMjl8#t=1641)

&gt; Also what has Germany unemployment numbers to do with it? 

So, when Germany misreports on the health of its economy it doesn't affect its neighbours? But when Greece misreports some other aspect of the health of its economy suddenly it directly affects its neighbours? That's a double standard you've got there. [Not to mention Germany's manipulation of the rules in order to allow for some stimulus money for its economy when it needed it.](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-ticking-euro-bomb-how-the-euro-zone-ignored-its-own-rules-a-790333.html)

&gt; The numbers are lower because the German government have a definition about employment, most people disagree with, but they are not betraying their European partners with it. 

It goes far beyond that and it's much more manipulative and corrupt than a ""contentious definition"". [Look at what German people have to say about the matter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1tq9k9/question_for_europeans_have_any_of_your_countries/ceagc6j)

&gt; But that is what you demand! Greece wants a bigger debt reduction, which means that poorer countries will have to pay for it too. 

I don't want a debt reduction for Greece. I want a fiscal union or some other similar stabilising mechanism for the Eurozone. Such a mechanism would help the poor countries all over Europe, not just Greece. Back in 1974 the European Commission asked a bunch of economists what it would take to create a monetary union. [The answer was that it would take fiscal transfers to the tune of 10% GNP.](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=26537)

&gt; And your are kidding if you say that the hit the Creditors had to take is laughable, or? They were forced to write off 107 billions! 53% of their investment! I assume only a 100% write off plus paying for your living standard is the only way to be not laughable? 

The haircut was only applied to the private sector. I was talking about the official sector. Besides, by the time the haircut took place most of the Greek debt that was in private hands had moved back internally to Greece. It was mostly Greek institutions that suddenly had to live with 53% less money. Finally, let's not forget that a large portion of the debt that was restructured was just the craziness of the first bailout: Greece was already bankrupted in 2011 and at the time it was forced to take a gigantic loan of 110 billion euros that it could never really repay. If you owe me 100 euros and when you can't pay I tell you ""no, no, I can't accept you not paying, take 100 euros more as a loan right now"" then it's not really a relief for you if after a couple of years I forgive part of that debt.

I have a hard time finding French comedians who talk about sensitive stuff. He's probably the only known one who does. Otherwise I have to turn to anglo saxon comedians to get comedy which isn't about sending SMS and boring stuff like that.

true,Tollaneer,POLA,can into space,"I believe he stated that there are no plans for him being PM for third term. And bringing out someone new probably would be a good idea - in polls about trusting public figures he always has one of the lowest scores amongst all major politicians. Watching the scene - I think that if he doesn't turn around, [Ewa Kopacz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewa_Kopacz) is going for the position. She's deputy and Marshall of the Sejm and recently replaced Grzegorz Schetyna as vice-chairman of Civic Platform.

As to if the Civic Platform will win at all - yes. After how many failed governments? I don't know. You see - issue here is that voters are split 1/3-1/3. CP and LaJ both get around 30% of votes, socialist Democratic Left Alliance has ~15%, greens allied with CP have 3-4% (remember that we have 4% threshold), CP conservatives have 5-3% (new party, too early to say for sure) and around 20% doesn't know what to choose.       
This last group is a problem - I don't know who will sway them. CP may get them by scaring people of LaJ conservative and paranoid rule. LaJ may lead a successful campaign of ""we're the only alternative"". Issue here is that most of the voters want neither. Even ones that declare that they'll vote on one or the another. It's often ""I don't want LaJ to win"" or ""everything but another term of Civic Platform"".

Another issue - Law and Justice may win, but they'll never go above 35-40% of vote. And there's nobody to give them these seats - there's no player on board that will go into coalition with LaJ. That means if they win, LaJ government fails after few months of not being able to do anything, and we get another election. On the other hand - Civic Platform, after kicking out conservative faction, may ally with socialists and greens. So currently worst case scenario for Poland is ""Belgium"".

Oh. One more thing - this may not even happen, because before parliament elections we have presidential elections that CP candidate Bronisław Komorowski (current President) will win for sure - he has like 70% approval rate. That will be a massive blow to the LaJ line of ""nobody wants these guys"", that might even push them behind Civic Platform.
       
So yeah. Overall - Civic Platform probably stays, but I don't know if they'll do it in first election. If they do - ruling coalition will have to include socialists. Donald Tusk probably won't be the PM. Bronisław Komorowski will stay as the President.

Even in simple practical terms. With growth in China slowing, other developing economies slowing as well (Brazil, India etc), Europe still not growing at any decent rate and the USA only just turning the corner, any major instability in the market will cause all of that to come crashing down. 

High Oil prices sound good for them but in reality they realise it is not because it will lead to future sales being lower as well as something called [demand destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_destruction). It will facilitate a concerted push to move away from oil which is unhelpful to the Saudi's to say the least. They dont want any of this and are already important stakeholders in the global economy. Sudden upheavals in the market will also negatively affect the country internally and may cause issues for the royal family legitimacy. Doing that would be the ""nuclear"" option and its not something they would seriously consider over Syria (Maybe Iran if it really is seen as worth it).
