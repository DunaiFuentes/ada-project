true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;They didn't the same as the Taliban didn't to Al-Qaeda up until the invasion of Afghanistan

Then why did you say this:

&gt;Americans funded the IRA as well as training them and supplying them with weapons.

Moving on, according to the [wiki entry for Al Qaeda, which has some citations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda#Refuge_in_Afghanistan) (and numerous other studies on them), their main HQ was in Afghanistan and had been since 1996. One of those citations discusses the shared militancy between the two organisations. Thus, they were two separate bodies with some strong overlap between them (i.e. shared militancy).

The argument for training is actually not so much that the Taliban trained Al Qaeda, but that Al Qaeda trained a unit of the Taliban, [Brigade 055.](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,181591,00.html) More on that can be found in this [Guardian article,](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/27/afghanistan.terrorism6) but to provide a couple of choice quotes:

&gt;It has been based and trained at Rishikor, a former Afghan army base outside Kabul.

That clearly implies the Taliban giving legitimacy to Al Qaeda. And:

&gt;It is that part of al-Qaida that appears to be exclusively dedicated to the support of the Taliban

Those articles were written in 2001, so perhaps there's argument for them being politically motivated etc. (its perhaps understandable that our journalists made these connections in 2001, even if you assert, as you are, that there was no real link between the Taliban and Al Qaeda). However, documents found after Bin Laden's killing in 2012 have since made indisputable links between the heads of both organisations (Bin Laden and Omar in this case).

true,JarasM,POLA,Poland,"These are just declinations, so yes, they all mean two, but they change based on what are you actually counting. Basically:

1. Dwa - two masculine objects, like ""Dwa piwa"" = ""Twe beers""

1. Dwie - two feminine objects, ""Dwie lampy"" = ""Two lamps""

1. Dwoje - two neuter objects, ""Dwoje dzieci"" = ""Two children"". Also used to address a group of people of mixed gender

1. Dwóch - two men

1. Dwaj - kinda similar to the above, two men, but used in a bit different context

etc.

It may seem complicated (and it probably is a bit), but it allows to communicate a lot in one or two simple words. By just declining the word ""two"" I can say if those are two objects, people, their gender, as well as make the word possessive or whatnot. You could ask ""Whose keys are these?"" and I could answer with ""Tych dwojga"" meaning ""Those two people of which one is male and the other is female"".

This however makes some translations hard from English - English language doesn't generally carry information about the gender, which can create ambiguity in a story, where the author doesn't reveal who's the protagonist in a scene. Polish does carry such information - you just can't say much in Polish about a person without revealing their gender. So either the translation must assume a gender (if it's not a huge problem), or use awkwardly vague statements like only calling someone a ""person"".

true,ajuc,POLA,Poland,"Nouns also change with the numbers in a weird way:

 - 1 apple = 1 jabłko 
 - 2-4 apples = 2-4 jabłka
 - 5-21 apples = 5-21 jabłek
 - 22-24 apples = 22-24 jabłka
 - 25-31 apples = 25-31 jabłek
etc.

And it applies to every noun there is, but the endings may be different. The correct noun ending depends on the last 2 digits of the quantity of the thing. That's why almost no software written outside Poland deals correctly with showing messages like ""you got N new messages"". They always use wrong ending for some numbers :)

Also Old Polish had 3 types of plurality:

 - singular (1 object)
 - dual (2 objects) 
 - plural (more than 2 objects)

Most languages have only singular and plural. In modern Polish the dual kind disappeared, but not completely - in some proverbs and archaic words it still exist.

Another thing - you use other version of noun to say you have object, and different to say you don't have that object. I have an apple = ""Mam jabłko"". I don't have an apple = ""Nie mam jabłka"". Of course the words depends on the number of things also. So:

I have 2 apples = ""Mam dwa jabłka"".

I don't have 2 apples = ""Nie mam dwóch jabłek"".

Notice the different endings in both the number and the noun.

I have 5 apples = ""Mam pięć jabłek"".

I don't have 5 apples = ""Nie mam pięciu jabłek"".


And so on, for every word you need to know all the versions to speak correctly (you will be understood without knowing that, of course, most of the time at least).


Also we have 7 grammatical cases (German has 4 AFAIR). We have separate version of every noun for calling to get its attention, for example, also separate version for when we lack this particular thing. Example:

It's Magdalena = ""To Magdalena"" (the basic case)

I lack Magdalena = ""Brakuje mi Magdaleny"" (lacking sth, missing sth, not having sth)

I like Magdalena = ""Lubię Magdalenę"" (speaking about one-way relations, in which the other object/subject is inactive, hard to describe)

I give flowers to Magdalena = ""Daję kwiaty Magdalenie"" (""target case"", for when the object/subject is target of some action)

I used Magdalena = ""Wykorzystałem Magdalenę"" (""tool case"" - for using sth/sbd)

I stand near Magdalena = ""Stoję przy Magdalenie"" (""place case"" - for speaking about places and spatial relations)

Magdalena, come here! = ""Magdaleno, przyjdź tutaj!"" (calling to get sth/sbd attention)


Every noun is changed in every phrase depending on the role it plays in it (some words have a few cases that are the same, but for most words every case is different).

Bonus point - nowhere in these phrases I used the word for ""I"" in Polish (""ja""). It's almost always omitted, because verbs conjugate depending on who performs the action.",0,1364085278,null,0,1364129351,0,c918fmt,t3_1avedj,t1_c918fmt,t1_c9182x0,null,1431682434,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

Tell me if I'm getting the gist of it correctly. There are several different cultural attitudes towards money and responsibility in Europe. Germany has been highly responsible and diligent in their approach, while southern European countries have been rather lax and irresponsible. Germans know they're being responsible, while southern Europeans feel entitled to sponge off of them because Hitler, and whatever. Is this even close?

Given what appears to be extreme cultural differences in financial affairs, and responsibility in general, how can anyone expect the Euro to survive?

I speak biscayan dialect but I also learnt euskera batua (the unified basque dialect) at school and I only know how to write grammaticaly correctly in it. The thing is we didn't have a unified language or written system until the '70s so the dialects evolved separatedly and wildly for centuries. So what I say and write are very different.

For such a small language in such a small space we have a huge difference in dialects.

The language has pretty weird things for a none native maybe one of the most challenging ones is the verb and it's cases. Most languages have acusative, dative, nominative... Well in basque I guess it's close to infinite.The verb holds information about the tense, the subject, the direct object, the indirect object... It's ergative-absolutive.
And well about the history no fucking idea it's part of it's charm!

As a comparision: 
Germans like their bread and usually get their bread at a bakery. Usually they are the place where you quickly get your morning coffee in smaller towns. (I haven't seen (m)any starbucks in 50k cities yet)

Anyway, often the bakery shops are located in entrance areas of supermarkets where ppl approach from 2 sides, the register area and the main entrance. So ppl just end up standing there and the lady behind the desk will ask ""Who's next?"" and ppl usually know that they arrived after another guy etc. and the queue will be realized that way. Also McDonals McCafé etc. more or less works the same. It's that free open space in front of the counter that might confuse us germans. ""Walk in front of the counter, check out what to get, then approach the counter""-like. Idk.

So my guess is ppl are just assuming that kind of explaination that should not really happen when a clear queue is visible while the guys prepare in their mind ""Won Kofi Pliehs!""

Probably the same ppl that ask where to find milk and sugar, mayb you should track the correlation.

Generally i wouldn't say we wouldn't obey queues, i'm usually the only guy to ask the clerks to open up another register when i arrive at a long queue at the supermarket. As a side node, when you just got a couple things at the supermarket people are usually extremly friendly so you can have their spot because they have to unload their shoppoing kart first.

There are also some words in Finland-Swedish that would be considered slightly archaic in Sweden.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've worked in different British universities for my whole career. Currently I'm in the central IT department of a university and surrounded by British people, but I began working as a technician in various research labs in Electronic Engineering departments. I was surrounded then by people from all over the world. 

Iraqis were pretty common when I began my career, as were Jordanians and Pakistanis. A curious thing I noticed early on, and this was around '92 when I was 20 or so, was that in social gatherings and just chatting about things in general people used their own languages. When discussing their work with each other they spoke English. It wasn't just a lingua franca, and they weren't just doing it to include native English speakers like me in their conversations. English was the preferred language for their conversations about technology, particularly things relating to computers and programming. 

I have noticed this phenomenon many times. Where I work now has a lot of Spanish undergrads and from overhearing their conversations when having lunch or a coffee at work they seem to do it too. I have a very geeky Polish friend and he reports the same thing not just here but in Poland too. 

I've often wondered what it's like for a non-native English speaker to learn to program in a modern programming language. Programming languages are often a hybrid of mathematical concepts and English. As someone who is largely self taught (as I suppose most programmers must be, beyond a certain point) I have been helped tremendously by this. Concepts that you don't come across in every day life are explained by the keywords used in the programming language that describe them. 

My Polish friend says that, as he does now, he always used the English documentation when he was learning. It was probably written in English in the first place, and it describes concepts that need to be accurately described because they do a very specific thing. Translations into other languages can be good but maybe lose a little something in the translation, and in any case it will be a description of a language which itself owes much to English. 

I guess we don't realise how lucky we are sometimes. Between ourselves and the Americans (and honestly, because of this aspect, and of course mass media, I would put much of it down to the Americans rather than us) English is *the* important language. It's not the most common, but I think it is the most important because of the combination of reasons from which it derives its importance. 

FWIW, we have lots of Chinese undergraduates at the moment too. I rarely hear them speaking English to each other. To others yes, but very rarely amongst themselves. I do not know how much of a factor this phenomenon is in China and other eastern countries.

&gt;German objections forced Brussels to shelve an ambitious blueprint for a single guarantee scheme to cover all €5tn in eurozone bank deposits that was to be unveiled on Wednesday, laying bare the political obstacles facing a full banking union.

&gt;The European Commission had planned to publish the detailed road map to the fund, which would have also been used to pay for failed banks to be wound down, alongside proposals it did unveil on a single eurozone bank supervisor, according to drafts obtained by the Financial Times.

&gt;But the three-page section, which christened two new agencies, set a timetable for a legislative proposal and outlined a new levy on eurozone banks, was deleted at the 11th hour after Berlin complained it was premature and unrealistic, according to officials involved in the discussions.

&gt;EU officials have agreed a eurozone banking union – where oversight, regulation and control over financial institutions now in the hands of member states is shifted to Brussels – is essential to reverse the crisis that has weakened both Europe’s financial system and sovereign debt levels.

&gt;But the episode underlines the deep-seated resistance to some of its most critical elements in Berlin, where the eurozone-wide deposit guarantee scheme – which would essentially lead German taxpayers to underwrite Spanish depositors – is politically explosive.
...

&gt;In earlier drafts seen by the FT, the commission next year was to propose a new agency, the European Deposit Insurance and Resolution Authority (Edira), which would control a new European Deposit 
Guarantee and Resolution Fund (Edgar).

&gt;In what would mark a dramatic transfer of sovereignty, Edira would be given pan-eurozone responsibility for deciding when to call time on a struggling bank or impose losses on its bondholders. “Edira would become the single resolution authority for the banking union,” the draft says.

&gt;Edira, which would be financed through a regular levy on eurozone banks, would give the agency the financial clout to deal with bank failures quickly and decisively, paying for the transitional costs of winding up banks. Edira, which would potentially have the backing of the eurozone’s existing €500bn rescue fund, would also replace national deposit guarantee arrangements.

Irish doesn't have specific words for yes or no, instead you repeat the verb. ""Do you have any apples?"" would be respondend to with, ""I have"". This has bled over into English for Irish people and is a feature of [Hiberno English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-English)

1. The only figure in the present government that has some credible emotional attachment to the European idea is - somewhat paradoxically - our minister of finance, Schäuble. 

2. The minor party in the government has a strong anti-euro fraction within its ranks. For some time, it was probable that they may be voted out of parliament in the coming election. I'm not sure anymore that this will happen. What a pity...

3. A lot of commentators in the German media have pointed out for years that Merkel may be a brillant manager of political day-to-day business. But she doesn't have any convictions she wouldn't be ready to sell, if it keeps her in office.

4. At the same time, her calculations are fairly rational (she's a physics Ph. D. after all). She fully understands that Germany would be doomed, if the Euro was to fail. 

5. Placating what she views as 'failing' states does not earn her votes. A failing Euro won't earn her votes (because our economy will crash instantly). 

6. She probably regrets that Germany had had sentimental Helmut Kohl instead of Maggie Thatcher. She would love to fight with her purse shut, but, alas, this would sink her more quickly than doling out help while making it difficult.

In sum: She probably is the worst chancellor Germany could have had in this crisis (my 2c).

It's now also looking likely that the 'russian oligarghs' are only going to get a small levy on their deposits under this alleged agreement as the russian banks appear to be fine. The banks with the problems are Laiki (really fucked) and Bank of Cyprus (wasn't too fucked but definitely will be after what has happened).

The last week or so has now caused a 'psychological problem' where people will now value the currency in their hand rather than stored on a computer somewhere.

Being the Republic of Italy a young country ( formerly Reign of Italy, from 1861 to 1946 ) regional differences in Italian are quite strong since people in different States before unification used their own variant. Modern Italian is actually a 'revived' language: due to abundance of high quality reference literature ( Dante and Boccaccio among others ) XIII century Florentine was chosen as Standard Italian by Piedmontese kings who actually often had some trouble with it and kept using their own variant more similar to French.

Italian seems to be a musical language, with high variety in tone and depth and mastering Spanish would allow you to communicate with an Italian with a minimum loss of information, thanks to the huge similarities in both grammar and vocabulary.

Germans and Greeks are not genetically predisposed to hate each other. Before the crisis, sporadic critical remarks here and there *never* managed to lead to a groundswell of anti-Greek or anti-German sentiment. As a matter of fact, it was German media that praised the cooperation of Germans and Greeks as Euro 2004 winners. However insignificant this might seem, as it is, after all, related to 22 guys chasing a ball and two other guys shouting at them, the Greeks started to hold Germans in managerial positions in high regard. Germans giving orders to people notorious for their free spirit attitude, with many of them being victims of the other side's attrocities, was a good thing. The past was exactly that: the past. It was time for Germans to be more laid-back and Greeks to be more systematic. All was well.

But then, in Autumn 2009, the Greek deficit figures were revised. And revised again. And again. Then Bild, a populist German newspaper, started building a narrative. A complex issue was broken down to a myth of ants and cicadas. More serious publications jumped to the bandwagon. Stories moved from the inside pages to more prominent positions. 

We're now five months into Papandreou's administration and Focus does the unthinkable. In media terms, this was a cataclysmic event. One might argue that Aphrodite isn't even real, and that satire shouldn't have any boundaries, despite its tastelessness. But what matters is how the side affected perceives it. Sensitivities do not follow a specific recipe. As using the swastika is a bad thing for the Germans, insulting anything related to ancient Greece is a bad thing for Greeks.

Greek media felt inclined to answer. And boy, did they answer. German media and politicians kept at it. [Now, Greece had to sell Corfu, or even the Acropolis.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/mar/04/greece-sell-islands-german-mps) All hell broke loose.

""*Kämmen*"" (hand) has ""*kynnet*"" (fingernails), so ""*kahden kämmenen kynnet*"" will be ""(the) two hands fingernails"".

Sorry, but not even 1% of what you're saying is true. It is very unfortunate that the same myths are repeated here, despite being debunked again and again.

Private investors with older Greek bonds were asked to exchange them with new ones. Many of them have bought these older Greek bonds at a fraction of their face value. Simply put, they exchanged a paper saying ""in a few years Greece will give you €105, because you gave Greece €100"", a paper which they've bought for €25, with another one saying ""take back €20 of the €25 you've paid for this, and we'll give you €10 more in a few years, forget about the €105"". **Other countries were not involved in this procedure, it was only about PRIVATE investors. This deal only took care of a PART of the debt.**

As for the paying back part, it seems that you're not aware that other EU countries make a profit out of the **loans**. Finance ministers made it very clear. Greece is **already** making scheduled payments to other countries.

Even the revised deals are profitable for creditors. As an example, read this.

true,StoneCall,SACH,Leipzig,"&gt; Steuern sind in erster Linie Einkommensarten für den Staat, nicht Strafmaßnahmen für Leute, deren Schröpfung sozial anerkannt ist und einfache Wählerstimmen verspricht.

Es geht hier einfach um eine Besteuerung nach Leistungsfähigkeit, und 250 von 1.000 Euro ist ein größerer Einschnitt als 2.500 von 10.000 Euro.

&gt; Und das ist auch richtig so. Wieso sollte der Staat ausgerechnet bei Mietwohnungen nicht zugreifen, in einem Land, das ganz überwiegend aus Mietern besteht? Wieso sollte ein Brötchen nicht voll besteuert werden? 

Denkst du, nach Einführung der Steuer würden die Einkommen aus dem Nichts plötzlich um genau den Betrag, der für den Ausgleich nötig ist, steigen?

Klar kann man eine Sozialleistung einführen, die die Differenz ausgleicht - aber das wäre dann nur das Schieben von Geld von der linken in die rechte Tasche.

Der Grund, warum die Wohnraummiete von der Mehrwertssteuer ausgenommen ist, ist sozialer Natur. Wer weniger als 1.300 Euro im Monat verdient (also nach Definition des Statistischen Bundesamtes Geringverdiener ist) gibt derzeit etwa die Hälfte seines Einkommens für die Miete aus. Mit der Steuer wären es knapp unter 60%. Der Durchschnittsdeutsche gibt nur ein Drittel aus, mit Steuer wären es etwa 40%.

&gt; Davon abgesehen: Gerade im Lebensmittelbereich ist Deutschland eines der billigsten Länder überhaupt. Der Preiskampf wird auch hier weitergehen, und die Auswirkungen auf den Durchschnittshaushalt werden minimal sein.

Der Preiskampf führt dazu, dass die Preise bereits jetzt so niedrig sind wie nur möglich, mit geringen bis negativen Margen bei einzelnen Produkten. Wird die Steuer erhöht, müssen die Preise also steigen, anders würde die Kalkulation der Kaufhallen nicht mehr aufgehen.

&gt; Wie Norderfriedrichskoog vorgemacht hat, geschieht das bereits jetzt mit dem alten Steuersystem. 

Richtig. Deswegen ist eine Besteuerung nach Gemeinden Quatsch.

&gt; Was spricht dafür? Gesamteinkommen * 0,25 = Steuerschuld ... das ist einfach. Mit Progression geht's schon wieder los... 

""Extrem einfach"" ist nun einmal auch sozial massiv ungerecht, und mir ist es wichtiger, dass das Steuersystem (halbwegs) sozial gerecht ist, auch wenn es bedeutet, dass man zur Berechnung der Steuerschuld einen Taschenrechner zur Hand nehmen muss.",0,1364126147,null,0,false,0,c91g13g,t3_1avyhk,t1_c91g13g,t1_c91fxfs,null,1431686085,5,false,de,t5_22i0,5

Tatsächlich sieht der Kirchhof-Entwurf einen jährlichen Freibetrag von 10000 Euro für Alleinstehende und 40000 für Familien mit Kindern vor. Der Geringverdiener mit 1000 monatlich zahlt also im Jahr nur ((12 x 1000€)-10000€) x 0,25 = 50€.

Nebenbei sind diese Freibeträge deutlich höher als bisher. Der selbe Geringverdiener, keine Kinder, Single zahlt bei 12000 €/Jahr heute 118€/Jahr Steuern.

Ja, auch ich habe den Artikel gelesen. Meine Aussage war: Ein fixer Prozentsatz ist keine faire Steuer, weil - sagen wir - 25% von 1.000 Euro den Unterschied zwischen Taubenverschlag und ordentlicher Wohnung ausmachen, aber 25% von 10.000 Euro den Unterschied zwischen Ferrari und Lamborghini.

Yoga pants are fashionable but you won't find my scrawny ass in them. The countries thay loaded up debt already had funds. They weren't spending money meant to help them improve their most basic services and systems and get them up to everyone else's levels.

Blame is on Greece and only Greece: they finagled the numbers to get into the euro to begin with, they'd already started cutting Ponzi scheme deals with Goldman Sachs before the first €1 coin with an owl on one side was released, they continue to refuse to pay taxes, corruption is rife, nothing gets done without graft, retirement age is a nonsensical under-60, and I that's before you get to the insane fiscal waste which is the small bit that ""austerity measures"" could help, from multi billion-euro warships to waggle their little dicks at Turkey to unneeded infrastructure to insane social welfare grants that not even the Middle East throws out there to keep the masses less unhappy, like, post-graduate school tuition, costs, housing, food, allowance, *and vacation*, and not even limited to domestic schools.

Instead, blame the Americans and Bush, the people we called idiots but whose stupidity Greece was somehow coerced into following because, well, other Western countries were doing it.

It is spoken mostly in Albania, Kosova, and Macedonia although dialectical differences can make communication a little difficult at times when traveling between those areas. The two main dialects are Tosk and Gegh. Tosk is a generally seen as standard Albanian and has its orgins in the central and southern regions of Albania. Gegh is mostly spoken in the northern areas of Albania and in Kosova.

Das System Kirchhof hat seine Vorteile. Simpel ist gut, aber nicht gerecht. 


Meine groessten Kritikpunkte sind: 

* Unternehmen und Personen sind gleichbehandelt. Das ist Bullshit.

* Keine Progression. Spitzensteuersatz wie unter Kohl bei 48%, Freibetrag 10k Euro pro Kopf, die alle 5 Jahre oder so inflationsbereinigt werden sollten, dann linear progressiv.

* Mehrwertsteuer sollte bei 19%/7% bleiben, die Kategorien kann man aber mal etwas aufraeumen (s. Suesskartoffel vs. Kartoffel)

* Erbschaftsteuer ist sinnvoll. Beibehalten/erhoehen. Nur weil Mami und Papi die Millionen hamstern, finde ich nicht, dass die Kinder ein Recht auf deren riesen Vermoegen haben. Wir sind kein Feudalstaat, jeder sollte sich seinen Platz in der Gesellschaft erarbeiten. Ist das nicht auch die Ansicht der Liberalen?

Warum sind denn Leute in unserem Land Besserverdiener? 

Weil sie seit dem Kindergarten an der Titte Germanias hangen und Bildung aufgesogen haben bis zum Abi. Fucking kostenlos.

Dann ab in die Uni, in den Rankings sind wir ja nie bei den grossen US/UK-Unis. Das taeuscht. Unsere durchschnittliche Uni-Ausbildung ist absolut weltklasse.

Natuerlich sind das subjektive Eindruecke, aber viele andere bestaetigen mir das unabhaengig von mir. Klar, es gibt auch dort sehr gut Studenten/Ueberflieger und die Forschung ist dort auch top. I digress.

Und kultiviert sind sie ja auch, die Besserverdiener, weil sie in der Buecherei (Subventioniert) gestoebert oder im Theater (subventioniert dass es kracht) sich durch die Raeuber gequaelt haben. 

Naja, waere ja nochmal schoener, wenn man den Herrschaften nach dem wohlverdienten Geld trachten wuerde. Das haben sie sich selbst durch harte harte Arbeit verdient.

Nach dem Theater dann mit dem Mercedes mit 220 ueber die A8 brettern? Klar, darf man ja, man hat sich das Auto verdient. Wer hat nochmal die A8 gebaut? ACH JA, der FUCKING STAAT.

Ich persoenlich bin Student kurz vor dem Masterabschluss, Kleinunternehmer (IT-Support) und habe noch 2 Nebenjobs. Krieg kein Bafoeg weil meine Eltern ein Haus haben. 

Aber ich haette trotzdem nichts von dem, was ich jetzt habe, oder bald haben werde nach dem Abschluss, ohne den deutschen Staat. 

Wenn ich in 10 Jahren 250k verdienen sollte, gebe ich dem Staat gerne 50% davon, damit die naechsten die selben Chancen kriegen koennen. Alles andere ist asozial.",0,1364134966,null,0,1364135175,0,c91h8m0,t3_1avyhk,t1_c91h8m0,t1_c918kk4,null,1431686655,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2

Die CDU ist für mich grundsätzlich unwählbar, weil sie die wirtschaftlichen Prinzipien der FDP, also möglichst große Freiheiten für Unternehmen, mit einem Obrigkeitsstaat in Sachen Bürgerrechten kombiniert - siehe Bundesinnenministerium. 

Die FDP ist für mich unwählbar, weil sie wirtschaftspolitisch keinerlei Lehren aus den Krisen der vergangenen Jahre gezogen hat und sich ansonsten als zumindest nahezu korrupt (Hotelsteuer) und in Sachen Bürgerrechten als kaum standfest gezeigt hat. Frau Leutheuser-Schnarrenberger ist da eine leuchtende Ausnahme, die in ihrer eigenen Partei auf verlorenem Posten steht.

In der SPD war ich selbst lange Jahre Mitglied, aber spätestens mit dem Leistungsschutzrecht hat sie bei mir massiv verkackt.

Die Grünen kann ich nicht wählen, weil sie mir zugunsten eines als ""gut"" angesehenen Lebensmodells zu tief in mein eigenes Leben eingreift. Ich will mir das Recht auf eigene Fehler bewahren.

Die Linke ist eine famose Oppositionspartei, außerdem bin ich einem ihrer MdB familiär verbunden, aber wählen kann ich sie auch nicht weil sie erstens weit an der Realität vorbei agiert und in Regierungsverantwortung komplett versagen würde und ich zweitens keine Partei wählen kann deren Duisburger Ortsverband ich vor zwei Jahren wegen Volksverhetzung angezeigt habe.

Die Piraten haben es geschafft innerhalb eines guten Jahres meine Politikverdrossenheit zu maximieren - Ich glaube weiterhin dass es dort gute Köpfe gibt, aber die hört man fast nie. Stattdessen schreiben einige Exponenten Bücher die sich wie Deutsch LK-Besinnungsaufsätze lesen, andere verschwenden mit krudem Metahumor Steuergelder für Zombie-Anfragen, und der größte Teil ist mit sich selbst beschäftigt. Zudem finden sich in manchen, durchaus größeren Ortsverbänden, merkwürdige Berührungspunkte mit rechtspopulistischen Bewegungen und Menschen wie Otla Pinnow, die die Grenze zum Rassismus nicht nur einmal öffentlich überschritten haben.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Its the reality of the economic theory behind why a minimum wage is bad (I'm not saying this theory is good, just that it is demonstrated). For the sake of debate I will follow this up:

Germany has little unemployment, but many of the workers at the very low end are highly unskilled. Germany also has more foreign workers that any other EU nation. 

* In many cases unless foreigners speak good German they are unlikely to find a well paying job. Having a minimum wage would make it impossible for these people to get jobs, because a minimum wage would also raise the standard expected by the employer (i.e. you'd pay someone €2 per hour if they don't speak German, you wouldn't pay them €8 - I made up the numbers because I don't know German wages, but it still makes sense).

* Having a very low paid job is also better than no job at all for the worker because they also receive training and acquire experience. This makes them significantly more employable than non-workers, and continually increases their skills (leading to promotions and wage rises).

* Upping the minimum wage increases firm labour costs. Quite simply, you can employ 100 on €1 an hour, but only 50 people on €2 an hour. Thus no minimum wage means employment will rise.

* Unemployed people need unemployment benefit. Thus its better for the government to have no minimum wage. Even if the people work 'minijobs' that are topped-up with unemployment benefit, this is still cheaper for the government. Plus these people make the company they work for more efficient and profitable. Therefore it also ultimately increases corporate tax revenue for the German government.

I don't support this argument. I'd rather there was a minimum wage. But there's the theory behind this chart (and German government policy).

The public cried, went on strike, voted out Chancellor Schröder (the ""face"" of said reforms) and finally accepted a lowered standard of living in hopes of future benefits. Reforms were a success. German unemployment rate dropped. Thanks to this, Germany now has the economic strength to bail out its EU buddies for as long as they need to make some reforms in their own backyard. And thanks to this the Germans are still waiting to gain some of those long-term benefits they tried to achieve.

true,addicted_to_coffee,GERM,Germany,"&gt; It has agglutination like German, so you can make really long words. One of the famous ones is çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınız, which means, ""you appear to be one of those whom we were unable to turn into a Czechoslovakian.""

That’s not the same as in German, though. In German you can stick together nouns to form combined nouns. For example:

* German: Taxifahrer (Taxi + Fahrer)
* Turkish: taksi şoförü 
* English: taxi driver

Another one:

* German: Kaffeemaschine (Kaffee + Maschine)
* Turkish: kahve makinesi
* English: coffee machine

In Turkish these ridiculously long words carry massive amounts of information. This makes understanding Turkish quite hard for me (especially when spoken), while speaking or writing it myself is not too hard, as once you get the basic concepts somehow everything tends to be pretty straightforward. For example:

* German: mein Haus
* Turkish: evim
* English: my house

To make it more clear:

* German: Ich gehe nicht zu meinem Haus.
* Turkish: Evime gitmiyorum.
* English: I do not go to my house. ",0,1364140068,null,0,false,0,c91ibw5,t3_1avedj,t1_c91ibw5,t1_c9153x8,null,1431687169,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"A mixture of personal belief and economic arguments that a minimum wage is a good thing.

* If I was arguing against myself I would look into whether the lack of a minimum wage has led Germany to have a disproportionate number of foreign workers. This makes perfect sense if we assumed Germany to be using the EU solely for its own gain (obviously all the migrants go there thus helping the German economy, whilst the rest of Europe with its minimum wages get crippled on labour costs and consequent productivity decline). I'm sure people on here feel that way as it is.

* Secondly it prevents worker abuse. Without a minimum wage competition could lead private sector wages to decrease to an absolute minimum. The converse could be argued of course, that one employer offers a slightly higher wage and duly hires all the most productive staff. That's great for business, but I believe its a failure of society if that is the case.

* Thirdly, it can be argued that no minimum wage leads to even greater disparity between workers (remember all that 99%/1% stuff last year - no minimum wage increases this). Thus minimum wages increase the quality of life for workers at the bottom (bad for business, but a good objective for any government).

There's a bunch of other reasons. Things like paying workers more means more consumption, so it helps the overall economy, and that it discourages people from entering into 'other' sources of income (theft, drugs, etc.).

Anglophones have had a big ongoing discussion for decades (perhaps centuries) about class and race and fairness. On the other hand, the Germans tend to talk about specificities in various branches of academics without deference to such a narrative.

An outcome of this cultural difference is that Germans are seen as imperious hard-asses by people in Mediterranean countries and by Anglophones when Germans protest that people are mad at them because of requirements for bailouts that are seen as unfair.

I see no good economic arguments for price controls.

&gt;If I was arguing against myself I would look into whether the lack of a minimum wage has led Germany to have a disproportionate number of foreign workers.

What about it?

&gt;all the migrants go there thus helping the German economy, whilst the rest of Europe with its minimum wages get crippled on labour costs and consequent productivity decline

Then the rest of Europe is to blame. Though there are plenty of other EU countries without statutory minimum wages.

&gt;Secondly it prevents worker abuse. Without a minimum wage competition could lead private sector wages to decrease to an absolute minimum.

It absolutely does not. Yes, no minimum wage would lead to lower average wages but it would also lead to higher average incomes.

For example: if you have an economy where there's three people, one earning 500€, another 1000€ and another 1500€ and you set a minimum wage of 750€, you'll go from a situation where the average wage rises from 1000€ to 1250€ but where the average income drops from 1000€ to 833€.

&gt;The converse could be argued of course, that one employer offers a slightly higher wage and duly hires all the most productive staff. That's great for business, but I believe its a failure of society if that is the case.

I don't understand, are you talking about efficiency wages?

&gt;it can be argued that no minimum wage leads to even greater disparity between workers

The greater disparities appear when you restrict some people free movement within the labour market. [Here's a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DS0XXFdyfI) explaining the impacts of such a policy on blacks in the USA.

&gt;Thus minimum wages increase the quality of life for workers at the bottom (bad for business, but a good objective for any government).

Bad for business? Bad for the unemployed worker, you mean! The minimum wage doesn't increase the wages of the people at the bottom, it just gets those who happen to be below the threshold fired. [Here's a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct1Moeaa-W8) explaining the situation that actually takes place.

&gt;Things like paying workers more means more consumption, so it helps the overall economy, and that it discourages people from entering into 'other' sources of income (theft, drugs, etc.). 

The main problem is that a minimum wage doesn't actually increase the wages of those who are worse off, it in fact hurts them much more than it actually helps them.",1,1364141686,null,0,false,0,c91iqv4,t3_1awp39,t1_c91iqv4,t1_c91iisj,null,1431687365,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

You're right here in that the rest of Europe would become more competitive if there were no minimum wages. Though wages, again as you argue, are only one part of the argument. If there's no competition between countries in terms of wages, then there will be elsewhere. Welfare state, crime rates, education, geographical location (resources and transport links to other countries). For instance, a factory in Greece, Portugal, or Cyprus gets screwed because transport costs to the rest of the EU are massive. That's simple geography, let alone the lack of infrastructure. Maybe all this supports your argument, but it ultimately comes down to Germany &gt; Europe (I'm British btw, this isn't blind patriotism). You think we are reliant on Germany now, just wait to see if the Euro implodes. The Bundesbank ran European economies pre-EMU. And unlike the ECB it was explicitly in German interest.

&gt;lower average wages but it would also lead to higher average incomes.

Minimum wages are about benefitting individuals, not the state's average. You also need to analyse what these workers are doing to earn their different salaries. If its different jobs then they might earn different salaries with or without minimum. If its the same job but with different companies then competition will cause wages to decrease to the minimum.

&gt;The greater disparities appear when you restrict some people free movement within the labour market

A natural problem of the EU. Yes there are theoretically no restrictions, but in reality people from Greece don't want to move en masse to Germany. Its a different country. That's way bigger than moving from South Carolina to Michigan, then to California or Massachusetts. You may argue that's another problem of the EU, I agree it is.

&gt;Bad for business? Bad for the unemployed worker, you mean!

Yes bad for unemployed workers, we agree on that. Also bad for business because they can't employ as many people as before. This is why sweat shops exist. 1,000 workers on $2 a day are more productive than 500 workers on $4 a day. The effects of minimum wage laws on business are the foremost reason why we outsource jobs to India, China, Philippines etc.

I don't understand - yes, of course wage controls are only one part of the problem, but still, abolishing those would be a step in the right direction, the fact that there are other problems doesn't invalidate this one.

&gt;Minimum wages are about benefitting individuals, not the state's average.

Then they should be abolished because they only benefit the unions who get less competition for their labour.

&gt;If its the same job but with different companies then competition will cause wages to decrease to the minimum.

What? No, it's the opposite, the more competition there is among companies for labour, the less bargaining power these will have and the more workers will be able to justify as their pay.

It's simple supply and demand of labour, it's the same reason why when there's high unemployment wages tend to drop, there's too high supply for too little demand and the result is that prices (in this case, wages) fall.

&gt;A natural problem of the EU. Yes there are theoretically no restrictions, but in reality people from Greece don't want to move en masse to Germany. Its a different country. That's way bigger than moving from South Carolina to Michigan, then to California or Massachusetts. You may argue that's another problem of the EU, I agree it is.

Geographical problems and the like can hardly be tackled. But what we do can change and get rid of are the man-made restrictions such as the minimum wage and other policies which act against the free market and serve only to promote unemployment.

&gt;Yes bad for unemployed workers, we agree on that. Also bad for business because they can't employ as many people as before.

I don't understand how you can still support such a short-sighted measures when you acknowledge that it not only fails to achieve its goal of improving the conditions of those who are worse off but that also restricts the ability for workers to find employment and for employers to offer jobs.

&gt;The drug point was a tag on at the end. You're absolutely correct, its just something that is used. Funnily enough studies show that increasing minimum wages actually increases crime amongst youths and migrants (the groups that suffer from minimum wage increases).

Well, no wonder, the more you restrict employment, the more people will resort to alternative means to improve their own lives.

I remember how when I read it for the first time I was searching for where the article I had been reading would continue, but it just didn't. Their articles simply read like introductions and are entirely void of depth, background and analysis, which Focus has the audacity to call ""quicker to the point"" (""the point"", as the O in their logo).

I guess many Greeks don't fully understand the background of this. In Germany, there was sort of ""cultural reset"" after WWII, because practically all previous national heroes and symbols had been abused by the Nazis, and the German Mark had turned into perhaps the most important symbol to represent post-War Germany. It was almost like a fetish. Giving up your currency for a new one sure is a large step for any country, but for Germany it went deeper than probably anywhere else. What our politicians had promised us was that the euro would be just like the DM, so when the story about the misleading accounting broke it really hit home. Might as well have been Kohl instead of Aphrodite, but Markwort would have never allowed that, and it never would have sold paper to Focus' audience. Also, who wants to see a naked Kohl draped in only a flag?

Maybe, maybe not, but I think you are asking the wrong question.

Why not ask for the reasons the Club med waited for so long until they started their reforms?

No one stopped them from doing the same thing Germany did (and yes it is a lot easier to do reforms before it is to late). 
They even could have done it without foreign tax money, because they had still access to *cheap money* from the capital markets. 
A lot of their problems didn't appear over night. 

Why have they waited until they had no other options left and how can we prevent something like that in the future?

Those are the question of interest (for me).

Politicians should do the right thing and not the most popular, is probably one of the issues.

&gt;One of the anomalies of the current law in Spain is that if a homeowner fails to meet a single monthly mortgage payment, the bank can initiate accelerated proceedings to evict the borrower and take possession of the property. Even if the borrower alleges the contract he has signed is abusive and a court agrees with him, if the eviction has already been carried out the homeowner has the right to compensation but not the right to recover the property. The bank can also ask for full repayment of the loan even after obtaining possession of the property in question.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;abolishing those would be a step in the right direction

That depends entirely on your view of what is in the public interest. Even the German government is now moving towards a minimum wage. [Merkel's CDU are campaigning for it.](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/10/30/uk-germany-labour-idUKTRE79T27N20111030) If Germany eliminates this competitive advantage it will be better for the Eurozone and to Germany's detriment.

&gt;What? No, it's the opposite

This depends entirely where power lies in this game. The present state is that Europe has high unemployment. Europe is seen as one due to EU labour market regulations and free movement. So you're absolutely right about supply and demand. The problem is there is a great demand for work, but little supply of jobs. That empowers the employer, not the worker.

&gt;we do can change and get rid of are the man-made restrictions such as the minimum wage and other policies which act against the free market and serve only to promote unemployment.

Again this comes down to competition. We could either abolish minimum wage everywhere, or have a minimum wage everywhere. Government's are moving towards minimum wages (see above for the CDU's new policy of it). The free market is great, but there are areas where it should not be prioritised. According to many government's, minimum wage is one of those areas. In the USA the minimum wage for the 'better' states is higher.

Its also worth adding that the EU is trying to be about more than just an economic zone. If it were merely economic, and people were ok with that, then we'd be looking at managing the decline of nations like Greece and Portugal in order to transform them into more useful regions 'for the benefit of Europe'. EU investment would be predominantly in the regions that are most profitable, which would make nations like Greece and Portugal major net contributors and nations like Germany major net beneficiaries. 

&gt;I don't understand how you can still support such a short-sighted measures

Because the argument is significantly more complex than we are discussing. The vast vast majority of nations have a minimum wage; ultimately the benefits greatly outweigh the costs.

Is that so?

No one knew that the Greeks had a problem with collecting taxes and corruption? Or that Italy need reforms in their labour market, lower their debt level and make a serious effort to fight corruption, too?

I must have imagine the fights between Germany and France to allow Italy to join the Euro. 

But you surly must be joking if you think no one knew about the youth unemployment in Spain.
[Just look at the numbers from the past](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=spain+youth+unemployment&amp;d=MDG&amp;f=seriesRowID%3a597%3bcountryID%3a724).

Even before they joined the Euro the youth unemployment was always over 20% ! 

How can you say no one knew about it?

 * Two genders, that apply to nouns and adjectives, but no cases (only a few leftovers with pronouns).
 * Strongly tied with late spoken Latin, of which it is a direct descendant. Local dialects have strong influences from Spanish and Arab (in the south) and French in the north.
 * 8 verb tenses and several modes, with plenty of exceptions, which make the verbal system probably the hardest thing to learn (""dicevo"" -&gt; ""I used to say/I was saying"", ""direbbero"" -&gt; ""They would say"", ""dicesse"" -&gt; ""Should he say""), probably on par with French and Spanish.
 * Very regular spelling rules, that make writing and reading very simple. We don't even have a verb for 'to spell'.
 * Word order is quite free, with the subject often being optional. This allows for slightly different meanings: ""Vieni?"" -&gt; ""Are you coming?"", ""Vieni tu?"" -&gt; ""Is it you that will come or someone else?"", ""Tu vieni?"" -&gt; ""What about you? Are you coming?""
 * Gestures and tone can indeed further change or add meaning to a sentence. But that's for advanced speakers! 
 * Very high mutual understanding with Spanish. Apart from some hilarious 'false friends' an Italian and a Spanish person can probably understand each other successfully.

Per lo stesso motivo penso che il celibato dei preti, il sacerdozio esclusivamente maschile e cose simili siano del tutto discriminatori, ma in seno alla religione hanno tutto il diritto di esserci. Se non sei d'accordo allora semplicemente non sei cattolico, ma non puoi pretendere che la definizione di cattolico si modifichi per comprendere la tua opinione.

I think the student loan is 600, child support is 180. That's already 780 euro without having worked one single day and I think that's without the bonus for living alone. A 400 Euro job is around 10 hours per week that would mean that you're on 1200 euro with 10 hours additional work every week. Everybody can study in Germany. My mother is a cashier and I manage to do that quite well. 

But it's a waste of time and resources to study if your job doesn't require you to study. You can get good money as an electrician at Siemens but that only requires an apprenticeship which means (compared to a masters degree) you don't waste 8 years you could have used for gathering professional experience.

Wages will fall in nominal terms but the cost of living should follow as the demand for limited cyprian resources shrinks with less Russians.

If they decide to strike out on their own, the value of the new currency will probably do most of the adjusting. Savings will probably be wiped out as the value of the new currency falls.

true,krattr,null,null,"&gt; I guess many Greeks don't fully understand the background of this. [...] What our politicians had promised us was that the euro would be just like the DM, so when the story about the misleading accounting broke it really hit home.

We're on the same page, I was just stressing the importance of communication. It could make all the difference in the world, if used right. It is catastrophic, if used wrong.

Most younger Greeks do understand that the DM was part of the German [collective unconscious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious), an important part of an identity they exchanged, in a way, for another one. They understand that many Germans felt betrayed by what they heard. Similarly, many Greeks that went through a lot and work(ed) hard, felt insulted by extreme media portrayals and suggestions by some German politicians.

Normally I wouldn't use this example, because it might seem like appealing to emotion, but here it is. The father of a living person was killed by Nazis. She was the eldest child and was forced to drop out of school, despite being a brilliant student that was allowed to enter high school years before even finishing primary school. Her mother now needed help in raising her seven children. The state (whatever kind of ""state"" Nazi Greece was) said that the ""compensation bills"" they received for the [loss of their fortune in Asia Minor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_genocide) were no longer valid. The family kept them for a rainy day, but that day came and they couldn't use them. So, this person saw her life changing in a matter of days, without doing anything wrong. No food, no funds. Following more than 50 years of physically demanding work in two and three jobs at the same time, and after raising three children that went on to succeed without hiding or owing a single drachma/euro from/to the state, she heard a news anchor saying that some German magazine talked about ""swindlers"" in the European family.

The number of similar stories in Greece is large; families are close knit and pressing ""that"" button brought the animal instincts on the surface. Saying that Germans living now are Nazis, did the same for the other side.

Regarding the practical issues, a former PM explained that things were not the way they were presented to be (start with the fifth paragraph [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/apr/26/greece-europe-north-south-divide)). The argument against him is that he has to defend his legacy, but despite numerous complaints I personally have against him, at least the explanation about EMU entry makes sense. It should be noted that Sarkozy, which belongs to an opposing political group and was the first raising the matter, did not respond. Neither did the Commission, or anyone else in Brussels.

IMF has been trying to convince Cyprus' president to let the two biggest problem banks be restructured - Laiki and Bank of Cyprus. 

IMF proposal was that in those banks the big deposits would take a haircut of some 30-40%. That way the small insured deposits would be secured up to 100 000€ (i.e. bailing out the people, if you like). 

But if those two banks fail uncontrollably everybody loses a lot, and it would take long time to sort that mess to see who gets what and when. And it wouldn't end there as other Cypriot banks with exposures to those two banks would be seriously hit and probably fail uncontrollably too. And then people with money in those banks would lose their savings etc. It would be a ultimate disaster for Cypriots.

Last weekend Cyprus' president rejected the IMF proposal.

But since then they have had the good sense to actually put Laiki under restructuring.

Now the big question is what happens to Bank of Cyprus?

ehh, while that does guarantee stable majorities, I don't like non-proportional systems for usually diminishing the party options. That both alienates voters that don't feel an affinity the biggest/most mainstream parties, and makes it harder to punish or replace a party when its voters are unhappy with it. 

I mean, I'd prefer parliament with a few parties, but running the full spectrum of left -- center-left -- center -- center-right -- right, with an extra issue-specific party here and there. 

Two-rounds (or a preferential vote) for electing half of the house, with the rest filled from open party lists to maintain overall party proportionality, on a entire-country basis, makes for a parliament that more closely expresses actual citizen's positions. 

And government stability can be guaranteed by other means, than by plurality bonuses as currently, or unproportional elections. Eg joint-sitting prime minister elections, with a secret ballot, with elimination rounds removing the weakest candidate untill you elect a government. And a constructive non-confidence vote, which means that the non-confidence vote to a government must simultaneously be a confidence vote for the next prime minister.

That still can leave the country in a position with a government that doesn't have the majority to push through a law, but must seek ad-hoc coalitions for each text.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;That depends entirely on your view of what is in the public interest.

It's is my view that what's in the public interest is to further the free market and individual liberties and not to restrict people's freedoms to do whatever they please whenever they aren't causing harm to third parties.

The minimum wage is an obvious example of price controls and of restricting both workers and employers of doing what they think is best for themselves - society would be better off if it were abolished. To add insult to injury, it's a policy that makes the poor poorer and restricts the ability of those who are worse off of having any chance at a decent employment, condemning younger less fortunate people and unskilled immigrants to unemployment.

&gt;Even the German government is now moving towards a minimum wage.

Because it's politically profitable. Because so many people think you can make a law and then suddenly everybody will earn more. They'll only be hurting themselves like we're already doing.

&gt;If Germany eliminates this competitive advantage it will be better for the Eurozone and to Germany's detriment.

The Eurozone will not benefit from it. The whole EU could impose a minimum wage and still be harmed by it just like the USA has a federal minimum wage and youth unemployment increases every time they raise it.

&gt;The present state is that Europe has high unemployment.

Higher minimum wage = higher unemployment.

Lower or absence of minimum wage = lower unemployment.

&gt;The problem is there is a great demand for work, but little supply of jobs.

You're getting things switched, it's supply and demand of labour, unemployment is caused by too high supply and too little demand for labour.

[Here's a graph from wikipedia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/07/Wage_labour.svg/500px-Wage_labour.svg.png) that should help in getting the point across, pretend that's in the labour market for fast-food workers.

&gt;That empowers the employer, not the worker.

Yup, the bargaining power of the employee can have a very significant impact in that person's wage.

The way to increase the worker's bargaining power however is not with regulation like the minimum wage but rather to decrease the unemployment rate (so that it's easier for someone to find employment and harder for someone to employ for a lower wage) and to improve that worker's skills (highly skilled workers or those who have worked for a long time in the field may be very difficult and costly to replace and therefore can justify higher wages).

&gt;We could either abolish minimum wage everywhere, or have a minimum wage everywhere.

Not really. You could impose a worldwide minimum wage and enforce it strictly but the principle would still apply - people can't employ at a loss. The higher you raise the minimum wage, the more you require from workers - those that for whatever reason aren't as productive and would generate a loss for employers if they were hired at the minimum wage would become unemployable.

&gt;Government's are moving towards minimum wages (see above for the CDU's new policy of it).

And others are cutting back on it by making them have different values for different people and changing with accordance to the skills of the individual - it's not a perfect system but it's much more politically acceptable than saying you want to abolish the minimum wage and in effect it does lower the people affected by the minimum wage by driving the price below the market equilibrium (in essence, making it redundant just like the minimum wage is redundant for so many people who easily earn more than that).

See [Australia](http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/pages/default.aspx) and [New Zealand](http://www.dol.govt.nz/er/pay/minimumwage/).

I'd still prefer no minimum wage like Norway, Germany or Singapore because it would hurt nobody and remove the restrictions on the labour market and allow plenty of unemployable people to suddenly be able to find a job and improve their lives through work with dignity and not be dependent on social benefits or charity for income.

&gt;The free market is great, but there are areas where it should not be prioritised.

The free market is amazing and as long as there's no negative externalities such as pollution, don't restrict it.

&gt;According to many government's, minimum wage is one of those areas.

And according to many governments, the death penalty is a necessity, gay people shouldn't be able to marry and to promote employment by raising tariffs is a good idea. That's a clear case of the bandwagon fallacy.

&gt;In the USA the minimum wage for the 'better' states is higher.

You're getting cause and effect wrong, precisely because those states are better they can sustain higher minimum wages. But you don't even have to look at the USA for that, [here's the EU situation](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/1/15/MW_map_EUR_January_2013.png). While we're at it, [here's the youth unemployment rate](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/1/13/Youth_unemployment%2C_2011Q4_%28%25%29.png). See the correlation?

&gt;The vast vast majority of nations have a minimum wage

That doesn't mean anything.

&gt;ultimately the benefits greatly outweigh the costs

Financial sectors are international these days, which means that money enters and exits them from throughout the world. Think London, New York, HK, Singapore, Frankfurt, wherever. The Cypriot financial centre exists on the premise of being international. Its favourable double tax treaty with Russia means that it gets tons of money sent to it from Russia, and that it is an intermediary for sending money into Russia. the problem here (for the future), and this links to your second point, is that Cyprus is over reliant on this one aspect.

&gt;Tax avoidance yes, but was it really based around this and not just... big banks?

Cyprus isn't in crisis because of tax avoidance, you're very right about that. General financial crisis, exposure to Greek debt especially, poor government, and some accusations of inefficiency are the reasons why.

But the reason why Cyprus is fucked going forward is largely to do with tax avoidance. As in point one, the Cypriot financial sector is over reliant on tax avoidance as a business. Nobody wants to bail out the rich tax avoider from Russia, but if Cyprus wanted to save its economy then it really has to bow down to these oligarchs. Whether the EU is letting it is another matter of course.

&gt;But it was no need to end in this terribly way which it will

Again, this could've been averted if the EU was willing to bow down to Russian businesses and oligarchs.

So, much of Italy’s interest burden is paid to Italians, and some of it is paid back to the government as taxes. As a result, Italy’s public debt dynamics are better than those of the GIPS.

Said no wedding planner ever.

Seriously, gay marriage is a fucking stimulus package! For free!

~10% of the population is homosexual. This is not the medieval age, homosexuals aren't forced to marry someone of the opposite gender, so we can assume that the vast majority of them is unmarried and childless (I assume that adoption was also an issue).

Being childless means more disposable income. Even if only 50% of them are adult and want to marry, it's now 5% of the population.

So... 5% of the population of France (that's 3.25 million people, or 1.625 million couples) are going to pay thousands of euros each to French companies in the service sector in the next years.

Also, some couples will have children (sperm donation, surrogate mothers, adoption, etc...) which might remove one of them from the job market, creating another opening.

In fact, gay marriage might end up creating jobs.",0,1364162019,null,0,false,0,c91oogb,t3_1ax1xe,t1_c91oogb,t1_c91m3qp,null,1431690227,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Beppe grillo dovrebbe convocare una conferenza stampa e dire: ""Appoggiamo provvisoriamente un governo per approvare le leggi sul conflitto d'interesse, i costi della politica, anticorruzione, legge elettorale... e poi a casa tutti"".
Ciò darebbe un'immagine agli elettori del M5S (di sinistra ei di destra) che il Movimento sta facendo qualcosa. È PRAGMATISMO POLITICO! E questo tipo di strategia raccoglierebbe molti più voti alle prossime elezioni. È una occasione da non perdere. Ma pochi lo capiscono...

se non si sopportano le critiche tanto vale chiudere il blog (o restringerlo a un gruppo di iscritti, che è la stessa cosa)... e fu così che il movimento che combatteva i partiti diventò esso stesso partito...

Se la cosa non ti piace, chiudi il blog ai commenti sgraditi e presentati una volta per tutte non come portavoce ma come capo e padrone del M5S.

* Ciao Beppe, ho notato anch’io quello che dici. Ho chiesto un po’ in giro e mi hanno detto che si chiama RETE. Mi hanno detto che non è una cosa nuova, che gira da almeno 20 anni. Mi hanno anche detto che molti la trovano bellissima e che chiamano “democrazia” questo straparlare tutti assieme. Pensa che mi hanno detto che c’è uno che ci ha costruito un partito proprio basato sulla rete! Povero mondo, Beppe, hai proprio ragione!

* Ma caro Grillo.... E creare un sito per sondaggi on line per persone certificate come hai sempre promesso e mai fatto??? O è più facile dare del troll a chi non la pensa esattamente come te???? Boh!? Tanto fumo niente arrosto....

* MA QUALE COMPLOTTISMO! Io ho votato anche alle primarie. Abbiamo la possibilità di cambiare il paese, possiamo convincere la parte migliore del centrosinistra a seguire le nostre proposte aggirando la loro classe dirigente (che anche loro non sopportano più), e tu, per paura di apparire coinvolto in un inciucio, preferisci stare alla finestra ad aspettare un disastroso inciucio PD-PDL per poter dire ""avete visto che avevo ragione?"", sperando qualche punto in più alla prossima tornata elettorale... e intanto il paese va in malora. CHI POTREBBE FARE E NON FA, DIVENTA COMPLICE. Questo non è coraggio rivoluzionario, questa è VILTÀ.

* Caro Grillo io non ci sto, ho condiviso tante delle tue battaglie, ma ultimamente non condivido la tua linea oltranzista ed ho espresso le mie critiche su questo blog, ma essere considerato schizzo di merda a pagamento è veramente ingiusto e mi offende profondamente. Se pensi che gli 8.000.000 milioni di persone che hanno votato il m5s condividano la tua posizione ti stai sbagliando di grosso.Se pensi che in un un movimento ci sia spazio solo per un pensiero allora dai ragione ai tuoi detrattori. Che in un blog ci siano i troll fa parte delle regole del gioco, ma perché non pensi che i troll non siano quelli che ti sostengono in pieno perché non ti vogliono al governo? Penso che stai commettendo gli stessi errori della casta, chiuso in te stesso senza ascoltare gli altri. Io sinceramente mi aspetto delle scuse.

Malaga: Kind of beach touristy but I'm sure you could find some great restaurants with a minimal amount of scavenging

Granada: Kind of touristy due to La Alhambra (which you need to visit if you are going to Granada). If you don't already have a hotel booked, there is a three-star right up an alley from the river in the old quarter. It is in an old manor house and is really amazingly cool. The rooms are kind of strange due to the antiquity of the building, but that's character. I'll try to find the website. Go up to the gypsy caves on Sacromonte and see some flamenco. Enjoy the best olives you'll have in your entire life.

Cordoba: Kind of touristy due to the mosque. However, there is a ridiculous restaurant nestled within the outer walls of the old quarter called Meson de la Luna. When I visited two years ago a world class chef named Antonio had just opened up shop. I ate there every single night I was there. He gave me some great special treatment after the second night. The food is out of control. Seriously. You must go there.

Anyway, if you are willing to travel a bit I could help you out some more. Hope what I gave you already helps and I'll try to find the website of that hotel in Granada.

Once again, you're portuguese so you should know this: don't trust the cooked up numbers and statistics you see the state throwing about. You know very well this isn't the case - the majority probably earns little more than the minimum wage, believe me.


&gt;That's silly, people are ""greedy"" everywhere, it's human nature to try and pursue what's best for the individual. It's not a bad thing, anyone can (or should be able to - we have plenty of restrictive regulate) become an employer and employers can't just ""take advantage"" because they're dependent on the employees to fulfil a bilateral contract.


Again, you're portuguese so you probably know how this works over here: you are mostly powerless. The justice system is inefficient and prone to hand greasing. You're just a little man being abused by the big corrupt man, unless you start being corrupt too, which many do.


Do you think the people who worked in a fab which conveniently was ""burnt down"" right before the company declared bankruptcy will ever see their 3 months delay in salaries?


""Oh, but they should have gone to the correct authorities to help them get their money back!""


Do you really think that would work?


""Oh, but they should have left their job as soon as the shit started hitting the industrial fans!""


And go where? What job? You don't get unemployment fund if you quit yourself.


It all works perfectly in the correct cultures, but not in our culture. Knucle-headed bosses would take advantage of the absence of minimum wage (shit, they already do with recibos verdes).


No, this wouldn't benefit Portugal the slightest. It could create more jobs but what's the point of working if you can't even feed yourself? I mean, Portugal's minimum wage is already a joke because you can't possibly live by it if you happen to live in a biggish city.


Sorry but no. Portugal's problems are much deeper than simply having a minimum wage. We should start by cleansing the political and banking filth elite and then start opening people's minds to another type of culture.

The former right-wing party, the UMP, is really losing steam since Sarkozy's defeat and the very pathetic fight that the two contenders to his succession had. The opposition to the gay marriage is a way for them to cement again.

They don't rally want, or know how to, attack the government on several issues. In many ways, Hollande is having a right-leaning policy on a lot of things. So, gay bashing is becoming the rallying cry of the UMP, which *needs* it. They are more and more becoming like US Republicans, using religion as their main cement. 

About the freedom of speech, well, the official version is simple : the protest went to a street where it was not allowed, forcing policemen blockage. This was apparently done by far-right-wing groups that engages in fights with the police. This usually triggers a tear-gas retort and the dispersion of the whole protest, and of peaceful protesters receiving tear gas too. This is nothing exceptional and I can only be happy that a former minister experienced first hand what has been the usual practice for at least 15 years. (Christine Boutin, a former minister during Sarkozy's administration was in the protest and it apparently is a scandal that she breathed teargas, duh) 


The police is *always* considered heavy-handed in France when confronting protests.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;You know very well this isn't the case - the majority probably earns little more than the minimum wage, believe me.

I wasn't guiding myself from the statistics but rather from personal experience. I mean, really, how many people you know earn only 485€/month?

&gt;you are mostly powerless.

You're even more powerless when the government restricts the labour market with this kind of regulation and when unemployment rises as a consequence.

&gt;The justice system is inefficient and prone to hand greasing.

And it takes years to get something through the courts, and you're still highly unlikely to see any justice made. Still, I see no arguments for the minimum wage.

&gt;You're just a little man being abused by the big corrupt man, unless you start being corrupt too, which many do.

Unfortunately that too often is the case but again, the minimum wage does nothing in this regard.

&gt;Do you think the people who worked in a fab which conveniently was ""burnt down"" right before the company declared bankruptcy will ever see their 3 months delay in salaries?

As of now I'm much more worried with the only person in my house that has a job having his salary 1 month delayed and going now to the 2nd month..

&gt;""Oh, but they should have gone to the correct authorities to help them get their money back!""

That's a problem of the justice system.

&gt;""Oh, but they should have left their job as soon as the shit started hitting the industrial fans!""
&gt;
&gt;And go where? What job? You don't get unemployment fund if you quit yourself.

A lower or no minimum wage (and lower taxes, fewer restrictions, less bureaucracy, yada yada) would help in reducing unemployment and solve these problems.

&gt;It all works perfectly in the correct cultures, but not in our culture.

That ""culture"" thing is a mistake, people act in accordance to the environment they're in - if we had laws and a society based of work, opportunity and self-reliance, we'd all be better off, there's nothing intrinsically better about the Germans or the people of Hong Kong or the Yankees and there's nothing wrong with us Portuguese or the Greeks or the Venezuelans, it's simply that on the first case it's much harder to live at the expense of others and much easier to keep the product of your labour whereas here and in other countries now going through difficult times you have a state constantly helping people at the expense of some other people and the whole economy starts failing with people pointing fingers and it becoming increasingly difficult for the people to improve their own lives through honest work.

&gt;Knucle-headed bosses would take advantage of the absence of minimum wage (shit, they already do with recibos verdes).

Then remove all the restrictions as well, make it so that everybody can become a boss and so that if people have a hard time finding employment for themselves, they can create their own.

I know this is much more difficult to do than how I'm saying it but the principle is there - remove the restrictions, allow the free market to operate and see the unemployment tumble down while actual incomes raise.

Estonia did it, Poland did it, Chile did it, South Korea did it, Germany did it, Hong Kong did it, Australia did it, Hungary did it, New Zealand did it, India did it.. I'm guessing we won't be the exception.

&gt;No, this wouldn't benefit Portugal the slightest. It could create more jobs but what's the point of working if you can't even feed yourself?

Oh, I don't know, perhaps so that you can get some actual income without having to rely on the state? Perhaps so that you can get something on your CV? Perhaps so that you can learn new skills and meet people in the field? Perhaps so that the rest of society can also benefit from what you're producing rather than being a burden on the rest of society that requires the help of the state?

What would help Portugal then? More youth unemployment? More difficulties for people proving their worth on the job market? More expenses for the state through unemployment subsidies? More social unrest? More restrictions for people to find a job?

&gt;I mean, Portugal's minimum wage is already a joke because you can't possibly live by it if you happen to live in a biggish city.

So you'd raise it to what? 500€/month? 600€/month? 800€/month? According to your logic that we need protection from ourselves or else we might work for too little pay, this would be a good policy!

I mean, why would you bother if the minimum wage here was raised to 800€/month? While you do admit that it could cause some unemployment, I'm sure you'll keep playing that tune of ""the bosses will take advantage, we need to force them to pay out more through increasing the minimum wage"", right? Really, why don't we raise it to 800€/month? It would only amplify its currents effects and if you support it for 485€ you should also support it for 800€, if you think it's a joke as it is, why don't we raise it?

&gt;Sorry but no. Portugal's problems are much deeper than simply having a minimum wage.

Unfortunately you're right. If only it were that simple.

&gt;We should start by cleansing the political and banking filth elite and then start opening people's minds to another type of culture.

true,JimmyLane,null,null,"French people react violently about everything. Remember the French Revolution ? Well, that history of violent overthrows wasn't resolved until the start of 20th century, we idealize so much this part of our past that it shapes the way we ""discuss"". So this level of contestation is not specific to gay marriage. Student strikes where they are breaking windows, worker unions breaking shit up and holding their employers hostage, farmers blocking whole roads and dumping tons of milk and burning tires as a protest. None of this is out of the ordinary in a French news report. 

The people who were protesting here ? They were probably the mildest of protesters especially when you look at the jolly fellows I mentioned above. Children were mentioned and granted they don't have a choice and granted they were some questionable far-right people but you don't bring children to a manifestation if you expect it to go badly. 

Why were they protesting ? I'm not actually against gay marriage and I have little in common with them so it's only suppositions from here. 

First, I will correct one thing : it's not Paris. Most of the people here came from other French regions, more traditional, maybe more religious. A little anecdote : I went jogging Saturday at around 6 am and I saw people coming out of a bus at the Gare Montparnasse ( quite young, around 20 yo ) and they were starting to put some posters on the walls in the streets. So the movement at work here is quite organized and has funding. And they know one thing : like everything that happens in France, none of it matters unless it happens in Paris. That would explain why they would get funds for the trip and organize it here. They would be hard pressed to assemble such a numerous crowd in Pars. Paris is actually pro-gay, because it's very urban, very artsy, there is a gay area and the mayor is gay. Also, gay people with no children and with links to the mentioned fashion, cultural, political crowd have higher disposable income and can more easily afford to live in Paris and influence politics from there.

See, this might not seem important at first but it's actually a common pattern in French politics to have a constant divide between Paris and the Province. It's only natural that something like gay marriage, something very progressive would seem like another insidious way that Paris exert its power over good provincial folks who go to the church and have always lived a good dutiful life. They're not very wrong to think that because as far as power goes, it works exactly like that. There is such a thing as a center of power and some groups who are more attuned to what goes on in Paris have certainly a great deal of influence ( due or undue ) that is difficult to understand from the point of view of an outsider. Why is there a disproportionate amount of Jews or gays on TV ? Why are politicians always married or sleeping with journalists ? That's the kind of questions and every day annoyances that make everything coming from Paris seem dubious or duplicitous to them.

Second, the issue of gay marriage and the opposition to it is as much opportunism, conviction and incomprehension which I will try to develop. 

Incomprehension, because France is possibly going to be in recession this year or the next and unemployment have never been so high and meanwhile the news cycle is being completely saturated with gay adoption or surrogacy debates while very little is being seemingly done as far as giving back a real direction to French policy ( steering the ship if you will ) is concerned. Many people voted for the guy in charge because they felt that was severely lacking during the last presidency. People who are in desperation need to think that something is being done for them, they need to think they are important as well. A crisis calls for exceptional attention. But as far as they are concerned, the current government has done nothing for them : taxes have been raised, no new jobs have been created, their future seem as bleak as it did yesterday and perhaps bleaker. I'm not saying these are the only reasons but a president has never been so unpopular so fast in the current regime. That has got to mean something. And then the gay marriage issue says : ""Look. That's the actual priority of the government right now."" The priority is to take away from them the family model which they've always known. To rewrite the law so that father and mother is replaced by parent 1, parent 2 on official documents and so on. Desperate people need stability and this failure to see that ( even though gay marriage is a perfectly legitimate concern ) reflects the image of an out of touch elite. 

Conviction, well that one is easy because religious and conservative people have trouble allowing new things to happen in society. It's as much about denying the right to gay people to be married as it is about validating their own lives and values. Conformism is a powerful thing. And if you start allowing things that weren't allowed before, terrible things will happen and the more you allow the closer you are to crossing boundaries that seemed so far before. If you allow gay marriage, you allow adoption. If you allow adoption, you allow surrogacy. If you allow surrogacy, you allow buying babies like commodities. Right or wrong, this is a question of values and experiences. And the obvious discrimination that comes from allowing the majority to decide could be balanced by the peace brought by a more homogenous community. Overall it seems there is a real argument against making gay couple into married gay couple into families that the government would be responsible to provide children for, whether they are both males or both females. It has far-reaching consequences that nobody can deny. It is a difficult thing to evaluate on the long term and rushing into it drumming slogans is, in my opinion, an insult to reasonable-minded people. 

Opportunism, because right now, the French right-wing is in disarray. They have been completely smashed in the previous election cycle and the main party, the UMP, has been discredited through the fraudulent election of its current president in January. They need to turn back the tide. They need an issue that would stir their troops, something that could unite them. Gay marriage is an easy thing and the best thing for them. Why ? Because it's easy to understand : they're the conservatives and that is their common trait. But mainly because they don't know exactly what to say about the current economic or social policies that are being drafted. A lot of bad decisions were made by Nicolas Sarkozy to be sure but they can't talk about that right now, a lot of the measures now taken could also have been taken by them ( Current government was against the VAT increase when they were in the opposition, repelled the law when they came into power, and are planning to increase it again, talk about confusing the shit out of everyone.. ), and it's very, very difficult to criticize an economic decision when you don't know if it is gonna be successful or not. Their problem is they're walking a very thin line between being against gay marriage as ""unnecessary and against common sense"" and homophobia. It is to be noted though that the younger of them are quite obviously a lot more moderate on the issue, since they can feel perfectly where the wind blows. 

That's my 2c, and there's no tldr.

I have explained this to you before a few times but I can do it again, greeks are taught to strictly marry/have relationships with only those of there own culture. It is just how it has always been since Ancient times. Greeks in general are an extremely insular people and take there religion seriously. For example, greece is the only country in the western world to have a state religion due to the prominent role it played during the ottoman rule. So 99.5% of greeks marry other greek christain orthodox people because they want there children to have the same type of childhood and upbrining they had, which is natural for many people around the world, you can look at the japanese for very similair traits.

Where I live in Greece, Rodos . . . it is unheard of for a greek and albanian to be dating, it is just a taboo to do. Even marrying italians/spaniards is frowned on, not because people think there is anything really wrong with it but because the traditions of marrying greeks with other greeks is at the core of greek culture itself.

- Metropolitan transport refers to underground, bus, tram and FGC, all transports inside the metropolitan area in Barcelona.

Your transport ticket is useful for all of them, and you can change from one to the another during a single trip.

- Train transport is run by Renfe, and covers longer distances than metropolitan transport. Rodalies is the shortest train service, but it still covers longer than AMB. Ownership did not change, but management of the service was transferred to the regional government a couple years ago. Hopefully they will merge into AMB like all the others did, but this is not the case yet.

Renfe considers the airport to be in zone 2, and AMB considers it to be in zone 1. AMB does not matter a lot in this case, because they don't cover the airport. An underground line (L9) is planned and under construction, but will take a wahile.

Depending on who you are flying with and where you need to go, you should also consider Airbus. That is a private service running from both terminals to Plaça Espanya and Plaça Catalunya. It costs around 6€, but is more frequent than the train and you can take it in Terminal 1.

Everyone has known the banks were failing for over a year, but the previous inept president did not act. So, Cyprus elects a new president, and all of a sudden the banks must be shut down and the people's money held hostage until a ""deal"" is reached. Why now? Why not a year ago? Why not a month from now? We were told that the ""deadline"" was Monday (today), because banks were due to reopen on Tuesday. Guess what? Banks are NOT reopening on Tuesday, and it is unknown when they will reopen. One wonders what the hell they were discussing in that Eurogroup meeting if not when the banks should reopen and how the inevitable bank run will be managed. Clearly that is the most crucial issue to deal with right now, all the things they actually talked about and decided are totally fictitious amounts that get tossed around and represent NOTHING. And the capital controls that were supposedly decided upon to prevent the bank run? They actually haven't been decided upon at all. All that was decided was that there will be capital controls, that Cyprus has no say on what they will be, and that we will be informed of what they are whenever they (Eurogroup) deem it necessary.

As for the bailout numbers, they have been changing daily without any explanation as to how they were derived. In the latest Eurogroup press conference, Dijsselbloem actually said ""forget the 5.8bn number, we are no longer using that"", as if you can just ignore a number that you've actually used as justification to loot people's savings. Amazingly, we actually ended up with LESS information after that press conference than before it began. Every hard question asked in that press conference was expertly skirted around or blatantly ignored by the officials. Of course, the Cypriot journalists were either painfully silent or altogether absent - they were even late to Finance Minister Sarris's conference right after the Eurogroup one. That conference was a total fiasco, Sarris managed to say even less than Dijsselbloem.

My personal opinion is that you should call a spade a spade, and either you are for treating homosexuals as second class citizens (no marriage, no adoption etc), in which case just accept that your homophobic, or you are for equality, in which case this law is just removing another type of discrimination.

First of all, Cyprus gave loans to Greece, **as a state**, during the ""bailout"" programs.

Second, the Cypriot state doesn't need a ""bailout"" for itself. It needs cheaper loans than what the markets are offering, because two large Cypriot banks are facing problems. If these banks collapse the state will have to take over. These Cypriot banks had to forgive 6 billions during the Greek PSI program. 6 billions is the exact amount that Cyprus has to find from the bank restructuring and the levy on deposits. In addition, the Cypriot economy lost 3 billions from the explosion in Mari.

That means that if you buy a **SINGLE** ticket in RENFE vending machines, they will charge you a 4-zone single ticket,
so, ""DON'T DO THAT"", as it's REALLY expensive. It's a bit of a ""hidden scam"" from their part.

On the other hand, ALL other transport operators in Barcelona consider airport being in Zone-1 (it physically IS in zone 1). So if you get a single ticket on vending machines OUT of RENFE (i.e. Metro, FGC, etc...) You will legally reach there with a Zone-1 Ticket.

Finally, if you move with public transport in Barcelona, you'll probably be getting a Zone-1 T-10 travelcard (~10 €), which is just 10-tickets stacked onto a travelcard (AND HALF the price of 10 single tickets). 

With a Zone-1 T-10 you're more than able to reach to/from the airport, or so I did some months ago. The person in charge at the station told me it's more than legal doing that. I haven't heard any change on this lately.

ALL that info is what I remember from my last visit to the airport (some months ago). Maybe RENFE changed the Zone-4 specification onto Zone-2. But all other T-10 info should be valid as of today. So go for the T-10 solution and/or Single-Ticket obtained from a NON-RENFE vending machine.

People, correct me if I'm wrong :)

EDIT: Spanish wikipedia seems to support my theory :) So the final word should be: DON'T BUT ANYTHING FROM A RENFE VENDING MACHINE, (except a zone-1 T-10) and you're safe.

BTW: T-10 travelcards are valid in BUS, Metro, FGC, TRAM, and Renfe/Rodalies. Just one usage, and you have 1h15m to travel around, even changing transports (BUS + Metro + FGC + RENFE).

Naja, ""**abgezockt**""? 
Die hohen Zinsen, die mangelnde Kontrolle der Geldflüsse, das ist Abszocke.
Aber das Reiche und Ultrareiche nicht ihr gesamtes Geld wiederbekommen ist doch nur verständlich.
Auch der deutsche Einlagensicherungsfond deckt nicht 1milliarde Euro Privatvermögen ab.

Zypern ist ja an sich ein absolutes Kackland, also keine Wirtschaft, kaum politische Vielfalt, hoher Korruptionsindex...und wenn ich dauernd sehe das die deutsche Flaggen verbrennen, weil Sie glauben Merkel hätte die Abgabe auf kleine Vermögen vorgeschlagen, haben die offensichtlich auch ein grottenmieses Bildungsniveau, denn der Vorschlag JEDEN Sparer zu beteiligen, war ausdrücklicher Wunsch der zyprischen Regierung.

Warum jetzt trotzdem die Presse (BILD,SPON usw.) rumheult liegt daran, dass der Geldadel...also die Inhaber eben jener Verlage genauso seeehr viel Geld verlieren wie VW,Thyssen und die anderen Diebe auch.
(Warum hat Volkswagen in Zyper,Amsterdam usw. Briefkastenfirmen?Egal.)
Vorallem das ""viel Mehr"" nervt die. Bisher waren es vielleicht 10% die den oberen 1% weggenommen werden würden - jetzt sind es 20%...bei manchen vielleicht sogar mehr.
Das schwächt den Einfluss von Oligarchen in Russland genauso wie die Wirtschaftseliten hier in Deutschland.

Welchen Grund hat denn die britische Rentenkasse gehabt Ihr Geld in Zypern anzulegen?
Riiiichtig, weil es Schweine sind: Anstatt solidarisch die eigene Nation zu stärken hat sich EU&amp;Euro Hasser England entschieden die eigene Bevölkerung zu bescheissen, indem man Geld ausser Landes schafft.
Da die Rentner dort wie hier jedes Jahr utopische Erhöhungen fordern, die Investitionen für die Zukunft unmöglich machen, muss das Geld ja irgendwo her kommen...z.B. aus Zypern, die solche Geldflüsse nicht kontrollieren (wollten).

Bien que la majorité de l'immigration française soit d'origine maghrébine et donc de culture musulmane je ne pense pas que l'essentiel des problèmes dont on est témoin en Europe face à ce type d’immigration soit dû à une intolérance des dits Européens envers une religion en particulier. Bien sûr on aura toujours des anti-sémites, des anti-islam et même des anti-protestants mais ça ne représentera jamais 51% de la population qui coexiste très bien, notamment en raison d'un sécularisme généralement répandu.

En revanche les problèmes sont plutôt liés à une intégration ratée par les dirigeants et une acculturation ressentie comme brutale de la part des autochtones comme des immigrés. Rajoutez à cela une bonne dose d'inégalité sociale et laissez mijotez 50 ans, un lapse de temps extrêmement court dans l'histoire des mouvements de populations, et vous obtenez la situation actuelle par laquelle les français, comme beaucoup d'autres peuples européens, ne souhaitent plus faire preuve de tolérance à l'égard de l'étranger, d'où qu'il soit, et les moindres faits qui traduisent une rencontre de deux cultures (exemple, la nourriture halal dans les cantines, le voile ou les minarets) deviennent des points d'achoppement. 

En bref, l'intolérance à l'égard de l'islam est un effet et non la cause.

Just because marriage evolved as something _directed_ at and _tending towards_ baby making, it does not mean it has to be 100% focused on it. In fact when gay marriage will be 100% accepted it will _still tend_ towards baby-making on the whole - our complaint is that it now _tends more away from it_!

&gt;A mosque will attract other Muslim-oriented businesses around it, thus creating a Muslim hub/village. Also, when allowed mosques broadcast calls of prayer 5 times/day.
&gt;
&gt; Each mosque is a beacon of Islamic cultural victory in France.



**1. Increasing from what?**

Of course the number is increasing, there were extremely few mosques, and there still are too few, if you consider the population they serve.

As a percentage of French population, people having ""serious"" religious involvement (that is, not just going to religious ceremonies twice a year for the major feasts) are divided in the following way:

- Roman Catholics: 2-3%
- Protestants: 1.5-2%
- Jews: 1-1.5%
- Muslims: 2-3% (and falling quickly as the years go by)
- Others: &lt;0.5%

Religious activity is a small minority phenomenon in France, a deeply secularized society. The small number of people who practice Islam should have the run of decent facilities to do it, in the same exact way other denominations do it, period.

**2. Muslim-oriented businesses?**

Seriously? Have you ever been near a French mosque? There are no such things.

Yes, I live right next street to the local mosque, in one of the poorer parts of the Paris suburbs.

And before you ask, I'm a devout and practicing Christian. I'm also French, white, male, heterosexual and married with children. All of which shouldn't matter, but is here stated because it will go against your prejudices.

**3. What calls for prayer?**

France is a secular society. Even the Catholic churches tend to shut up their bells. As stated earlier, my local mosque certainly doesn't call for prayer, even for the major feasts.

And I'm not aware of any mosque anywhere in France that does that.

**Conclusions**

These questions of yours do not say much about France, but they say a lot about your neuroses and prejudices.

| Country | Rank | HDI | Life expectancy at birth | Mean years of schooling | Expected years of schooling | GNI per capita | GNI rank - HDI rank | Nonincome HDI |
|:--------|:-----|:----|:-------------------------|:------------------------|:----------------------------|:---------------|:--------------------|:--------------|
| UK | 26 | 0.875 | 80.3 | 9.4 | 16.4 | 32,538 | -5 | 0.886 |
| US | 3 | 0.937 | 78.7 | 13.3 | 16.8 | 43,480 | 6 | 0.958 |
| Ireland | 7 | 0.916 | 80.7 | 11.6 | 18.3 | 28,671 | 19 | 0.960 |
| Canada | 11 | 0.911 | 81.1 | 12.3 | 15.1 | 35,369 | 5 | 0.934 |

The main difference seems to be the mean years of schooling. I wonder if that is to do with how it is counted, as a mean of 9.4 would mean many people getting less than 9 years of schooling; given that compulsory education starts at 5(ish), that would be to 14... but compulsory education used to end at 16, now I think it's 18. So something seems odd there.

It's interesting to see that the UK is the only country on that list with a higher HDI rank than a GNI one - so the other countries may be being pulled up by their average income per capita. As mentioned elsewhere, this may be unreliable (particularly for the US) where there is significant inequality.

The trade balance would shift to their advantage, as their product could be sold in Europe but not the reverse.

&gt;Brazil exports quite a lot and has a lot of restrictions to imports, and it's only hurting them, they'd be better off if they allowed cheaper foreign goods in.

Only if their own industry could compete. Otherwise, they would just bankrupt some of their own companies and be dependent on foreign products. Your home industry won't improve incrementally due to market forces if there is none left.

&gt;What about transportation costs and the like?

At this point they're no longer prohibitive. For highly specialized, high value to weight products like electronic parts this already happens to some extent. It has some advantages, but it's difficult to recover elsewhere when trade becomes disrupted for some reason (eg. fuel price fluctuations) and is vulnerable to local freak accidents (eg. flooding in Thailand caused a noticeable price rise of hard disks).
