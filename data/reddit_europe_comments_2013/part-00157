I'll post here what I can read, hoping other eyes will be able to do better than me.

It's alas incomplete, but quite interesting, historically.

The letter is addressed thus:

    A S. Ecc.
    X X X Venceslao Martinengo
    delle Palle S X Ciambellano
           Venezia

Venceslao Martinengo delle Palle was a noble from the Lombardo-Veneto (the area of Italy that was under Austrian rule in 19th century)

There a few of them with this name, this post:
http://www.iagiforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=6043#p78649
seems well informed and lists a genalogy of them. Bear in mind that da cui: in this context means ""from whom (descends):""

in that list, this guy:

N.H. Venceslao (* 5-9-1797 + 19-6-1880),

seems to be a good candidate as a recipient of your letter, because of the dates. There might be other Venceslaos in the family not listed in that list, for example nephews or uncles of that guy.

N.H. means Nobil Huomo (noble man)

EDIT: the same guys is listed here: http://bit.ly/133Rlfm with a more complete name and a slightly different list of sons. It always strikes me how high mortality was in children even of rich families; three of his seven childres are listed as dead in very young age. What must it have been in poorer families!

Here: http://bit.ly/17jM2to a Venceslao Martinengo is listed as Assessore, and later Deputato, so he had something to do with public offices, like our Venceslao, who is called Ciambellano

EDIT: there's plenty to search about him and his family, if you are interested, like for example this posting: http://www.iagiforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=8968#p109330

Anyway, returning to your letter...

The Xs above are letters that I can't reliably read, it might be something like:

    A S. Ecc.
    Ill. C. Venceslao Martinengo
    delle Palle S X Ciambellano

this would translate: ""to his Excellence, the illustrious count Venceslao Martinengo delle Palle ...""

and the letter stops there.

A rough translation...

The first paragraph is uncomprehensible, only thing that makes sense is ""with the possile inquiries"".

Second paragraph:
""Still bad news about my horses, and Your Excellence should leave the thought (of them), leaving me the sorrow not to be able to serve You, in comparison of which the sorrow of having ill horses is nothing"" [EDIT: better reading thanks to /u/Orioh]

The sense I get is: My horses are still ill, and I can't sell them to you. I am sorry about not being able to serve you, more than of having ill horses.

third paragraph: 
As Dr. ..... has ordered me in Venice, and I'll go there on the 25th or 26th of the same month to ....

(someone (a doctor?) called him in Venice)

fourth paragraph:
My sons, with respectful gratitude, XXXX your salutations and entrust me to extensibly reciprocate to all the -

The sense I get is: my sons thank you for your salutations and tell me to reciprocate to all the (family?)

The ""extensibly reciprocate"" is interesting as it is (without great doubt) ""contraccambiare estensibilmente"" in italian, and it makes very little sense. Actually, it's completely broken italian (just like it's broken english). It could be better if it were ""estensivamente"" (in the old maning of ""by extension"") but I'm pretty sure it's written as ""estensibilmente""

I would say that the writer has rather poor grammar, or perhaps has a very strong influence of a dialect I can't grasp, or more probably is just trying to write in a grand style and fails miserabily. 

That would help explain why so many words are difficoult to graps from the context, as they are just badly used.

That's what I was able to get. It was intriguing but pretty hard.

I'll try re-reading it tomorrow (it's 3 am here now) and I'll see if I can read more or better.

If anyone want to step in with better readings, that would be great.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"I don't think that is aggressive foreign policy. That happens frequently. Consider how many industries, such as gasoline refineries, have been nationalized and turned over to a domestic company that is de-facto ran by the state. This has happened many times in the past. Often it is the corporation that made the heavy investment and the government either pitched in a little or considered granting licenses in the first place to be enough. That sort of stuff can cost a company billions. I think it is quite right that a company should be able to sue in that case. You mentioned you were in Australia, well that country relies heavily on it's mining done domestically, but *also* what those countries do abroad. Australia has some of the largest mining companies in the world. Do you think an Australian company should be able to sue to recoup losses if it built some massive mining operation in Indonesia and they decided to nationalize it?

Also, on the court thing, the cases that go all the way to the top to the Supreme Court are inherently tricky to resolve, and rely heavily on interpretation and past precedence. I read a lot of international news, and if there is one thing that is distorted about our news, I think it is court cases (and rulings in congress). By nature of the cases that go to the Supreme Court, they aren't always cut and dry. There is an inherent philosophical element to this. Because of this, court cases (and some decisions in congress) can have a partisan edge them. However, it is the various media outlets themselves that have a partisan edge to them that amplify this effect. I mentioned international media earlier because this is where the problem gets amplified. Everytime I read about cases on international media, facts are omitted that aren't convenient to the message the media outlet wants to send out, other facts are heavily distorted. When I read those articles I usually think to myself ""If I didn't know any better, and I just read this article, I would think America was a country full of jack asses"".

Just consider that you are being presented a very manufactured perception of America by both your own domestic media, and American media itself. Perception is very different from reality.

true,the1337tum,NEWZ,New Zealand,"No, that's just the American way of writing law. The reason you have all your 'philosophical' arguments in the supreme court is either because your legislators wrote shitty law or because your courts overstep their authority. 

A point and counter point:

 - the British court of appeal recently rules on the right to die for a patient. ""our responsibility is to discover the relevant legal principles, and apply the law as we find it. We cannot suspend or dispense with primary legislation.""

 - the US supreme court rules on the constitutionality of gay marriage, despite having no explicit reference for or against what is essentially a legal contract between two individuals.

But, as far as I can tell, that is just the tip of the ice berg. US laws are now so large and complex that they incorporate a legal structure that allows them to grow as new instances arise: the Frank-Dodd act being a prominent example of regulation that requires regulators to create more regulations as cases present themselves. This law arose from having many competing interests and a broad policy scope, and yet instead of creating law with clear legal parameters for businesses to operate in, they create law that grows as industry finds new ways to get around it.

And this is where the Trans-Pacific Partnership comes in. While you say there are 'points and counter points', I say there are legal principles and respect for other countries jurisdictions. If you happen to be a very poor jurisdiction whose businesses cannot afford fuel to make a profit, or whose population would starve without assistance, then you have a duty to your ensure your citizens and businesses can survive.

The proposal favours large international corporations and is being pushed through when our economies are doing well enough that food and fuel is not a problem. But there may well be a time when one of our economies suffers a serious economic downturn due to an asset bubble, and then must devalue its currency to recover. In doing so, it must give temporary assistance to businesses and individuals who might otherwise be priced out. But the treaty now forbids them to do that without applying the subsidy to international business as well. And so the nation suffers and struggles to recover all because they signed an expansive legal treaty that automatically grows to encompass markets as they emerge.",0,1375327128,null,0,1375351789,0,cbejgss,t3_1jch9b,t1_cbejgss,t1_cbeia06,null,1429987151,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I've always been frustrated with this criticism of European defence in that people point out ""oh look, you **relied** on US support to do this mission. It because you used some US intelligence and because Americans flew a couple of bombing runs you are obviously completely incapable of doing anything without US help"". It doesn't add up for me. Yes, we always use US help. What can I say, the US is an ally and given that their defence spending is more than the rest of the world combined it would seem like they were shunning Europe if they refused to help at all, which American assistance is always used. They tried to make France pay for the usage of some equipment put they flat out refuse and then America offered them it anyway. For free. This was during Mali. 

Yeah, sometimes European militaries show signs of strain. Just because things didn't go amazingly super perfect does not mean that we cannot sustain a minor or even a major war if we desired. Yeah, we ran low of a certain kind of bomb. It's not like we could have acquired more else were or used a different kind of bomb or even used a different kind of tactic.

It's not like we could have just coughed up the extra expense if we needed to, it just so happens that we didn't want to or need to and the US was more than willing to just provide the support and continues to give such military support freely. 

There's a criticism among American generals against Europeans that European countries don't spend enough on their militaries.

I mean, European operations like Mali and Libya have been relatively successful compared to Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. I want to avoid making judgements on why those conflicts went much better than US led ones, but I will point out that they were far better operations due to (A how brief they were and (B how few Western lives were lost. Generally A also means that relatively few native lives were lost also.

So I think things can be learned from European campaigns, but I'm also sure that not all conflicts can be solved that way and sometimes you have to put boots on the ground and you'll be in a war where you're just going to suck at it.

What happened was that he was president during may 68. You may have heard of it, it was our riot-month in our hippie year. Students making barricades in Paris, calling for the revolution, anarchists bringing back memories of the Parisian commune. Quite a good time...

Now De Gaulle was a symbol of conservatism: a military leader, former fighter in both World Wars, strict catholic, in favor of moral conservatism, death penalty, strong opponent to communists, and so on. The young generation had grown with only De Gaulle as a leader. They wanted to try something else.

Yet, he was not disliked by the majority, even at this time. He did what a courageous leader does in front of riots: he dissolved the parliament, and called for new elections, implicitly (or explicitly? I don't remember) saying he would resign without a majority. He got a strong one. (60/40) He then re-established order, as he could call the revolutionaries wannabes illegitimate and anti-democratic, and a year later he made a referendum on a constitutional reform, that was actually understood as a referendum about him as a president.

Come mi immagino la cosa: la laguna è di solito separata dal mare da un sottile diaframma di sabbia, che d'estate, quando meno acqua scorre, le onde riescono ad ammassare sabbia allo sbocco del fiume: l'acqua filtra sotto la sabbia, e quindi il mare riceve acqua filtrata, meno torbida.  

D'inverno (e a ogni pioggia, immagino), invece, l'acqua spazza via il diaframma e passa sopra. cfr questa foto: http://www.repubblica.it/images/2013/07/31/115101691-27a95d64-cc2d-4e4f-a80c-88af992fd2e2.jpg dove si vede chiaramente che l'acqua esce dalla laguna senza che questo sia un ""DISASTRO AMBIENTALE!""

Immagino che in questo periodo, il diaframma fosse particolarmente sottile, e ad esempio bastassero 20 metri di un canale della dimensione di una paletta per dar sfogo all'acqua della laguna, che (sempre ad esempio) in quel momento era 30 centimetri più alta del mare.

Una volta aperto il canaletto, con quei chilometri quadrati di laguna alle spalle, fermare l'acqua sarebbe praticamente impossibile.

E in questo periodo mi immagino l'acqua della laguna bella verdastra, che VISIVAMENTE sembra sporcare il mare.

La città è frenetica e si muove ad una velocità anormale: questo porta le persone a correre per rimanere al passo. Lo stress si accumula sul lavoro e si sfoga poi nei rapporti sociali: gli automobilisti incazzati in settimana sono gli stessi ciclisti incazzati nelle passeggiate domenicali. Stringere rapporti solidi e profondi è difficile. I prezzi sono tendenzialmente più alti, dalle case alla frutta. La sicurezza personale non è estremamente a rischio, ma è qualcosa su cui non si può soprassedere. Queste sono cose trasversali, che impattano su tutti. Non la presenza o meno di una palestra o di Fastweb, che invece per qualcuno possono essere fattori di qualità, cosa che tu non riesci a concepire e sulla quale ti inviterei a riflettere (ma dai, le persone sono diverse? Hanno gusti e interessi diversi? Com'è possibile!).

Per rispondere anche a /u/brurino aggiungo che sebbene piena zeppa di opportunità, probabilmente queste sono più sfruttabili da persone più giovani o comunque senza bimbi: sono più che certo che una famiglia con figli ricerchi fattori di qualità della vita che Milano non riesce a dare.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;There are three overall competition strategies: cost leadership, quality and concentrating to a niche segment. 

You forget practices like advertising, buying up competition, blocking competition by buying up patents etc.

&gt;And do remember that if prices aren't low enough or quality high enough, there is always opportunity for a new entrant coming into a market, good example of this is Apple that entered and stormed the smartphone market.

One can hardly call Apple a new entrant in the IT market.

&gt;And what is bad with this?

Because there are many ways to make money end up in your pocket, and not all of them generate benefits for society.

&gt;Profits always go somewhere, mostly to common people whose pension funds have been invested to multitude of stocks and assets. And what is bad for example private investors getting profit for their capital? Many people work and save up part of their paychecks to invest into stocks, thus injecting capital and valuations to the market.

You seem to suffer from the delusion that owning stock is something as common as common as owning pants. It isn't, barely 10% of the population has *some*, most people don't have the disposable income, reserves to be able to take the risk and/or expertise to do so. And within these 10% most stocks are owned by a minority as well.

Even pension funds and the like only indirectly transfer that wealth. If they make more than expected, there again the top gets first picks.

&gt;Actually ms. Hilton has made her own fortunate, do remember that she was made disinherited by her grand father. Currently she is worth approx 30 million Euros, largely earned from her TV-series and line of fragrances.

But not by her father. If she was born Paris Miller nothing of it would have happened. She was born with the fame and credit rating of the Hilton family, and without it she wouldn't be rich.

&gt;That is actually not true. Most colonial possessions that western countries had were either loss makers

So *definitely* an expansionist culture then. Did you account for the trade benefits (fleet support) etc. these places gave?

&gt;and even only handful of countries had any possession, namely UK, France, Spain and Portugal.

Please. Netherlands, Belgium, Scotland and failed tried but bundled their efforts with the UK later, Germany, Italy, Russia, the Scandinavians tried too, etc. Every rich country except Switzerland. And they provided mercenaries to the whole of Europe. Not to mention that individuals of other countries also found their way to these colonies.

&gt;What made western countries rich as was ever continuing industrialization and development made possible by moving to a capitalist society driven by market economy.

And to achieve that eg. the UK needed cheap cotton from slaves and then they still had to destroy the local textile industry in India in order to be able to compete.",0,1375346880,null,0,false,0,cbeofqn,t3_1iyn0m,t1_cbeofqn,t1_cbaobti,null,1429984832,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

My point is calling yourself English-American is highly unpopular, if you look at the census data it dropped massively in 1990 50,000,000 people declared complete or partial ancestry, in 2010 only 26,000,000.

These people didn't disappear, but tracing English ancestry is harder. As you pointed out people change their names to English names. Also if you look at [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_immigration_statistics) you will notice British immigrants make up the largest numbers each decade over the past 200 years and long before that. The only exception being Mexico in the past few decades.

These people don't just vanish. You will never get exact numbers, and many people of course have mixed ancestry.

L'insémination artificielle avec sperme de donneur (IAD) peut être une solution à un problème d'infécondité en cas d'absence de spermatozoïdes ou de maladie héréditaire **chez l'homme**. Elle est encadrée par les lois de bioéthique.

L'absence d'un homme, ce n'est pas pareil que la stérilité totale de l'homme. La PMA pour les couples homos, c'est la même chose que la PMA pour **les personnes seules** (manque d'une personne) et différent de la PMA pour les couples hétéros (maladie).

&gt;Ce modèle marche très bien aujourd'hui avec les couples hétérosexuels

Bah non, honnêtement renseigne toi. La PMA actuelle (i.e. en cas de maladie) est longue et il faut avancer tous les frais. Les couples lesbiens ne sont pas malades, ce ne sera donc ni prioritaire donc encore plus long, ni remboursé.

Il faut un statut des parents non-biologiques, ceci valable à la fois pour les couples homos et pour les familles recomposées.

Le seul problème que je vois est idéologique. Vouloir conserver la personne de sexe opposée ayant permis la procréation ( GPA ou PMA ) dans la vie de l'enfant est, d'après moi, ressenti par les couples de même sexe comme un refus de leur statut de couple comme les autres ( alors que l'égalité conçue en droit c'est qu'il y a des situations différentes qui appellent des solutions différentes dans le respect d'un certain nombre de principes et qu'ils sont, de toute évidence sur la question de la procréation au moins, des couples différents ). Et que donc il est impossible de penser recevoir des conseils ou instaurer un vivre-ensemble avec une tierce personne qui en signifiant qu'elle veut s'impliquer, dit aussi qu'elle ne fait pas confiance au couple en raison de sa différence. Donc c'est dans la droite lignée du reste. Pas possible de transiger.

Le reste est pas tellement différent de la situation actuelle si on voulait vraiment légiférer de façon à ce que tous les individus concernés par la naissance de l'enfant qui est l'aboutissement d'un certain nombre de décisions et d'actes librement consentis par chacun ( même les donneurs de gamètes ) sont impliqués et que ça crée des droits dont on ne peut être délesté contre son gré concernant l'enfant mais aussi des devoirs vis-à-vis de la personne qu'il va devenir, l'anonymité du donneur, par exemple, étant une atteinte à l'intérêt de l'enfant.

In the end, even the carrier that stuffed the letter in the mailbox cannot swear an oath that I received that letter. Unless he hides in the bushes and records me personally opening the mailbox and taking out the letter.  
  
If there was no wide understanding that even a letter in a mail box could get destroyed or stolen or god knows what, why would there be the registered mail service? Why even bother? Just send it by regular mail and if the guy doesn't react sue em on the grounds of ""well, he got the letter, I am sure.

You are wrong, and its dangerous. 

Even seemingly timid bits of information is important. Say like what you are eating. Let's say you are a official in a vegetarian organization and share your grocery lists online. Let's say you aren't 100% true to the cause and knots down some minced meat for a juicy hamburger in that list. 

What if NSA, or some other security service wanted to put some pressure on you? Maybe your dad works at a power plant where they want a USB stick inserted into a computer? Are you willing to risk your friend's trust in the vegetarian organization knowing you bought minced meat unless you casually drop that USB stick at the reception desk for the nosey receptionist to insert in her computer?

I agree that this scenario seems really paranoid, but maybe that organisation is really really important to you (and everyone else in it would just kick you out and de-friend you on facebook if they found out, omfg the horrorz). 

Are you willing to be outed as a homosexual (not that dangerous in norway, but is in other countries) based on your friend lists? Because NSA can tell if you are gay based on your contact network alone (some of your friends are publicly gay, and based on % they can tell).

Those snide comments you made about socialists/communists/capitalists/immigrants? Can you handle a fake trial brought on where you are accused of hate speech? 

I have personally received legal threats from the EU from respected law firms that I do not wish to fight (this was a copyright thing where I used a companies name, and the website in question was a website that deals in free speech, it was not related to piracy or copyright infringment). I was not prepared to deal with the consequences in this case and thus free speech was denied. I'm not saying NSA was involved in that, because the the information was publically accessible and searchable, but I can see them using a 20 page legal threat from London as a way to intimidate dissident.

Realize that if they want to get someone else in your proximity (family, friends, co-workers), they might use YOUR information even if it's not you who are the real target. The same thing works the other way around. You have friends who are the least hypocrite? Then you are a possible target for blackmailing.

In abolishing it, we would also inevitably abolish many related traditions. It would be a great shame. Although I suppose if you did it minimally; i.e. you just changed the laws of succession to elect a monarch, you could preserve pretty much everything else.

Secondly, if I look back at the elected PMs of my lifetime, none had the humility and decency to sit on the throne, nor can I imagine them doing a better job than Queen Elizabeth. Brown and Major come quite close, but Brown was notoriously bad tempered and Major was cheating on his wife. Thatcher, Blair, Cameron would have been completely unsuited for the role. Politicians are by their nature ambitious and vulnerable to corruption. Monarchs are not necessarily ambitious and are difficult to corrupt. They also often do time in the military, something you rarely see from politicians. How do you bribe someone who has no need for money? What higher position could they lust for? Monarchs still have their flaws, of course - they are far from perfect - but they tend to lack the savagery of our politicians.

Thirdly, a lot of bloodshed and turmoil has brought us to this system. It works very well. There is always an element of the unknown when you overhaul the system, there's always an element of risk. If it ain't bust, don't fix it.

&gt; Libertarianism (Latin: liber, ""free"") is a set of related political philosophies that uphold liberty as the highest political end. This includes emphasis on the primacy of individual liberty, political freedom, and voluntary association. It is the antonym to authoritarianism. Libertarians advocate a society with minimized government or no government at all.

That's exactly the opposite of what the European Left wants.

* The events after WWI when our country didn't even try seriously to defend the territories (I mean those that had significant Hungarian population), that were to be ceded to our newly created (and old) neighboring states. Instead Socialists took power who used pacifist slogans, practically disbanded the remains of the army, and blindly hoped that the ""civilized West"" will make a just peace based on Wilson's principles etc. (Well, they did, just they had drawn the borders so that it was always on the Hungarians' expense). Then the commies took over, proclaimed a ""Soviet Republic"", and they actually tried to put up a fight, but the ""Red Army"" they created crumbled after a few initial successes against the Czechoslovaks, because the officers (and enlisted men too) began to desert it after the commie government gave in to the Entente's demands and withdrew from the territory taken back from the Czechoslovaks (they didn't incorporate it officially but proclaimed a ""Slovak Soviet Republic"" there actually. (After that, the better led and much better armed Romanian army vanquished the already disintegrating Red Army and occupied the whole Hungary, the Commies fled, Admiral Horthy's troops entered Budapest after the Romanians withdrew etc.) So I think the failure was ours, we have primarily ourselves to blame.

* The Jewish laws and the Holocaust in WWII but I think I don't have to elaborate that now.

* The last 20-25 years also, we can't be proud of ourselves for that either. We were regarded the most Westernized former communist country, but now, as they say ""first shall be last"". At least compared to Poland, Czech Rep. and Slovakia we were left far behind.

With that I mean that you are hardly better/worse than the EU, Norwegians etc when it comes to fishing so I don't think it would make a difference at all for the fishes in the oceans whether they get overfished by us, Norway or the Faroe island.  I might add though that I am better at Norway's and Iceland's industries than Faraoe's, and I prefer them both to the EU.    

In some countries, like the US, one mainly uses fishing days.  In some areas, like the EU, it is mainly quotas.  Both ways have their drawbacks and advantages.  Personally I actually prefer a combination.  ",0,1375361983,null,0,false,0,cbeqrtf,t3_1jezkc,t1_cbeqrtf,t1_cbepnlg,null,1429983675,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,DocTomoe,BAWU,Baden-Württemberg,"&gt;  No where does it say that individuals are allowed to have power over others with respects to property rights or the capitalist class system.

Because the perception of power only exists within those who consider themselves propertyless. In reality, someone e.g. owning a house holds no direct power over someone owning nothing, as long as the house-owner does not have an absolute monopoly of renting space (which will never happen in a truly capitalist society). The non-owner (and thus: renter) is free to choose from another landlord, or to move where he can live freer. He is not a slave to the houseowner.

Freedom is the freedom to not have to have contracts with someone - and that applies to both sides.

&gt; dictating power over the weaker in society through wage-slavery

The weaker in society are free to become stronger, though, and noone really *forces* them to work in slave-like contracts. They can choose to get up and demand better working conditions - or decide the work contrat is uneven, and cancel it.

&gt; Also, what about the complete de-regulation of capitalism, that proved to work hasn't it.

Actually, the closest approach to this was the 1880s United States - and indeed, that was the time of the largest increase of wealth to virtually everyone in said territory. Afterwards, there was no real de-regulation anymore, just an ever-shifting body of arbitrary laws and rules to follow.

Of course, de-regulation brought you the internet, four hundred TV channels and cheaper everything (Does anyone still remember when in public phonebooths there was a sign urging people to ""Halte dich kurz"" = ""Don't speak for too long (as it will overuse the telecommunication ressources)""?

&gt; Is capitalism a hierarchical structure?

No. Capitalism in it's truest form actually is a mesh, with different actors giving and exchanging goods and services. There is no ""capitalist dictator"" owning everything, there are freelancers and companies working with each other in manifold combinations and agreements. And there are those who choose freely to sell their working time to a company for a fixed contract and are getting paid for that, always only working for one customer - their employer. 

&gt; Do right Right wingers want power over production?

That has nothing to do with political leanings, and in fact, that's exactly what so-called socialist states immediately demanded after they came into existance. With the difference that they did a lot worse than the capitalist owners... maybe because the state is *one* entity, while capitalists are several, often competing entities.

&gt; Perhaps you should read a bit more instead of just polluting the term, like that other famous group who did this, the National Socialists, who where not socialist besides forcing everyone to work for the war machine.

Well, you took some time before invoking Godwin, but humor me: How is that different from the Soviet policy of ""only he who works should eat"" (See: USSR constitution, 1936)?

Prométhée, pour réparer l’erreur de son frère, alla voler les secrets du feu et des arts à Héphaïstos et Athéna. Pour éviter que les hommes, détenteurs de ces nouveaux pouvoirs, n’en viennent à s’entretuer, Zeus leur accorda aussi à tous les sentiments de la pudeur et de la justice, fondateurs de la conscience politique et de la vie en communauté.

I too use TextSecure, rooted CyanogenMod phone and Debian with full disk encryption. That being said, I also use Facebook. But I have two accounts, both locked down on privacy matters: One slightly disguised name for friends to keep contact, where I have very limited information and do not join groups. Then I  have one other that I access only via Tor and have a dedicated disguised email address associated.

For email, I confess I am guilty of using Gmail. But *anything* even remotely sensitive is PGP encrypted. Even chatting to family members about politics (we all live in various parts of the ""civilised"" West) will almost certainly end up encrypted (at least 2048 bits) before someone clicks to send.

Encryption is like vehicle or health insurance. You might think ""fuck it, I don't need that hassle"", but then you find yourself in a situation that makes you wake up to why you really need it. It could be a minor car crash or hospital visit, but something then jolts you into action.

Encryption is the same. Until we really understand the dangers of letting our personal data float around the Internet in cleartext, it is very difficult to grasp the benefits (protection) encryption offers.

My primary concern is not in fact industrial espionage. I mentioned it because even those who are *not* concerned about individual privacy *should* be concerned about the fact that there are economic repercussions of this whole thing.

About the other points: the EU data retention directive is not really comparable. The usage of that data is, to my knowledge, not by some central (European) agency, but the requirement is that the member states need to retain that kind of information. And in fact, Germany is (or was) rather reluctant to implement that one.

About French, and Swedish espionage: I have to admit that my knowledge about this is rather shallow. I read, in the wake of the NSA disclosures, about large scale French data gathering, but I don't remember reading that they have the capacity to essentially access **all** Internet based communication of foreign countries (like the US seem to be able to). But it's possible I just didn't follow this closely enough -- do you happen to have some article on this?

tl;dr (a) individual privacy is more important than the economic side, to me at least.

true,CreepyOctopus,LATV,Latvia | Sweden,"I am opposed to monarchies, although I do not consider them a major problem.

Modern European monarchies are mostly there for tradition and tourism. Some have a bit more power, some less, but all of them are essentially powerless. So from that point of view, it's okay.

However, I feel that a monarchy, even when it's a constitutional monarchy with a ceremonial King or Queen, is not compatible with the ideals of a free and egalitarian society. The fact that you can't become the head of state, while someone is head of state purely by virtue of both, is inappropriate for a free country. As is the fact that certain people get, by being born in the right family, state benefits which do after all include things like immunity from prosecution. Of course holders of certain offices need the benefits and the protection, but the problem is that the office is inherited and not granted by election or other open method.

Even ceremonially, the monarch is put above the rest of the people, with the people being his/her ""subjects"", etc. Again, I feel that sends absolutely the wrong message.

Some traditions that come with monarchy are great, so is tourism, but it's not like you couldn't preserve most of that. The history isn't going anywhere. if you abolish the monarchy, the museums, palaces and all that are still going to be there.

As for the UK specifically, I really like the Queen and think she's been great. So I'd be even happier if the Brits decided to abolish the monarchy after her death - I think Elizabeth II would be an excellent and very worthy last monarch of the UK, but that is not going to happen.

All that said, I think it's a fairly minor and mostly symbolic issue, there are many things more important both for the individual countries with monarchy, and for Europe as a whole.",0,1375369057,null,0,false,0,cbesyp2,t3_1jhkjd,t1_cbesyp2,t3_1jhkjd,null,1429982653,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

People keep saying this like the United Kingdom isn't a constitutional monarchy with actual power and influence invested in the crown, or that the Queen doesn't have to approve both the resignation and appointment of each Prime Minister *(who she meets with weekly)* or the fact that by protocol, Parliament can't open or absolve without her. Or like she isn't the Head of State who possesses a Royal Veto *(as well as HoS in fifteen other independent countries within the Commonwealth)*....or Head of the Church of England...which has Lord Spirtuals in the House of Lords *(this doesn't mean shit, and is probably her weakest and least influential responsibility, but just wanted to throw it out there to show it's varied)*. 

Or that she appoints influential Governor-Generals to good number of Commonwealth countries *(Canada and Australia most importantly)* and is acting Commander-and-Chief for many of their militaries? 

Yes, this is all ceremonial shit that doesn't matter and as of right now doesn't mean jack shit. You're right. But the power and responsibility is still *there*. You can argue semantics all day, but at the end of the day, *it's still law*. Yeah, the monarchy might not use it, or even be able to use it, now, but who can say what will happen twenty or one hundred years down the road? 

And even if you successfully argue, and atm it's completely true, that it doesn't matter and she can't use it without revolt. *Are you really naive to think that these ceremonial positions and responsibilities, even if ceremonial, don't buy political influence?* She meets with the Prime Minister every week. Foreign leaders and diplomats line up just to get the chance to *meet her*. The Royal Family is deeply entrenched in both British society, religion *(for the few that still practice)* and politics, not to mention the military ties many of them have for having *""done their duty""* in serving. And let's not forget the diplomatic missions that many members of the Royal Family get assigned too. 

You can't just erase hundreds of years of that type of influence, especially when it's *codified into law.* Well you could...but than you'd have to get rid of the monarchy. 

**TL;DR Yes, all the ""official"" positions are ceremonial and don't mean shit. But if you don't think a life-long Head of State position, weekly meetings with Prime Minister and a family that entrenched in every level of British society, religion, political and military circles doesn't have ""political influence"" you're daft as hell.** ",0,1375369506,null,0,1375383107,0,cbet4ej,t3_1jhkjd,t1_cbet4ej,t1_cbepyow,null,1429982580,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The coming century has been dubbed the *""Asian Century""*, and for good reason. While, at present, America and the European Union are the largest economies on the planet, this is due to change with rising Asian juggernauts *(specifically China &amp; India)*. We have the present power, but both those countries have the potential to eclipse us completely and to influence the world in the way they see it. If we still want a voice in the future, a Western influence in global geo-politics, I think something like this is EXTREMELY essential to ensuring that. 

We have the momentum to define the world by Western standards and quality. If we hesitate we'll lose that chance completely. I'd like to bring up this BBC article, [US-EU trade deal: Six reasons to care](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22909209), specifically this part: 

&gt;**4. Chinese standards edged out**

&gt;It will be tricky for the two regions to agree on exactly the same regulations, but the hope is they will harmonise enough to bring huge savings to manufacturers.

&gt;Companies tend to build things that are easier to sell in the biggest market, says Stokes, so a huge market with common technical standards will be a huge draw for global investment.

&gt;""You would be creating a market with no tariff barriers and diminished regulatory barriers, worth about $30tn (£19tn), which would basically set the technical standards for the immediate future.

&gt;""Samsung has made it clear, for example, that its next generation of mobile phones will be built to either a European-American standard, or a Chinese one. And that if Brussels and Washington fail to come up with common specifications, it will be Beijing's standards that Samsung adopts.

&gt;""And perhaps more importantly, these regulations would be openly arrived at, transparent and accountable, unlike those developed by the Chinese government.""

&gt;Car manufacturers in the US and EU have already agreed common standards in things that the average consumer never sees, says Stokes, like the way batteries in electric cars are tested and operate.

&gt;To avoid car companies having to come up with separate electrical vehicles for each market, he says, they want to build cars in Europe they can sell in the US and vice-versa.

===================================================

And this point as well: 

===================================================

&gt;**2. Europe less reliant on Russian gas**

&gt;Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, US natural gas exports are regulated and must be authorised by the Department of Energy, which considers whether exporting is ""consistent with the public interest"".

&gt;However, exports to free-trade-agreement (FTA) partner countries are fast-tracked, so cheap American shale gas would be available to all member countries of the EU, says Bruce Stokes, a non-resident fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

&gt;""That would be in American self-interest and help our trade imbalance but there are US industries who benefit from cheap energy and who probably are not keen to see European competitors benefit from it also.

&gt;""It would also help the European economy and go some way to weaning it off Russian gas. So there are huge geo-strategic reasons for the US to tie its allies to itself through energy exports.

&gt;""Whether you would be able to export enough gas to wean Europe off Russia entirely, it depends, but symbolically it would be very important.""

**TL;DR The EU-US FTA solidifies a Western Bloc, ensures that Western standards and quality are the global status quo (as opposed to China), takes away Europe's reliance on Russia for natural gas (improves energy security) and it seems the only major losers, backed up even by this article, are “BRIC”countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), both of our country/union's potential competitors/rivals in the developing Multi-Polar World of the ""Asian Century"".**",0,1375371068,null,0,1375373050,0,cbetpgs,t3_1jg20q,t1_cbetpgs,t3_1jg20q,null,1429982306,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,kicker7955,ROMA,Romania,"By killing I mean murder(I apologise I wasn't clear) and i mentioned that most people, not everyone subscribes to the idea that it is immoral.

The difference I see is that moral statements are at an individual level, while political principles are amoral ideas that lose dept to be more applicable. Indeed debates like life ""imprisonment vs death sentence"" or ""coercion vs reeducation"" are ethical dilemmas, but this is because they are questions we answer on an individual level. When they become law, their application is amoral.

A person killed his brother, because he was going to humiliate his wife. The specificity of the case allows you to emit a moral judgement. At an administrative level you can't be that specific, so the judgement ""murder is bad and will be punished"" when transcribed into law becomes amoral. He wasn't in self defense, he premeditated a murder, therefor he is guilty.

A more clear example of amorality is taxes, they are a social contract between the citizens and government. The simple answer is that taxes are good, but what if the collectors are misusing the funds or even fund an army that is used against it's own citizens, do taxes  become evil? Of course not, the government is ""evil"" the law is the same, but the context allows us to emit a moral judgement",0,1375372454,null,0,false,0,cbeu8ty,t3_1jfzqc,t1_cbeu8ty,t1_cbepskp,null,1429982055,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; Roma are in most countries known with words related to ""gypsy"" or ""giouftos."" These words come from the word ""Egyptian"" and their use is due to the belief of earlier times that the Roma originated in Egypt. The word ""Roma"" is used in many parts by them and in their language means ""man"" or ""husband."" Among them they more often use the words ""Melele"" (Black People), ""Manous"" (man) and ""Sinte"". Also, the word ""αθίγγανος"" or ""ατσίγγανος"" means the ""untouched"" (from the name of the lowest Hindu caste, from which it is speculated that they originated) and derives from the privative alpha and the verb θιγγάνω ie ""touch"" (modern Greek is ""αγγίζω""). Not to be confused with the religious group Αθίγγανοι who acted in the 8th century in the Byzantine Empire and had great influence.

&gt; Regarding the European area the French word gitan and Spanish gitano originate from the same etymology as the word Gypsy. The German word Zigeuner and Slavic tsigan or cigan seem to have a different source, and are related to the Greek word αθίγγανος, used both to describe the above religious group, but also the ""pagans"" Roma when they first appeared in the territories of the Byzantine Empire. Thus the term predates their appearance. They call themselves Rom with the plural Roma in most dialects. The word Rom is synonymous to Dom, the word used by the Indians for the word ""human."" Even groups such as Sinti who do not call themselves Rom keep the word with the meaning of ""spouse"".

But there are still lots of turks living in germany that barely speak german at all because they never leave their ""ghettos"". -i am not talking about first generation immigrants. Those kids are the second and third generation of turks living in germany. Many of them are still turkish, not german citizens. Third generation immigrants often have massive problems at school because they don't speak german and their parents can't help them with their homework because they can't understand what the kids are supposed to do. Therefore those kids tend to end up with a education that is substantially worse that that of their german peers. They have difficulties finding a job and have a relatively high quota of welfare dependency. That again worsens the chances of their own kids to escape the situation. You see, there is a turkish problem in the german society, that's undenieable and the cause for turks being the number one group that experience racist encounters in germany. In fact there is  a broad majority that somehow have a negative feeling about the number of turks living in germany. That's surely not all racist people. I think that way of thinking comes from some sort of helplessness. Nobody knows what to do about it.

The opposite is actually what should be done, lower everyone's workload and hire more people (an idea too French for the UK, I fear). And even then, it would only be a stop-gap, short-term solution.

With the universal progress of automation, which long ago hit farms and factories and today hits services through computing, the very silly notion that everyone needs a job in the first place is bound to disappear eventually, possibly through a violent uprising. A society can only take so much misery, once enough people go hungry because of rampant (and rising, it can only ever rise from our technological level on) unemployment and benefit cuts, aristocratic heads will find their way into baskets again.

Either that, or society will progressively move towards a form of communism that won't admit what it is, with high taxes on the rich and high benefits for the poor providing most living expenses.

Basically, the seller must open one of these special accounts in that specific bank, and you deposit the money on it (plus the opening fees paid by the seller, of course). 

The bank will allow the seller to withdraw its money only after the successful delivery of the car in US.

As alternative, you can ask the same Italian bank what SWIFT conditional payments messages are accepted in Italy (usually a MT 799 message, used for documentary credits) and ask your bank to issue one of these as a credit transfer to the seller.

I know a teacher that works at a elementary school in an ""ghetto"" area in the town next to mine. She has 16 kids in her 2nd grade class. 2 of them have german parents. The other classes at this school are similar. Whom shall the 14 other kids learn cultural context from? They can chat in their respective languages (which is not encouraged) and see no need to learn proper german. Their parents are no heilp either. The teacher has next to no chance to finish the curriculum because the classes are that slow (not that the kids were dumber than german kinds but they need more explaination etc. than a kid that learned german at home). It's ok to have 2-3 children with such problems in a class but the time that is lost adds up for every single kid that needs special treatment. This results in a curriculum cut that adds up again as the kids advance in further grades. Thus kids that went to schools with higher percentage of foreign kids (with a certain high threshold) have trouble getting a sufficient education.

We have many social advantages and worker rights. Some countries in Europe surely have it better than us, but I don't know about other countries enough to take a guess.

But yeah, there's a minimal amount of obligatory vacation days for workers (and that's not counting the national holidays which are numerous), and we can't get fired very easily. Firing people is almost too much of a hassle for firms (unless the employee committed a grave error, and even then, there must be a discipline counsel and all.. one can't just get fired instantly like in American films). However, taxes are high, and the difference between our pre-taxed salary and our taxed salary is enough to make me dizzy sometimes. 

But yeah, overall, I'd say the worker in France has a generally advantageous situation. But the flipside is that we thus developed internship exploitation, and contracts limited in time, that we call CDD (like, 6 months, after which your contract as an employee ends and the employer doesn't have to hire you again). It's fairly hard for a young person to find a job which isn't like that.

A collectivist semi-classless society with a centrally controlled economy is a pretty damn big intersection of ideals if you ask me.

&gt;The other side has a problem with people because they were born elsewhere or have a differing skin color.

Gross oversimplification, national socialism is considerably more than that. In fact, while racism is an inherent property of the NS mindset, ""Race XYZ is bad"" is not. ""Race XYZ does not belong here"" is an entirely different issue.

&gt; Bullshit.

Oh right, the Antifa likes to talk and discuss differences in ideology, not just go apeshit 90% of the time while clinging to a (supposed) utopia that actively prohibits people with different ideas from speaking their minds. 

&gt; Oh wait, that's what you actually believe.

Mere observation. Got a real argument or is that all?

&gt; what do you know what political ideals they hold?

They like to litter the streets with those neat little pamphlets after they're done with what they call ""protests"", some people actually read those things. Asserting that people sympathetic to the Antifa hold, at the very least, core socialist ideas shouldn't be too controversial, should it? Unless they're all unique little snowflakes.

&gt; Do you have any idea how split in opinions the German leftist scene is?

Opinions on certain issues and the underlying ideology are not the same thing.

&gt; Yea sure, and no Antisemitism and no Racism, no no no, I'm just imagining that.

These things are part of the NS ideology, thats correct. They're also part of the socialist ideology, but the soviet union hunting jews and maoist China hunting people who weren't part of the zhonghua minzu are quickly forgotten (or not known to begin with) by people who think socialism is a peace loving tolerant ideology full of love.

true,InZehInterfector,null,null,"&gt;A collectivist semi-classless society with a centrally controlled economy is a pretty damn big intersection of ideals if you ask me.

If you ask me, that's not correct. But that sounds utterly stupid so I'll expand on my point: There are *of course* the typical communist, anarchist, anarcho-communistic and so on views. But there are also people in (at least my local) Antifa that are simply leftwing democrats that can't take simply sitting around and saying ""Nazis are bad, mhkay?"" as enough a measure against Neo-Nazism in Germany.

&gt;  Gross oversimplification, national socialism is considerably more than that. In fact, while racism is an inherent property of the NS mindset, ""Race XYZ is bad"" is not. ""Race XYZ does not belong here"" is an entirely different issue.

The point *is* the racism, fuck the very *idea* of racism - and by that, every ideology that builds upon that.

&gt; They like to litter the streets with those neat little pamphlets after they're done with what they call ""protests"", some people actually read those things. 

Funny how *every other political party/organization* does the same. If you have a problem with them ""littering"" aka distributing their handouts to people, go ahead a get a law made that forbids people from giving out handouts. 

&gt;Asserting that people sympathetic to the Antifa hold, at the very least, core socialist ideas shouldn't be too controversial, should it? Unless they're all unique little snowflakes.

Depends on what you define as ""socialist"". But I'd say, if you define socialism as the system run in the USSR and PRC and North Korea, no, not even fucking close.

&gt; Opinions on certain issues and the underlying ideology are not the same thing.

See above.

&gt;but the soviet union hunting jews and maoist China hunting people who weren't part of the zhonghua minzu are quickly forgotten 

Not in the least forgotten, fuck that.

&gt;socialism is a peace loving tolerant ideology full of love. 

Mh-mh.

A lot of them feel like they are being treated unfairly by society and they respond by ignoring unwritten and written rules and laws and secluding themselves. What they fail to realize is that they are being treated the same as others who are disruptive. What contributes to the problem is that German citizens and politicians especially are incredibly afraid of seeming xenophobic and therefore back down when Turks play the ""Is it because I am a foreigner"" card.

I like this quote from the last article (through Google Translate):

&gt; Soon, ten years later, the last car just delivered, it was put into service last week. But late carts are the smallest problem. There is a shortage of spare parts, wheel wear is extensive, doors and wheelchair ramps are malfunctioning.

&gt; Willy Nicklasson has nearly ten years been part of the project for the Italian trams, he has been at the factory in Italy dozens of times and was for many years chief engineer at Gothenburg Tramways. He believes that the cause of the problems are largely the attitude of the employees at AnsoldoBreda.

&gt; - It is completely different to work with Swedes or Germans than with the Italians, he says. You have to nag for a couple of years before the Italians realize that a problem is a problem. Only now they begin to understand that we do not like it when things do not work. ",0,1375410916,null,0,false,0,cbf8zx5,t3_1jhtrc,t1_cbf8zx5,t1_cbf0xhz,null,1429974922,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11
