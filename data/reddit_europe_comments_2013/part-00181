true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt; So it turns out this 'special relationship' lasts until we say no, once.

I don't think you get it. Saying ""no"" wasn't the issue. Saying no *after* your PM promises other heads of state that he will involve his nation militarily is the issue. Why didn't Cameron consult Parliment first? This is what I find outraging. He pledged support, then consulted. France and the US were making plans with the assumption that Britain would be involved. The military action that  was going to take place relied on their being a consensus, and that the US wouldn't go it alone. We did not want to do that. We have stayed out succesfully for two years. Then your PM comes along and says not only that would he support military intervention, but also that he would use his own military for support. 

Remember, America was not too thrilled about getting involved either. Cameron, ever since the gas attack, has been all over major news outlets saying he would punish Assad. And then, *after* the promises, he goes to Parliment and gets shot down. That is the issue. You didn't say no. You said yes, and then you said no.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Yeah it kinda does. Chemical weapons don't just kill people, they often only leave them disfigured or disabled. And when they do happen to be lethal the deaths are far more inhumane than conventional weaponry. It's usually a form of prolonged suffocation and a mixture of having side effects. Pupil dilating is usually mentioned because it conjures up an image of what sort of thing is happening to the body of someone when they are the victim of chemical weapons. 

But the way chemical weapons kill isn't the real issue with them. If there was a gun which shot bullets but then killed or disfigured them I wouldn't have such a problem with them. However the real problem with chemical weapons is that they are **amazingly imprecise**. Unless you are attacking a lone military installation in the middle of a huge desert then you are going to be hurting huge numbers of bystanders and the environment. If chemical weapons are used in urbanised areas then it will definitely wipe out the entire enemy force in the area, but you're also going to killed and maim every civilian in the area too. Not to mention that if you use chemical weapons in a rural environment you're going to end up potentially destroying the entire eco-system of animal life and potentially some plant life. This has been seen already with the use chemical weapons in Syria. A number of alleged civilian casualties and chemical weapons have only allegedly been used once. Can you imagine if an entire conflict became chemical? Could you imagine if both sides ended up using chemical weapons against each other? You'd end up with a holocaust of the entire warzone. We're not talking about a few civilians sadly dying due to the war. We're talking about every civilian in the vicinity of each chemical weapons attack. That or they sadly survive and limp on with their maimed bodies. 

This is why chemical weapons are regarded in a similar way to nuclear weapons. Ok chemical weapons probably wont lead to the complete extinction of the human race and life on earth as we know it (though if we advanced chemical weapon technology further, that might be a possibility)  but the kind of damage they could cause if they go unlimited would be immense and not completely incomparable to nuclear weapons. I'd recommend the Wikipedia pages on chemical weapons if you're interested.

*la tenue « jeune » paraît être un meilleur prédicteur du contrôle d’identité,* **sans que l’écart soit significatif**

My counter-claim was: It's more likely that the core reason for the bubble was not that but it was systemic of the financial system. 

So, our difference of opinion is which factor was the more important one. In order to support your claim you said that you know for a fact that Greece did waste a lot of money and that if it didn't then the probability of a bubble would be lower, which is true. 

But that's not the only information we have. We also know that Greece wasting money leading to a bubble coincided with a global financial bubble. 

Your hypothesis is a subset of my hypothesis. I'm claiming that Greece did waste the money because there really wasn't a way to invest them that would not cause the same outcome in the end. So, your data point (Greece did waste money and that led to the bubble) does not really contradict my hypothesis. On the other hand, the data point that I presented (the Greek crisis coincided with other bubbles around the world bursting) is neatly incorporated into my hypothesis, while in yours it's a completely independent event. I posit that a hypothesis that incorporates all the relevant information is more likely to be true than a hypothesis that does not.

To get back to the ""correlation != causation"" thing. Correlation does imply that two events are not independent from each other. It of course does not prove that one event causes the other. But as I said in the beginning, I never claimed that, so it's weird that you mentioned it. Unless you meant that correlation could occur by chance and two independent events just happened together at random. But in that case, my argument above comes into play: a hypothesis that explains all the data is more likely than a hypothesis that ignores one piece of information.

“From numerous interviews with doctors, Ghouta residents, rebel fighters and their families….many believe that certain rebels received chemical weapons via the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, and were responsible for carrying out the (deadly) gas attack,” he writes in the article.

The rebels noted it was a result of an accident caused by rebels mishandling chemical weapons provided to them.

“My son came to me two weeks ago asking what I thought the weapons were that he had been asked to carry,” said Abu Abdel-Moneim, the father of a rebel fighting to unseat Assad, who lives in Ghouta.

As Gavlak reports, Abdel-Moneim said his son and 12 other rebels died in a weapons storage tunnel. The father stated the weapons were provided to rebel forces by a Saudi militant, known as Abu Ayesha, describing them as having a “tube-like structure” while others were like a “huge gas bottle.”

Oggi Natale, a quanto pare si presenti abbastanza benino, certo che il mio dispiacere è di non esservi vicino, ma sicuramente questa giornata il mio pensiero sarà sempre rivolto ai miei cari lontani; speriamo che con il prossimo sia fra noi la Pace che tanto attendiamo, per ritornare alle nostre case. Salutate sempre se siete ancora in relazione con la Iginia e la sua famiglia. A voi non mi rimane che inviarvi i miei più cari saluti e baci per mamma nonna zii e sorelle vostro Aldo.

Dearest (?)ugo with this letter I'm informing you that my health is more than fine, so I hope it is for you and especially for you mom and granma. I now hope to be able to write weekly, so that you can be more at ease, whereas I worry about having no news.  Today's Christmas, it seems not to be too bad, of course I'm troubled by not being close to you, but today my thoughts will always be with my far away family; let's hope that with the next one the Peace we've long waited for might be with us, so that we can come back to our homes. Greet if you're still in contact with them Iginia and her family. For you I can now only send my dearest greetings and kisses for you mom, granma, uncles and sisters your Aldo.

**Basta con mamma e papà**

*«Sui moduli? Secondo genitore»
Venezia, idea della neo delegata ai diritti gay: domande per le scuole, si cambia*

VENEZIA — Addio alla dicitura «mamma» e «papà» dai moduli per l’iscrizione agli asili nido e alle scuole dell’infanzia. Al loro posto comparirà «genitore 1» e «genitore 2». E nei bandi per l’assegnazione delle case popolari di Venezia sarà presto specificato che possono partecipare anche coppie non eterosessuali. È il programma della delegata del sindaco Giorgio Orsoni ai Diritti Civili e alla Politiche contro le discriminazioni, la consigliera comunale Camilla Seibezzi. Lo ha presentato ieri, fresca di nomina. Ma il suo programma scatena subito la polemica, anche all’interno della stessa maggioranza di Ca’ Farsetti. A partire dal primo cittadino, caduto dalle nuvole: «Parte male», dice secco. Camilla Seibezzi, consigliera della lista «In Comune», lavora da anni sui temi dei diritti. E spiega che il linguaggio è un obiettivo fondamentale per contrastare gli stereotipi: «La modulistica costruisce una categoria di pensiero, una prassi quotidiana», dice. Ecco perchè nel suo programma la modifica dei bandi del Comune è tra i primi punti.

Non c’è solo quello nelle linee progettuali della nuova delega, che può contare su uno stanziamento di 40 mila euro per il 2013 e 120 mila nel 2014 e punta ad azioni concrete per valorizzare i diritti civili, con la collaborazione dei vari assessorati e di organismi nazionali e internazionali, come il «Master europeo in Diritti Umani e democratizzazione del Lido» e il Consiglio d’Europa. «Con l’assessorato alle Politiche giovanili lavorerò ai progetti contro omofobia e discriminazioni razziali ed etniche — dichiara Seibezzi —. Insieme all’assessorato all’Istruzione mi occuperò di testi per l’infanzia, in cui la differenza venga presentata come una realtà esistente e di pari dignità. Altri campi d’azione sono l’integrazione di persone affette da disagio mentale, la discriminazione di genere, la mobilità sociale, piaga che affligge l’Italia». Ma sono i primi atti concreti annunciati per moduli e bandi a scatenare subito le proteste a Venezia. In realtà Ca’ Farsetti da oltre un decennio non fa distinzioni tra coppie eterosessuali o omosessuali nell’assegnazione degli alloggi popolari, usando un concetto ampio di «famiglia». E già quest’anno sui moduli di iscrizione scolastici, se gli uffici non avessero ritardato gli atti finali, sarebbero dovute sparire le parole «madre» e «padre» su indicazione dell’ex assessore alla Cittadinanza delle donne, Tiziana Agostini. «La riflessione sulla cancellazione delle ""gerarchie"", prima padre poi madre, ci aveva spinto a prendere la decisione l’anno scorso», conferma Agostini. Un conto però è una decisione presa senza tanta pubblicità, un altro è una scelta politica dichiarata.

Non a caso il primo contrariato è il sindaco: «Non ne sapevo nulla. I delegati prima di lanciare qualche iniziativa ne devono parlare con me». Orsoni però difende la delega: «Lo abbiamo fatto per la tutela dei diritti. Nelle politiche del nostro Comune c’è una particolare attenzione ai diritti di tutti». Meno diplomatico Simone Venturini, capogruppo dell’Udc in Consiglio comunale: «La delega ai diritti civili è un provvedimento personale del sindaco non concertato con la maggioranza, per cui ogni iniziativa verrà valutata o bocciata. Non ci sentiamo vincolati dal patto di maggioranza su questa delega». E aggiunge: «Per noi la famiglia resta formata da uomo e donna, ma questo non vuol dire togliere diritti agli altri. La modifica dell’etichetta non credo dia sostanza ai diritti. Prima risolviamo le emergenze, la lotta di bandiera non è un buon servizio alla città, non cerchiamo punti che ci dividono».

A difendere il programma di Seibezzi è l’assessore alle Politiche Giovanili Gianfranco Bettin. «Sono pienamente d’accordo—dice— nei moduli della scuola dell’infanzia la qualifica di genitore è più che esaustiva per specificare questo tipo di rapporto ». Da Roma Giancarlo Galan, parlamentare Pdl, lancia un affondo a Orsoni: «E’ un’operazione propagandistica, che il sindaco si candidi in Parlamento nazionale se vuole occuparsi di altro rispetto alla politica locale. Mi fa ridere che un sindaco si occupi di discriminazioni razziali o di matrimoni omosessuali».",0,1377904702,null,0,false,0,cbyprh3,t3_1lf4y4,t1_cbyprh3,t1_cbypgnx,null,1429642063,9,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,9

You've got to keep in mind that someone has to pay for all of this. If one of the pupils is really interesting in the Holocaust and of making sure that the lessons learned are not forgotten, they'll probably make their own way there in the future. 

So yeah, it would have been amazing to go and see some other sights in Poland, but it isn't financially feasible or a particularly good use of funds.

Reforms and savings have a popular support: [Yle Survey: Finns are ready for structural reforms](http://yle.fi/uutiset/yle_survey_finns_are_ready_for_structural_reforms/6782661)

Yesterday the governing coalition of six parties from right to left agreed on reforms, savings and budget cuts.

And today the union and employer representatives reached a very moderate labour market settlement which is a crucial part of the efforts: [Wage pact to bring a 20-euro raise for all, followed by one of 0.4%](http://yle.fi/uutiset/wage_pact_to_bring_a_20-euro_raise_for_all_followed_by_one_of_04/6808432)

So pretty much everybody knows what's at stake and are ready to tighten their belts in this boat. There will be no riots or strikes over what is seen as neccessary for Finland's near-mid-long term future. 

So there will be nothing out of ordinary to see, sorry. Just meek old Finns doing their Finnish stuff, that's all.

As an export economy we really have to work on our competitiveness and productivity because the world we are competing with is changing fast and we're losing out there. 

We also have to keep our deficit in check with cuts and savings in public spending. Finland's public debt is approaching 60% of GDP. That may not sound like much, but if the deficit is not kept in check the debt will quickly grow to unsustainable levels with raising interests, and then the decade ahead would look very bleak indeed. And we really need to keep the triple-A credit rating.

Finland also has to attract more foreign investments and those agreements in part address that.

And we also have to keep in mind that Finland's share of the financial help to crisis countries is about €36.4 bn in payments, loans, guarantees and commitments to various mechanisms and as assistance to Iceland, Latvia, Portugal, Ireland, Greece etc. Some of those exposures are really high risk. And as it looks more and more likely that there will be write-offs of some of those loans it will not only cause damage but also threaten the triple-A.

It depends on your schedule, but find a way to make more money. 

As far as expats and reasons for being in Paris, your reason is fairly normal. Other expats...might seem a bit crazy. 

The libraries suck. You will need IDs for each one. Each one has its own rules. Not all of them have wifi.

Learn to love instant coffee. Same thing with cooking amazing dinners with only hot plates and toaster ovens. 

Winter will be longer and wetter than you think. It's just kind of overcast until summer.

The reddit bar guide is just okay. But if you want March Madness (the early afternoon games) then go to The Moose bar.

Running outside is still not crazy popular. But if you do, workout pants are normal.

Find your local, good bakery. Don't buy bread from the grocery store. 

There are a lot of good day trips that are accessible by train and relatively cheap. And then places a bit farther out, such as Lyon that are worth checking out.

Food wise, there is a lot of homogeneity. Younger neighborhoods and newer spots will have more interesting dishes. And going to a place a few times does not make you a regular.

Take advantage of your time, feel free to do some touristy and student things. Drink on the river, etc. Picnic more when it gets nice. Check out the museums and the offbeat ones such as Louis Pasteur (sp?) house. Go to the big farmers market between L'Arc du Triumph and the river. Sp, again. 

Hit up the parks.

Be prepared for people visiting you. Close friends and family will come, often. We usually used Air BnB for a place nearby if it was more than one person. 

Your apt will involve walking up stairs. This is normal. 

Student bars smell, especially during the winter.

The bike rental is worth it. 

If you like movies, there are great old cinemas that play new and old films for relatively cheap prices. Most have monthly or seasonal themes. Show up early and wait in line for a ticket if its an old cinema. You usually don't reserve a seat at these ones.

Save your money, stay on budget and travel around a bit. Nothing crazy but eventually it will feel like a normal city, as in you will want to leave. Plus there are cooler other places. Great hiking. And trains are fun. If you like champagne, GO. There is only one region like it in the world. Pure bucket list. Do it.

Bring any of the simple pharmacy type stuff you want, such as melatonin and q-tips. They will usually lecture and give small doses of stuff. But dentists and everything else are cheap. Skin care wise, French stuff is better.

Edit: learn the schedules of stuff right away. Things shut down on Sundays. Your bakery might close on Saturday. Be prepared and grocery shop on a regular basis. For me it was a bit like New York, where you shop for what you can carry and maybe go 3+ times a week.

How on earth can you not be ashamed over that. You should be.  

You do understand that income tax is just one tax- right? What sort of property tax were you paying in the 70's? Did you have 25% VAT that you actually paid in the 80's? There are thousands of more taxes that you didn't have or didn't pay.

true,ajsdklf9df,null,null,"&gt;Do the Russians have one definition of power? It seems this always means in a military sense.

I would say it has always been in the authoritarian sense. Which is obvious if think about history. Like everyone else it start with Monarchy. Monarchy stays late in Russia and then switches to Communism. And that last almost a century and then we get NOT a working democracy. But mostly chaos, corruption and oligarchy.

So no, Russia does not have a democratic history or tradition of any kind.  And if you look at other very large old world countries, like China, you see they are all almost allergic to the very idea of sharing or distributing power. Something about holding a huge land mass tends to push history towards authoritarian rule.

&gt;They could be a cultural power that attracts attention to its nation in the way American movies, tv shows, and music does. They could be an innovative power, that brings wealth to its people and draws attention to Russian institutions. 

Yes they could. They do have a great cultural tradition in literature, and art, and movies, and math and science, and dance, and so on. However, they can't be that *unless* they have a low corruption, good law and order, quite free and effective economy.

Because you can't be corrupt, and chaotic, and criminal, and be very productive. Crime and corruption are just too poisonous to a society. And this true not just for Russia but *any* country, big or small, suffering from similar levels of corruption and crime.

&gt;It kind of looks like they want to be a religious power, by anchoring itself as the pre-eminent Orthodox church. 

That's just Putin trying to convince everyone his authority is approved by God.

&gt;Russia seems a little clumsy with soft power. 

They are *extremely* clumsy with diplomacy and soft power. And how could they be otherwise? 

During communism their diplomacy was basically telling their satellites what to do, and telling the West to fuck off. While other countries have a rich history of professional diplomacy, communism in Russia wiped the slate clean. A great diplomatic tradition can not just appear out of nowhere. 

&gt;The impression I get is that Russia associates power with two things: Military might, and energy dependency.

Again, that is just the Kremlin and they are leaning on that because that is easy to lean on. 

Actually fighting corruption and creating a productive society and waiting 2 or 3 decades for that to grow into a stable and strong economy, that's about a million times harder than just upping your military spending.

&gt;Russia has a lot of potential to be more than just the guy with the biggest dick in the room that scares everyone else.

And that is the true tragedy of Russia. Russians are some of the kindest people you'll ever meet in person. But as a nation they suffer from an almost paranoia like insecurity. And the people running Russia utterly lack the skills to foster an environment which allow Russia to reach its true potential. 

Russia is too big, and too rich in oil, and has too many nukes, for its own good.

These loans in combination with tighter mortgage rules make it a lot harder to buy a house in the same price category.

Example: Mortgage: €250.000,-, no savings. €50.000/y income. Current market value: €220.000. 
If they sell their house for 220k they will have 30k in debt left, they will have to finance this with a loan of 30k. So this basically means: Max mortgage: €50k * 4,5 = €225.000, the loan reduces this amount with 30k * 3 = €90.000, meaning they would only get a new mortgage of around €135.000.

true,TarantusaurusRex,null,null,"Moving there in January will be interesting. Winter in Paris is **grey**. And rainy. Mostly grey. Super grey. It was really hard for me because I was from the countryside of Ohio, and not accustomed to living in a city where each street was bordered by two grey 6-story buildings and a grey sky. I felt claustrophobic sometimes, and the lack of sunshine got to me. And it gets to everyone else, and you can feel everyone around you become sluggish and brooding in the winter. You're just surrounded by grey people dressed in black, it's... depressing. But when the weather springs back, the whole city gets a breath of fresh air. 

You need to figure out where you want to live, and preferably it's close to your place of employment, although that may not be best, depending. For instance, if you're working in the 6th or 7th arrondissements, you will have one hell of a time finding affordable housing. If you're working in la Défense, you don't want to live way out there. But the métro system is great, and you don't necessarily have to live down the street from your work place, but you don't want to have to switch lines 3 times just to get there. 

I personally recommend the 10th, 11th, 19th, and 20th arrondissements. That is simply my favorite part of Paris, it is cheaper (but all of Paris is expensive), there are less tourists (except at Cimètière Père Lachaise maybe), tons of great cafés and bars, restaurants, and it has a lot of character. You're close to things like Parc des Buttes Chaumont, métro hub République, the bar strip of rue Saint-Maur, Gare de l'Est and Gare du Nord, super delicious and cheap Asian restaurants and shops in Belleville, Canal Saint Martin, and more. I lived in the 10th and 11th arrondissements at métro Chateau d'Eau and métro Goncourt. I am a petite woman and I walked home from bars at all hours of the night or morning on quite a few occasions, but I never ran into any trouble. That doesn't mean it's a harassment-free neighborhood, Paris is a big city and anything can happen, it's important to be careful. I wouldn't whip out my iPhone while walking late at night, for instance. Instead, I always carried around my favorite little map book. Granted, if I got lost and had to use a map, I looked like a freaking tourist, but it's better than using an eye-catching, glowing money machine.

Oh, speaking of getting lost, you're gonna get lost. [This is the greatest mapguide ever made.](http://www.amazon.com/The-Paris-Mapguide-Michael-Middleditch/dp/0141469048/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377936559&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+paris+mapguide) I have never, ever seen a better mapguide. I bought one the first time I visited Paris, and it was so freaking awesomely wonderful that I bought another one before I moved there. It's small, super thin, much more inconspicuous than a big, cumbersome fold-able paper map, doesn't fall apart with time, and is super easy to read and navigate. It has every site of importance in it. I can't even count how many awesome little gems I discovered just by looking at this map book. Sometimes when I was bored, I would take a FriXion erasable pen, draw out a zig-zag path to walk through the streets of a random neighborhood, and that would be my day.  I would send you mine, but it has a ton of notes and stuff in it, and it's very special to me. It is sort of like my journal of experiences and favorite places in Paris. After some time, you won't need it on a daily basis, and you'll find yourself traversing familiar streets without hesitation, but it's super handy and I used it til I moved away, albeit sparingly.

The whole shopping experience is totally different. There is no big department store that has absolutely everything like Walmart or Target in America. Except BHV, I guess. But BHV is expensive and you can find anything you need for a cheaper price in other shops, and BHV is on rue de Rivoli, so going there can be utterly frustrating depending on tourist season.  

If you have difficulty making friends because of your poor French skills, SEEK OUT social groups that speak English. Book clubs, theatre classes, cooking classes, go to polyglots, couchsurfing meetups, Reddit meetups, go to events at Shakespeare &amp; Co. or Abbey Bookshop, whatever. Just make friends and have a support system, because culture shock can be hard. It is not necessarily recommended to make English-speaking friends because it can hinder your ability to learn French, but you need friends, and if you don't speak French, then you can't connect with people who don't speak English, and having friends, going out, that's going to make your life 100% better and it will really ease the transition. I did not have friends for a long time, and I was really depressed. Making muffins and having a spur-of-the-moment Reddit meet-up was the best thing I ever did in Paris, and I wish I'd done it sooner.

That's all I've got for now. Enjoy that wall of text.

These countries being in the Euro made things worse though: The easy way of devaluating their currency is no longer available, and the forced austerity may well be the mistake that destroyed Europe as we know it.

Collect used but usable school materials from people, or offices or companies.

Discuss and pressure schools to reduce materials strictly necessary.

All the way down in the 15th, eh? If I were you, I'd try to score a flat near one of the hubs where line 8 runs (Balard to Créteil-Préfecture), since it is the main line in the 15th. So... République, Bastille, or Opéra. I was really thankful to be living around République, because it was nearly a straight-shot to anywhere in the city. Goncourt was not a hub, but it was a direct line to République, and they are within walking distance of one another, so I could choose to walk or ride depending on my mood or the weather. 

Lucky for me, I did not need to go apartment shopping. I obtained a visa by finding work as an au pair (underpaid foreign nanny), and the family with whom I worked provided me with a small studio apartment. I am not the person to talk to concerning finding an apartment in Paris, I have no experience in that subject matter. All I can recommend is searching for ""locations"" (apartments for rent) on [leboncoin](http://www.leboncoin.fr). I'm not sure how difficult it would be for you to obtain an apartment that way, however. As far as I know, foreigners always have a difficult time securing an apartment without the assistance of an agency or by knowing-someone-who-knows-someone, and agencies are costly.

If you raid the public building you are damaging your own property and the government doesn't care about the public services. You need to raid something that matters for the elite like a profitable business.

&gt; What if it was your business? Seriously question, what did the supermarket do wrong to those people they deserve to be robbed?

If It was my business I would be more concerned about the broken social peace and the PR problems that the situation can generate if I go to court than about €2,000 in school material. Furthermore, [Carrefour had a profit of 902 millions of Euros](http://es.noticias.yahoo.com/carrefour-logra-beneficio-semestral-902-millones-euros-073720308.html).

However, government has sent  the police, because  they have a confrontation with the union that is connected with IU(United Left). Do you remember when they tried to farm public land in Las Turquillas?

When I was in school we could ask for those things to neighbours, to the school, family, hell, my school back then gave books to the ones who needed it for free (though the had to return them when it all ended and they had to be in good condition of course).

There are better ways to do these things, for example, my family have been related to public schools so when one of them was about to close because there were no money and not every class was filled with 30 kids. Everyone, students, teachers and parents just close themselves in the building. It worked. About ten years later is still open and working, and I had the chance to study two years there.

*Luftschlag* ist unschwer als Übersetzung des englischen *air strike* zu erkennen.  Über das Phänomen der Übersetzbarkeit von Sprache in der verwalteten Welt, insbesondere beim Militär, hat Karl Korn ein gleichnamiges Buch geschrieben.

&gt; Klingt dementsprechend ungefährlich, umschreibt aber das massenhafte Abwerfen von Bomben und Marschflugkörpern Raketen auf ganze Länder und damit den Tod vieler Menschen. 

Auch das ist falsch: massenhaftes Abwerfen von Bomben wäre ein Flächenbombardement (engl. *area bombing*), wohingegen Luftschläge Abwürfe von meist einer einzigen Bombe bzw. Rakete pro zu zerstörendem Ziel bedeuten.

&gt; Um das noch weiter zu verschleiern, ist es durchaus üblich, die Attacke als begrenzten, gezielten oder gar chirurgischen L. zu bezeichnen und so zu suggerieren, dabei könne nicht das Geringste daneben gehen.

Der Begriff *chirurgisch* als Übersetzung des engl. *surgical* ist ein Fachterminus, der die Art der bei einem Angriff verwendeten Munition (präzisionsgelenkt im Gegensatz zu ungelenkt) hervorhebt.

Offenbar hält man es in der friedensbewegten Linken nicht einmal mehr für nötig, sich mit der Materie des Krieges, gegen den man ständig kämpft, auseinander zu setzen.

I am under the assumption that you mean before taxes here - that would be accurate. Take into account that 1) you're losing around 50% of that due to taxes and 2) the position they'll be offering you will be most likely temporary (renewed every X months, depending on your contract, no sick leave, no paid vacation).

Having a masters will not guarantee you a better treatment by itself - that all depends on the amount of cred you managed to build up during your intership. If you haven't impressed them much, and you're not planning on playing hardball when the time comes, I'd say you'll be looking at around 1.2k€ a month after taxes. It might be more than that but by not by a lot, the ceiling being definitely lower than 2k a month after taxes.

Now, that might or might not be a decent salary depending where you're going to live - if it's in the south, 1200 a month would still be a bit tight, but manageable. In Milan, rent for a 1 bedroom in the outskirts is going to set you back around 600-800€ a month alone, so it's going to be tight even with 2k - probably unmanageable with less than 1500. And remember - no sick leave, no paid vacation, and they can basically let you go when they feel like to.

During negotiations, first step would be to find out what kind of contract they're offering. ""Tempo indeterminato"" (permanent position) and ""Tempo determinato"" (temporary position) might look similar from a foreigner's point of view, but they're worlds apart. As said already, they'll probably offer you a ""Tempo determinato"" position but if they don't and offer you a ""Tempo indeterminato""  instead, you'll have to factor in all the additional benefits/safety nets that it implies when considering the raw monetary offer - I would say that a 1200 eur a month after taxes permanent position looks way better than a temporary 1800 a month.

The scandale about the US performing surveillence on some european countries is not that the US doens't consider them allies, just that it does not trust them nearly as much as it trusts the UK. 

Would they really leave all surveillence over to the Spanish for example with no backup plan? They don't trust the Spanish, the French, the Germans or the Italians enough to entrust all european security and intelligence to their native countries. Europe and the US are in close contact and therefore it is important for the US to have intelligence in what goes on in europe and it doesn't trust European governments to be capable of doing so with the exception of the UK (though I'm sure Britian gets a share of surveillence no doubt).

TL:DR

As heinous as chemical weapons might be it takes but two words to lose the moral high ground: Agent Orange being one set of two words,   Depleted Uranium being another.  DU is particularly insidious in that it is cumulative.  It builds up in the body over time leading to tumours, sterilisation or birth defects that goes through generations.    

One does not excuse the other, chemical, biological or depleted nuclear material.  It simply raises questions about the level of sincerity.  One might even argue that cluster munitions deserve to be in the same category and have a longer lasting impact on the civilian population.  If you're caught cold in a cloud of Sarin you run the risk of asphyxiating on your own vomit.  If you live in area that has been shelled with DU and survived your soil and surface watertable is a hotbed of tumours, genetic destruction, birth defects and sterilisation.  With clustermunitions it's just a lot of PTSD and a generation of children with missing limbs.  If anything the DU and clustermunitions are more long term ethnic cleansing.
 
The really important aspect however is the precedent it sets.  Not that one side has used them, but that if a thousand or so people are killed by them, then they can summon a superpower and its intervention.  If rebels are losing it only takes one faction to weigh up how much they stand to lose and how much they stand to gain if they sacrifice a rival rebel faction aligned village.  The UN's spoken about the rebels having access to such material - without even going into who the rebels might actually be and what some of them might represent.  What happens if chemical weapons are used again?  Is it more escalation, or do you even the battlefield out and drag the civil war out even longer causing more harm, or do you hold you hands up - admit that you tried but it didn't work - and send a completely different sort of message out?

A simple premise of the Hippocratic Oath is do no harm.  It's obviously much more difficult when considering military action but in this case it's difficult to see what military action, however limited, is going to do any good.

If they can come up with a tactic that would address the problem and change things for the better, then great.  Let's hear it.  But a short sharp strike is going to achieve nothing.

All I said were the reasons for chemical weapons being treated the way they are treated. I didn't even mention many other forms of weaponry apart from nuclear and 'conventional' weapons which, when I use the word, means rifles, machine guns, pistols and other such weapons which make use of gun powder and metal missiles. I would put explosives such as missiles, bombs and fragmentation grenades under a different category. So I didn't even really compare chemical weapons to cluster bombs or any other incredibly destructive or imprecise form of warfare apart from nuclear.

But I will elaborate some on it here. I think that in an ideal world there are no lethal weapons which are designed and used exclusively for the killing of other human beings. This includes chemical weapons, fragmentation grenades, bombs, mines, missiles, machines guns. There are certain acceptions for some conventional weapons if they serve an alternative use to killing human beings. Examples could be killing animals (either for protection or food). Euthanasia would be allowed but not executions.

So ideally I'd like the entire world to disarm, but I know this is not going to happen in the near future so I would at least appreciate that we stop furthering the development and usage of newer weapons such as nuclear and chemical weapons, but also cluster bombs and forms of biological warfare. I would hope that all of these move backwards instead of forwards and at the very least come to a stand still in terms of their proliferation, development and usage. 

The West is not immune from this. I never said that Western forces or any other forces should go and start bombing Syria. I don't know how it is best to ensure that the advancement of chemical weapons in Syria is halted. I don't pretend to know the answer. I just know that they should be halted but not how. I am indifferent in terms of whether the West should intervene or not because I do not know what outcome will happen whether we intervene or not. So I do not push for either side. The person I was responding to simply asked ""Are chemical weapons really that important"" to which I replied ""yes they are"". Lots of other weapons are important, though personally I think chemical weapons do trump most of them. However I also think that they should all be reduced (clusters bombs, drone strike capabilities, the lot).

I hope this clears up my opinions and reasons for commenting somewhat for you as I rather feel that you misinterpreted my opinion. Just because what I am saying appears to be supporting a political stand point does not mean *I* support that stand point. I am merely providing information. I was not arguing a corner and you'd be best advise to remember that in future. ",0,1377960763,null,0,false,0,cbz1dug,t3_1ledx9,t1_cbz1dug,t1_cbz0jss,null,1429636627,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;Im Dezember 1963 streute der KGB Gerüchte, dass der Öltycoon H. L. Hunt hinter der Ermordung des Präsidenten John F. Kennedy im Monat davor gesteckt habe. Dieser soll mit zwei befreundeten rassistischen Unternehmern den Anschlag geplant und finanziert haben und über Jack Ruby den eigentlichen Attentäter Lee Harvey Oswald engagiert haben. 

&gt;Sowjetische Medien behaupteten, über einen polnischen Informanten davon erfahren zu haben. Hunt war in den Jahren vor dem Anschlag in der amerikanischen Öffentlichkeit immer wieder durch harte Statements aufgefallen, weshalb dieser Theorie teilweise Glauben geschenkt wurde.

&gt;Eine gegen die liberale kanadische Regierung gerichtete aktive Maßnahme löste 1966 die Munsinger-Affäre aus, die das kanadische Parlament über Wochen paralysierte.

&gt;Während des Vietnamkrieges benutzte der KGB das von ihm verdeckt finanzierte World Peace Council in Helsinki, um das Bild der Weltöffentlichkeit in seinem Sinne gegen die USA zu wenden.

&gt;Im Jahr 1984 versuchte der KGB durch eine weltweite aktive Maßnahme den amerikanischen Präsidenten Ronald Reagan zu diskreditieren, um so seine Wiederwahl zu verhindern, was jedoch scheiterte.

&gt;Im Zuge der Machtkämpfe in Polen in den 1980er Jahren zwischen Kommunisten und der Reformbewegung versuchte der KGB im Jahr 1985 den damaligen Papst Johannes Paul II. zu diskreditieren.

&gt;Im Jahr 1987 lancierte der KGB einen gefälschten Brief des damaligen CIA-Chefs William Casey, um den indischen Premierminister Rajiv Gandhi zu diskreditieren.

In Northern Italy, average starting salary for an engineer is between 24k and 28k (if he's lucky enough to find a job..). Without knowing how much experience you have, it's impossible to say if they are underpaying you. If this is an entry-level position, and not in a major city, I would say it's fair.

The kind of contract also plays an important role.

*Recurring operating income in the zone (Europe outside of France) amounted to EUR509m, a decrease of 20.6%, largely explained by the economic context in Spain and Italy. In Spain, investment in prices was not fully compensated by the significant reduction in SG&amp;A.*

Even if this wasn't the case, I don't see why it should matter. Carrefour isn't an NGO: if people steal school supplies, they'll simply stop stocking school supplies. And if people keep stealing in that hypermarket, they'll just close altogether: Carrefour has plenty of other stores in Spain and elsewhere. Their shareholders aren't in this for losing money, and the management has to respond to those shareholders.

Do you realise that I never said you did, or even mentioned the words 'invasion' or 'invade'?   

I wasn't even having a personal go at you.

I wasn't trying to purposely pull apart what you'd said which is why I withheld from pointing out that when you say chemical weapons don't just kill people but leave survivors disfigured or disabled, that all manner of conventional weapons outside Hollywood do that.  I also held back when you seemed to talk about chemical weapons more in terms of what might be considered biological with potentially threatening life globally.

I know you didn't compare cluster weapons to chemical weapons, that's the argument that I made.  Cluster munitions affect an area for much longer than chemical, and DU is far longer lasting contaminant.

&gt;But I will elaborate some on it here. I think that in an ideal world there are no lethal weapons which are designed and used exclusively for the killing of other human beings.

Other than not going to happen (although I appreciate you say in an ideal situation), non lethal ballistics often carry a greater collateral risk.  If you have a low energy round, you risk tumbling which makes for a far messier wound for anyone it hits and less accuracy.  If you go for a high velcoity-low energy transfer round then it is less likely to stray from the target, but it's also less likely to be stopped by it, so anything in an arc behind it is also at risk.  Humane or non-lethal weapons often have counter intuitive results, even leading to more violence.

&gt;I rather feel that you misinterpreted my opinion. 

I think you've taken my comment far too personally.  I merely added to your comment that whilst there's a hullabaloo forming around chemical weapons it's not that much different to what was done in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and even to a lesser extent the Drug War in South America.  

That they're using it as a rallying point towards enabling action (not you) and they're using gas as an extremely emotive enabler.  I deplore its use, but its faux-condemnation from those players that use both cluster munitions and depleted Uranium and it deserves to be put in that context.

true,kicker7955,ROMA,Romania,"and positive money seems to be left wing idealism without substance and pragmatical solutions:

- ""Liability money"" is restricted in most countries by banking legislation, banks have to guarantee most of their crediting with deposits(central reserves) to the national bank, the problem lies in the British government letting the banks have only 3% of their liability covered by actual money, not with the system(in this case)

1. so working with central issued liabilities that are unsupervised is somehow better than working with private liabilities. Spreading of ""the wealth"" on a number of private banks means that they can theoretically fail and the economy will survive(if this doesn't happen is the government fault and should be addressed as that). Also private banks are motivated by profit and this, in the commercial sector is a good thing, it creates a higher cost for risky(or ineffective) investments and rewards safe stable investment(I said commercial not financial sector, there the profit rates and the possibility of covering risk makes the situation basically reversed, you're a fool if you invest in low yielding stocks, ). 

2. He very well stated that the committee should be protected from lobbyists and government but should be fully transparent and under parliamentary scrutiny! How does that work? If the government will have a monopoly in crediting business and citizens I assure you they will not be reluctant in doing so, the main cause of the 3% coverage rate is because the government wanted perpetual high growth(again the problem is administrative) and did not care about the risk(or at best, they pushed the risk on to the next guy in office). 

3. this is basically what happens in non-Keynesian economies, Germany is the perfect example, but most of Europe works the same way and the mechanism is the central bank's interest rate. Again the mechanism exists and works well(there are some technical problems but that is another story and is more a question of philosophy) under the current system, when you don't have greedy politicians and bankers at the economical dashboard.
+ the inflationary effect is not only related to money mass it is also psychological(Japan, Germany), the expectancy of growth generates a natural inflation rate as people tend to spend more even when the economy actually stagnates for a long period of time, witch in turn actually makes them poorer.

4. Well this point is WTF?...so he is arguing the state create money (a lot of it) to pays the present debt, and somehow this wont create a excess in the economy and generate inflation that he argued against in the previous point. 

5. Valid point, but the housing sector is part of the real economy (the liability part is when you create a artificial rise in housing costs because of increased demand in a inflationary sector), however, this can be done in the current system if politicians would learn to say ""NO, this is how we're doing things from now on.""

6. I don't care anymore, I'm to depressed

What a pathetic excuse for a economy theory, I don't know what angers me more, the fact that he makes money selling books with this story telling or that there are actual rational people that take him serious and move away from true progressive and pragmatical solutions.

***TL;DR** I find the theory lacking any practical substance, also I apologise for the rant but this really presses my buttons, I feel like the doctor that watched a seventeen century ""healing"" ceremony*

The second scheme it's the same path but departing from Manciana and going back to Grosseto.

Actually according to this it looks like there's only ONE daily stop in saturnia, also the two hammers means it's a work-days service only and looking at the timings it seems a bus for commuters.

Example: You take the bus in Grosseto at 13.15 and you arrive at Saturnia Terme at 14.54
Way back: Pick up the bus at 6.03 AM to arrive in grosseto at 7.40

so... you really have to get a car! :)


EDIT: Just a small correction, looks like there are 7 buses doing this itinerary departing from Grosseto Station, but only #1932 goes to Saturnia, the hammers means it operates on workdays (Monday to Friday) and the little number 1 means (according to the tiny notes on the bottom of the timetable) it's available from 24/6 to 25/8 so according to this timetable after the 25th of august there's no bus service from Grosseto to Saturnia.

Departing from Manciano it seems the service is available all year long, bus #1940 still has the hammers logo but no small #1. This makes me believe this is a commutes bus for people of the countryside that has to reach Grosseto for their jobs.

Sooo... if you still want to try getting there by bus, you have to reach Manciano very EARLY, and get the 7.10 bus to Saturnia, but a mistery remains... how to get back after the 25th August? This my friend Is something we'll never know!

Vous peignez ce tableau en noir et blanc, entre d'un côté un Etat souverain et de l'autre une insurrection islamique, ce qui n'est vraiment pas la réalité.

Comme toujours au Proche-Orient, la situation implique une multitude d'identités différentes entre musulman/chrétien, arabe/kurde sunnite/chiite, majorité/minorités et d'autant plus de combinaisons communautaires possibles. Lorsque la révolution s'est déclenchée en Syrie, c'était dans le cadre du printemps arabe et si forcément Dieu était présent aux côtés de certain manifestants, ce n'était pas la revendication principale. A mesure que la guerre civile s'est entérinée, elle a tendu à radicaliser les positions. Mais il faut savoir que, que ce soit parmi les loyalistes ou parmi les insurgés, il existe vraiment une variété de profils. Les combats se déroulent essentiellement entre des milices des deux côtés, parfois organisées spontanément. Parmi les loyalistes, on retrouvera entre autre ces minorités dont le régime d'Al Assad garantissait une tranquillité. Parmi les insurgés, des islamistes, mais pas que. 

Pourquoi intervenir maintenant et pas il y a un an ? Non pas pour des raisons économiques comme l'immonde et illégale guerre en Irak, mais pour des intérêts géostratégiques. Si les Etats-Unis sortent enfin de leur posture d'observateur distant, c'est parce que justement parmi les mouvement d'opposition syrienne s'impose de plus en plus la mouvance islamique du côté des insurgés et parmi les loyalistes l'influence iranienne. Ce double objectif est paradoxal: il consiste d'un côté à vouloir l'écroulement du régime sans qu'il ne tombe dans les mains iraniennes et de l'autre à chercher à ce que ce ne soient pas les jihadistes qui réussissent à se mettre en place comme gouvernement (car alors hostiles aux Etats-Unis).

&gt; Do you think that Carrefour will be concerned about the increasing social unrest in Spain?

Maybe. But in that case it is far more likely that the group's management will close up shop in Spain and concentrate on growing, lucrative markets than lose any sleep over this country. They just sold Dia, you know...

Learning languages (even if there are times where I can only give them a handful of hours a week) is for me one way to feel a constant self-improvement at something worthy.

Knowing Spanish, Catalan and English, French seemed like the next logical step to take (as it has a lot in common with the three of them), and as I learned it I started to enjoy it more and more; right now I am somewhere between A2 and B1.

I started with German recently (at the point I am in French there is no interference anymore), with the intention of opening doors for myself for when I go abroad to work, but I am realising that I also like it a lot as a language.

About the Finnish, I took some courses the year I spent in Helsinki, and got to learn the basic grammar; my impression was that it's the kind of language which is difficult at first (at least for people coming from Indoeuropean branches), but it doesn't have a lot of exceptions so once you are familiar with the rules it's nice and downhill from there; I want to come back to it sometime in the future, if I can, although I don't know when that will be.",0,1377971190,null,0,false,0,cbz4cnq,t3_1lgdfq,t1_cbz4cnq,t1_cbz3gx5,null,1429635230,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

&gt; Spreading of ""the wealth"" on a number of private banks means that they can theoretically fail and the economy will survive(if this doesn't happen is the government fault and should be addressed as that)

For example, you mention that the profit motive is a really good incentive for a distributed investment allocators (the private banks) although even the [Chairman of the Financial Services Authority in the UK has argued that something is wrong with the way the bank executives are incentivised within the current framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=iOEUd54NN4Q#t=958). I think the point you're missing is that banks, by creating money and allocating capital, play the role of regulators of the economy. Don't you think a regulatory role like this should be taken out of the market economy and turned into a public utility? Otherwise, you have conflicting interests as banks try to maximise their profits as businesses which does not necessarily coincide with their intended role, which is capital allocation. 

&gt;  If the government will have a monopoly in crediting business and citizens I assure you they will not be reluctant in doing so

Well, this is an institutional, technical issue. Are you going to argue that it is impossible to have a publicly-controlled institution (or number of institutions if you want a distributed solution) that is responsible for printing money but will not tend to print too much? 

&gt; this is basically what happens in non-Keynesian economies, 

What the hell is a ""non-Keynesian economy""? 

&gt; the mechanism exists and works well [...] when you don't have greedy politicians and bankers at the economical dashboard

A system which promotes individuals looking out for their ""rational self-interest"" does not work well when individuals fulfil that expectation and are greedy. You call this a well-functioning system?

&gt; the inflationary effect is not only related to money mass it is also psychological(Japan, Germany), the expectancy of growth generates a natural inflation rate as people tend to spend more even when the economy actually stagnates for a long period of time, witch in turn actually makes them poorer.

You are referring to that economic theory that any amount of printing will cause inflation that will immediately nullify any advantage, right?

Internal demand is in general subsidised by the state in these cases, and so almost all manufacturers stop exporting because they want to have bigger margins. But (unless the state intervenes) imports continue and this not only creates external debt but also ruins the exchange ratio as importers buy up all the foreign currency and try to sell excess national currency; this blows up your exchange ratio (unless the state intervenes again) which causes all imports to become more expensive and national debt grows exponentially.

I'm in a similar position in that I'm living in Spain for a year, but I've been here two months already.

I've found that people originally from Latin America and North Africa don't seem as bothered when I smile or start talking about something. Gypsies also seem to be more friendly in what I think of as the ""American"" way and down to smile and chat about nothing in particular for no good reason. It's kind of sad, because I was hoping to get to know some Spaniards while I was here, but it seems like the way we make friends, meet new people, and interact socially is just way too different to overcome without a lot of effort.

I know some of this is irrelevant to your question, but since you just moved here, maybe you'll find some of it informative.

Turns out (as far as I can tell) the social rules here are pretty similar to Germany/Central Europe, which I know all too well: Don't look at people unless you need to interact with them, don't smile unless you have a good reason to, don't talk to strangers unless you need to, etc. Funny because I moved here from Latin America and for some reason thought Spain would be a bit more like its former colonies than the other parts of Europe I'd lived in, but in this particular way I've found that it's not.

true,badlyjester,null,null,"&gt; You have to look at it from that perspective: You only go to the doctor if you're sick, so just because the health care is free there should be more people getting sick?

While this is generally true, there are some exceptions. Just as an example, several GPs have told me that it's quite common for (lonely) old people to go to the doctor regularly as some kind of social call. In itself, not a biggie, and hey, if it makes the old folks feel a little better...

The thing is, cost in healthcare isn't transparent at all, unless you're privately insured. People don't know what kind of costs are associated with their trips to the doctor. Why don't GKV patients get a bill too, to see what their insurance is covering exactly?

&gt;but that might very well also be because Germany currently has to less physicians.

That's a very common misconception. There's shitloads of doctors, almost too many of them in certain places. The problem is rather that young doctors, if they even choose to become GPs, don't feel like moving out to the boonies to set up shop. And that *is* a problem of our current system. Can you guess how much a GP makes per patient/quarter? About 35€ (depending on the region). That's regardless of whether the patient shows up once or 25 times. Ever wonder why so many GPs are on ""vacation"" towards the end of a quarter?

You haven't bothered to change your economy because it didn't suit you, but you are not taking responsibility for any of it. 

I never said you were lazy- you said that. I said that you had a low productivity which is different, but you do not seem to care. 

I am not surprised you are not taking responsibility for your country or blaming everything on someone else. If there is one thing that seems to unite all Greeks is that is someone else's fault.  All Greeks are hardworking and none corrupt and pay their taxes apparently. The fact that a country can't fall to the depths of the corruption without large parts of the population agreeing, is again, something you refuse to acknowledge. 

I find the messages meaningless too. It is all the usually stories about how hard you had it during history and that no one is corrupt, all pay taxes, apart from very few. Not true of course, if one look at statistics, but never mind.  And it will continue in Greece. Nothing will be fixed until you start taking responsibility. I have little hope that you will though, you will just continue to blame other people, situations, history- whatever you can come up with as long as it is not the Greeks.

Since we seem to agree that the ""macroeconomic guru"" was full of fairy tales let me present my main point and then respond to your points. 

I do not think this is a good(stable in the long term) and efficient system(of distribution of money trough the economy), but it can work, if proper supervision and legislation is adopted. This I find to be a more realistic and obtainable goal, that enforcing an economic Y2K.

I did mention that the profit incentives work for commercial activities not capital management. I agree that the banks control the flow of capital, and this is a problem, but having no filters, only a political-administrative entity is not a solution either. Using our current framework, defining the ways capital can be used and letting financial operators fail(this makes the banks stock owners limit the risk they will tolerate from their CEO's in the future) is a far better and more tangible solution.

I am arguing direct political influence over an economical tool will do exponentially more damage than simple greed, for better or worst bankers know and work with the system; their abuse is applied in such a way that they can reap benefits even in 5-10 years from now, politicians have neither the expertise nor the self-control to think long-term. Can you see a politician saying to his electorate: we will keep interest rates high because it is a difficult economical climate and be reelected? Look at the germans, despite their rational and long term thinking, they are angry with the stagnation of their economy despite it being the most structurally solid in the world. Imagine a politician running for office that has the power to improve the economy over night.

My apology, I took some liberties when I said non-Keynesian, but the fact is the last 40 years of growth in the UK and the US(to a lesser degree, their economy has other engines) has been based on overcapitalization of companies, national investments and preferential corporate legislation. And because of this, I define them as pure Keynesian economies. A non Keynesian economy is one, in witch banking is restricted to commercial activities and investment banking are mostly separated. Highly leveraged transactions are prohibited, anti-trust laws work, and in general the bulk of GDP comes from the ""real"" economy. And monetary mass is controlled and limited by central banks.

The framework works well in most western economies(this recession only affected solid economies by proxy), people following their self interest is a good way of maximising productivity, having good laws and applying them to limit risk makes for a safer system than bureaucrats that will still follow their self interest, but this time they won't be under the supervision of somebody that can act quickly to stop their abuse. 

Actually no, that is the premise of basic inflation, I was referring to a backhand consequence of the [price/wage spiral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price/wage_spiral). In a stagnant economy worker's expectations grow, this causes increased spending which lowers their effective real income this is equivalent to the effect of inflation.

Similarly, when your eyes meet with other people's on public transport, the usual procedure is to just drive it elsewhere without staying locked, with an affable smile at most.

Giving American-like smiles everywhere is not impolite, but it is unusual and people tend to distrust unusual things. That said, people are usually really open, and if you meet them in the right context it's easy to break the distance.

I hope that I didn't give the wrong impression, I am genuinely curious about what you think about English grammar, it's something that it's helpful to have an outsider's perspective on to understand it because as a native speaker you're just a fish unable to see the water.

From what I've heard a lot of English's inconsistent spelling come from pronunciation changes (the Great Vowel Shift) that came after the rough standardisation of spellings in the 15th-16th centuries. I'm not sure why English was unable to update spellings in the way that other languages have been able to, but it's interesting to think how the political characteristics of nations might play into the development of languages.

I think the rhythmic nature of English and how that leads to unstressed and reduced vowel sounds also makes the spelling seem poor too. And the language bears the scars of centuries of slightly misinformed meddlers due to the lack of updated spellings; hence 'island'.

I would also say that 'd' doesn't replace 'th' because they're different sounds, no matter how much second language speakers might try and convince the world differently :P

Interestingly ([and by 'interestingly'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f68VXKMZT1Q)) although English doesn't have a polite way of addressing people 'you' does derive from the formal way of addressing people.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"This map represents linguistic *descent*. In the first few generations of Dutch settlement on the Cape, Dutch was the language spoken by the ""Dutch"" settlers there. But as centuries passed, linguistic changes took place, and the language spoken by ""Dutch"" Afrikaaners could be considered a language distinct from Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands. What separates Afrikaans from Dutch are linguistic changes, both in Africa and in Europe, that make Afrikaans sufficiently distinct for linguistics to consider them separate languages.

By contrast, the distinction between Dutch and Flemish is political, not linguistic. ""Flemish"" is, by definition, the variety of Dutch spoken in Flanders. However, it seems that what this map has done is to simply assume that ""Flemish"" is a language distinct from Dutch, though the map gives no clue as to what that assumption is based on. If you assume that Flemish is not Dutch, you could also assume that both Dutch and Flemish are the daughter languages of Middle Dutch: that from a population that spoke Middle Dutch, two distinct linguistic groups emerged, a Dutch-speaking one and a Flemish-speaking one.

I think the map erred on this one. I would not have included Flemish at all, since ""Flemish"" could refer to any one of the Dutch dialects that are spoken in Flanders, some of which are also spoken in substantial parts of the Netherlands as well (Brabantian and Limburgish in particular). I'm not an expert on Dutch, but IIRC there is not enough linguistic evidence to support a claim to a Flemish language distinct from Dutch and common across the Dutch dialectal zones in Flanders.

Where we diverge is on two key nuances concerning the problem. The first is the scale of the problem.  You can not integrate individuals who don't know how to write and read. To have individuals than can be integrated you need to educate them so they can be able to cope with the demands of modern society. For somebody to be able to go to school they need their primary needs to be taken care of: shelter, food, clothing. These people are soo soo poor that they can barely barely meet these needs. We are talking medieval level shit right here . To take one of their work able ( older than 10-11) child away from a family in this condition could mean the difference between subsistence and plain hunger. But let's say the Romanian state would have the money to put these children in schools till they finish high-school. This leads me to my second point. The corruption in Romania is so endemic that the government has colossal problems in implementing any kind of projects. So even if we had the money, reaching the ones in need with this money would be a problem. (It's the same problem with the EU funds. Romania simply is not able to spend but a small fraction because of the corruption) There is much to discuss on why and what and when but I'm just describing the realist perspective here with key insights from inside. :) ",0,1377987766,null,0,false,0,cbz9b0x,t3_1lbc9e,t1_cbz9b0x,t1_cbz8a37,null,1429632918,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Or, plusieurs journalistes placent leur accent sur la première ou la seconde syllabe comme il faut le faire… en anglais. Par exemple, on ne doit pas dire : ""MOnique LAberge, RAdio-CAnada MONTréal"", mais plutôt : ""Monique LaBERGe, Radio-CanaDA MontRÉAL"".

Consider that people tend to live in the same town and keep their family near for the most of their lives, as opposed to the US where there is much less contact with your extended family and you are much more likely to move 1000 miles away from your social and familiar circle (in some cases, every few years), so you'll be on your own much more often. For this and many other reasons, some people believe that American culture is much more friendly towards strangers and newcomers.

And then you have the whole American customer service culture. People here tend to value price over anything else, many people don't mind if the cashier is outright rude if it's 10% cheaper. There are no ""mandatory"" tips whatsoever, so managers don't press their employees to be nice or polite, they just want total submission and obedience.

As a Spaniard, it's really awesome when you travel and interact with Americans, especially if you get to do something like staying with a host family.
