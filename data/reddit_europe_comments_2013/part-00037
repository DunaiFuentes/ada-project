However, there were supposed to be fines and repercussions but since Germany/France didn't really want it, so it never happened. 

However, since the lack of discipline, caring about rules, treaties, paying fines wasn't working at all, they re-negotiated the rules. Same rules, this time you are just supposed to follow them, and really, really pay fines if you don't. Oh, and for the countries who are already breaking the rules (like Belgium with its debt for example) there has to be a positive trend

This ha been assured, again and again to win the confidence of the people- this time everyone will obey. Everyone will pay fines. Fiscal discipline is obligatory. Ha, I will believe that when I see it.

true,eddarval,PORT,Portugal,"From my experience (also lived in Spain where I have family and half my family is actually from), yes.

When Portugal and Spain are recipients of migration waves it's usually from former colonies. In Portugal it was immigrants from war torn Angola that fuelled the growth of the late 90's. That is quite visible in Lisbon where you can't take two steps without crossing with an African. The same thing doesn't happen in the interior of the country since these workers were usually non skilled construction workers. And construction was manly focused on the big coastal cities (Lisbon, Porto, Faro).

On the 2000's and until the foreign-debt mess we're in, the flow from African immigrants stagnated because of the stability and growth Angola is living. From then on, it was Brazilians, who, if I'm not mistaken, are now the biggest ""minority"" in the country. But they didn't stay just on the big cities. It's rather easy to see a Brazilian anywhere in Portugal (of course there are towns where it's more likely to see them since like with all Diaspora people tend to concentrate).

The same is pretty much true in Spain, but to be honest I couldn't tell the Spanish American accents apart except for Mexicans so I can't say which ones were more prevalent (definitely not Mexicans though).",0,1361738364,null,0,false,0,c8kxmt0,t3_1956qg,t1_c8kxmt0,t3_1956qg,null,1431393884,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Generally speaking yes it does. This could be for a number of reasons, linguistic being an obviously logical one.

There's also direct policy regarding it. For example, GB passed the British Nationality Act (1948). This allowed the 800 million citizens of the Empire to live and work in the UK without a visa (rebuilt the British labour market post-ww2). Until the Commonwealth Immigration Act (1962), all Commonwealth citizens could enter and stay in GB without restriction.

Its also easier because after many years of Imperial immigration stronger immigrant networks/communities are established. Its easier for an Indian to move to GB than some other countries because of strong Indian cultures in the UK (Empire is crucial to this).

Other than that its simple history (this is not an Imperial example, just something influencing emigrant destination choice). GB took lots of Poles after WW2 when the Soviets came into Poland. They established themselves here (I believe the UK hosted the Polish Government in Exile). Much like the Indian example, over time networks established and now Poles may well find it easier to come to the UK than elsewhere (maybe simple things like it being easier to get Polish food here than some other West European countries).",0,1361742663,null,0,false,0,c8kyvyc,t3_1956qg,t1_c8kyvyc,t3_1956qg,null,1435579611,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Andalusian: Either the witty guy (andalusians are often thought of as funny, super friendly people, wich is not that farfetched) or the guy that will go out of his way to not do his job, as often andalusians are associated with the more lazy spaniards.

Gallaecian: Sad/melancholic people, or just resigned.

Basque: Tough boys, basque jokes often display them as what we call ""basto"", wich would roughly translate as ""not polished in his actions"". They are seen as the more brute region, and for good measure they are (look some of his traditional sports, they are pretty crazy!)

Catalan: Snob people, that's because in catalan there's a lot of what's called ""open vowels"", wich in spain is associated with upper class.

Castilian: As leesamuel said, ""paleto"" accent, the rednecks.

Of course, they're just stereotypes and not if any of people from those regions fit the stereotype, but it remains and is still often endured through comedians and such. If you want some more detailed information about  some of the accents or why they're seen as that, just ask.

Source: I'm spanish with blood ties in almost all of those regions, and besides, they're pretty standard around here.

No... just... No!

Europe colonized the world because of a great many deal of factors, but wealth and technological advance was not two of them.

The colonization of the Americas (or rather how it was colonized) for example was possible because the native didn't have anti-bodies to the diseases the European were caring.

It was the colonization of the Americas and the glorified piracy by Europeans on the Indian Ocean that brought the wealth you are talking about. Before the colonization started, both India (the sub-continent) and China were as wealthy and rich as Europe. The reason China didn't colonize the world at the time was a shift into internal policy by the Emperor Hongxi, but before him, Admiral Zheng He made several voyages around the Indian Ocean.

Combine that with their latest 75% tax on income over $1 million(which most large-scale investors are certainly hoping to make) and it paints a pretty clear picture.

Worthy of note only because JP Morgan established the first foreign bank in France. Can't help but notice he didn't relocate his operation there.

&gt;On France’s ailing competitiveness, Mr Montebourg points to the government’s new €20bn tax credit for business, which he claims will reduce by 6 per cent the onerous social charges imposed on French employers. 

Ah yes.  Just what companies want: More paperwork to get the money they already made sent back to them rather than just taking slightly less in the first place.

Even Better: [That's still 10 billion shy of what France's government commission said was necessary](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/06/us-france-competitiveness-idUSBRE8A50SP20121106).

And on top of that *they're raising the VAT tax to compensate for the tax credit*. Meaning the actual cost of doing business will rise to offset the money they're being given *back* that was intended to offset the cost of doing business in France.

Being a German myself it's hard for me to actually sense this (German behaviour is normal for me, I've grown up in this society) but I've heard many times that Germans tend to be pretty reserved in general (e.g. compared to Americans) and towards anybody. I (for example) wouldn't just start a conversation with some random stranger on the bus or anywhere else and I'd actually feel uncomfortable if someone suddenly started talking to me in such situations. We are not chatty or very extrovert in general - that's just the way it is.

In that way, not being able to strike random conversations with Germans isn't primarily due to your skin colour but rather due to our mentality towards our fellow humans in gerneral. Even if you were able to start a conversation you won't be able to keep that conversation going for too long if you don't find some really good common grounds with the other person. Don't expect someone to pour out his or her heart right away when talking to someone. If you start to be too personal too soon you'll really kill your conversation. Generally, Germans have lots of acquaintances but don't have many friends among them. Building up friendships takes rather long with us (that's what I've heard at least) - men ususally only have some very few (real) friends and only one best friend.",0,1361766984,null,0,false,0,c8l66cb,t3_183zsx,t1_c8l66cb,t1_c8hc1gx,null,1431397962,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

I've never referred to myself as Somali nationally and rarely do I mention it as an aspect of my cultural make-up. My parents are Somali, I've always been Canadian, I've only been to Somalia for a month and I also spent a month in Ethiopia to meet relatives and such. I'm not a Muslim, I'm an atheist (+Bi-Sexual+Naturalist, et cetera) and I find religion to be a large part of why I doubt cultural integration regardless of nationality. The Muslim world has been stuck in the 1300s for 600 years... I do find the Muslim world terribly medieval, racist, homophobic and such but it's apparently just now experiencing the past few centuries and now it's far too much of a shock and it gets violent, angry and vocal assholes. Of course they existed before but now they have 600 years of collective human progress to complain about and attempt to destroy, it would happen if you flash forward any nation that far into the future. As for Somalia, take a good look at a globe sometime will you. It's no surprise why it's a failed state. It has nothing to do with a particular group of people. It's a perfectly understood fact that human history has been shaped by location, location, location. First the fertile crescent, then the Mediterranean, Atlantic Europe and now it appears the Pacific is on the rise. Ah, but I'm pointlessly explaining particulars that won't hold any sway in this argument aren't I? My point being that your views on race and it's inseparable relation with culture or behavior is bullshit. Take the Jewish peoples for example, or any religious minority in the human past, regardless of where. Rarely are humans kind to those they perceive as different. This is a result of culture and the supposed superiority one might have over another. I find the 'superior' cultures are those that allow for an ideological removal from one's own culture. If you view yourself as Green and only Green your not going to find anything in common with someone who's Red. You for example, see little or less humanity in those who are 'Negro'. It's education that allows for individuals to be less bias and more individuals rather than some nationality or culture that means very little. We don't need more division is my point, we need less, far less. Otherwise humanity fails. I find that I'm neither pro nor anti immigration, I'm pro-humanity.

Edit: The Eugenics, or whatever other 'science' that you're talking about has yet to state a reasonable case. The science of racism is more so than not influenced by cultural factors rather than any factual basis. You can take a group of 'blacks' in say, Mexico City, and find that they have the lowest GDP per capita out of any other demographic and yet find contradictory results if you instead look at a group of 'blacks' from Queens, New York. You can find a discrepancy in, income, literacy and IQ regardless of where you look but the statistics are far from universal. Of course one may make claim to 'blacks' as a whole possessing less ability than those from China or India but that is again geography. You find a similar case in India, China and central Mexico as you do in Europe. They had begun to develop civilization due to geography. The surface minerals that are vital to early civilization, arable lands, load bearing animals. The likes of which are unavailable in Africa and thusly make it multitudes more difficult to create and sustain civilization.

true,mars20,null,null,"Nah, that is wildly exaggerated. In the whole franconian region the dialect is quite smooth, that means: It's hard to differ between ""d"" and ""t"", ""p"" and ""b"" and sometimes ""g"" and ""k"" when it's not the accentuated syllable. Also a ""g"" at the end becomes a ""ch"" sometimes. Therefore Bamberg =&gt; Bamberch for example.

If someone has a strong accent, you'll have a hard time, but these are not that common anymore, esp. not in the city. Bamberg has a large US garrison and is quite a bit touristic, so people there are used to non-german speakers.

What do you want to know about bamberg? Here are my standard tourist recommendations for the region:

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*[Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.
*[Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 
*[Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing
*In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!
*Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

**Bamberg:**
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.
* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)
* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above
* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;hl=de&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=18)  as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.bamberg-guide.de/bamberg/bierundbierkultur/kellerbilder/titelfoto-bearbeitet.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.
* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;num=30&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;t=h&amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;radius=15000&amp;t=h&amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.
*Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recomment ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**
*[Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here
*[Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)
*Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see
*Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live, and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car.
*[Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremburg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle there and live there.
*[Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.
*The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.
*At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.

It's really math.  You said ""Let us assume you are right and that the number of rich people is actually, say, 10 times higher"", and that's what I did. You gave numbers for people earning 300.000 euros or more, and I estimated they would pay 40% of their income. Then I multiplied the two. I didn't check that the data made sense, I wanted to show that it _is_ a sizable part of the evasion (also because it doesn't include the 100.000-300.000 euro range).

&gt; this phenomenon can't be fully attributable to tax dodging by the richest taxpayers.

Indeed, it cannot. People who don't request invoices (evaded VAT) are just as responsible.  That's why I always pay by credit card in restaurants, so I force them to pay taxes without getting into stupid discussions. Unfortunately the stupid discussions do happen when I pay with my meal tickets. :/

But I rarely hear from doctors ""50 euros without invoice, 60 with invoice"" (i.e. the professional lets you evade VAT).

Ist es also in ""der Mitte"" angekommen? Habe gerade mal ""Evangelikalen des Islam"" gegoogled um den Kontext der Aussage von Lohlker zu finden. Gibt neben der welt auch wieder einen schönen Überblick über die islamophobe Blogszene. Den Originalartikel in dem Haufen geistigen Abfalls zu finden ist beinahe unmöglich. Allerdings basiert die ganze Annahme ""die Mitte"" wäre bei dieser Meinung angekommen u.a. auf dieser Aussage. Die Suche nach der zweiten Person ergab etwas anderes:

Der zweite Link war wohl der der für die islamophobe Meute geschrieben wurde (auch simpler, kürzere Absätze, mehr Bilder, klare Denkvorgaben). Dieser hat sich bei google [gut](https://www.google.nl/search?num=100&amp;hl=de&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;complete=0&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.welt.de%2Fregionales%2Fkoeln%2Farticle113852537%2FSind-Salafisten-die-Evangelikalen-des-Islam.html&amp;oq=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.welt.de%2Fregionales%2Fkoeln%2Farticle113852537%2FSind-Salafisten-die-Evangelikalen-des-Islam.html&amp;gs_l=hp.12...1437.1437.0.2167.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.0...1c.2.4.hp.rTakqGeYmWY) verteilt im Gegensatz zum [ersten](http://i.imgur.com/u05mFfd.jpg) welcher immerhin auch schon von gestern ist. 

Von welcher Mitte reden wir den hier? Von der Mitte der Rechten? 

Lustigerweise ist es das christliche [pro-dingens](http://www.pro-medienmagazin.de/journalismus.html?&amp;news[action]=detail&amp;news[id]=6166) Magazin welches etwas mehr von Lohlkers Aussage zitiert:

&gt;Lohlker erklärt zum Salafismus: **""Es ist gewissermaßen die islamische Ausprägung eines Evangelikalismus, in der Form der Gemeinschaftsbildung, die gegen die Auflösung bestehender Bindungen gerichtet ist. Das findet man in allen Weltreligionen.""** Die Umkehrerfahrung sei für die Islamisten wesentlich: ""Auch die Art der Konversion, das hat sehr große Ähnlichkeit mit Erweckungsgottesdiensten christlicher Prägung."" Ob evangelikale Christen nun aufschrien, sei für ihn als Wissenschaftler nicht relevant. Auf die Frage von ""Christ und Welt"", ob Salafisten die Reformatoren des Islam seien, antwortet Lohlker mit Ja. Reformatoren und Salafisten vereine der Wunsch, die Religion von ""historischen Anhaftungen"" zu befreien und ""Widerstand gegen die Verfasstheit der Welt"" zu leisten.

Das liest sich schon etwas anders. Es liest sich logisch und wer weiß was noch in dem Artikel gestanden hat, den die Welt clevererweise wohl nicht online gestellt hatte. 

Daraus macht Stoldt:

&gt;Vor Kurzem nannte der Islamwissenschaftler Rüdiger Lohlker in einer großen Wochenzeitung Salafisten die ""Evangelikalen des Islam""

Dem entsprechend ist der restliche Artikel full of shit. Während er sein übliches Islam-Bashing Programm unter dem Mäntelchen der Salafismus-Kritik fährt wird den Evangelikalen ganz tief rein gekrochen. Wie gut, dass wir die Welt haben. Wo sonst traut sich noch die Mainstream Presse solch einen Schwachsinn stehen zu lassen?

Meiner Meinung nach sollte man die Evangelikalen nicht unterschätzen und die Salafisten nicht überschätzen. Überlegt man, dass die Evangelikalen mit ihren Jesus Camps, Milliarden von Dollars und der breiten Unterstützung in allen relevanten Kreisen und der Bevölkerung der USA noch im Aufbau sind während den Salafisten der finanzielle Grund und Boden wegbricht, sehe ich die langfristige Gefahr eher bei den Evangelikalen. Klar werden die sich keine Bombengürtel umschnallen und in Teheran die U-Bahn in die Luft jagen. Dafür belobbyisieren sie gerne Politiker die gerne von neuen Kreuzzügen schwafeln und die Islamophobie verbreiten. Da wird auch schon mal der eigene Nachwuchs zu Rittern des Christentums erzogen auf das sie im Nahen Osten für das Wohl des Christlichen Abendlandes kämpfen. So tötet jeder mit den Waffen die er hat.

Die geschwächten christlichen Kirchen in unserem dekadenten Westen warten nur auf solche Heilsbringer und ich bin sicher wir werden in den nächsten Jahren mehr davon abbekommen.

risiedo all'estero e quanto segue e' quanto *mi pare* di aver capito.

Dunque, quando tu vai ad abitare all'estero ti iscrivi all'AIRE (ambasciata o consolato, non ricordo dove sono andato). Questo dovrebbe essere un registro che viene poi mantenuto nel tuo comune.

Alle elezioni dall'amasciata ti mandano per posta le schede elettorali. In pratica dentro il plico trovi le schede, una busta bianca anonima che conterra' le schede e una specie di certificato elettorale. Tu voti e metti le schede nella busta anonima e la sigilli. Poi metti questa busta in una piu' grande, assieme al certificato elettorale e rispedisci tutto all'ambasciata.

Ora io immagino che loro mandino tutto al tuo comune e che alla fine risulta che tu abbia votato nel tuo seggio. Il ""certificato"" credo serva proprio per simulare la scena ""Mario Rossi ha votato"".

Quindi se un comune ha 200 residenti all'estero iscritti all'AIRE, avra' 200 schede ""in piu'"".

È uscito con la matita in mano, Beppe Grillo, dal seggio di Sant'Ilario dove ha votato verso le 11, insieme con la moglie Parvin: è dovuto tornare indietro e restituirla agli scrutatori: «Volevo vedere se è veramente copiativa», ha detto. Ma seriamente ha invitato a leccare le matite per evitare brogli? Non è poco igienico? «Ma no», risponde, «ho detto solo di inumidirle, non di leccarle». 
 
QUASI UNA GAG - «Ero un po' indeciso su chi votare», continua. «Quasi quasi votavo Casini che mi dà fiducia perché ha dietro un uomo operoso come Caltagirone». Previsioni? «Forse prenderemo il 5 per cento». Come sempre, ce n'è per tutti. Pronto a dialogare, dice, «se gli altri partiti che non hanno fatto che offendere ci chiedono scusa e perdono, allora possiamo dialogare». Ma, rincara, i leader dei partiti sono tutti «vecchie gatte che cantano Memories, come la gatta di Cats, vivono nel passato, di ricordi. Sono finiti».

Grillo vota a Genova, poi il post su Twitter: sarà un piacere Grillo vota a Genova, poi il post su Twitter: sarà un piacere    Grillo vota a Genova, poi il post su Twitter: sarà un piacere    Grillo vota a Genova, poi il post su Twitter: sarà un piacere    Grillo vota a Genova, poi il post su Twitter: sarà un piacere    Grillo vota a Genova, poi il post su Twitter: sarà un piacere.

SANT'ILARIO - Il seggio nella scuola agraria che fu frequentata da Rodolfo Valentino dista dalla casa di Sant'Ilario, vista magnifica sul mare di Genova, un centinaio di metri. Lì Grillo seguirà i risultati: «Li aspetterò nell'orto, perché ho dovuto trascurare la mia povera insalata. Chissà come si è ridotta la lattuga». Per i commenti del dopo voto rimanda al blog. «Non avete ancora capito che questo non è un partito, è una rivoluzione di civiltà che cambierà tutto. Leader? Quale leader? Noi non abbiamo un leader, per indicare la strada usiamo il Gps».

«CHI HA VOTATO ALTRI È UN COLLUSO» - Le domande fioccano dalla piccola folla di telecamere, giornalisti e fotografi e Grillo risponde con un sorriso sornione: «I soldi per il nsotro programma e per il salario di disoccupazione li troviamo eccome. Ci sono 98 miliardi di euro di evasione fiscale. E poi ci sono le Province da abolire, le auto blu da eliminare, i costi della politica da tagliare a fondo e ci siete anche voi con i finanziamenti all'editoria da cancellare». I risultati elettorali arriveranno dopo le 15, ma tanti cittadini avranno comunque votato altri partiti, che dice a queste persone? «Chi ha votato certi partiti è un colluso. Colluso con quel potere e quel sistema».

The lower class is avoiding taxes as well, just differently:

Whenever they let a professional or business provide them with a service through the hidden economy in order to avoid taxes on earning, they are also avoiding taxes on what they spend themselves (namely, the VAT).

For example (let's imagine a VAT of 20% for easier computing):  
I go to the hairdresser to get a haircut.

Above all, there was a program about it recently, on the radio, wherea rather famous Swedish history professor took part. It was sent with regards to that a new standard  edition of ""Swedish history"" was published, or, to be more exact, the volume where one covered the Sami history. Basically they were discussing who came first where/when etc and all participants agreed that the discussion was/is rather redundant. The oldest artefacts found are not Sami. Most likely, there were hunter gatherers there from the south first. Whether they were removed, had to move because of the Sami, etc, is rather uniteresting, apart from a historical point of view. What is important, is that the Sami, who has been discriminated, are not any more, have a chance to their own language etc. That they have been badly treated, is not the issue. But so has the Romas, and we most certainly haven't colonialized them. 

Therefore, I find it rather fascinating, that, when Swedish historians/archeology professors can come to the conclusion that we will never really know ( also, was someone there before the ice age, we will never know), that you can claim to have inside information on this. Frankly, I believe those who has studied this their whole life, not anonymous Internet person who has a weird, own definition of colonialism that goes back to the Stone Age.

&gt;First you hark back to prehistory to find arguments, and then suddenly it's not important that they have been badly treated in the past but only what happens now is important... so we should only take into account the periods where they weren't in a subordinate position? Well, obviously they weren't colonized then.

Perhaps I didn't express myself clearly. What was discussed that it is beyond a doubt, that technically, the Sami were not there first. However, what everyone can agree upon, is that whether or not one was there first or not, the Sami has not been treated well. It is the same with the Roma, or the Jews for that matter (in France too, as far as I know). We certainly did not colonize Roma/Jews, but that doesn't absolve us from the fact that we have discriminated against them, and that we shouldn't do it again. 


&gt;1. Swedish people settled the area and 2. the Saami people were in a subordinate position, not being legally recognized etc. That's sufficient to speak of colonization IMO.

It is indisputable that Swedish people settled the area *first*. 

&gt;That's sufficient to speak of colonization IMO.

No, according to your definition, but not really. Everyone who are in a subordinate position, are not colonized. Jews are Romas are an excellent example of that. 

So, no, you still have no evidence that they were colonized. However, they were treated badly. You seem to mix those two things up.

true,keepthepace,FRAN,France,"&gt; Switzerland is a small, rich and homogenous country, with an educated population and high civic sense.

Don't forget that they have lived for centuries in this highly democratic system, which may be the cause of several of the characteristics you mention. They are rich because they decided to not take sides in WWI and WWII. They fund education generously, they are picky on immigration and vote several times a year, which may do something to your civic sense.

Yep, women suffrage happened late. 27 years after France (which is not *that* a long time). It required a constitutional change which means that in **every** canton, 50% of the men had to be in favor. They have their own Texas, but women voted in cantonal elections far before that ([starting in 1959](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage_in_Switzerland#Introduction_of_Women.27s_Suffrage_at_the_Cantonal_Level). Actually they had to wait until the early 90s to force every backward canton into accepting this decision.

When I hear my grandparents, I wonder if in 1971 50% of the French males really were in favor of women votes. I still believe it is preferable to wait for a whole population to agree on something to decree it rather than decree it first and force it upon the population. Turns out that when you need an approval of the majority, there is a higher incentive on sane education.

You also have to admit that such a doubling of the voting population, even legitimate, is a rather unique and irreversible event in the life of a republic. They had to overcome a few safeguards to make it possible.

Swiss probably are, as a population, a bit misogynistic and xenophobic. Probably more, than, say, Californians. Yet, their system is good. I am not particularly fan of the decisions the Swiss make but love how they make it.

true,e1821e,GREE,Greece,"I'm not in that position, but I have friends and relatives scattered all over Greece, facing such difficulties. I also have extensive knowledge of the country, as I lived in many different places from my birth until my graduation from the university. I lived in small and bigger islands, and in small and larger cities in the mainland, including Athens and Thessaloniki (Greece's second city). I also spend my holidays in villages.

For better or for worse, Athens' metropolitan area attracted 4 million people. That's more than a third of the country. A policy of decentralization could work, but it needs money and money is tight right now. So you're still left with millions of people working already in Athens. Rents are somewhat higher, but the figure I've mentioned is not for a super studio, in the most expensive area, in the centre of the city. It's for a normal studio in a 20-30 year old building in a relatively cheap residential area. This is valid for Thessaloniki also. Now, for smaller cities, you could subtract roughly €50, but you'd have to move and find work there. With 3 out of 10 people out of work, if you're lucky enough to have work *now* you don't move *anywhere*.

Starting your own business in one of the smaller cities could work, but you need some initial capital. Banks rarely give loans right now and competition for the most viable business plans, in projects co-funded by the EU, is fierce.

Ideally, I would like to see at least half a million people leaving Athens and starting businesses in poorer regions of the country, but this is only doable in the long run. In the meanwhile, people are left with what they're left, which is not pretty. The ""troika"" idea was to ""regain"" competitiveness by reducing workers' salaries, but given that Greece does not export as much as Germany (I believe the ratio between them is 3 to 1?), it killed consumption. This, in turn, killed other businesses offering goods and services, which ultimately increased unemployment and caused unrest. That design was wrong from the start, there's no point in offering some debt reduction after you've exhausted the people. It should happen from the start, it would be easier and cheaper for Greeks and Greece's creditors. We would have avoided these crazy Nazi and lazy shit thrown all over the place.

I dati delle proiezioni non sembrano più così infondati...

**Edit:** Il centrodestra ha preso 0.2 punti in due minuti (!), il centrosinistra ha perso 0.15 punti. In un'oretta, -0.8 per Bersani, +0.8 per Berlusconi. La regressione verso la media non ha mai fatto così male.

**Edit 2:** Secondo i miei conti approssimativi, Berlusconi sorpassa Bersani alle 18:40.

**Edit 17:54.** Per la prima volta in un'ora e mezza, Bersani recupera 0.03 p.p. e Berlusconi non guadagna nulla. Forse ci stiamo avvicinando ai dati veri? O semplicemente i seggi si stanno rallentando? **Edit 17:55.** La seconda che ho detto.

**Edit 18.07.** La cosa bizzarra è che il centrodestra guadagna quasi sempre lo stesso che viene perso dal centrosinistra. Unica spiegazione che mi sovviene: nelle regioni più schierate (Emilia e Toscana vs Lombardia e Veneto) gli altri partiti (M5S e SC) hanno preso pressappoco la stessa percentuale.

**Edit 18.24.** Dati delle 18:21 danno 32.99 per il CSX, 29.12 per il CDX. La perdita di Bersani è rallentata, la mia previsione per il sorpasso è da rinviare anche di un'ora, ammesso che ci sia davvero un sorpasso (IPR, unica fra le società di sondaggi, proietta il CSX in vantaggio al Senato).

**Edit 19.28.** Variazioni dei dati reali fra le 18.34 e le 19.23: CSX -0.37 punti percentuali – CDX +0.43 p.p., in meno di 50 minuti (mentre prima avevamo variazioni dello stesso ordine in 10-20 minuti).

I follow them because they submit informative posts. In this exchange, they were passionate but very respectful of each other. The tl;dr is that they disagreed about the percentage of Golden Dawn vote among Greek policemen. krattr (seems Centrist) believed that although Golden Dawn's percentage was high, the newspaper reports showed inflated figures. Naurgul (seems Leftist) thought they were not that far off. There was some brainstorming and despite their disagreement, krattr found and shared a trick prompting Naurgul to start analysing the results. Naurgul posted his analysis using polling stations near Athens Police headquarters. krattr responded by analysing a much larger number of polling stations (239 instead of 44), using also data from the repeat elections in Greece's second city. Naurgul disagreed about krattr's use of these polling stations, krattr responded that this was necessary in order to have a representative sample. Naurgul also argued that data from the repeat elections painted a different picture because there was an attempt to prevent the Leftists (SYRIZA) from winning, but checking the figures in the biggest polling stations did not prove it. Eventually they found common ground as Naurgul rephrased his conclusion, and they live happily ever after. krattr tried to go one step further, but the Ministry's server blocked him when we went for the full monty (grabbing data from all the mixed polling stations in the country).

Mostly what matters in the context of this subreddit is that the candidate which the EU preferred and who is the most pro-EU got voted in with a healthy margin.

It's almost not worth debating parties such as AKEL, since the previous president from that party has generally been Cyprus' ""George Bush"". Basically the guy was an incompetent idiot who managed to take a country with surpluses and generate large deficits. The numbers speak for themselves.

2) Because they could team up with 2 or more different lists but the same candidate for prime minister. Teaming up they can avoid some access restrictions to the 2 houses based on the number of votes

One can tell that Swedish history isn't your strong suit. We were all hunter gatherers then, the Swedes as well. I think we settled around 0- 500 AD or something, so fairly late from a European mainland perspective.  So, the nomadic Swedes were there before the nomadic Sami. So, you count nomadic against nomadic - and Swedes came first. Thus, they are the colonizator. 

&gt;here were Mesoamerican peoples before the Aztecs, but that didn't stop them from being colonized.

So, the Sami colonized Sweden then, since we were there first, and then we are removed, or at least fairly few of us up north. That makes Sami the colonisator, not the colonized ones. 

&gt;All in all, the terminology has its roots in Roman practices:

&gt;Under Italian electoral law, the coalition or party that wins the biggest share of the vote gains an automatic majority of some 54 percent in the lower house.

Thats whats wrong. Even if you win with a single vote more than everyone else you can take the entire lower house of parliament and use that majority to fuck with the decision-making progress of the government. It's like the Republicans blocking Obama through their Senate majority.

2.Italy is notorious for ever-changing coalitions and parties. I am from Germany and we have a hard time finding stable coalitions among our 6 major parties. Italy routinely has dozens of parties with a few politicians each in parliament, many of those are splinter-parties that formed after the (often happening) breakups of larger parties. It's madness.

3.Good question, I personally think its ridiculous to keep voting until the result pleases the winners and leads to stable coalitions

4.Grillo won't form a coalition with anyone, he's more or less a frustration vent for the anti-euro crowd of Italy that's not gonna vote for Berlusconi. And the other parties don't seem to keen to join forces either. Bersani and Berlusconi wouldn't form a coalition if you forced them at gunpoint

Can't speak for Japan (although their policies have served as examples to the rest of the region) but S. Korea is definitely not ethnically homogeneous and foreigner free as people like it to be. You compare but you do not equate standards. Their labor market is whoring out for trained foreigners since the early 90s. Can't bother to search for a source but there are a lot of (also Muslims in the face of Malaysians) foreigner labor force filling up jobs in S. Korea. S. Korea has been having labor shortages and besides having insane wage and union restrictions they've been importing a ton of foreigners. And it's only going to increase with time because S.

 [this Wiki article](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legge_Calderoli#Circoscrizioni) about the electoral law, which states:

*«La distribuzione dei 617 seggi della Camera fra le singole liste è ora definitiva. La legge suddivide i seggi guadagnati da ogni lista fra le circoscrizioni, in proporzione ai voti ottenuti da ogni lista locale. Nel compiere tale riparto, essendo fisso ed immutabile il numero totale di seggi assegnati ad ogni lista, può verificarsi la necessità di variare il numero di seggi originariamente attribuiti alle singole circoscrizioni elettorali.»*

Translated in English:

*«The distribution of the 617 seats of the Chamber of Deputies among the lists is now confirmed. The law distributes the seats earned by each list among the districts, in proportion to the votes obtained by each local list. By doing this distribution, as the number of seats assigned to each list is immutable, it may be necessary to modify the number of seats originally attributed to the single electoral districts.»*

So, if I didn't miss something, the seats are distributed in proportion to the number of votes received in each district, and the original assignment of seats to each district (which is reported in the next table in the article) may vary in order to get the right numbers.

&gt;ALL DANCE MUSIC IS ELECTRONIC, YOU IDIOTS
When I first heard the term ""EDM"", I wasn't sure what it stood for. I assumed the ""M"" probably stood for music, maybe the ""E"" was European or eclectic, And the ""D"" could have been ""digital"", a reference to it being created on laptop software, perhaps. What I did not expect, however, was something as blitheringly obvious as ""electronic dance music"". It seemed like calling a genre ""guitar rock"" or ""trumpet ska"".

&gt;All dance/house/bass music is electronic. Just say it to yourself; Electronic. Dance. Music. It sounds like somebody's great aunt attempting to talk about Moby's new album, or a clueless country police chief answering questions about a rave he's trying to shut down.

true,farox,null,null,"Hey, I did almost the same thing and moved from Germany to Paris for years and returned.

Here is what's happening:

You have to pay taxes in the country that you work in, full stop. So there is no ""only after 6 months"" or any such non-sense. (Technically there is, but if you're full time employed and you work there, this doesn't concern you.) If the work is being done in Paris, that's where you pay for that period.

Also there is a double taxation agreement between most countries. This means that you never have to pay for the same money you earned twice. So, that's good news.

Now lets say you move there in July and start working immediately. This would mean 6 months in Berlin, 6 months in Paris. The shitty thing that's going to happen is that both countries will treat you as if you would have worked there the full 12 months and make you pay 1/12 of that per month in taxes, which may bump you up in taxes. (6 months per, not 12 though) However the year after when you do your taxes you can get some of those taxes back.

This used to be a substantial amount, but not anymore. When you do your taxes the year after you have to declare your french income in Germany and vice versa. (Or you just run the numbers and if you see it's not much difference, then just don't)

But none of this is really hard and requires a couple of hours the first time. Just keep all your salary slips etc.

About Paris :) Don't sweat it, you're french and it's not a total shithole. For a couple of years I found it doable, specially if you have some more money at your disposal.

Be aware though of the totally crazy rents you have to pay.

Just make absolutely 100% sure that the company helps you relocating and that they step in as guarantor if you have a hard time getting an apartment. I worked for a french company and they just didn't care about this for the longest time, thus I lived in a hotel for 6 months.

No, he did not do anything. He just increased taxes. And what do you get when you increase taxes (by so much)? Scared people. People afraid to spend. Thus, market contraction, which spirals down into more of a a crisis.

He increased VAT by one point (from 20% to 21, and menaced to increase it by other two).  
He reintroduced the tax on your first house.  
He put a tax on fuel. It increased by TWELVE cents overnight.

That is not how you tax people when you want to get out of a crisis. He taxed everyone, including the poor soul who has a shitty home and has to drive his car to get to work. While all this, to the rich, didn't matter, because they could afford paying that.

You want to tax people? Take the money out of their bank account. Like they already did in 1991. Overnight (and no warning at all, either!) *everyone* woke up with about 1% less money in their bank account. Now that is something that hits everyone equally.

Well this is where it gets interesting.  Most people would, but if the negotiations here aren't open, most people won't notice.  More to the point, we will likely see a lot of distortion about what the agreements are (either oversimplification or ignoring the bits that aren't popular).

1. This doesn't factor in the refugee population which can be found here for [Germany.](http://apps.who.int/globalatlas/dataQuery/reportData.asp?rptType=1)The numbers are large though refugees are  pretty good explanatory variable for why so many receive welfare. For example, there about 48,000 Iraqi refugees in Germany, and about 51,000 of total Iraqis claiming welfare benefits.  
2. This assumes that immigrants don't contribute to the economy at all. They are a source of cheap labor and probably don't utilize some government services like college education as much as native born do. And they all buy services and goods in their new country as well.
3. What is true for Germany isn't necessarily true for all other countries with large immigrant populations. 20% of UK born males claim any government benefit (sickness, income, child support, unemployment) where as 23.1% of immigrant males do. And 51.1% of UK born females claim benefits while only 47.3% of all immigrants do. A difference, yes, but much smaller compared to Germany's 7.5% vs 18.6% for immigrants. [Source](http://ftp.iza.org/dp6144.pdf). 
Or let's take Australia, here is the Department of Immigration's own conclusion:

&gt;The major finding is that, overall, the overseas born have slightly lower welfare-recipient rates than do the Australia-born for each age group. This conclusion holds for almost all age groups in each of the States as well. The only exception is for overseas-born persons aged 45-64 in Victoria and South Australia.

Germany's situation with high number of foreign born on welfare is largely due to its immigration policy. Turks were mainly recruited as low-skilled guest workers, Russian Jews due to 'repentance' for Nazism, and other refugees/family reunification. 

This can be further illustrated through comparison with another immigrant nation, the U.S. median household income is $51,222. Indian Americans, very highly-skilled, though, are about $90k. Chinese $67k, Japanese $65k.  But compare that to those that are more likely to be of refugee background: Afghan $42k and Hmong $46k.

true,ajehals,null,null,"&gt;Did you write the article we are currently discussing?

Yeah I did, which is why I thought I'd drop a few comments in for clarity where I clearly failed to do it first time around.

&gt; Either way you seem to know a lot more about the nuances involved in this proposed free trade deal,

Not at all really, the only thing we have so far is an agreement to negotiate.

&gt; and I apologize if this comes across as a child debating an adult. I also am quite ignorant about exactly what ACTA entails, so I cannot bring much to the conversation here either.

Not a problem, although I hope you saw some of the issues that came out of the ACTA trade stuff (and for that matter that have come up a few times since).

&gt;Either way, don't you see a scenario where one side will have to make concessions, and the side that makes said concessions spinning some b.s. back to their constituents about having to do something outrageous because the other side couldn't negotiate?

I do, that's the concern.  The only way to deal with that is to put as much pressure on as possible to ensure that there is transparency, that way at least (for better of for worse) people can discuss the issues and try to make their points.  One of the issues with ACTA was that the text wasn't really available to anyone and a lot of the negotiating was done quietly.

&gt;I would also think that units would be an issue if there were to be common standards. I am not sure because the US and the EU have been trading for decades now, and they must have already resolved the issue of not using the same issues.

Units aren't really an issue because they are convertible and labelling and such (which could become an issue, for example requiring GMO's to be labelled, or requiring certification for certain terms etc..). The 'standards' in question tend to be pretty specific rather than overarching like say, metric vs imperial.

&gt;Sorry, but I am honestly a little out of my depth if you have written articles about this issue. I have a very topical understanding of this, and I definitely do not know the scope of the details and concerns that would need to be addressed.

The basic two points I suppose are fairly simple, if we are going to have a trade deal between these two massive blocks, then there will be a lot of pressure from business to reduce barriers.  Those barriers, will include things that many people see as protections, some of those will be protectionist (so subsidies etc..).  But if we keep any negotiations out in the open and we aim to maintain standards in areas that we agree are important, rather than lowering standards across the board to make it easier to facilitate trade, then we will be OK.  The concern is that in the past there have been attempts to essentially do things behind closed doors and leave people worse off because it's better for one interest group or another.

Think back to Belgium. Their parliamentary system usually leads to many small parties, but they must still form a Government which has the support of Parliament. There's not much point in having a Government whose Budget or other major piece of legislation could easily fail. It is impractical, leads to uncertainty and (by definition) instability. 

Germany imposes a 5% threshold, which does the job for them due to their now large established parties. But why did they impose such threshold? Because of the instability caused by their elections resulting in no tenable Government. Their Parliament was composed of many small parties, which led to many unsuccessful elections, and ultimately the rise of extreme populism in the form of one Adolf Hitler and his NSDAP.

And I said comparing to the prices from Eesti Krone... 

So it seems like you are no better than the ""Russian propaganda machine"" you are talking about.

In Tallinn the rents has doubled in a short time 'cause of the ""economic boom"". And Estonian workers are ripping off all the copper they can get from Finland... I believe you don't want me to dig up that dirt here?

So grow up and face the facts.

For a nice place (2 rooms, 40m2 and up, renovated kitchen, within walking distance of the Old Town), you should expect to pay between 300-500€ before utilities (which can add another 200€ to your monthly living costs in winter).

Monti: pro euro. Wants to cut spending, more liberalizations, more flexible work laws. Tax big holdings. Fairly similar to Bersani.
