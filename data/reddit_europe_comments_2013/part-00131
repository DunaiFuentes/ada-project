true,Vaeldr,ITAL,Italy,"&gt;What is the basis of these claims?

First of all I think we can all agree that Alexander the Great is Greek(Macedonians claim he's Macedonian). So that's not the beginning of their nation.

I can't speak for the Serbian arguments. Anyway once upon a time khan Asparuh made Bulgaria. Later Bulgaria became a big country, the biggest on the Balkans and of the strongest in Europe. They fought against the Byzantium empire and won many times. During these times Macedonia was always a part of Bulgaria(then again so was most of Serbia and Romania so that's not a huge argument). But unlike Serbia, Macedonia never really had wars with the Bulgarians. They were never conquered tribes. It always seemed they were part of Bulgaria unlike the Serbs who were often at war with Bulgaria.

Later the Bulgarian king Samuil(who Macedonians now call ""Sam**o**il) had his capital in Ohrid. He has a good story google him, it's interesting. Anyway he was a Bulgarian king, his capital was in today's Macedonia.

But then, the really big thing came. Bulgarians were enslaved by the Ottomans. In the 1800's the Ottoman empire made a map showing which regions were inhabited by indigenous Bulgarian population-[here's the map](http://lambo.blog.bg/photos/29038/original/Bulgarian%20Land.png) . So that is where the fist real claim about Macedonia(and parts of Serbia and Greece and Romania) comes from. 

Later the Russians as you very well know liberated Bulgaria and made the [San Stefano treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_San_Stefano) in which Bulgaria still included a lot more lands than it has today. Here is Bulgaria of [1878]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Bulgaria-SanStefano_-%281878%29-byTodorBozhinov.png)

Later in Berlin the Great Powers gathered to decide the future of the new country. The conference started with Otto von Bismarck saying: ""Today we are gathered here not to think about the happiness of the Bulgarians, but to discuss our own interests."" This conference resulted in cutting Bulgarian land leaving it only a small autonomous country giving land to the neighbors and this was the [result](http://www.sbv.hit.bg/images/4-3.jpg) . They didn't want a strong country on the Balkans under Russia's influence-who can blame them?

The cutting of the land was ""The national question"". Today many of these lands are still not in Bulgaria(including Macedonia).

What we are sure of is that by the 1900-1930 Macedonians described themselves as Bulgarians. The Serbian rulers did many things to wipe out this Bulgarian feeling in Macedonians, including changing the used alphabet.

Today many of the people Macedonians consider as their revolutionaries though of themselves as Bulgarians- Misirkov and Gotse Delchev. They are Macedonians as much as Alexander the great is one. They died in Bulgaria and though of themselves as such.

&gt;but can we really say that Macedonian is just a ""dialect"" of Bulgarian or Serbian?

Yes. Macedonian is almost the same as Bulgarian. As I am a person who speaks Bulgarian I ca assure you there almost no difference.

The 'AWAKENING"" of the Macedonian nation is the creating of them as a nation-one they have never been before the 1940's.

&gt;Was ""Macedonia"" as an idea created by the Yugoslav republic to troll Bulgaria?

Yes. I'm sorry but yes. It's the truth. Especially Tito.

true,platypusmusic,null,null,"police faces situation like this on a REGULAR basis: dealing with people on drugs or people who are psychologically ill. it's not the police job to go out and shoot around. The use of guns is the VERY LAST RESORT in extreme situations.

Maybe you missed a bit of context which i checked in the news.

So what's the situation? Guy sits on a bench and suddenly takes out a 20cm long knife and starts to cut his arm. Suddenly he gets up takes off his clothes and jumps in the pond where he hit himself again with the knife this time in his throat. It's safe to assume that he's OBVIOUSLY suicidal and not acting fully rational, maybe under shock or under influence of drugs, but more likely psychologically ill.

Several cops are at the scene. They ""try to calm down the man and ask him to drop the knife"" naked man doesn't follow. Now one cop gets in the pond and approaches naked man. Naked man doesn't like it and walks with the knife in his left hand to the cop who shouts: ""Drop the knife!"" twice while naked man moves the knife from the left hand to the right. Cop steps back hits the pond wall and shots in the naked mans chest from ~2m distance. 

Shot in the chest hit the lungs and was confirmed as cause of death.

So yes the police made many mistakes. Getting one guy in the pond with a gun was maybe was the crucial mistake. IF the goal was to take the knife from the guy they could have used pepper spray, tear gas or batons (I think even a taser could've worked, but wouldn't be that smart to use in the water). They were several cops and disarming a guy with a knife in a coordinated action shouldn't be that hard and actually part of standard police training. 

But by getting in the pond himself with a loaded gun the cop basically already preset the sad outcome. The cop clearly messed up as using the gun is explicitly prescribed as the VERY LAST RESORT if no other method would be possible. 

Also before firing a shot the cop has to shout a WARNING that he would use the gun, which this cop clearly didn't.

For reference here are the actual guidelines for Berlin cops 
http://www.berlin.de/imperia/md/content/seninn/abteilungiii/vorschriften/uzwg.pdf?start&amp;ts=1117091070&amp;file=uzwg.pdf

Oh and German cops kill less than 10 people annually, some years less than 5! So obviously the cops behavior is not COMMON practice, also not the rougher Berlin.

p.s. IF the naked man really posed such a threat, why did the police man turn his BACK to him after the shot and climb out of the pond.",0,1372504231,null,0,1372524412,0,casks4w,t3_1hargj,t1_casks4w,t1_caskbfu,null,1430642838,0,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,0

Yes it's confirmed. Shot through the lungs killed him. 

&gt;There were clear warnings given, and it was one controlled shot, rather than the hysterical blazes of gunfire you hear about from other parts of the world.

No shot warning was given, they only asked him to drop the knife. The shot was fired when the cop walked backwards against the pond wall right in the chest. That's two times the cops fucked up.

&gt;The man was coming at him with a knife.

He walked towards the cop with a knife. Yes but not in a striking position. Not once had he actually made an attempt to hit the cop with the knife. He was also holding the knife in the wrong hand before he switched.

&gt;It's difficult to give warnings prior to having to defend yourself with so little time to react there. 

Well then don't just jump in the pool with a loaded gun. Actually there was plenty of time before to assess the situation with a couple other cops.

Before the financial crisis most people who took loans took them in foreign denominated loans, they did this mainly to benefit from lower interest rates that foreign currency denominated loans offered. 

Now if Latvian Lat would devalue, you would have huge  wave of bankruptcies around the country where anyone exposed directly or indirectly would go out of business. There would be nothing that the Latvian state could do about it, it would be game over, that is why Latvia never devalued their currency during the financial crisis and instead took a bailout package from the EU and IMF in size of 7.5 billion EUR.

So, the answer is they have lots of foreign currency denominated debt and there is nothing they can do about that.

No way. If you drop Moldovan into Google translate, it will assume the language is Romanian.

My aunt lives in Ireland and runs a bar where people are supposed to only speak Irish and I can't understand *anything*, not even enough to vaguely follow what is going on. Irish also doesn't have cuss words in the same way most languages (including English) have cuss words.

After years of working as a professional in the United States, I had no choice but to work for my uncle carrying plumbing supplies and doing other manual labor. He paid me well, 500 euros a month for that kind of work. It was off the books.

I wasn't the only to work that way. In fact, the reason you still see many young and ""unemployed"" Spaniards still enjoying their cervezitas y tapas is because many do work off the books. 

That is the problem. Sure the government has much to fix within itself, but the underlying issue is the Spanish mentality of doing favors where all parties involved benefit.

I came back to a United States in 2010 that was just as shitty economically and again I found myself doing manual labor off the books. 

It has taken me years to finally get back to the economic standards that I had once been accustomed to here in the United States. 

The author of this article is in my opinion extremely naive. The economic downturn is/was just as brutal here in the united states for someone starting off as it is/was in Spain. 

She was there for the shit of it all and expected what? To live like Hemingway? Maybe she should have gone to Spain in the 80's and early 90's, when American's were mostly more prepared for professional jobs than the average spaniard, when a salary could afford one to live within decent standard, and when arriving with 500 dollars in your pocket meant you would be okay for at least 6 months. 

Again, I don't know what she was expecting living in Spain between 2009-2013. 

I learned a great lesson from my attempt because I would love to one day move back to Spain. Don't go back unless I am financially secure. Whether that means having a job waiting for me, or a job that allows me to work remotely. But nothing beats the quality of life that one has in Spain. When things are well, no one lives better.

Spain needs to go through changes. Some might eventually be severe. But when this writer says that Spain needs to invest more in their people, obviously they haven't been in need here in the United States.

Spain gave me El Pago when my uncle could no longer afford to staff me. Spain gave me a free education while I waited for something to turn up. Spain gave me peace of mind and healthcare while I stressed over the lack of work. Spain does much.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; There isn't an evil fairy who shuts down businesses after a devaluation. What's the transmission mechanism between currency depreciation and private sector insolvency? Do private parties have a lot of foreign denominated debt?

Like I said before, foreign currency denominated debts. If you are individual, company or bank with foreign currency denominated loans and the value of your domestic currency goes down, your loan and interest payments go up. Now multiply this effect with the whole economy: huge amounts of money is removed from consumption and investments and instead used to pay higher loan and interest payments.

Now part of the reason why Latvians like Estonians, Lithuanians and almost everybody in the eastern Europe took these foreign originated loans was because these countries are capital poor. For their economies to grow, for investments to be made, they needed and still need foreign capital for it.

Exactly one person has taken me up on that, and I'm really glad she did. A few details I remember (it was years ago):
- Tenant responsible for hall lighting and fire extinguishes (in contradiction with state LTA)
- Bunch of stuff that obviously related to drunken college parties, just sort of onerous
- My fave, the Notice clause. Notice would be considered served when delivered by First Class Mail OR ""left with a person of reasonable age found on the premises."" This was in a dense city neighbourhood. I explained to her that she was never going to receive Notice by First Class Mail, or probably at all. Signing it would be the same as agreeing that the landlord served Notice just by claiming they had.

More commonly, it's well *after* they've signed. Two recent examples, same guy:

Has problem with *roommate,* and have to explain to him that in his 'joint and several' lease, they were legally the same person for purposes of the lease, and the lease was useless in settling differences between them. He moved out, then..

Landlady goes into his bathroom when he's not home and takes digital photos of his Rx meds. I ask to see his lease, only for the formality of pointing to the several different clauses related to this. Come to find out, it's an off-the-Web lease, loaded with errors, for a *different* state (citing the wrong statutes and everything). Also with several careless typographical errors, which I traced back to the original after a Web search that shouldn't have surprised me with how quick it was. The lease was for a standard unit tenancy, but his was a domicile sublet, and the lease contained nothing defining 'his' private space. It's like *no one* looked at that lease, at any point.

Also, there were multiple officers and only one took the shot. If there had been a real immediate threat there would have been more shots. Only one guy freaked out and decided it was time to shoot.

I do wish for compassion and commensurate behaviour. Yet, in case someone is actively threatening someone physically, regardless if healthy or mentally ill/under influence, same law applies for everyone.

Yes, officers are trained for that kind of scenario, yet nothing can prepare you for it happening in reality. It is fairly reasonable that only one of them shot since the target was moving towards the officer (may result in friendly fire) and they were in an open public place (may result in civilian casualties) - the only one with a clear and safe shot was the guy in the fountain. In situations like this, with adrenaline rushing through your body and your survival instinct kicking in, you do not take the time to aim for non-lethal shots - you only shoot to disable the attacker. 

The ""attacker"" was moving towards him, even if not running, with a knife in his hand and did not react to two warnings, so he became an actual danger to the officer. It was one of those ""either him or me"" situations, maybe the guy would have stabbed the officer lethally and would've been shot immediately. The decision basically was made when he ignored the warnings and kept moving, the only thing open was the timing of when ""it"" would happen.

I wish to express my strong disagreement with the ""good riddance"" thing and already shamed other guys here for acting like that. But this was a clear case of self defence. Sure, I would have liked to see this end without any injuries or deaths, but it did not. It turned into a binary decision very quickly, with little time to react.

Danke. Ich bin aus allen Situationen heil rausgekommen (alle Anderen - bis auf den Selbstmord - übrigens auch). Sind allerdings Geschichten die ich nicht auf Reddit ausbreiten werde. Zu dem Mann mit dem Messer aber soviel: Ich habe damals abgewogen was für mich schwerer wiegt, das Risiko mich zu täuschen und die akute Gefahr zu unterschätzen oder die Polizei hinzuzuziehen und am Ende vielleicht miterleben zu müssen wie etwas ähnliches passiert wie jetzt in Berlin. Ich hab mich gegen die Polizei entschieden, versucht dafür zu sorgen dass er sich auf mich konzentriert, sich nicht bedroht fühlt und ihn dann bei erster Gelegenheit von seinem Messer getrennt.

makes no difference if you work in a store from 8 am to 8 pm or if you do the night shift from 8 pm to 8 am.

I've done night shifts (not in a supermarket though) but its not a big deal.

There's a few reasons to do shopping in the middle of the night though.


1. you are completely drunk and now want icecream or cookies or whatever (seriously middle of the night is where the drunk and weirdos come out, its really entertaining)

2. no lines at 3 am. There will be nobody else there you can do all your shopping without screaming kids or slowpokes who just stand in front of a shelf and don't move. trying to channel their inner spirit animal or something to try and decide which brand of cornflakes they should buy.

3. register is always empty 

4. the employee at the register just wants you out of the store so they can go back to doing whatever they did before so there won't be any small talk


Reasons to work in the middle of the night:

1. no customers, you might have to sell stuff to 3-4 people in an hour when you normally have to do that in 5 minutes.

2. you can just bring a laptop/cellphone and dick around the internet all night long arguing on reddit about something. or comment on peoples shitty spelling

3. you meet some really entertaining insane people (seriously this is awesome if you are male and able to defend yourself against touchy crazy (male because way less touchy crazy))

4. you get more money at night. night shift usually pays between 15-25% more than day shift. So yeah you do the exact same job as someone during the day, but you have to actually work less and at the end of the month you make 1/4 more than those working daytime with way more work.

5. loved working on Sundays/Holidays cause thats an automatic 100% bonus (Sundays/Holidays are double pay + 15-25% for night shift) (say you get 10 bucks an hour during day shift, on a sunday you get 20 an hour and after 8 pm you get 22.50/hour (25%))

In western Europe, from south (Spain France etc) to north, and in most of Americas, LGBT people are allowed to voice their demands for respect, dignity and equal treatment. Even if people disagree with them, they can't shut them up, and they won't *try* to shut them up because it's going to be a political suicide. Those laws you hear about the American South ""don't say gay in schools"" etc are shortlived. But over here, even at an individual level, you can't advocate for your *own* rights if you are gay. Russia passed a law criminalising this last week. Unanimously. 

In my country, it's still not a legal offense to talk about LGBT rights, but noone will listen to you if you are openly gay. I was told countless times that ""You are biased, you can't talk rationally about this topic. The discussion ends here"" (the topic being societal and legal discrimination). The majority of the people will only listen to the straight allies. And when it comes to political discussions, sadly those 3 MPs here that talk about LGBT rights, make the conscious decision to talk only about a subset of LGBT people (""the good gays"") and ignore all others (especially the transgender community, because that's an ever bigger stigma), and even hierarchise and cherry-pick the rights that ""the good gays"" should have. ""You will give you anti-bullying and registered cohabitation. Now please stop criticizing us, we are your only supporters and you should respect that"", wrote one of those MPs on his facebook page. And some gay people indeed feel like only the ""good gays"" will have a chance to be respected, so they turn against the other three letters of LGBT.

You don't constantly hear about Russians and Chinese eavesdropping on state matters - even though anyone with a damn clue is positive that they do that.

You really only have to pay for food and a place to live which you can totally do with 500 bucks a month (just get roommates and you pay very little rent) and making 500 bucks on the side means a mini job where you work like maybe 30 hours or so a month.

Obesity is def. not caused by shift work thats caused at best by the laziness shift work may cause. work all night go to bed when the sun comes up and then when you get up are too lazy to do anything before going back o work.

Especially not cancer. There is no way this could be researched in a clinical trial avoiding the regular causes for cancer. 

General tip: don't buy anything thats on WebMD, there is a reason why Doctors and medically relevant institutes/governments and whatnot point out that the content on WebMD is not written by doctors or any kind of verification on who wrote the content. Hell even Google qualifies WebMD as untrustworthy when it comes to the content.

main issue with WebMD, it will state ""research shows"" or ""some trials"" but it will never actually cite any trials or research where one could look it up (not even paywall results).

This one on the last page even points out that this ""study"" was done with 10 people and the author even points out that this study doesn't say anything.

actual quote from WebMD on this entry by the lead scientist on the study:

""A small laboratory experiment can't fully reflect what's happening to actual shift workers. It's also possible that some of these health effects might improve as people get used to shift work. On the other hand, it's also possible that these effects would just worsen over time. For now, we don't know.""

Also if you look around on WebMD pretty much everything on symptom on WebMD results in you having cancer.

Seriously WebMD is one of the worst sources for medical info ever. wikipedia has better standards on medical content than WebMD (and wikipedia also isn't considered an acceptable source for medical info)

Je ne connais pas du tout Nîmes mais je pense que certains conseils restent valables:

2) Peut-être ajouter seloger.com ?
Il faut bien prendre en compte ce que l'on appelle les ""charges"" qui comprennent **généralement** (mais pas toujours) au moins l'eau et l’électricité. Il faut vérifier que le prix de location annoncé par une annonce comprend ou non ces charges. En effet un loyer peut paraître bas et finalement devenir important en y ajoutant les charges ou bien le chauffage (si c'est au gaz notamment). Si c'est un chauffage éléctrique, c'est bien entendu à prendre en compte aussi.
Attention aux honoraires si vous passez par une agence qui cherche pour vous un logement. Cela peut vite être cher. A l'inverse, il faut être assez """"""méfiant"""""" lorsque l'on passe par des annonces de particuliers à particuliers. Attention à ""l'état des lieux"" si vous prenez un logement.
Celui-ci doit être parfait afin de vous éviter de mauvaises surprises à la fin de votre séjour en France. 

En resumé:
- Quelle surface ?
- Quelle adresse ?
- Quelle prix ? Ce prix inclut-il les charges ? Que représentent les charges ? Eau, éléctricité, gaz ?
- Quelle type de chauffage ? Attention aux logements mal isolés qui peuvent revenir cher à ce niveau là. Normalement, un diagnostic ""énergétique"" doit vous être fourni pour une location. Celui-ci est utile pour avoir une idée de l'isolation thermique du logement et donc du coût en chauffage. Le chauffage peut parfois être collectif et donc inclut dans les charges.
- Moyen de transport à proximité du logement ? Cela peut-être intéressant de le demander à la personne que vous contacter. Voir vérifier sur GoogleMaps/RATP.fr .

Pour les transports, le site RATP.fr devrait je pense vous permettre de faire des simulations de trajets (en bus, tramway) d'une adresse A à une adresse B. Normalement, cela fonctionne aussi à Nîmes.

Vivre sans voiture est bien entendu possible mais cela dépend des commerces à proximité du logement. Il peut être intéressant de s'installer en centre-ville si cela est possible financièrement. 

Pour les meubles ? IKEA :) ? Au moins cela permet de meublé rapidement un logement à moindre coût. Certains appartement seront fournis directement avec des meubles ce qui serait probablement plus pratique pour vous.

Je n'ai pas le temps de compléter vraiment ce message mais je vais essayé plus tard si d'autres conseils me viennent à l'esprit. Idéalement, il faudrait qu'un gentil Nîmois vous donne des conseils ici.

true,wellthatsjusthurtful,null,null,"Bonjour,

J'habite à Montpellier, mais je connais assez bien Nîmes.

1. Nîmes est une très belle ville, plutôt touristique. Le centre ville est vraiment beau mais les loyers y sont assez chers.
Certains quartiers sont à éviter : Mas de mingue, Zup et chemin bas d'Avignon.

2. Pour trouver un appartement les sites d'annonces sont plutôt efficaces : ils permettent de prendre plusieurs rendez-vous à l'avance. En arrivant on peut faire 4-5 visites, et on peut trouver un appartement dans la journée.

3. Il y a des bus pour se déplacer dans l'agglomération. Et on peut aller trés facilement en train dans les villes alentours (Montpellier, Avignon...) On peut vivre sans voiture, et le vélo est une bonne option, car le climat est plutôt agréable.

4. Pour l'alimentaire c'est une question de préférences et de moyens, l'idéal est de trouver un marché près de chez soi. Pareil pour les banques ou les lavomatiques : le plus proche est généralement bien.
Pour les meubles, il y a Conforama ou But au sud de la ville. C'est assez bon marché et on peut se faire livrer.
Pour les vêtements par contre... il y a quelques magasins à Nîmes, mais c'est assez limité. Si tu prends plaisir au shopping, il vaut mieux faire 30 minutes de train pour aller à Montpellier ou Avignon.

5. La ville n'est pas très vivante. C'est touristique mais pas étudiant. Comme pour le shopping, il vaut mieux prendre le train pour aller s'amuser dans les villes voisines.

Bienvenu et bon courage pour t'installer ! Bon courage aussi pour le TAPIF, c'est aussi dur que gratifiant !

The reality is very, VERY different though. Not Barroso leads the EU, Merkel does mostly. The power will shift from France to Germany, from Germany to France, sometimes they'll lead together. But the Commission never leads, they MANAGE. Sometimes they manage a little crazily, which is how some of the weirder directives came to be.

So any provision of a contract that contradticts constitutional or statory law is inherently invalid and unenforceable. If the contract lacks a severability clause, that could render the entire contract invalid. That won't keep a landlord from trying to enforce an unlawful provision, or keep the tenant from going along with it as if it was legal, with the same effect as if it was.

I have to confess that I'm reciting that provision from memory of over 20 years ago, and it might not have been exactly as I relate it here. But it was more or less as given. I don't know if it was necessarily invalid, as I didn't bother checking it against the state LTA in force at the time, since the entire contract was crap top to bottom and unsignable. But I expect your instinct is correct, that it probably was and is invalid.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"That's the vision and also largely the realty. The Commission has the sole right of legislative initiative in the EU. That makes it pretty powerful and a pretty dominant figure. The thing is, the EC can't just do what it wants. No core-executive can. Can Obama suddenly declare war on whom ever he pleases? No, because congresses will refuse to declare war and cut military funding next time the budget comes around, because Congress is the thing ultimately in control. 

In the USA, Congress can do what ever they like. They can even impeach the president or supreme court judges, so long as they get a super majority. It's the same in the EU. The Council of Ministers is the one really in charge, but they rely on the core executive to implement thing. If the core executive (President of the USA, European Commission, Cabinet in the UK) does not do what the legislative (Congress, European Parliament + Council of Ministers, Parliament (UK)) branch of government wants, then the core executive can say goodbye to its position and say hello to impeachment from the legislative branch.

The European Commission is the EU's government. It does government things like making a budget, running certain services like the Common Market and Euro Battle Groups, has its own courts, enforces its own laws, makes its own laws, and has a semi active foreign policy. It even has elections. 

To me, the EU looks pretty similar to a state. It's just more of a confederation than a federation. Might I remind you that before the USA that we know today was formed under a federal form of government, it had a predecessor, the Articles of Confederation. The EU is even stronger than that first incarnation of the USA. If the USA under the Articles of Confederation can be called a single state or have a single government, the EU definitely can.

What you seem to insinuate in your 'question' is that Islam will undo social development in Europe. Many people who believe this, do this because they think Muslims want to implement Sharia everywhere. However, this comes from a misunderstanding of Islam. 

Imposing a very strict version of Sharia on your community is a Salafist point of view. This is just one of the many different views in Islam and it happens to be one of the most strict ones. Sharia law can be interpretated in many different ways, it's just that the Salafist version of Sharia often takes it to a more extreme level and thus generates more attention.

By taking their definition of Islam and saying it is the true version of Islam, you are giving Salafists an important victory. You are now supporting their argument that their version of Islam is the real Islam. Even while Islam knows many different rich versions. The interpretation of Sharia can change with societies.

And finally, people have the right to say what they believe, even Salafists. We simply uphold our laws and don't allow the execution of ideas we don't agree with, just as we do with the fascists etc.

true,frenchyshadow,null,null,"Hi,

(FYI, I'm French)

1 - I don't live in Nîmes, nor I know the city. But I have lived in multiple French cities in the “*province*” (outside Paris). I was staying suburb of those cities (because I'm cheap). And bad suburbs there aren't nearly as bad as the ones in Paris. But I think it's different because I'm a guy and I can act like I from the neighborhood.

So I was going to say: “it doesn't really matter where you stay”, but I guess since you're a foreign young woman, it might be relevent to ask. You can usually spot bad neighborhood if it looks [like that](http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/17460051.jpg). But we have housing project like the ones in the US (beautiful individual houses in the suburbs) but this is for poor people as well. Anyway, keep in mind that Europe is backward: bad neighborhood = suburbs, good neighborhood = downtown.

3 - I'm living in the US right now, and I can tell you it is crazy easy to get around in French cities without a car (compared to the US.) If you stay one year or more, and you don't want to invest in Car, I would recommend you to get a bicycle. If you do want to invest in a Car, be careful, most cars have stick you might will have to buy driving lessons and your US driver license might not be exchangeable with a European one.

4 - If you like good food. Welcome in southern France! I don't live here, but every time I go see some friend they have amazing Farmer's market. Go there: more fresh, sometimes cheaper, better ratio quality-freshness/price. Don't buy from people with a huge stands those are just scammers, buy from local producers only selling 3 or 4 different products. I'm amazed by how easy it is to eat vegan/vegetarian in the US. If you're vegetarian/vegan, you will have a hard time finding food/restaurants in France.

If you wanna buy furniture, it depends how long you stay. If don't stay long (less than 2 years) buy from ikea, it can be very cheap. But you will need a car because the closest is in Montpelier. One other way would be to buy furniture in “brocantes” (local sell outs).

In the US you have fees for everything. Most banks in France just have flat fees, that's all. I pay something like 23 € per year for a Visa and a checkbook: the checkbook are free, they send me a new one when I used one, I can use any ATM from any bank anywhere in Europe without any fee. It's very cheap because I'm under 26, after that I think it's 50 €, but you can qualify for this kind of account since your 22. I chose my bank because my banker is a friend from middle school, so any time I have a problem with my account I directly call her. So I can't give you the best advice. I know in the US the best is to go in a Local Bank or a Credit Union in order to have fewer fees. It's not the case in France, I would go to a large bank, because they can afford to be cheap since they have a lot of customers:
 
 * Crédit Agricole (biggest bank group in Europe), they have a lot of branch everywhere in France. Their branch network across is huge.
 * Caisse d'épargne (partly owned by the french government)
 * Banque Postale (owned by the French government, they don't gamble any money in sock exchange)
 * CIC (they are supposed to be very cheap according to their commercials. But they might have silly fees like US bank, I'm not sure)

&gt; Hmm, c'est tout ce que je peux penser. Aussi, pardonnez-moi mon mauvais français, et soyez libre de me corriger si vous l'aimeriez!

That's all right. I speak broken English too. Since you asked: “C'est tout ce que j'ai en tête. Et excusez mon mauvais français, n'hésitez pas à me corriger si vous voulez!”

What exactly could she do to stop American intelligence services from spying on Germans? 

Threaten an economic boycott?  Expel US troops?

Germany would suffer much more from a kicking-contest than the US. Congress would howl in indignation, revoke the visa-waiver program, cancel most-favored nation status etc. 

In the recent past, neither Germany nor the EU have been able (or willing) to resist American demands for sensitive information like airline passenger lists, or SWIFT financial records.

Respect for other nations and their laws has not not exactly been a paradigm in US foreign policy.  A superpower can afford such an attitude, unfortunately.

Answer: I dont think you will find a too big difference of culture between the two. I feel at home at both places (and lost aswell from time to time in both). 

I would dare to say that danes and swedes in general are quite alike. Therefor i guess that a trip to both would not make you shocked in any way. Stockholmare might be more 'with the nose in the air' - However you will find those people everywhere, even in Köpenhamn. :)

You will get around just as good in both places since both danes and swedes speak good english. 

Overall I think you can enjoy a visit to both. There will be plentyfull of things to do, see and experiance at both places. Make one trip now and another later and see what town you like the most. Either way I think you will have a great time! :)

How long do you want to stay in Europe? If it is a matter of two weeks or so you are out of luck and just have to scrap some money together for a flight and stay with a hosting family or similar. If you are willing to stay for more than a month maybe you can work on a farm or something similar. If you want to stay even longer, working over here could be an option with your newly gained Finnish citizenship.

Anyhow, if this is about money, ask the guys at frugal travel or something. If this is about legalities, for a short trip ask your local embassy or government agency, for longer trips consult your local Finnish embassy to gain Finnish citizenship.

* fare la crocetta su nazionalita ""Britannico"" su molte applicazioni e moduli (anche se non ufficialmente) rende la vita un pochino piu facile ed economica, ad esempio l'assicurazione dell'auto costa meno, quando fai domanda per un prestito o mutuo in banca fanno meno storie ecc ecc.

* la mia prole ha passaporto Britannico e mia moglie ha un altro passaporto europeo ,quando viaggiamo ( a parte che ci guardano come se fossimo agenti di Mossad) siamo sempre un po preoccupati se qualcosa va storto . L'anno scorso abbiamo perso il passaporto di uno di noi e siamo dovuti andare in 2 consolati diversi diverse ore di fila ,volo perso per 4 persone ecc ecc . Insomma meglio avere lo stesso passaporto in una famiglia.

* Il famoso referendum sull'Europa del 2017: ragazzi questi voteranno no e lasceranno l'EU ,non credo sbatteranno fuori quelli come me che sono qua da molti anni ,hanno figli casa ,lavoro ma ti faranno pagare un botto per regolarizzare la tua posizione.Per darti un idea la naturalizzazione costava circa £600 nel 2008 per coniugi ,ora costa £1550, da qui al 2017 non mi stupirei se arrivasse a £3000/£4000.Questa non e solo una mia paranoia molti expat con cui ho parlato stanno pensando la stessa cosa.

* Il voto : posso votare a livello locale ma mi piacerebbe dire la mia anche a livello nazionale

true,Maximovitch,null,null,"Hollande belongs to the Socialist Party, which greatly evolved since 1905. If it had clearly a marxist frame of analysis at the origin, it changed little by little after the birth of the French Communist Party in 1920, after WWII and among all after the first socialist President of the 5th Republic, François Mitterand, came to power in 1981. 

Indeed, in 1983, the socialist government deeply changed its politics and followed the world trend into neoliberalism (Reaganism, Thatcherism). It had an impact on its identity, because if the Socialist Party had always been more reformist than revolutionarist, since the 1980s, it now accepts without a doubt liberalism and free trade. The movement is close to what we call in Europe social-democracy. It has a large view on political and cultural liberalism (ex: gay mariage) and accepts economic liberalism. However his view on economy is not at all the one of an invisible hand regulating everything by magic. Besides the hand of the market, the socialists are in favour of the hand of the State fixing the market failures by a few interventionarism, regulations and rules. They are more from Keynes than from Friedman.

As for social beliefs, as I said, they are reformists. The Socialist Party had always been defending the rights of workers, from Jean Jaures to the Popular Front in 1936. It now has more difficulties to represent the poorest, being more or less liberal and pro-Europe in our context of distrust. Moreover, the workers no longer embody a consistent class. But they still try to defend the precarious groups such as women, the youngest or migrants.

I don't think French people really support him. His popularity in polls after one year is the lowest in the history of the regime, but we have to consider this data with our contemporary context of distrust agaisnt politicians and politics in general. Caricatures are used to paint it as someone flabby and then weak, and for some he is even inactive althought 2/3 of his electoral promises have been applied. When he got elected, a lot of rich families complained and threatened (and some did) to escape France to avoid what they consider as left-radical measures concerning high taxes for the richest. But this is not really a new thing, in 1981 when Mitterand had been elected, the myth of a symbolic sovietic invade was even more present. With the gay mariage, he has now a large part of a conservatice, catholic electorate strongly opposed to him.

It is difficult to compare their balance sheet since it has just been one year since he has been elected. What is sure is that their way of ruling are different. Sarkozy is comparable to Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, he was a President who don't care about his Prime Minister and undertook all the political measures. Hollande's style is closer to the other former Presidents, he uses his PM to initiate the reforms, is more discrete. If Hollande succeeds in stoping multiple mandates, one of his promise and one of the biggest harm to the French Republic, he will make in my opinion a great step for our country.",0,1372586403,null,0,1372593507,0,cat3odd,t3_1hctsx,t1_cat3odd,t3_1hctsx,null,1430633851,14,false,france,t5_2qhjz,14

&gt;This is the real ""old map"" of the Ancient Kingdom of Macedonia [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg

You misunderstood what I said. I didn't mean ""maps of Old Macedonia"". I meant ""Old maps"" as in maps made in the lat 19th - early 20th century about that region of the Balkans (""Ottoman rule"" section and below). You'll notice that cartographers refer to the Slavic populations of the current (FYRo) Macedonia as either ""Serbs"", ""Bulgarians"" or ""Macedonian Slavs""

&gt;The Area now known as ""Macedonia"" was never EVER part of the Ancient Macedonian Kingdom. It was a ""Dependent Territory"" but never in the Kingdom itself. 

Never said it was, and for the purpose of the current discussion, it's irrelevant. You'll notice that I did not bring up Ancient Macedonia.

&gt;The people who call themselves ""Macedonian"" today(mostly Bulgarian refugees) appeared in that area sometime between 500-1000 years after Alexander the Great had died and the Macedonian empire had vanished.

Partially. Not all of the inhabitants are descended from Slav migrants. Some are assimilated locals. But again, this is sort of irrelevant for the present discussion.

true,pazqo,null,null,"Premessa: fin da piccolo sapevo che volevo fare Matematica. Ho iniziato l'università con l'idea di vedere come va, quando ho visto che andava molto meglio di ogni previsione, ho deciso che volevo proseguire con la ricerca. Motivo per cui alla fine della laurea la scelta del dottorato era la naturale possibile. Ma ero ben consapevole, sentendo le voci in giro, di quanto fosse difficile la parte subito successiva: trovare un lavoro di ricerca. Non mi importava, ho fatto lo stesso il dottorato. Quindi avevo delle motivazioni a priori.

Fare il dottorato in Italia è un terno al lotto: se rimani nell'università in cui hai studiato, magari con un professore con cui hai studiato o che ti ""vuole"" direttamente, la situazione è, in genere, molto rischiosa: la probabilità di diventare uno schiavetto segui-tesisti e riempi-buchi è altissimo. Se ti sposti e vai a studiare in qualche altra città (Udine --&gt; Roma, per me) il rischio è molto minore, perché ti conoscono meno ed è più facile che ti prendano per il curriculum piuttosto che per un interesse diretto.

Questo è il primo problema. Il secondo problema è l'apparato pubblico, come hai già notato: dipendi interamente da burocrazie che non hanno senso. Non c'è (e probabilmente non ci sarà mai) un vero snellimento delle procedure, per cui ti troverai a passare molto più tempo a combattere con queste cose che a fare ricerca veramente.

Però c'è da dire una cosa: lo studio in Italia è di altissimo livello, ma sembra che di questo se ne accorgano solo all'estero (o in grosse aziende che sanno come funziona all'estero). Io mi sono trovato un po' in difficoltà, al momento di mollare la ricerca, perché mi mancavano tutta una serie di competenze operative, che sto recuperando. Se tu non hai intenzione di rimanere nella ricerca (come mi pare di aver capito), la strada migliore è quella di fare il dottorato, ma con un occhio molto pragmatico al mondo aziendale. E all'estero, dove potresti spendere il dottorato in modo molto più efficace (ad esempio in Germania, a parte il fatto che saresti HerrDoktor Unidraulico, avresti una serie di benefit solo per il tuo status di dottore di ricerca -nota: un laureato non è ""dottore"" in Germania, mentre in Italia basta fare un giro a Napoli e sei già dotto' lol).

Capisco il problema degli amici e della ragazza. Valuta anche l'aspetto economico: c'è la possibilità che tu all'estero possa guadagnare più di te + tua ragazza in Italia. Il dottorato a Berlino stava a 2300 euro al mese, in Inghilterra sulle 2500 sterline. Perché oltre ai fondi statali POSSONO prendere anche fondi privati, cosa che in Italia è impensabile (una vedova doveva fare un lascito di 700.000€ alla Sapienza, ma la trafila burocratica era tanta e tale, e pure le commissioni/tasse, che ha deciso di sfanculare e donare i soldi all'INdAM (che è parastatale): in 20 minuti aveva praticamente concluso le pratiche -fonte: la signora stessa + la segretaria dell'INdAM). Rimane lo shock culturale e la difficoltà di muoversi all'estero. Però paga, e non solo in termini economici.

In ogni caso, i quattro anni di dottorato passati a Roma sono, al momento, il periodo più felice della mia vita, facevo quello che mi piaceva davvero, mi sentivo crescere giorno dopo giorno e avevo abbastanza tempo libero da coltivare altri interessi -cosa diversa se hai un laboratorio da seguire-

Consiglio anche PhD - The Movie, se non l'hai visto. E' il modello americano, ma sempre dottorandi sono.

tl;dr: fai il dottorato ma con un occhio all'estero e al privato. non fare il dottorato pensando alla ricerca (soprattutto in Italia).",0,1372587924,null,0,false,0,cat3u2y,t3_1hbsc1,t1_cat3u2y,t3_1hbsc1,null,1430633776,10,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,10

Of course not, just peculiarly reluctant. :)

&gt; You'll find that we are well-integrated in to society, we all speak Finnish, my Finnish happens to on the weak side, because I come from a home where we only speak Swedish when I was little, and that we tend to be very social.

Alright, fair enough. Isn't it still a little bit weird, though, that you feel you have the right to ""get service"" in your native language, and that all Finnish people should learn Swedish for your sake, instead of the other way around?

&gt; I'm starting to think that this whole thing is just that you don't like Swedes and that's why you say that we should integrate into a society that we created and already are integrated in by not speaking Swedish. Because you sound just like a member of the Sannfinländarna/Perussuomalaiset.

As you can see on my flair, I'm Danish, and you'll see from my comment history that I'm fiercely anti-nationalist.

There is a difference between saying *to ourselves* that we are allowed to do it, and it being legal to do it in other countries.

The US does not have the legal right to commit espionage in another country, even if they ""take the right to do it to other country to.""

Germany 'among countries offering intelligence' according to new claims by former US defence analyst

The Observer, Saturday 29 June 2013 21.02 BST

Wayne Madsen, an NSA worker for 12 years, has revealed that six EU countries, in addition to the UK, colluded in data harvesting.
At least six European Union countries in addition to Britain have been colluding with the US over the mass harvesting of personal communications data, according to a former contractor to America's National Security Agency, who said the public should not be ""kept in the dark"".

Wayne Madsen, a former US navy lieutenant who first worked for the NSA in 1985 and over the next 12 years held several sensitive positions within the agency, names Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain and Italy as having secret deals with the US.

Madsen said the countries had ""formal second and third party status"" under signal intelligence (sigint) agreements that compels them to hand over data, including mobile phone and internet information to the NSA if requested.

Under international intelligence agreements, confirmed by declassified documents, nations are categorised by the US according to their trust level. The US is first party while the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand enjoy second party relationships. Germany and France have third party relationships.

In an interview published last night on the PrivacySurgeon.org blog, Madsen, who has been attacked for holding controversial views on espionage issues, said he had decided to speak out after becoming concerned about the ""half story"" told by EU politicians regarding the extent of the NSA's activities in Europe.

He said that under the agreements, which were drawn up after the second world war, the ""NSA gets the lion's share"" of the sigint ""take"". In return, the third parties to the NSA agreements received ""highly sanitised intelligence"".

Madsen said he was alarmed at the ""sanctimonious outcry"" of political leaders who were ""feigning shock"" about the spying operations while staying silent about their own arrangements with the US, and was particularly concerned that senior German politicians had accused the UK of spying when their country had a similar third-party deal with the NSA.

Although the level of co-operation provided by other European countries to the NSA is not on the same scale as that provided by the UK, the allegations are potentially embarrassing.

""I can't understand how Angela Merkel can keep a straight face, demanding assurances from [Barack] Obama and the UK while Germany has entered into those exact relationships,"" Madsen said.

The Liberal Democrat MEP Baroness Ludford, a senior member of the European parliament's civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee, said Madsen's allegations confirmed that the entire system for monitoring data interception was a mess, because the EU was unable to intervene in intelligence matters, which remained the exclusive concern of national governments.

""The intelligence agencies are exploiting these contradictions and no one is really holding them to account,"" Ludford said. ""It's terribly undermining to liberal democracy.""

Madsen's disclosures have prompted calls for European governments to come clean on their arrangements with the NSA. ""There needs to be transparency as to whether or not it is legal for the US or any other security service to interrogate private material,"" said John Cooper QC, a leading international human rights lawyer. ""The problem here is that none of these arrangements has been debated in any democratic arena. I agree with William Hague that sometimes things have to be done in secret, but you don't break the law in secret.""

Madsen said all seven European countries and the US have access to the Tat 14 fibre-optic cable network running between Denmark and Germany, the Netherlands, France, the UK and the US, allowing them to intercept vast amounts of data, including phone calls, emails and records of users' access to websites.

He said the public needed to be made aware of the full scale of the communication-sharing arrangements between European countries and the US, which predate the internet and became of strategic importance during the cold war.

The covert relationship between the countries was first outlined in a 2001 report by the European parliament, but their explicit connection with the NSA was not publicised until Madsen decided to speak out.

The European parliament's report followed revelations that the NSA was conducting a global intelligence-gathering operation, known as Echelon, which appears to have established the framework for European member states to collaborate with the US.

""A lot of this information isn't secret, nor is it new,"" Madsen said. ""It's just that governments have chosen to keep the public in the dark about it. The days when they could get away with a conspiracy of silence are over.""

This month another former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, revealed to the Guardian previously undisclosed US programmes to monitor telephone and internet traffic. The NSA is alleged to have shared some of its data, gathered using a specialist tool called Prism, with Britain's GCHQ.",0,1372589911,null,0,false,0,cat41rn,t3_1hbwyi,t1_cat41rn,t1_casvo2v,null,1430633675,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

Not really. :D I can't think of anything that's close to reddit and has a big user base in Germany. There have been some attempts to clone reddit in German, but none of that ever caught on.

Another explanation for the discrepancy you're describing might be that the number of redditors in these images are counted by people subscribed to the country specific subreddits (If I understood the OP's post right). That's a pretty shaky source, I'd imagine that many Germans who use reddit don't even know about the existence of the tiny German subreddits. And even if they do, might not be subscribed. Much of the content there consists of Americans asking questions about Germany anyway. ;)

* Something complicated: In 2005 parts of the right-wing FPÖ split and formed the BZÖ. The core province of BZÖ was Carinthia. After some time (and after the death of Haider, the figurehead of BZÖ) most of the more prominent figures of the BZÖ in Carinthia formed the FPK, a sister party of the FPÖ only active in Carinthia (kinda like the CDU/CSU thing in Germany). Parts of the FPÖ in Carinthia didn't like that though and refused to move into the FPK. And now, after the tremendous election defeat of the FPK and much quarreling it was decided this week that the FPK is incorporated into the FPÖ again. About 200 of the 500 delegates to the party convention where that was decided didn't even show up though.

* Ongoing discussions about the implementation of a more direct democratic approach.

* According to a survey, 47% of Austrians support Croatian membership - that's the most support any candidate has ever had in Austria(e: or rather the highest support concerning current candidate countries).

* The annual Danube Island Festival in Vienna took place, a three days long music festival free of admission. With its 3 million visitors it's the largest open-air festival in Europe.

* Oh I forgot: Alpine, Austria second biggest construction company, went bankrupt.

I've been living in Helsinki now for 2 years (originally from Portland, OR) and between the two in your question, I've visited Stockholm and would recommend it (though I haven't made it to Copenhagen yet). If you're in Europe traveling around, I'd recommend trying to get to many places as possible because intra-European travel is cheap once you get here (as opposed to taking individual trips from the US), like traveling between states.

If you're traveling as north as Stockholm, I should plug Helsinki, Finns in the Tourism sector / Helsinki area handily speak English. There's enough interesting stuff to see, though I wouldn't spend more than a day or two here: Stockholm/Copenhagen have a bit more to offer.

 If you have the means, consider taking a boat across from Stockholm -&gt; Helsinki, and perhaps while you're at it, stop in Tallinn and St. Petersburg: boat travel here is a pretty common for the holidays, deals are commonly posted online, and it's a convenient way of hitting up cities in the Baltic, while not having to worry about too much about the logistics of traveling.

true,Fafnesbane,FINL,Svenskfinland är det bästa Finland,"&gt;Yup. Meaning that Finnish carried a social stigma that persists to this day (although of course not to the same degree).

The first people who advocated speaking Finnish after Finland became a part of the Russian Empire were Finland-Swedes and they were not peasants, they were highly educated members of the upper-class of society.

&gt;Alright, fair enough. Isn't it still a little bit weird, though, that you feel you have the right to ""get service"" in your native language, and that all Finnish people should learn Swedish for your sake, instead of the other way around?

Of course I should have the right to get service in my language. This is our country just as much as it's the Finns'. We've fought together for this country's freedom and build it up together. We've lived here for over 800 years. The Lördagssällskapet were a group of Finland-swedes who started advocating that we should be separate nation from Russia and Sweden. Just as French-Canadians get service in the French  parts of Canada, we should get service in Swedish in Swedish parts of 

The right to get service, within reason, meaning in areas where we live.

The thing with forcing people to have both language is because it sounds nice on paper, Finland seems like a progressive nation internationally, because we are bi-lingual. Personally I think that we could take it away and in return get a guarantee from the state that we'll get service in Swedish in the areas where we live. Problem solved. But that's politics, and it's most of the Finnish parties who say we should keep it as well as the SFP/RKP.

&gt;I'm criticising a very specific power dynamic that exists between Finns and Swedes, both on an international political level and on a national level in Finnish domestic policies, that has historically privileged Swedes

What is this power dynamic on an international level you speak of?
And most Swedes in Sweden don't even know we exist, for that matter, so waht ever it is, don't you go dragging us into that.

And we Finland-swedes gave away the power to do whatever we wanted in Finnish domestic policies when we reformed the government in 1906. If the Finns wanted to make us all second class citizens and put us all in Gas chambers, they could just as well do that, we can't stop them. So don't around saying that we have some sort of political power over them.",0,1372594304,null,0,false,0,cat4jvq,t3_1h8qdq,t1_cat4jvq,t1_cat3uun,null,1430633365,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Sono assolutamente contento della mia scelta, bisogna mettersi nell'ottica che non è un lavoro, ma stai sempre studiando per alla fine ottenere un titolo di studio. Poi anche ti pagano qualcosa, ma non confronto mai i miei 1050 euro con uno stipendio, perché non lo sono (sul bonifico c'è scritto ""emolumenti"", giusto per essere precisi).

Se vorrà fare carriera accademica dovrò andare all'estero, lo so. A me che di non avere una botta di fortuna pazzesca.

La vita del dottorando è bella, o almeno può piacere: conferenze all'estero tutto spesato,  niente orari, che può essere un bene o un male: puoi presentarti in ufficio per pranzo e nessuno ti dirà nulla, se hai da lavorare ti tocca fare notte. Puoi prenderti una settimana di vacanza  e nessuno ti dirà nulla. Di solito le conferenze scientifiche le fanno in località di mare in estate e sciistiche in inverno, una scusa per fare vacanze spesate dall'università :-)

Non ho problemi con CONSIP e company, mi basta un computer, pagato con i fondi del mio gruppo di ricerca, e carta e penna, sono un teorico. Anche le trasferte le pago con i fondi del mio gruppo di ricerca, perché i fondi dell'Università per i dottorandi sono praticamente inesistenti.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; The first people who advocated speaking Finnish after Finland became a part of the Russian Empire were Finland-Swedes and they were not peasants, they were highly educated members of the upper-class of society.

That's pretty much what I'm saying.

A benevolent dictator is still a dictator.

&gt; because we are bi-lingual

Dunno, all Finns I've met absolutely hated speaking Swedish, and weren't particularly good at it (probably for that reason) — they strongly preferred speaking with me in English.

Why is it important to you that other people learn your language, when you're in their country? Sure, it's yours as well, but Basques and Catalonians don't expect to go to Madrid and ""get service"" in Basque and Catalonian.

The only difference is that you're the powerful upper class, they're not.

&gt; What is this power dynamic on an international level you speak of?

Finland has successfully counteracted it somewhat in the last 2 decades, but only with the invention of the EU. Before then, everything Sweden did, Finland did too.

&gt; And most Swedes in Sweden don't even know we exist, for that matter, so waht ever it is, don't you go dragging us into that.

And they also generally think your accent is ""ugly"", because it is influenced by Finnish — it's a rather unfortunate situation.

&gt; And we Finland-swedes gave away the power to do whatever we wanted in Finnish domestic policies when we reformed the government in 1906.

And therefore you, over a hundred years later, as a person with absolutely no responsibility or relation to those events, should be privileged for it?

&gt; If the Finns wanted to make us all second class citizens and put us all in Gas chambers, they could just as well do that, we can't stop them.

Let's not go there…

&gt; So don't around saying that we have some sort of political power over them.

Well, you do. Consider the number of Swedish names on [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Finland), and [this list too](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Finland).

true,Jonisaurus,EURO,European Union,"&gt;The Commission has the sole right of legislative initiative in the EU.

But you are missing the point. The EU itself HAS NO legislative authority. The only authority it has it gets from the TREATIES which the member states design. And they don't draft those treaties in a way that the Commission has any real leadership role.

There is a fantastic easy way to prove this. Look at the coverage Barroso gets compared to Merkel and Hollande's and Cameron's coverage conerning EU austerity policies. Barroso is a JOKE. He has theoretical power, not real power. He decides nothing.

---

&gt; Can Obama suddenly declare war on whom ever he pleases?

He can actually. The US circumvented the ""parliamentary army"" idea in lots of ways in recent history.

---

&gt;The thing is, the EC can't just do what it wants.

The EC can't do what it wants because the European Commission doesn't have any democratic authority on its own. It derives all authority from treaties where real countries voluntarily give away certain power.

The EU is precisely not a state and does not have a real government BECAUSE it can't derive authority from the sovereign, the people.

---

&gt;If the core executive (President of the USA, European Commission

I'm sorry, that comparison is nothing short of laughable. It's like saying Russia is a democratic country because it's called democratic. The Commission President doesn't even have as much power as the Chief of Staff of the US President.

---

&gt;The European Commission is the EU's government. **It does government things like making a budget**

VERY GOOD EXAMPLE. Let's see.... hmmm.... **who is debating and deciding about the budget again?** Was it Barroso trying to win support in the European Parliament and among the European leaders? Wait NO, it wasn't.

It was the southern European heads of government led by Hollande fighting against the northern European heads of government led by Merkel, Cameron and the Dutch PM. Barroso's European Commission DRAFTED the budget at the behest of European leaders.

Governmental authority with an organising and counseling role, not a leadership role.

---

&gt;has its own courts

The EU judiciary is the ONLY working branch of government in the EU currently. The EU courts are near to having the proper power. Except that the German Constitutional Court still kind of trumps EU courts, especially in bailout decisions. But apart from that, the EU judiciary works.

---

&gt;enforces its own laws

KIND OF. There is neither a European police, nor a European secret agency, nor a European army. The only thing the Commission can do is sue the states in front of an EU court.

---

&gt;If the USA under the Articles of Confederation can be called a single state or have a single government, the EU definitely can.

It's questionable whether the USA could have been said to have a single government back then. Still, the EU is nothing like that. The EU is a judicial and political monster unlike everything ever before.

We have an incredibly complex system of laws and rules and legal workings. Until the Treaty of Lisbon the EU didn't even have legal persona, it didn't even legally EXIST other than as an idea to describe things.

We have super complicated EU treaties that carefully define and create institutions and bodies. In the end what the EU is is an IMAGE of a state where all the real power is indeed not within the autonomous EU institutions but with the states itself.

---

EU policy is not drafted in normal democratic proceedings where a government commands a majority in parliament etc. but in DIPLOMATIC proceedings. **All the big decisions** in EU policy are decided in EU summits between the heads of government, and NOT in the European Parliament. That statement simply cannot be refuted.

Everything else is only theoretically relevant. Some of the ""Eurosceptic"" press, especially British press, likes to overstate the role of the Commission because that way you can attack the EU project while making it appear as if the undemocratic unelected Commission actually has a leadership role in the EU. 

The simple FACT is that EU policy decisions are decided in EU summits not in the EU Parliament nor in the Commission. We follow EU summits, not Commission meetings.

You see, it's all ok if you have nothing to hide. But I like the ability to hide my information from the government, because sometimes the government gets it wrong. 

Furthermore, if it's a foreign government like the USA, I have much more reason to be scared. When my brother was on a flight there some guys on his plane (he didn't know them) got turned around in JFK International Airport because they tweeted something vaguely terroristy sounding in a sarcastic way. Yeah, they probably shouldn't have made the joke and it was probably tastless and it was on a publicly visible platform, but they still got turned around for it.

If they're going to turn you around for making a sarcastic joke, I wonder what they'd do if the only information they had about me was that I phoned up some drug dealer/trafficker. Personally, I'd be a little scared that they'd lock me up, just to be safe. Or worse.

Ok, yes, I'm taking this to extremes. However, this is why I don't want people spying on my information. They could misinterpret things. And once they've misinterpreted things, who know what they'll do with it, or to me? Not to mention, I don't know what the USA'll be like in five or ten or twenty years time. Maybe they'll be much more ok with locking me up for longer periods of time. I might not be able to count on the UK or EU government getting me back. ect

Yeah I'm going to have to call you out on this. Unless you've worked in a police station there's no reason for you not to pull this out of your ass just to win an internet argument.

Just to let you know, when police become more deeply involved in a case (in any country) they continue to gain more rights to violate privacy based on ""justifiable cause"" up until the point of state-sanctioned violence (e.g. relocating someone to a jail or in some countries the death penalty).

**However**, the outlook of the French government is still towards a united Europe with common policy and common government. The French government have been bad here, true. They have been selfish. But when it comes to serious decisions, the French are part of the pro-closer-EU-government team.

The outlook of the British government is quite simply only to get economic and political advantages. 

And that is okay. But it's also okay when others get angry at that approach. I've lived in Germany and in Spain. In both countries there is a large consensus that the EU is more than an economic project and that there is more to it than free trade and money.

That is simply the difference.

The UK government essentially tries to drive between the tracks here, it's both impossible and dishonest. The reason why Cameron's call for a ""reformed Europe"" is dishonest is because it's simply fiction. Europe is going the exactly opposite way. We are not becoming more of a loose alliance of trade with barely any regulatons like Cameron wants it to be. We are becoming more and more of a European state with proper united government and a common set of laws and rules (and it's civil, not common law!).

The French government will in the end support that united EU. The whole thing was a French idea. The British government will not.

The lawyer of anyone under investigation can demand to see the files of inquiry, which is usually accepted after at least six months.

The reason I could see the files was because I worked for a local representative at that time who had taken an interest into the case. The custody was ruled illegal afterwards, but the court had no problem accepting the police's declaration that SMS content was metadata. We did not persue that matter any further at that point, as it took long enough to get at least that far.

1. Intelligence agencies monitoring civilians to prevent crimes such as terrorism and spot extremism.

The first point is one in which all western intelligence agencies are complicit and I think this is necessary to a certain extent to maintain security. The discussion we need to have here is to what extent we want this: where is the balance between security and privacy? Not that I am happy with PRISM, but I do believe intelligence agencies need to look out for potential terrorists.

The second point is something that intelligence agencies do against governments, true, but at the same time it is a grave diplomatic faux pas. It's wrong and when caught countries should respond against it. It's something that happens between Israel and Iran for instance, because those two countries are opposed to each other. The US is here not spying on European citizens to catch potential extremists, which is something the Western world is together afraid of, it is the US spying on European governments and EU diplomats like our nations are rivals of the US.

This worked well while Germany was repentant over ww2 and was struggling to reunite itself with the former East. However as Germany grows more confident and the all too clear power disparity between them grows wider French interests are playing archive fiddle. 

In particular the French along with the club med countries formed a block of corrupt, economically unsustainable basket cases. The euro crisis had exposed this and France has suffered as the Franco-German motor of the EU had been replaced with a much more Germanic one which is less keen of the French social and econonical models. 

The Uk had never managed to entirely balance out the French within the EU simply because the UK is wary of such political ideals at all costs and also the UK is generally more global in its thinking although the current government is the most inward looking we've had in a very long time. Building up a protectionist block doesn't sit well with the UK nor some other northern European countries. 

The EU as a means of peace and prosperity had been a great success over the last 50 odd years. War in Europe is not a very likely outcome.  However it has not spent much time listening to its people or building institutions that are reliable.  And it lacks a coherent vision for the future. At the moment all we seem to get is ""Germany must pay for everything"" which is absurd and damn unfair on the German tax payers yet sadly it is probably what will happen.

true,iconoclashism,null,null,"Congratulations!  I too am planning my honeymoon to Paris this summer a few weeks after you.  I'm happy to share my research (much of which I've compiled from Reddit suggestions and wikitravel).  I've also been before, though my fiancee hasn't, so we're doing all of the touristy things that I thought were worth it after being there and doing them mystelf.

First off, I'm been putting most of my research into a [google map](http://goo.gl/maps/N6KkQ).  Blue pins are the tourist attractions, blue circles are shopping and green circles are vegetarian restaurants.  My fiancee is vegetarian, though this may not be an issue for you.  If you do want my vegetarian research, let me know and I'll do a follow up post.  My plan is to use this map on my iphone while we're on the go (we'll have a mifi so we'll have internet on the go) so if serendipity isn't striking us we can find a close restaurant or cafe that's recommended.

My general tips are as follows:

*  Most food in Paris is good to great.  The last time I was in Paris for 10 days we didn't plan out any meals.   I tried but we could never find them when we were out and about before we got too hungry and just had to stop anywhere that looked good (hence the google map this time).  The thing though was that we never had a bad meal.  When people talk about the food of Paris being good though, it's that the quality is generally excellent and it's hard to go wrong.  There certainly are better and fancier restaurants, but I wouldn't be too rigid about planning meals out.
*  That said, my favorite meals from my last trip were the picnics we did.  We would go to a bakery each morning and pick up a loaf of baguette and then hit the Monoprix for some cheese, meat and wine (good wine in Paris starts at 3-5 euros).  Whenever we got hungry, we would find a nice park or walk to the Seine and find a nice spot to eat and watch the flow of the city.
*  Take the [Fat Tire Bike Tour](http://paris.fattirebiketours.com/).  It's run by American college students but it's a fantastic way to see the city and they did a good researching and presenting the city's history.  More importantly though, taking a bike tour you get to see a lot of the city in a short period of time and really get your bearings for where things are and if you do it early in your trip you can ask them for suggestions.
*  Depending upon when you plan to go to the museums, you can probably save some time and money with a paris museum pass.
*  When you go to the louvre, don't go in through the main entrance.  There's a [side entrance](http://seancarman.tumblr.com/post/977827928/the-secret-entrance-to-the-louvre) that never has a line.  You can exit through the main entrance which has the pyramids so you see them too.  Note that it appears you'll need the Paris Museum Pass or other tickets to use it.

Have a great trip!

EDIT:  A few additional thoughts:

*  Try to learn a few french phrases.  My experience was that if I tried to speak french to people, they opened up significantly, whereas if I started in English people tended to be a bit annoyed with me.  A simple, ""Bonjour"" or ""Bon matin"" or ""excusez-moi, je suis desolee, mais parlez-vous anglais?"" go a long way towards getting good responses.
*  Some of the best things in Paris are the touristy things.  Just because something seems touristy (e.g. all of the museums, watching the Eiffel Tower light up at night) doesn't mean that it should be avoided.
*  That said, avoid any restaurant that has a direct view of the Eiffel Tower or that's next to the park where the Eiffel Tower is.  My experience is that all the food there was overpriced and poor quality (as compared to the rest of Paris which is to say it was still objectively a good meal, just by comparison you can do a lot better by going a few blocks further away).
*  I'm still looking into the Velib bike system, but it's something we'll probably do.  I think you have to order passes online if you don't have a European credit card, though hopefully others can speak to that.
*  If you're going to do a day trip, I really liked Versailles.  The palace was overwhelming and frankly I want to skip it this time but the gardens are amazing and worth the trip by themselves.
*  Don't try to do too much.  There's a temptation to try to cram things in since there's so much to do in Paris.  Part of charm of Paris is just relaxing and wandering.  There are so many interesting things that aren't in guide books or on maps that you can just stumble upon that it'd be a shame to plan too much on miss out on the serendipity.

So this gives you a pretty good idea of where the touristy places of Paris are, and also the non-touristy places which might be worth seeing.

To choose a place to eat: avoid any restaurant that ostentatiously advertises the fact that it has a menu in English (or any other language) or that boasts ""typical French food"" (especially if that's written in English).  Also avoid places which are conspicuously near touristy places.  Look for sticker signs showing that the restaurant is in a guide like the Pudlo, the Petit Fûté, the Guide du Routard, or, for more fancy places, the Michelin (you can't go wrong with the Michelin, but it might be a tad expensive); make sure the signs are recent (if the only sign says 2008 it *could* be that they were too lazy to change it, but more probably it means that they're no longer in the guide).

Depends on whom you ask. Bosniaks and Croats don't consider him a national hero, Serbs do. He was a Serbian nationalists who wanted Bosnia to become a part of the [Greater Serbia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Serbian_aspirations_1912.jpg) project. We could sort of compare him and his companions with Talibans. In our eyes they are terrorists but they believe they're the good guys, the freedom fighters. The latter was taught in Yugoslavian schools. In Tito's times Gavrilo was a hero who fought the foreign oppressor. But now that we don't have to believe in the official ""infallible"" version, people who grew up in Yugoslavia are changing their views on him.

Nearby that place where Franz Ferdinand was killed there's a bridge. In Yugoslavia that bridge was called Princip's bridge (Principov most).

Um, they don't even try to pass legislation in the parliament any more. Everything is done through emergency executive decrees. 

With that said, there is really no way to know how close the government is to completely collapsing. They're walking through a minefield of issues and all it takes is one political accident for them to fall. Honestly, I was expecting the government to fall last week. 

On the other hand, the leaders of the parties that back the government really want to avoid having elections now, for a handful or reasons. So they're stuck between a rock and a hard place and it's difficult to predict which way things will go.

We are a competitive bunch and in a lot of cases you feel like you're being looked down on around Europeans. The natural response is essentially ""You think you're hot shit but you're not""

I think also in many cases(at least where I am, near a heavily euro hostile) people are being somewhat tongue in cheek and it just goes over people's heads. For example, we have a Canadian branch of our office. Whenever they have a ""mandatory day off"" (which really doesn't exist here) we will jokingly say ""No, we don't have that here as we are not communist"" and things of that nature.

What if he would have been a bad guy?

It's also not at all surprising that politicians sidestep our ""inalienable rights"" when from the very beginning the ten amendments had to be *amendments*. It's almost as if the founders cared too much about government and forgot about the people. The US Constitution is hardly to the point too *and it is the shortest in the world.* It leaves plenty of spots for rights to be trampled depending on the opinions of the person in power at the time. The US just needs one set of bad apples (like the Bush Administration) and shit hits the fan permanently.

I just don't see the US Constitution as a beacon of anything. There are plenty of better constitutions out there. The [constitution of South Africa](http://www.info.gov.za/documents/constitution/index.htm) is beautiful (check out that outstanding Bill of Rights). Personally I like the Canadian constitution...

Riguardo alla seconda cosa che chiedevi: sono due mondi del tutto diversi, è questione di gusti. In generale l'accademia è un ambiente che può essere estremamente stimolante ma anche frustrante, dipende dalle persone che hai la fortuna (o la sfortuna, rispettivamente) di trovarti attorno. Lasciando stare la questione paga, una vita nel settore accademico significa, e non è una questione solo italiana, insicurezza fino ai 35 anni, perché dopo il Dottorato 2-3 post-doc non te li leva nessuno, almeno nel mio settore. I post-doc in generale sono in due-tre luoghi differenti del mondo, nell'età in cui in genere la maggior parte delle persone mette su famiglia. Lo fai per passione, prima di tutto.

D'altra parte l'ambiente finanziario è il più tipico degli ambienti *corporate*. Chiacchieravo giusto ieri con un mio amico che è passato al lato oscuro: te ne vai a casa alle 18:00 e non quando hai finito (che nel mio caso possono possono essere le 16:00 come l'una di notte), molta gerarchia e molta burocrazia, meno stimoli probabilmente.

1 tsp black pepper

1 tsp salt

1 tsp ground cumin

1/2 tsp cayenne pepper

1 tsp paprika.

Spread the rub over the meat and throw it in the slow cooker with some sliced onion and sliced green pepper.  Mix a jar of BBQ sauce with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and pour it over the roast.  Slow cook on low for 8-10 hours.  It'll make your home smell wonderful!

true,Fafnesbane,FINL,Svenskfinland är det bästa Finland,"&gt;Dunno, all Finns I've met absolutely hated speaking Swedish, and weren't particularly good at it (probably for that reason) — they strongly preferred speaking with me in English.

1 THAT'S THE POINT! We are all bi-lingual on paper, not in reality.

2 You're Danish, of course they will speak English with you

&gt;Why is it important to you that other people learn your language, when you're in their country? Sure, it's yours as well, but Basques and Catalonians don't expect to go to Madrid and ""get service"" in Basque and Catalonian.

[Here's a map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Svenskfinland_municipalities_2008.png) please think about where the capital of Finland is located and most larger cities.

We have brains you know, none of us would go to e.g. Imatra and demand service in Swedish.

&gt;Before then, everything Sweden did, Finland did too.

Because we could only react, we were not allowed to do anything because we had big brother Soviet Union watching us. Ever heard of [Finlandization?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnlandisierung)

If you're talking about social reforms, we had extensive plans before the war, which due to having to pay the Soviets, could only be implemented later. After Sweden, untouched by the war, had implemented them.

And they also generally think your accent is ""ugly"", because it is influenced by Finnish — it's a rather unfortunate situation.

I've never met a Swede who's thought that. They've thought that about Finns who've spoken Swedish, but never a Finland-Swede. We speak teh way 1800th century Swedes spoke in their ears.

&gt;And therefore you, over a hundred years later, as a person with absolutely no responsibility or relation to those events, should be privileged for it?

I never said we had privilege. I simply stated the fact that whatever power dynamic in domestic affair existed was not one that gave us any sort of upper hand.

&gt;Let's not go there…

maybe I went to far... but then again, members of the Perussuomalaiset wanted to deport homosexuals, immigrants and Finland-swedes. Others openly encouraged harassment and murder of Muslims and immigrants. And one of the leaders of the party said that we should have put a military junta in charge of Greece.

Oh, wait another one had a real gem, she(I think it was a she) wanted **that we (Finland-Swedes and other minorities) should wear a symbol on our cloths so that we can be easily identified**

Sound familiar?

Oh, but here's the best part, the Perussuomalaiset are set to become at least the second biggest party in Finland.

&gt;Consider the number of Swedish names on this list, and this list too.

The two  lists are the same.. but look at the presidential list this way:

* Stålhberg(Fennoman)

* Relander(Fennoman)

* Svinhufvud(Finland-Swede)

* Kallio(Finn)

* Ryti(Finn)

* Mannerheim(Finland-Swede)

* Paasikivi(Fennoman)

* Kekkonen(Finn)

* Koivisto(Finn)

* Ahtisaari(Finn)

* Halonen(Finn)

* Niinistö(Finn)


&gt;And as I said in my first comment, the very fact that you, as a small minority population, have the majority population learning your language, just so you can get serviced in your native language, is a testament of it as well.

And as I have stated before, the politicians, the majority Finns, are keeping it that way. If the Finns don't like it, they only have themselves to blame that they didn't vote for someone how wants to take it away.

Non esiste un modello teorico microscopico di questo fenomeno (non si sa come si dispongano gli elettroni per poter scorrere all'interno del materiale con resistenza nulla); se prendi un libro di testo vedrai che ci sono varie scuole di pensiero su come si debba procedere. Il mio relatore ha sviluppato un modello che afferisce ad una di queste scuole di pensiero, io provo a estenderlo, modificare parametri, controllare che sia in accordo con gli esperimenti (molto difficile, calcolare quantità osservabili a partire da un modello microscopico può essere estremamente complicato).

In poche parole:

1) Propongo un modello
2) Calcolo cosa viene fuori da questo modello
3) Confronto con gli esperimenti

It has a very beautiful interior and the food is all about taste and presentation, with some dishes still being cooked in the same way they were prepared centuries ago.

* Helsinki hockey team Jokerit will move from national SM-league to play in KHL after next season.  

Simply cannot convey the enormity of it. To me it's awesome, to some the end of the world. Time will tell.

* After long procrastination the leader of True Finns party Timo Soini declared that he will not be a candidate in 2014 election for the European Parliament, so he will continue as a party leader over here. Claims to be the next prime minister...

true,scarcecrow,HUNG,Hungary,"&gt; Would you rather have tax increases or huge cuts to public services?


Personally, yes, in certain areas. I believe huge amounts of money are wasted due to structural issues, organization and management problems and corruption of course. Lots of that money could be spared and spent where it's needed. 

One example: the health care is in pretty bad shape, the hospitals have huge debts. A friend of mine used to live in a dormitory for doctors and nurses, owned and run by the local hospital. I visited her a few times. Once I noticed that one of the male toilets was broken, you couldn't stop it flushing, the water was constantly flowing down. Half a year later, when my friend moved out, it was in the same condition. No one cared, after all the water bill was paid by the state. Stupid communist mindset. People seem to forget that it's taxpayers' money. 


I know that bank-bashing is really popular on reddit, but AFAIK we didn't need to pay them huge bailouts during the crisis. And now our beloved government introduces one special tax on the financial industry after the other. The unpredictable financial environment scares off the investors, capital is fleeing the country. 
Apart from the dismal economic effects, eventually the ordinary citizens will foot the bill, e.g. in the form of increased banking costs. As side effect, we are in the state of constant warfare with the EU as the legal background of these taxation laws is rather dubious.


And there were cuts in public services too, in the most stupid ways. (E.g. higher education.)


Meanwhile, the government is buying votes: they've set a ceiling for the profit of (mostly German) companies providing electricity, gas, etc., reducing the household bills by 10%.  This was the *'we cut the bills'* campaign, with the foreign companies designated as the evil. They had this petition to support the measure in case there was an international scandal. Like 1.5 million people signed it, even though its effect is effectively cancelled out by the increasing taxes. 

The left wing opposition's answer: ""you should've cut the bills by 30%""


So I have doubts whether severe cuts alone could boost economic growth, but overtaxation certainly cannot.",0,1372616630,null,0,false,0,cat9w7a,t3_1hcy82,t1_cat9w7a,t1_cat8u28,null,1430630848,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

And also, I want to ask you if you think that the entrance in jail of Luis Barcenas is a positive event for the citizens.  

P: The Second... already such. 

Laughs from reporters.

P: And in regards to the first, see...



Some context: the minister of education is very unpopular.  His popularity is 1.76/10, the lowest in spanish history. That's due to that education is retrieving the strongest austerity, the government is passing another education reform(7th in 30 years) that doesn't fix the problems of the education system(but increases the power of the catholic church in the public education),  and he is creepy.

Luis Barcenas is the corrupt treasurer of the PP(conservative party) who had 60 millions in offshore accounts and  was one of the most powerful men of the party and Spain the last 20 years. He handled the laundry of the money of the conservative politicians and the conservative treasury. Like Boardwalk Empire, but with construction instead of bootlegging: ghost airports, illegal urbanizations, highways to nowhere, museum cities, formula one circuits, Calatrava buildings, theme parks...

Meanwhile, our economy keeps tanking, jobs keep not being created, taxes keep increasing, living gets more and more expensive, public debt is still breaking records, etc. etc.

* Lots of talk about new ""anti-draft-dodging"" measures (Cyprus has an obligatory 24-month military service for males that turn 18).

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"American public school product here. We learn extensively about European history. Aside from North/South American history it is the region we cover the most. 

I have definitely met Canadians traveling that talk about Canada as if it's the best place on earth. In fact, I have met more Canadians like that than any other nationality. I was in a shared dorm once and a Canadian was carrying around a full sized flag in his backpack that he would hang in the room he was sharing with others. I have also met Europeans that say Europe is the best place on earth (although I have not heard them say their specific country is though, but Europe collectively).

The guy you're talking about sounds like a dummy, but he is certainly not the only type of person living here. Some of us think the best way to learn about a place is to visit. I know a lot of Americans that think the same. 

I realize this article is a pretty negative revelation, but the top comment ""USA is disgusting"" is telling. This sentiment is not always just expressed on anonymous internet forums, and can have a reactionary response. I have met several people that will bring up negative things the US does *immediately* upon me introducing myself. It has gone back as far as the US dropping nuclear bombs on Japan. In the same vein if I met a 20-something German and immediately brought up the Holocaust people would be appalled (and they should be). But it seems acceptable, almost encouraged, to do it to Americans. 

I had a Dutch guy rant about ""segregation in US cities"" upon meeting me (I was with a group of friends in Beijing). When I mentioned the NL has segregated neighborhoods he said ""they want to live there, its not our fault."" He later told me Muslims are all ruining Europe and should all be deported. He works for a Chicago company and has been here twice for training. He was here a couple weeks ago and saw a black guy driving an M6. He said, ""how can he afford that."" His racist comments were always after a few drinks, but I find it ironic he was trying to call me out for racism in the US when he is dealing with his own issues with racism. Again complete double standard. The US is a racist shit-hole yet he wont even acknowledge problems in his country. This is despite studies that show the US is the second best country in the world at integrating immigrants, only marginally behind Canada. If it was the racist shit-hole he concocted in his head, I highly doubt it would hold this title. 

When I was in Vietnam I heard about the Vietnam war right when a Canadian chick found out I was from the US. She thought I was Canadian initially (I was hanging out with some). When she found out I was American she went off on me about the Vietnam war and other things and physically turned her back (even though we were having a nice conversation up until then). If I said, ""oh hey I'm mkvgtired, I dont think the Canadian government should be bribing government officials here to keep asbestos legal so they can export it and kill people, what's your name."" I am sure jaws would have dropped, and rightfully so.

I have had others ignore me or immediately bash the US upon meeting me (I am not talking about hours in, I am talking about right after I introduce myself.) I try my best to ignore those guys but it can definitely put you on the defensive. Especially considering its not the norm, but it surely isn't an isolated incident. When I walk into a new group while traveling (I usually travel by myself) I always get an anxious feeling of ""what the hell am I going to have to hear about this time?"" It can certainly breed a ""me versus them"" mentality. 

Edit: I should point out I have met plenty of European travelers in the US that express the same mentality of ""Europe is better."" Several have mentioned things along the lines of Chicago ""only having modern buildings."" Despite that being completely false, we have incredibly beautiful architecture because we had many of the first elevator buildings. I even had a French woman talk about how much better Europe was because you could find Nutella in all the stores and they didn't waste shelf space on peanut butter (as if that is not a petty reason, although now pretty much every store carries it, and I agree its delicious). That said, the inverse of the snobby American you describe definitely exists. 

EDIT 2: this sounds overly negative. I should point out the vast majority of people I've met from any country have been great. I only bring this up because I have only experienced this from Europeans and Canadians. That said, most Europeans have been great.

Do you mean the repatriation of the British North America Act, 1867 along with the messy subsequent amendments and ""Confederation"" documents? Well, that's really just more of a Colonial Mandate especially since only British parliament could amend it until 1982!

More likely, you are referring to the Constitution Act, 1982? Well, that's really just a new coat of paint with the Bill of Rights (Charter of Rights and Freedom) plus the new amending formula. Despite the common misconception, ""The Charter of Rights and Freedoms"" is not the Constitution, it is an embedded Bill of Rights that covers up all of the messy shit that constitutes the actual Constitution.

Among the current government's measures, there were the reform on the labour market through ANI (Accord National Interprofessionel), which had been higly criticized by the leftist movements for stimulating precariousness. The aim is to introduce some mechanisms from the danish social model, based on both flexibility and security of jobs. 

Furthermore, among promises, there is the idea of introducing a intergenerational contract between senior workers wanting to leave the market and young workers looking for training and employement.

The PS is a failure but they're not suicidal. They need support from their politicians to get anywhere, and they won't get it if they go through this reform.

Low inflation means your money is worth more over a longer period of time, I think it's pretty obvious. If you put your money in a bank or bonds that yield 8-10% per year then next year you will be 6% richer. Had the inflation been 5% as usual then you would only be 3% richer.

It would not fit into the typical parisian experience I guess, but I'll let you choose want you want to go for. The menu is maybe a bit overpriced (30€, around 40USD, without the wine), basically you get a very nice view on the Seine and the Parc de Saint Cloud through the panorama window in the dining room. The main problem is getting there and leaving afterwards as only a few taxis drive around in that corner, seconded by the fact that you get the romantic view only from the dining room, the other surroundings are quite ugly. You'll get a typical french menu though and the sunset from the dining room is breathtaking. If you choose to go there ask for a table next to the window! Hope that helped!
