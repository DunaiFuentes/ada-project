true,Afro_Samurai,UNSA,Beautiful American Empire,"200 years is certainly old, but not ancient. Stonehedge is ancient. 

100KM (~62 miles) is about the threshold for a noticeable amount. In the US at least, it's more about time spend traveling than distance, and 100KM is about an hour on the highway. 

We have plenty of small cars, and round cars. Limos are a novelty, pickups are a vehicle of utility (mostly), and farmers tend to be in the country.  

I don't know anyone who thinks of the week starting on Sunday. 

Thanksgiving celebrates a part of American history, there's no reason for it to be exported. Mostly in it for the food anyway. 

Not all American schools have entrance exams. The only ones I can think of that do are the Ivy League schools. University can be a lot of money, and student debt is one of the largest debts held in the US. 

Even at the federal level, this makes it sound like the FBI is the only law-enforcement agency.  US Marshals, Drug Enforcement Agency, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Border Patrol. Everything gets its own agency to an extent.

I'm not getting into gun politics.

&gt; while a good deal of Americans find them offensive or disrespectful (especially from non-Americans).

I don't know where they got this ridiculous notion, but that's what it is.

The only time I ever hear the term political correctness used is when people complain about it. We do have enshrined speech protections, but doesn't exempt you from consequences, and certainly not from being called an asshole. 

There's something like a 1,000 federal laws and privileges that come with marriage (mostly taxes), so it's not at all completely religious. 

&gt; For instance, there are widely followed conventions about sleeping on the 3rd date. Men know they shouldn't expect to see a woman again if she insists to split the bill (""check"" in AmE) at the end of their first date.

I must have missed this memo. 

&gt; It is almost required to have a military history to become president

No. It helps, but that certainly didn't stop the current President.

I don't know, the catalan president is a corrupt phony who wasn't supportting the independence openly until 2 years ago and is financing his party(CDC) illegally probably. His partner UDC has been doing that and it's proved and they have been together in all the elections the last 30 years. Furthermore, he is more interested in keeping the power than in the independence itself. However, the popular support of the independence is strong. It's over 50% of the population, and only 25% are against it. 

There is a small chance, but it's posible.

Pretzels, coleslaw, hotdogs(as in the sausages), hamburgers all have their origins in Germany. It's true that many of them developed into something separate in the US, but German Americans are one of the largest groups, and when they immigrated, they brought their food with them.

Tino Costa is gone, we got a nice bit of money for him but I really liked him and the midfield and I'll miss him.  Cissokho could be leaving on loan and that would upset me because he's been our best player for the left back position.  Piatti is just about gone too, and that frustrates me because I know he's gone plenty of talent, he just hasn't found his form.  If anything with him, I'd just like him to go on loan for a season to find his feet.

We brought in Javi Fuego on a free, he's solid but he's already 29 so we won't have him around for so long.  We brought in Michel who is a depth signing at best.  Romeu joined on a loan and he didn't play enough at Chelsea for me to form an opinion about him.  Finally we moved Paco into the first team but we'll still need at least one more striker.  

If Soldado is gone I'd like to bring in Chicharito, I think he'd fit well with Guardado.  Our midfield needs strengthening, so I'd like to bring in Apoño or less realistically, Kondogbia.

true,Xuth,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Firstly I need to wave my flag and admit that I will be naturally biased here as Brit. However, I just wanted to add another viewpoint to the discussion and aim to keep this as neutral as I can. I will happily take on responses, of course. My aim here is to present facts as I know them. For background: I studied this political situation in depth at University. 

The UK government bases it's current position on the wishes of the Gibraltan people who [voted in 2002](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2420945.stm) by a factor of 98.48% to 1.03% to oppose the shared sovereignty of the territory. 

Before that, the UK and Spanish governments were openly sitting down and discussing the subject of sharing control of the land.

Without the consent of the people however, it would be wrong, in the eyes of the current British administration, to discuss terms on their behalf. This has been a relatively recent double u-turn.

An often stated rebuttal of this claim is to call upon the UN resolution [Resolution 1514 (14 December 1960)](http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/152/88/IMG/NR015288.pdf?OpenElement). This resolution talks about the need of 'territorial integrity' with regards to colonies and sovereign territories. So Spain's claim is to return the rock to Iberia, if you will. 

However Britain, and in this context the peoples of Gibraltar, believe that another section of UN Resolution 1514 supersedes that particular clause wherein all peoples have the right to self-determination. Moreover, the United Nations (in [Resolution 2734, Nov 1969](http://www.un-documents.net/a25r2734.htm)) established that the size of a territory should have no baring on it's ability to exercise it's Resolution 1514 rights. This would also extend to Ceuta and Melilla of course, so there is a degree of hypocrisy on both sides! 

When it comes to the use of the Treaty of Utrecht, the Spanish government believes that the Treaty recognised British *possession*, but not sovereignty, of Gibraltar.

However, in response to Spanish claims that the Treaty of Utrecht precludes Gibraltarian self-determination, according to [U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2734](http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/349/99/IMG/NR034999.pdf?OpenElement), the principles embodied in the U.N. Charter supersede obligations under any other international agreement. Including that of the Treaty of Utrecht.

If, therefore, the British government chose to argue continued sovereignty based on the words of the Treaty, then you (and I for that matter!) can loudly call hypocrisy.

So, generally, the world has changed so much since 1705 that using the original treaty as the basis of discussion is now difficult at best. While not a perfect situation, decisions made 200 years ago and by virtue of the sustained population since, we get today's status quo. Pack onto that the 200 years of superseding, UN, EU, British and Spanish law and returning to a pre-1705 Gibraltar would be exceedingly difficult and problematic. 

tl:dr: The current position of the UK is that the people of Gibraltar have an international right to self-determination and discussions of complete or joint sovereignty can only happen if the people of Gibraltar want it to happen. The Spanish on the other-hand contend that sovereignty should be based on territorial integrity.

This means that when someone has even the smallest of crookedness of teeth in America, or very slight non-white colour, they will give them braces or teeth whitening, as they are already paying for it on the insurance. 

In the UK, it is different, as you pay for the dentist every time you go. This means that people don't want to pay for pretty much unneeded treatments, as it will cost them more. So, you'll have more people in the UK with crooked or yellowed teeth.

true,Vaeldr,null,null,"Depends on how you want to learn Italian. It can be easy to speak comprehensible Italian(like most of the native Italians) but it gets really hard when you want to learn all of it to speak perfectly. Passato remoto, trapassato remoto, congiuntivo perfetto, congiuntivo imperfetto, pronomi diretti, pronomi indiretti. We have futuro semplice, futuro anteriore and plenty of more tenses. So if you want to learn it well it's hard. The good news for you is that most Italians don't know how to use many of these tenses either.

The good thing in Italian(unlike English) is that you write whatever you hear. There are very few exceptions and a few rules you must learn like:

chi/ci, ghi/gi, gli, gn. That is about pronouncing them.

What I'll reccomend is learn these tenses and you'll know about as much as most Italians:

1. Presente-present.

2. Passato prossimo. You need it, everyone uses it. You can't do without it and it's easy because the verb never changes. You just have to pair it up with avere or essere. So basically for that whole tense you need to learn how to work with two verbs.

3. Imperfetto. That is just a simple past. It can sometimes be replaced with passato prossimo, but it's very good to know it.

4. Futuro semplice. You need the future.

5. And you need the congiuntivo. Unlike in English we don't just use you for a polite conversation. There is a whole different way to talk to people you don't know and are you superiors and you respect them. You have to use Lei. To master that you need congiuntivo presente, although the other 3 forms of congiuntivo may also come in handy.

Learn the pronomi diretti/indiretti and you're good to go.

If you read Italian books you will also need passato remoto. Although almost never used in everyday life most books are written with a lot of remoto.

You kind of need periodo ipotetico to keep up a conversation, but just the first type of periodo ipotetico will do it.

Great, let's spam this agency! Do you realise that the FRA can't just make something a ""fundamental right""? And that it already has its work cut out defending recognised fundamental rights? They can't do anything about this, and you are only making their work more difficult by flooding their inbox. You are being *actively* harmful.

&gt; Furthermore, if enough governing bodies, including the E.U., recognize sunlight collection as a basic human right, then the government of Spain will be pressured to follow suite.

Firstly, ""the EU"" isn't a ""governing body"". It has its own governing bodies, or ""institutions"": the Council of Ministers, European Commission, European Parliament and European Court of Justice. Secondly, if you want to see ""collecting sunlight"" recognised as a ""fundamental right"" by ""the EU"", then you'll have to amend the [Charter of Fundamental Rights](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/charter/). I'm pretty sure that one needs the unanimity of all EU member states for that, including Spain.

&gt; Spain has decided to tax people for collecting sunlight.

Actually, it hasn't. There's a draft law, not yet passed, proposing a ""toll"" for electricity generated by solar installations *connected to the electricity network* even when the electricity isn't fed into the network: http://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/5003443/07/13/Economia-Energia-Industria-cargara-con-un-peaje-de-respaldo-el-autoconsumo-de-electricidad-para-uso-propio.html

It doesn't affect, for instance, autonomous installations not connected to the broader electricity network. Now, one may not like the draft law (I certainly don't), but your petition still remains:

The west side (in the shape of a C) is wealthier, more liberal, has better infrastructure, includes beautiful cities such as Krakow, Gdansk, Wroclaw etc. The east seems to be more conservative, poorer and completely lacks infrastructure necessary to keep up with the west except for the Warsaw area.

(To my knowledge) : Political party do not play any official role, and are just organisation to support candidates (In France you are voting for people not for parties). So, political party are just standard non profit organisation (""*Association Loi 1901*"") , However the statute of the organisation must explicitly state that the organisation is a political party and will respect the electoral law, and the fund-raising rules (Including a separated funding organisation).  That's all you created a party. 
(Source http://www.vie-publique.fr/actualite/faq-citoyens/partis-politiques/ )

Being candidate is quite easy too, and even people without support of a party can do it (either because they have been fired by their party for example O. Falorni, or G. Freche, or simply just for fun)  but since generally it's a 2-turn vote with one people elected, small candidates get crushed, and medium party (i.e. the greens) need to make some deal with bigger party if they want to have some people elected. 
However for the presidential election, to avoid too many small candidates, you need to get the support of 500 elected peoples, it's not a problem you're from a big party, but for exotic candidates it is quite hard to get. 

One last stuff, depending of the result at the election, political party get public money (I think 1 Vote = 1.5 € but I am not sure) But to get this money party need to have as many female candidate as male candidate.

Many of the high-cost (from our perspective -- there weren't really any true high-cost erotica films ever made not counting Caligula and few other similar experiments) porn- and erotica-films of the 70s and 80s were done for cinemas (of course, as VHS or Betamax weren't yet popular). Just making a copy of the film available in one theatre would have cost 10 000 dollars (of present-day money), not counting the expenses of running the theatre. The equipment and production itself cost a lot of money -- now everybody has a camera and a computer. So with expenses like that, you wanted something that was good enough to get people to theatres and to open their wallets. It's the same with Youtube -- nobody would pay to see 10 euros to see Nostalgia Critic talking behind his table on the Big Screen -- but they would pay to see a comedy or even something similar to MST3000.  The actors (and they were actors, not just people having sex on camera) also felt they were doing art and making sex more acceptable in general -- they wanted the productions to have artistic merits, with stories. Some of the films I've seen had an hour of build-up without any skin till in the final act people get their monies worth.

That's point one. Second point is that when people are in their homes, they are just looking for something to look when they rub one off. You don't need that build-up of one hour. You just need two people doing some acrobatics for ten to fifteen minutes. 

I was quite surprised to find out that they made porn-films that had million-budjets as late as mid-2000s, though I suspect that they could get some money for selling them for porn channels (who are probably doing pretty badly as well). Not having seen most of those films (I abhor the silicons and modern gymnastics in those films) I'm going to guess, but they are probably scenes without big overarching plots. Easy to watch 15 minutes a day. Not much reason sell under one title, anyway.

But I haven't studied modern porn that extensively. I was always more interested to find out where the plot went. And we lost THAT far before the millenium. ",0,1375093889,null,0,false,0,cbchu21,t3_1j8gom,t1_cbchu21,t1_cbchkd6,null,1430225702,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

This would give people who do not follow EU's foreign policy closely a chance to bring themselves up to date with the events.


With regards to the EU's policy towards Israel, I hope that the EU will take a more active role in the peace process between Israel and Palestine. Right now, the negotiations seem to be dominated by the Israeli-Armerican partnership, which I don't think gives much hope for settlement of the disputes. Both Israel and the US are seen rather unfavourably by the Arab world given all that has happened in the past 60 or so years. The EU, on the other hand, seems to be viewed in a much more positive light when it comes to peaceful settlement of disputes. Greater role of the EU in the peace process would therefore increase the prospect of a fair and peaceful settlement.

However, on the European front, the Russians outnumbered the Allies 4 to 1, so if the Western Powers had tried anything, the Soviets would have rolled over them and imposed Soviet rule on the rest of Europe as well, so the plan was abandoned (although they still kept defensive plans, which you can understand).

Not all of our elected TD's are members of a political party.  We have some smaller parties, some of whom do not currently have a sitting TD.  Currently, there is no TD representing the Green or Communist parties for example.  

Recognition of smaller parties varies.  In order for your party name to appear beside the candidate's name on the ballot paper, the part must have at least one sitting TD or MEP, or 300 recorded adult members, it must have periodic party conventions and must have a party executive to run the party.  parties which fail to meet these criteria are still free to field candidates in the election, but the party name will not appear on the ballot.  

Political parties get certain advantages over smaller parties and independents in terms of financing and speaking time.

It might be the country that has changed borders the most in history. Several partitions between Prussia(later Germany), Russia and Austria. 

Used to be in a personal union with the Lithuanians, If I remember correctly,Władysłav Jagiełło, creator of the Jagiellonian dynasty, originally came from Lithuania. They through out the Teutonic Order in the Battle of Tannenberg in 1410. 

The South is pretty hilly and the border region between both Slovakia and the Czech Republic is littered with mountains.

They brew some quality beer, not as well known as the Czechs, but at least as good. They brew anything from largers to porters as black as charcoal.

Vodka/Wódka from Poland is also some of the best. I pretty sure it was the Poles who invented it, and brands like Żubrówka has been distilled since the 16th century.

Very friendly people, and also a pretty people(mostly the women).

Kraków is the historical capital, and a very beautiful city with old buildings, churches and the castle on Wawel hill. And then more modern Soviet apartment blocks to the East in Nowa Huta.

John Paul II was former Archbishop in Kraków, and became a beacon of Polish identity during the Cold War, along with Solidarność. I don't know if Kraków is more proud of him, than the rest of the country, but there's a fair amount of squares, roads, avenues named after him.

Then there's the Polish Winged Hussars, which were probably the most bad ass cavalry unit in history. Heavy armoured, carrying lances and sabers, along with two feathered wings on the back, these guys were anything, but light cavalry.

In the Białowieża Forest, near Białystok, on the border between Poland and Belarus, lives the European Bison(or as the Poles say, Żubr). They were reintroduced in the 20th century after all wild animals had been extinct, and they numbers keep on increasing. The area is also famed for its boars, which make hunters from around Europe go their.

There are no formal requirements for forming a party, and you don't need to register the party to run in the election. You can even order ballot papers without being a registered party. If you choose to register though, you are guaranteed sole right to the party name in elections. Registering requires proof of a central council, a decision by the council to register the name, a person responsible to put on the registration form and a number of signatures from citizens depending on the type of election. 

The number of signatures required are:

* 1500 for national (*riksdag*) or European parliament elections.
* 100 for regional parliament elections (*landsting*).
* 50 for local parliament elections (*kommun*).

Bilbao, as any other big city, has numerous music festivals, concerts and almost every event you could find in Madrid or Barcelona. Besides it is not massive in size, so everything is more reachable and has one of the best public transportation systems of the country. Also, nation-wide known museums like the Guggenheim and Alhóndiga.

Donostia/San Sebastián has a very special feeling, while being the most Basque city you could find (where the Basque language is spoken the most), at the same time features a combination of Spanish and French architecture, with important music festivals and events. Donostia is very well known for its food, the Basque cuisine at its very best. 

The Basque Country, and especially the countryside, is very different to what you normally sea in the rest of the country (which is more mediterranean), so even if you don't end up studying here, I'd really recommend you to try to at least make a small visit to these two cities.

""Liberal arts"" comes from more like what a British public school would teach to turn a person into a wonderful conversationist, a perfect dinner guest, a well rounded person, not really that sort of social scientist. So even though of course the current fucked up ultraliberal attitude of Anglo-American universities where they don't teach, they just discuss how they feel about different perspective and crap like that is a post-1968 innovation, even back in more conservative times in the past e.g. a British university would have allowed more subjective opinion and analysis in such matters, while German unis focused on value-free facts.

Putting it differently, Continental Europe has this tradition that either you are dealing with entirely ""fact-free"" literature from Maupassant to Goethe, or ""value-free"" factual science, the British tradition is melting these two into the half-factual but still significantly subjective tradition of ""essayists"" of the John Locke type.

But German (and German-influenced, like my own, Hungarian) cultures are also fucked up a bit by calling everything ""geistlich""  from art to science, from math to religion, i.e. combined everything from rational reason to spiritual soul into a ""Geist"", which can thus only be contrasted with the body.

I mean for an Anglo-cultured person reading Hegel's phenomenology of the Geist the first question would be exactly what part of the human mind are we talking about here: rational mind, instinct, spiritual mind or soul?  And that would be a very proper critical question! Because you just don't use the same part of your brain in the math class, in the church, in the catharsis of music or when designing a bridge.

Basically the word ""Queen"" is changed to ""King"" and any reference to ""her"" is change to ""him.

Fortunately they get around this problem by *always* abbreviating it to HMRC a long with all the other services which start with ""Her Majesty's"". So the written form never changes because it's always just an initialism but the pronunciation changes. It's interesting seeing little references to the reigning monarch around the place.

BTW a German translation of such slips would be ""Klopfzettel"" because they knock on the doors of people and try to talk them into signing one.

Hungary, new system: there will be numbered, certified sheets of papers handed out by the state, to collect many signatures on one sheet, making this black market crap harder, and also it will be illegal to disturb people at home, they can only collect these in public spaces.

However this does not solve the fundamental problem that the data of people is handled by political parties, I mean for basic human rights reasons you really don't want to enable political parties to build databases regarding which people support them, this is just too dangerous and inappropriate.

Si on regarde les conférences d'Asselineau, notamment sur l'euro, il est clair que la disparition du système de taux de change, remplacé par le système Target2, est la cause de [l'écart des balances des paiements](http://www.creditwritedowns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Target2-Net-Balance.gif
).

Les pays n'ont plus la possibilité de faire des remaniements des taux de change de leur monnaie, or comme Asselineau ne cesse de répéter, une monnaie c'est un peuple et une économie, et il est impossible pour 17, bientôt 18 économies qui ont des besoins et des intérêts très différents  d'utiliser une monnaie commune.

Et quand un des pays est frappé par un choc asymétrique (les autres pays ne sont pas victimes de ce même choc), les travaux du Nobel d'économie Robert Mundell disent que toute l'histoire du monde montre qu'il n' y a que 3 manières de résorber ce choc :

1. des mouvements de population des zones touchées par le chômage vers les zones où il n'y en a pas, en admettant qu'elles le veulent et qu'on veuille bien les accueillir (ce qui est faux, les Portugais ne vont pas travailler en Allemagne avec laquelle ils n'ont pas de liens, ils émigrent en masse vers l'Angola),

2. Une harmonisation fiscale, salariale (ce qui n'arrivera pas, car des pays rentre dans l'UE justement pour bénéficier de leur avantage fiscal et/ou salarial),

3. Des transferts financiers massifs vers les zones touchées.

Tout le problème est là, les transferts s'effectuent sans problème entre un même peuple, car il est bâti sur l'Histoire (ça fait 800 ans que les Français se sentent comme tels), or **il n'y a pas de peuple européen**, les Grecs ne se sentent pas Allemands et vice-versa.

Donc quand il s'agit de payer, et c'est l'Allemagne qui paye, celui qui paye décide, et la misère qui frappe les Grecs (et qui va se développer de plus en plus en France) est dûe entre autre au fait qu'on leur impose d'avoir le même comportements sociaux, le même tissu industriel que les Allemands.

Les Grecs ne le peuvent pas, tout comme les Italiens ne peuvent pas devenir des Néerlandais, des Portugais ne peuvent pas devenir des Finlandais. 

Le système n'est pas viable, c'est bien pour ça que l'euro va exploser comme toutes les monnaies supranationales de l'histoire. Nos dirigeants prennent des engagements colossaux dans le dos des peuples, à hauteur de centaines de milliards d'euros pour ""sauver l'euro"" en aidant les Grecs (or on aide les banques internationales qui se sont octroyées des créances sur la Grèce et qui maintenant spéculent sur ces dettes), et tout ça a pu se faire par des artifices politiques et grâce à la parfaite complicité de l'UMP, du PS, des médias et du FN.

Maybe there is a signature requirement to become an official party, but I really don't know about that. Please anyone feel free to correct me.

As I said, this is something I don't know much about; stream sites certainly aren't 1080p. But I hazard a guess that as porn is targeted to lowest common denominator, I don't think bluray porn is yet a thing (I only have one friend who has a bluray station that isn't also a PS3 and my friends tend to be technologically near the bleeding edge).

So better makeup etc. is something that you would aim for channels that aren't based on the internet. 

&gt;how do you refinance that when people expect porn to be free?

As for how costs are covered -- I suspect the stream sites are covered by the ads they show. After all, porn is the most popular thing on the Internet (surprisingly) and if less popular sites like reddit, facebook etc. can make it with ads, so probably can porn stream sites.  Porn mags are probably doing horribly, as is everything related to print. DVD/Bluray will probably follow. 

This is all part of the switch from analog to digital. It's the same discussion we have with TV/Youtube/Netflix, Newspapers/social media etc. I don't claim to have answers but eventually something will be found.

Si sur un point de vue économique, l'Europe est un échec pour tous ceux qui ne sont pas de grosses entreprises, sur l'ensemble des autres points de vue, l'Europe est une formidable réussite : du point de vue culturel, universitaire, humain. Et même sur plein d'autres points que je n'ai pas en tête tout de suite.

Oui il y a des choses à jeter dans l'Europe, mais ce n'est que minoritaire. D'une manière générale, l'idée d'un Parlement européen est formidable. Les nations sont une abératation à l'heure de la modernité, où on essaye de ne plus subir l'évolution de l'Homme au niveau inter-étatiques, mais de marcher ensemble vers une nouvelle vision de l'humanité, entre hommes. Les pays n'ont jamais été plus liés qu'aujourd'hui.

Au delà de ça, l'Europe a permis à l'Allemagne de se redresser après la WW2, a sauvé les pays satellites de l'ex-URSS après leur idiot saut dans le marché qui allait les ruiner, etc etc. L'Europe est économiquement problématique, mais ce n'est pas le cas sur tout les fronts.

The online calculations are usually quite acurate. I'm not 100% sure, which special regulations are in place for foreign workers, but I'll try to explain how it usually works. I'm assuming that you have a regular job (not as a freelancer, contractor or whatever):

1) Krankenkasse is your health insurance:

""gesetzlich"" is the default (mandatory) public insurance. If you don't have a private health insurance and explicitely opt out of the public insurance, that's the option you have to check. (The cost for public insurance is automatically deducted from your monthly salary)

If you do have a private health insurance and explicitely opted out on the public one, ""privat ohne AG-Zuschuss"" means you pay your insurance alone and ""privat mit AG-Zuschuss"" means your employer pays a subsidy (=Zuschuss)

=&gt; If you don't know, your probably ""gesetzlich""

2) If you do have a job and are covered in the public health insurance (see 1), your not ""Vom Krankenkassen-Sonderbeitrag befreit"". (Meaning you have to pay an extra amount of .9% which is not split between you and your employer)

3) That depends on the company and your contract. Usually the amount per year covers everything.

4) You're probably Klasse I

The system is kind of complicated but here is a brief (not completely acurate) overview:

Class I: Default for employees that are not married

Class II: single parents

Class III: option for married employees (the person with the higher income can select this class which reduces his/ her taxes; the other person will then be Class V)

Class IV: default for married employees which did not select Class II/ V

Class V: option for married employees (the person with the lower income can select this Class which rises his/ her taxes; the other person will then be Class III)

Class VI: is for your second (or more) job


Again: There may be additional rules/ laws for foreigners.

TL;DR: **probably**
1: ""gesetzlich""
2: no
3: included
4: 1

1. Free market enthusiast: the government sells spectrum portions at a very high price, making the price of entry so high that only 2 to 4 groups can usually afford this.

2. Free market critic and information theorist: when prices are at a level that is very far above marginal costs, players easily reach a Nash equilibrium where the rational players understand that engaging a price competition is in no one's interest and that no increase of share can offset the costs of lowering the margin. This does not necessarily require an illicit agreement on price fixing, but can happen spontaneously (though illicit agreement DO happen and can be impossible to prove) 

I personally tend to disagree with 1. because the government in this case ensures things that have been proven to not happen in a free IT market: interoperability and extended coverage. Having no governmental regulation in this field would mean letting the spectrum being a jungle: expect jamming, frequencies stolen between operators and an increase in RF pollution. Such a mess, when allowed to happen, usually result in the emergence of an overseeing authority, very similar to what governments do today. In this case, regulation is a shortcut toward the free-market solution that would emerge.

- American culture is about individuals following their individual dreams. The only difference is that the Left is about giving everybody an equal chance to do it, the Right is about leaving people alone, but they both are individualists, thus comparison with European logic makes no sense. America is ""to the right"" from Europe but in an entirely different direction. The great strength of American culture is that this individualism can be very, very productive when people have to have productive dreams like inventing a new product and starting a business. The weakness is that this individualism can be very destructive when people have different kinds of dreams.

- European culture has a more collective basis, for example compulsory military service was a perfectly acceptable reality not so long ago and in some countries still is. Even the very liberal, left-leaning /r/europe does not really against it. Thus today or in the recent past every young man was raised into being a service man, putting the country before himself. The reason we find it normal that the country owes us stuff like healthcare, is largely because we were or our parents or grandparents had this upbrining that you don't live for your own dreams, you have certain duties towards your society, and this is how it pays it back. In the European logic, the Left largely means a more motherly kind of caregiving collectivism, while the Right means a more masculine, military, nationalist oriented conservatism, neither are really individualist. 

Now the reason Europe is more to the left as the US is that we don't have the kind of ""masculine individualism"" tradition the US has, and the ""masculine collectivism"" (militarism) etc. was associated with Nazis/fascism and that went out of fashion after 1945.

Thus the current political landscape. Northwest Europe is largely emasculated and stuck in ""motherly, nice, caring collectivism"", while South and East are often struggling how to regain a bit of political masculinity without becoming a Nazi, the difficulty comes from the fact that individualist masculinity as in capitalism or Libertarianism we don't really know how to do, and collectivist masculinity, well that sounds too much like marching in black shirts again.

Depends on the kind of traffic, number of lanes etc. often we have only 2 lanes of EU motorways, outer lane full of trucks, inner lane people are driving fast, so every km driven is a gut-wrenching stressful one because if you are in the inner lane, you get honked at by fast drivers, if you are in the outer lane, trucks are slow you have to overtake them without getting a fast drive in your ass, and the worst part is when you drive in the inner lane, and overtake a truck and a car stuck behind the truck and you don't know if you overtake both the car will not notice you care about you and cut in front of you and you will have to smash the brakes? 

So it is really stressful to drive here.

Because for the others it is so engrained that they don't notice it anymore, as in, they find it normal thagt are worried whether it is OK to refer to a person or to a group this or that way. The point I am making is that these people are not trying to be nice and considerate, they are _afraid_ what will happen if they refer to a person in a way that is considered maybe offensive. 

It often feels like university educated Americans have a huge social life,  instead of 3-4 close friends more like 100 acquaintances, buddies, and they take liberal / PC values so seriously that people could lose a lot of status for a ""faux pas"", so people care about not being offensive not because of being considerate and nice but also out of fear of public shaming or ridicule.

At least this is my impression for example I see on Reddit that some people, usually Americans use terms like ""misogynist"" in a way that suggests that you should be _afraid_ that someone calls you so.

* Re-establishing a group of friends took more time than I expected. The language barrier was probably partially involved with that.
* The food and wine are so good in France that you'll find you've become a total snob after about a year. You will suffer greatly when travelling home.

It isn't really wrong either, at least not when you're just speaking to other Scandinavians. It's just the name our ancestors gave the place, regardless of what the rest of Europe called it.

I actually like the fact that the Scandinavian languages have different names for things. For some reason it's fun to me, makes things a bit less boring. An example would be Constantinople. In Icelandic (and old Norse) it is called [Mikligarður](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miklagard#Old_Norse). A direct modern translation would be 'Great Garden' but back in the day the meaning was 'Great City'. Of course the actual name wasn't 'Great City', but calling it that makes you understand exactly how the Vikings perceived Constantinople. It was like nothing they had ever seen, the greatest city known to them. So obviously they called it Mikligarður!

In the past Scandinavians often just found their own names for things, without really caring what the rest of the world called them. Another example would be [Garðaríki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar%C3%B0ar%C3%ADki). Simpler examples would be Rússland/Russland and Þýskaland/Tyskland.

Obviously Holland isn't the right name, but it is the name the Scandinavians gave to the area. I see nothing wrong with holding on to that, so long as you actually know the name the Dutch themselves use, and so long as you're OK with calling it 'Netherlands' when a Dutch person gets prefers it over Holland.

Law student here: ""candidate can't"" requirements are still valid, but I don't know why he picked these 5, when there are many more important things.

There is universal principly, called 'incompatibilitas ', which is enforced in all democratic countries (in different forms), but I have no idea why people in this thread are citing various requirements which one must pass to become a member of parliament. You are not working on some thing of school project, this is article about small parties, not 'let's compare unrelated requirements'.

You are working on article about small parties and I support one in Poland and I also have some legal knowledge. The % he stated are correctly, but the problem is much wider and I try to summarize them:

* Poland has bicameral parliament ('broken' bicameralism system), where lower house is elected in public, direct vote. The method of counting votes (for lower house) is d'Hondt method, which naturally favours larger parties. There is a huge movement in poland to change election system, I suggest you to contact them http://jow.pl/kontakt/ . There are cases when a person who is a local activist or an idealist and gets a large amount of votes, but he isn't elected, because he is not a member of major party and he 'lost' hist mandate to a person, who had a laughable amount of votes (but was on party list). I hope you know what d'Hondt method is.

* In Poland parties are largerly subsidized from budget. To receive financial aid party must have given amount of votes in last election, which of course favours parties that are large and currently in the political scene, where smaller parties are run on money given them by members only,

* major news corporations are very friendly to one or other political party. This is not a conspiracy theory, and even Poles don't know about this (because hey, let's bash in vitro for 2 weeks in media): when the party wins an election and form an administration, they start to buy a **massive** amounts of ads/public annoucnemts in newspaper which was favourable to them (currently Gazeta Wyborcza). These ads are complete bullshit, like 'let's make a campaign about modernization of polish agriculture for 20 mln Euro, which all goes to our favourite newspapers'. All parties do that, in 2006/7 ruling party sold public share in second largest (and at the time most professional) newspaper Rzeczpospolita to English company, when they promised them to be 'grateful' in articles (I base those claims on this weekend edition of Wyborcza). The list goes on,

* the public dispute is poor, and people haven't form a democratic society yet, we must give them time and educate them. Voting for a smaller party is a 'waste of vote', and people which aren't leaders of big parties are marginalised. There were many cases in modern history where a group of prominent members of the party formed their own, but both media and society tend to be in favour of leaders and their parties, than actual programs. It's a remain from communism.

Je te mets au défi de trouver quelqu'un qui sait te dire, sans l'aide d'Internet, quels pays sont dans l'UE, sont dans l'UE mais pas dans l'euro, et en dehors de l'UE mais qui utilisent l'euro.

Nos grands-parents savaient qui était le ministre des Affaires étrangères allemand de leur temps, on ne peut pas dire la même chose de nos jours. 

Le continent européen qui s'appauvrit de plus en plus, avec des taux de chômage qu'on n'avait pas vu depuis la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, est progressivement en train de sombrer dans une dictature, il faut se rappeler comment Berlusconi, l'homme aux milles scandales, qui avait résisté à tout, a été renversé lorsqu'il rechignait à appliquer les mesures qui lui étaient dictées par Jean-Claude Trichet, le directeur de la BCE à l'époque. Berlusconi a été remplacé par Mario Monti, élu par personne. Les mesures demandées et appliquées par Monti, le prétendu expert et sauveur, ont été sanctionées par le peuple lorsque Monti n'a réuni que 10% des voix aux élection générales.

Même chose en Grèce, Papandréou s'est fait chassé comme un malpropre après sa tentative de référendum (mesure qui permet un contrôle du peuple sur ses dirigeants) concernant les ""aides"" pour ""sauver"" la Grèce. Les Grecs n'ont pas eu droit à leur référendum et Papandréou a été remplacé par Papademos, élu par personne.

Ce sont littéralement des dictatures qui ont été mises en place à ces moments là.

Quand les Français rejettent à 55% la Constitution européenne, et qu'ils l'ont quand même après qu'elle soit ratifiée par voie parlementaire, c'est un déni de démocratie.

Quand Robert Schuman vote les pleins pouvoirs à Pétain, puis est frappé d'indignité nationale et rendu inéligible, [puis est secrètement financé par la CIA tout comme Jean Monnet pour promouvoir l'Union européenne](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1356047/Euro-federalists-financed-by-US-spy-chiefs.html), puis avoir certains qui le considèrent littéralemet comme un saint (puisqu'un procès en béatification a été ouvert), c'est de la pure propagande.

Il était possible d'avoir une Europe unie [comme De Gaulle l'avait proposé, mais les Allemands l'ont roulé dans la farine](http://www.upr.fr/dossiers-de-fond/de-gaulle-et-l-europe/introduction-3) en préférant devenir les vassaux des Américains plutôt que d'être au côté de la France ou peut-être N°2 derrière elle. C'est d'ailleurs le Conseil de l'Europe, qui n'a rien à voir avec les institutions de l'UE, qui a dénoncé les prisons secrètes de la CIA en Europe, pendant que l'UE avait donné sa langue au chat.

L'Europe a récupéré les pays satellites de l'ex-URSS, mais ils ont rejoint de ce fait l'OTAN, qui n'est en fait que la face militaire de la même médaille,  l'autre face civile étant l'UE, qui mène des guerres néo-coloniales en Irak, en Lybie, en Syrie et qui viole le droit international.

La France en restant de l'UE se coupe des peuples qui contribuent à son rayonnement mondial, en vertu de quoi est-ce qu'elle devrait être obligée, à traers les fonds européens à donner entre 80 et 200 fois plus d'argent à la Lettonie, à la Pologne, qu'au Sénégal ou au Maroc ?

La vérité est que l'UE est raciste sinon racialiste [comme le montre cette pub](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=pub%20raciste%20ue&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCkQtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLk-8sKNasxo&amp;ei=N4b2UZ6jKYr88QTuh4HAAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEHISRXYg4X98TOaWG57XhrVp58rQ&amp;bvm=bv.49784469,d.eWU)  (pas de hiéarchie des races, mais chacune doit se développer dans son coin), et n'est qu'une relique de la Guerre Froide, qui sert aux intérêts géostratégiques des Etats-Unis, et qui transforme tous les pays à l'intérieur en vassaux. 

On en a l'exemple parfait quand les pays ""européens"" ont détourné l'avion du président Morales, l'ont forcé à atterrir pour le fouiller, refusent le droit d'asyle à Edward Snowden mais l'accordent aux Pussy Riots, qui manifestent contre Poutine et les dirigeants ukrainiens alignés sur Moscou au lieu de Washington.

Les Etats-Unis sont intervenus avec toute une série de pays européens en Irak, créant au passage plus d'un million de morts, ruinant ce pays pour des décennies, détruisant tout un patrimoine culturel, pillant les collections du Musée de Bagdag, mettant tout ça sous coupe réglée d'Haliburton et d'autres compagnies américaines, chassant au passage les intérêts français de la Mésopotamie ou nous étions présents par la compagnie française des pétroles depuis les années 30, masi tout ceci est illégal au regard du droit international.

Et la France a sauvé non seulement son honneur en l'espèce, mais aussi un peu l'honneur de l'occident ou du moins du monde blanc vis-à-vis des peuples des autres continents.

Car c'est ça la vocation de la France, au sens d'Asselineau en tout cas, c'est de faire prévaloir le droit international, fusse contre le grand puissant du moment ; la France est le pays des droits de l'Homme, et elle considérée et appréciée comme tel lorsque la France de De Gaulle s'oppose aux Etats-Unis ou au Reich hitlérien, ou à Staline, ou à la guerre en Irak, le monde entier est derrière elle.

Lorsque la France est complètement alignée sur les Etats-Unis comme c'est la cas actuellement, en se vautrant dans l'indignité de Sarkozy ou de Hollande, en Syrie et sur l'affaire Snowden, le monde entier la méprise.

On est bien loin de Charles De Gaulle auquel on réservait un accueil triomphant lors de sa tournée en Amérique latine.

I suspected as much. But I'm fairly sure neither of my parents do (and my late grandparents and great-grandparents didn't, seeing as how I went through their belongings). 

&gt;  There was a humongous porn industry making VHS tapes, and somebody was consuming them

I don't doubt this; but similarly tobacco industry is extremely profitable, and still most people don't smoke. 

&gt; For our generation it is 100%. For the last it was at least around 80%. 

Before using words like ""generation"", you should really define what period of time you mean. The dictionary gives me 30 years, but I've also seen periods of five years to be used. I refuse to believe that the people born in the 1960s (assuming you're 90s kid) consumed porn on that percentage. I was born in the early 80s and let me tell you; most of my class didn't watch porn before adulthood. You kind of needed your personal TV and/or very expensive computer for that (excluding magazines, which were not sold for underage people anyway -- though I remember how I once browsed a magazine at store when I was 14, afraid that somebody would say something..).

Anyway, I'm pretty sure porn wasn't that common in Finland in the 80s. If I recall correctly, everything not deemed suitable for teenagers (and hardcore and most erotica would fit the bill) was banned for public good.

&gt;They'd have to survey a lot of elderly people to get results like 39% in Italy, where people apperently never watched a second of pornography...

The average Italian is 44 years old, says CIA World Factbook. If we assume that nobody under 13 is interested in porn (debatable, but please entertain me), and the average life expendicy is 79, that means that the average person who might be interested in porn is in his 50s (this all having to do with the baby boom of the late 40s and the availability of condoms and epills soon after, making the following generations much smaller). 39% sounds pretty realistic to me.

When the Eastern European countries moved into a market economy, the people lacked the ""antibodies"" and all kinds of villains reached the top. 

State-owned companies and utilities were run by people who wanted to syphon as much money out of them as possible. Since these companies were losing money, the IMF, EU, World Bank, US, etc. suggested privatization as a panacea. The privatizations were usually done (and they're still done, currently, they're privatizing hydro and nuclear plants and railroads) in unfair ways so that someone will win.

Since it's usually a western company that paid the highest bribe (I suppose that's the auction), none of those institutions (IMF, EU, etc) protested; they just vaguely claimed that Romania must do something with its corruption.

&gt; I'm beginning to think that it is important to have a core export base and attempt to create an environment where as many other industries can 'feed' off it as possible.

That's what the Norwegians do. (I'm working for a Norwegian IT company here in Romania)",0,1375112344,null,0,false,0,cbcm0mh,t3_1j9ns4,t1_cbcm0mh,t1_cbckvq4,null,1430124970,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

true,Aksalon,null,null,"I understand that there are other reasons motivating you to go there, but what I would recommend is maybe visiting Madrid (or other touristy places) for a few days, and then spend the bulk of your time in a city with less English.  Of course it's *possible* to more or less avoid English in Madrid, but it'll take dedication and a lot more effort than if you went somewhere else, and you probably won't have a 100% success rate.  You'd have a giant safety net of English and American things that's available whenever you want, which makes it a lot harder to really stick to your plan of immersing yourself in the language and culture.

When I visited Madrid I didn't speak Spanish a single time I was there.  I actually tried to speak Spanish a few times (wasn't sure whether to assume they spoke English or not), and people switched to English on me.  It'll probably be less like that if you get away from the city center, but I don't imagine you'd go to Madrid to sit in some suburban-like area.

Compare that to when I lived in Zaragoza--I can count the number of times I spoke English there on one hand with fingers to spare, and I lived there the better part of a year.  Few English speakers, virtually no English signs, fewer American stores, and a hell of a lot more Spanish.  In Madrid you have to put in the effort and hope your dedication doesn't wane--in Zaragoza you pretty much have to do nothing, you're speaking Spanish whether you feel like it or not.

So I really have to strongly recommend you consider staying in a different city in your case.  There are places with less English that are still decent sized cities, and you'll get a much more Spanish experience all around.  The ones I've been to are Zaragoza (very little English) and Bilbao (a bit more English, but nowhere near as much as Madrid/Barcelona; a little Basque).  If neither of those appeal to you then there are many more cities you can consider.  Also keep in mind that Spain isn't that big and travel is pretty easy, so if you feel the need to go to Madrid every so often it shouldn't be that difficult.",0,1375117367,null,0,false,0,cbcnw0k,t3_1j9xxx,t1_cbcnw0k,t1_cbcmqu7,null,1430124097,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1

The reality is that prior possession of capital makes all the difference. [Please read this for more information.](http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2968.html)

Second of all, let's assume that your claim is true. It's still a question of time. Suppose that Greece keeps reducing its wages. How much time will it take for it to be competitive wrt Germany, assuming that Germany retaliates in kind? Never. Suppose that Germany does not retaliate and allows its wages to inflate a bit. Still, it would take so much time that the domestic market of Greece would implode in the meantime. Here's a quote [from a lecture I submitted a couple of days ago](http://redd.it/1j5pcy):

&gt; For countries like Spain and Italy, with an export share of 25% of GDP, it is absolutely impossible to get out of the slump by cutting wages. That is what we ask the countries to do, beyond the cutting in public expenditure. We're asking them to cut wages to improve their competitiveness. But if you have a gap of 25%, even if in the first 2, 3 years you are able to cut wages by 20%, you will not reach Germany in terms of the absolute level of competitiveness, but you will have destroyed your domestic market fully. 

&gt; This is what has been happening and it is politically infeasible. You cannot destroy your domestic market and tell people ""In 3 years time, if you cut another 20%, then we will reach the level of competitiveness that will get us out of the slump"", without knowing what the surplus country will do, without having any conditionality on the surplus country to accept a massive reduction of their surplus. It's the other way around: Germany defends its surpluses by all means. Even in Brussels, in the Sixpack, they defended their position and they're not even scrutinised, not even analysed, as long as they have 6% of GDP as surplus. Whereas the deficit countries are facing sanctions already at a much lower level. 

&gt; So this does not work, it cannot work, because you're destroying domestic demand in Southern Europe (including France), you're not stimulating domestic demand in Germany so what you get is a slump in overall demand, for the whole of Europe and you get no way out of the problem. If you do it the other way, if you ask the surplus country to do much more for stimulating demand, by letting wage increase in a normal way, by stimulating domestic demand by fiscal policy. If you do it this way, then you have a chance that the Southern European countries get stimuli from these quantitative effects and if at the same time they are going to moderate their wage increases then they are going to improve their competitiveness, not quickly but over a long period of time.

Correct.

&gt;Greece was just following the absurd orders Brussels gave them, the only fault on Greece's half is for the politicians to be foolish enough to listen to them.

But this is just bullshit. 

""Brussels"" didn't give any orders to Spain and Greece. Economic policy before the crisis was very much left to the individual member states.

This is why the economic problems are so different between Spain and Italy and Greece. There was and is no one system at fault and certainly the EU can't take the major blame for the economic failure of Spain. Multiple countries made questionable economic policy (to say it mildly).

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt;  In the U.S. there are also restrictions that make it harder for college students to vote (largely pushed by Republicans trying to get younger, more liberal, voters to not vote).

What exactly do these restrictions look like? I am asking this because when I went to college in Arizona, before every state and national elections, there were booths all over the place getting people to register to vote. I also voted on campus a number of times. I graduated in 2009 so I am not sure if much has changed. But I experienced the polar opposite of restrictions. In fact, the process of registering and voting as a college student was much easier than it is for me to do the same when not in college.

I am not saying you are wrong. It may vary state to state, and I remember some mumblings about a movement to make it harder to register to vote for a college student (i.e. make them register the same way everyone else does, and do not provide special services on campus), but these measures never came to pass.

Neither will budge. Neither will cooperate with the other. As a result, nothing gets done and the voter gets fucked over.

It's not easy to get out of it either: Introducing a third party will hurt the party they are closest aligned to. eg. if the Tea Party would get enough of a base to seperate themselves from the GOP, you'd have a Democrat majority and the two other parties in the minority - it'd be letting the other side win.

And in the meantime, here are citizens of the United States who, despite getting bombarded with propaganda financed by large corporations (because corporations are people and money is free speech), try to gather information, engage in debate and genuinely try to do the right thing. And all they get from their elected officials is the dick.

I didn't mean to be condescending if that's the impression you got... It just makes me genuinely sad and angry that good people are being fucked over like that.

In a nod to tighter relations between Greece and Israel, he said that, “In the last three years, we have seen a dramatic upgrade, a dramatic change in the relations between Israel and Greece, and it is expressed in many ways in the area of defense. There is a lot of cooperation especially between the two navies, the two air forces, tourism – 400 thousand Israelis were here last year, we hope to have half a million this year, a very significant number.”""

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt;Basically attempts to limit same-day registration, registration in general, ID laws, and absentee voting

I don't see how any of these impact young voters more so than other voters. Limiting same-day registration is silly, but anyone who really wants to vote will register earlier. As for ID laws, it is difficult for me to believe that this adversly effects young or minorities. Everytime this comes up on the news, people make a big stink out of it. I think it is overblown since ID's are pretty much necessary for anyone to do anything, and ID's are cheap. You can also request these for free in many states (obviously not driver's licenses, but state ID's). As for absentee voting, once again I think this is overblown. I voted in the last presidential election via an absentee ballot (I was 25, not sure how young you have to be in order to be considered a young voter), and it was painless. Made a phone call, and a few days later I got a package in the mail with the postage paid for to mail in my ballot.

From the link you posted, it doesn't really explain what ""restrictive id laws"" are. I assume they mean ""need a photo id"". It also shows that 41 out of 50 states have passed some sort of similar measure, so I can't draw a republican/democrat divide over that issue. I personally have no problems with needing an ID, and almost every counter argument I have seen is rooted in sensationalism. The only cases I have seen where those laws had adverse effects were related to elderly people that have had their driver's license taken due to safety concerns. That's unfortunate, but there are still ways to acquire an ID if need be.

Honestly, if anyone cares enough about voting, it is simple to do. Same-day registration effects those who waited until the last day, the other restrictions are easy to overcome. I do not see any group targeted more than others besides the lazy.

Like with Christianity, there were Jewish missionaries at one point in time or another (though obviously not to the same extent) who may have converted individuals from different populations and people other than those in the region of the modern State of Israel. Probably very little modern Jews are related the to who lived Israelis around the time of, say, King David. Also, regardless of the origin of the Jews who were in Europe, most of the Jews in Central and Eastern Europe did assimilate with the local populations, so they may have less in common with their historic origin. 

If you take modern British people, it would be a fallacy to say that the average modern British person is the same, ethnically and culturally, as the Britannian tribes who were around at the time of the Roman invasion -- they're been successive invasions and migrations into that region over thousands of years, this led to a patchwork of different cultures merging and assimilating with each other resulting in a brand new culture forming. This same, in fact, would be true for most of Europe. Even in Ireland (which it appears you and I are from), this would have also been the case -- Irish people 2,000 years ago would be completely different, ethnically and culturally, to the modern Irish. 

I don't see why Jewish people would be an exception to this.

&gt;In 1991, the former head of France’s foreign intelligence service admitted that France had spied on US technology companies that competed with French rivals. It was noted, then, that “France has long been among the most aggressive users of espionage to collect foreign industrial and technological secrets” – perhaps second only to Japan. This included allegations of bugged seats on Air France. In 1992, another former CIA director, Stansfield Turner, noted that “the French are the most predatory service in the world now that the old Soviet Union is gone”.

[Or this?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_espionage#France_and_the_United_States)

&gt;Between 1987 and 1989, IBM and Texas Instruments were thought to have been targeted by French spies with the intention of helping France's Groupe Bull.[37] In 1993, US aerospace companies were also thought to have been targeted by French interests.[38] During the early 1990s, France was described as one of the most aggressive pursuers of espionage to garner foreign industrial and technological secrets.[37] France accused the U.S. of attempting to sabotage its high tech industrial base.[37] The government of France has been alleged to have conducted ongoing industrial espionage against American aerodynamics and satellite companies.

And as far as the issue of mass surveillance goes, are Europeans just as outraged about Sweden's [FRA Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRA-law)? Which, to quote, ""authorizes the Swedish Defence Radio Authority to *warrantlessly wiretap all telephone and Internet traffic that crosses Sweden's borders*"". Remember, this includes ALL INFORMATION passing through Sweden. So if you have a e-mail/website that's routed through a Swedish server, if your communicating with or using a company based out of Sweden or make a call that for some reason has to go through Sweden, it's all tracked. And even then, as specified here, *""experts argue both that it is impossible to differentiate between international traffic and traffic between Swedes and that the oversight by SIUN is not effective enough.""*, so it also provides the means, and excuse, for warrentless domestic/international wiretapping. Pretty convenient. 

And where's it stored? The [Titan Traffic Database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_traffic_database). Which is based on the NSA CELL DATABASE! You see the TTR is a database established by the Swedish National Defence Radio Establishment where call detail records (CDRs) of telephone and internet traffic and transaction data (IPDRs) concerning international telecommunications are stored.  

And let us not forget that the Swedes' did such a swell job at this that the United Kingdom are trying their own hand at it with the [Interception Modernisation Programme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception_Modernisation_Programme), with it being widely reported that the IMP's eventual goal is to store details of all UK communications data in a central database, just like the TTR. 

And shall we not forget about the EU-wide [Data Retention Directive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Retention_Directive), which requires that E.U. member states store citizens' telecommunications data for anywhere between 6 to 24 months. Under the directive the police and security agencies will be able to request access to details such as IP address and time of use of every email, phone call and text message sent or received.

And let us not forget [The Netherlands, which spy on 1 in every 1,000 calls](http://amsterdamherald.com/index.php/allnews-list/306-20120523-one-in-1000-dutch-phones-wiretap-interception-police-evidence-gathering) and who have [one of the highest wiretapping rates in all of Europe](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/how_they_do_it/2006/02/wiretapping_europeanstyle.html).

You know... I was raised a Jehovah's Witness. I left when I was 23 (that's five years ago). For 23 years, unbeknownst to me, I had been living in an information bubble, carefully crafted for me by proxy through my parents by people in downtown New York. When I found out I had been lied to, kept in the dark to the point of social retardation, I was angry. The corruption, the coverups, the followers.

I stepped out of that cult bubble and what did I step into? An even bigger bubble of corruption, but this time it's *other* bankers and *other* politicians. It's disgusting. But this time, I feel powerless to stop it.

First of all - hussars were not your typical cavalry. They weren't even your typical heavy cavalry, oh no. They carried two main weapons - polish sword (""szabla"") and a pike, that was some 4,5-6+ meters long.

6 fucking meters. Try to imagine holding such long of a stick, yet it was a pike. 

Other thing to remember was that the hussars started their attack usually well out of any useful ranged weapon of the time. They didn't start the charge in their final formation, but rather in a number of very disperse lines, with a lot of space between horses in front (it usually meant that there was a horse, place for 3 more, and another horse, rinse and repeat), with quite a lot of space between lines, too.

As the charge begun, the lines started moving (pikes upwards), and they started by simply walking. They covered half the distance to their target in such fashion, and then every other line sped up to form one line with the preceding one - now there's horse, space, horse, space, etc. and the lines are twice as sparse. The whole formation speeds up and the horses now run, with the feathers and the armors (which had lots of noise-making loose metal elements) play together with the rumpus made by the horses - the sound of imminent destruction to anyone who stands in their way.

As their goal is nearer and nearer (approximately 1/5th of the initial distance), three things happen:

- every other line level with the preceding one, again. Now there are absolutely no spaces between the horses, and the husars ride literally knee-to-knee
- ALL of them speed up to full gallop
- they now lower (finally) their 6-fucking-meters pikes

picture that. Just try to imagine being in the first line of musketeers that have to face this - you did your very best to shoot one or two of those daemons, but now, as you stand there, there's a motherfucking spiky wall of steel moving at you with some 50 miles per hour - that's some 80 kilometers per hour. Imagine what being hit by a car with that speed does to a human body. And even if you somehow (!) manage not to remain a mangled heap of meat after the first wave passes over you (ok, horses may try to jump sometimes), there are at least 4 more coming within fractions of a second. 

Do you think they'd bother trying very hard aiming those pikes? Hell no. And if you try to run, they'll just slash your back with the swords. And as for what happens after the first charge? There is no second charge. Why waste time? Oh no, the hussars simply find a reasonably empty piece of field (easy to do when everyone runs the fuck for their lives), regroup, replace broken pikes in the first row with good ones from the back, pick their next target, and simply start walking...

=================================================

&gt; I like to believe Europe has changed ever so slightly since the cold war?

Drawing from your first post *(and the quotes above)* that wasn't your main point. Your main point was spying in general by European states, both on each other other and America, which you implied should be ridiculed and how E.U. citizens would be just as outraged. 

&gt;Not one single example of yours is European countries actively spying on US citizens on US soil.

Yes it is. How about the espionage I linked France too? Do you think they were truly capable of accomplishing that without spying on U.S. citizens on U.S. territory? Plus, is the bugging of Air France airplane seats not considered spying on U.S. citizens? And how about France's extensive industrial espionage of Germany? Does that count? Inter-European spying should be just as important and ridiculed in my opinion. 

&gt;What the US does is exactly that. They actively seek out and record data from allied countries, from common folks to politicians, even from the offices of EU officials.

You keep switching up your position. At first spying in general is bad, but than you say it's only bad when America is spying on other countries, not domestic spying.  But European countries do the same thing.

But than you say it's not really that, it's America spying on E.U. citizens that's the problem...but here your criticizing the spying on E.U. institutions and officials....

And before I move on to my next point, let me just remind you that by solely saying this something that America does, you're completely ignoring recently when [Britain spied at the G20](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-spies-at-gchq-spied-on-foreign-politicians-at-g20-summit-meetings-in-london-8661182.html)?

I mean.....arn't those the *most legitimate* and *acceptable* targets? Shouldn't that be encourage in lieu of surveillance of citizens? Are they not the most fair-game of all intelligence targets?  

&gt;Your examples are not espionage. What the US currently does is. Or well, bar the swedes, but they are a pretty shady bunch.

France's industrial espionage of both America and Germany, which to remind you, in Germany's case is more extensive than that conducted by both Russia and China combined, isn't considered espionage? Or Britain's spying during the G20? And why not? 

You said people would react just as strongly if European countries did it. So I ask, where is the same level of outrage against France, Britain or Sweden? 

**EDIT: Also, when you said no European does this to America, let me remind you of Sweden. Any Swedish company that you do business with, any phone call that has to go through Sweden for whatever reason and any internet e-mail/message/website that is based out of a Swedish server. Experts agree that Sweden is unable to tell the difference between international and domestic traffic.

I'd recommend you to watch the documentary [Occupation 101](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jvXnPG9Xc) produced by American and Israeli peace activists, with the participation of many prominent academics. It shows the reality of Israeli policies on the every day lives of ordinary Palestinians, and gives a better understand of the desperation of the Palestinians and their violent reactions to the occupation.

&gt;  Occupation 101 includes interviews with mostly American and Israeli scholars, religious leaders, humanitarian workers, and NGO representatives — more than half of whom are Jewish — who are critical of the injustices and human rights abuses stemming from Israeli policy in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza.

[This map](http://thevoxkashmir.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/israel_palestine-map-edit-1353601538.24.jpg) also provides some perspective. Imagine if that was the country of your people that you could only helplessly watch being consumed like that.

[This map](http://humanprovince.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/m0094.jpg) from the UN provides some perspective on why the Palestinians and Arabs did not want to accept the UN plan in 1947. As you will notice many of the areas that were to be given to Israel had a majority of Arab landholders. Many of those areas now have almost no Arabs living there.

I would also recommend that you watch [this video](http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/witness/2012/04/201243114530739738.html) about the eviction of Palestinians from homes where they have lived for generations, so that Israeli settlers - who are openly racist and very candid about their intentions to boot out Palestinians - can move in.

And on that site, if you read further down it specifies categories for the restrictive bills.

For the elderly it's not just a matter of location.  Tracking down your documents for these people is not necessarily easy to prove citizenship in order to get IDs.  The system was not as well regimented when they were young, hell, even addresses in a lot of places used to be haphazard - corner of x and y, third street past z, etc.  Remember, a lot of people still voting today were born before there were social security numbers too.

For youth it's common sense as well - the more time elapses from the age you are able to begin voting, the more likely someone is to be registered to vote.  Targeting registration adversely affects those people less likely to be registered.  Targeting absentee ballots targets students that are likely to be at school and away from home (it's not easy in every state, and often goes through the local municipality rather than state governments).

You had also had some states specifically targeting early voting based pretty around dates historically used by black churches for voting drives (if this wasn't intentional... it seemed awfully coincidental).

What you really need to look at is why are these changes needed?  Are they needed? Are they arbitrary?  Does someone have something to gain from them? Who is losing out? Who is voting on them.

 [thanks to her family's networks]

&gt;and tipped by some as a future president.

Qui ne l'est pas ? Sylvain V. sera président un jour. Hop, il est tipped by some as a future president.

&gt;And what is all-the-more remarkable about Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet is that she has managed to fight her way through the rampant sexism of French politics.

C'est spur qu'en comparaison de l'Amérique, on est très sexiste, cf war on women et vaginagate. Je rejoins merkozy2012 : ""si ça n'avait pas été la misogynie, ils auraient trouvé autre chose, la misogynie est juste l'attaque la plus facile.""

&gt;She was twice told by two of her own party’s leaders that she’d missed out on becoming a government minister because she was pregnant.

Elle état ministre sous Fillon, non ? [Le Monde précise que la deuxième fois, c'étiait Fillon]

&gt;She said politicians who claimed to be “little teddy bears” were not being truthful. “Liar one day, liar every day.”

Gotcha, elle ment tout le temps donc.

&gt;Kosciusko-Morizet is a fan of the United States, saying it’s a “perpetual source of inspiration.” 

Please, no.

&gt;Bacharan said Kosciusko-Morizet and Hidalgo, currently deputy mayor, were “physically attractive, beautiful women”

The reason we have the EU is mainly because some problems cannot be solved by each individual european state alone. Now that the EU becomes something bigger, I can completely understand if countries want to drop out. I for my part do not care about national sovereignty of Germany at all, and it breaks my heart that the UK does not want to be part of the Schengen Area. :(

&gt; According to Huntington, the West is distinguished from Orthodox Christian countries by the experience of the Renaissance, Reformation, the Enlightenment, overseas colonialism rather than contiguous expansion and colonialism, and a recent re-infusion of Classical culture through Rome rather than through the continuous trajectory of the Byzantine Empire.
&gt; 
&gt; The differences among the modern Slavic states can still be seen today. This issue is also linked to the ""universalizing factor"" exhibited in some civilizations[clarification needed].
&gt;
&gt; Huntington refers to countries that are seeking to affiliate with another civilization as ""torn countries."" Turkey, whose political leadership has systematically tried to Westernize the country since the 1920s, is his chief example. Turkey's history, culture, and traditions are derived from Islamic civilization, but Turkey's elite, beginning with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk who took power as first President of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, imposed western institutions and dress, embraced the Latin alphabet, joined NATO, and is seeking to join the European Union.
&gt;
&gt; Mexico and Russia are also considered to be torn by Huntington. He also gives the example of Australia as a country torn between its Western civilizational heritage and its growing economic engagement with Asia.
&gt;
&gt; According to Huntington, a torn country must meet three requirements to redefine its civilizational identity. Its political and economic elite must support the move. Second, the public must be willing to accept the redefinition. Third, the elites of the civilization that the torn country is trying to join must accept the country.",0,1375130740,null,0,false,0,cbctcgo,t3_1ja4bu,t1_cbctcgo,t1_cbct4mo,null,1430121416,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

More to the point, how is correctly stating that Turkey and it's Ottoman heritage are majoritarily non-European both hateful and racist? Is it bad not to be European? Should everyone be European in your mindset? Or, more to the point, should the European identity be so diluted that anyone can be European? There is no value judgement in what I'm saying, definitely no hate, only love for my European heritage and respect for other cultures, neither of which I wish to see uniformized or diluted beyond recognition.

I'm well aware that due to its proximity to Greece, small parts of Turkey (mainly the tiny European part West of the Bosphorus Strait) are influenced as much by European civilization as by its Ottoman heritage.

This means less support for European defense, NATO-exclusive operations and European interventions such as Libya and Mali. This is even more disturbing when taking into account that only 5 out 28 members *(the U.K., France, Greece, Albania, and the U.S.)* of NATO actually meet the 2% of their GDP requirement for military funding. 

As America shifts it's global strategy and military positioning in the coming century, more and more responsibility will be placed on the U.K.'s and France's shoulders as it's divested from ours.

true,kamzikowy,null,null,"Poland in the Second World War

There are still those among us, admittedly very few, who think that Germans placed their death camps in occupied Poland for some reason other than transportation. It is a well known 1941 letter from the Reichsfűhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler to the commandant of the Konzentrationslager Auschwitz (Oświęcim) which stated: ""I selected for this reason [extermination of the Jews] the town of Oświęcim due to its isolation and convenience for transportation purposes."" This and other death camps placed in German occupied Poland served as extermination points for Jews, Gypsies, Russians and Poles. 

Poland was the first country to resist Hitler's march across Europe, despite lack of promised by an international treaty military help from the Western powers. Poland has never produced a traitor collaborating with occupation forces. Most countries did. There were Petain and Laval in France, Tiso in Slovakia, Degrell in Belgium, Quisling in Norway, Wlasow in Russia, Clausen in Denmark, Mussert in Holland and others. The SS raised a volunteer military and police units from numerous nationalities: Albanians, Bosnians, Bulgarians, Croatians, Belgians, Dutch, Finns, Norwegians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Hungarians, French, Russians, Cossacks and others. There was no Polish volunteer unit serving in the SS. Any Poles serving in German armed forces were forced to join and did not volunteer. Poland always regarded Nazi Germany as a prime enemy and stayed with the Allies until the end of the Second World War.

The price of this invariable stance was the highest paid among waring nations. Poland lost 6,028,000 of its pre-war citizens, half of them Jewish. Only 123,000 combatants were killed in action, that is 2% of all who died. Another 521,000 civilians were killed due to military operations. The Nazis exterminated 5,384,000 citizens of Poland of all nationalities and religions. Altogether 17% (that is one in six) of the population perished in the war. Every family lost at least one of its members in the war. The list of losses is much longer, for example: Poland suffered 590,000 amputees, 1,140,000 cases of tuberculosis, 2,460,000 Poles was deported to Germany as laborers, the list goes on and on. Just for comparison, the city of Warsaw lost approximately 900,000 inhabitants, while the USA fighting on all fronts of the war for 4 years lost 405,400 soldiers- the comparison speaks for itself.

Polish armed forces fought Germans from September 1, 1939 until May 8, 1945 on all fronts. Soldiers took part in campaigns in Poland, France, Norway, in the Battle of England, Battle of the Atlantic, African and Italian campaigns, Belgium, Holland, Soviet Union, Germany and there were even some Polish pilots fighting Japanese in the Far East. 1,500,000 soldiers defended Poland in September 1939, 200,000 joined the Allies in the West, the Home Army counted 600,000 combatants and innumerable co-conspirators, and some 400,000 joined the 1 and 2 Armies formed by the Soviets. The war effort was unlike any other country of the anti-German coalition. 

After all that, Americans, British and Soviets partitioned Poland again in Jalta and signed off 48% of its territory to the Soviet Union, allowed installation of the Soviet puppet government in Warsaw and declared total disinterest in the affairs of Central Europe. The real end of the Second World War for Poland came in 1989 when the last of the Soviet troops left the country.

As to the Polish - Jewish relation during the Second World War consider this: of the 17,000 medals ""Righteous Among the Nations"" for saving Jews during the Holocaust granted by the Yad Vashem Institute in Israel as much as 5632 of the total number of 19,141 (over 29%) is held by Polish citizens.

If I said that, I must not have chosen my words carefully. The booths were there for a month running up to the final day. So they were registering same day voters on the final day, but you could have registered for an entire month before that.

&gt;You had also had some states specifically targeting early voting based pretty around dates historically used by black churches for voting drives (if this wasn't intentional... it seemed awfully coincidental).

I believe either the US attorney general, or the supreme court has a list of states that are forbidden from modifying their voting requirements for this reason. Most of these (actually, all of them) states are in the south. It's kind of sad that those states still have a watchdog to prevent them from shenanigans, but I guess they deserve it.

This part of your text is the crux of the problem though:
&gt;What you really need to look at is why are these changes needed? Are they needed? Are they arbitrary? Does someone have something to gain from them? Who is losing out? Who is voting on them.

You are right in that those are the key questions to ask, but not everyone would answer the same way, and a lot of the reasons people have are personal convictions that are not easily changed, nor is anyone specifically right or wrong.

Anyway, there is an interesting debate to be had with all this. I actually had to check the thread we were in because of how off an a tangent you and I have gone.

I believe America and NATO member states should divert to a Mutual Defense Pact instead of the bureaucracy that NATO has become. I would be even more in favor of the complete abolishment of NATO and it's supplementation by a Mutual Defense Pact solely between the U.S. and the EU. 

NATO, in it's current form, has covered Europe in a American security blanket. This has led to the underspending we see in European countries and their presently weak military infrastructure, thus allowing them to rely solely on America, France and the United Kingdom for all defensive, security and military needs. During the Cold War, this was necessary with the Fulda Gap and all, but in the modern era, not so much. This is evidenced by my country's *""pivot to the pacific""*. 

Personally I believe that the de-institutionalization of NATO, along with my country's already under way shift to the Pacific Region *(and away from it's Europe-bound Cold War strategy)* will provide the motivation for a common European military and shared defensive responsibility *(as in military spending being increased so it's more fair and proportional across all E.U. states)*. If not for any other reason, but necessity. Hopefully. Although the de-institutionalization is a far-fetched and abstract dream, so Europe might just be doomed to the status quo.

It might be odd, that as an American, I'm suggesting what appears to be the diminishing of my country's influence, but I think it'll be a lot more beneficial for both of us in the long-term. What my country needs at the moment more than strong influence is strong allies.

There are still those among us, admittedly very few, who think that Germans placed their death camps in occupied Poland for some reason other than transportation. It is a well known 1941 letter from the Reichsfűhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler to the commandant of the Konzentrationslager Auschwitz (Oświęcim) which stated: ""I selected for this reason [extermination of the Jews] the town of Oświęcim due to its isolation and convenience for transportation purposes."" This and other death camps placed in German occupied Poland served as extermination points for Jews, Gypsies, Russians and Poles. 

Poland was the first country to resist Hitler's march across Europe, despite lack of promised by an international treaty military help from the Western powers. Poland has never produced a traitor collaborating with occupation forces. Most countries did. There were Petain and Laval in France, Tiso in Slovakia, Degrell in Belgium, Quisling in Norway, Wlasow in Russia, Clausen in Denmark, Mussert in Holland and others. Poland always regarded Nazi Germany as a prime enemy and stayed with the Allies until the end of the Second World War.

The price of this invariable stance was the highest paid among waring nations. Poland lost 6,028,000 of its pre-war citizens, half of them Jewish. Only 123,000 combatants were killed in action, that is 2% of all who died. Another 521,000 civilians were killed due to military operations. The Nazis exterminated 5,384,000 citizens of Poland of all nationalities and religions. Altogether 17% (that is one in six) of the population perished in the war. Every family lost at least one of its members in the war. The list of losses is much longer, for example: Poland suffered 590,000 amputees, 1,140,000 cases of tuberculosis, 2,460,000 Poles was deported to Germany as slave laborers, the list goes on and on. Just for comparison, the city of Warsaw lost approximately 900,000 inhabitants, while the USA fighting on all fronts of the war for 4 years lost 405,400 soldiers- the comparison speaks for itself.

Polish armed forces fought Germans from September 1, 1939 until May 8, 1945 on all fronts. Soldiers took part in campaigns in Poland, France, Norway, in the Battle of England, Battle of the Atlantic, African and Italian campaigns, Belgium, Holland, Soviet Union, Germany and there were even some Polish pilots fighting Japanese in the Far East. 1,500,000 soldiers defended Poland in September 1939, 200,000 joined the Allies in the West, the Home Army counted 600,000 combatants and innumerable co-conspirators, and some 400,000 joined the 1 and 2 Armies formed by the Soviets. The war effort was unlike any other country of the anti-German coalition. 

After all that, Americans, British and Soviets partitioned Poland again in Jalta and signed off 48% of its territory to the Soviet Union, allowed installation of the Soviet puppet government in Warsaw and declared total disinterest in the affairs of Central Europe. The real end of the Second World War for Poland came in 1992 when the last of the Soviet troops left the country.

As to the Polish - Jewish relation during the Second World War consider this: of the 17,000 medals ""Righteous Among the Nations"" for saving Jews during the Holocaust granted by the Yad Vashem Institute in Israel as much as 5632 of the total number of 19,141 (over 29%) is held by Polish citizens.

Even if the motivations are those that you state, such a move would at best incompetent and at worse plain stupid. Not to mention it would unravel the diplomatic and political work that's gone into the E.U. since the 1950s in a matter of weeks. 

You also fail to realize that such a plan **is capable of being undertaken peacefully and with the acknowledgement and consent of individual E.U. countries.** Groundwork has already been put into place with the standardization of NATO member militaries, the implementation of [E.U. Battlegroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_Battlegroup), the coordination between the ISAF in Afghanistan and the successful cooperation between countries in Libya. There is no reason why such a large and fundamental change would have to be rushed and forced, instead of gradual and accepted.

As for your other concerns, what about situations like the Balkan Conflict? Such as the [Srebrenica Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre)? In which thousands of innocent people, many children, were openly slaughtered even though Dutch peacekeepers were in the area and has suspicions of what was happening, with one of the main reasons for this failure being the lack of coordination and integration between the European peacekeepers that were sent to stop such a thing *(I.E. communication to know when to intervene and not intervene)*? This of course led to Kosovo and my own country's involvement, which once again dug my country even deeper into European affairs and increased it's influence over your own countries even more.

And how about European operations such as those in Mali *(coincidentally, Niger is Mali's neighbor, and Niger provides most of France's uranium for it's nuclear power plant, which powers most of the region, so Europe's energy security is a concern in this case)* and Libya? Where European powers had to request my country's logistical and intelligence support? Does it not make you feel slightly uncomfortable knowing that Europe and it's countries are so far incapable of even *regional* power projection that they must use my own country as a crutch? 

Like it or not, Europe is bordered by Africa and the Middle East, two regions who arn't the most stable in the world. You have ethnic tensions in the Balkans that might need interventions to stop a outright spiral towards genocide and ethnic massacres. You have a ever-present Russia which still needs to be deterred given the fact that it considers many Eastern European states of the E.U. to still be in it's sphere of influence. 

You complain about U.S. influence, but make no move to reduce it. Don't you see by handicapping the European militaries and forcing them to rely on my own country, you only increase my country's influence over you? Or is this lost upon you?

Zionism advocates the establishment of Israel in the Holy Land (ie. where today's Israel is). If you're an anti-Zionist, then you advocate... the destruction of Israel and the ""disappearance"" of its population?

&gt; Israeli expansion into Palestinian territories

uninhabited desert

&gt; It threatens all of our safety.

It most certainly doesn't threaten my safety.

&gt; It mocks the UN

The UN has more Arab member states than Israeli member states. If we would allow for the rule of majority then I guess your anti-zionist dreams would quickly become true and we could have a nice final solution for the Jews. But luckily, the founders of the UN were wiser than that and added veto votes to a few states. The Arab dictatorships need to redirect their people's rage at an outside enemy and Israel is like the Christmas tree. They can claim that there's nothing they can do cause America is preventing them from doing it, so they stay in power forever and even get some naive European sympathizers. The Palestinians in Israel had the choice of staying in Israel and share the state with the Jews, instead they decided to fight in an all-or-nothing war, and they lost. After that, they moved over to Jordan from where they launched attacks and convinced the other Arabs to hate the Jews too. However, after some time the Palestinians decided they don't like the Jordanian king and tried to depose him, so the Jordanian king had to expel them. The Palestinians then went to Lebanon where the Muslims were a relative minority, and turned that country into a civil war hellhole which today has a Muslim majority.

Some questions:

1. when will Jordan stop the occupation of Palestinian territories      
2. when will the Palestinians stop the occupation of Lebanese territories      
3. why don't they all just get a job instead of living in refugee camps for 50 years (and who finances those camps anyway?)

&gt; look I know we've been bad... but we're not the only one

As long as the EU takes it in the ass from the US and Russia I don't care what Israel is doing. The Jews are a too easy target, which is why pussy Europeans are hating them.

The rate Greece is paying is what the countries that provide the bailout funds have to pay themselves, plus something like 0.5% or so.

Beautiful pituresque litte towns all along the Rhine river. A must see, in my eyes.


**Re Driving:**
On the Autobahn always stay on the right most lane when possible. Meaning, It's cool to go on the fast lane, but once you've passed your ""target"" move back to the right. For someone who is not used to the Autobahn I'd rather suggest to find someone who's travelling at your desired speed and just stay behind him at a safe distance. Autobahn means war! It's high stress, and fast paced. Always keep an eye on rear view mirrow. 
You might think you are beating some kind of record going 80 mph, when someone just plows by going 150 mph or more...


The ""no right on red"" has been mentioned already. Apart from that, the most important rule is ""*whoever comes from the right, has the right of way*"". Which means, at intersections that aren't governed by signs (Yield/Stop), if someone comes from your right, you **must** let him pass. There are no 4-way stop signs here.

Also, keep your passport on you when you are driving around. There are no borders within the EU. So taking a wrong turn or exit might place you within a different country. You wouldn't want to be pulled over, with your passport in the hotel safe in Cologne. I'd imagine they wouldn't make much of a deal about it, but technically you'd still have crossed international borders without valid ID. 

Language wise you should be golden. Pretty much everyone below 60 speaks reasonable english here (albeit with more or less terrible accents :) ). But do be advised that some american english terms might get some startled looks, since british english is what's taught in schools here (the word ""napkin"" comes to mind).

NATO and the United States' Europe-focused Cold War strategy has put Europe under a security blanket. Hence why only 5 NATO members *(the U.K., France, Greece, Albania, and the U.S.)* actually meet the 2% of their GDP requirement for military funding.

This has led to pushing the majority of militarily responsibility for Europe onto the shoulders of America, the United Kingdom and France. Mali, Kosovo and Libya are prime examples of this. And even in those cases, both France and the United Kingdom, the two countries that ARE supposed to be capable of independent operations, STILL NEEDED my country's support logistical and intelligence support, not even mentioning the direct combat support we provided in Libya. 

And as my country continues it's ""pivot towards the Pacific"", with 60% of our navy and airforce going with it, more and more of Europe's military burden will be placed on the U.K. and France's shoulders, even though their barely maintaining as it is. Is this truly fair? 

And questions of fairness aside, is it truly a good idea to concentrate the majority of the E.U.'s military power into the hands of only two member states? 

&gt;Would it be compulsory for neutral countries to give their neutrality up or can they have a different agreement for peacekeeping etc and none offensive operations?

Personally, I don't think it would be a good idea. It would be unfair to the other countries, just as it is unfair now for France and the United Kingdom. In my opinion, a European Military would need to be just that, a *European* military, no ifs, ands or buts about it. They might not have to deploy their own independent formations, but they should still have to pay a tax to fund such a organization, and to allow their citizens to volunteer in such. Otherwise I think any military would be ineffective if it wasn't set up like this. ",0,1375138523,null,0,false,0,cbcwdt5,t3_1javu0,t1_cbcwdt5,t1_cbcw2bi,null,1430119998,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

[France and Germany call for closer EU military cooperation](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10205537/France-and-Germany-call-for-closer-EU-military-cooperation.html)

Alright, to start off, let me begin with the Cold War. For the past half-a-century, Europe has basically been under the security blanket of the United States. Due to America's strong commitment to Europe, and it's membership in NATO, Europe has been able to rely on the American military for almost any and all concerns. The two big exceptions being the United Kingdom and France, who continued to maintain their military capabilities and the ability to project power around the globe. 

This is the direct cause behind why only 5 out 28 NATO members *(the U.K., France, Greece, Albania, and the U.S.)* actually meet the 2% of their GDP requirement for military funding. The downside of this can be seen the Libya, Mali and Kosovo campaigns, where European militaries needed extensive U.S. logistical, intelligence and at times, combat support. This, in turn, has led to my country having EVEN MORE influence over your countries, something that not many people are keen on or happy about. 

But the thing is, the world is shifting. We are slowly moving from a world in which the United States is the only super power and capable of maintaining a global hegemony, to a multi-polar world in which we are just one in a list of many great powers. This means we can't be the aforementioned ""World Police"" that we are so joyously mocked for. 

This can be evidenced by my country's *""Pivot to the Pacific""*, in which 60% of America's airforce and navy will be stated in the pacific region. This means less forces in Europe, and less forces to help operations that are in European interests. 

You may say ""*But this doesn't matter! I am a pacifist country in a pacifist Europe! No military is a good military I say!*"", at which point, I have to respectfully disagree. Africa and the Middle East directly border Europe, and I remind you, they are not the two most stable regions in the world. And the Balkans, always simmering with ethnic tension, always poses the possibility that peacekeeping intervention will be needed to stop genocide and ethnic cleansings from taking place. And in my opinion, a united European military is especially needed in this regard so a mistake like the Srebrenica Massacre isn't repeated. And we shouldn't forget that the E.U. still needs to deter Mother Russia, ever omnipresent on Europe's border, eyeing the E.U.'s new Eastern European members who she still considers to be in her sphere of influence. And going back to Africa and the Middle East, refugee crises, terrorist hotspots and genocides arn't the only thing you got to worry about. Most of Europe's oil comes from the Middle East, most of it's uranium comes from North Africa. These resources power the majority of the continent. It's a energy security problem as well. 

Right now, France, the United Kingdom and my country have handled all of the above, ala Libya and Mali. Yet, both France and the United Kingdom, the two countries that ARE supposed to be capable of independent operations, STILL NEED my country's support logistical and intelligence support, not even mentioning the direct combat support we provided. And as my country continues it's ""pivot towards the Pacific"", with 60% of our navy and airforce going with it, more and more of Europe's military burden will be placed on the U.K. and France's shoulders, even though their barely maintaining as it is. Is this truly fair? And questions of fairness aside, is it truly a good idea to concentrate the majority of the E.U.'s military power into the hands of only two member states?

Plus, in my opinion, besides all those reasons in the above paragraph, a European Union military would free many of your countries from own country's influence. I see so much bitching about America's influence and bullying, and most of it's justified, which is why a united European military would be so important. It takes the influence of my country away, influence is possesses because of your countries' reliance on my own in the arena of military affairs. 

And I think a common European military could be accomplished, or at least motivated to be accomplished, through two moves. One, already underway, is our pivot to the Pacific region, and the other being the de-institutionalization of NATO. I believe America and NATO member states should divert to a Mutual Defense Pact instead of the bureaucracy that NATO has become. I would be even more in favor of the complete abolishment of NATO and it's supplementation by a Mutual Defense Pact solely between the U.S. and the EU. NATO, in it's current form, has covered Europe in a American security blanket. This has led to the underspending we see in European countries and their presently weak military infrastructure, thus allowing them to rely solely on America, France and the United Kingdom for all defensive, security and military needs. 

The pivot to the Pacific, and the de-institutionalization of NATO, will, in my opinion, provide the motivation for a common European military and shared defensive responsibility *(as in military spending being increased so it's more fair and proportional across all E.U. states)*. If not for any other reason, but necessity. 

Groundwork has been laid for this to work. The E.U. Battlegroups are already in place and standardization among NATO members have streamlined the militaries and made military cooperation tons easier. The only problem is a common language, which I believe should be English, given it's proliferation and use across Europe. While I know France would fight something like this tooth and nail, it's the most practical choice.   

It might be odd, that as an American, I'm suggesting what appears to be the diminishing of my country's influence, but I think it'll be a lot more beneficial for both of us in the long-term. What my country needs at the moment more than strong influence is strong allies. And this would force Europe to unite and act more cohesive, and a united, cohesive Europe means a stronger, more influential Western bloc, which I personally feel is instrumental in both our country's/union's welfare in the coming ""Asian Century"" as it's been dubbed.",0,1375141813,null,0,1375151033,0,cbcxkdq,t3_1javu0,t1_cbcxkdq,t3_1javu0,null,1430119447,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The second point was a predominantly moral one, true, but I raised it only because the entire concept of ""recklessness"" is moral in nature.

No, I don't believe investment decisions should be made based on moral grounds. While it may seem good and benevolent on the outset, it soon turns out to be counterproductive because it is inefficient and therefore damaging to the economy.

My point is more subtle. Capitalism evolves around the idea that people acting in their rational self-interest benefits the society as a whole in the long run. Altruism is desirable in individual cases but any system that *relies* on altruism to work is doomed to failure. At its best, capitalism harnesses people's natural tendency to act on self-interest and makes it benefit society as a whole.",0,1375141851,null,0,false,0,cbcxkuw,t3_1j9ns4,t1_cbcxkuw,t1_cbcwuzq,null,1430119441,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,damn_romanians,ROMA,Romania,"As a person who has been living in Germany and learning German for the better part of the last two years, I will detail my experience here and hopefully help you.


- First ""pro tip"": music. Turns out things stick to your head much better when they come in the form of a pleasant tune. Also, the fact that you're likely to listen to a song more than once helps the words root in your mind. It's just like sex: great exercise that's actually fun doing. Also, movies help. However, unlike /u/L14QU, I would strongly advise against disabling subtitles. Without some form of understanding of what's being said, it's just noise in a foreign language. And this also applies to the music tip I gave you before. I joke about when I say that, without Rammstein, I could never speak half the German I do, but also the fact that I was lucky enough to find [a site that translates the songs](http://herzeleid.com/) extremely well(with side notes as well). Find translations.


- Second pro tip: grammar. Yes, even Wikipedia helps in this case. Don't just learn words and reproduce them later. Unless you're a 10 month-old baby, chances are you won't be getting very far. Learn what nouns, adjectives, pronouns, verbs, cases, inflection etc. are and put them to good use. In my case, it was the only way to deal with the German language's extremely complicated adjective ending system. This is extremely important to anybody(and even more to you) as you are a native English speaker, a language that has lost (or never had to begin with, i don't know) most of its structure. Check out [www.aboutgerman.net](http://www.aboutgerman.net/) forum, they have a lot of people with knowledge of grammar who are more than willing to help explain why certain things are said the way they are.


- Third pro tip, and this will annoy some natives: Do not expect natives to be of any help(at first), because they won't be. First of all, the way they speak is hard to comprehend by a non-native(in Romanian we have a saying about this kind of speaking: it's like they had plums in the mouth). Second of all, while they know the language by heart, the great majority do not really have grammar knowledge. Ask a person why a thing is like this or like that and they will probably not have a good answer to it. That won't be of any use at first, unless all you are planning to do is recite phrases you heard somewhere else without being able to make connections. At later stages, when you have enough knowledge of grammar, it will come in handy as they can easily point mistakes and you will be able to understand **why**.


- Fourth pro tip: never give up. German is not that hard, no matter what people think or say. Sure, it's annoying, sometimes, to see certain perks in the language itself, but just remember, English is not that easy to speak **properly** either. And thank your lucky stars you don't have to learn a language like Romanian or Russian, because those are **really** hard to get a hold of.


- Lastly, after you get a hold of the basics, try to interact with natives or other people that know the language. Contrary to popular belief, most Germans are extremely friendly and more than willing to help and put up with 2 hours of you saying variations of ""Ich bin Kartoffel"".


P.S. [This](http://dict.tu-chemnitz.de/) is your BFF. [This](http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/cgi-bin/gremple) comes second, [this](http://translate.google.com/#de|en|) comes third. Also, [this piece of software](http://www.wartoft.nu/software/selingua/) is a nice thing to have, since it makes learning the language into a game, and is actually fun and catchy. Hope I helped.

At the moment, most of Europe's military responsibility is taken care of by America, France and the United Kingdom. This is changing however, with my country's ""Pivot to the Pacific"", resulting in more and more burden being placed on the shoulders of both Britain and France. 

They can't do it themselves. This is evidenced by both Libya and Mali, where my country had to provide extensive logistical and intelligence support, not mentioning the combat support we provided in Libya. 

This is not fair to France or the United Kingdom. And on top of it, if you keep the status quo, is it really a good idea to concentrate the majority of the E.U.'s military power into the hands of only two members? 

In my opinion, a common European military would alleviate and solve these problems. ",0,1375142424,null,0,false,0,cbcxsbo,t3_1javu0,t1_cbcxsbo,t1_cbcx68d,null,1430119344,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4
