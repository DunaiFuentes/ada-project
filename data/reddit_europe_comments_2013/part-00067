true,Ian_Dess,SERB,GLORIOUS GALACTIC EMPIRE,"I've been in lots of European cities and i've noticed one specific thing that causes me to feel 'sad' like you are describing. In most of major cities, after 9pm or so, streets get so empty. Only drug dealers and some homeless people are out. Worst was in Prague, yeah it was a working day, but i was out in the street at about 9:30 in the downtown and all i've seen is hobos and 'suspicious' types. 

Maybe i'm too used to my country. Despite the popular belief, here (in Serbia) people don't run around in the streets with RPG launchers. Streets are usually crowded, especially in the summer, lots of people just hanging out until late night. Families with children passing by etc. I can take a 5-6km walk from down town to my house at 1 AM and 99% of the time i feel safe and i am not alone on the street. People passing by, going places etc.

And during the day, every day, all cafes are full and streets are full. Yes, that's because unemployment is high and people are lazy, but it has it's upsides too :P

Maybe it's just the 'fear of the unknown', but i find that really depressing about some big cities. 

I can recommend Greece or Italy, some nice city by the sea, i think that you will feel much happier.

Catalonia is a bigger timebomb than Cyprus
BY:MATTHEW PARRIS From: The Times April 08, 2013 12:00AM

THE scene is almost science fiction. Not the gee-whiz optimism of a shiny world to come, but more Blade Runner: a dystopian sense of ambition that overreached itself.

I begin this column from the new terminal of Barcelona's international airport. It is an absolutely beautiful building. And there is absolutely no use for it. So vast and so empty is this brilliantly lit cavern that the security guards speed noiselessly by on two-wheeled Segway machines: smartly uniformed; betruncheoned; bolt upright; vigilant for nothing.

The place is a symbol. A white elephant in the room if ever there was one. It was meant to be a showcase for Catalonia's future as an independent nation. Instead it has become a symbol for over-ambition, political and economic, in the region that now has bigger debts than any other part of Spain. Even before the world economic crisis there was never a business case for massive international airport expansion at Barcelona. Madrid's Barajas airport too has overreached itself, and Barcelona has been playing an anything-you-can-do-we-can-do-better catch-up game. The real rationale behind Catalonia's airport upgrade was to show it is a proper country.


Or ""region"", as the right-of-centre government in Madrid wants Catalans to see their land. The situation is heading fast for deadlock. Forget Cyprus: among Europe's small nations it is Catalonia that could bring the European project tumbling down. Nowhere depends on Cyprus, but the integrity of Spain and the credibility of the Spanish economy depend on Catalonia: on whether Madrid and Barcelona can manage their differences. A disorderly secession would devastate the whole Iberian peninsula, from Portugal to the Basque Country.

I am returning from rural Catalonia, where it seems that almost every second house flies the new banner of Catalan separatism: a Cuban-style flag with a star in a triangle and the four red stripes of the nation's ancient crest. My family here are almost all Catalanista now. Talking to them and their friends and relations in Catalonia, and seeing the slogans daubed on walls, you would get the impression that the whole people (for Catalans are undoubtedly a people, with a language and history of their own) are solid for independence and will vote that way in the referendum that the regional government is tripping over itself to promise for next year: ideally, they hope, on the same day as Scotland's.

Yet talk to The Times's correspondent in Spain, Graham Keeley, and you get a more ambiguous picture. ""In our part of the country,"" I told him, ""anyone who's against independence would feel they were in a tiny minority, and pipe down.""

""Exactly,"" he said. Graham encounters very private doubts among urban middle-class Catalans, and wonders how - in the quiet of the polling station rather than the noise of street demos against whatever is the latest snub from Madrid - the cautious typical Catalan elector would actually vote. Nobody knows.

What polling there is can be read two ways. In June 2005, the earliest record available, only 13.6 per cent wanted independence. Those opting for independence have increased from 24.5 per cent two years ago, to 46.4 per cent in the most recent survey. But the numbers have been levelling off. Whether this cooling is caused by the approach of a referendum, or by unease at the dysfunctionality of the ""coalition from hell"" that now governs Catalonia, it is possible to conclude that pushing the numbers much above 50 per cent may prove problematic.

One encounters a curious naivety about independence here. It has yet to dawn on many that Scotland (whose separatists many Catalans associate with) will probably vote ""no"". They look surprised, even dismayed, when one points out that acceptance of a new, sovereign Catalan state by the international community would not be straightforward; that membership of the EU would not be automatic; that there would be huge resistance (especially from France and Belgium) to the precedent, while whatever trading relationship was finally agreed might be pretty ungenerous; and that there would be sulphurous rows about the apportioning of Catalonia's share of Spanish debt. I'm not sure how far all this has sunk in.

And arising perhaps from a small-nation resentment of a boss-nation's dominance, separatists do not strike me as having understood the terrible vulnerability to them of the rest of Spain. What would any impression of disintegration do to bond prices? What would it do to inward investment? Does Catalonia - one of Spain's richest and most productive regions - understand that if its largest trading partner should sink, so would Catalonia?

The damage Catalan separatism could do to what would be left of Spain is at the same time an argument against separatism and a potentially lethal weapon in the hands of separatists. But it's the ultimate weapon. Barcelona and Madrid are in the situation that at the height of the Cold War we used to call MAD: Mutually Assured Destruction. It's the old story of the scorpion and the frog, again: one sting, and both would drown.

Madrid is playing hard-ball. In public at least the governing Popular Party of the uncharismatic Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, displays a stiff-necked Castilian contempt for Catalan hopes, insisting that Spain's regions are constitutionally forbidden from voting on independence. There has even been wild talk of sending in the army. This has united all the large parties in Catalonia (even the Catalan Socialist Party, which would campaign for a ""no"" to independence) behind an insistence on Catalonia's right at least to ask its people the question.

My own view is that if Madrid holds to its insistence that a referendum would be illegal, if Barcelona proceeds with plans for a referendum anyway, if Madrid rattles sabres before polling day with sufficient ferocity, and if the Spanish bond market doesn't react by visiting a plague on both their houses, then there's a good chance the separatists would lose. That may be the PP's brutal calculation. But the risks are immense; one gaffe during the run-up, one insult from the PP, could tip things the separatists' way; and even if the separatists lost, ""victory"" for Madrid would be bitter, wreaking enduring damage on the brotherhood of the peoples of Spain.

There is a way to avoid this cruel gamble. Two men have it in their power, if they can each take the pain of a partial climbdown, to end the impasse. One is Artur Mas, the President of Catalonia's government and a political moderate. The other is Rajoy, also from the moderate part of his party. He has undertaken to thwart a referendum, should concede one and should undertake to respect its conclusions.

Mr Mas, who has (only latterly) pushed for full independence, should concede a three-choice referendum. Voters would order by preference (1) status quo; (2) greater autonomy; or (3) full independence. If none received an absolute majority, second preferences would be counted.

Option 2 would probably win at the first count. If it did not, it would certainly win at the second. Catalonia could then proceed in an orderly way towards the nationhood it craves and deserves, but within the Spain so dear to the hearts of millions of Spaniards. Mr Mas, however, would have to endure Catalan obloquy not so much for offering devo-max as for trusting Madrid to deliver it. For Mr Rajoy the obloquy would be for conceding anything at all to Catalonia.

Enduring obloquy, however, is a burden of statesmanship. And here in Spain, statesmanship is in awfully short supply.",0,1365363462,null,0,false,0,c9adtr8,t3_1bv2k5,t1_c9adtr8,t3_1bv2k5,null,1431640956,12,false,Barcelona,t5_2qosg,12

Peut être avec plus d'options ou d'électifs? ie un cursus de base ""nivellé par le bas"" comme ce qu'on fait maintenant, mais avec la possibilité de prendre à côté du grec, du latin, du CAV, etc, des électifs de sciences, de lettres (une double spé quoi).

* Suppression des inefficacités économiques faciles à supprimer : on rachète toutes les licences de taxis et on libéralise tout ça par exemple.

* Faire du vrai service public ou ne pas en faire. On ne massacre pas l'hopital au profit des cliniques. Si la ferroviaire doit être ouvert à la concurrence, la SNCF n'a pas à assumer les lignes déficitaires si en plus elle doit avoir des tarifs concurentiels... Soit monopole, soit vraie concurrence.

* Simplification administrative (c'est prévu il me semble) : trop de paperasse en France.

* Forte baisse du périmètre de l'Etat au profit du reste de la société civilie et du domaine public : plus de pouvoir au régions, aux établissements publics (les ARS par exemple), ax associations ...

* Règles de déontologie plus claires sur le pantouflage. Un industriel qui se lance en politique ou un politique qui redevient avocat, ok. Un homme politique qui fait des allers-retours avec le privé en consulting, pas super.

* Proportionnelle à circonscription unique pour les législatives et inversion du calendrier législatives/présidentielles, transfert de l'IGF et autres corps d'inspections au Parlement (c'est son boulot de contrôler l'action du gouvernement) [ça n'aide pas l'économie en soi mais ça aide à produire des normes qui aideront l'économie]

* Donner du fric aux pauvres à court terme, parce qu'ils ont une propension marginale à consommer plus forte [ils épargnent pas/peu].

* pour le niveau international, plus précisement l'UE, arrêter de mettre la charrue avant les boeufs, ou plutôt de mettre les institutions avant la réalité. D'abord on fait converger les conditions macroéconomiques des pays pour que la zone euro soit une zone monétaire optimale et après on crée l'euro, pas l'inverse. Bon, un peu trd pour l'euro (avec les résulats qu'on connaît), mais on peut le faire pour l'Europe de la Défense, la politique étrangère, l'enseignement supérieur...

* Pas plus de deux mandats consécutifs qu'ils soient locaux, nationaux ou européens, inélégibilité à vie pour certaines condamnations, procédures d'enquête approfondies lors de la nomination des plus importants responsables de l'Etat, réforme des indemnités parlementaires pour baisser celles du députés mais compenser par une augmentation de celles servant à payer son équipe [dépenses bien sûr rendues publiques], mandat unique [mais réforme teritoriale et administrative pour le permettre: mon maire est maire, président de la communauté de commune et président de tout plein de syndicats locaux pour l'eau, l'agriculture, le ceci, le cela :c'est normal. Si mandat unique, il faut que toutes ces fonctions puissent être exercées par une seule personne par exemple].

* Référendum d'initiative populaire à la Suisse

* Référendum obligtoire sur un certain nombre de lois à la Suisse

* Retour de la responsabilité politique (là aussi c'est plus culturel que via les normes) : que l'AN utilise correctement la censure [qui devrait être une censure constructive btw], que les ministres démissionnent lorsque les circonstances l'imposent, que le Président démissionne en cas d'échec à une dissolution ou à un référendum (à la De Gaulle).

* Vaste effort de formation professionnelle (technique), notamment pour les chômeurs.

* Trouver de l'argent pour financer tout ce que j'ai dit (c'est pas trop possible je pense pour certaines mesures)

* Simplification des impôts, on est taxés à des taux très hauts et via 3848345835138534 taxes différentes mais on a le droit à 534523523 niches et 325432 aides. Super lisible.

En l’occurrence, n'importe quel conseil en stratégie dans une entreprise vous dira que la première chose à étudier correspond aux atouts de l'entreprise, ou du pays dans le cas présent. Et là, il est clair que la France possède des atouts évidents sur lesquels on devrait s'appuyer beaucoup plus. 

- On ne le dira jamais assez: la France est une destination extraordinaire en matière de tourisme. Première décision du coup: faire comprendre aux français qu'il s'agit d'un secteur d'avenir et d'une importance cruciale pour l'avenir du pays. Cela découle en une série de décisions potentielles : la création de zones destinées au tourisme par exemple comme le centre de Paris, l'amélioration de l'accueil des étrangers, le renforcement des capacités d'accueil touristiques, etc... On parle d'un changement de mentalité et de la création d'emplois ne pouvant être délocalisés. Il faut pouvoir renforcer notre ""valeur ajoutée"" dans ce secteur en se différenciant de la concurrence.

- Deuxième point fort : la bouffe. Non, je ne déconne pas, la France est un pays hors du commun en matière de nourriture et les seuls pays en compétition sont probablement légèrement en retard (Japon et Italie). Il est critique de conserver une politique de qualité alimentaire et de ne pas la sacrifier sur l'autel de l'industrialisation. Il s'agit donc là de promouvoir un secteur local de qualité et de faire savoir au-delà de nos frontières.

- Troisième point : la population. On constate que la France a toujours un taux de natalité important et qu'il s'agit principalement d'une population d'origine variée. La question est : comment en faire une force ? Sur l'origine ""ethnique"" je pense que l'on peut en faire un atout. J'adore par exemple trainer dans le Chinatown parisien (Belleville et le XIIIème). Si on arrive à en faire un atout en intégrant de nouvelles populations, pourquoi ne peut-on pas le faire avec l’immigration d'Afrique du nord ? Il s'agit d'une des cultures les plus riches qu'il ait existé et il est critique de pouvoir l'intégrer d'une manière positive pour la majorité des français. Un exemple : les mairies devraient pouvoir organiser des fêtes ouvertes à tous comme l'Aid El Fitr et devrait pouvoir réunir toutes les communautés (croyantes ou pas).

Par contre, il faut reconnaitre les faiblesses françaises :

- les divisions politiques quasiment insolvables. Il y a peu, un sondage mettait en évidence le fait que les français se divisent en deux : ceux qui mettent l'ambition (personnelle ou collective) comme valeur fondamentale et ceux qui mettent la solidarité. Avec le clivage actuel gauche-droite, ces oppositions sont difficilement réconciliables. Quand un politique avec un brin de charisme sera capable de défendre le fait que les deux ne sont pas tout le temps opposables, ça changera.

- l'impossibilité d'affronter des changements douloureux. Autant le dire, à chaque fois qu'un gouvernement a tenté de faire une réforme qui demandait un peu plus d'efforts aux Français, ils se sont retrouvés face à une levée de boucliers. Curieusement, il est plus facile à la gauche de faire des mesures de droite qu'à la droite d'appliquer son programme. Un exemple con de mesure impossible à faire passer : modifier le fonctionnement des taxis. Vous allez tomber sur de tels lobbys que vous ne pouvez rien faire.

Pour finir, on le dit depuis très longtemps mais visiblement aucun gouvernement ne veut vraiment s'y attaquer : il faut décentraliser, et vite. Paris et sa banlieue sont devenus invivables en raison des transports et du coup de la vie. Je sais que pour beaucoup de parisiens, la vie en province est ""has-been"" mais ce n'est pas entièrement vrai. Un exemple de mesure : demander aux entreprises chez qui l'état possède une participation de déménager leur siège en province. Imaginez le siège de la SNCF à Clermont-Ferrand par exemple, ça serait pas plus logique qu'à Paris ?

Je pense qu'il y a plein de choses qu'on peut faire, mais ce n'est pas en se concentrant juste sur ""faire payer les riches"" comme le pense la gauche qu'on va y arriver.",0,1365368164,null,0,false,0,c9afdjq,t3_1bv4vi,t1_c9afdjq,t3_1bv4vi,null,1431640225,20,false,france,t5_2qhjz,20

Ganz einfach, weil 10 sehr schlecht teilbar ist. Nur durch 2 und 5 (und 1 und 10). Zwölf ist schon besser. Teilbar durch 1,2,3,4,6 (und zwölf). Vielleicht ist zwölf auch am besten. Aber als alter Computer-Fuzzi gefällt mir einfach die 16 wegen der zwei hoch vier, wobei vier das doppelte der zwei ist. Irgendwie alles doppelt. 

Deshalb eignet sich übrigens auch das Dezimalsystem für einige Dinge total schlecht. Zum Beispiel viertel vor. Was ist viertel vor? 2,5? Dann bitte eher drei. Vielleicht wäre das Duodezimalsystem für Menschen tatsächlich besser als das Hexadezimalsystem. Menschen halbieren, dritteln und vierteln halt gerne. 16 kann man schlecht dritteln. Und ja, es wird irgendwann unübersichtlich mit den Zeichen. Wobei wir ja 26 (plus ß im Deutschen) Buchstaben haben. Und die können wir auch alle schnell erkennen.

&gt; Ist eh klar, dass Dezimalstandards gut sind, weil wir dieses System benutzen, aber genau deswegen ist es ja eine gute Idee!

Same is true for Soviet Union: different jobs have different benefits, and you can pick one you like. 

&gt; My ability to go on a vacation is not dependent on the benevolence of a bureaucrat, it is something I do how I please.

In Soviet Union you could get heavily subsidized vacation via union, but of course it's up to you to decide whether to choose it or something else.

&gt; Yep. And I can also afford a car, consumer goods, food, housing, and a bunch of other things that were rare or restricted in the USSR.

I'm glad you do, but can you say same about everyone living in your country? How much do you earn and what's the median salary?

In Soviet Union food was cheap and abundant. Many ordinary workers could afford cars and luxurious items... Not all, though.

&gt; What happened if a person refused to work his assigned job?

Well, you're free to choose your profession, but you need to choose one.

&gt; Would he be free to do something else, something not approved by the state? Or would he be sent to a labor camp or possibly shot?

If your choice is to be a dissident, yes. 

Please understand me correctly, I'm not a big fan of Soviet Union; and I won't be able to do what I do if Soviet Union had not collapsed (I'm a programmer working mostly for foreign clients).

Mehr echte Polizisten auf der Straße als Streifen und weniger Überwachungskameras sind wenn ich mich richtig erinnere immer schon Forderungen linker Parteien gewesen.

Lehrerausbildung und Lehrermangel und die katastrophale Finanzierung von Schulen sowie seltsame Lehrpläne sind dennoch politische Entscheidungen. Zudem hat die Union auch die Integrationspolitik verschlafen und das Problem der nicht integrierten türkischen Einwanderer mit verursacht. Als Arbeitskräfte waren die Leute ja gut genug, um den Rest hat sich niemand gekümmert. 

&gt; Und natürlich sollte Deutschland möglichst viele Armutsflüchtlinge aus Osteuropa aufnehmen - die werden ja eh nicht in unseren gutbürgerlichen Stadtvierteln untergebracht, also merken wir es nicht, wenn es mit Intergration dann doch nicht so klappt.

Nunja die Situation der Asylbewerber im Deutschland ist so grottenschlecht, dass selbst die UN sich darüber beschwert.

Either the state pays their debts and sells them at their real value or it sells them for their real value, anyway, it's irrelevant, between selling one (for example) for 50€ and having to pay its debt of 60€ or selling it for -10€, it's the same.

Nevertheless, the least the state is involved and the less it has to spend from the taxpayers money, the better. The money we might eventually get from selling those and the taxes we'll get afterwards from them are just the cherries on top of the cake.

&gt; The normal, standardized American accent is eminently understandable and well enunciated.

Do you speak more than one language? I just assume you're American because you get so defensive but it's obvious that you wouldn't have problems with American dialects. 

It's a fact that most American accents are rhotic. Standard High German is not which is why most Germans sound like idiots if they try to fake an American accent because it just doesn't sound right (that has NOTHING to do with American English. It's the inability to pronounce a rhotic R of most Germans).

Apart from that, there's also the lazy vowel thing. Vowels in German are mostly pronounced the same way. If you pronounce the vowels in the correct German way in the order A-E-I-O-U, your mouth goes from wide open to almost closed. And every word that is not a loan word is pronounced that way.

Now, try to pronounce a word with a lot of vowels (fortunately, opportunity, ability and so on) the way you'd pronounce it in a normal sentences. You should notice that the vowels are not as distinct as they are in German. Also, any kind of rhotic R in such words is basically covering the other letters because it's so unusual for German.

So those are two things that don't exist in German. How am I supposed to understand that as well as a dialect that has none or only 1 of those things? 

My mother's English is pretty bad. If she hears somebody from the UK on the TV, she can understand most of it (it's too fast some times). If it's an American, she describes it as mumbling.

Ad oggi (non ho un dato reale al momento, parlo per quello che vedo ogni giorno, se vi interessa faccio qualche ricerca) l'85% di tutto ciò è inagibile, una ""zona rossa"" **MILITARIZZATA** (sì, abbiamo dei militari che presidiano la nostra città, non so a voi ma a me è sempre sembrato scandaloso) nella quale la ricostruzione non è mai partita e i puntellamenti sono ormai inutili, perchè in quattro anni non è mai stata fatta manutenzione. Centinaia di milioni di euro sono stati sprecati per realizzare le case antisismiche a prezzi esorbitanti, e che dopo 3 anni e mezzo hanno già bisogno di essere ristrutturate (chiaramente il comune non ha i mezzi per farlo). La struttura commissariale, ora fortunatamente dismessa, ha ulteriormente complicato la gestione dei fondi rimasti, che vengono palleggiati tra governo, regione e comune. Il centro ad oggi è una città fantasma, di giorno ci sono gli operai che lavorano nei pochissimi cantieri aperti, alla sera si popola di ragazzi nei bar e pub aperti, uniche attività che sembrano non subire la crisi (noi Aquilani beviamo *abbastanza*, per usare un eufemismo :) ).

true,Haaveilla,Zespagne,Espagne,"Je suis d'accord avec toi sur l'ensemble des points, et surtout sur le premier. Travaillant dans l'industrie du tourisme, je partage totalement ton point de vue. C'est un des rares secteurs de l'économie avec une balance commerciale positive (les étrangers dépensent plus en France que les Français ne dépensent à l'étranger), et pourtant on pourrait faire tellement mieux, malheureusement le secteur manque de reconnaissance.  
Comment expliquer que la France, premier pays en terme de visiteurs au monde (même si le chiffre est un peu gonflé par les touristes qui traversent le pays pour aller des Pays-Bas à l'Espagne par exemple), ne soit que troisième en terme de dépense moyenne par touriste derrière les USA et l'Espagne ? Au journal de 20h on adore nous montrer les touristes chinois qui dépensent des fortunes dans des sacs Vuitton, mais le fait est que les touristes dépensent plus en Espagne.  
  
  
Le problème est qu'il est très difficile de faire quoi que ce soit au niveau du tourisme. J'en veux pour preuve la représentation de l'industrie au sein du gouvernement. Alors que l'on a un Ministre pour l'agriculture, le tourisme, secteur tout aussi (voir plus mais j'ai pas les chiffres sous la main) plus important économiquement, se tape un ministère de l'artisanat, le commerce ET, en dernier, le tourisme. Bon au moins c'est mieux que sous Sarkozy quand on avait un Secrétaire d'Etat chargé du Commerce, de l'Artisanat, des Petites et Moyennes Entreprises, du Tourisme, des Services, des Professions libérales et de la Consommation, ouf, tout ça !  
  
  
A tout ça vous ajoutez le fait qu'une région dispose de son Comité Régional du Tourisme qui décide de plein de choses, que les départements de la région ont chacun leur Comité Départemental du Tourisme qui décident de trucs dans leur coin, les offices du tourisme, les associations de communes, vous imaginez la cacophonie.

Government intervention in the economy is in my opinion necessary; if capitalism is not regulated it tends to derive into social darwinism. The optimal level of regulation in order to both achieve a functional society and minimize the gap between classes is, of course, subjective.

&gt; We are where we are because of the mess our governments have done, and now that we're trying to reform things

I think most people in ""austerity countries"" feel that those reforms are using them as a sacrifice to optimize the profit for other groups (who on some cases played a big part on the downfall of their economies).

&gt; Yeah, fuck the rich! How dare them be rich?

Nobody is criticizing the rich for being rich, they are criticizing the governments for legislating to suit their interests in detriment of the rest of the society. Even if we avoid the false generalization that all the rich were responsible for the crisis, the fact is that: they were the ones getting the most profit out of the good times (money generates money), and when the crisis came, the vast majority of the weight of the austerity seemed to be applied on the middle and lower classes, and on the common social net which those are the most reliant on. That's what people are angry about.

- Bruno Mégret a été exclu du FN en 1998
- Claude Jaffrès ne fait plus partie du FN depuis au moins 10 ans.

true,zakk,veneto,,"Non ho tempo di vedermi 10 minuti di video, mi dispiace. Lo ho visto a spezzoni, rispondo alla domanda: ""perché dovremmo rimanere nell'Euro?"".
Risposta: perché i debiti che abbiamo contratto con altri stati attraverso l'emissione di obbligazioni sono in Euro (BOT, BTP, CCT, CTZ, ecc...). Cambiando moneta (che ne so, ritorniamo alla lira) le possibilità sono due:

1) O alla data del cambio di moneta tutti i nostri debiti futuri vengono convertiti all'istante da euro in lire.

2) Oppure si decide di mantenere l'impegno preso e pagare le obbligazioni già emesse ma che scadranno in futuro in euro.

Nel caso si segua l'ipotesi 1, la Germania non vorrà le nostre lire, noi le avevamo promesso euro... Non stiamo onorando un debito, si deve dichiarare il default.

Nel caso si segua l'ipotesi 2, uno stato con i nostri attuali parametri economici è destinato a vedere la propria moneta svalutarsi. Sarebbe la stessa Banca Centrale italiana a voler svalutare la moneta, attuando una politica monetaria che ci permetta di massimizzare i benefici dell'uscita dall'Euro (per intenderci se il cambio resta 1:1 è come non esserne usciti, in ogni caso anche nel video che linki accettano il fatto che la lira sarà svalutata.). A questo punto mentre la lira si svalutano i debiti da pagare lievitano, perché sono in Euro. Default.
Questo credo sia il motivo principale per rimanere dell'Euro.

Due conti per essere quantitativo (fatti molto a spanne):

debito pubblico = 120% del PIL = 2000 miliardi

percentuale di debito pubblico allocata all'estero = 45% = 55% del PIL = 900 miliardi

Supponendo una svalutazione molto leggera per la situazione, diciamo un 20%, si avrebbe che lo Stato italiano dovrebbe pagare in più circa l'11% di interessi sul debito (come se lo spread si alzasse di 1100 punti), cioè 176 miliardi, circa 8 IMU. La durata media del debito pubblico è di circa 7 anni, quindi più di un'IMU in più all'anno. Senza contare che molto probabilmente l'emissione di debito in lire dovrebbe essere garantita da interessi simili. Senza contare che molto probabilmente la svalutazione sarebbe molto più alta. Senza contare i debiti che i privati hanno verso l'estero.",0,1365378614,null,0,1365378821,0,c9aixa0,t3_1buvac,t1_c9aixa0,t3_1buvac,null,1431638482,6,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,6

&gt;I think most people in ""austerity countries"" feel that those reforms are using them as a sacrifice to optimize the profit for other groups (who on some cases played a big part on the downfall of their economies).

Some of that might be true but some other times it's just used as a rally cry, it's always easier to scapegoat some foreign or small group for all of society's evils. Back in the day it was the Spaniards and the Jews, nowadays it's the Germans and the wealthy.

Don't worry though, special interest groups are also being quite affected from austerity.

&gt;they are criticizing the governments for legislating to suit their interests in detriment of the rest of the society.

Yeah, I also do that, that's why I'm opposed to more government intervention in the economy, it prevents them from mismanaging the money and it prevents people from trying to lobby the government so hard to get what they want at the expense of the public at large.

&gt;Maybe not, but many people inside Portugal probably feel that the EU is currently pushing measures on them which are against their interests.

Not really, people here are pissed of at how things got to be, not at the EU.

Heck, the three parties that scored the best in the last elections are all pro-EU and had all agreed and signed the Troika agreement which is now being implemented. If more than 75% of the electorate voted for parties which agree and support the austerity policies which we're now pursuing, then that's a clear sign we are committed in dealing with our issues.",0,1365379163,null,0,false,0,c9aj4as,t3_1bukqt,t1_c9aj4as,t1_c9aihjf,null,1431638390,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Ending public broadcasting entirely is abandoning cultural service and promotion of the language abroad, among others. In Europe public TV service is actually something well-defined and not strictly ""non commercial"". 

All of this policies are more aligned with ideology than anything else, they apply equally well to any country.

""Hello and welcome! I will show you today one of my Hohner professional guitars, a TE Custom. This TE Custom is a copy of a Fender Telecaster, with one or two specials that I am going to show you. Let's start with the body. The body consists of californian maple and is painted in a quite nice color. I would call it 'red burst'. It looks really good also due of the creme colored bindings and this one layer nacre artwork (He means the pick guard). It looks really really nice and I hope that the cam is able to catch this for you. Furthermore, the bridge is one where you are able to adjust every string on its own unlike a classic telecaster where you have to adjust alway two strings in compound. The strings go through the body, this is done to gain a little more sustain.""

It has an indian rosewood fingerboard.

Pickup (1:38 -- 1:57)

""The guitar is equipped with AWG vintage-pickups which in my opinion have an excellent sound. I removed the original Hohner pickups. The originals also have a really fantastic sound, but they are not quite as strong as the AWG ones as far as tech (?) is concerned.""

2.) Conclusion (5:17 -- 5:30)

""I hope you can hear that one can at least say it's a classic Telecaster sound with according variations. I think the guitar is really nice [alt.: they did a really good job], the entire setup is great.""

If anyone else could chime in I would appreciate the help.

It's definitely a walking city so you can see a lot of cool stuff just by wandering around on your way to and from class, and of course on weekends too. Make sure to see the medieval parts of the city because they're insanely beautiful (and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so kind of a big deal). The Puente Romano was built in like, the first century, so it's cool to walk across it just to know you've been on something that old. The cathedrals are worth seeing even if you're not religious, just be aware that many people there will be so try to stay quiet and not be too scantily clad if you can help it (though it can get crazy hot there in the Summer, so they'll probably forgive you). 

Nightlife is great if you're into that. If you want to meet locals (which you should), go out later than the American kids and other tourists. Locals sometimes don't really get started until 3am. Also, there are plenty of places to get dirt cheap alcohol so don't waste money drinking at the fancy clubs -- get that done before you're there so you don't waste four Euro per drink when you can easily get eight (or sometimes ten or twelve) shots for that somewhere else. I never had much trouble with the guys being pushy, but know how to tell them in Spanish to back off because it may come in handy (""Déjame en paz"" is what I was told to say, but I never had to deal with that so I don't know how well it works, haha).

Hanging out in the Plaza Mayor is great for people watching and having tapas or ice cream. I'm sure your host family will provide you with ""authentic Spanish cuisine"" but going out and having menú del dia at a restaurant with friends can be a lot of fun too. Restaurants there also won't rush you at all, so if you feel like just chilling on the terraza for a few hours and slowly working your way through a few courses, it can be really relaxing and nice.

If there's anything I can stress, it would be to try to meet locals and work on your Spanish as much as you can. I met an amazing guy while I was there and we still talk, while most people in my program barely spoke a word of Spanish outside of class because they only hung out with each other. It will be a way better experience if you push your boundaries a little because you can really meet some awesome people and see some great things if you look for them.

Nice try misquoting me; I also said ""but not its followers"" which is the most important part of the sentence. Don't mix up religion and ideology. They are two similar but different things. Religion always has a theological and/or divine part to it while an ideology doesn't. You can't group religions into ideologies. Capitalism does not belong in the same category as Islam even if Islam has laws which regard economy.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"Statements such as ""There is a chance of running into X in Y"" are useless to tourists, as the probabilities therein are heavily dependent on the geography of Y.

Neo-Nazis in Germany are located primarily not in the urbanised centres of cities, but in the rural areas of East Germany. As such, unless a tourist wants to go to the backwaters of East Germany, chances are that tourist isn't gonna see much.

Similar arguments hold for Greece - yet here, Karimr was precisely worried because Golden Dawn might have a presence in Athens. If you go into the wrong quarters, that might be the German equivalent risking to of going to rural East Germany in towns where the major is a NPD guy.

So his question is better answered with telling him which areas are generally safe, and which are not.

Furthermore, as it is in this case, increases in one quantity does not make it equal to another. Golden Dawn is a ""new"" - or maybe not old - political movement, and is still fairly young and active, with all the problems that go with it. The Neo-Nazis in Germany might have had a surge, but it's more like they suddenly have more attention thrown towards them - there was no massive increase in public support by any means whatsoever and a swell in ranks is measured in the hundreds in a country of tens of millions. They were kept in check of some form or the other for the past 70 years. The latter makes civil society in some sense aware of the problem, and more prepared for it as the same society would be without.

So, yes, your post is bullshit.

China is now fully enmeshed in the world economy. It would be a disaster for them to be involved in a war for the sake of North Korea. Attacks by NK on South Korea or Japan represents an attack against a major trading partner of China. There are entire generations in China who know only double digit growth as a result of this kind of trade, and upsetting it suddenly could eventually lead to major civil unrest within China as the new middle classes find their world crumbling. 

The more free the trade then the more costly the war. The economic arguments speak for themselves, but it is our mutual interdependence that stops us from killing each other.

They also are able to take advantage of the tax free nature of PX/Commissary and APO privileges, all of which cost tax payers.  This isn't even mentioning the thousands of contractors that are working in Germany (maybe others) tax free while also using these same facilities.  

Also, the author of your article states, on page 1: 

*The final bill: ""The United States spends approximately $250 billion annually to maintain troops, equipment, fleets, and bases overseas.""*

Well I guess you proved that you at least ""don't always believe the shit you read online"", including the sources that you yourself site.  Sounds a little different than $99 billion you are citing.  If you want to factor out Iraq/Afghanistan, here is another quote, again from the article you cited: 

*""More than $100 billion could be saved immediately by ending the wars and occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan.""* 

So that still leaves $150 billion in overseas costs not related to the war effort.  

Now wait, you are citing the fact that we just gave the Iraqis $313 million worth of equipment (a depreciated value, I'm sure) as a reason to maintain bases overseas when you state that it was too expensive to move it Germany or Korea?  So if it's too expensive to move it back to Germany/Korea, where else should we build bases so that we can move this equipment to?  I thought you were saying that was the point of having these bases, because it was so expensive to move the equipment?  But even with bases in Korea and Germany, it's *still* too expensive to move it now?  If they had to move it back to the US, guess what?  We still would have left $313 million worth of equipment to the Iraqis and the cost would have been the same.  

If you can show me where the Germans are still paying us (yes, in 2013, not 1991) to defend them, please cite the source, because I can't find it.  Why do you think we are closing so many bases in Germany?    And I live in Germany and work for the DoD and the Germans do not need us to defend them.  So again, why are we closing bases in Germany?  Because they don't need us and it is too expensive.  I won't even get into the ""we should never have been in Afghanistan/Iraq"" debate with you.

Attenzione questo è fuorviante, e non è la regola. 
Il congiuntivo nelle proposizioni subordinate va usato quando la proposizione principale è retta da un verbo cosiddetto di dubbio o opinione: pensare, credere, ritenere, giudicare, ...
Il congiuntivo esprime la non certezza di quanto viene espresso nella proposizione.

Gli altri verbi reggono tranquillamente proposizioni oggettive o causali con l'indicativo, introdotte dal 'che'.

Esempio
""Ritengo che /u/salutame_a_soreta *abbia semplificato*  troppo la regola a causa dell'insufficiente quantità di sonno""

Partially by the employer, partially by the employee. Exception being short-hours job (&lt; 360 €), in that case only the employer pays.

The employer directly transfers the money to your insurance, I never see it. We have a bunch of different insurance as well, some for special jobs (like state officials have their own, farmers have their own etc) and 1 per country (every federal state has it's own insurance, but they all are virtually the same).

&gt; Does everyone get the same benefits or is it means tested?

More or less the same for everyone, except that some of the insurance add some luxury staff. But otherwise you need to sign a private insurance policy with some insurance, but that only adds stuff like 1 person hospital rooms or nicer food, nothing important.

Teeth stuff is included, but only non-cosmetic things, as soon as you need some fake teeth or similar things you have to pay, a lot. That's why many people do that kind of procedures in Hungary now, the insurance is accepted for the basic stuff and the add-on stuff is way cheaper.

http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/economic-historian-germany-was-biggest-debt-transgressor-of-20th-century-a-769703.html

&gt; SPIEGEL ONLINE: You're saying that Germany should back down?

&gt; Ritschl: In the 20th century, Germany started two world wars, the second of which was conducted as a war of annihilation and extermination, and subsequently its enemies waived its reparations payments completely or to a considerable extent. No one in Greece has forgotten that Germany owes its economic prosperity to the grace of other nations.

&gt; SPIEGEL ONLINE: What do you mean by that?

&gt; Ritschl: The Greeks are very well aware of the antagonistic articles in the German media. **If the mood in the country turns, old claims for reparations could be raised, from other European nations as well. And if Germany ever had to honor them, we would all be taken the cleaners. Compared with that, we can be grateful that Greece is being indulgently reorganized at our expense. If we follow public opinion here with its cheap propaganda and not wanting to pay, then eventually the old bills will be presented again.**

Sucks at football.

**Amsterdam:**

Pros: Tramways everywhere with huge windows, excellent for sightseeing, you feel like walking out on the street while riding it. 

It feels like a business city much more than Copenhagen. Copenhagen feels so ""progressive"" you wonder how people even make money, looks like everybody is is a social worker. Amsterdam feels like there is serious business being done, deals closed, money made. It's a place where if you work in business, you feel like in one of the business centers of the world, you are at a place that matters, like a smaller London.

If you are single, then this prostitutes in shop windows thing. It's like the maximal objectification of women, feels like a huge power trip when you are a single man, like shopping for objects in boutiques. (No longer single so this does not apply, and yes, I know what I wrote sounds horrible, but I just say bluntly, honestly what a million tourists a year don't say yet do. Dutch people generally appreciate blunt honesty so I guess they won't be upset.) BTW the average woman in the street is less hot than Danes, somehow bigger, not just fatter but also stronger, more muscular somehow, and has less focus on makeup and hairdo and suchlike. I think they are worse for flirting but make better wives, a strong woman who cares about the practical stuff not makeup makes and excellent wife and mother.

Can football if you aren't upset about the fact that the majority of the players does not actually look ethnic Dutch - some people have a problem with it and not only because of racism, but also because of recruiting ex-colonials in the national teams is an unfair advantage over nations who had less of a history of colonialism.

Cons: stoner tourists. The whole hotel reeking.  Dodgy looking people openly offering hard, illegal drugs around the Dam. Generally bland food, although I ate an  excellent apple pie/cake. Food is much like British food in its blandness. Sandwich lunches hardly sitting down etc.

Klar. Siehe u.a. Leipzig: http://www.taz.de/!95677/. Ich kenne das auch aus meiner Heimatstadt. Allerdings liegt die Entscheidungsgewalt darüber oft beim Kreistag bzw. der Stadt oder Landratsverwaltung. Dort sitzen dann die Leute die Heime mitten im Niemansland in einer alten SS-Kaserne wo die Runen notdürftig aus den Eichentüren rausgekratz wurden... Flüchtlinge unterbringen. Damals kam von CDU Landtagsabgeordneten nur Hohn und Spott gegenüber Leuten die sich für die die Flüchtlinge Stark gemacht und selbst die Flüchtlinge wurden verspottet. In dieser Bräsigkeit habe ich das nur von CDU Mitgliedern kennengelernt. Aber das mag regional unterschiedlich sein.

The problem is that they would hire extra people just like that to gain voters, and then those agencies with the 3-4 times the amount of people needed would diffuse work and responsibilties in a tangled mess with a few dozen extra layers of extra beaurocracy, so that they could charge you for bribes and make it harder for anyone to make sense of who was responsible for what.

Another option is to take the cercancias train to Either Atocha and then change trains to a train to sol, 

Or Take the Cercanias train and get off at Principe Pio, which is a large shopping center where you can get a meal and look at some shops. 

It all depends on available time and what you want to experience, Personaly i would go to tribunal, walk down funcareal to gran via, go down montera (the street with the McD in the corner) to sol, look around, go up precisados to callao, from callao take gran via again down to plaza de españa, check out the egyptian temple behind it, theres also a good Chinese place under plaza españa (parking entrance) but its usualy packed so dont bank on that place. 

From plaza españa you can retake the metro (line 10, dark blue) back to nuevos ministerios, you get on the pink line which takes you back to the airport.

~~Sure, if you're cynical you can call it a bit gimmicky.

The feeling that we're one big continent, full of people that are remarkably similar in many ways.~~

~~I also appreciate the fact that this project doesn't require a huge budget: Let's say 1 big-ass screen is installed in a central square in the capital of each EU member. Let's say that's between 500k and a million Euro per screen, times 27, so we're talking about a price range of 13 to 27 million Euro. Which is approximately what the EU spent on agricultural subsidies (CAP) in 2006 within **2 to 4 hours**.~~

~~The biggest problem I see? There are 27 member states. If the screens are to be linked pairwise (where the pair is switched every 30 minutes), there will always be one screen (and country) left over that is not linked to another one. I propose we permanently un-link Estonia. What has Estonia ever done for me, eh?~~

If this were to be considered a form of war damage, then in principle it would be subject to reparation — except that according to the 1990 treaty, Germany would not have to pay it. If the money were, however, to be considered a normal credit, then Greece would be entitled to get the money back.

Without interest, the amount in today’s money would amount to $14 billion. With interest at 3% over 66 years, that would come to at least $95 billion. The problem is this: even partial recognition of such a debt would create a precedent that could bring untold claims in its wake.

So her government raised the interest rates up a lot, which caused a bad recession (which they knew would happen) but did bring inflation down. Then the law was changed so that unions could only strike after a successful ballot of their members. Beforehand they could strike at a moment's notice, even if their membership didn't want to and 'solidarity' strikes were common (so unions in unrelated industries would go on strike in sympathy).

So they caused a recession and curbed union power. Then they started closing mines, privatising industries and reducing or removing government subsidies. This had very drastic effects in the communities built up around the effected industries, unemployment and poverty sky-rocketed and a lot of these areas still have not recovered decades later. This is why a large part of the population hates her.

Not everyone was a unionised worker at a nationalised industry though. A lot of people were pissed off that the country was being held hostage by them.

Thatcher was a prime minister who denounced Nelson Mandela as a terrorist, defended the Chilean fascist dictator Augusto Pinochet, ratcheted up the cold war, and unleashed militarised police on trade unionists and black communities alike. She was Britain's first woman prime minister, but her policies hit women hardest, like Cameron's today.

A common British establishment view – and the implicit position of The Iron Lady – is that while Thatcher took harsh measures and ""went too far"", it was necessary medicine to restore the sick economy of the 1970s to healthy growth.

It did nothing of the sort. Average growth in the Thatcherite 80s, at 2.4%, was exactly the same as in the sick 70s – and considerably lower than during the corporatist 60s. Her government's savage deflation destroyed a fifth of Britain's industrial base in two years, hollowed out manufacturing, and delivered a ""productivity miracle"" that never was, and we're living with the consequences today.!

Ich folge auf YT keinem wirklich bekannten deutschen User aber trotzdem klicke ich auf der YT Startseite ab und an auf die empfohlenenen und beliebtesten Videos um es dann wieder zu bereuen. 

Da gibt es zum einem Leute wie LeFloid oder irgend so ein Mädel aus Bayern (Name vergessen) die über aktuelle Sachen reden. Unabhängig davon das die intellektuell überhaupt nicht in der Lage sind etwas gescheites zu den Themen beizutragen (die wirklich alle Themengebiete abdecken) wird nach JEDEM gesprochenen Satz das Video geschnitten. Hallo ich bin XXXX. SCHNITT. Ich möchte heute über Thema XY reden. SCHNITT. Find ich gut. SCHNITT. Weil so und so. SCHNITT. Was meint ihr? Schreibt in die Comments, interresiert mich was ihr denkt (als ob), abonniert mich usw... SCHNITT Screen um zu älteren Videos zu kommen und Outtakes in der Ecke.

Ist denn da keiner mehr in der Lage 2 oder mehr Sätze hintereinander ohne Fehler zu sagen? Oder warum wird da so viel geschnitten? Dazu kommt das nachdem ein Satz gesagt wurde der manchmal 3-4 mal nochmal abgespielt wird. Wahlweise auch in Zeitlupe oder mit krassen Videoeffekten.

Dann diese ganzen Lets Plays: Gronkh, Sarazar, usw. Davon gibt es ja wirklich mehr als genug. Wenigstens 3/4 der YT Startseite ist jeden Tag mit Lets Plays gefüllt.

Vor 2 Wochen oder so kam ja das neue Tomb Raider raus. Mit den Vorgängern bin ich mehr oder weniger aufgewachsen also Sacht ich mir: schauste dir mal ein paar Videos an ob es was ein gutes Spiel ist. Muss auch gar nicht lange suchen, auf der YT Startseite ist Lets Play Folge 2345 l Tomb Raider von Sarazar verlinkt. *Klick*. Nach 2 Minuten dacht ich mir: Ist der irgendwie geistig gestört? Lara wird aufgespießt und stirbt. Kommentar: *Das tat weh. Beim nächsten mal muss ich besser aufpassen.*  Jahaaa, das seh ich selbst. Gleiche Stelle, knapp dem Tod entkommen. Kommentar: *Das war knapp. Jetzt rutsche ich weiter den Flusslauf entlang*. Ehrlich? Irgendwelche Kannibalen fressen dann einen Menschen und er schleicht mit Lara drum herum. Kommentar: *Was machen die denn da? Ewww, die essen ja Menschen. Ist ja echt widerlich. Ich muss irgendwie verdeckt bleiben.* Anschließend schießt er seinen letzten Pfeil den er hat auf die Kannibalen. Ich weiß ehrlich nicht was das für eine Form der Unterhaltung sein soll. So ein Mix aus Selbstgesprächen und einer Beschreibung was er gerade macht was ich allerdings auch gleichzeitig sehe. Hätte ich das vor 10 Jahren gemacht hätte man sich ernsthafte Sorgen um mich gemacht. Und dann gibt es noch offensichtlich gestellte/gesriptete Lets Plays (besonders beliebt bei Spielen wie Slender).

Nächstes: 16-29 jährige (meist Studenten oder sogar noch Schüler) die versuchen lustig zu sein. YTITTY z.B.. Unglaublich unlustig und vor allem vorhersehbare *Witze*. Am besten noch ein paar Meme in die Videos packen. Sowas sollte einen Echo bekommen? WTF?

Mein persönlicher Favorit ist aber Herr Tutorial. Ich weiß gar nicht wo ich anfangen soll, meistens sitze ich sprachlos davor. Tipps/Turorials die einfach nicht funktionieren weil Mythen (ist halt so wenn man sich alle Tipps ergoogelt). SaminatorArmy oder sowas. WTF? Total bescheurte Dialoge. ""Ich war heute einkaufen. War besonders aufregend weil ich das nicht für mich gekauft habe sondern für euch damit ich das testen kann."" Srsly?
Über Youtuber wie xkarenia, die auch Tipps geben, kann ich nicht urteilen weil die idR nur über Beauty Zeug reden.

Über die Kommentare unter all diesen Videos muss ich glaube ich nichts weiter sagen.

Um auf den Artikel zurückzukommen: Die Zielgruppe der meisten bekannten YouTuber sind Kinder und Jugendliche bis 16 Jahre. Die Netzgemeinde die über so Sachen wie Netzpolitik, Transprarenz, Überwachung, soziale Medien und was weiß ich redet ist mMn nicht jünger als 16 weil man sich vorher nicht wirklich dafür interessiert.

I have nothing but admiration for her. What she achieved was amazing. For somebody from her background (shopkeepers) to become leader of the party she did become leader of (which represents, and was always led by, old money) was an amazing feat in itself. That she did it as a woman is even more amazing. I remember as a kid asking my mum if it was possible for a man to be prime minister.

There is no doubt at all that Britain is permanently a different place to what it was, and it's entirely down to her. Good or bad (I leave that up to you), she was the catalyst of enormous change. The current leaders of her party will evoke her name for ever more, but none of them are of her background. They are people born rich. They are not people who made something of themselves like she did. 

And she was a chemical engineer who invented ice cream affordable for all.

However, it's going to take a few years more for that winding-down to be completed.

That corpse is not Margaret Thatcher anymore. It is no different to your dead body or my body. The only difference, is the cold hard scientific facts stating that she was indeed a woman; among other minor differences of biology.

Whatever she did during her time of living, good or bad, certainly can't be attributed to a dead body. That body didn't rule Britain as Primeminister, Margaret Thatcher did. It wasn't the body that passed laws and gave speeches, it was Margaret Thatcher. 

Why are we spending so much time, effort and money on something that doesn't benefit anyone? 

I laugh at this silly sense of ""decency"" when her body is given a 2 million pound state funeral, when this money could have better served her name as a donation to charity, education or scientific research.

The problem is the balance of payments in any currency zone is not ever going to be even. There will always be one nation who has too little demand or too little productivity that causes money to flow out of a nation. That is the real problem behind the Euro. Greece and others cannot pay their debt because of a balance of payment issue with the rest of Europe. They wouldn't have this problem outside the Euro.

In a neutralised economy the rich and poor parts of the union tend to change. However if you just let the problem run it will permanently create a gap. You'll never over power the entrenched position no matter how hard you work. That is why currency unions inevitably become transfer unions. The alternative is secession. Outside the Euro the balance of payments is trivially zero. All Drachma must come back to Greece. They are worthless anywhere else. This means at worse foreigners will own Greece but the standard of living will be stable for Greeks.

true,absurdoinfinito,null,null,"You will love it!! I studied for a semester at the University of Salamanca. Definitely make a day or even overnight trip to Avila. It is is a really pretty and easy train trip through some very nice countryside. Avila is amazing and though it is small has plenty to fill up a day. It is totally walkable like Salamanca and the walls and cathedral are spectacular. There are also a number of very old castles within day trip distance of Salamanca like Penafiel in Valladolid or Cuellar or the Alcazar of Segovia. The Alcazar of Segovia is really fun because it is one of the inspirations for the classic Disney castles and as you walk up to it you feel like you are going to Cinderella's Castle. You should also go to Sevilla, it is a really vibrant, very Andualucian town and the Roman aqueduct is awesome.
In Salamanca, as mentioned before, the cathedrals are a must as well as the old Roman Bridge. There is also an open air flea market that is a great place to get souvenirs and gifts. It might be a long walk depending on where you are staying but it's worth checking out. The university is breathtaking and it will probably be among the first places you are taken but trying to find the frog on the facade by the Luis de Leon statue is a Salamanca rite of passage. If you take a tour inside the old University they will show you really neat things like grafiti carved into benches by famous Spaniards that attended there. If you are at all interested in history it is really cool. I spent a lot of time in the Plaza Mayor, a lot of nights there will be adorable older Spanish couples dancing there, you will see buskers and gypsies and eat really good ice cream. The plaza will quickly become your usual jumping off point for days spent with friends. You will find yourself meeting ""debajo del reloj"" on a regular basis and you will not be the only one there waiting for their group to gather. North of Salamanca, near Madrid you will find Franco's tomb and the Valley of the Fallen. This is a really amazing, giant cross carved out of mountainside. It is a monument to the Spanish Civil War. You can turn it into a really fun day trip by checking out the San Lorenzo monastery and El Escorial. El Escorial is a beautiful pastoral village like looks like it just stepped out of medieval times and the monastery is a nice complement to it. If you want to take some longer, weekend trips check out Galicia and Pais Vasco. In Galicia you will feel like you are in a completely different place than Castilla y Leon or Adalucia, it suddenly become very green and wet. There is more of a celtic influence in Galicia as opposed the Moorish feel of the southern regions.

true,ras_jorge,null,null,"If you honestly believe ""the debt is Spain's,"" I don't know what to say. There is a huge amount of Spain's debt that was used to invest in Catalunya, as in other places. This is why the trains, roads and airports in the whole country are top notch. It's very hard to pin down the exact numbers because it is convenient for both pro- and anti-independence parties to keep them obfuscated and the budgets are a disaster of bureaucratic layering (again, on purpose). But please don't fool yourself or other people into thinking that Spain borrowed tons of money to fund projects everywhere but in Catalunya. This is ridiculous. The debt can be chalked up to the various regions in various proportions, but not a single region is responsible for 0% of the total national debt. 

Imagine the break between Slovakia and the Czech Republic. What would have happened if each side had said, at the negotiating table, ""This is not my debt; it's your debt."" Suddenly two new countries are debt-free by virtue of having ditched the previous federal system? Absurd, and the entire international community would have refused to recognize either state until they figured out how to split up the obligations they had incurred when they were one state. In diplomacy, the procedures for negotiating independence are well developed and include ways of determining what each successor state's responsibilities are vis-a-vis each other and third parties to whom the predecessor state owed said obligations.

The separatist movement contends that Madrid takes money from Catalunya and spends it ALL elsewhere. This is not true. Do Catalan euros end up spent in Galicia? Of course they do. This is federalism. Do ALL Catalan euros end up spent everywhere BUT Catalunya? Hardly. Catalunya is the most indebted region in the country, which would be OK if we were also fine on the revenue side. But guess what? We aren't. Being the richest region among a ton of impoverished ones isn't great news. We can't pay our own bills - have you had a look at the regional debt of Catalunya? Below investment grade. Junk bonds. And to top it off, we needed a bailout last year from the central government - bailout money which was borrowed by the central government and transferred to us - in order to stay solvent.

On independence day, the country would be born laden with debt because no matter what, it would have to accept some share of the national debt, in addition to its own regional debt, which is expensive to finance and would be even more so given the eventual Spanish embargo of Catalan products. The rest of Spain is Catalunya's largest market for goods and services. Does this sound like a formula for success?

It's ironic that one of the worst side-effects of gaining greater autonomy has been the use of regional education bodies to effectively brainwash the people of my generation. They see none of the downsides or very real difficulties of negotiating secession; indeed, few even realize there is a negotiation to be had, as though you can just unilaterally declare yourself independent and walk away scot-free (this isn't how it works - just ask the Belgians).",0,1365436779,null,0,false,0,c9axhut,t3_1bv2k5,t1_c9axhut,t1_c9af8wg,null,1431631475,1,false,Barcelona,t5_2qosg,1

It is odd, we hardly have (in comparison to the US) have right wing hysterics in Sweden to that extent. So, can I assume that you agree with Chomsky in everything then? 

Also, I think it is so funny that you claim that a linguist is the best person to analyse economics and politics. I guess you  want economists to analyse the language of the 17th century perhaps? Honestly, why should we even have academics at all?

It was the most surprising experience. People were incredibly friendly. Even though we did not speak a word of italian, and most of the folk we met didn't speak a word of english (or german for that matter), literally no one dismissed us, on the contrary, everybody tried really really hard to figure out what we needed - and did so with a big smile and a lot of enthusiasm.

Also, the streets where bustling with people going somewhere, doing stuff, talking to each other over the balconies in the narrow streets. I loved every minute of it.

Every now and then someone told us how not to behave in terms of crime. We had not one incident where we felt threatened or anyone tried to remove something from our persons, but several incidents where people made us aware of pickpockets, not letting our mobiles lie around on the table etc. Awesome. Of course, we had the usual street vendors trying to unload an iphone or a gram of weed, but that just added to the fun :)

When we asked some people unloading melons from a van where we could eat typical napolean food (I think I used the words ""mangare"" ""tipico"" and ""napule"" with a lot of gestures), one of the guys dropped everything he was doing, and led us five minutes through small alleyways to a small restaurant where a cranky old lady served us spaghetti alle vongole - which were insanely good.

Then we were sitting outside of a small cafe at an intersection, sipping espressi and watching the INSANE napolean traffic (do they have *any rules whatsoever*? Even the traffic lights seem to have more the character of a suggestion than anything else), a scruffy guy came by, and I remembered that we needed something to smoke for the evening. So I stopped him and made the international sign for joint smoking with my fingers, and the international sign for ""where"" with my hands, and he answered with the international sign for ""give me some money and we'll see"". So I gave him 15 or 20 EUR, and he gave us the international sign for ""stay here"". And around the corner he went.

I was grinning with glee that I just found a hook up. After five minutes we began joking that I just handed 20 EUR to a stranger on the street in Napoli. After 10 minutes, we began joking that he probably won't be coming back. After 20 minutes, we felt like idiots. At the 25 minute mark, we paid our bill and stood up to leave, when the guy came back, waved at me to come with him, and in a back alley, he showed me the brick of hashish he got for me (I think they call it chocolate down there) and the rolling papers, then he showed me breaking off a small piece for him, took two papers, and gave me the rest.

Awesome. I love this city.

And yes, I know there's a lot of unemployment, organized crime, poverty, what have you. But I almost exclusively met stand-up people, and not just the ones that have their shit together, but even the scruffy guy with missing teeth on the street.

I sometimes can see that trains with a very short transfer time have been cleverly arranged, like the train I'd take to go Amsterdam arrives in Düsseldorf just five minutes before the next one leaves, but they've set it up so I would just need to run across the platform (like from Gleis 8 to 9) instead of going up and down stairs -- so five minutes would be plenty of time if nothing was delayed.

This disconnect is actively encouraged by politicians.

Even the pro-EU parties. People literally don't know who they are voting for.

&gt;

    Margaret Thatcher did great hurt to the Irish and British people during her time as British Prime Minister.

    Working class communities were devastated in Britain because of her policies.

    Her role in international affairs was equally belligerent whether in support of the Chilean dictator Pinochet, her opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa; and her support for the Khmer Rouge.

    Here in Ireland her espousal of old draconian militaristic policies prolonged the war and caused great suffering. She embraced censorship, collusion and the killing of citizens by covert operations, including the targeting of solicitors like Pat Finucane, alongside more open military operations and refused to recognise the rights of citizens to vote for parties of their choice.

    Her failed efforts to criminalise the republican struggle and the political prisoners is part of her legacy.

    It should be noted that in complete contradiction of her public posturing, she authorised a back channel of communications with the Sinn Féin leadership but failed to act on the logic of this.

    Unfortunately she was faced with weak Irish governments who failed to oppose her securocrat agenda or to enlist international support in defence of citizens in the north.

    Margaret Thatcher will be especially remembered for her shameful role during the epic hunger strikes of 1980 and ’81.

    Her Irish policy failed miserably.

&gt;Aujourd'hui, une dévaluation servirait uniquement à justifier l'appauvrissement lié aux déficits publics.

Pourquoi ? Qui propose une dévaluation sans rien derrière ? Dans le cadre d'un assainissement des dépenses publiques c'est raisonnable de dévaluer, on est apparemment d'accord.

On a more serious note, i will tell you how we look on this whole Kosovo matter. Is it biased or is it real, you decide, i am just giving you a view of average Serbian:

1) Albanians did ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and declared independence.

2) We can't do shit about it because US is on their side (=EU too).

3) US is on their side because we have never been an ally of US, we always rejected their proposals (one of them from recent history: Americans requested that they build [base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Bondsteel) on Kosovo, while Kosovo was still ours, which we rejected).

Reparation payments were negotiated and ordered by the Allied council, not Germany itself - which makes sense, if you think about it.
Did Germany pay for the damage and cost in human life they so horribly forced on the Greek people? No, they (we, I am German) did never do that. We never even pushed to do that.
However, this whole investigation be the Greek goverment very conveniently leaves out an very important aspect: The Allied council was responsible for this with very VERY very little German influence, and they ruled against further payments for other nations than very few important ones.
Also, Italy was the invader and the occupier, with most damage in property and lives was inflicted by the battles between die occupation force and Greek nationalists, which they themselves started a civil war against their own people right after the end of the war.

Are wages high in Norway. Yes in absolute terms, the [average monthly salary](http://reddit.com) in Norway is 6429$ a month, compared to 4740$ in Germany and 3696$ in France. No in relative terms, as Norwey's [GDP per capita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_GDP_nominal_per_capita) is about 80% higher as well. In real terms both numbers are lower, but comparable. So, Norwegians produce more goods and services which allows them to earn higher wages, this sounds  normal to me.

Is Norway uncompetitive? I really have no idea as this term is rarely explained but I don't think so. Norway ranks 15th in the [Global Competitiveness Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Competitiveness_Index) so it seems ok.

Is Norway so uncompetitive that its products are unable to compete in international markets? No, it has positive net exports (and a current account surplus) for a long time, currently standing at [15% of GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_net_exports)

Is Norway so uncompetitive that they are only able to maintain current living standards due to capital inflows from other countries (think Greece). No, completely the opposite. They are saving a huge amount of the money they earn from exporting oil so they are able to maintain their high living standards even when oil runs out.

So Norway has wages in line with their economy, they are highly competitive in the world stage, manage to have a positive balance of trade, and are saving/investing their oil wealth so their living standards remain extremely high even after their oil runs out. But sorry, this is a huge problem and the only way to solve it is by cutting wages. ",0,1365451143,null,0,false,0,c9b2wq9,t3_1bwn2k,t1_c9b2wq9,t1_c9ax1u9,null,1431628923,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

You misunderstood. My analysis is, that people have the (probably accurate) impression that the situation in greece is endemic (corruption, too man public servants, too high a degree of entitlement programmes that can't be supported by the revenue etc) to a degree where only a collapse can provide for a reason to change.

I'm not saying that conclusion is the only one, but it seems to be the only one actually implementable without proactive support from the government and people in greece.

If the greek government and population were to come to their senses, they'd adjust their spending and lifestyle to what they can support. Then very likely no one would have the motivation to call for such harsh measures.

&gt;  There are always alternatives, particularly if Greece regains its sovereign currency.

That's a myth. Re-establishing a currency after a default means massive devaluation and would effectively cut off greece from any western world amenities. It would become a low wage industrial society, something like a second world within the EU. Everything of value produced in greece would be exported, and imported goods will become unaffordable to the middle class.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;First of all, Greece is a wealthy country. Not as wealthy as the North, but by all objective measures a modern industrialized economy. And yes, Greece is still actually wealthier than South Korea on a nominal gdp per capita basis. After 5 years of contracting. Of course, I'm not sure that will still the case after this current austerity madness.

Good - stop receive a single Euro then and start being net payer. As another European tax payer I am becoming bloody tired of paying. 

Second - prove that the structural funds money has been used well. 

&gt;You should be aware that the recent bailout monies have been to shore up European banks i.e. ensure they don't go under. This has been sold as a bailout to ""Greeks"" but if you look at where the money has been going, its simply to the banking elite.

So  - the Greeks can be free to reject them. However, they want to stay in the Euro. If they want to leave - fine. 

Why on earth should a rich country, who has mismanaged its finances receive debt cancellation, just because they have borrowed like there is no tomorrow? Are the Greeks more deserving than the Italians? Spanish? Portuguese? Finnish? Swedes? Why are they so special? 

Because - in debt cancellation someone *always* picks up the tab. You just do not want the Greeks to do it, you want *other European tax payers* to do it. 

How on earth can you ask an Estonian who are much poorer than the Greeks to pay them off. Out of the EU's all countries - why should Greeks be treated so special? Why should my money go to them? What have they done to deserve that? Frankly, I'd much rather my money goes to a country who doesn't behave like a child and borrow like a madman, the Baltic states for example (who are poorer than the Greeks btw) or Romania/Bulgaria.

I most certainly can understand debt cancellation for the thirld world countries, but according to yourself, Greece is a rich country. Why should rich countries get debt cancellation? Then it should go for all countries in the world - or what on earth makes the Greeks so bloody special? 

Second - why did they take all the loans? 

Third - you forget that the Greeks have a choice - they can choose to cancel their debt any day, just like Argentine. However, they have chosen not to.

His behavior disappointed me... you know, I didn't think anything but the worst about him based on his past, but last year he arrested all those people and I thought hmm maybe there's hope in him yet... and then he fucks it all up by yelling at a meeting with Catherine Ashton. Just how primitive can you be to yell at a meeting with the EU? You know, these people are all cultured people, listening to opera, driving electric cars and having gay parents. You can't treat them like this, you'll hurt their feelings! It's without doubt now that the EU joining date won't happen anymore under the current government, so I'm not sure what else can they do for the remaining 3 years. Better to just have elections now...

...and I'll say another, perhaps stupid thing. I think that, if Dacic wins the next elections and his party becomes the strongest, that Dacic will recognize Kosovo's independence and be done with this agony. Not because he has strong will or because he's some genius who know's what's best for Serbia. I think it's maybe because he's drunk all the time. I think that, had only Dacic went to the meeting last week, without Vucic, that he would've signed the agreement. Perhaps because Catherine Ashton would've supplied him with a never-ending stream of whiskey. He would've signed it and it would be in the long run good for Serbia. But then that asshole Vucic turned up and ruined anything. I would like Dacic to win the next elections so that he would be drunk 24/7 and just agree to everything the EU says, then perhaps this hellhole of a country can finally move in the right direction for the first time in 20 years.

Je ne mets pas toutes les dévaluations dans le même panier, je me demande juste pourquoi la France a toujours besoin de cette saignée chronique qu'est la dévaluation et qu'il faudrait peut-être réfléchir à comment guérir le malade. 

&gt;Pourquoi ? Qui propose une dévaluation sans rien derrière ? Dans le cadre d'un assainissement des dépenses publiques c'est raisonnable de dévaluer, on est apparemment d'accord. 

Bah, je ne sais pas. Qui propose une dévaluation avec assainissement des dépenses ?  

&gt;C'était une question. Au lieu d'y répondre, tu balances des mots sans expliquer ce que tu entends par compétitivité, qui est une notion très vague et teintée d'idéologie.

Non, c'était un procès d'intention, ok. Tu suis ta question d'une insinuation sur ce que la compétitivité signifierait pour moi. Or, si j'avais voulu parler spécifiquement de la compétitivité-coût, je l'aurais fait. Mais je ne pense pas qu'il s'agisse que de cela en France. Les entreprises françaises ont une aversion pour l'investissement et le système éducatif et de formation continue sont des bastions d'intérêts corporatistes.

&gt;Évidemment, c'est compliqué, et personne n'a parlé de solution miracle. Par contre, tu parles de ""jeux dangereux"", de ""dévaluations constantes"". Il y a de bonnes dévaluations, celle de Pinay en 1958 par exemple. Il me parait pertinent de faire une dévaluation aujourd'hui, accompagnée d'un plan de redressement et d'indépendance énergétique.

Au niveau de l'euro donc ? 

&gt;Meuh non, je dis juste que l'amélioration des compétitivité-coût et compétitivité-prix ne doit pas aboutir à un sacrifice des conditions de travail comme cela a été le cas en Allemagne. Après, je ne suis pas en faveur de cette sanctuarisation (très française) de la consommation au détriment du travail.

J'espère aussi qu'elle n'y aboutira pas. Mais il ne faut pas se faire d'illusion sur les mécanismes comme la dévaluation qui résulteraient en une perte évidente de salaire sans toutefois garantir que l'inflation fasse remonter ceux-ci.

Besides, in your Swedish example - who exactly have we asked to bail us out? Haven't we  we been net payer or receiver to the EU/IMF or any God damn institution you can think of. The fact is, what you do not seem to get is, that it is not of any other countries business if for example, another country (let us take Norway) have an expensive public sector *if they can afford it*. Same with borrowing, but added to that, I am sure you are aware of that the Greeks cheated and lied their way into the Euro. I'll happily provide links of course. So, Greece's borrowing is other countries concerns because they keep asking other countries tax payers to pay for them + they are not following the Maastrich treaty, which they have signed. So, yes, it is much more a concern than Sweden's household debt. 

Also - what sterotype? The stereotype that they have borrowed like there is no tomorrow? 

Their debt/GDP rate is 160 %- I rest my case.

The sterotype that they are, and have been the net recepients of money from the EU since they joined and failed to build up a competitive industry? Well, prove me wrong then. Please, when have they ever been net provider to the EU? What has happened with the EU money?

Our constitution reserves 10 seats in paliament for serbs, 4 Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians, 3 seats for the Bosniaks, Montenegrins, Croats, Hungarians, Toskan (I have no idea what Toskans are), 2 seats for the Turks, and 1 seat for the Gorans. The ""rest"" of 100 seats is allocated to everyone else. However, the 1.6 milion albanians (many if not most outside the country considering a population of 1.75 milion) who could vote must devide the 100 representatives amongst themselves + the minorities, meaning that the minorities get the 20 seats without the need to vote. **if** they vote, they need to get just a small town to vote in order to get double to tripple their reserved seats. it's insane.

The result is that the current government technically only has 32% of the vote (and that with a barely functioning coalition). The minorities are automatically part of the government, and always vote in line with the leading party.

The 18x number applies to the serbs because according to this census they get 10 reserved seats without voting at all, meaning 4.4% of the population get 8.3% of the vote with outomatic part in the government **without having to fucking vote**. If they vote they can get to 10% or even more with 18x less votes than Albanians do.

The Goranis are a mathematical joke, 1 Gorani has the voting power of somwhere around 800 Albanians.

And the biggest joke? Nowhere in the constitution nor in any law does it specify how a party can be ethnically defined, meaning, how could you possible define your ethnicity? As a result there are some younger people who want to do a practical joke and run the Kosovo pirate party as a serbian party, but with a neutral composition. As a result with 2000 hipster votes from the capitol Prishtina they could get 5-8% of the parliament...

Oh, and the only way the constitution defines ethnicity? Via the [Ahtisari Plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahtisaari_Plan) (which is above the fucking constitution). That plan defines anything christian orthodox as serbian, and every serb needs to be christian orthodox to be a serb by law. How fucked up is that? It doesn't even account for the albanian orthodox history and monuments, completly rewriting history.

I could go on and on, but to put it blunt. If there ever was an indicator that state building missions by foreign missions don't work, it is Kosovo.

true,bigMacGyuver,null,null,"Hello and Welcome!

Today I wanna show you one of my Hohner Professional guitars, it's a TE Custom. 
This TE Custom is, as you may easily recognise a copy of the Fender Telecaster with - lets say - one or two little specials which we are soon gonna talk about. 

Let's start with the body: The body consists of California Maple and is coated in a very pretty colour, I'd say it's some kind of ragburst. It becomes impressive, also with the cream-coloured bindings and the one-layer permute pick guard.
It's looking pretty awesome in this combination and I really hope the video camera will be able to get this across. 
Furthermore it has a bridge with six single saddles not as the classic Telecaster where you get one saddle per two strings and here you can really tune every single string on its own, which is for me actually an absolute must. 
It's all organised as a string-through system, as you can see here at the back, the strings are fed through the body. It's done to get a little bit more sustain.
Equipped is the guitar with AWG AINiCo5 Vintage-Pickups, which have - in my opinion - an excellent sound. I removed the original Hohner Pickups; the originals also have a phantastical sound, but they aren't as strong as the AWG's in the attack. The AWG's just do a better job here. 
Apart from that the electric build up as a normal Telecaster, nothing special. We got a volume controle, we got a tone controle and we got a three-way switch and well, that shouldn't surprise us. 

Getting down to the neck: The neck is made from Californian Rock Maple with Indian Rosewood fingerboard. As you can see: light in the back and dark from the front and the headstock - and thats the first small special with this guitar - is phantastically milled. You can at the end this double-stage cutout, that really pleases my eye. 

The second special of the TE Custom should be the indiviual adjustment of the neck, here at the neck plate we can see a small hole. Inside the hole is a small grub screw. This grub screw presses on small metal plate at the neck. Thereby you can adjust the neck in its total bent. Luthiers usually do that with some small inlay plates. It's not necessary here, you can adjust it with the grub screw. 
That's how you reach really individual lateral positions. The one adjust right now should be about, I guess, 2.5, 2.8 millimeters, I didn't measure that[, it's just Pi times thumb {which is a german way of saying circa}].
The guitar is despite its age of, I guess, twenty years in a flawless condition, you can see it. It should be really seldom that you would find a TE Custom in such an immaculate condition. 

About the sound, the video camera won't reflect the sound very good, I still wanna play you guys one little chunk in different pickup positions, so you might get an idea on how this guitar could sound, though you can't value it as an audio test. I'm playing over a Fender Hot Hot Deluxe and here comes a small piece played in the three positions: 
[starts to play]
I hope that you guys can at least say a classic Telecaster, a classic Telecaster sound with the appropriate variations. 
For myself I can tell that this whole setup is really succesful and I hope it showed you somehow how this guitar works and what you can do with it. 
Hope you liked it.

true,Altberg,null,null,"Your opinion as to whether Greece had any place in the cold war or not, is irrelevant, as British and regime forces opened fire to peaceful protesters in the December of 1944. The Allies took the initiative to get involved against partisan forces literally months after the end of the Axis Occupation. To criticise Greece because Truman, who had decided to get involved in the situation, chose to give relatively minor (in comparison to the German debt) military funding to Greece in order to ""fight communism"" is beyond ridiculous. The next elections weren't until 1946, from which the communists were of course banned. To regard the involvement in the Cold War as a ""choice"", rather than the Allies choosing the partisans as one of the enemy factions of their cold war, is wrong.

There is nothing to fix in my post-- certainly, no one gives much of a shit for anyone else's country but their own (as the German government very well continues to demonestrate) but the assertion by silverionmox that debt forgiveness for only **one** country that is in a financial crisis (which also committed numerous attrocities), but not for any other is incorrect. It's worse than a double standard-- the worst attrocity that all these other countries in crisis today seem to have committed was to have incompetent politicians.

Your assertion that military funding, a common practice during the cold war, is even remotely comparable to the massive debt forgiveness that followed WW2, and which denied much needed reparations to formerly occupied countries, is also wrong. The aid certainly wasn't sent to avoid post-war austerity or authoritarian regimes.

The fact remains; Debt-wise, it's very hard to find historical examples of  anybody who got treated more favourably than post-WW2 Germany.

I do think that this was indeed the case. Prop up the anti-communist forces to fight the KKE and prop up the economy (not just military funding) in order to avoid giving the people additional reasons to support the communists.
  

&gt; The fact remains; Debt-wise, it's very hard to find historical examples of anybody who got treated more favourably than post-WW2 Germany.  

I agree with your assertion. And why shouldn't they have been treated more favourably than others? Germany is a large-sized country in the middle of Europe right on the border to the Soviet sphere of influence. It possesses more economic and military potential and is in a more volatile state than most other countries at the end of WW2. Securing Germany for ""the West"" is of paramount importance.
  

&gt; Oh, and on the assertion that Greece had no place in Cold War or ""realpolitik"".  

I wrote moral sentiments, not Greece.
