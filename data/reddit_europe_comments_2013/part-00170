&gt; The difference under legalisation is that you'd take away all the monopoly and power from the drug cartels, and ultimately that's your goal, they're the ones who most fuel the violence.

The problem here would be caused by the EU's peculiar setting: drugs would be legal in Spain, so it'd be hard to prosecute smugglers (not impossible, but more difficult, and organized crime is good at this), so they'd have a safe haven, but they could still export in all of Europe, against the law, abusing the lack of borders control.

Here we're talking about Mexican Drug Cartels and their affiliated gangs, who are the scum of the Earth and could barely be considered human... Just do a wiki search for Los Zetas or La Linea.

This is made even worse by relatively high fluctuations -- most cities are too small (or not enough people get murdered, if you want to look at it this way) for the numbers to be stable. They vary a lot from year to year.  
For some, it's easy. Take Berlin, that's pretty well defined at 3.52 million, which gives us a rate of 1.16 for 2010 or 1.8 over the past five years where data is available. With Paris, we can still make a pretty good guess that they mean the city proper, because otherwise we would arrive at unrealistically low figures (1.87 for 2010, 1.46 for five years). London (assuming proper, not urban or even metro area) had 1.59 in 2010, 1.78 for five)... hmm... this isn't too difficult, after all. 

In order of number of homicides in 2010:

(Don't quote me on this.)

Anyway, crime statistics are notoriously difficult to compare, so keep that in mind and don't draw any conclusions. In the table above, Paris has only 2.2 million, so it's really just the core, while other cities include a wider area. You'd think with homicides it's pretty clear cut, but the definitions could still vary by country. Presumably, those are *intentional* homicides, but do you could double homicides as one or two? How good are they at detecting homicides, that is, how many go unreported? If people go missing and are later declared dead, do you assume a homicide, and if so, do you count it for the year the person went missing or when the assumed victim has been declared dead?

true,8ofspades,GERM,Germany,"**European policy makers, central bankers and the region’s citizens surely felt relief on Wednesday when Eurostat, the eurozone’s statistics agency, revealed that the 17-country European Union had finally come out of its year-and-half-long recession.**


**There’s another group of people who should thrilled to see the eurozone economy finally growing again: retirement savers.**


Over the last two years European stock markets have lagged a number of other markets. Since May 2011, which was shortly before the recession and just prior European markets tanking, the US’s Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index is up 34%, while the Euro Stoxx 50, an index that tracks blue-chip eurozone companies, is down 5%.


Individual country performance has been mixed — but still below the S&amp;P — with Spain’s Ibex 35 falling about 14%, France’s CAC 40 up 8% and Germany’s DAX up 21%.


But as the eurozone begins to grow again, retirement accounts around the globe could get a big boost. Public companies, and their stocks, are likely to see some gains as the economy improves, investment professionals said.


Most diversified investment portfolios will have some exposure to Europe and because European stocks have been seen by some as cheap, it’s likely that exposure has increased since the eurozone recession began. That could be a boon for retirement savers who have added European stocks to their portfolios.


**Investors adding European stocks**


Two years ago Mouhammed Choukier, chief investment officer at London-based Kleinwort Benson, which manages US$7.4 billion, had no client money exposed to Europe. He began adding European stocks in the first quarter of 2012 and now his clients’ equity portfolios have about a 20% allocation to the region, excluding the United Kingdom.


Choukier is confident that his clients will see their savings tick higher the healthier Europe becomes.


“Without a doubt we think returns will increase,” he said. “We think that over the next couple of years European equities could push ahead and realize some value.”


Norman Raschkowan, vice-president of investments for Toronto’s Mackenzie Investments, has also increased his allocation to European stocks. The region now accounts for about 20% of the non-Canadian equity portion of his funds, up from less than 10% two years ago.


According to EPFR Global, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm that tracks global mutual fund inflows and outflows, over the last six weeks $7.1 billion has flowed into European funds. That’s the best six-week run the region has had since April 2008.


Investor confidence and an improving economy has a lot do with the change in fund flow direction, but if you have a diversified portfolio your allocation to Europe — both in personal portfolios and pension funds — has also been increasing because the region is cheap relative to other markets.


On a price-to-book basis, Europe is trading at a 25% discount to its long-term average, said Choukier. Spain is trading at a 45% discount, while Germany is trading at a 15% discount. On a 2014 price-to-earnings basis — a key valuation that shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company’s earnings — the Stoxx 50 is trading at 10 times earnings, while the Dow Jones Industrial average is trading at 11.7 times earnings.


Stephen Lingard, managing director of Franklin Templeton Multi-Asset Strategies, manages funds for Asian and European clients and he, too, has increased his allocation to Europe. He believes that as valuations climb closer to their historical norms — something he said should happen over the next 6-to-12 months — investors will get a good boost in returns.


But Lingard cautions investors not to get too carried away. Just because Europe has had a couple of quarters of growth doesn’t mean the region is problem free. Lingard is still concerned about high unemployment and worries that improving markets could cause policy makers to take their eye off many issues that are still pressing.


Still, Choukier believes that over the next seven years, Europe will give investors an annualized 8% total return per year, versus the 5% he projects for American markets.  


**Not too late**


For investors who have little or no exposure to the region, Choukier said it’s not too late to buy in. He recommends purchasing an exchange-traded fund that tracks the main European indexes.


Raschkowan said that certain sectors, such as auto parts or pharmaceuticals, offer opportunities, too.


If you want to own individual company stocks, Lingard said the best bet is to look for companies with a headquarters in Europe, but business and product sales around the world. These companies tend to be less susceptible to volatility because they operate in other jurisdictions.


“The best time to own risky assets, like Europe, is when a country is coming out of a recession,” said Lingard. Take the US, for instance. Since the recession ended in June 2009, the S&amp;P 500 is up 81%.

What happened was that the animate nouns split into two separate sub groups which became the masculine and feminine. The inanimate stayed the same and served as the later neuter in the new paradigm. The reason that the two noun classes were named after genders in Latin grammars was that the nouns that really did have a biological gender divided (basically) evenly among the two classes that came from PIE's animate class.

**Un Etranger en France, c'est un emigre, un Francais a l'etranger c'est un Expatrier.**

Peut-etre faut-il commencer par ca, ne pas se drapper d'une vertue ou d'un statue particulier, etre un immegre, c'est tout, surtout que pour etre Ex-Patrie (Hors de sa Patrie) c'est avant tout une souffrance chaque instant. Historiquement, l'expatriation est pour les exiles qui fuient leurs patrie d'origine car la vie y ai devenue instable pour eu: les nobles a la revolution. Les refugies syrien au Liban sont bien plus des expat que toi ou moi, qui sommes avant tout des immigrants.

Des lors, oui, il y a toujours des montees de nostalgie/melancolie, je me souviens de mes annees de colleges/lycees, des brouillard d'automne de la bourgogne, ou les vendanges... De la France je suis nostalgique de son rythme de vie que je connais et qui me rassure: des repas avec entree, plats, fromage &amp; dessert avec couteau &amp; fourchette, le savoir faire du boulanger, Les etales de marche... Je suis aussi nostalgique de tout cela de temps a autre. Et la ou je vis, je connais d'autre Francophone qui ont ces memes sensations. La difference avec un expatrie, c'est que je peux voyager jusqu'en France, pour retrouver toutes ces sensations.

Peut-etre faut-il faire la distinction entre ce qui est typiquement Alsacien qui te manque (l'agneaux de paques, la choucroute, la cathedrale de strasbourg par exemple), et ce qui est plus generalement issue de la France: la radio/tv francaise, le systeme educatif, le systeme de couverture sociale, la gastronomie, la litterature...

Avec le temps j'en suis venu a comprendre pourquoi je souffrais de ces souvenirs nostalgique: je garde encore apres 7ans en tete l'idee profonde qu'un jour ou l'autre je ferais le voyage inverse pour m'installer en France.

About Russians, well... it's certainly not that black and white. I can only talk about Estonia, but... if we look at statistics [52% of the people in Estonian prisons identified themselves as Russian, and 40% as Estonian,](http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/eesti/venelasi-vangis-eestlastest-tunduvalt-rohkem.d?id=18545338) while Russians make up about 24% of the population and Estonians 69%.

As to why there's more Russians in prisons, I can only vaguely guess it has something to do with:

* Estonians tend to get a higher pay for the same job than Russians (same source).
* Committing crimes for money doesn't seem as bad if 40% of Russians don't feel as part of the society (same source). 15% of Russians don't consider Estonia their homeland, however 20% are not sure and 65% *do* consider it their homeland. Also it's worth noting that only 3% of Russians wished to move to another country, 6% had considered it and the rest *did not* have a wish for emigrating, which is interesting. (Same source.)  
* In Estonia, there were 3.8% of Russians in 1934. By 1959 it was 20% and in 2011 24.8%. Almost all of them were people who the USSR transferred to Estonia as factory workers and their families, and nowadays also their descendants, born already in Estonia. Most of these were not people who relocated from their own free will.

Je suis né à Nancy, de mère française et de père autrichien, et mes parents ont tout de suite bougé. J'ai vécu dans plusieurs pays limitrophes de la France, pour revenir (en Île-de-France), puis repartir avant d'entamer des études en Belgique. J'ai été à l'école dans des écoles françaises, écoles européennes, etc. donc j'ai reçu une éducation *plus ou moins* à la française. Ce que je veux dire, c'est que j'ai lu Maupassant, Flaubert, etc. à l'école comme tout le monde et je pense avoir les mêmes références que tous : j'ai joué au 1000 Bornes, j'ai vu la Grande Vadrouille et les Bronzés, toussa. D'un autre côté, l'histoire de France, j'ai jamais bien vu. Ou retenu. Bref, j'ai eu une éducation ""à la française"", avec des touches des autres pays, dans lesquels nous vivions, et teintée de culture autrichienne.

J'y ai beaucoup réfléchi, à cette question, mais je ne me sens pas plus français que je me sens autrichien.

Je revenais chez ma grand-mère en Lorraine plusieurs fois pas an, et pour moi, la France est synonyme de vacances. J'allais (je vais toujours !) à l'école à l'étranger, quand je suis en France c'est qu'il y a pas cours. Ça marche pour l'Autriche aussi.

C'est vrai qu'il y a des trucs que je regrette. Le fromage avec une bonne bouteille de rouge, la bouffe, le déjeuner qui dure jusque 17h, la campagne, Fort Boyard... Ce sont surtout des trucs ""de vacances"", des trucs que j'associe avec ma famille, mon enfance. De nouveau, ça marche pour l'Autriche aussi. Pour la bouffe, parce que le pinard autrichien c'est dégueulasse :P

Je suis l'actualité française pour ne pas perdre le lien, et comme je vote ça me paraît important. C'est pas toujours simple, mais je m'y tiens au maximum. J'ai pas beaucoup de connaissances françaises (la plupart sont retournés en France), mon seul contact quotidien avec la France c'est sur /r/france et le soir à 20h.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"You probably haven't never been in DDR? My parents traveled via eastern block countries in the 70s and the last infrastructure work made there was build by certain A. Hitler and then nothing had been done. My parents were used to Finnish and Swedish standards of living and to them eastern Europe was dirt poor.

I myself visited west Germany first time around 1988, and god damn, it was much more richer, prosperous and developed than Finland. The first time I myself visited former DDR, from Rostock to Berlin in around 2001, they still hadn't caught west Germany of 1988, actually Rostock still had ruins and abandoned building from the second world.

Actually one example really testifies who horrendous and poor life in East Germany was...

&gt; Due to the strong German tradition of drinking coffee, coffee imports were one of the most important for consumers. A massive rise in coffee prices in 1976–77 led to a quadrupling of the annual costs of importing coffee compared to 1972–75. This caused severe financial problems for the GDR, which perennially lacked hard currency.

&gt; As a result, in the summer of 1977 the Politburo withdrew most cheaper brands of coffee from sale, limited use in restaurants, and effectively withdrew its provision in public offices and state enterprises. In addition, an infamous new type of coffee was introduced, Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), which was 51% coffee and 49% a range of fillers, including chicory, rye, and sugar beet.

That is low. While in East Germany you might have gotten an apartment and car, if you can call a Trabant a car, they weren't of high quality. Compare this to capitalist countries such as west Germany, Sweden or Finland were everybody too had apartments/houses of much better quality, bigger and faster cars, and no need to worry about society declaring coffee an unaffordable luxury.

By the way, did I mention that I have visited USSR? That place was ultra poor, actually DDR would have been in the same level if not the USSR would have subsidized them via selling them oil and gas under market prices and allowing DDR to sell oil to west, make profit out of the trade and get hard currency to subsidize living conditions in the country.",0,1376730154,null,0,false,0,cbpkuty,t3_1ki7k9,t1_cbpkuty,t1_cbpkpcd,null,1429798331,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Stalin and the communists didn't do jackshit. They inherited a great country which already had started to develop in enormous speed. If the communist revolution would have never happened, Russia would have developed much faster to an industrial power house and to a super power.

Lets put some figures behind this...

Energy consumption (in millions of metric tons of coal equivalent)

* 1890 - 10.9
* 1900 - 30
* 1910 - 41
* 1913 - 51
* 1920 - 14.3
* 1930 - 65
* 1938 - 177

Iron/Steel Production

* 1890 - 0.95
* 1900 - 2.2
* 1910 - 3.5
* 1913 - 4.8
* 1920 - 0.16
* 1930 - 5.7
* 1938 - 18

The thing is that Russian empire had much bigger growth figures than Stalin ever could achieve and with lower human costs. Russian empire in the last 3 decades was fueled by Russian entrepreneurs, foreign entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. If communists hadn't ever taken power, Russia would have followed the same development path as of US.

I'm not a Russophile in anyway, but credit should be given where it is due, Russian people before the revolution build in short time huge industrial machine and huge amounts of infrastructure that Stalin and communists inherited and leveraged.

What's most prominent there's no formal ""is this a date?"" thing. You meet through friends, in bars, or activities, do stuff together, and throw cues about things you could do together. 

Part of that is a well tuned ""I have to go"" radar - If you are on a walk with friends, and two of them fall back or go ahead, give them some space. If you hang out, and two of them end up on another table, you might end up leaving fore another place the second they got their next drinks.

Let me get this right... People in developed capitalistic countries can afford bigger apartments and houses, better and faster cars, more and better food including imported items, high-tech, gadget, etc... And they have even cleaner industries and environment. Compare this to [environmental catastrophes](http://www.rinr.fsu.edu/fallwinter99/features/sb_cleaningup.html) caused by communist regimes.

Everyone was equally poor, I don't think that is really desirable. Not to mention that the reason why there wasn't unemployment was because everyone was forced to have a job. Again compare this to capitalistic countries where there is a welfare system, people can easily afford to live unemployed and search the next thing that they want to do.

US Iron/Steel production

The thing is that the difference between US and Russia was the first enjoying fruits of globalization and international finance and trade for 50-60 years more than Russia. However Russia was following the same track as the US had gone and with additional foreign investments and letting capitalism progress in Russia. For example the best results that Stalin got from USSR from energy production to iron/steel production pales in comparison to shear might of the US productive capacity, not to mention that while people in USSR died and starved, ordinary people in the US was getting introduced to joys of consumption society already in the early years of 20th century.",0,1376734735,null,0,false,0,cbpldfb,t3_1ki7k9,t1_cbpldfb,t1_cbpl5ii,null,1429798090,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Cannabis is legal in the Netherlands and it's not like you have problems associated to it.

And what about the legal competition they'd face? You wouldn't need to finance the drug cartels if you were free to cultivate your own pot in your backyard or you could buy it from other less shady people.

Yeah, I've seen videos of them reading sentences and cutting off people's heads while they scream, it's actually completely sickening.

But how do actually cut back on their power? It certainly won't be with harsher sentences and more policing, heck, that would be making things even worse. The only way you have to completely destroying them is to make it legal, that's what happened with the alcohol prohibition in the USA, when it was legal there were never any problems, you made it illegal and you had the gangsters and people like Al Capone got to have a lot of power and you had things like the Saint Valentine's day massacre, you made it legal again and all that went away.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I would prefer that. Too many unskilled temporary workers got mortgages in my country. 5 years ago temporary workers earning €1,200 got mortgages for €200,000 apartments and asking for more mortgage that needed was common to buy a fancy car.

The problem wasn't temporary workers getting loans, it was meddling of politicians and constructors to management of savings banks that made the banks give bigger loans to customers than customers could really afford. That is why savings banks in all around Spain have been going bust, on the other hand big commercial banks like Santander actually did know what they were doing because they could held against state/politicians intervention.

What is an good idea is that states clamp down on corruption and upholding laws and getting rid of legislation that is straight out harmful. For example in Spain legislation that was meant to protect renters, was so strict, so complex and so costly that is had withered rental markets.

Another issue I want to note is putting up too tight banking regulation can very easily lead to decrease of social mobility. Essentially if you put up too high equity or collateral demands, then only wealthy or children of wealthy people will be ones that are able to loan money. For example that temporary worker earning 1200€ shouldn't get 200000€ loan, but a loan of 50000 to 75000 with 25 year payback time he should get, maybe due to his conditions it would sub-prime mortgage, but it would still allow him to save capital and build up his social/economic advancement.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; But not sure that explains it, if I remember Copenhagen on weekends, the swedes do not have less of that problem and are much lower on the statistics (and yes, meant Copenhagen in Danmark and swedes).

Some Swedes go to Copenhagen to drink on weekends. So it obviously is a subgroup of Swedes in a specific circumstances, and not a good basis for making general comparisons to whole Finland.

If we [compare the cities](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1kimp9/eu_homicide_rate_per_100_000_population/cbperxu) during 2006-2010 the homicide rates in Copenhagen (1.6) and in Helsinki (1.7) were not much different.

In 2012 there were 89 homicides in Finland with a rate of 1.6, and they are on a long term declining trend. About 18% of homicides are commited with firearms the most common weapon being knife.

MrPeachy is correct, the homicide rate in Finland is closely related to alcoholism. But that does not mean that the Finns are violent, murderous alcoholics. What we have in those numbers is a subgroup overrepresented. 

A typical Finnish homicide is committed by a drunk, low educated, middle-aged, unemployed alcoholic who assaults his associate in a drinking group. These cases represent over 75% of all homicides in Finland, and most of them happen in economically poorer Eastern and Northern provinces.

Homicide in Finland is indeed peculiar compared to other Nordics. 

In Finland about 75-85% of all homicides are related to alcoholism, and are typically committed by a drunk, low educated, middle-aged, unemployed alcoholic who assaults his associate in a drinking group.

But in Sweden only little over half of homicides are related to alcohol.

There is no simple answer as to why that is. This paper gives some pointers to the various factors that might be at play: [Alcohol as a causal criminogenic factor: The Scandinavian experience.](http://www.rpkab.se/Alcoholandcrime.htm)

I'm a German male, married to a US female - so cross-breeding does happen occasionally. :-)

We met several times in my old college ""WG"" and sparks were flying and we ended up going on something like a date - because I felt like she was expecting that, it was far from my first relationship but my first classic ""date"". It was rather awkward and uncomfortable and I was mostly confused because I pretty much only knew this from US movies and they usually cut those down for length - we ran out of stuff to talk about after five minutes.

Instead of the playful and flirting banter that we engaged in when we first met it was suddenly incredibly hard to keep a conversation going (especially since expected German and American ""small talk"" differs greatly).

Apparently she thought the date went even worse than I did and just wanted to go home ... only when we were in the car on the way to her dorm did the ice melt again, in the end I kissed her and twelve years later we are (still) happily married.

Dating in Germany is a whole lot less ritualistic and a whole lot slower. One meets frequently and flirts in a more subtle manner that apparently isn't entirely obvious to all foreigners (I never understood how my now wife could have ever gotten the impression that I wasn't interested in her when I made it so incredibly obvious in my German mind).

This usually happens in a setting where both are comfortable and rarely without other friends around, the whole ""dinner and a movie"" kind of courtship usually happens *after* both have decided that they are now a couple and not before.

If, as a German, I were interested in you, I'd flirt with you and try to get you to do things with my circle of friends - invite you to parties etc. and generally seek more opportunities for flirting rather than outright asking you on a ""date"", that may not happen for weeks and only after both are completely and utterly comfortable with each other.

[What the UK charges for a visa from Spain into the UK](http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2013/august/spain-threatens-gibraltar-with-environmental-fines/78050.aspx) particularly important is the bit on territorial waters.

The Spanish Foreign minister is  also threatening a 50 Euro crossing fee from Gibraltar which would likely break EU regulations.

Personally I feel that the Spanish government are playing a dangerous game. Not in terms of asking for war. But economic wise, particularly tourism and food exports to the UK, whilst Gibraltar is a separate entity to the UK it is a British Overseas Territory. and the UK is rather protective of BOTs.

Per il passato, si puo' usare ""scoppia il/un casino"": 

- ""When they found out, shit really hit the fan""=""quando l'hanno scoperto, e' scoppiato un casino""

Just like you said, the SPD and CDU aren't all that different.  For that reason it was the SPD that ushered in neo-liberal reform under Schröder while the CDU just watched.  Similarly in the UK the labor party did similar things under Blair.    The reason for this is that in Western countries democracy has become an insider game of rigging the system to meet your own establishment's needs.

Take party revenue, which has gone way way way up in the past ten years (didn't even take a dip during the crisis).  It also prohibits meaningful change.  I don't remember his name, but one of the SPD MP who was big behind the Klimawendel basically had to run under Direktmandat because the SPD punished him from breaking with party line.  

The main different with Germany (and this is a good thing) is its mixed-member proportional system that allows for a larger amount of parties to be represented and widens the debate and creates more diversity.  However, this is easily done away with when one realizes the SPD and CDU have basically shared power the past 60 or so years.  

The best way to fix this would be to institute direct party lists, like they did in Hamburg.  And you can see exactly why they didn't want that, because the party wants control over the political landscape.  And let's not fool ourselves, the parties are big business and haven't had the interests of the people in mind for a while.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt; QMV

It's factually called Qualified Majority Voting, and it appears you are using to argue that the EU is federal because a sovereign state can be outvoted.

While majority voting is indeed a federal element of the EU, does this give us the ""federal EU"" picture you painted, and which I referred to as a 'scare tactic'?

No, it doesn't, and there's the nub of the argument. Yes, to an ardent sovereigntist, anything other than intergovernmentalism (with each state having a veto) is wrong, but it has been adopted not as part of the glorious federalist march to the dissolution of the nation-states but because intergovernmentalism is as inefficient between nations as it is anywhere else. We would not attempt to run our parliaments on the basis of each MP having a veto, and you can't run something like the EU on that basis either.

I'll make the point again, which is that I'm not a federalist, but I do regard as very silly the ardent sovereigntist's anathema of anything that abridges absolute national sovereignty. Equating QMV with federalism broadens the definition of federalism to a point where it encompasses virtually everything that is not Westphalian absolutism, whose perniciousness has indeed been repeatedly proven, and which needs to be consigned to the dustbin of history along with its intellectual companion and supporter Social Darwinism.

Has the quality of life in Russia become better since the fall of the USSR? Perhaps not as sensationally as capitalists would like to have hoped.

I'll note that Cuba, arguably the closest to a Marxist-Leninist state we have today, is the most economically successful country in the Caribbean, with the best standard of living; its literacy and infant death rates are better than some European countries. The fact that its wage rate and GDP per capita are not on par with the United States is a false comparison, because it did not wield an advanced economy like that before the revolution, either.

- per pagare le tasse nel paese in cui sei andato a vivere devi essere iscritto all'AIRE e devi risiedere in quel paese per un tot all'anno. Se ti iscrivi all'AIRE devi non avere interessi in italia. Però ti permettono di possedere una prima casa in Italia e avere alcuni sgravi. La prima casa potresti averla comprata con un mutuo. Il mutuo è collegato ad un conto corrente italiano (ovviamente). Il conto corrente (a regola) non potresti averlo. Soluzione? Non ne hanno. 
- se lavori come freelance in Italia, ti sposti a vivere all'estero, fai tutto in regola e apri una partita iva straniera (ma continui a lavorare con i clienti che avevi, italiani) in automatico l'Agenzia delle Entrate crede che non vivi per davvero all'estero ma che stai cercando di fregarli. Di default. E di default ti trovi il controllino. E poi glielo devi spiegare PER BENE che non stai cercando di fregarli. Il funzionario del Consolato mi ha detto che l'unica maniera è citare nelle risposte direttamente il nome del dipendente dell'Agenzia che ti sta tartassando (se lo trovi) - li responsabilizza, dice.
- Magari allora decidi di rimanere cittadino italiano all'estero residente in Italia. Bravo, prova a muovere del denaro verso il tuo conto corrente all'estero, per vivere.

Bei uns an der Uni ist es so, dass alle Professoren/Mitarbeiter zwingend von dir verlangen mit deiner studentischen E-Mail Adresse zu kommunizieren. Vielleicht meinte der Mitarbeiter auch das. Gut möglich.

Nein es geht um die verschlüsselte Kommunikation zwischen Mailservern. Z.b. wenn ich von Google Mail zu meinem Server eine E-Mail sende, dann wird diese E-Mail mit [Perfect Forward Secrecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy)  verschlüsselt übertragen. Das bedeutet, wenn jemand *passiv* lauscht (z.B. am einem Internetknoten) dann sieht er nur, dass eine E-Mail von IP A nach IP B verschickt wurde aber nicht den Inhalt der E-Mail. Wenn er mitloggt und irgendwann die Private-Keys von Google bekommt, dann ist die E-Mail immer noch nicht entschlüsselbar. 

Die meisten Uni-Mailserver bieten kein TLS für eingehende und abgehende E-Mails an. D.h. ein Geheimdienst kann diese E-Mails lesen und auswerten - das was XKeyScore macht. 

Natürlich ist der Zugang zu POP3/IMAP und dem Webmail Interface verschlüsselt. Das hindert deinem Nachbarn und deinem Provider daran den Inhalt zu sehen aber nicht ein Geheimdienst im Rechnenzentrum. 

aber TLS für E-Mail ist zusätzlich noch durch MITM-Attacken angreifbar, da die erste Kommunikation über reinen Text funktioniert kann man das STARTTLS einfach rausfiltern. Alternativ kann man es erzwingen, dass wird uns gerade als De-Mail verkauft. 

Was ich eigentlich sagen wollte, ist dass des technisch nichts bringt US Mailanbieter zu verbieten solange man E-Mails nicht auf Mailserverebene verschlüsselt versenden und empfangen kann. 

Wenn der Mitarbeiter sich informiert hätte, dann würde er einen PGP-Key auf seiner Seite anbieten und auf ein Tutorial zur PGP-Nutzung verlinken.

Das passiert noch bevor überhaupt der Mailserver die ganzen Header der E-Mail gelesen hat. Also ich würde sagen: Nein.~~ Ich bin heute etwas verpeilt. 

Also wenn es einen Header gäbe dann könnte man das schon umsetzen, da ja der Mailserver wissen muss wohin die E-Mail verschickt wird und vor dem Verbindungsaufbau den Header prüfen könnte. Nur gibt es soweit ich weiß keinen derartigen Header der akzeptiert wäre. Zudem kannst du das nur überprüfen bis zum ersten Mailserver, der wiederum kann aber eh deine E-Mails als Klartext wieder woanders hinschicken. Wirklich gut und sicher ist das alles nicht.

Was du natürlich machen kannst ist einen eigenen Mailserver aufsetzen z.B. mit postfix und in der Konfiguration erzwingen, dass E-Mails zu anderen Mailservern nur verschickt werden wenn verschlüsselt kommuniziert werden kann. Das Problem ist hier, dass das Momentan sehr wenige Mailserver können und zum anderen kannst du nicht sicher sein Opfer einer MITM-Attacke zu werden, da die Server Zertifikate nicht validiert werden. Wenn du das noch aktivierst dann kannst du mit so gut wie niemanden mehr kommunizieren. 

In einer idealen Welt hätte jeder Mailserver ein signiertes Zertifikat und das würde vor dem Datenaustausch validiert werden... 

Das einzige was technisch halbwegs sicher ist (wenn man mal von Metadaten absieht) ist Ende zu Ende verschlüsselung via PGP und S/MIME. Mit einer Kombination von TLS und PGP ist man immerhin so weit, dass ein passiver Mithöhrer nur noch eine Zuordnung zwischen 2 IP-Adressen machen kann und nicht mehr z.B. die E-Mail Adressen oder weitere Empfänger mitbekommt.

It's very true that some people may have similar sentiments about the blacks in USA. Or about Chechens in Russia. Heck, even about Lithuanians in Denmark. It's convenient to jump to quick conclusions based on crime statistics, but failing to see underlying social problems and disregarding historical factors which drive immigrant communities to criminal lifestyle and sometimes even make whole nations more prone to crime problem, makes it so fucking easy to slap a single word over a complex problem.

I'm not a terribly naive person, nor I'm overly politically correct. And I perfectly understand that there are huge problems with crime *inside* Russia. Murder stats there are probably way worse than in the Baltics. But drawing such single-worded conclusions loaded with prejudice is inappropriate towards all nice law abiding Russians. And what if I told you that being kept in the same Soviet prison for 50 years, Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians, we ourselves became a bit more violent and more likely to commit murder?

Let me tell you a different story about Visaginas, the *only* town in Lithuania where majority of population are ethnic Russians. It is a planned settlement of 20k residents, which was built during the Soviet occupation to house staff of a nearby nuclear plant. A big portion of the population are well educated engineers and qualified workers. It is a very nice community, the town is perfectly clean and high school students are constantly getting the best marks in secondary education exams in entire Lithuania. It's perfectly clear that educated families create a good environment for their children. But one could just jump to a quicker conclusion, 'Russians'. But that wouldn't be right, would it?

&gt;While majority voting is indeed a federal element of the EU, does this give us the ""federal EU"" picture you painted, and which I referred to as a 'scare tactic'?

Clearly YES.

It was a federal element, and it is an element that has been evolved as a matter of PROCESS, upto the point they're now rephrasing it as 'norm voting'.  So what you accept as federalist in nature is now being used as 'norm'.

&gt;No, it doesn't, and there's the nub of the argument. Yes, to an ardent sovereigntist, anything other than intergovernmentalism (with each state having a veto) is wrong, 

They're you go again claiming something contrary to arguments I've quoted.

&gt; We would not attempt to run our parliaments on the basis of each MP having a veto, and you can't run something like the EU on that basis either.

Only we're not talking about single representatives, we're talking about sovereign states losing sovereignty.   

&gt; Equating QMV with federalism broadens the definition of federalism to a point where it encompasses virtually everything that is not Westphalian absolutism,

Meanwhile in the 21st century every other trading bloc and trading continent are consistently growing whilst Europe is stuck in a malaise platitude, because in the 21st century tariffs have gone down whilst the EU practices protectionism.

We've talked about it in one of my philosophy classes. I won't bore you guys with the topic of the lecture, so...the film depicts three different generations, WWII, the Communist years and post communism through the life of three characters, father, son, grandson. You could interpret it in the sense that the main characters' situation, life, bodies each represent the state of the country in the specific period the characters live in. Think of it as social criticism and satire, both of how things were in Hungary during the three periods, but it also criticises the West and how they perceive a post communist country.

Jaja, einmal mehr die Mär von friedlichen Protesten.  Dass dabei [Muslimbrüder zuweilen aus der Menge heraus auf Sicherheitskräfte feuern](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK3Akd8RFIU), schert Schreiberlinge wie Hubert Wetzel nicht, von abgefackelten Kirchen ganz zu schweigen.

&gt; Mursi war ein unfähiger, unbelehrbarer, islamistischer Präsident. Aber er war eben der gewählte Präsident - ein Status, der aus Sicht der westlichen Demokratien einen gewissen Wert haben sollte.

Von einem Journalisten aus Deutschland sollte man etwas mehr historisches Reflexionsvermögen erwarten können: Als der Hitler ebenda das Ruder an sich riss, wäre ein Militärputsch die einzige Möglichkeit gewesen, den sich anbahnenden Krieg von innen zu verhindern.  Allein die Eigenschaft, gewählt zu sein, legitimiert nicht jede Schandtat, insbesondere wenn es um einen so bedeutsamen Akt wie den der Verfassungsgebung geht.  Die Muslimbruderschaft hat ihren Unwillen zu echter Demokratie demonstriert, und sie wollte den Staat von vornherein auf ihren Islamismus eichen.

Was bei alledem unter den Tisch fällt, ist die Frage, ob in Ägypten überhaupt die Voraussetzungen für eine vernünftig funktionierende Demokratie gegeben sind.  Alljene, die davon überzeugt sind, täten gut daran, ihre Ansicht einmal schriftlich zu begründen.  Im Westen vollzog sich die Demokratisierung im Gefolge einer Verbürgerlichung und einer damit einhergehenden Aufklärung; ebenso eine Rolle spielten in ihrer Blutigkeit nicht zu übertreffende Religionskriege, die tiefe Eindrücke im gesellschaftlichen Gedächtnis hinterlassen und das Fundament für die Auffassung gelegt hatten, dass Religion Privatsache zu sein habe.  Äquivalente Prozesse kann ich in der jüngeren ägyptischen Geschichte nicht erkennen; allerdings fehlt mir dazu, um ganz offen zu sein, auch die Expertise.

Plus they have their own section). But that being said, as a 30-something you won't get any odd looks and you will have fun. Check my post history, I've written one or two well received Oktoberfest 101 posts. [Here is one](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1g0ssx/i_have_some_questions_about_oktoberfest/caftbzz). [Here is another, mostly about how much fun it is](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1b8p03/want_to_go_to_oktoberfest_this_year_need_tips_and/c94slmy). Check out the threads they are in, there might be some useful information.

Other favourite tents of mine: Hacker and Schützen. 

Don't go to Armbrustschützen, it's lame. So is the Augustiner tent in my experience. Hippodrom is filled with pseudo-celebs and their annoying fans. Hofbräu is where all the tourists go. Käfer is for the local high society (soccer players, actors, etc.). The Weinzelt serves wine, which can be a nice change of pace, but I wouldn't recommend it for a one-time-only Oktoberfest visit. Never actually been to Ochsenbraterei, but I hear their Ochsensemmel (a bun with ox meat in it) is amazing. There's a couple of other tents, but they are so insignifcant that I can't for the life of me remember their names.

Things to do: Tip your waitress and be nice to her. She alone decides when you get your next beer. Eat a Hendl (one half of a chicken). Dance on the benches. Tip your waitress and be nice to her. Sing ""Ein Prosit, ein Prosit der Gemütlichkeit. Ein Prosit, ein Pro-ho-sit der Gemüüüt-lich-keit. Eins, zwei, drei, g'suffa"". Learn those words, trust me. It'll come up roughly every 15 minutes. Tip your waitress and be nice to her.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;It was a federal element, and it is an element that has been evolved as a matter of PROCESS, upto the point they're now rephrasing it as 'norm voting'. So what you accept as federalist in nature is now being used as 'norm'.

But this argument is the classic ""slippery slope"" argument that movement in a particular direction can simply be extrapolated to whatever degree one likes. You've basically stated that the EU now contains more federal elements than it did ten years ago, which is true, and that federalists say federalist things, which is also true.

Can you go from that to the conclusion that the EU will therefore necessarily become a fully federal system? Not logically, no, because there is no such inevitability. You believe that it will, because you believe the EU is *already* successfully being pushed forward by federalists, as evidence of which, you connect two things - increased federal elements, and statements by federalists. 

So the statements by federalists are evidence of a federalist agenda, and the increase in federalist elements in the EU is evidence of the success of that agenda, and you therefore confidently predict further federalism because what you see is that the EU is being driven by an already successful federalist agenda.

Is it possible to disprove that circle? No, it never is. All one can observe is that the federalists are not actually in charge, that their agenda is just one agenda, that it can only go as far as people want, and that people don't want* the logical outcome that can be extrapolated from it, and that it therefore won't* happen. 

* The caveat there, of course, is that they *currently* don't want it, and therefore it *currently* won't happen. If the majority come to want it, then presumably it will happen, but under those circumstances I can't really see a valid objection to it happening.

&gt; Der Frankfurter Vize-Polizeipräsident Wolfgang Daschner soll angeordnet
 haben, dem mutmaßlichen Täter Magnus G. bei der Frage nach dem Verbleib
 des entführten Jungen mitzuteilen, dass man ihm wehtun werde, wenn er
 keine Aussage machen würde. Konkret sollte der zuständige
 Kriminalhauptkommissar angeblich dem Verdächtigen ankündigen:
 ""Wenn Sie jetzt nicht reden, dann werden wir Ihnen große Schmerzen
 zufügen...wie Sie nie welche hatten, die Sie nie in Ihrem Leben
 vergessen werden."" 

&gt;Dem Berliner ""Tagesspiegel"" zufolge soll ein
 Vermerk Daschners existieren, dass Magnus G. ""nach vorheriger
 Androhung, unter ärztlicher Aufsicht, durch Zufügung von Schmerzen
 (keine Verletzungen) erneut zu befragen ist"".

So my posts were all tongue-in-cheek, thought you were full-time Romanian.

Regardless to one's relationship with this country, Sibiu county is a place to see, it's littered with beautiful, unusual and curious places.

Sibiu itself is a gorgeous medieval city with cathedrals and all, museums galore, and a huge - 100ha - ""peasant tech museum"" (Astra, must see, take the tram towards Rasinari). There's a good number of medieval fortified churches around the county, including the one in Cristian - the one locality where streets are ""named"" with Roman numerals - [that's](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Cristian,+Sibiu,+Romania&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=45.788534,24.031219&amp;spn=0.045187,0.104628&amp;sll=40.580585,-5.976562&amp;sspn=49.836177,107.138672&amp;oq=cristian&amp;hnear=Cristian,+Sibiu,+Romania&amp;t=m&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=45.78845,24.031124&amp;panoid=g5_C7JBk5l1Rp_3E4pRbsw&amp;cbp=12,317.37,,3,-1.19) ""Tenth Street"", not ""Street Ecs"". There's Paltinis and Cheile Cibinului and whatnot. One of my favourite holidays ever (I even said that on TV, a station had some reporting running in the village I was living in, and found me all enthusiastic sweating towards one of the hiking routes).

As for /r/wtf, yeah, we get coverage there, but we are a *wtf* nation, for better and worse. The last two people on Earth will be two Romanians, nudging and sniggering at the mushroom cloud.

It's just to get like-minded women together, like all other subreddits exist to group like-minded individuals together.  Americans are welcome, but US topics just won't be the focus, as they tend to be in all the other women-oriented subs.

Yes, I was probably rather peeved when I came up with the idea, but that was mostly due to the frustration that came with not really finding a relevant outlet for some topics I wanted to discuss that didn't really fit in anywhere else.

I by no means want to exclude anyone from the sub, but used ""international"" to just distinguish it from what's 'regular', and on Reddit, an American website, 'regular' is American.  Since not all users are American, however, I thought it would be nice to have a place that was more focussed on their views/topics. 

TwoX does occasionally have stories from around the world, but they don't get nearly as much traffic/discussion as 'domestic' stories.  There was a discussion about whether non-North American women get enough representation online (albeit this was black women) on [/r/blackladies ](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/1ikssb/nonnorth_american_blackladies_do_you_ever_feel_as/) recently, where issues about being non-American on Reddit came up.  People suggested that non-Americans simply post anyway, as all posts are welcome, but the posters countered that the responses they got were US-specific anyway.  Which is totally understandable when you're in a US-based sub. 

So, the thinking is that if you have a specific sub that's geared towards other places than the US, and you aren't from the US, then you'll be more likely to find useful responses there.  And if you *are* from the US, then you can see what everyone else is up to.

I wasn't trying to be divisive, but just offer an alternative outlet to women on Reddit who don't really feel like they fit in with the women's subs already available, because those tend to be heavily American.

Tout à fait, c'est d'ailleurs pour cela qu'on a de grands instituts nationnaux alors que les Brits par exemple n'ont que des enseignants-chercheurs. Oh wait ! En fait non, il y a eu une politique de développement de la recherche et de construction d'entités prestigieuses : quand on interviewe quelqu'un à la télé et qu'on dit qu'il est CNRS, il y a tout de suite une forme de légitimité à l'esprit du spectateur. Et elle ne sort pas de nulle part.

&gt; en Allemagne où des pères de famille de 40 ans retournent chercher un doctorat

La relation au doctorat est, je trouve, particulièrement malsaine en Allemagne : ça devient un truc que tu affiches partout (jusque sur ta carte bancaire !) pour montrer à quel point tu es au dessus de la foule. Le délire est tel que pour faire de la politique à un haut niveau, ça devient presque obligatoire (et après on se tape des scandales au niveau du plagiat... wouhou quel système vertueux pour la recherche !).

&gt; Le brain-drain qui en résulte, c'est un arbitrage purement individuel et individualiste.

Tu le vois comme un choix purement économique (partir avec un plus gros capital), je le vois avant tout comme un moyen de travailler dans de bonnes conditions. Si on doit se taper un petit chef local qui peut décider des promotions (comme c'était déjà le cas en UK) et un pouvoir politique qui dénigre les chercheurs alors autant travailler dans une structure qui a les moyens d'équiper correctement ses locaux. On en arrive à un point où c'est ridicule : voici un extrait d'un communiqué de l'intersyndicale d'un prestigieux établissement de recherche français à la veille du CA préparant le budget 2013.

*« Nous ne prendrons qu'un seul exemple. Depuis plusieurs mois le service maintenance n'a plus les moyens nécessaires pour changer les ampoules manquantes dans de nombreux bâtiments. Une conséquence extrêmement visible et fâcheuse de ce manque de moyens, est l'absence d'éclairage, ou le sous-éclairage de certains bâtiments. Des collègues de plusieurs services (logistique, recherche, etc.) sont obligé-e-s de travailler dans le noir, ou de condamner certaines pièces. »*

Et c'est bien la LRU (donc la politique de Sarkozy, mais rassure-toi Hollande ne va rien faire de mieux) qui, dans la droite ligne des politiques de décentralisation, organise cet appauvrissement en transférant les compétences mais pas les budgets qui vont avec.

The claim that Hungary's wars were almost exclusively defensive is not true.

Granted, the post most likely refers to the Kingdom era but that would open up a whole different can of worms and I don't think /r/Europe is interested in reading an entire essay regarding feudal power struggles. 

The Kingdom of Hungary didn't sacrifice itself to halt Ottoman expansionism. To put it short, internal power struggles left the kingdom defenseless and when push came to shove, in this case push being the Ottomans, the Hungarians lost. This led to the hungarian nobility electing two kings at the same time which, coupled with the Ottoman occupation of central Hungary, divided the country into three parts.

true,Lacanomics,null,null,"&gt;Tout à fait, c'est d'ailleurs pour cela qu'on a de grands instituts nationnaux alors que les Brits par exemple n'ont que des enseignants-chercheurs.

Quel rapport avec la valorisation de la recherche ? La recherche est une affaire de chercheurs, les mille et un noms et structures que l'administration sait pondre n'ont quasiment aucun impact. On peut valoriser quelque chose et pas forcément savoir la faire soi-même. 

&gt;En fait non, il y a eu une politique de développement de la recherche et de construction d'entités prestigieuses : quand on interviewe quelqu'un à la télé et qu'on dit qu'il est CNRS, il y a tout de suite une forme de légitimité à l'esprit du spectateur. Et elle ne sort pas de nulle part.

C'est pas le téléspectateur qui organise l'Etat. Bonjour les arguments. Et puis le CNRS, c'est quel % des chercheurs français. C'est tellement important qu'il n'y a plus aucune différence entre le statut de chercheur en France et celui de chercheur au CNRS ( à part quelques chasses gardées comme le nucléaire ). Le CNRS est une mauvaise béquille qui désolidarise les chercheurs de leur fonction d'enseignement et vice versa. Mais on n'est pas vraiment là pour parler du CNRS, non ? 

&gt;Tu le vois comme un choix purement économique (partir avec un plus gros capital), je le vois avant tout comme un moyen de travailler dans de bonnes conditions. 

Non, il y a indéniablement les deux. On forme des docteurs à qui on ne donne pas les moyens d'exercer leur métier avec un recrutement opaque et par cooptation. L'augmentation de la valeur du ""patrimoine"" éducatif résulte aussi en une augmentation des responsabilités et de la condisération qu'on leur porte donc plus de moyens. Mais je ne suis pas certain que les conditions réelles d'exercice soient vraiment meilleures ailleurs. Pour les structures compétitives, la charge de travail aux US ou Uk est délirante.

&gt;On en arrive à un point où c'est ridicule : voici un extrait d'un communiqué de l'intersyndicale d'un prestigieux établissement de recherche français à la veille du CA préparant le budget 2013.

Je prendrais avec des pincettes le communiqué d'un syndicat qui n'arrive pas à faire mettre des ampoules dans des locaux. J'entends parfaitement les dénonciations du manque de moyens ( même si l'argent public qui part dans la recherche est à niveau ), mais l'analyse et la façon dont l'anecdote est présentée laisse plus entendre à du sabotage ( ouvrier de la maintenance toujours absent et qui n'a pas fait les commandes ) qu'à une réelle critique de fond. Je le sais, j'en ai aussi fait l'expérience. Jouer le paupérisme comme au 19e siècle met bien en lumière la nocivité et la toxicité de ces individus qui n'ont que des historiettes et des petits coups de couteaux dans le dos à invoquer mais peu de désir d'avancer ( comme dans toutes les grosses structures ""historiques"" françaises, par ailleurs ).

So... it's natural that cultural aspect would express itself in those two areas you mention - gay marriage and drug legalization. 

Please understand, however, that gay marriage and drug legalization are still something like gray areas in the USA, even in those jurisdictions which have made legislation in that direction. When there are conflicting laws at different levels of government, there is no certainty. In contrast to this effect, Canada instituted gay marriage from sea to sea eight years ago, and there doesn't seem to be any controversy about the matter up there, today.

That all said, the free-wheeling attitude of Americans leads to people who often will not discuss things rationally in the way Germans do, but instead will dive totally into emotional and even rancorous debate. I can tell you that this is not at all good for a nation's spirit, or its direction. 

Because of the way my fellow Americans discuss things, the USA ends up with basically no foresight. It will only institute policies to correct bad practices when the society feels pain. The ballooning US national debt is a current example of this lack of foresight. Another is the lack of seriousness accorded the prospect of global climate change. One historical example, is the financial laws which gave our country such a successful economy in the 1900s; these were put in place in light of the events of the 1930s ""Great Depression."" A lot of those policies have been repealed in recent years, and somehow Americans are taken by surprise when disasters result. 

In practice, however, when you wait to reform policy until the disaster strikes, you actually have more flexibility and more freedom, and the policies you do enact are quite effective. 

&gt; the average German is more ...  than the average American

And yes, in contrast to other Western countries, the USA and Canada have specifically made it their personal soul-searching project for decades upon decades to embrace the multi-cultural society. Every time I hear a continental European say that ""We can see how multiculturalism has failed in the UK,"" I want to tell her or him to come to North America, where I live, and see where it has worked.

true,Mshotts,UNSA,United States of America,"Lack of necessity for most people. They're worried about working 2 or 3 jobs so they can scrape by to keep their shit house in a shit neighborhood. So they can send their kids to a shit school with no supplies. So they can keep shit food that's packed with who knows what on their table. Maybe they're trying to save up enough to be able to see a doctor to check out their daughters ear that's been infected for quite some time. 

They also went to those shit schools and got a shit education, not that they were paying much attention anyway. Shit gets rough when you're expected to have a job at the age of 15 (when I was 16 I was working full time and still had a full day at school, it was unheard of for someone to not have a job). Maybe they dropped out so they could work even more. 

Now, our hypothetical family wants to go on vacation. We're limited to about two or three days because let's be real here you don't get any vacation time and can't afford to miss a day of work. Let's assume our family lives in Kansas City (relatively the middle of the country), Canada is about 1600 km away and Mexico is about 1800 km away, that's just to get to border towns mind you. Forget about hopping on a plane to the UK or Japan, the cost of just one ticket is more than you make at your two jobs in three months. Looks like we're just going to go to the local city for a night out. Maybe we can go visit out of state family but that's about it.

The only time you learn about a new country is when you're told your sons are needed to go ""fight for our freedom"" in some strange foreign land. 

I come from a decent sized village (about 30,000) and it's very uncommon for people to leave once they reach adulthood. Once you turn 18 you're generally expected to begin working on finding your own place to live and begin starting a family. Plenty of people I graduated high school with (let alone the ones my age who dropped out) are already married and have children and I'm only 20. I'm one of the rare few who got out and I'm by no means at the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid.

Higher education? Impossible for many. I go to a *public* university and my tuition is $28,000 per *year* (and that's about middle of the road, tuition is $50,000/year at many places). I'm only able to do it because I'm taking on a shitload of debt which I'm having to gamble on being able to pay off. Student loan debt? Yeah, you can't get rid of that even if you declare bankruptcy and the bank can legally take money from your paycheck before you receive it. 

It really is unfortunate that it's the state of affairs in the U.S. Is the U.S. a great country to be upper middle class or rich in? Absolutely. However, I think many of you forget just how shit it is to be poor in the U.S. absolutely *nobody* gives a fuck about you. Not your government or fellow countrymen that's for damn sure.

I got a really bad stomach pain last year. It got worst every minute and this was the first time I had to call for an ambulance because I had difficulty to breath because of the pain. At that time, i did not know how it really works but I was aware it was basically free. 

The ambulance came and they took me to the nearest emergencies. Once I arrived, i was checked by a doctor who gave me the first drug to calm the pain. 10 minutes later, i was laying on a bed, with an intravenous injection. A doctor spent nearly 30 minutes with me, asking me question about my pain, my medical history. I had 2 different drugs and the pain finally vanish. Meanwhile, they called my both parents to reassure them and on my call they asked a friend to come. 
When I was about to leave, I thought i had, at least, to pay something for the ambulance or the drugs. Nope. I went straight home and they sent a ~100 euros bill a few days later that was fully paid by the different coverage (Only the basic one if i remember well).

&gt;A [contagious shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagious_shooting) is a sociological phenomenon observed in military and police personnel in the United States, in which one person firing on a target can induce others to begin shooting. Often the subsequent shooters will not know why they are firing.

Wie anders willst du es erklären, wenn Polizisten wie besessen auf Verdächtige schießen, die selber nicht bewaffnet sind, noch in der Lage Widerstand zu leisten?  Und wenn die Magazine leer sind, die Opfer schon am Boden liegen, dann wird trotzdem noch nachgeladen und weiter geballert:

&gt;The [Sean Bell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bell) shooting incident took place in the New York City borough of Queens, New York, United States on November 25, 2006, when three men were shot at a total of fifty times by a team of both plainclothes and undercover NYPD officers, killing one of the men, Sean Bell, on the morning before his wedding, and severely wounding two of his friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman.

&gt;[Amadou Bailo Diallo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadou_Diallo_shooting) (September 2, 1975 – February 4, 1999) was a 23-year-old immigrant from Guinea who was shot and killed in New York City on February 4, 1999 by four New York City Police Department plain-clothed officers: Sean Carroll, Richard Murphy, Edward McMellon and Kenneth Boss, who fired a combined total of 41 shots, 19 of which struck Diallo, outside his apartment at 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section of The Bronx. The four were part of the now-defunct Street Crimes Unit.

&gt;Diallo was unarmed at the time of the shooting, and a firestorm of controversy erupted subsequent to the event as the circumstances of the shooting prompted outrage both within and outs

true,[deleted],null,null,"Discrimination and experiences in society aren't based on biological facts. LGBT includes trans* and intersex people because they face very similar oppression (even more so than gay people). And if you look at LGBT history, it becomes even more obvious. The Stonewall riots were about people not conforming to norms of gender expression, and set the civil rights movement for queer people in motion. The LGBT community owes a lot to genderqueer people.


And with all due respect, you may doubt, but your sexual orientation is in fact *very* closely linked to your gender identity. Not for everyone, but for many. 
Some report knowing that they were gay or straight before they knew they were trans (e.g. a trans woman knowing she was a lesbian before she knew she was a woman), and even more report their orientation changing during or after transition.

The answer is just not that easy.


Political correctness means to me not being an asshole to people. I try to be nice most of the time. 
It doesn't hurt me to inform myself (not only on the terms but also current situation and such). 
I'm a white gay male. I'm also a very busy person. And still I know the preferred terms for people of color in two languages, I've informed myself about the history of these minorities in my home country and the US, and I think that's an important part in fighting racism. I don't expect a cookie for it, but I expect at least the same from other people.

It's also seriously not hard to keep up with the terms people prefer. If you inform yourself about their issues, knowing the terms comes automatically. Most people I know who refuse to learn the terms don't know anything at all about minorities in general though. So that's a problem I think. 
And if someone outright tells you ""don't use that word please, it's hurtful"", and you do it anyway ... well, that's your right. No one can take that away from you. I just hope you're not surprised if people call you inconsiderate or maybe even a dick, because that's their right.

You're not creating art by calling an intersex person by a word that's only used for animals and plants. Language is powerful, and it's never ""just words"". Words have an effect, and I think you understand that, because you compare speaking to being an artist - and you're a writer. So you *know*. (At this point I'd like to mention that I'm a writer, too. I'm also a linguist and language teacher. Language and words are my passion, my job, and my hobby. In short, my life.). Words can bully gay teens into suicide, can make you happy, can break you, can make you feel less than human. I'm not saying this for dramatic effect, I'm really literally saying they can make you feel less than human - and that's an awful feeling. I hope no one in your life ever made you feel that way, but in any case, I ask you to sympathize. You see people calling trans* and intersex people ""it"" and ""thing"" every day, and that is cruel. ""Hermaphrodite"" is just another word that wears you down a little further, even if that wasn't the intention of the speaker.

I just think it's kind of ironic that we're discussing the politically correct use of the English language on the German subreddit. Germans aren't so full of social drama that they are sensitive in quite the same manner. Words are very frank things in Germany. They are tools for discussing things - they are not blunt instruments to use for insulting or for venting one's emotions.

Even our neighbors to the north - Canadians - don't have this same cultural trait where they need to dance around the issues. In fact, it seems to me that Canadians by and large are completely blind to derision - at least when it is expressed in behavior... they just can't see it - because it's not a part of their own culture. The word they use to refer to the topic is ""self-consciousness"" - therefore we see that they attribute a trait to the person who feels slighted, rather than to the person who was doing the slighting.

I insist that we Americans can become a much more humane, friendly, and sensible society if we stop being so full of social drama. We need cooler heads... and that includes making sure we don't blow up at someone who was using words in what we consider to be a slightly politically incorrect way.

You're right, my country isn't very sensitive. Which seriously hurts German people of color. There are theaters using blackface, zoos exhibiting ""African culture"", people thinking they have the right to use the n-word. We desperately need open discussion about this. As many problems with racism you may have in the US, at least people usually know it's not acceptable to wear blackface!

(At this point people usually say that we ""don't have that many people of color in Germany"", so it's not as much of a cultural clash. Or that we don't have a history of slavery. I'll just address this briefly since I'm not in the mood for a history lesson at 4AM: Colonialism was a thing. And it casts its shadows far into our times. People of color were forced to die in our wars, we killed them, and we neglect to teach the atrocities to our kids. I guess there's limited time and a lot of crimes Germany committed, but I don't even remember learning about the colonies in school. Which may vary from school to school, I'm aware of that. But I know Germans who seriously think Germany didn't have colonies! And there are many German people of color, the first arrived when the US didn't even exist yet. Or, well, Germany.
And this here is exactly the thing: People of color are *not considered German*. They're frequently asked when they're going back ""home"", or where they're from, no, ORIGINALLY.)

If you speak German, I highly recommend Noah Sow's ""Deutschland Schwarz Weiß - Der alltägliche Rassismus"", or [this website](http://blog.derbraunemob.info/) which keeps track of racism in Germany and also offers information. 

It's not that everyone is okay with Germany's insensitivity. It's just that minorities don't get heard, and instead we only hear the voice of the majority. It's not a non-issue, and it's not just drama.

Yes! As an exchange student in West Berlin in the late 1980s, it was really off-putting for me to see how Turkish people were referred to at the dinner parties held by my middle-class German host family. 

History is important to learn, as you point out.

&gt; People of color are not considered German. They're frequently asked when they're going back ""home"", or where they're from, no, ORIGINALLY.

That is the core of the problem, as I see it! The question is one I would rather awkwardly refer to as: ""Where is the 'we'?"" I think that the root of much of the evil in the world has to do with a ""limited sense of the 'we'."" 

We see this playing out in Egypt right now. That country, under Mubarak, did not have a chance to develop a sense of civic pride and ownership of their national institutions. They didn't develop a sense of national identity. Instead, people feel loyal to their various factions. Now, everybody wants their particular faction to have hegemony over guiding the country's direction, as a whole. The sense of ""us and them"" there, is not guided by ethnic differences, but rather by a person's loyalty to a religion or to an organization.

Here in the USA, my fellow Americans get very hateful when talking about those whom they consider to be a threat ""to the us."" Over the decades, this other group has been homosexuals, blacks, communists, muslims, those who commit crime, and many other groups.

To return to the topic of Germany - you are right - in Germany, as you point out (and in many other countries) - people lean toward defining their country in terms of a single ethnicity. I think this is a great social tragedy, being that I'm someone who has grown up and lived in a multicultural society - which sees itself as a ""melting pot"" of folks who have immigrated from all over the world. 

The ironic thing, however, is that I think it's not even accurate to believe that people with different ethnic backgrounds or skin colors have different values because of the group which they are a member of. A person's actions and values are defined by their worldview. A person will act within the world that he or she sees to be around him. That worldview in modern industrial countries is molded by the universal education system - and by the sort of discourse with which journalists discuss the issues of importance to the nation. Therefore, I would argue that a black person in Germany is more German than he is black... and the same thing would be true in other countries. I see that the real differences in personality occur when you cross an international border. When you change languages that gives a people even more opportunity to develop differences in their worldview and their value systems.

Growing up, it was uncommon to sleep through the night without being awoken by gunshots. In my city alone we had more murders than some European countries. We also had more murders than total soldiers killed in the middle east for that year.

true,sinston_wmith,MPyrenees,Midi-Pyrénées,"From a more economic point of view, the current system (as good as it can work) is not currently substainable and is slowly changing.

Public healthcare is under national management (handled by the state authority), as opposed for example to high school education (handled by provinces, see the various laws over the last 30 years about decentralization which delegated more and more concerns to the regions, I'm shortening a lot).

Healthcare is payed through various taxes on both workers and companies called obligatory charges. This include taxes for the unemployed (increasing since 30 years), the retired (increasing due to 50's baby boom), public healthcare, etc. Those taxes have never compensated in totality the expenses, meaning the state has to borrows money to handle it, contributing to the country debt.

From 2000 to 2013, the deficit for healthcare (health branche of the social security) has gone through various evolutions : -1.6bn € in 2000 to -11.6bn in 2004. In 2005, a law passed which instaured a fixed fee of 1€ paid by the patient for every medical consultations to a generalist doctor (which you also have to declare, this is the ""médecin traitant""). He is now also the only one to be able to send you to a specialized doctor (radiology, etc. to the exception of some, like gynecologist). If you decide to see a specialized doctor on your own, you will have to pay 70% instead of the usual 30%). With a reinforced control of frauds, deficit went down to -8bn in 2005, but was back to -11.6bn in 2011, mostly due to unemployment rising with the global financial crisis. Deficit is again going down back to -5.5bn in 2013, with an expected return to equity in 2015. This is mostly due to a strong increase in taxes.

The aforementioned taxes are payed by the workers and the employers and are divided in various parts. Revenues are for 2010 : 

* CSG (workers) : from 1.1% of the salary in 1990 to 7.5% in 1998. Far higher on what's called the ""capital revenue"" (= interests, stocks, etc.). It will possibily rise in 2013 in order to compensate the increased expense for the retired. 83bn.
* Tobacco taxes : Rising since i can't even remember. Account for 12bn.
* CRDS (workers) : reimbursement of the social security debt (yes, this is a little fact not often spoke about). Fixed 0.5%. I was created in 1996 for 13 years but was prolonged to 2014. 6bn.
* Taxe on salaries (employers). Based on the amount of the salary, so extremely complicated to say. But can range from 15% of the salary for a SMIC worker (minimum legal wage) to 45%.

As you can see, healthcare in France is not exactly free. One more reason : when you get to see a doctor, you are automatically reimbursed of 70% of the common amount (23€ in most cases). The other 30% are on your own if you have not subscribed to a private complementary assurance. These are often provided through your employers and are sometimes free, sometimes not. I'd say otherwise the most basic amount is around 35€/month for a young worker in a good shape. This can go way up if you have ocular, ear or other specific problems which involve additional costs.

Public healthcare in France is a great thing from a people point of view (as stated in the other answers) but a real nightmare from a accountant one. The famous social debt (healthcare + retired + family aid + work accidents) is of 142bn in 2011 (10.5% of the GDP), now decreasing due to the consecutive reforms. Obligatory taxes are 44% of the GDP in 2005 (USA : 27.3%, Germany : 34.8%, UK : 36.5%, Sweden : 50%, OCDE : 36%, UE15 : 40%).


**TL;DR : Healthcare system in France is not free and economically deficient due to it being entirely based on the economic situation of the country** ^(^which ^is ^not ^exactly ^the ^greatest ^of ^all ^times ^at ^the ^moment).

&gt; Se ti iscrivi all'AIRE devi non avere interessi in Italia.

L'iscrizione all'AIRE è un obbligo se di fatto risiedi all'estero ma non succede nulla se non lo fai (secondo un'impiegata AIRE mio comune). A parte il discorso sanità (iscritti all'AIRE pagano 100%?) l'iscrizione serve a comunicare allo Stato lo stato delle cose (ovvero residente all'estero), non ci sono prerequisiti se non il risiedere all'estero. Puoi avere interessi in Italia (ad esempio rendite finanziarie, sulle quali sì devi pagare le tasse).

I worked in IT in Milan for a large company and I remember working with a Russian intern who didn't speak a word of Italian, and I think he did get more than 300€/month. Of course this is only likely to happen in larger companies with younger people.

As for day-to-day living learning Italian is probably necessary, but you can make do with gestures and grunts for a while.

With a MD in demand an entry level position would give you about 1200-1300€/month, after taxes (but keep in mind that due to strange traditions you basically get paid 13 times a year, and roughly another month's worth per year is set aside for when you leave). As far as I know the only thing really in demand right now is IT stuff, but finance might not be bad in Milan. The only way to find out is to start sending your CV around and see what happens.

&gt;During the first three decades of communist rule, agricultural planners ordered the slaughter of thousands of workhorses, which were to be replaced by more powerful tractors. Indeed, the number of tractors available to agriculture grew from 13,700 in 1950 to 168,000 in 1983. But with the onset of the energy crisis, the regime reversed its policy. A program adopted by the National Council for Agriculture, Food Industry, Forestry, and Water Management in 1986 called for increasing horse inventories by 90,000 head by the end of the decade and reducing the number of tractors in service by nearly one-third. By 1990, according to plans, horse-drawn equipment would perform 18 to 25 percent of all harvesting and virtually all hauling on livestock farms.

The 80's really sucked in Romania. Economic crisis in the whole Eastern Bloc combined with Ceaușescu's ambition to pay all of Romania's debts, and in the same time starting megalomaniac projects like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Parliament).

The early decades of communism were not all bad. Sure, there was much harm done - political persecution affected many people and destroyed much of the country's intellectual elite. But in some ways the country moved forward: illiteracy dropped from the worst in Europe to almost 0 in a decade, agricultural yield increased significantly (see document linked above), a lot of large industry was developed, [not all of it bad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_Dacia).",0,1376810976,null,0,false,0,cbq4u35,t3_1kka7f,t1_cbq4u35,t1_cbpvlgp,null,1429788833,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,trugoyo,null,null,"&gt; Al paese dove vivi non gliene frega niente di come tu sia messo con l'Italia, almeno dove vivo io lavori lì vivi lì = le tasse locali le paghi.

Il paese dove vivi ovviamente non ha interesse del tuo rapporto con l'Italia... ma il nostro problema è appunto l'Italia. Conosco decine di stranieri che vivono in paesi stranieri e nessuno ha i dilemmi dell'italiano all'estero. Alcune nazioni hanno il principio della residenza altre del luogo dove lavori. Cioé per alcuni paghi le tasse dove risiedi, per altri dove lavori. Normalmente se lavori in un posto paghi le tasse lì... è ovvio. Quello che non è chiaro a moltissimi italiani è che se NON tolgono la residenza italiana... per l'Italia bisogna integrare le tasse pagate all'estero con quelle italiane. E in molti casi l'Agenzia delle Entrate parte dal presupposto che sei un evasore. Bada bene, non sono un esperto, ma solo uno che vuole fare le cose per bene e si è reso conto che è praticamente impossibile. 

&gt; L'iscrizione all'AIRE è un obbligo se di fatto risiedi all'estero ma non succede nulla se non lo fai (secondo un'impiegata AIRE mio comune). A parte il discorso sanità (iscritti all'AIRE pagano 100%?) l'iscrizione serve a comunicare allo Stato lo stato delle cose (ovvero residente all'estero), non ci sono prerequisiti se non il risiedere all'estero. Puoi avere interessi in Italia (ad esempio rendite finanziarie, sulle quali sì devi pagare le tasse).

Allora, da quello che ho capito (ripeto - non sono un esperto e potrei avere capito baggianate, dato che due funzionari dicono due cose diverse) l'iscrizione AIRE ai fini fiscali non è nemmeno più l'unica cosa che devi fare per pagare le tasse solo all'estero. Nel senso che qualche anno fa bastava quello, adesso non è più l'unico elemento. Ovviamente l'iscrizione all'AIRE è compatibile con molte cose, ma sempre se poi paghi le tasse anche in Italia. La situazione di cui parlo io è quella in cui vuoi - come cittadino che non vive più in Italia - non pagare più le tasse italiane. Se hai delle rendite in italia ma provi a pagare le tasse solo all'estero potresti trovarti (in qualsiasi momento, anche in anni a venire) nella situazione in cui ti vengano contestate le tue dichiarazioni dei redditi e che tu debba compensare le tasse che hai pagato all'estero (se si paga meno) con l'aliquota italiana. Ti faccio esempio: vivi in un posto dove si paga il 10% di tasse? In Italia fai conto che è il 50? Paghi 10 all'estero e 40 in Italia. Bella situazione, soprattutto se vivi in un posto con un costo della vita media più basso (e stipendi più bassi) proprio perché hanno tasse più basse.

Pensa che l'iscrizione all'aire può essere anche automatica. Non ho ancora capito come, ma se si accorgono che risiedi all'estero potrebbero iscriverti loro, d'ufficio.

&gt; Ti bloccano i bonifici?

No ma potresti sembrare un italiano che cerca di spostare liquidità all'estero per evitare di pagarci in futuro tasse - o magari un italiano che ha un'attività in nero all'estero. La regola base è che per l'Agenzia delle Entrate - praticamente - sei un criminale.... perché stai spostando soldi all'estero se sei residente in Italia?

Die kleine Gruppe wird von oben fotografiert und gefilmt. Dann dreht der Hubschrauber wieder ab. 

Naja weisste. ""Fast"" zehn Minuten. Und das ist wahrscheinlich auch noch übertrieben, da der Artikel ja anscheinend nicht unbedingt objektiv geschrieben ist. Hat wahrscheinlich eine Runde gedreht und ist wieder weg. Vielleicht war der Hubschrauber nichtmal an sie gerichtet.

Ich würde ja nichts gegen Demonstrationen in dem Sinne haben, wenn sie auch offiziell und damit wirkungsvoll wäre.

There are many things unusual with this oath.

E sono basita che ""uomo uccide compagna a bottigliate"" sia visto non come omicidio di genere. La compagna dovrebbe essere qualcuno di cui è innamorato, e uno la ammazza a bottigliate. Per logica, se uno ha l'impulso di ammazzare a bottigliate qualcuno non dovrebbe essere la compagna di vita, o no? Eppure questo accade molto più spesso del contrario, numeri in mano.

Per questo mi sfugge tutta sta drammaticità sul ""nessuno che pensa agli uomini!!"".

Genau, den Griechen geht's viel schlechter. Und die dürfen aber auch nichts verbessern, weil sie's immer noch besser haben als die Vietnamesen. Und die Vietnamesen sollen aber schön die Füße stillhalten, bis die Nordkoreaner mal in die Puschen kommen. Daraus wird aber nix solange Somalia nicht klarkommt.

&gt; 
&gt; One was sent to the Cabinet Office for two years, while another worked in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for 14 months.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the Sunday Times, some of the ministers working in these departments did not know about the appointments.

I am so sick of seeing this completely false and degrading meme repeated. No, southern Europeans do not work less than northern Europeans--they work more. Source: http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=ANHRS

Not only that, southern Europeans tend to be paid less, have less workers' rights, and face stiffer competition in the labor market (thanks to high unemployment) than northern Europeans.

You want the dolce vita? Go to Norway, where disposable income averages are about $9000 per year higher than in Italy (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage).

So why aren't the Norwegians famous for sipping lattes and enjoying the sunset? Partly because of the weather (and in that case, why not envy the Filipinos for the easy lifestyle? Yeah...). Partly it's because of cultural stereotypes (then why not envy the Negroes for being so lazy? Yeah...). And partly it's because northern Europeans are implicitly, maybe subconsciously, in an economic war with southern Europeans, and to win that war they keep stating how lazy, incompetent, inefficient, yet romantic and quaint their southern brethren are even if it goes 100% completely counter to the facts.

The hydrogen bomb was arguably the most significant experimental scientific achievement till today. Just to make this clear, I am not willing to argue about if for hours and weigh it up against incomparable things like space travel, genetics or other projects like CERN, which will the long term definitely prove more important.

When ""Ivy Mike"" was detonated, humanity went to the very limits of the amounts of energy that can be freed up on this planet even by our understanding 60 years later. They made a little sun on the surface of earth.

Teller was aware of its scientific significance, but he went public declaring he wants to build it to kill all the Russians. Now, he said it because he needed the support of American politicians, but he was still the one who said it and he maintained this little story up until the end.

Teller was, like Oppenheimer for the fission bomb, the project lead, it was his passion that made the project possible and kept it going, but most key developments came from other people: Ulam, von Neumann, Fuchs to name the most important. If Teller would have been allowed to write history books, the name ""Ulam"" would not be mentioned once. With most other guys he succeeded to rob them of their recognition of their work, to some extent.

Can you show me where Oppenheimer declared *he* developed the fission bomb, because it's just how awesome he is, and hundreds of scientists like Enrico Fermi were just standing around with their hands in their pockets? No? I thought so!

One point which is worth mentioning, is that a non-profit semi-gouvernmental agency sets ALL the 'acceptable' prices for basically all types of treatment you can imagine. They do this based upon the retail cost of the treatment and also give the doctor a nice cut for his salary. This means the prices that you pay, the prices that the system them 'reimburses', are MASSIVELY lower than the insanely inflated prices in countries like the USA. If a doctor wishes to charge more than this amount, they can, but their patient will only ever be reimbursed up to the 'guideline acceptable amount' (prix conventionel). This encourages doctors not to overcharge and attract more patients. 

A lot of procedures are a 'flat rate' price, so like, when my friend cut his hand open with a pearing knife and had 3 visits to the ER and multiple dressings, it cost the same as another friend who had to have 1 stitch on his forehead when he stood up underneath a cupboard door (I have clumsy friends). The guy who only had 1 stitch obviously was paying a bit more than what his procedure cost, but the guy who had 3 trips to the ER and multiple dressings and stitches could then pay a bit less, and it all evens out at the end. 

Final point is, doctors, nurses and ancilliary medical staff are paid A LOT less than in the USA. Doctors aren't millionaires here. They just live comfortable upper-middle-class lives, nurses live comfortable middle-class lives, and everyone is pretty much OK with that, because it means that A N Other in the street isn't going to be screwed and made bankrupt if he is hit by a car.

Mal ein bisschen [Google-Fu](http://www.str2.jura.uni-erlangen.de/lehre/WS200405/Materialien/BT/201_ff.pdf) anwenden. Außerdem dürfte es recht interessant sein, [das hier](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bildrechte#Luftaufnahmen_und_milit.C3.A4rische_Einrichtungen) mit [dem hier (erster Satz)](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_Complex) zu vergleichen. Siehste was? Ist mindestens Grauzone wo der junge Herr sich aufhält.

&gt;Er hat insofern was damit zu tun als daß wir nicht wissen dürfen, was da passiert. Alle interessanten Daten und Fakten der Geheimdienste unterliegen der Geheimhaltung. Wie soll ich mich denn demokratisch beteiligen, wenn ich dummgehalten werd?

Nun es gibt nun mal öffentlich zugängliche Daten und welche die es nicht sind, da sie, wenn sie in die falschen Hände geraten gefährlich sind. Ich muss dir ja wohl nicht erklären dass Geheimdienste geheime Sachen machen, meistens in erster Linie um das Wohlergehen der Bürger sicherzustellen. Wenn du damit nicht übereinstimmst, ist das so eine Sache. Aber ich vertraue dem Staat hinsichtlich dieses Themas noch genug.

&gt;Meinst Du die kompetente Arbeit auf Demonstrationen wie bei G8 in Heiligendamm, S21 in Stuttgart, Occupy in Frankfurt und Freiheit statt Angst in Berlin? Oder solche alltäglichen Fälle wie...

Es gibt weitaus weniger Fälle von polizeilicher Inkompetenz in den Medien als Erfolge. Das ist nun mal das Kreuz was die Hüter des Rechts tragen müssen. So weit ich es sehen kann versinkt hier niemand in Anarchie, Straftaten auf offener Straße halten sich in Grenzen und einzele Fälle von Missverständnissen, Unwissen oder einzelnen Arschlöchern in der Polizei, die es sonst überall auch gibt, sind da irrelevant meiner Meinung nach. Besser als in den Staaten wo regelmäßig Haustiere abgeknallt werden, mit Pfefferspray um sich geworfen wird und Demonstranten Tazer abbekommen. Wer sich hier bei öffentlichen Demonstrationen nicht benehmen kann und Polizisten mit Steinen abwirft und beleidigt, soll halt auf die Nase bekommen. Alle sollten sich an die Spielregeln halten. Und jetzt komm hier bitte nicht wieder damit dass internationale Vergleiche nicht zählen. Ist immerhin ein direkter Vergleich über die Qualität von Polizisten in zwei relativ ähnlichen Ländern.

&gt;Genau, den Griechen geht's viel schlechter. Und die dürfen aber auch nichts verbessern, weil sie's immer noch besser haben als die Vietnamesen. Und die Vietnamesen sollen aber schön die Füße stillhalten, bis die Nordkoreaner mal in die Puschen kommen. Daraus wird aber nix solange Somalia nicht klarkommt. Hach, ist das praktisch, wenn's anderen schlechter geht.

Klar hat jedes Land seine eigenen Probleme die auf einer Skala im direkten Vergleich schlimmer oder unsinniger erscheinen können. Ein Land das von Hungersnot geplagt ist hat es natürlich schlimmer als eins wo absolut wertlose e-mails von unwichtigen Leuten gespeichert werden. Aber das ist halt der Sinn von meinem Vergleich. Leute suchen sich immer irgendwelche Probleme mit denen sie nicht zufrieden sind und machen aus jeder Mücke einen Elefanten. So ein Drama war das was am Dagger Komplex jetzt geschehen ist auch nicht und relevant zur ganzen NSA/Überwachungsdebatte schon garnicht. Sag es mir doch, hat es irgendwas gebracht? Wirklich irgendetwas? Hat er Snowden oder Assange oder ""der Freiheit"" irgendeinen Dienst erwiesen? Ich glaube eher weniger. Ja, blabla er kämpft für seine Rechte.

I'm not sure what ""spend about half of the country's economy"" means. Do you mean government spending as % of gdp? Well, Sweden, Finland, France, and the UK have you beat. Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending#As_a_percentage_of_GDP . So that's not the problem.

&gt; when the public debt is larger than the actual GDP and when the interest rates on such public debt is greater than the growth of the economy,

This is a bit more complicated. Yes, Portugal's public debt as a percent of GDP (http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/government-debt-to-gdp) is one of the highest in the EU right now. But it was lower than France's in 2006 (http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/government-debt-to-gdp) and lower than Germany's in 2007 (http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/government-debt-to-gdp). Why is it skyrocketing now? That's a little complicated, but it basically comes down to this: the ECB isn't printing enough Euros to get Portugal out of its debt trap. That's also why the interest rate on public debt is skyrocketing, too.

&gt;it's quite impossible to continue what we were doing without foreign help.

You're really buying into the having cake and eating it too politics of the EU. When you need help, they're foreign. When they need help, you're their brothers. They see it the opposite. What a great way to exploit people against their own interests!

Plus, you don't really need the ""foreign help"" as you put it. I guess what you mean is cash bailouts to recapitalize Portuguese banks to pay off bondholders. What would this mean? Well, it'd mean German and French governments (through the ECB) giving you money that you'd in turn give to German and French banks. I'm not sure how this is ""foreign help"" as much as it is facilitating foreign creditor interests. Without the foreign help, you could just default and rebuild like Iceland has successfully done.

&gt; We were the ones who asked for help, why is it suddenly somebody else's fault?

Border conflict with Spain: London intensified conflict over Gibraltar

British Prime Minister David Cameron: maneuvers in the Mediterranean

In the dispute over Gibraltar nobody wants to give in: British Prime Minister David Cameron taking legal action against Spain to release the tightened border controls. And he sends warships to the coast of British enclave - the maneuver.

London - The British government is taking legal action against Spain and the bullying from their perspective customs controls at the border with Gibraltar . This would be without precedent in history, Downing Street announced.

The British enclave on the Mediterranean coast is outraged that the customs at the border recently searched every vehicle - and thus causing long traffic jams. Madrid justifies this by increasing cigarette smuggling and the fact that Gibraltar is not just for the Schengen area belong. In this area there is usually no personal checks at the borders.

Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, in turn, had announced measures for the defense of Spanish interests on Friday. But he stressed that it concerned only ""legal and appropriate measures"". Although he aspire an amicable solution with his British counterpart David Cameron on, but will still stick to the stricter border controls .

London assumed a political revenge maneuvers behind the harassment at the border. Gibraltar had previously let concrete blocks with metal spikes sink into Spanish waters, so as to create an artificial reef and to hinder the work of Spanish fishermen.

Great Britain is holding maneuvers

Amidst the tensions London sends warships to maneuver to the coast of its overseas territories. As the Ministry of Defence announced that is set to expire within a week and reach Gibraltar on Tuesday the frigate HMS ""Westminister"". Another three ships should leave British ports to the Mediterranean as early as Monday.

The Ministry spoke of a long-planned exercise routine. Minister for Europe David Lidington wrote in the daily newspaper ""The Sun"", the UK and Spain estimated today though. But this did not mean ""that we turn a blind eye when people are threatened or pressured in Gibraltar"". Spanish media evaluated the plan to restart the HMS ""Westminster"" Gibraltar, but as intimidating action.

Gibraltar belongs since 1713 to the United Kingdom. Spain does not recognize British sovereignty over the rocks and demanding the return of the 6.8-square-kilometer territory.

Sulla base delle indicazioni provenienti dalla Convenzione del Consiglio d’Europa, fatta ad Istanbul l’11 maggio 2011, concernente la lotta contro la violenza contro le donne e in ambito domestico di Istanbul, recentemente ratificata dal Parlamento, il decreto mira a rendere più incisivi gli strumenti della repressione penale dei fenomeni di maltrattamenti in famiglia, violenza sessuale e di atti persecutori (stalking).

Vengono quindi inasprite le pene quando:

* il delitto di maltrattamenti in famiglia è perpetrato in presenza di minore degli anni diciotto;
* il delitto di violenza sessuale è consumato ai danni di donne in stato di gravidanza;
*  il fatto è consumato ai danni del coniuge, anche divorziato o separato, o dal partner.

Un secondo gruppo di interventi riguarda il delitto di stalking:

*  viene ampliato il raggio d’azione delle situazioni aggravanti che vengono estese anche ai fatti commessi dal coniuge pure in costanza del vincolo matrimoniale, nonché a quelli perpetrati da chiunque con strumenti informatici o telematici;
*  viene prevista - analogamente a quanto già accade per i delitti di violenza sessuale - l’irrevocabilità della querela per il delitto di atti persecutori, che viene, inoltre, incluso tra quelli ad arresto obbligatorio.

Sono previste poi una serie di norme riguardanti i maltrattamenti in famiglia:

* viene assicurata una costante informazione alle parti offese in ordine allo svolgimento dei relativi procedimenti penali;
*  viene estesa la possibilità di acquisire testimonianze con modalità protette allorquando la vittima sia una persona minorenne o maggiorenne che versa in uno stato di particolare vulnerabilità;
*  viene esteso ai delitti di maltrattamenti contro famigliari e conviventi il ventaglio delle ipotesi di arresto in flagranza;
*  si prevede che in presenza di gravi indizi di colpevolezza di violenza sulle persone o minaccia grave e di serio pericolo di reiterazione di tali condotte con gravi rischi per le persone, il Pubblico Ministero – su informazione della polizia giudiziaria - può richiedere al Giudice di irrogare un provvedimento inibitorio urgente, vietando all’indiziato la presenza nella casa familiare e di avvicinarsi ai luoghi abitualmente frequentati dalla persona offesa.

Infine, è stabilito che i reati di maltrattamenti ai danni di familiari o conviventi e di stalking sono inseriti tra i delitti per i quali la vittima è ammessa al gratuito patrocinio anche in deroga ai limiti di reddito. Ciò al fine di dare, su questo punto, compiuta attuazione alla Convenzione di Istanbul, recentemente ratificata, che impegna gli Stati firmatari a garantire alle vittime della violenza domestica il diritto all’assistenza legale gratuita.

Sempre in attuazione della Convenzione di Istanbul, si prevede il rilascio di un permesso di soggiorno per motivi di protezione (Tutela vittime straniere di violenza domestica, concessione del permesso di soggiorno per motivi umanitari come già previsto dall’articolo 18 del TU per le vittime di tratta);

Infine, a completare il pacchetto, si è provveduto a varare un nuovo piano straordinario di protezione delle vittime di violenza sessuale e di genere che prevede azioni di intervento multidisciplinari, a carattere trasversale, per prevenire il fenomeno, potenziare i centri antiviolenza e i servizi di assistenza, formare gli operatori;

Sweden, in terms of the society's opinions and attitudes, seems to match my own very well. Love the high-tech society.

A working attitude that puts high importance on work-life balance, overall punctuality (any culture that considers being late rude earns plus points from me), an inclination towards practicality (I mean like having non-flashy fashion and the like).

This. The key reasoning here is that our economies are less productive, so on average we actually have to work _more_ to earn the same or even less money than the equivalent average northern citizen. For many people who has huge mortgages there is not a choice, the only way to not get evicted is to keep working lots of hours.

The idea that the root problems of the south is laziness that can be solved just by forcing them to work harder is stupid. Yes, in theory forcing people to work more hours for the same wage will improve productivity. But people are already working lots of hours, and if they are forced to work even harder, we will hit socially/humanly acceptable limits. There is not a low hanging fruit there.

Dal 2004 l’EURES si avvale della collaborazione con l’ANSA, attraverso la consultazione dell’archivio DEA. Inoltre, grazie al supporto delle informazioni analitiche fornite dal Dipartimento della Pubblica Sicurezza del Ministero dell'Interno, il Rapporto è ormai accreditato come punto di riferimento statistico e analitico sia nel panorama dell'informazione sia in ambito scientifico e accademico.  

Direi che è una fonte sufficentemente accreditata.  

Inoltre, in Italia non sono inasprite le pene per l'omicidio di una donna. Magari leggere il decreto legge sarebbe una buona idea, dove non è mai menzionato uomo-donna ma sempre coniuge, convivente, partner o ""in famiglia"". Se ancora non è chiaro, significa che le pene sono inasprite per tutti, ma dato che pensa te, capita più spesso che sia la donna a farne le spese, viene menzionato il decreto principalmente in quest'ottica.

Germany. After learning it, its language is and is likely to remain among the most powerful ones out there.

Also, Russia works very differently and adapting to life there would be a much bigger ordeal than in any EU country.

I guess it would be either Norway, Poland, Russia or Skåne(Gotta resettle the lost land ;)).

Norway, because it's just like Denmark with more mountains and less fields. 

Poland, because unexplainable slavophile reasons, and because I like being there. 

Russia, the same unexplainable slavophile reasons(It can be summed up by history and language). Though it would most likely be Saint Petersburg or Moscow.",0,1376840053,null,0,false,0,cbq9c1f,t3_1klsfs,t1_cbq9c1f,t3_1klsfs,null,1429786661,24,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,24

It also never had any wealthy colonies to enrich it and fund the industrial revolution. I personally think thats the reason why Germany is so succesful. They had to compete with countries like France,the UK, Netherlands and Belgium that were getting rich of their empires.
