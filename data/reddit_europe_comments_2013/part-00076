Oftentimes foreign people work there and there are quizzes (not sure if you have that to in Ireland). It's - like you said - very social and another reason they exist isof course because it's more interesting to have a foreign looking place than something you already know. 

Live music is not that popular I guess, at least not as popular as I imagine it to be in Ireland.

The Spiegel article has been thoroughly debunked for reasons completely different than the ones you cited. [Read more here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ckpm5/germans_are_right_to_be_upset_over_the_poverty/). The public sector is the usual scapegoat for everything that is wrong with Greek society. What you say about inefficient or lazy employees is correct in some cases but not in the general case. Clientelism is indeed an issue. 

&gt; there are still some people, that take huge income and do nothing. These are the people that the article talks about, and i think we all agree,these people must have their income slashed.

That makes zero sense. If it was only a few of them, then they could not push the average household wealth upwards. Unless they are paid millions or something. 

&gt; Also,from my point of view, soon things will start getting better. Many people have started to realise, that we cannot ask bigger salaries than europe or even the same, as we mistakenly did, if we dont have better products,etc.

The whole lived above their means parable, yes. Enough with the self-hate. [Watch this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=HpIsZL5FJVs#t=0s), you need to understand that there is more to the crisis than profligacy.

&gt; I have heard, some OGA subventions are started to be given, like the 90s. They give subventions to those who plant tabac, in Agrinio. I truly wish, more and more subventions to be given, in order we start finally living our own without imports and even start exports like 90s.

Greece based a lot of its competitiveness on currency devaluation and lost that benefit along with much of its production base when it joined the eurozone. To regain competitiveness now you must compete head to head with countries like Germany or keep reducing your standard of living. Subsidies require money or EU funds, I have not heard anything about new farming subsidies. 

&gt; Also, after the last months, we see that eurozone is not gonna be split. Germany invited us in ~2000, so as to, have a strong currency and can fight $ and YEN and what we see today is a over-inflated dollar and YEN while euro is still the same.Back in 2000, only 1 country theoritically could be in eurozone, and deliberately they let so many countries join Eurozone for this reason.

There is no singular reason for why the eurozone was created. The lecture I linked to above suggests that Germans viewed it as a way to deprive other countries of the possibility of currency devaluation, the French viewed it as a necessary step towards political unification and the Southerners thought it would allow them to do away with rampant inflation. The reality is likely to be even more complicated. ",1,1366336205,null,0,false,0,c9i5vtw,t3_1cljga,t1_c9i5vtw,t1_c9hvc3s,null,1431506336,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Longer one: In your argumentation you seem to think that governmental spending can only be incremental, i.e. ""If I institute a new expenditure (school lunches) I have to insititue a new tax to pay for it."" What quires and jrohila are trying to tell you is that the Greeks could cut spending somewhere else to free already earned money. Why does Greece need such an overblown military? It would be easy to cut spending there. The administrative apparatus, bureaucracy, could be slashed as well.

Et comme par hasard, 20 minutes avant le retrait pour décider de continuer ou non la séance après 1h, ils descendent tous comme s'ils allaient péter la gueule au camp opposé. Je suis vraiment déçu qu'on ait pas les images, dire que l'enregistrement s'arrête aux interruptions de séance est une connerie, bientôt on nous dira que c'était pour changer la cassette peut-être..                 
Pendant la pause de l'interruption de séance, une partie des personnes se sont regroupés pour choisir l'histoire qu'on allait dire, pendant que d'autres étaient interviewés, parlant de coups qui sont partis, qui auraient touchés les huissiers.. Une députée UMP interrogée a dit quelque-chose du genre ""ah non, je n'ai rien vu, il n'y a pas eu de coups, bien que ma vision ait put être bloquée par quelqu'un d'autre, même si je ne pense pas que ce soit possible"" et après une autre interruption, plus aucune mention de coups ou quoi que ce soit, je crois que ça a été étouffé, et comme par hasard on ne verra jamais la vidéo de ce qu'il s'est réellement passé..                
Bref, la séance reprends vers 1h30, chacun a la parole pour parler de ce qu'il s'est passé, le président de l'assemblé condamne la violence et le comportement venant de se produire, la gauche également, et l'UMP en profite pour dire que c'est parce qu'ils sont fatigués, qu'il serait mieux de reporter la séance, que c'est parce que la gauche veux prévoir son weekend, ... et personne ne s'est excusé du comportement (je ne parle pas de coups puisqu'il n'y a pas de preuve publiques, il n'y a pas besoin d'excuses, mais au moins de l'attitude de tout un partie politique qui dévale les marches comme une bande de gamins comme s'ils allaient péter la gueule au camp opposé..)
Le président dit que reporter la séance au lendemain, ce serait récompenser ce genre de comportement, et que la séance continuera, ce à quoi la droite s'offusque, en disant que cela n'est pas à lui de décider et que c'est à décider par vote. vote rapide, en faveur de la continuation de la séance.                   
Et surtout, ce qui m'a énervé, c'est que toute la nuit l'opposition a passé des heures à dire, un par un, que les heures après 1h coutent très cher, et demandant des comptes pour savoir combien cela coute, répétant un par un la même chose, les heures après 1h coutent cher, ... (très logique de faire perdre 2h après 1h du mat simplement pour répéter en boucle que ça coute très cher..)                
                
Bref, ce qui m'énerve le plus c'est qu'on ne saura jamais vraiment ce qu'il s'est passé cette nuit, vu en direct ça ressemblait sacrément a une tentative de cacher le pire (le débordement, peut-être les coups). C'est compréhensible, vu l'opinion publique sur le gouvernement, et le début du débordement qu'ils ne pouvaient plus cacher, de vouloir éviter que le peuple s’aperçoive réellement d’à quel point on est gouverné par des sauvages qui ressemblent plus à des collégiens qui ne savent pas se  tenir.

l'Italia è in crisi ""nella crisi"" perché ha un problema storico di incapacità a controllare il potere criminale. In Italia i poteri legali, quelli che sono espressione dei cittadini e del patto sancito dalla Costituzione, sono incapaci di controllare l'influenza del crimine organizzato e della corruzione sulla vita pubblica.

Dal '94 si contrabbanda l'idea che la lotta al crimine ed alla sua espressione nella vita pubblica sia in realtà lotta politica tra una destra salvifica ed una sinistra veterocomunista, e che la magistratura sia espressione di tale lotta.

Io invece ritengo che la presenza nella vita politica di un blocco di interessi criminale e corrotto sia un'emergenza da terminare, e non con alcun tipo di negoziato, ma con un'opposizione senza compromessi.

E giusto per non ricadere nel giochino che io dico questo per delegittimare chi policamente la pensa in maniera diversa da me, preciso che a mio modo di vedere lo schieramento dell'illegalità è assolutamente trasversale - ma con un nucleo che, come il nucleo originario di un cancro, va eradicato.

Si e' fatto sbeffeggiare da Monti, che ha preso a attaccarlo come un botolo ringhioso, malgrado il sostegno dato al suo governo (e pagato - e caro - in consenso). Sarebbe dovuto veramente andare in TV e (fuoco col fuoco) dirgli in faccia, ma come puoi pensare di fare l'equidistante fra chi ti ha sostenuto e chi ti ha accoltellato alle spalle?

Ultimately  I'd say ""whatever works"". If the purpose of the EU is the wellbeing of its citizens, then right now it's failing miserably as far as the people of Greece, Spain or Ireland is concerned. So we need to move forwards or backwards. However it will take many years of negotiations, parliamentary debates, referenda etc to move forward and build the institutions we need. The shorter and easier fix - to get our economies working again - may be to move backward and dissolve the Euro and loosen the union. The electorates may want this anyway, given the distrust between North/South and East/West.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Like-minded when it gets to how a discussion should be lead, yes. We hope people will be conscious about being in a different subreddit, and adjust their commenting style accordingly, that is, ask themselves whether what they wrote passes the ""is it constructive?"" test before they hit send, avoid polemics, and so on.

We also ask people to choose the entry point to a discussion wisely. Rather than having high throughput of posts, we hope submitters will look at a variety of sources and choose one with background information and a neutral standpoint, even if this means they'll have to wait until a better one gets written if the news just broke. Think of it as an extension to the ""do not editorialize headlines"" rule -- the selection of articles is by itself an editorial act that can't be avoided, but users should present their arguments in the comment section instead of by submitting a link that is one sided.

While we're at the topic of influencing opinions through the selection of articles: The above, that we all have an inherent bias towards articles and opinions that reflect our personal views that we hope those like-minded individuals will attempt to compensate for in the common interest of quality discussions, there also is the issue of [agenda setting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda-setting_theory). It's something like a meta level to biased articles. Again, we all have our own biases and preferred topics, but there are people who are tempted to use large subreddits as a platform to draw attention to their cause. This may or may not be conscious or organized, and can be anywhere between well-meaning (check out /r/technology today and count CISPA posts) and crossing the border towards propaganda (at times we had an almost daily Roma or Muslim thread that provided fertile ground for often outright racist comments). It's been getting much better around here lately, and I assume the mods are hard at work to keep it that way, but it's an issue to be aware of none the less.

As for diversity of opinions, I'd say we already span a pretty wide spectrum even just between krattr and myself, and those ""poles"" are by no means boundaries. Of course the above limitations aren't clear cut, there is no easy and objective test to determine whether or not a submission is biased or even part of a campaign, moderators are biased themselves, and drama seems inevitable when self-regulation fails and they/we have to make a decision that, in the end, can only be subjective.  
I know Redditors rightfully feel strongly about Freedom of Expression, and any rule on submissions that restricts it reeks of censorship. However, public discourse is not restricted to a single subreddit. Freedom of Speech is a right to say what you want, not a right to be heard, especially not everywhere. The community rejects commercially motivated astro-turfing and social media campaigns. We extend this to politically motivated interest groups, because a) a small group or even a dedicated individual can easily set the tone of even mid-sized subreddits, especially if the frequency of submissions is low, and b), a plurality of forums is almost as important as the plurality of opinions itself. Otherwise we'd only replicated discussions that are already happening elsewhere and end up with an Internet-wide grey goo of opinions, or a bias towards the outer limits of the political spectrum that comes from the high level of motivation that partisans typically have.  

Another way to look at it is that we simply consider partisanship or campaigning to be off-topic for the subreddit. Or maybe think of it as another dimension to a plane that spans topics and opinions. Subreddits are a practically unlimited resource, so not every single one of them has to span over as wide a volume as possible. It's just another kind of diversity.

Serious discussions are the goal. Just quieter, with a focus on hearing, instead of the screaming matches that develop too easily when people are focused on getting heard. It's an ideal that almost certainly won't get fulfilled entirely, but in a smaller Subreddit it's worth aspiring to.",0,1366377318,null,0,1366378404,0,c9ifcos,t3_1clf6q,t1_c9ifcos,t1_c9ieftq,null,1431501803,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

1. At present the democratic deficit in Europe is massive. If we're going to integrate further then we need to see how this is going to be resolved.

3. The EU is corrupt as hell. Many Northern countries should not be looking to move to a more corrupt form of government than the one they have. It's insane.

4. For a lot of people to stomach the fiscal transfers needed to sort out the problems in the ""South"" is a bit much and as a result they'd probably want the South to cede more control over spending. 

5. The EU is far too inward looking and worrying over idiotic things such as CAP which should be left to nation states. Where we could benefit from a federal government e.g. defence it whimps out to keep the pacafist/neutral countries happy.

No. But it's a false dichotomy unless only a gay couple wants to adopt the child and nobody else. Adoptions are usually not allowed for single people either.

You mean two gay men or two lesbians? Not the same thing, gay (male) relationships are seldom monogamous and lasting.

I wouldn't have a problem with foster kids given to lesbian couples, I don't think it's worse than growing up with a single mother. Maybe some gay male couples are suited to that too. The problem is that if they are allowed that, they will immediately demand ""equal rights"" too, i.e. no ""discrimination"" against them when it's decided who can adopt a child.

For example, in countries where many people tend to live together (for cultural reasons or for lack of space or for extremely high real estate prices), the net wealth of households has less meaning.  
Imagine a country with an average of 3 people per household vs a country with an average of 1.5 people per household.

3. Last, household net wealth itself does not mean much.  
Imagine a country where half of the population are extremely rich business owners and their households are worth almost 0, because they simply live in high class hotels, rent paid by their own companies.

1. There will be an Association/Community of Serb majority municipalities in Kosovo. Membership will be open to any other municipality provided the members are in agreement.

2. The Community/Association will be created by statute. Its dissolution shall only take place by a decision of the participating municipalities. Legal guarantees will be provided by applicable law and constitutional law (including the 2/3 majority rule).

3. The structures of the Association/Community will be established on the same basis as the existing statute of the Association of Kosovo municipalities e.g. President, vice President, Assembly, Council.

4. In accordance with the competences given by the European Charter of Local Self Government and Kosovo law the participating municipalities shall be entitled to cooperate in exercising their powers through the Community/Association collectively. The Association/Community will have full overview of the areas of economic development, education, health, urban and rural planning.

5. The Association/Community will exercise other additional competences as may be delegated by the central authorities.

6. The Community/Association shall have a representative role to the central authorities and will have a seat in the communities’ consultative council for this purpose. In the pursuit of this role a monitoring function is envisaged.

7. There shall be one police force in Kosovo called the Kosovo Police. All police in northern Kosovo shall be integrated in the Kosovo Police framework. Salaries will be only from the KP.

8. Members of other Serbian security structures will be offered a place in equivalent Kosovo structures.

9. There shall be a Police Regional Commander for the four northern Serb majority municipalities (Northern Mitrovica, Zvecan, Zubin Potok and Leposavic). The Commander of this region shall be a Kosovo Serb nominated by the Ministry of Interior from a list provided by the four mayors on behalf of the Community/Association. The composition of the KP in the north will reflect the ethnic composition of the population of the four municipalities. (There will be another Regional Commander for the municipalities of Mitrovica South, Skenderaj and Vushtrri). The regional commander of the four northern municipalities will cooperate with other regional commanders.

10. The judicial authorities will be integrated and operate within the Kosovo legal framework. The Appellate Court in Pristina will establish a panel composed of a majority of K/S judges to deal with all Kosovo Serb majority municipalities.

11. A division of this Appellate Court, composed both by administrative staff and judges will sit permanently in northern Mitrovica (Mitrovica District Court). Each panel of the above division will be composed by a majority of K/S judges. Appropriate judges will sit dependant on the nature of the case involved.

12. Municipal elections shall be organized in the northern municipalities in 2013 with the facilitation of the OSCE in accordance with Kosovo law and international standards.

13. Discussions on Energy and Telecoms will be intensified by the two sides and completed by June 15.

14. It is agreed that neither side will block, or encourage others to block, the other side’s progress in their respective EU path.

15. An implementation committee will be established by the two sides, with the facilitation of the EU.",0,1366389330,null,0,1366396639,0,c9iieox,t3_1cog11,t1_c9iieox,t1_c9ihodc,null,1431500363,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

It already sort of exists in the form of the CAP.

The only thing that pouring money into troubled states will achieve is that they will stay as such.

In primo luogo quello che tu chiami cavillo è una questione di sostanza. Ti cito l'articolo rilevante:

&gt; Non sono eleggibili inoltre:

&gt; 1) coloro che in proprio o in qualità di rappresentanti legali di società o di imprese private risultino vincolati con lo Stato per contratti di opere o di somministrazioni, oppure per concessioni o autorizzazioni amministrative di notevole entità economica, che importino l'obbligo di adempimenti specifici, l'osservanza di norme generali o particolari protettive del pubblico interesse, alle quali la concessione o la autorizzazione è sottoposta; 

La norma (che è formulata in maniera piuttosto specifica), palesemente si applica a due categorie di soggetti: *""coloro che in proprio""* oppure *""in qualità di rappresentanti legali di società""* sono vincolati con lo Stato. Berlusconi non ricade nella prima nè nella seconda categoria. Questa norma non impedisce l'elezione alla camera di Berlusconi ma semmai di Confalonieri. 

Certo, si può sicuramente sostenere che *nella sostanza* la norma si dovrebbe applicare anche a Berlusconi (che non è legale rappresentante ma proprietario/azionista di maggioranza) visto che è in conflitto di interessi tanto quanto Confalonieri, ma si dovrebbe passare attraverso una interpretazione *analogica* di una norma che non si applica direttamente a Berlusconi. Insomma ci sarebbe da discutere.

In secondo luogo, (ed è questo il nocciolo della questione) l'ineleggibiltà di Berlusconi non avrebbe spostato la questione politica di un millimetro.

Sicuramente essere dichiarato ineleggibile gli avrebbe impedito di essere eletto al parlamento, ma non gli avrebbe impedito di fondare un partito, non gli avrebbe impedito di essere a capo di una coalizione, non gli avrebbe impedito di essere indicato quale presidente del consiglio dalla sua maggioranza, non gli avrebbe impedito di ricevere l'incarico di formare un governo, nè di formarlo. Insomma, non avrebbe cambiato niente.

&gt; Adesso ti chiedo io come si fa, in coscienza, nel 2013, a dire

La mia domanda rimane valida.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"Because few member states of the EU would be ok with the EU having its own army: The EU acts in the interests of its member states, so it needs a number of its states to say they want it first. Which leads to the other problem of cost, because if they support it, they're going to have to pay for it. Why would a member state or states want to pay for a European Army when they could very easily use their own army or simply rely on NATO.

It's also worth noting that a European Army shouldn't be in addition to national armies, it should be instead of. You can't have a European Army and then a French, British, Dutch national armies. Or at least you can't if all these armies have different foreign policy. If the British Army has one foreign policy and the European Army has another, you could end up with the British supporting (let's say) a Libyan government and the EU waging war against it. Basically what I mean, is that to have a European Army you need every one to agree on a foreign policy and that's really really hard.

The manner in which this trust is built is the knowledge that you and ‘he’ have a history of cooperation, and that your respective families likewise have a shared social and cultural history of cooperation, all of which allows you to trust that when adversity strikes ‘he’ will act in a predictable and acceptable way.

I simply do not recognise a sufficiently congruent set of aims and expectations to assent to being governed by the common will of the EU.

This does not mean that we should not strive towards harmonious cooperation and collaboration wherever a common viewpoint will bring a more effective outcome, but............

A nation is either:
1. a broadly sovereign state within the EU (as Britain has tried to become)
2. a functioning part of a larger sovereign entity (such as the converged euro-core will become)

This was done to allegedly prevent Gaddafi from spilling the beans about his ties with Sarkozy after being captured.

&gt;In late September 2012, reports erupted about the involvement of French secret services in the tracking and killing of Muammar Gaddafi. According to some sources, Gaddafi was in fact killed by a French spy who infiltrated the mob of rebels that captured Gaddafi, and shot him in the head after his capture. The motive for the operation was said to be to prevent Gaddafi from being interrogated and revealing his highly suspicious links with French President Nicolas Sarkozy. 

&gt;Former interim prime minister Mahmoud Jibril, told an Egyptian television that “it was a foreign agent who mixed with the revolutionary brigades to kill Qaddafi.”  Former NTC head of foreign intelligence Rami al-Obeidi confirmed Jibrils assertion, stating that ""French intelligence played a direct role in the death of Gaddafi, including his killing"" and claiming that Bashar al-Assad sold Gaddafi's satellite telephone number to French spies operating in Sirte in exchange for a ""grace period"" and less political pressure on the Syrian government by France.  Diplomatic sources in Tripoli stated that if a foreign agent was responsible for Gaddafi's death, it was certainly a French agent.

The Spanish live outdoors and as it will probably be summer when you are there and the weather will be amazing.  The bars and restaurants will have tables and chairs outside (though be warned - sometimes they charge you a euro or two per person to sit outside in Spain).  The streets will be crowded with shoppers and locals doing chores.  It's a wonderful place.

You'll want to see the main sites:  

-  Obviously the first thing you'll want to see is The Plaza Mayor, which is one of the most beautiful in Spain.  You'll want to walk through this as many times as possible during your time in Salamanca (it's great to see it from many different angles).  In the summer a lot of students sit on the ground and hang out or eat lunch.  It's really beautiful.

-  The Cathedral (the old and new are connected and can be seen at the same time).  This is a great cathedral, one of the best in Europe I've been to.  I recommend paying a few euros and walking to the top of it (on the side of the building) and getting a great view of all of Salamanca

-  Convento de San Esteban is VERY beautiful and not as commonly known/visited by tourists but I highly recommend it.  

-  The Roman Bridge is not extremely impressive but you can get a beautiful view of the cathedrals from down in that area.  Could be worth checking out

-  Go check out the painting ""Sky of Salamanca"" a beautiful mural painted by Fernando Gallego in the 1400's.  You can only see this during a few short hours and just few days a week (welcome to Spain) so most people don't get to see it.  But it's a pretty nice painting.  

And of COURSE you will want to eat as much Spanish food as possible.  As a student you may not have much of a budget but here is my list of the best places in Salamanca...I hope you will try as many as you can (at least grab some tapas):

**El Patio Chico** - This place has a great menu del dia with many choices and great tapas too.  It is filled with locals and tourists alike.  They have two locations.  The one a little further from the plaza is better in my opinion.  

**El Patio Cordobés** - This is off the beaten path a little bit but I love this place because their menu changes every day but the food is always really good.  The price is reasonable.  It's a local's kind of place.  

**La Posada** - This is more formal, and more expensive than most, but worth it in my opinion.  If you need a formal meal this is the place.

Tapas:

**Bambu** - Right next to the plaza.  Pretty damn good tapas.  Prices are ok.  Feel free to throw napkins on the floor in Salamanca, it's a compliment to the chef.  This place gets very crowded.  

**El Reloj** - In the plaza (which usually means it's tourist and expensive and thus better to avoid) but this place is damn good.  Get their huevos rotos and you will just about die.  

**calle van dyck** - Very hard to go wrong.  This will be your hub of tapas for your entire stay.  Walk around, try them all, enjoy!

**El Yunque** -  After a late night of drinking, go to this place and get an amazing sandwich.  

Enjoy Salamanca.  It's a really great place to spend a month.  I didn't even get into all of the places you can go to drink and the discos where you can go to party.  But that's going to be really, really easy for you to figure out.

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"&gt;This is one of the things the federalist do not want to answer.

Hi I'm a Federalist and I'll field this question.  The premise:

&gt;How should we create a USE if we take this long to implement a sort of constitution or if we need to constantly change treaties.

    American declaration of Independence:                         1776
    Articles of Confederation created:                            1777
    Articles of Confederation ratified:                           1781
    Constitution of the United States created:                    1787
    Constitution of the United States ratified:                   1788
    Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution created:     1789
    Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution ratified:    1791
    Amendments to the U.S. Constitution:                          1791-1992


These things take time.  I'm seeing arguments from anti-federalists here that there is no way the USE could ever come about because of the time it is taking to form a constitution or because treaties constantly require amendment.  These seem oddly placed given that a newly formed nation still took more than a decade to fully write up their constitution while the EU also spent slightly more than a decade to move from Maastricht to Lisbon (whether or not you want to consider that a constitutional equivalent is up to you).

Recently moreover there have been indications that the total numbers of Turkish forces on the island may have increased”

Yes we had inter-communal issues but the meddling of Turkey must stop and leave the island, both sides are civilised and we can work things out on our own. This is still invasion and occupation, the south remembers.

Edit: People shouldn't have downvoted your next comment, it's relevant, seeing as how many upvotes your first comment received.

Are you familiar with the project of European regions ? Have a look at [this map](http://imgur.com/0teGx9i) from the European Parliament.

I'm just going to analyze this from France's POV for a minute.

The European Commission is pushing to develop regional languages and promote regional autonomy.
You have to understand those are dialects that only an infinitesimal part of French are speaking. They are relics from hundreds of years ago.


Last week, there was a referendum about granting autonomy to a region in north eastern France.
Abstention was sky high, and the few who voted weren't in favor. This is to show you how this project is coming from the
top, not from the people.

The same is going to be done for other regions, amongst them Brittany. Who are the few pushing for an
independent Brittany ? Guys from the Breiz Atao Movement, created after WW1. Here's a quote from its founder's
memoires:
&gt;*""It's not because we think [Nazi] Germany will emerge victorious from the gigantic conflict, that we're at her side
since the first day of war. This is not an opportunistic choice, but a shared vision on essential points.
The situation is already clarified, as was Breiz Atao's policy. This policy was to seek German support,
which we sought with others, for more than twenty years.""* [Enough said ?](http://imgur.com/mxbtHdc)

At the same time, you have Catalonia claiming part of a southwestern region in France. Catalonia even has
a delegation representing  a Spanish province on France's territory demanding independance from the French so that it can be tied to Catalonia.

Here's the first Article of the French Constitution:*""France is an indivisible, secular, democratic and Social republic.""*
And here's the 5th article of the French Constitution: *""French is the language of the French Republic.""*

The European charter for regional languages was rejected by the Constitutional Council, as it would violate
those two articles.

Spain adopted in 2001 a charter that would promote 8 regional languages. Look at what's going now with Catalonia.
A referendum for seceding from Spain is planned for 2014. Scotland will have a similar one in 2014 as well.

Where did the president of the region of Catalonia go to seek political support ? THe US.
He even signed a partnership agreement with the state of Massachusetts.
Did you know Catalonia now has its own Ministry of Foreign Affairs ? The Secretary Senen Floreinsai i Paulau,
who studied at the NY University after receiving a Fulbright scolarship.
The Fulbright program was created in 1946, allegedly to favor culturale exchange, but in reality to
develop a network of officials aligned with US interests. Recipients of Fulbright scholarships are 
frequently put under surveillance by counter-espionage services of the whole world and conisderd as potential
CIA agents. Look it up.
Where was the first Catalonian embassy opened ? You guessed it, the US. And who was nominated as the first
head of the delagation ? Andrew Davis, who graduated from universities in Great Britain and Washington.

Admittedly, the history and the unity of France, Spain and Scotland are very different, but it doesn't 
change the fact that it's an EU goal on the long term.

Here's another interesting thing. This is an excerpt of a speech President Bill Clinton made in Germany in
front of Charlemagne's throne Aachen, (incorrectly) considered as the cradle of Europe:
&gt;""*Europe is alive with the sound of ancient place names being spoken again -- Catalonia, Piedmont, Lombardy
Silesia, Transylvania, Uthenia -- not in the name of separatism, but in the spirit of healthy pride and heritage.""*

Now why the fuck would we have the president of the USA encouraging the policy of regions, regions that were unified under Republics
more than 200 years ago ?

Can you imagine Hollande or Merkel going to Plymouth Rock where the Mayflower landed, and make speeches about
the creation of regions amd promoting teaching the languages of the Apache, Cherokee, Chippewa, Choctaw, Iroquois,
Lumbee, Navajo, Pueblo, Sioux and many, many others spoken by about 2 million people ?

Can you see the double-standard here ?

strangely, diversity is good for Europe, not for the USA.

Take a good hard look at what's been happening over the last 30 years: *Divide and Conquer.*
The Yugoslavia example, which was a unified country was shattered, with European troops
breaking up Serbia, creating Kosovo out of nothing. Did you know Kosovo is now one of most important US military
base in the world ? It's a pseudo-independent state, it's in fact completely under US control.

Yugoslavia was the spearhead of the non-aligned countries under Tito, it's now reduced to nothingness.
Slovenia is in the EU, Croatia will join in a month or so.

*Divide and Conquer.*

Here's the Soviet example, who do you think benefited from the disintegration of the USSR ?
The USA who now have a foothold in Georgia (depends on the mood), in Ukraine, in Lithuania, in Latvia,
in Estonia, which is now part of the EU construction; who had a hand behind the revolutions in Central Asia ?


Who's supporting separatist movements in China and Tibet ? Why Tibet ? Because it's the geopolitical balcony
dominating over India, the Gange and China, why do you think we're hearing so much about he Dalai Lama ?

Muslim disintegration, Irak disintegration, Lybia, South Sudan, Syria...next on the following episode

*Divide and Conquer.*

I'll have you know the French ecologist party(who's ultra-pro-EU btw) tried to have France give over its seat at 
the UN's Security Council to the EU. Food for thought:
88% of the EU member states were in favor of initiating war on Irak. France was the only one among the 25 to be
against it(Belgium and Germany were neutral).

In 2003 France prevented UN's green-light to begin the war in Irak;
this didn't prevent the US to have its military intervention, making the war completely illegal with regards 
to international law, the US still bear the mark of shame 10 years after the events.

France saved international law and somewhat preserved the trust put into the UN by 80% by the Muslim world, South
America, China, the orthodox world.

What would have happened if France didn't have its seat at the Security Council ?  Don't you think the US would've preferred a small, divided country, aligned with its interests ? 

That wouldn't be surprising, since the ""Fathers of Europe"" were financed by the CIA, [as the Daily Telegraph reported.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1356047/Euro-federalists-financed-by-US-spy-chiefs.html).

&gt;Per tutto il giorno di oggi sono stato accusato su Facebook di sostenere una candidatura, quella di Romano Prodi. Adesso l'accusa é opposta: aver complottato contro la candidatura Prodi. Se non ci fosse di mezzo l'Italia ci sarebbe da ridere. Primo punto: io le cose le dico in faccia, sempre. I doppiogiochisti non mi piacciono. Se dico che sosteniamo Prodi, lo facciamo. Se andiamo contro Marini lo diciamo a viso aperto. Secondo punto: il Quirinale richiede per definizione una persona esperta e competente. Lasciatevelo dire da rottamatore, il Quirinale non si trova il candidato ""nuovo"". Il Presidente della Repubblica deve avere caratura internazionale e senso dello stato: Prodi sarebbe stato un ottimo presidente. Ma lo hanno fatto fuori alcuni parlamentari PD che al mattino avevano applaudito la sua designazione a scena aperta. Occorre dire a questi rappresentanti del popolo che non si fa così: si deve avere il coraggio delle proprie azioni. Io non sono un grande elettore e non ho mai espresso UN candidato. Ho sempre detto che ce ne sono molti, donne e uomini. Chi ha la responsabilità di guidare il partito adesso abbia la lucidità di indicare una soluzione autorevole, per l'Italia.

Fact is, though, the CDU/CSU are the hardliners when it comes to immigration, citizenship etc, while the left, for a long time, turned an ideological blind eye to actual problems.

True and I never doubted that.

&gt;Anti-Zionism is common in the left, which may drift into anti-Semitism (but usually doesn't), but even if it does it still is a completely different beast from ""old school"" anti-Semitism. Which you won't find in CDU policies, but in their voting base.

I very much doubt that, seeing that the CDU's voting base is mostly older and economical better situated than the SPD's or the Linke. They might be more anti-immigration but anti-semits they generally aren't. There is a reason why the CDU has a lot of jewish politicians. Btw. oh they are just anti-zionist isn't a very good argument either, because it means that they want to get rid of the Israeli state. I don't know about you but I have my problems with that attitude. 

&gt;Fact is, though, the CDU/CSU are the hardliners when it comes to immigration, citizenship etc ...

They are hardly hardliners (pun not intended), the Schengen agreement was signed while Kohl was in power and I don't see any moves from Merkel to restrict non-EU immigration more. Now they are probably won't be open up Germany to more unskilled immigration but I don't have any problems with that. 

&gt;while the left, for a long time, turned an ideological blind eye to actual problems.

So the CDU is anti-immigrant while the left is just turning a blind eye, well that works out nice for you, doesn't it. 

&gt;CDU/CSU states also are regularly way more authoritarian,

They may be more authoritarian but you make it sound like a Orwellian nightmare. I think Bavaria is hardly that bad, also 

&gt;and have a bigger problem with police violence, including against minorities, immigrant or not.

I wholehardly disagree. You will will find even more problems in SPD favorites like NRW and Berlin.

 - Ensuite, les tests en eux même, prise de sang.
 - Il te diront quand repasser (pas super rapide).

And if there are differences in quantity is regrettably beyond me, sorry.

Second Question: The parties on the left spectrum, SPD, Die Linke, Die Grünen, are generally for more social programms and CDU/CSU are fiscally more conservative.    
Attention! Over-generalisation ahead: you will probably read somewhere that the CDU/CSU are devils children who would like nothing more to get rid of all those pesky social programms, but seeing that most of the last 20 years the CDU was in power and we are still a social-market democrasy, that claim might be a bit overdone. Also the last big cut was actually done by the SPD.

Last question: Politicians in Germany tend to toe the party line, the individiual politician is a lot less important in German politics then they are in the US. Now everyone makes statements on how there should be more done to help those who are less fortunate, saying that social programms should be cut even more would probably be a political suicide for any politician, doesn't matter his party affiliation.  But the most outspoken will as always be found in the opposition.

The problem with rule breaking is that any form of actual punishment against a 'rogue' member state would unravel the EU almost immediately.  An us vs. them mentality would form like never before.  Just look at Greece, with the right words you can twist a voluntary bail-out as an evil coercive attempt to destroy the nation's economic foundations; so how would they react to a literal punishment?

On top of that a punishment seems iffy when you take sovereignty into consideration. I'd still favor a system where members would really have something to lose if they break the rules repeatedly and on purpose.  I also don't support countries like Sweden ""bending"" the rules by de facto refusing the Euro or those in Eastern Europe delaying it on purpose.

I'll grant you that ""Chongqing"" doesn't ring any bells, but I'm pretty sure Arunachal Pradesh is a Himalayan state in northeastern India whose territory is under dispute between China and India because India's claim is based on a British-Tibetan treaty that China says Tibet was not empowered to sign and is therefore invalid.

If it is unfair to expect Europeans to be familiar with our states, then it is certainly hypocritical to act all superior when Americans aren't familiar with the republics within the Russian Federation.

&gt;What about things like movement rights for asylum seekers? The list is endless, while no NPD, the CDU does take a hard stance.

That doesn't make them racist, that makes the conservative.     
Here is your thinking: ""Why not give asylum seekers movement rights or even working rights.""     
Here is the CDU's thinking: ""Because then we would have a lot, a looooot more Asylum seekers in our country who probably won't be able to support themselves even with working rights.""

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I don't equate economic rule breaking with a demographic deficit per se. The problem with rule breaking is that any form of actual punishment would unravel the EU almost immediately. An us vs. them mentality would form like never before. Just look at Greece, with the right words you can twist a voluntary bail-out as an evil coercive attempt to destroy the nation's economic foundations; so how would they react to a literal punishment?


Well, the system we have now isn't working, is it? So, then we have to change it - *and we have to vote about that change*. Something has to be done, don't you agree? 

Economic rule breaking is undemocratic per se. Look at the Maastricht treaty. It was democratically decided that each country was responsible for their own debt and that no one would bail anyone else out. Also, that the ECB should not intervene to save individual countries. How can such a clear rule breaking that goes on every single day not be undemocratic? 

Are you saying it is better to go on being undemocratic and not following the law? For how long, and who are decides that? I'd like to know that, and who decided that too? I know you can't answer that, but it is sort of the point :-). Since you, and no one can answer that perhaps it would be better if we, and the EU, decided to stick to the written agreements? 



&gt;Do you refer to the bail-outs in general? 

Yes, and everything they entangle. THe ECB statues *specifically* states for example that indivudual countries should not be supported in the way they are buying bonds etc, but of course I refer to the bail outs and everything else. For God's sake, it was a condition for the Germans, that they should not be responsible for anyone else's debt, if they were to give up the D-Mark. 

So, don't you think it would be right to vote about the clear breaking of the rules? 

If other officials behaved like the ECB board members, they would immediately be fired. Imagine a judge ignoring the law, or an accountant, ignoring the accounting rules, in fact doing everything exactly opposite. Do you think it is democratic to have *unelected* people, going against the law and not being fired?  What gave them the right to do this? Would you like all officials to behave like this? 


&gt; While I'm not a fan of saving wealthy bankers I believe that a total banking system collapse could easily have occurred in the last 5 years without action being taken against the will of the voters.

A) the individual countries could have saved their own banks, Germany could have saved theirs, France theirs etc. That is *not* against the rules, which the current saves is. And, countries like Estonia, (the poorest member of the EZ btw) and Finland wouldn't have to bail out German and Greek banks. And, perhaps a bit beside the point, but I must say it is also the most moronic bank save I have seen. 


B) That is not for you to judge, or decide. It is up to the voters. I am very sure that the voters want their banks saved too - but they have a right to have a say. Also, if the voters had a say, perhaps the bank saves would actually been smarter, not idiotic.

C) Above all - how can you defend a continuous breaking of the law? 

Why do we not get to vote about what is happening? If they can't follow the treaty or statues, write new ones, or *keep following the old ones*



&gt;Sometimes what people want doesn't exactly jive with what they need; but the question of ""should the European people be allowed to vote themselves into destitution"" is a difficult one that requires a lot of thinking.

That is the exact argument that politicians use when they do not want us to vote about the breaking of the treaty, new treaties, bail outs, etc. 

At the end of the day, the EU is not even attempting to behave like a legal, legitimate union anymore, it is an ad hoc procedure that changes every day. And, we got less and less to say about it. 

Above all, the EZ seem to have missed a vital point. A currency union, and a union is supposed to be something good. Countries are supposed to benefit from it, and want to be there, not fight to stay out. Also, it is not supposed to contribute to a continous collapse of economies, or being anti-democratic. If that is the case, one should take a close look at what is going on and change ones behaviour. That is not happening in the EZ, not at all. 

How does anyone expect anything sustainable to be built in a world where  no one follows the laws and treaties aren't worth the paper it is written upon?

A democracy voted Hitler into power.  I do not think it is a particularly good political system.  Neither do I think communism is, or Fascism, or a technocracy for that matter, or anything else I could name off the top of my head (perhaps some combination of benevolent AI dictator + meritocracy).  I'm not going to pretend that I know what political system is best for Europe but the will of the people should not be taken as the divine truth.  If we let the population decide on literally every aspect of the law, social order would be untenable, racism would be institutionalized in a heartbeat, several countries could regain the death penalty etc etc.

People are stupid.  Bottom line.  Letting lots of stupid people determine what a smaller amount of less stupid people need to live like seems like a horrible system to me.  I think I'm pretty stupid too and I certainly don't think I'm qualified to make votes based on economic policy of various politicians.

All of that being said I'll have to answer your many questions simultaneously by outlining what problems I have with the current situation and what I personally would like to see happen, not guaranteeing of course that it really is the best solution:

There should immediately be a referendum within EU member states as to whether or not the ECB should be granted the necessary authority to deal with the crisis rapidly.  The ECB should then be given the status to act as such at least in the countries that voted yes in the referendum.  If this process conflicts with current EU law than I believe a reform is in order, no reason to pretend it is a currently flawless legal framework.

I believe that the core EU nations that I mentioned before should begin to move towards a much closer political and fiscal union.  I believe that something as simple as lines being redrawn on a map can powerfully influence the mindset of entire populations to begin thinking of ""we"" and not ""them.""  First countries should be Benelux+Germany because despite what you hear in the news these are extremely stable, generally responsible countries that would actually have a shot at pulling it off and presenting a successful model to the remainder of the Union.  An official confederation would probably be the best we could do in 10 years. 

I believe that states that willingly flaunt EU ""rules"" should have the possibility to be ejected from the Union depending on the severity and frequency of the breaches (only in the worst case, military take over or genocide or something) while minor infractions should be punishable by the loss of voting power within the EU.  Instead of my speculation I'd prefer a real study into what sort of punishments could be brought to bear without damaging the integrity of the Union.  Suggestions?  

I do not agree with you that it is up to the voters on whether or not a bank should be saved.  I would rather agree there be a metric in place to determine whether a bank deserves to be saved or not depending on their previous behavior and current direction.  Mathematics &gt; angry people with groupthink.

I also starkly disagree with your opinion of the Euro itself but this is another discussion.  I also disagree that all the countries could have saved their own banks.  Your opinion seems to be ""because it isn't working, we must move backwards"", while mine is ""we must move forewords"", not exactly ""more Europe"" but I believe the problem is that we've moved half-way to a goal which leaves us in a spot with all the weaknesses but none of the strengths of a weird half-union.  A full union precludes the ""breaking the rules"" you are so concerned about.

&gt;  ""Because then we would have a lot, a looooot more Asylum seekers in our country who probably won't be able to support themselves even with working rights.""

You mean when we allow people living in Hamburg to visit others over the border in Holstein, then people all over the world are going to start wars and install oppressive regimes so that they can get asylum, here?

Such a complete mischaracterisation of asylum seekers is standard fare in xenophobic circles. These people aren't here for economic reason, you don't get asylum for that.

As to the work issue: I acknowledge the danger in opening the ordinary work market for asylum seekers. If I had my way, they'd be able to earn some pocket money by volunteering in civil defence, with a special emphasis on training in providing foreign aid. It really can't hurt to have an army of people willing and capable to re-build their country ready once the situation at home gets better.

At the same time, they have something sensible to do, which alleviates all kinds of social problems.

true,i_love_pasta,ITAL,Italy,"We can't right now. We need a President of the Republic first, he is the one with the power to dissolve the chambers (I wonder if it's the correct translation in English for ""send the MPs home""). That's what we are trying to elect right now.

Actually (warning: this is just a wild speculation on my side), this could actually lead to a government being made earlier. The PD is divided is two factions, half of it wants to ask for the 5 Stars' help to form a government on some shared ideas, the other half (well, less than half, but relevant) wants to govern with Berlusconi. Bersani got caught in the middle: he promised to his voters ""Never with Berlusconi"" and that's is what everyone voting centre-left wants (with the exception of that group of MPs entrenched on their chairs in the parliament), but also fought fiercely against Grillo (and Grillo fought even more fiercely against him). So everything will depend on who will take the lead after him. Now they really look without a direction.

For this presidential election first they proposed the name of Marini, a guy liked by Berlusconi, with the aim of forging a government with his party, Popolo delle Libertà. The PDL voted Marini and the PD split itself and didn't vote him. Today, after an assembly of theirs MPs, they decided unanimously for the strongest name they hald, former President of the Council and of the European Commission Prodi, ignoring theirs ally, SEL, asking for the candidacy of Rodotà, because Grillo is asking for the same name and they didn't want to concede to them, with the hope of getting some needed votes from some people of the M5S or the Monti's party, Scelta Civica. What happens? An internal feud, 25% of them didn't vote for the very same guy they nominated earlier (for the presidential election the vote is secret). Now their secretary and their president are resigning.

The M5S had promised full support for a government this morning if the PD voted for Rodotà, but who knows what they will do after this self inflicted shitstorm?

Anyway, whatever the direction the PD take, they will make a government. If they go with Grillo, the government will probably be short, they will make some of those shared reform as the electoral reform (the law we have now is foolish) and the law on the conflict of interests (so Berlusconi won't be eligible). I'd say the government will be short lived because Grillo has got most of his voters saying that he is different from the others and will not mix. If they choose to go with Berlusconi, they will alienate a lot of their voters forever. Maybe the governemtn will last longer because the day it falls will be the day all their voter will vote Grillo.

The PD HAS to form a government. It is necessary now if we want to constitute one (majority of seats in the Chamber of the Deputies) and won't get any vote if they go to an election after this trainwreck. I don't know who would be able to win between Berlusconi and Grillo. Both are bound to get more votes. Anyway, it could still be possible that no majority is to be found thanks to our electoral law (explicitly written to even out the results of the 2006 elections so that the PD wouldn't have a clear majority back then).

I could explain it better than with this rant, but now I'm just really angry at this guys giving Berlusconi another chance to survive.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;It seems that you value democracy above all else, including economic reality.

If other countries and people also valued democracy and following of the law, the economic reality *would* be different, and in a good way. For example, less corruption in the EU, Greece, Italy would have never been in the Euro etc...

&gt; democracy voted Hitler into power. 

I am sorry, but that is Goodwin :-). 

&gt; I'm not going to pretend that I know what political system is best for Europe but the will of the people should not be taken as the divine truth.

Since you Goodwined us, I  am going to quote Churchill here. ""Democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others that have been tried"" Sums up my feeling. If you can find a benevolent, all knowing wise dictator that can rule the world I am all for it, but I don't think that is very likely, so I think we should run with what we have. 

It seems that while not overly fond of it (who is really) you do want democracy. Then you have to agree with me that the way that the EU is heading is *not* democratic. Don't you agree? 


&gt;There should immediately be a referendum within EU member states as to whether or not the ECB should be granted the necessary authority to deal with the crisis painfully. The ECB should then be given the status to act as such at least in the countries that voted yes in the referendum. If this process conflicts with current EU law than I believe a reform is in order, no reason to pretend it is a currently flawless legal framework.

Yes, but what does it says about the ""democracy"" or about the EU that people do not get the chance to do this? And, what if the people say no? Don't you agree then it is horrible what the EU are doing - not letting people vote. You yourself says it should immediately be a referendum.

And, I agree, of course the rules should be changed if the people wanted to. I however think that chance is abyssmal - after all, why would the Finns vote yes to pay off Greece's debt? 

&gt;I believe that the core EU nations that I mentioned before should begin to move towards a much closer political and fiscal union. I believe that something as simple as lines being redrawn on a map can powerfully influence the mindset of entire populations to begin thinking of ""we"" and not ""them."" First countries should be Benelux+Germany because despite what you hear in the news these are extremely stable, generally responsible countries that would actually have a shot at pulling it off and presenting a successful model to the remainder of the Union. An official confederation would probably be the best we could do in 10 years. 

 Do you think this should happen with or without a referendum? What if they say no?

&gt;Suggestions? 

Well, I do not really believe in the United States of Europe for a multitude of reasons, so I don't really have any. The only way I can see is making a United states of Europe, where we have enormous (much more than the US) internal transfers, a strong federal government that implements it, strong punishments etc, and no national sovereignity whatsoever of course. In fact, you are asking me to describe one of my nightmares. :-). I am looking a bit towards China and Russia in the way it would be governed. Don't really like to think about it, but perhaps copying China would be good........


&gt; I also disagree that all the countries could have saved their own banks. 

But do you think it is right that Estonia has to save Greece's banks? Finland? Finland spend 7-8 %, and Sweden 3-4 % of their GDP's in their bank saves, and that was not asking money from anyone else. Yet Finland all of a sudden have to save German banks? It is beyond unfair. 

A  fund could have been set up for the countries that could not have saved their own banks. As it is now, the undemocratic EZ forced the poorest member of the EZ to save German banks. 


 

&gt;""we must move forewords"", not exactly ""more Europe"" 

But your way of moving forward either contains votes that will never ever happen, or ignoring the law, the treaties and the will of the people for the forseeable future. What you are talking about it a dream. You say you want votes- do you honestly think people are going to get a chance to vote about the ECB? 

I do not agree with you anyway,  since I do not want a United States of Europe, but it is another issue, just like you disagree with me about the Euro.  However, the way you are talking about going forward, if I follow your train of thought, seems to me to be very much of an overly optimistic  (I'd call you folkpartist if you were Swedish. Don't worry, nothing insulting, it is just our pro EU party who are liberals and overly optimistic. Everything can be solved by more EU....) :-). We are not getting to vote, not about the ECB, not about new treaties, not about bail outs - nothing. So, if the votes that you dream about do not happen, do you *still* think the EU should continue to integrate, becoming a United States of Europe?  Even if the people do not get a chance to vote, or do you value the chance to vote more? I'd really like you to answer that one, if you don't mind.

I believe that what you call a democratic deficit is not one nor does it represent a barrier to integration.

You act as if integration is impossible because you're seriously bothered that you have to help the rest of Europe stay prosperous and strong without getting to say ""no"".  You blame this on a lack of democracy which reveals a fundamental disconnect between your interpretation of representative democracy and its actual function.  The EU is such a democracy and I do not understand why you cannot understand that not all actions taken by government require a referendum or public consensus. 

The China remarks are just silly.

On top of that I find your views to be rather selfish, although this is irrelevant to their validity.  Also I hope you reconsider your views on the merits of direct democracy which you advocate without mentioning by name.

Il punto è che D'Alema rappresenta il più grande caso di ""io ve l'avevo detto"" della storia della sinistra mondiale. Riassunto delle puntate precedenti

* Compare Berlusconi. Che è un marziano, e che susseguentemente da marziano, lui assieme a chi lo vota, viene trattato. Dopo un po' si vota, e Berlusconi fa un culo così a tutti. Dopo un po' si rivota e, sempre perché il Mattarellum era una cosa seria mica come la vergogna di adesso, Berlusconi prende più voti ma meno seggi degli altri.

* Compare D'Alema. La cui idea è che serva una radicale riforma di sistema e che questa riforma non possa non passare dal riconoscimento politico di Berlusconi, lui assieme a chi lo vota. Bicamerale. Che, facendo leva sulla segaggine di Berlusconi stesso, viene ammazzata subito. Questo perché si è deciso che lo scontro con Berlusconi va radicalizzato. Dopo un po' si vota, e Berlusconi fa un culo così a tutti.

* Compare Travaglio. Il bisogno di sentirsi dire che Berlusconi, lui assieme a chi lo vota, non appartiene alla razza umana diventa ufficialmente un segmento di mercato. Beppe Grillo apre un sito con le prove che Berlusconi è il capo della mafia. Dopo un po' si vota, e Berlusconi prende gli stessi voti ma meno seggi degli altri. D'Alema chiede se nessuno si ricorda della sua idea dell'altra volta (che adesso comporterebbe mandarlo al Quirinale, ma questo è un dettaglio) ma viene ammazzato subito. Dopo un po' si vota, e Berlusconi fa un culo così a tutti.

* Compare Ruby. Berlusconi, lui assieme a chi lo vota, sprofonda nella vergogna. Champagne e monetine. Trattative su come dividersi le spoglie. Dopo un po' si vota, e Berlusconi prende gli stessi voti e meno seggi degli altri. E domattina si prende il lusso di fare dei nomi per la presidenza della Repubblica.

D'Alema rappresenta l'idea che debba esserci un'alternativa a vent'anni di demonizzazione non tanto di Berlusconi (che a non demonizzare un po' di fatica la fai) quanto della gente che da Berlusconi si sente rappresentata. Gente che, per motivi diversi - nessuno dei quali in teoria dovrebbero nemmeno essere cazzi nostri - vota Berlusconi. E non lo fa perché è una casalinga ignorante che guarda il tg4 (e poi un giorno qualcuno mi spiegherà cosa cazzo avranno mai fatto di male le casalinghe ignoranti che guardano il tg4 per meritarsi tanto disprezzo) o perché è della mafia. Lo fa perché, come sempre in Italia da che esiste il suffragio universale, fa parte di una maggioranza che non è di sinistra.

D'Alema rappresenta l'idea che tapparsi le orecchie e dire silviotroiepidùe non serva a un cazzo. Non solo non toglie voti a Berlusconi (anzi, più lo tratti da appestato più lui ci marcia), ma alleva una base incazzosissima che non vede l'ora di saltarti al collo se solo ti azzardi a salutarli, quelli là. Una base i cui figli, nativi berlusconiani, stanno diventando maggiorenni in questi giorni. E votano Grillo, rinfacciando ai padri di essere collusi col marcio sistema dell'inciucio (i padri ricordano quando andavano alle fiaccolate ai tempi di Mani pulite e un po' muoiono dentro).

D'Alema rappresenta l'idea che a forza di fare finta che Berlusconi, lui assieme a chi lo vota, sia meno umano di noi si finisce a diventare più stronzi di lui.

La verità è che D'Alema è molto sopravvalutato.

Here I even agree with Fotopoulos that some of the ""rich"" are being excused due to their connections/money etc. About 70% of what he claimed has to be true, but at the same time about 70% of what is attributed to the deko thiefs also is true. Also lots of the commenters really sound like shills lol, that's the first article I've found such people on the pro memorandum side.

I already gave an example of how the greek state is easily exploited, usually with a nationalist/""proletarian"" excuse, by both the rich and corrupt and the low to middle class ""armies of voters"" after the easy job with the high salary. And also how them not being severed by at least 10% and starting with the most corrupt, isn't egalitarian in any way. And it also leaves too many doors open. They should at least give up on the ""public sector employees can't get fired"" right, what the hell?

Greece needs to think in terms of activity/production/innovation instead of fighting the EU for a bigger budget. If all those efforts are met with ""we'll work for Bulgarian salaries"", or if say it's tied to the universities or sth, then the people hiring their cousins to do phd's and steal the educational subsidies going on about how ""the markets will poison the freedom of research"", and at the same time the status quo of the public sector and the parfyades of it is untouchable, then we are going anywhere. Also army men / police / beaurocrats / teachers / priests / afisokolites / apofoitoi iek syndikaliston deko, are starting to get undesirable.

They had also excluded data from Canada, New Zealand, and Australia — all countries that experienced solid growth during periods of high debt and would thus undercut their thesis that high debt forestalls growth.

Some countries grew while taking up debt, holy jesus fuck, we must stop austerity right away! Let Portugal and Spain and Greece flourish under non-stop government spending!

&gt;Still, Herndon holds out hope. He calls austerity policies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere ""counterproductive,"" and implies that part of why he took up the study of Reinhart and Rogoff's study was to question the benefits of current economic policy. ""I have social motivations,"" he says. ""I care deeply about how policy affects people.""

Yes, it's counterproductive to have a balanced budget. What states who care about its people should do is ignore their obligations and just spend money on the people without taking anything away from the people and without paying their creditors.

Ai grillini ha provato a dargli la bocca, ma questi niente, vogliono il culo col massaggio speciale aggiunto e un buono per un amico. 

Son tante belle parole quelle di grillo sulla compenetrazione della politica, e poi mi dice ""mi commuovo perchè un nostro deputato ha fatto un intervento sull'agricoltura bellissimo, perchè è un agricoltore"". Ma allora sei veramente una testa di cazzo. Nulla togliendo alla nobiltà contadina, nella mia umile e ignorante opinione, cittadino Grillo, mi commuovo quando sento parlare un politico perchè è un politico. cristo d'un dio. Chi ci mettiamo come presidente dunque? uno che fa il presidente? Abbernascone non aspetta altro. Ma vacci tu, coglionaccio, a fare il PdR, che vediamo come te la cavi, invece di fare il figo dietro schiere di rincoglioniti che non hanno ancora capito quanto cazzo sei pericoloso.

Cambiamento! Non Voteremo le vecchie facce!

""ok - dice Bersani - eccovi prodi""

""no! rodotà o morte! largo al nuovo (80 anni suonati) che avanza!""

ma dio. io mi chiedo.

Dice: colpa di Renzi. Si e no. Renzi è un politico pieno di difetti come tutti i politici, e in questa campagna elettorale ha aperto troppo a berlusconi per andare da qualunque parte. Spero quasi in civati leader del partito. Ma ci beccheremo Letta, col suo carisma inesistente.

Dice: ""Ed ora scissione? Ben venga!"" ma ben venga dove. ma dove cazzo andiamo. Tralasciando il discorso di SEL che dovrebbe essere squalificata dalla politica (""siamo nella coalizione PD ma votiamo come M5S perchè siamo più belli e mostriamo loro che siamo simili e se fanno il governello loro ci danno i ministeri, gne gne""), Scissione vuol dire tornare a quando c'era Rifondazione, PCI, PSI, PCL, PD, eccetera. Vuol dire che diciamo all'italia ""lol se ci votate andiamo in parlamentpo a battibeccare XD XD"".

dice: D'Alema non è il male. D'Alema viene pubblicato da Berlusconi. Chi dice di combattere la dittatura dall'interno è già complice (D. Luttazzi citava non so chi, Adenoidi, 2003, cercatevelo). Non voto uno che non solo va a letto col nemico, ma poi rimane pure la mattina a preparargli la colazione. Vedi anche: Renzi.

dice: Gli unici fedeli alla linea promessa rimangono i Grillini, sono vera espressione del volere del popolo. No. Questi prendono 20mil di voti (circa? boh), e poi fanno le loro quirinarie. Base elettorale delle quirinarie: circa 50k iscritti al sito (e iscritti da più di un anno!), Quindi rappresentanza del popolo un cazzo. Quando gli è stato proposto un candidato a loro vicino come Prodi, l'ordine di pepe è stato NON UN PASSO ALLO STRANIERO (mi ricorda qualcuno). Il fatto che casa pound sfilasse a Roma con il M5S dovrebbe far riflettere. Inoltre, non è difficile mantenere una linea gridata nelle orecchie da un leader di culto; è imbarazzante vedere le interviste dei deputati che ""non sapevo che fosse una cosa così lunga"" e ""dove sta scritto che deve avere 50 anni XDD"". 

Peraltro: ""dove sta scritto che deve avere 50 anni? largo ai giovani!"" e candidano Rodotà. Dovrebbero candidare Corrado, così fanno davvero i Dilettanti allo Sbaraglio.

Dice: e adesso che facciamo? A questa domanda ieri Civati ha risposto con onestà sconcertante: ""Me lo richieda domani, perchè ora come ora non lo so"". Non saprei davvero. Vedremo chi si sobbarca la fatica di portare ancora avanti la sinistra in questo baraccone di parlamento/politica/stato.

""I often find that nationalists vision of an independent Scotland is a wee bit optimistic. While Scotland is more left-wing than the UK as a whole, I think this is over-stated. I read a study a few years ago (similar to this one) that found that there is actually very little difference when people are asked about specific policies, rather than who they vote for. Since Thatcher (perhaps from slightly before) the Tories have been toxic in Scotland. They're viewed as anti-Scottish, and their image has been irreparably tarnished. However, I genuinely think that a centre-right party could do alright in Scotland if it had no relationship with the UK Conservatives. There are plenty of people who would vote for lower taxes, less immigration, harsher penalties for criminals, less welfare and so on. I don't think we'd develop in to the Scandinavian-style social democracy that is sometimes expected. A bit more left wing maybe, but not as significant a difference as is often believed.""
