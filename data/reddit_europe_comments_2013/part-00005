This is somewhat of a stereotype i.e. Parisians are rude when you do not know to deal with them (for instance, if you speak English to someone in the street, they will be rude ; if you try to speak French they will switch to English and not be rude. Just have to learn a few tricks). Sciences Po has ~50% of foreign students, HEC also have lots of them, this isn't really going to be a problem.

As for the 12th, most of the dispute and violence is centred near Ardoyne. The parade doesn't actually pass through the area but down a main road to the city centre. There is no alternative route and republicans definitely go out of their way to be offended there. If the OO were change some routes, the republican movement would move the disorder to another parade and the nothing would change but the location of the rioting.

When Germany wanted Southern European demand to draw Germany through the downturn of the economic cycle, Germany financed that demand with cheap credit, greatly assisting in the creation of the Southern European consumer boom and construction bubble.

When that overshot, as these things always do, Germany being nicely through the down period of its cycle chucked out the anchors, slammed on the austerity brakes, visiting enormous and misconceived misery on the South.

Of course the South had its part to play.

Of course the South needs the kind of structural reform that Germany has undergone.   

Labour law needs to be addressed.   Wages need to be realigned to value.   State spending has to be streamlined.

That's before we even get into thing like reform to inheritance and wider tax laws, educational and judicial systems.

true,AntisocialScientist,LGBT,Ruhr,"Schon harter Tobak. Sozialdemokratisierung der CDU, die FDP als funkelndes, unkorrumpierbares Leuchtfeuer der Freiheit in mitten von totalitären Parteien, Zweifel am Klimawandel und der ökologisch-industrielle Komplex, die Implikation, jede Steuersenkung würde auch sofort zu Wirtschaftswachstum führen (ohne ein Wort darüber, ob Wirtschaftswachstum überhaupt immer notwendig oder gut ist) und das alles gespickt mit Zitaten, denn andere zu zitieren klingt immer klug. Blicke aus dem Ausland, auch aus dem deutschsprachigen, auf Deutschland fühlen sich immer ein Bisschen so, wie Blicke in Paralleluniversen sein müssen ...

Eins von diesen Zitaten lässt aber den ganzen Artikel etwas redundant aussehen, nämlich das von Mises: «Der Hass gegen den Liberalismus ist das Einzige, in dem sich die Deutschen einig sind».

Wenn man das schon zitiert, warum es nicht einfach dabei belassen? Das mit dem Gedanken der Freiheit in Deutschland war doch noch nie so weit ausgebildet wie anderswo. Wer deutsch war und Freiheit wollte, der ging in die jungen vereinigten Staaten, und so hat jetzt jeder sechste US-Amerikaner deutsche Wurzeln, das sind stolze 50 Millionen. Langfristig betrachtet jedoch, gebracht hat es ihnen allein nicht viel. Nach anti-deutschen Sentiments im 1. Weltkrieg zwanghaft assimiliert und wie das mit der Freiheit in den USA aussieht, kann man jeden Tag auf r/politics überprüfen (aber bloß nicht in die Kommentare schauen).

Aber ich schweife massivst ab. Vielleicht hat Mises ja am Ende Recht. Den Spruch soll der '27 gebracht haben; sechs Jahre später beenden die Deutschen ihren 15-jährigen Flirt mit der Demokratie und errichten mit großem Hurrah, aber erst nachdem ihnen Ersatzkaiser Hindenburg das OK dafür gegeben hat, eine der schlimmeren Diktaturen der Geschichte. Die DDR war zwischen 1953 und 1989 fast vier Jahrzehnte lang ruhig, während die umliegenden osteuropäischen Sowjetkolonien eine nach der anderen in die Revolte gingen; erst Ungarn, dann die Tschechoslowakei, schlussendlich Polen. Die andauernd hohen Umfrage- und Wahlergebnisse der Linken im Osten lassen jedenfalls auf keine große Freiheitsliebe schließen, aber hier geht es um ganz Deutschland, und auf den ""Ossis"" rumzuhacken ist eh irgendwie affig. Die Geschichte deutscher Revolutionen ist eine Geschichte der Restoration und der Reaktion. Auf Napoleon folgt der Biedermeier, auf März 1848 der Realismus, auf desertierende Matrosen die Freikorps, Kapp- und Hitlerputsch.

Wobei man den deutschen und globalen (Neo-?)Liberalen (bzw. Libertaristen?) auch mal sagen muss: Es gibt auch Dinge zwischen Anarcho-Kapitalismus und Totalitarismus. Nicht jede Umverteilung, nicht jede Regulierung, nicht jede Bevormundung ist das Ende der Freiheit und die Einführung des Sozialismus, und die slippery slope ist ein Fehlschluss. Es gibt Politikfelder, in denen man mehr tun kann, als die Hände in die Taschen zu stecken und zu sagen ""ja, pssh, lassen wir den freien Markt das für uns richten"", und viele Freiheiten sind einen Dreck wert, wenn man nicht weiß, woher man die nächste Mahlzeit bekommt (da es soviele schlaue, moral-bezogene Zitate in dem Text gab, versuchen wir es mal mit Brecht). Das bundesrepublikanische Deutschland zumindest ist den Resultaten nach ganz gut damit gefahren, Freiheit à la carte zu betreiben, statt polito-religiösen Dogmen (zu Gunsten der Freiheit und / oder der Gerechtigkeit) zu verfallen.

Um ein ""zu lang; nicht gelesen"" bereitzustellen und endlich die Frage zu beantworten: Der Liberalismus in Deutschland hat das immense Pech, durch die FDP und durch Menschen, denen die FDP noch zu autoritär ist, vertreten zu sein.",0,1357691736,null,0,1357746227,0,c7tip2x,t3_16795i,t1_c7tip2x,t3_16795i,null,1430900067,7,false,de,t5_22i0,7

Lyon is a balanced city as it is very beautiful, way less expensive and overwhelming than Paris, and offers a great cultural life.

Sc po is very well located and has tons of international students. Many of my friends liked the classes over there but the atmosphere is sometimes known to be a bit too uptight and sophisticated.

Many of my friends and I studied abroad in Paris, and, while it was an amazing experience, it was very difficult to interact with French people and students apart from going to clubs and such. There were just too many Parisians, too many students, too many foreigners, and too many anglophones.   Last year, I lived in Avignon, whose university has a massive international student population. Like often hung out with like, but the Erasmus group was well organized and well integrated into regular university life, so I'd definitely would check out these universities' Erasmus pages to see what sort of events they offer.  Anyway, I know for sure that the Avignonese students were very friendly and there was a lot of intermingling, which I never found to be the case in Paris.

If I were you, I'd go for Strasbourg (with the caveat that I've never there and don't know anything about the university!) or Lyon 3. That being said, I had some friends at Sciences Po who actually found it academically challenging. This would probably not be your experience at other French universities. Personally, I wouldn't take this into (much) consideration. During an exchange, your educational experiences will be insignificant compared to those outside the classroom.

Five years later, the half brother Barnum is born. We follow the very different brothers growing up in the 60's and 70's in Oslo. Short grewn Barnum, son of a clown and a shopkeeper, is the artist who goes on many agonizing defeats, and sometimes saved by the more hard-hitting brother Fred. But Fred lives in silence and shadow hangs over him, carrying secrets. His questions troubles his  half-brother Barnum: ""Shall I kill your father for you, Barnum?

It's absurd to think that there is one culture in China when there are over 1 billion people living there. Anyhow, I don't believe we should look up to a brutal dictatorship like China.

I still don't understand how it increases national stability and you have no evidence that it does that. I already explained to you why it violates personal freedom. The state should never explicitly tell what to believe and what not to believe, what foods the person like and what values a person should have. A democratic country should protect freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom of religion. These concepts should apply for everyone, not only the indigenous population. These ideas are not compatible with forced assimilation.

You seem to think all immigrants are bad and are a burden for society. If they work and follow the law then they are helping it more than many other natives who are criminal or are living off society. As I said earlier there are many reasons to move to a different country. For example there might be a company who wants foreign expertise because there aren't enough Danes. There is also love where a person might want to live in Denmark because his or her SO comes from Denmark. Do you see these people as a burden? If these authoritarian and nationalist policies were set into place you would scare these types of people away because Denmark (or any other country) needs these types of people.

Also people are fleeing from countries which do not tolerate them for being different. I believe that we, the first world, should help some of these people to be free, especially when they flee here begging for mercy. They want to live here because they want to be free, not because they want to become Swedish or Danish.

With privilege comes duty... Yes I agree. They pay their taxes, don't commit crimes and function in society. Assimilate should never be a national duty.

I'd say Portugal and Spain have much in common in that regard with the UK as our empires were managed similarly. Although it's not as pronounced in our culture as we aren't really an island, just a peninsula with big ass mountains on the border, and we also never had the naval power the UK had although the Spanish thought they did for a while.  
  
I think Brits are misunderstood as having some unhealthy pride because of that sometimes, when actually they are just calling our attention to some of the problems that too much ""continental"" mentality and utopia fixation can bring. In fact, they were very vocal warning us of most of the problems we would get. They were also right.

*****
Credit Agricole has many branches and becomes a real nightmare for their customers when all they do is move to another city.
Send another registered letter to the branch in question, with ""En copy"" mentions in the top left corner of the letter.
Send a duplicate to their Head office, and optionally another to a lawyer if you have one or to an association if you join one...
Stupid, 3 letters when you want to do things right in this country?  
In your letter don't forget to mention the costs for all your communications, how time consuming it is and the strain it puts you through. If possible detailed bills from the post office (for the letters) and phone company (for the calls), you can black out any information that is of no use for justification... paper work, paper work, more paper work...ughh! :(  
Keep in mind that all I wrote above is more than likely pointless, French admin work is usually very slow. 
If everything appears to be prepared for court cases, it has an odd time warping reaction of speeding everything up. (That is why registered letters are always recommended in these situations)

Or alternatively decide that they want to quit the EU and do so. The obvious downside of this is that Britain quitting the EU right now will push the Eurozone even deeper into crisis, which is about the last thing we need right now.

I came to the UK two years ago, from Portugal. Perhaps we would all gain if we looked empathically to each other.

We could learn a lot from each other if we left national pride to sports, where competition is healthy.   
But we have to commit to it, trying to slowly work together may do worse. If we had commited to a fiscal/economic policy union along with the monetary union, perhaps Portugal wouldn't be as bad as it is (or if we still had the power to print money things could be different than now).  
The UK has the same language as most of the Internet and as most of the books. Because of this, a brit as more access to these resources and can even consume them faster than a portuguese, so it's easier for the brit to be more productive. Should we [tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_tax) the brits for having more opportunities than us? Or should we increase the general english level? We can only get along well if we understand each other well. We need one language that everyone in the EU can speak, and I think the brits should have their way on this matter (we get right-side traffic).  
In the end, what we all want is to secure the future of mankind. We have one planet with finite resources and maybe infinite demands.

However, with Britain not committing itself, Germany and France (and the other countries in NW Europe) do not have any choice than to partner with each other. 

It's ironical in the extreme that the reason why Britain is hesitating about the EU is basically that they seem to feel left out in the cold with their vision on the EU, but other countries have no choice to follow France and Germany if Britain doesn't commit itself to staying inside the EU. 
And thus the Rhineland economic model prevails on the mainland, and Britain feels even more left out, and the vicious circle is closed...

true,Akasa,UKGB,journey before destination,"&gt;I want Britain in the EU. It's for the benefit of everyone involved. In my opinion most Brits know that they would benefit from it but there is an unhealthy pride left from the colonial days that makes them hesitate.

This just isn't the case.

British people want self determination. Our links with Europe are not strong culturally enough to feel ok about a Belgian/German/Frenchman having a say about how we live our lives.

In parts of the UK they're having pretty much the same discussion as Scotland decide if they have enough in common economically and politically to mind having English,Welsh or Irish people decide how things might be in Scotland.

These are a collection of nations who together built the modern western world and even they are not sure about it.

Secondly there's a history of this nation being at risk, but never quite succumbing to the Great European powers (France, Spain and later Germany). A siege mentality can have an effect on a culture a deep sense of independence and doing things our own way.


Thirdly is the impression the EU gives as an institution and how it's represented here in the UK. The EU has the kind of issues most western governments have (waste,inefficiency, ""light"" corruption) we already have politicians in power and in opposition here who are all deeply unpopular, and having another superfluous lot in Brussels just doesn't make sense. Especially as they have proved themselves unable to tackle issues 

And lastly, culture. People on the continent seem to recognise that they're similar to each other and even the British. The wide spread acceptance of British/American culture and language has meant the opportunity to see how life is much the same in each nation and whatever differences that are evident they are small. The UK isn't consuming European Culture at a large scale, or if they are they don't understand that they are so there isn't the benifit of those lessons for the British. 

(This last one is sketchy, and based on nothing but my own meandering thought process bathed in what's likely to be my own ignorance so feel free to chime in)

When coupled with a few smaller nations like Greece and Portugal you can see that the political slant of the EU is gonig to be heavily influence by this group.

The UK by comparison has the like of Denmark, the Netherlands and to some extent Poland as natural allies. Germany, while it oftens tends to the UK position is also very keen to keep France onside. 

Furthermore, just like the UK France is very eager to wield a veto when its purpose suits, it is also very protectionist and this runs counter to much of what the more open economies want.

Nope. 80% of the Somalis don't enter the workforce at all. Only one in five even get any temporary work. The Iraqis, the far larger group, are at 60%. Now we're apparently going to take in a shitton of Syrians as well as the Neoliberal government showed in throwing in 8 billion to the Migration Board.

It's the craziness and pseudo-humanitarianism of the established parties that are now allowing the anti-immigration and anti-EU Swedish Democrats to rise astronomically. They're already polling as the third largest party and it's only been a single election since they got into Parliament. 

How crazy are these ""humanitarians""? At least three of the parliamentary parties want completely open borders and one stated as such openly recently which will ensure their failure to get into parliament next election. They refuse to use the term ""illegal immigrants"" preferring the newspeak ""paperless"" and there are networks connected to some parties that actively try to help illegals from getting caught.

British eurosceptics are afraid of Europe; particularly France and Germany.

The fear has some justification. Britain is *not* an equal partner to France or Germany. It should be but it's really not. Both have considerable influence over and sympathetic relationships with neighbouring countries. Not only this, but they have a more natural synergy with each other. And Britain is useless at forging alliances in Europe.

Britain will often find itself outvoted in Europe. It's influence is beneath what it might otherwise expect; it punches under its weight in Europe. The prospect of Britain having to adhere to laws that it opposed but were forced through by France and Germany is quite likely.

Of course, the answer to the Eurosceptics is that a law passed by France and Germany is likely to be quite a good law...

But yes, this is the root of the problem - a fear of demographics, a fear of being an unpopular minority in a European empire. Criticising the British for being uncooperative is a natural but unhelpful response as it serves to increase the fear.

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"Odin's beard, I don't even know where to begin to correct you.

&gt;China is multicultural. There are different languages and different cultures in China. There is not one universal Chinese culture. It's absurd to think that there is one culture in China when there are over 1 billion people living there. Anyhow, I don't believe we should look up to a brutal dictatorship like China.

You seem to have an extremely simplistic view of culture. Danish is not just *one* culture. It is several cultures mixed together. Chinese culture *do* exist and the mere notion that it does not is simply wrong.

&gt;I still don't understand how it increases national stability and you have no evidence that it does that.

Other than the absolutely obvious? How is it so incredibly difficult for you to understand that a nation consisting of a cohesive culture generally more stable than one of several non-cohesive cultures?

&gt;The state should never explicitly tell what to believe and what not to believe, what foods the person like and what values a person should have. A democratic country should protect freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom of religion.

You are contradicting yourself. Can you decide on one or the other? The first and most vital line of defence for freedom is to make sure the immigrant assimilate well into these new freedoms. That they understand the new society around them, and appreciate it and know they have the freedom to fuck off to North Korea if they don't like freedom. Assimilation is not *just* brainwashing. It is a convenience for all of us. Your view of it is skewed.

&gt;I already explained to you why it violates personal freedom. The state should never explicitly tell what to believe and what not to believe, what foods the person like and what values a person should have. A democratic country should protect freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom of religion. These concepts should apply for everyone, not only the indigenous population. These ideas are not compatible with forced assimilation.

Any truly free nation needs to limit its citizens, as silly as it sounds. If you want a stable society you *cannot* have people running around with guns killing people. That is a freedom the state take away from - your ""freedom"" to kill other people. And no, this is in fact a perfect comparison. The reason this freedom is taken away from you is because it serves the common good. So does assimilation of immigrants. So does forbidding rape. Theft. And other crimes. A society is built on inhibiting freedom to grant the freedoms that matters. If a certain freedom is a danger to society it should obviously be taken away.

&gt;You seem to think all immigrants are bad and are a burden for society.

The hell are you on about? I have said the exact opposite multiple times already. They are *not* a burden to society *if* they assimilate.

&gt;If they work and follow the law then they are helping it more than many other natives who are criminal or are living off society.

Like students? Bureaucrats? Healthcare workers? What if the immigrant spreads violent &lt;insert religion/ideology&gt; in his spare time? That is legal and certainly harmful to society.

&gt;For example there might be a company who wants foreign expertise because there aren't enough Danes. There is also love where a person might want to live in Denmark because his or her SO comes from Denmark. Do you see these people as a burden?

How would I know if I see them as a burden? I haven't met them, don't know who they are or where they come from. If I am to make broad generalizations then (IIRC) you can already within the EU simply move from one country to another and (given legislation) you can still vote in your nation for elections. I don't think we should give out citizenships to everyone that asks. It's stupid and naive to a fault. However I see no reason why they should not be able to work here and if in the EU (or Nordic Union) move here and live with their SO. I just don't think they should be allowed to vote and thus govern if they do not assimilate.

&gt;Also people are fleeing from countries which do not tolerate them for being different. I believe that we, the first world, should help some of these people to be free, especially when they flee here begging for mercy. They want to live here because they want to be free, not because they want to become Swedish or Danish.

And how the hell is that our problem? I'm sorry if I am being cold, but damn it, it is not the sole prerogative of Scandinavia to save a world of hungry orphans. Grow up. People run from their country. People die by the thousands. It is just not our job to pick up the trash these people leave in their wake. We're not Mommy and Daddy Earth. We're not even 1% of the entire human population for crying out loud. I'm perfectly fine with them coming here, but they have to *earn* it. If you want freedom, there's duty attached. There is a reason their society don't work - it's primitive and its population brainwashed.

&gt;Assimilate should never be a national duty.

And why not? Why are you so scared of requiring people to be Danish before they get Danish citizenship? What is so inherently wrong about that?

Why should we open our borders to everyone else, and let foreigners walk in without prohibition, and let them decide *our* nation's future? It's not bloody evil to limit and control immigration it is bloody sensible. ",0,1357734827,null,0,false,0,c7tryzb,t3_164q63,t1_c7tryzb,t1_c7tlfzh,null,1430904502,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,adamkex,SWED,Hungarian in disguise,"&gt; You seem to have an extremely simplistic view of culture. Danish is not just one culture. It is several cultures mixed together. Chinese culture do exist and the mere notion that it does not is simply wrong.

Of course there are variations in Danish culture. China is (obviously) a lot bigger country which leads to more variations and to more diverse variations.

&gt; Other than the absolutely obvious? How is it so incredibly difficult for you to understand that a nation consisting of a cohesive culture generally more stable than one of several non-cohesive cultures?

I asked if you had data supporting this. The children and grandchildren of immigrants will be culturally Danish or completely Danish. Also immigrants come from different cultures, there will be no rival big rival to Danish culture which threatens Denmark's stability.

&gt; You are contradicting yourself. Can you decide on one or the other? The first and most vital line of defence for freedom is to make sure the immigrant assimilate well into these new freedoms. That they understand the new society around them, and appreciate it and know they have the freedom to fuck off to North Korea if they don't like freedom. Assimilation is not just brainwashing. It is a convenience for all of us. Your view of it is skewed.

You have nothing supporting that assimilation is needed. What is needed that immigrants who come from dictatorships need to understand how European societies functions. I view ***forced*** assimilation as skewed. If immigrants, or anyone, pays taxes, follows laws, minds his or her own business then it is fine because there will be the rule of law and not anarchy. Doing this is compatible with freedom. I don't care if an immigrant assimilates or not. As long as they function as normal human beings then it is fine by me. I don't care if my neighbour sees him or herself as a Swede, Dane, Chinese or Iraqi. What I would care about if this person commits crimes and lives off the government.

&gt; Any truly free nation needs to limit its citizens, as silly as it sounds. If you want a stable society you cannot have people running around with guns killing people. That is a freedom the state take away from - your ""freedom"" to kill other people. And no, this is in fact a perfect comparison. The reason this freedom is taken away from you is because it serves the common good. So does assimilation of immigrants. So does forbidding rape. Theft. And other crimes. A society is built on inhibiting freedom to grant the freedoms that matters. If a certain freedom is a danger to society it should obviously be taken away.

I don't know what you are even talking about in this paragraph. There is no such thing as a freedom to kill or rape. It violates the freedom of the victim. I'm not suggesting anarchy. However there is the freedom of being a minority, being part of a different culture and practicing any religion. There is no way I want the society I live in trying to limit that.

&gt;The hell are you on about? I have said the exact opposite multiple times already. They are not a burden to society if they assimilate.

So if a person lives a normal life, paying tax, following laws, no crimes but doesn't assimilate then how is this person a burden? Do you even know what assimilation is? In our entire conversation you have been hostile to immigrants by forcing them to assimilate even if they have done nothing wrong and are contribution to society. You know you don't have to be Danish to contribute to Denmark.

&gt; Like students? Bureaucrats? Healthcare workers? What if the immigrant spreads violent &lt;insert religion/ideology&gt; in his spare time? That is legal and certainly harmful to society.

Students might stay. Don't forget that Danish students go to other countries as well. If bureaucrats are needed then they should come be welcome. Healthcare workers are very important, any sector which needs more workers which Denmark can't offer needs immigration. This is at least the case in Sweden where we need more healthcare workers. Hate speech and violence can be punished and if the person won't face torture or the death penalty then he or she can be deported. What if a Dane spreads violent and hateful ideologies? It's different because this person can't be deported but it's a lot more dangerous than what an immigrant can be. The obvious target audience would either be Danes if it is nazi propaganda and all people if it is violent communist propaganda.

&gt; How would I know if I see them as a burden? I haven't met them, don't know who they are or where they come from. If I am to make broad generalizations then (IIRC) you can already within the EU simply move from one country to another and (given legislation) you can still vote in your nation for elections. I don't think we should give out citizenships to everyone that asks. It's stupid and naive to a fault. However I see no reason why they should not be able to work here and if in the EU (or Nordic Union) move here and live with their SO. I just don't think they should be allowed to vote and thus govern if they do not assimilate.

I never said anything about citizenship. If I marry a woman from Iran and assuming I do it for love then how is it different than marrying a French woman? Why should these two be considered different?

&gt; And how the hell is that our problem? I'm sorry if I am being cold, but damn it, it is not the sole prerogative of Scandinavia to save a world of hungry orphans. Grow up. People run from their country. People die by the thousands. It is just not our job to pick up the trash these people leave in their wake. We're not Mommy and Daddy Earth. We're not even 1% of the entire human population for crying out loud. I'm perfectly fine with them coming here, but they have to earn it. If you want freedom, there's duty attached.

You are definitely being cold. I never said it's Scandinavia's task to do this. I think all countries who have the means to accept at least some refugees should do so. Of course this can't be forced however if more countries accept refugees then it evens out per capita. When Denmark restricted their immigration laws then more refugees seeked asylum in Sweden, essentially dumping them to us. Wouldn't you agree that if less people suffered the world would be a better place?

&gt; There is a reason their society don't work - it's primitive and its population brainwashed.

Or have you considered that these countries are brutal dictatorships run by religious zealots or by crazy people? Or that some of these countries are poor or that the wealth distribution is extremely uneven? Many western countries have benefited from colonialism which these countries have not. Do you honestly believe that countries like the UK would have been this good off if they had never colonized half of the world?

&gt; And why not? Why are you so scared of requiring people to be Danish before they get Danish citizenship? What is so inherently wrong about that? Why should we open our borders to everyone else, and let foreigners walk in without prohibition, and let them decide our nation's future? It's not bloody evil to limit and control immigration it is bloody sensible.

Why should the goal to be a Danish citizen? I don't think I could ever drop my national identity to gain citizenship in another country. Possibly I could become multinational and have multiple citizenships but I could never drop being Swedish. But as long as I contribute to society I don't see why I would be a burden.

If you read carefully, you'll find that the study by the IMF suggests that we put about 30 thousand to 50 thousand Education workers (not only teachers) in a special regime called ""mobilidade especial"". This way, they can be redirected to other functions or, indeed, maybe end up being fired (but only after some extended period, during which they are still paid and the State can't find any other function in which to place the worker).

Also, there are around 175.000 [(numbers from 2011)](http://www.pordata.pt/Portugal/Docentes+em+exercicio+nos+ensinos+pre+escolar++basico+e+secundario+total+e+por+nivel+de+ensino-240) active teachers in Portugal. So, there is no way that 50 thousand can mean 50% of the active teachers.

The 100 000 is for both asylum seekers and their relatives seeking asylum however the 34000(Which is a prognosis from earlier this year) is not including the relatives. You are just lying, spreading disinformation and cherry picking statistics that support your dissillusion.

&gt;The idea of pooling telecoms infrastructure emerged at a private meeting between Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, and bosses of Europe’s biggest groups, including Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Telecom Italia and Telefónica.

&gt;According to several people familiar with the discussions, the industry attendees left the meeting intent on exploring the idea, given their frustrations that Europe’s disjointed market has impeded their ability to compete. The executives’ companies, which dominate the EU market through their various national subsidiaries, have been caught out by the continent’s wider financial difficulties and face new challenges from rival global technology groups that use their networks.

&gt;“The operators expressed a deep sense of frustration and agreed to bring constructive ideas of how a European market could work,” said one person familiar with the meeting. “Objections won’t come from Europe, they will be from the [EU’s 27 national] regulators.”

&gt;Establishing an EU-wide network-sharing agreement would be fraught with financial and technological obstacles, given the myriad differences in infrastructure and national rules. But it would bring the European market more in-line with the US and China markets, each of which has only three or four large groups. It could also yield consumer benefits, such as single pricing for telecoms and internet services across Europe.

&gt;Mr Almunia has taken a tough stance against national mergers that reduce competition. But he has indicated more openness to cross-border tie-ups that would help build a single EU market, generate cross-border services and drive digital investment.

&gt;In December, Mr Almunia said there could be “other ways than mergers to promote efficiency gains among operators, such as network-sharing agreements”. A private briefing document for Mr Almunia on telecoms industry consolidation, seen by the FT, notes that the commission has never assessed a mobile telecoms merger that created a unified, cross-border network.

&gt;In spite of the hurdles, senior industry insiders say it is highly significant that discussion has begun between in the telecoms industry, which is balancing a long-term decline in revenues at a critical moment for new investment in next-generation mobile and fibre line access.

&gt;One idea floated since the meeting is the creation of a “newco” structure to pool companies’ network infrastructures, along with the debt associated with these assets.

&gt;The new vehicle could be used on a wholesale basis by all telecoms groups, with potential financial incentives in place to compensate those that contribute their network. It would also have better access to funds, both public and private, to build out next-generation fibre networks.",0,1357742319,null,0,false,0,c7tt9um,t3_168wm2,t1_c7tt9um,t3_168wm2,null,1430905124,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

Yes, I accidentally linked the wrong one. It's fixed now and was a minute after the post was made. That was an early forecast of the year to come and has now been updated to the 100k. The link that's now there is the one I meant, forecasting 31k rising to 34k in 2012.

True, but it could take Palestine's route (UN observer state). Moreover, perhaps our perception is different, but world opinion seems to be going Kosovo's way. More and more countries recognize Kosovo every few months, and not the other way around (withdrawing recognition).

&gt; This is, without question, true. However, we're discussing the powder keg of Europe. So the question is when the next war will occur, not if it will. And when it does, and if Kosovo is involved, I see no reason for Serbia to not retake the land to which it retains a valid claim.

I see many reasons for it to not retake the land. If it tried, it'd renounce to its EU candidacy, its alliances, a free trade area, and condemn itself to languish behind Slovenia, Croatia and the rest of its former constituent parts.

Added to that, it would fail. Why would Serbia win a second war if it lost the first, especially with a permanent EU mission inside of Kosovo? Even the few remaining countries in the EU that don't recognize Kosovo would condemn such a unilateral move. What happens when Serbs start laying siege to Kosovar towns and cities? When the atrocities start pouring in? The world wouldn't allow it; it'd be the easiest intervention to approve.

Europe has been historically been a powder keg, but within the EU, it's been the longest period of uninterrupted peace since the Pax Romana.

I love target and clay shooting, and I would like to start collecting historic rifles one day, but I do not feel the need to arm myself on the street. I am not paranoid and do not fear invasion by the New World Order, or a tyrannical government, and I do not think that the majority of people should have an automatic right to be armed - certainly not without thorough checks and balances to ensure they won't go crazy with their weapons. Most people can barely be trusted with something as dangerous as a car, let alone a rifle which they do not respect and understand the safe use of.

I accept that to live in a (relatively) safe society, I may have to give up some privileges such as the ability to own more ""fun"" weapons (because if I was allowed, I would like to shoot automatic weapons so long as it was done in a safe manner on private land). I'd be fairly happy just to do target shooting on the weekends with a vintage Kar98K or Lee-Enfield rifle, and I do oppose excessively restrictive laws such as are found in Korea or Australia which nearly outlaw civilian firearm ownership entirely. If you can show yourself to be responsible and safe then I think you should be able to do shooting for sport or hunting.

The thrust of the main argument is that Westminster is outdated and no longer necessary for the governing of Scotland, also that Scotland would perform better with powers brought closer to home. But most of those that argue for this base it upon Scotland being within the EU so that the risks of being a small nation state are mitigated by being part of a large, flexible union. This is very much part of the SNP's proposals for an independent Scotland. 

I would go so far as to say that the reason the independence debate is happening is at all is because of the relative peace across Europe and the EU massively simplifying relations with our closest neighbours. The old fashioned nation state, largely an accident of wars and aristocratic marriage, is becoming increasingly defunct. This trend is mirrored across Europe by the numerous separatist groups that have made the news recently, most of which are pro EU.

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;I asked if you had data supporting this. The children and grandchildren of immigrants will be culturally Danish or completely Danish. Also immigrants come from different cultures, there will be no rival big rival to Danish culture which threatens Denmark's stability.

Not necessarily. In the cases of parallel societies they keep their foreign culture and often become troublesome for society. This is especially visible in Denmark.

&gt;You have nothing supporting that assimilation is needed. What is needed that immigrants who come from dictatorships need to understand how European societies functions. I view forced assimilation as skewed. If immigrants, or anyone, pays taxes, follows laws, minds his or her own business then it is fine because there will be the rule of law and not anarchy. Doing this is compatible with freedom. I don't care if an immigrant assimilates or not. As long as they function as normal human beings then it is fine by me. I don't care if my neighbour sees him or herself as a Swede, Dane, Chinese or Iraqi. What I would care about if this person commits crimes and lives off the government.

Is needed? Perhaps not, I am not psychic. Would be very beneficial? Certainly.

The problem with immigrants (generally from other cultural sphere) is that they come to your nation with an entirely different world view. Assimilation is a way to condition and help them be a productive member of society. And just to clarify - this is not forced assimilation - you are free to piss the hell off if you do not want to live there, forced would apply that you cannot do that. I'm okay with that you do not care if people assimilate, but some of us do care about the well being of our nation.

&gt;I don't know what you are even talking about in this paragraph. There is no such thing as a freedom to kill or rape. It violates the freedom of the victim. I'm not suggesting anarchy. However there is the freedom of being a minority, being part of a different culture and practicing any religion. There is no way I want the society I live in trying to limit that.

What I was trying to put out there was that there is no such thing as ultimate freedom without anarchy. You have to set the line somewhere, and the line is often put somewhere if it is harmful to the collective. Non-assimilating people are harmful to the collective. And minorities are fine, if they hold cultural or historical value, but minorities for the sake of it? No. That's just silly.

&gt;So if a person lives a normal life, paying tax, following laws, no crimes but doesn't assimilate then how is this person a burden? Do you even know what assimilation is? In our entire conversation you have been hostile to immigrants by forcing them to assimilate even if they have done nothing wrong and are contribution to society. You know you don't have to be Danish to contribute to Denmark.

How am I hostile? I am asking them to contribute if they want to live here. In what universe is that hostile? That's not hostility, that is asking for common bloody decency. All I am hearing is a lot of: 'but I dun wanna!' Fine. You don't want to contribute to society, go live in your own damn mudhole, but if you want to stay in our mudhole you have to play by our rules and conform to our muddy standards. We're not asking a lot, we're just saying don't run about naked in our mudhole and don't throw mud at other people.

You seem to think that by assimilation I mean large re-education centres guarded by military patrols and with extreme propaganda, but that is entirely not the case. I don't want them to eat propaganda, I want them to be educated. I want them to be able to defend themselves and their children perhaps against crazed extremism, I want them to be able to help their children in school - and many can't because they do not understand Danish, and I want them to live a peaceful normal life. And I want society to think well of them, to welcome them. Our current integration system is weak, flawed and has a complete and utter lack of assimilation because apparently it is a 'taboo' word and method. I think it is time we faced reality: Integration doesn't work. And in a decision of having to choose between assimilation and a complete stop to immigration, I would rather pick assimilation.

&gt;Students might stay. Don't forget that Danish students go to other countries as well. If bureaucrats are needed then they should come be welcome. Healthcare workers are very important, any sector which needs more workers which Denmark can't offer needs immigration. This is at least the case in Sweden where we need more healthcare workers. Hate speech and violence can be punished and if the person won't face torture or the death penalty then he or she can be deported. What if a Dane spreads violent and hateful ideologies? It's different because this person can't be deported but it's a lot more dangerous than what an immigrant can be. The obvious target audience would either be Danes if it is nazi propaganda and all people if it is violent communist propaganda.

I'm not condoning Nazism or Communism, but extremist Islam for example is obviously not Danish. It is a Middle-Eastern influence, and we can combat that through assimilation. But we don't so the problem persists. Nazism is a lot more difficult to swat, same with Communism. Luckily we don't have any people with actual power (or violent tendencies) that go about that these days. As with everything I think the cure (also for extremist Islam) is simply to educate people.

&gt;I never said anything about citizenship. If I marry a woman from Iran and assuming I do it for love then how is it different than marrying a French woman? Why should these two be considered different?

You will probably find it discriminatory, but it is still the truth: Different cultural spheres. French and Danish is very close compared to Danish and Iranian. Aside of that then we have obligations by being part of the EU.

&gt;You are definitely being cold. I never said it's Scandinavia's task to do this. I think all countries who have the means to accept at least some refugees should do so. Of course this can't be forced however if more countries accept refugees then it evens out per capita. When Denmark restricted their immigration laws then more refugees seeked asylum in Sweden, essentially dumping them to us. Wouldn't you agree that if less people suffered the world would be a better place?

Would it? I don't know. Perhaps. Maybe not. Don't get me wrong, I would love if we could just make the entire world sparkly and good, but reality is that the world is a dark place filled with violence, chaos and corruption. If you simply open for the flood without building yourself a proper boat to ride the wave then you're going to drown in it. It think that the mere fact we let some through is saintlike of us, sure, but I don't give my money to any charity, let alone all my money. It has to be controlled. The people that seek refuge here most learn that freedom and obligation is a two way street. You do not gain privilege without gaining duty.

&gt;Or have you considered that these countries are brutal dictatorships run by religious zealots or by crazy people? Or that some of these countries are poor or that the wealth distribution is extremely uneven?

I just said that. In the very thing you quoted. Seriously.

&gt;Many western countries have benefited from colonialism which these countries have not. Do you honestly believe that countries like the UK would have been this good off if they had never colonized half of the world?

No, but why does it matter? The age of imperialism is long gone and its every living proponent dead and buried.

&gt;Why should the goal to be a Danish citizen? I don't think I could ever drop my national identity to gain citizenship in another country. Possibly I could become multinational and have multiple citizenships but I could never drop being Swedish. But as long as I contribute to society I don't see why I would be a burden. It's your opinion that immigration has gone out of hand. Not everybody shares it.

I think this is part of the situation too, parties like the SNP and other independence movements can grow during peaceful times but it takes something to really push the movement to its goals like the current economical crisis. I don't think many people would really consider such a big change if they were comfortable with the way things are. Though the SNP did rise in popularity during some pretty good economical times.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Cyprus is that isn't [too] big [to fail], the euro isn't really threatened by whatever might happen to Cyprus. For the Cypriots themselves, it's an entirely different story, though.

The SPD and Greens so far have essentially covered for Merkel's failure to get a ""chancellor majority"" for her policies. If they announce they will vote ""no"" this time, they put her in a position where she will have to try and enforce party/coalition discipline to ensure a majority, and there's a good chance that she would fail to do so, which would be a major embarrassment that would highlight how dysfunctional her coalition is.  
For her, this would be pretty bad. To understand just how bad it would be, you need to know that her fraction in the parliament technically consists of two parties, her own CDU, which is the conservative party for all of Germany except Bavaria, and the CSU, the CDU's Bavarian ""sister party"". The CSU will face a state election on top of the federal one next year, and in the last one they had to enter a coalition with the FDP after failing to get a majority of their own for the first time in half a century. The bailout skeptics are largest within the FDP and the CSU.  
So, failure to get her own majority would not only expose the coalition with the FDP as a mess, which everybody knows, anyway (the current ""black-yellow"" constellation is ranked as one of the most unpopular ones in the polls, which is highly unusual), and would make it even more difficult for her to run an election campaign based on a continuation of the current government, it would also highlight a schism between the CDU and a campaigning Bavarian CSU.  
Meanwhile, the FDP is fighting for relevance, or even survival. They need 5% to enter parliament, but [[recent polls](http://www.spiegel.de/flash/0,,21034,00.html) put them at 4%, the very latest (today) even at only 2% (!). They might look at this as an opportunity to paint themselves as defenders of German taxpayers' money, but at the cost of the black-yellow coalition model. Traditionally, when the FDP is threatened to drop below 5%, ""loan votes"" of voters who would have normally voted for CDU/CSU keep them afloat. Whether they would do that after the FDP had dealt Merkel such a blow, and with the current state of the FDP, is anybody's guess. I don't know how large the conservatives' pool of followers who understand strategic voting is.

While I'm already at totally ignoring the effects it would have for Cypriots, let's stick to German politics, because (I think) this is getting really interesting. Imagine you're Merkel, just failed to get a majority for a major decision, and your partner in a dysfunctional coalition is about to drop out of the Bundestag in the upcoming election. What do you do?  
Well, she can hardly claim that she'd like to continue the ""successful coalition with the FDP"". Everybody knows this wouldn't be true, it would be by no means certain that there even would be an FDP to have a coalition with in parliament, and the CDU/CSU is far from getting a majority of their own. Also unusually, a potential ""Grand Coalition"" with the SPD is polling quite popular (sort of complimentary to the low polling of Black-Yellow, i.e., a consequence of the failure of the current one and a lack of alternative for conservatives), but it's not something you can run a campaign on, not to mention the theatrical laughs this would get from the SPD and the uncomfortable questions this would earn her from journalists. There is another model, a coalition with the Greens. This wouldn't be as much of a stretch as people outside of Germany probably think, but a stretch it would be none the less. That is to say, it would be a real possibility, but still not something to run a campaign on, especially since the Greens would, hands down, prefer a coalition with the SPD (and the SPD with the Greens).

Since nobody would enter a coalition with the Left, and almost certainly not with the Pirates, should they get in, in absence of the FDP the only real options would be a Grand Coalition between CDU/CSU and SPD, the Red Green coalition preferred by both SPD and the Greens, and a slight chance of a Black Green coalition between CDU/CSU and the Greens. Whether Red Green would have enough votes is doubtful, but there would be a decent chance if they'd let the current coalition butcher itself throughout the election campaign.

My guess is that there will be a majority for a Cypriot bailout after all, possibly with a few votes from the opposition helping out, and Merkel heading a Grand Coalition which eventually will emerge after agonizing negotiations after the election. A lot might happen until then, though. ",0,1357749221,null,0,false,0,c7tv5b1,t3_168rjm,t1_c7tv5b1,t1_c7trs6y,null,1430906071,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18

It is. And quite soon I'll be joining the labour market myself, so that hits close to home, but the problems we do have just can't be blamed on the EU, in fact, there has been more help coming in from Brussels than from Lisbon.

true,adamkex,SWED,Hungarian in disguise,"&gt; Not necessarily. In the cases of parallel societies they keep their foreign culture and often become troublesome for society. This is especially visible in Denmark.

The ghettos that exist are caused by failed policies regarding integration. As far as I have understood Denmark has decreased immigration yet ghettos are still not gone. Please correct me if I am wrong. Poverty plays a big role in crime, refugees who come here usually have nothing. Society has failed them by not providing a job and help to understand how western societies work. It's a huge change when you are coming from a country where your government can absolutely never be trusted. Do you actually believe that your policies are not enacted it would lead to national instability? Foreign culture is not bad culture. As long as they follow the law and mind their own business there is nothing wrong.

&gt; Is needed? Perhaps not, I am not psychic. Would be very beneficial? Certainly.

&gt; The problem with immigrants (generally from other cultural sphere) is that they come to your nation with an entirely different world view. Assimilation is a way to condition and help them be a productive member of society. And just to clarify - this is not forced assimilation - you are free to piss the hell off if you do not want to live there, forced would apply that you cannot do that. I'm okay with that you do not care if people assimilate, but some of us do care about the well being of our nation.

If I need to assimilate to stay in Denmark then it is forced. Why are you so scared of different nationalities? Why can't you just leave people alone?

&gt; What I was trying to put out there was that there is no such thing as ultimate freedom without anarchy. You have to set the line somewhere, and the line is often put somewhere if it is harmful to the collective. Non-assimilating people are harmful to the collective. And minorities are fine, if they hold cultural or historical value, but minorities for the sake of it? No. That's just silly.

Do you have data that people who are not assimilated are harmful to the collective? It's absurd to think people from other cultures are a threat. Why do you think you have the right to tell other people to what culture to be?

&gt; How am I hostile? I am asking them to contribute if they want to live here. In what universe is that hostile? That's not hostility, that is asking for common bloody decency. All I am hearing is a lot of: 'but I dun wanna!' Fine. You don't want to contribute to society, go live in your own damn mudhole, but if you want to stay in our mudhole you have to play by our rules and conform to our muddy standards. We're not asking a lot, we're just saying don't run about naked in our mudhole and don't throw mud at other people.

&gt; You seem to think that by assimilation I mean large re-education centres guarded by military patrols and with extreme propaganda, but that is entirely not the case. I don't want them to eat propaganda, I want them to be educated. I want them to be able to defend themselves and their children perhaps against crazed extremism, I want them to be able to help their children in school - and many can't because they do not understand Danish, and I want them to live a peaceful normal life. And I want society to think well of them, to welcome them. Our current integration system is weak, flawed and has a complete and utter lack of assimilation because apparently it is a 'taboo' word and method. I think it is time we faced reality: Integration doesn't work. And in a decision of having to choose between assimilation and a complete stop to immigration, I would rather pick assimilation.

***I already said that the immigrant follows the law and pays tax.*** Assimilation is not what you described right now. What you described now is integration. What you want is better integration. You can have your own culture with everything you just described. A Muslim from Lebanon can still have democratic values, function in society, living a normal life, learn Danish and stay Lebanese. Assimilation is when the person becomes completely Danish and have no Lebanese customs what so ever. My best friend holds an English passport and but he spent most of his life in Sudan. Right now he is working in the UK. He will never be assimilated but he has never broken the law, speaks fluent English, has democratic values and is a lot more liberal than me and likely more liberal than you. He contributes to society. Should he assimilate? He is fully ""integrated"".

&gt; I'm not condoning Nazism or Communism, but extremist Islam for example is obviously not Danish. It is a Middle-Eastern influence, and we can combat that through assimilation. But we don't so the problem persists. Nazism is a lot more difficult to swat, same with Communism. Luckily we don't have any people with actual power (or violent tendencies) that go about that these days. As with everything I think the cure (also for extremist Islam) is simply to educate people.

Nobody wants extremist Islam. In fact all Muslims I know hate the extremists. Some of them don't even consider these people to be real Muslims. Freedom of religion exists in Denmark. You can't demand a person to drop his or her own religion without removing freedom of religion. It's undanish to demand that as long as freedom of religion is a Danish value. In Sweden there are both nazi (or borderline nazi) and communist marches. These people clash and if there would be no police interference there would be casualties and serious injuries. Cure for any extremism is education, at least for over 99% of the people. In Sweden [this party](http://i.imgur.com/BJ2l5.jpg) is in parliament right now. They say they have changed a lot from when this was printed in 1994 but I have no doubts there are still these types of people in that party. Also there is an ""ex-communist"" party in parliament. If the left wins the next election in Sweden then there is a good chance there will be ""ex-communists"" in government.

&gt; You will probably find it discriminatory, but it is still the truth: Different cultural spheres. French and Danish is very close compared to Danish and Iranian. Aside of that then we have obligations by being part of the EU.

I meant from a social perspective in society and not legal. It shouldn't matter where one's SO comes from. Obviously since there are a couple they have learned and accepted each other's culture.

&gt; Would it? I don't know. Perhaps. Maybe not. Don't get me wrong, I would love if we could just make the entire world sparkly and good, but reality is that the world is a dark place filled with violence, chaos and corruption. If you simply open for the flood without building yourself a proper boat to ride the wave then you're going to drown in it. It think that the mere fact we let some through is saintlike of us, sure, but I don't give my money to any charity, let alone all my money. It has to be controlled. The people that seek refuge here most learn that freedom and obligation is a two way street. You do not gain privilege without gaining duty.

I never said to open all borders. I just said the world would be a better place if we could help some people who face death. Even if it is just a little spread over rich countries. We don't need to close our borders even more.

&gt; No, but why does it matter? The age of imperialism is long gone and its every living proponent dead and buried.

Because some countries would be better off if they were not colonized. Imperialist countries would have been poorer today if they had never colonized. The effects of colonization are still visible today.

&gt; Good for you. The law allows that, but then you are not an immigrant. You are a citizen of X working in Y. You can't vote and thus cannot govern. I have no problem with that.

true,MeteorPhoenix,PUER,Puerto Rico,"&gt; This is true. However, I would note that withdrawing recognition is relatively rare, and has only ever really occurred in any significant way with Taiwan once countries began normalizing relations with the PRC due to economic opportunity. So, in that sense, I don't think the trend you are noticing is particularly unusual.

But then it's a matter of attrition. At some point, there will be the necessary 2/3rds to upgrade Kosovo. And, agree with them or not, Kosovars are absolutely winning the PR battle.

&gt; See, this presumes two things. First, that it is at all realistic that Serbia would ever obtain full EU member status.

Why do you think it isn't? They're damn close.

&gt; And second that it would be sufficiently advantaged by this to outweigh the many clear negatives of membership. I don't believe either of those hold true. Western Europe's influence on Serbia has been toxic, and I think slowly the Serbs are realizing this fact, which is why even though their government is not hostile to the EU (yet), they elected the most nationalistic one in their history the last time voters turned out.

Perhaps. This is dependent on what the Serbian people want, naturally. Do you think Serbia is better off outside of the EU, especially as every singe other former Yugoslav country is either inside, joining or negotiating to join? If so (and while I have my opinion, I don't presume to know), then by all means they should withdraw their application.

I *will* say that if there's one thing the EU is good at, it's forcing countries in it to adhere to some democratic standards. Many Eastern European countries joined it for that very reason; to anchor their fledging democracies to an institution that would force them to them.

At the very least, the government thinks EU membership is preferable.

&gt; Mind you, all of this is somewhat immaterial, in the sense that wars tend to alter borders. If a war is started, and not necessarily by Serbia, why would we not expect them to take additional land instead of preserving the current, unfavorable status quo?

Because they'll be treated like Israel, but without US' backing; an occupying bully.

I can't see a way in which there woudn't be an intervention if Serbia is the aggressor.

&gt; Admittedly, therein lies the risk. If the rest of the world would mind their own damn business, Kosovo would remain an uncontested by unruly part of Serbia. Should a war break out, history suggests that the Western powers will involve themselves, and do nothing but harm the Serbs and empower their enemies. So certainly what you suggest presents a real risk. But we would be well served to remember that war might well break out in the region without any Serbian aggression, and once it does, the Serbs have every right to take territory defensively.

If Kosovo attacks? Serbs absolutely have the right to defend themselves. Keep in mind, though, that Israel also defended themselves from the wars that gave them the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and it is *still* illegal to occupy them.

You mentioned Kosovo being Israel's Jerusalem early on, and you're right. But Jerusalem is Israel's Jerusalem, and Palestine absolutely demolished them in the PR war. They have no allies except reluctant support from the US government, and no Plan B if/when they lose that. They have lost almost every single other primary ally, and are subject to constant terrorist attacks. They now feels a bit how Serbs must feel; betrayed, isolated, nationalistic, angry at the world for not seeing how right they are.

The world would agree if it seemed as if Israelis were showing Palestinians even a modicum of respect. This, by the way, is the same perception the rest of the world has of Serbs when they talk about Kosovars.",0,1357754173,null,0,false,0,c7twpcz,t3_167jqt,t1_c7twpcz,t1_c7tub44,null,1430906832,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

When you threw down the ad hominem gauntlet with your bit about capitalists destroying ""the fucking planet"" you forfeited your right to whine about future ad hominems. 

&gt;You did when you implied I was lying about wages contracts being coercive and delivered under duress.

The practice of private property has nothing to do with whether the contract was made under duress, a statement you've weaseled out of substantiating for hours now.

&gt;No, it's the employment contract itself which is coercive.

How so? The worker isn't forced to agree to it by the business or the government.

&gt;No more absurd than anyone else who has doubtless argued this point to you many times.

You have promise, I think you can take the art to new levels.

&gt;By seizing their land/enclosing the commons, restricting the mobility of people/internal passports/settlement legislation, combination acts/busting unions, reducing the alternative options, regulating the fuck out of self or commonly owned businesses (or even saying they are unowned and seizing them too like the TSB under Thatcher), massively subsidising transnationals and allowing them to write legislation both at national and supra-national levels (ALEC, IMF, World Bank, Workfare UK), enforcing tariffs, intellectual property and limited liability, bailing out private businesses with public money, etc. This is a very very long list and I'm just vaguely dipping into it from drunken memory now.

None of this qualifies as coercing someone to work for a wage other than that which they agree to. Just admit you're lying, it'll save wear and tear on your keyboard. 

Like it or not, the worker-employer relationship is voluntary. You can argue it should be changed, but to pretend that this economic framework (which virtually nobody wants) should be extended back in time and that retroactive, unlimited liability should exist for the employer for wages that you just invented is insane for a number of reasons:

* It constitutes *ex post facto* punishment of the employer. 
* It would immediately destroy all businesses, wrecking the economies of the countries doing it.
* Once all those businesses were wrecked, the GDP of the country would plunge and everyone would become much poorer, despite the initial cash grab and spending orgy.
* All outside investment in the country in question would cease, leaving it in that depressed, impoverished position

The country was relatively prosperous and its leaders believed the gypsy problem is merely social.  They did believe that if they provide them with jobs and their children will have to attend schools everything will eventually turn to better.


For nearly 40 years gypsies had to work (it was against the law not to) and jobs were plentiful. Manual jobs they usually held were paid much better than, for example, teachers or technicians, so they were better off then most.


The children had to go to schools, otherwise children benefits were cut down. All education was free of charge and gypsy children studying at higher levels were especially supported by the state.


Gypsies were intentionally provided with new flats in city centers among the native population, to support their integration. 


It failed, in every respect. Gypsies preferred jobs without supervision and their work morale was low (even for the era). In spite of relatively high salaries they didn't develop middle class culture. Their children often failed up to show in schools and the parents didn't value education at all. Most kids thus weren't able to finish primary education. Integration attempts failed too   - they lived next to the natives but kept no contact with them.  Violent crime was then very low, with just one significant exception - gypsies.


During the same period very poor rural areas got on the same social level as cities, higher education became universal and criminality was almost unheard of.

true,DogBotherer,BKFG,Anarchist,"&gt;When you threw down the ad hominem gauntlet with your bit about capitalists destroying ""the fucking planet"" you forfeited your right to whine about future ad hominems. 

You clearly don't understand what an a hominem argument is.

&gt;The practice of private property has nothing to do with whether the contract was made under duress, a statement you've weaseled out of substantiating for hours now.

You obviously don't understand basic economics or psychology either.  I haven't weaselled out of anything, you've just chosen to ignore my answers because you don't like them.

&gt;How so? The worker isn't forced to agree to it by the business or the government.

Capitalists and government have historically conspired to ensure that wage labour is the only viable option for most people.  Few people with land and food would take the kind of crap most unlanded, one-week-from-starving (or less) workers will take today.  If you don't believe this, I challenge you to look with an open mind at the historical record and the reasons why legislation was passed in centuries past.  I can provide you with chapter and verse if I must, but I'd really rather you did some research yourself (look for example at some of the Acts aimed at preventing transient workers, labour combination, productive use of the commons, at forcing enclosures, at forfeiture of common and unregistered titles, against free movement of labour, at seizing the families of the poor for slave labour.  That's where it starts, and just to give you a launch point, you could start [here](http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/the-subsidy-of-history/#axzz2HVP1sIfg).

&gt;Like it or not, the worker-employer relationship is voluntary.

Only for a bizarre and frankly wankish definition of ""voluntary "" which only rightist pseudo ""libertarians"" could possibly subscribe to, where we all live in an economic and historical vacuum, and only someone physically holding a gun to your head could be coercive.  I'll give you a hint, when the robber holds the gun, the man (or woman) holding the swag bag is a robber too, and the fact that you ""voluntarily"" drop your goodies into it doesn't mean s/he's any less a robber.

&gt;what happened in every country that underwent a socialist revolution. 100 million people died and many more were malnourished during the last century learning this the hard way. Do you really need to learn this lesson again?

And capitalism has killed between a conservative 100 million over the course of the last century to about 2 billion over the course of its history, depending on whose figures you believe.  So?  Which is worse?

ISPs largely don't even provide the cross-country infrastructure, and speed and latency between, say, any IXP in Hamburg and any IXP in Amsterdam can easily be better than that to any other German city that isn't Berlin, Munich or Frankfurt.

Large ISPs, though, especially those that are successors of national telekoms, are notorious for still having their old centralised infrastructure, routing most of their traffic through it, and thus having worse service than what the network of IXPs could provide them with.

Breaking with the IXP model would mean total fallout. People could actually control, physically, network access: Right now, when you want to start up an ISP in your city, all you need is money, the consumer lines (which may be easy if you're the local utility), and a fat pipe to the next IXP.

As for the Os Maias. I hated it at my first contact. For the first half of the book I just found it a dreadfully boring nineteen century soap opera, even though I acknowledged it was a good book. It gains a lot when you start seeing the symbolism and social critique. That being said, I don't particularly like it. Studying it is far more interesting than reading it imho. I love Eça's writting. But Os Maias was not one of my favorite reads, even though it was important culturally and I loved studying it. 

Also, this four authors (Camões, Saramago, Eça, Pessoa) are the most mentioned portuguese literature authors in foreign sources (english wikipedia pages for example) which says something.

I didn't actually read any Torga book for school, I picked them up and just loved them.

So I didn't pick this authors because of the curriculum. But the curriculum and I picked them because they are great and structural to portuguese culture.

In the 19th century, the most famous author is probably Multatuli, which is a pseudonym of E. Douwes Dekker. He wrote a very important book about the mistreatment of the people in the Dutch East Indies. It’s  called Max Havelaar, which is now also the name of a fair trade brand. Another famous writer from the 19th century is Louis Couperus.

In the 20th century, which is probably the most relevant, there are a number of important books and writers. Some of them include: W.F. Hermans with De Donkere Kamer van Damokles (and Nooit Meer Slapen); Gerard Reve with De Avonden; and Harry Mulisch with De Ontdekking van de Hemel (the Discovery of Heaven) and Het Proces.

Another very famous writer who wrote in Dutch is Willem Elsschot, but he’s Belgian.

In the 21st century, arguably the most famous writer is Arnon Grunberg, but I can’t even think of a book he wrote.

If I had to say which is the most important book? Probably Max Havelaar, because it literally changed the way we perceived the people in the East Indies.",0,1357763106,null,0,1357766700,0,c7tzqm7,t3_169gbi,t1_c7tzqm7,t3_169gbi,null,1430908234,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

What the pro-European stance needs is federalists who argue for a clear division of power that neither the EU or the state governments can violate. As of now it's a one ended deal and this is what is causing most of the outrage. Also we can never have a true democraticly elected government for the EU if we don't move towards a federal state structure. You can't remake political institutions in the EU unless they have actual powers.

true,Ozires,FINL,Finland,"Hey French person talking about languages! I'd like to ask you something. What are your views on continuing to have French as the language for the European Court of Justice? We talk about this often at our lawschool. It's really a problem for many people since so few people are fluent enough in legal French to be able to take up positions or even entertain the thought of in the future applying to the ECJ.. And this isn't limited to just Finland. If the official language were changed to English, it would not only create a lot of interest for legal minds all over Europe to pursue a career path in Union law, but stop so strictly limiting the applicants for European positions. The best and brightest legal minds in Europe aren't always the ones who took French in elementary school, and even that isn't at all enough to be able to write and speak legal french fluently. And a bigger problem is that with such a small pool applicants, the private side is able to tempt the best french-fluent jurists with much better offers than hte EU institutions can.

This has been an impossible issue for the French government in past decades and I understand that it's tied up with all sorts of power issues between France and Germany (and the UK). But I'd just like to know, what would you think or do you have any feeling as to what the average French person would think about changing the ECJ language to English? French is a beautiful language and it's very well suited for the legal theorizing that is required, but the fact still stands that so few know it well enough to be able to function with it, and in a lot of cases it leaves the EU with the second best, and sometimes not even that. Maybe there's some sort of a concession we could give to France if you guys give this up. Maybe we could build a monument for French supremacy in Berlin and London or maybe just put the EU Parliament in Strasbourg permanently.

Our job market is shit. No jokes about it. Most of the people I grew up with are either working in Norway (over 70k people there now) or got a job in Stockholm (through contacts). The old generation isn't opening up any positions if they can hold on to them. I don't blame them either, the state pensions are going to be fucked soon thanks to our irresponsible immigration politics. 

The Government also pretends to give a shit about skilled immigrant workers yet doesn't give much help for employers who want to hire them. Asylum seekers meanwhile get downright Affirmative Action jobs with a large part of their check paid with tax money but are considered by many employers to be a liability due to our rigorous unionization. Basically if they get a shit-employee they can be screwed over pretty hard as it is still hard to fire fuckups. There's trial periods but that's still lost money in economically hard times when there's a lot of companies going bankrupt despite our supposed growth.

Perhaps you don't? It's an attack on the person. You insulted my ""sort"" with your bit on the environment, and I've been doing the same by comparing you to a slaver.

&gt;You obviously don't understand basic economics or psychology either. I haven't weaselled out of anything, you've just chosen to ignore my answers because you don't like them.

No, your answers have failed to point to any instance of the coercion you initially claimed.

&gt;Capitalists and government have historically conspired to ensure that wage labour is the only viable option for most people.

And so now we get into conspiracy theory territory...

&gt;Few people with land and food would take the kind of crap most unlanded, one-week-from-starving (or less) workers will take today.

""Taking crap"" is not being coerced. Any of those workers could save money and buy land, obtaining the existence you claim is denied to them. 

&gt;If you don't believe this, I challenge you to look with an open mind at the historical record and the reasons why legislation was passed in centuries past. I can provide you with chapter and verse if I must, but I'd really rather you did some research yourself (look for example at some of the Acts aimed at preventing transient workers, labour combination, productive use of the commons, at forcing enclosures, at forfeiture of common and unregistered titles, against free movement of labour, at seizing the families of the poor for slave labour.

None of that is in effect or relevant today. This isn't England at the dawn of the industrial revolution.

&gt;Only for a bizarre and frankly wankish definition of ""voluntary ""

How is it bizarre? The employee is free to quit at any time. His continued employment is voluntary, both on his part and on the part of his employer. 

&gt;which only rightist pseudo ""libertarians"" could possibly subscribe to, where we all live in an economic and historical vacuum, and only someone physically holding a gun to your head could be coercive.

It's quite a bit more straightforward and logical than your definition, which is so broad it has no meaning.

&gt; I'll give you a hint, when the robber holds the gun, the man (or woman) holding the swag bag is a robber too, and the fact that you ""voluntarily"" drop your goodies into it doesn't mean s/he's any less a robber.

What the fuck are you babbling on about? If my employer doesn't treat me right, I quit. There is no gun, and there is no coercion in my continued employment. The employer needs employees just as much as employees need employers.

&gt;And capitalism has killed between a conservative 100 million over the course of the last century to about 2 billion over the course of its history, depending on whose figures you believe. So? Which is worse?

Which is worse? The system that a child could see would lead to widespread poverty and famine: socialism. By the way, the 100 million figure for capitalism was formed in response to the initial estimate of socialism's death toll and the numbers backing it up are suspect, to say the least, usually involving events only slightly connected with capitalism.

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;The ghettos that exist are caused by failed policies regarding integration. As far as I have understood Denmark has decreased immigration yet ghettos are still not gone. Please correct me if I am wrong. Poverty plays a big role in crime, refugees who come here usually have nothing. Society has failed them by not providing a job and help to understand how western societies work. It's a huge change when you are coming from a country where your government can absolutely never be trusted. Do you actually believe that your policies are not enacted it would lead to national instability? Foreign culture is not bad culture. As long as they follow the law and mind their own business there is nothing wrong.

Sometimes foreign culture *is* a bad culture, I'm sorry to break it to you. Sometimes you have to civilize them.

That aside then yes, poverty plays a part, but so does a complete lack of assimilation. Who would want to hire someone that cannot even speak the language properly, someone who do not know the law and/or someone that by his/her mere affiliation with problem people cause damage to the image of the business? I know it is harsh, but that is reality. People would want someone who has a higher chance of not becoming a problem. 

And yes ghettos are not gone because they are built upon the poor foundation of past integration, not current integration.

&gt;If I need to assimilate to stay in Denmark then it is forced. 

No. You are free to leave. It is not forced at all. Assimilation would be a condition for you to be a Danish citizen.

&gt;Why are you so scared of different nationalities? Why can't you just leave people alone?

I'm not scared, but if you want to stay my house, you play by our rules and conform to our standards. Why should we freely let people walk into our house and destroy everything? Try to change our rules? To essentially squat on our living space?

&gt;Do you have data that people who are not assimilated are harmful to the collective? It's absurd to think people from other cultures are a threat. Why do you think you have the right to tell other people to what culture to be?

Why? Because they wish to live in our nation perhaps? Why is that so difficult to wrap your head around? Now, they harm society by making parallel society. I think we have been past that, if not then feel free to read up on what parallel societies actually does to the entire society.

&gt;I already said that the immigrant follows the law and pays tax. 

I don't view that as some kind of quality. It's merely part of your duty.

&gt;Assimilation is not what you described right now. What you described now is integration.

No it is not, actually. Integration is a haphazard attempt at assimilation while panicky trying to deny that it is assimilation, because people are so afraid of seeming xenophobic. Oh no, he wants to guard the border - he must be a *Nazi*. That is the kind of idiots that pushed us into this very poor excuse of assimilation we got right now. They have turned the notion of assimilation in this extreme notion as some form of concentration camp where you drill people with propaganda and put a chip in their brain - which is of course preposterous. Assimilation is the process of incorporating something wholly into society. To bring about conformity.

&gt;What you want is better integration. 

Which is assimilation.

&gt;You can have your own culture with everything you just described. A Muslim from Lebanon can still have democratic values, function in society, living a normal life, learn Danish and stay Lebanese. Assimilation is when the person becomes completely Danish and have no Lebanese customs what so ever. 

No it is not. That is the crazy multiculturalist view of assimilation, and it is plainly wrong. It is fearmongering, nothing else. 

&gt;My best friend holds an English passport and but he spent most of his life in Sudan. Right now he is working in the UK. He will never be assimilated but he has never broken the law, speaks fluent English, has democratic values and is a lot more liberal than me and likely more liberal than you. He contributes to society. Should he assimilate? He is fully ""integrated"".

I don't know, where is his citizenship?

&gt;Nobody wants extremist Islam. In fact all Muslims I know hate the extremists. Some of them don't even consider these people to be real Muslims. 

No, but frankly other believers enable their extremist fellows. That aside, then a believer is far more likely to be turned into a fanatic. And *yes* that is exactly how it happens.

&gt;Freedom of religion exists in Denmark. You can't demand a person to drop his or her own religion without removing freedom of religion.

You assume I am pro freedom of religion - I am not. I believe a stricter control over superstition would be good, that way you can ensure that it benefits society and direct the crazy in more benign directions.

&gt;It's undanish to demand that as long as freedom of religion is a Danish value.

It is not a Danish value. We have a state religion.

&gt;In Sweden there are both nazi (or borderline nazi) and communist marches. These people clash and if there would be no police interference there would be casualties and serious injuries. 

There are nazis and communists in Denmark too, does not mean they go and bomb embassies or go nuts because of a drawing. They're pretty chill actually. It's the anarchists you want to look out for.

&gt;Cure for any extremism is education, at least for over 99% of the people. In Sweden this party is in parliament right now. They say they have changed a lot from when this was printed in 1994 but I have no doubts there are still these types of people in that party. Also there is an ""ex-communist"" party in parliament. If the left wins the next election in Sweden then there is a good chance there will be ""ex-communists"" in government.
We agree then.

&gt;I meant from a social perspective in society and not legal. It shouldn't matter where one's SO comes from. Obviously since there are a couple they have learned and accepted each other's culture.

The two are intertwined however. When you ask why French and no Persian, should I not answer you why when there are very obvious reasons for it being so? I'm not saying their love isn't all kinds of real and frankly I don't much care. What is important is that comparatively speaking then Iranian and Danish are *very* different and it would be best both for the SO and society to assimilate if he/she is to live here. Compared to someone who is French there is a smaller gap in differences to close. Languages are closer for one, and so are the social and justice system. Even our way of thinking is closer. It's because Danish/French and Iranian lies in two different cultural spheres.

&gt;I never said to open all borders. I just said the world would be a better place if we could help some people who face death. Even if it is just a little spread over rich countries. We don't need to close our borders even more.

No, but we have to deal with the immigrants somehow. We can't just let them in unconditionally.

&gt;Because some countries would be better off if they were not colonized. Imperialist countries would have been poorer today if they had never colonized. The effects of colonization are still visible today.

Let me rephrase that. How is it relevant?

&gt;Do you know what an immigrant is? It is a person who moved to another country to settle, most of the times permanently. Nothing more and nothing else. Not all immigrants want citizenship.

After that, the co-conspirators can exit the train, the meme has been planted, it will replicate itself without further aid until grayface, in the guise of the transport authority, will come in and remove the swing.

Solon, considered a wise lawmaker, introduced the concept of [seisactheia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seisachtheia). I'm guessing that some people will draw metaphorical parallels.

&gt; Under the pre-existing legal status, according to the account of the Constitution of the Athenians attributed to Aristotle, debtors unable to repay their creditors would surrender their land to them, then becoming hektemoroi, i.e. serfs who cultivated what used to be their own land and gave one sixth of produce to their creditors.

&gt; Should the debt exceed the perceived value of debtor's total assets, then the debtor and his family would become the creditor's slaves as well. The same would result if a man defaulted on a debt whose collateral was the debtor's personal freedom.

&gt; **Seisachtheia reforms**

&gt; The seisachtheia laws immediately cancelled all outstanding debts, retroactively emancipated all previously enslaved debtors, reinstated all confiscated serf property to the hektemoroi, and forbade the use of personal freedom as collateral in all future debts. The laws instituted a ceiling to maximum property size - regardless of the legality of its acquisition (i.e. by marriage), meant to prevent excessive accumulation of land by powerful families.

To those that don't know, it's an epic poem consisting of 10,000 lines (about 400 pages as a book) of 15-syllable rhyming couplets of poetry. The story is so beautifully written by the poet; his skill as a poet is masterful, to be able to narrate an epic romance with such a rigid structure and still express deep sentiments expressed within the story. 

I remember one section where the main character asks his best friend for advice on what do do about his affection for the heroine (the Emperor's daughter)...His friend likens his passion for her to a tree which has been allowed to grow within his heart and poison him with harmful leaves and poisoned fruit, and filled with thorns from root to top. Symbolic things like that which are beautifully expressed in the special form of medieval Greek poetry, the 15-syllabe rhyming couplet. It's a masterpiece.

All in all, I think you have things to learn about Scandinavia, if you think we believe we're better than anyone at anything. Anyways, the French-German rivalry is seen here as mostly a benign joke though, so I did not expect to give insult by it, if I did, I apologize.

Here's a chapter from the ECJ's pages from wikipedia:
""The working language of the Court, however, including the language in which the judges deliberate and the language in which preliminary reports and judgments are drafted is French. This makes the ECJ, along with the General Court of the European Union, the only international court where French is the sole working language.""

I expect, if France (and the rest of the French speaking part of Europe) is going to give in about the forementioned, I do think they need some concession, why would anyone give up this much power in the EU for nothing? Personally I hope some sort of trade can be arranged, because the situation now isn't that great for anyone. This really is overall a strange situation. I'm not sure Germany would that much prefer English as a working language, for any other reason than France then not having it. The small countries with little influence, on the other hand would prefer it, because their education systems emphasize English so much more since you basically can't survive with any of our languages in today's world. And then if the UK leaves the EU we'll have a working language in our court that isn't really the language of any major European country (there's of course Ireland, but still) which would be a rather embarrassing situation for all Europe. 

Anyways, I'd settle for dual French-English and the stacks of paperwork it generates, that's probably as much as is in any way realistic to hope for.

*The shadow increases in size and the camera zooms out further and further to the most dramatic part of the music, showing first sweden, then all of Europe at night time. The lights of cities disappear, like in that part of Call of Duty where a nuke got set off in space. This scene is interrupted by explosions and people getting thrown through the air.*

On a more serious note. Look, I get where you are coming from, but perhaps you are willing to entertain a different perspective. Unlike European countries where your birth country is often your ethnicity and the lines of your ancestors can be traced back to that land, Americans don't have that. There is no such thing as an American ethnicity (besides the Native Americans), hardly any sense of American ancestory. Where I am born only goes back three generations. Half of my family line can trace its roots back to Ireland (both of my grandmothers are 100% Irish). It is the dominate make up of my ancestory because the other portions are quarters and eighths. So in America, when we ask each other what is your ancestory we usually respond with the dominate make up (i.e. german, italian, *irish*...). That is literally the only connection we have with our heritage. That's it. Every other link is long gone. Why do you want to shit all over us for that? I've never heard of Italians making up names for Italian Americans, and stripping them of the right to want to identify with their heritafe. As far as I know, the Germans and Poles and every other European country aren't so snobbish about it either (or if they are, they conceal it better).

Think of this another way. Over the course of a century, several million Irish left for America. They took a gamble. There are only 4.5 million Irish left in Ireland. But because of these gamblers, there are now over 36 million people of Irish descent in America! That's basically an 8 to 1 payoff. Because of that there is a thriving Irish bloodline on the opposite side of the planet. I am sure many of the Irish immigrants who came to America would be happy to know that their gamble paid off so mightily.

So what if some Americans say they are Irish. So what if they are trying to keep alive the only sense of identity they have that isn't the meaningless ""American"". Are the Irish that cynical that they can't let some people *try* and keep some memory of their heritage alive? Really? That bothers me.

The alternative of course isn't isolation, and the question really shouldn't be about isolation, it should be about the relationship that we have with the EU and within it. 

Now, the UK's single largest export market is the US (and the UK runs a trade surplus with the US), but that is dwarfed by EU trade, in fact the UK does more trade with Germany.

But again, trade is only one factor and it shouldn't be the sole determining factor when talking about a relationship that does involve (regardless of how you redesign the union) some level of political cooperation and (assuming a total withdrawal from the EU) bilateral treaties will be necessary.

true,adamkex,SWED,Hungarian in disguise,"&gt; Sometimes foreign culture is a bad culture, I'm sorry to break it to you. Sometimes you have to civilize them.
That aside then yes, poverty plays a part, but so does a complete lack of assimilation. Who would want to hire someone that cannot even speak the language properly, someone who do not know the law and/or someone that by his/her mere affiliation with problem people cause damage to the image of the business? I know it is harsh, but that is reality. People would want someone who has a higher chance of not becoming a problem.
And yes ghettos are not gone because they are built upon the poor foundation of past integration, not current integration.

Some indigenous culture is bad. Like binge drinking. Learning the indigenous language != assimilation. It is important to learn the indigenous language. Have the current integration laws at least improved the ghettos? Has limited immigration shown an improvement among the immigrants who are already here? Ghettos can be caused by many different things. Like **poverty**.

&gt; No. You are free to leave. It is not forced at all. Assimilation would be a condition for you to be a Danish citizen.

You don't understand what forced is. That is a typical Scandinavian answer, just leave people alone, let people be. Also I don't know why you keep rambling about citizenship. I have hardly spoken about it.

&gt; Why? Because they wish to live in our nation perhaps? Why is that so difficult to wrap your head around? Now, they harm society by making parallel society. I think we have been past that, if not then feel free to read up on what parallel societies actually does to the entire society.

No data, just as expected. Do you have evidence on how parallel societies are formed? And the socio-economic reasons behind it? ""They do this"" is a crap argument, look into the reasoning why this happens. Poverty seems to be one likely factor. Unemployment another.

&gt; I don't view that as some kind of quality. It's merely part of your duty.

This is the ""duty"". And learning the language. By having a job it benefits the nation by tax. The immigrant helps society even more if this a job which need more people but there aren't enough Danes to take the job (or willing).

&gt; No it is not. That is the crazy multiculturalist view of assimilation, and it is plainly wrong. It is fearmongering, nothing else.

No. You are wrong. Assimilation is when a person drops his or her own culture in favor of the native one. If anyone is fearmongering then it is you. I don't care what religious beliefs other people have. As long as they follow the law and contribute to society I don't care. You are obsessed with parallel societies and are scared that immigrants will decrease the stability of Denmark.

&gt; No it is not, actually. Integration is a haphazard attempt at assimilation while panicky trying to deny that it is assimilation, because people are so afraid of seeming xenophobic. Oh no, he wants to guard the border - he must be a Nazi. That is the kind of idiots that pushed us into this very poor excuse of assimilation we got right now. They have turned the notion of assimilation in this extreme notion as some form of concentration camp where you drill people with propaganda and put a chip in their brain - which is of course preposterous. Assimilation is the process of incorporating something wholly into society. To bring about conformity.

Assimilation is to drop one own's culture in favor of the native one. This is not required. As long as the person functions in society like any other person there is no problem. I didn't call you a Nazi, I doubt that you heil in your freetime. However from what you've told me you seem to be some kind of fascist because of your authoritarian view of society and that culture is the most important thing by far when it comes to integration. You seem to be completely against freedom and think that your way is the only way. Why do you have so much faith in your government?

&gt; I'm not scared, but if you want to stay my house, you play by our rules and conform to our standards. Why should we freely let people walk into our house and destroy everything? Try to change our rules? To essentially squat on our living space?

Your standards are freedom of religion and freedom of speech. It's in your constitution. If anyone is altering your laws then it is Danish politicians. You are scared. If you weren't then you'd never have this opinion.

&gt; I don't know, where is his citizenship?

Born in the UK. Do you think his citizenship should be stripped off him? That's just absurd. He is contributing a lot more to society than many other people in the UK. If you think people like him are some kind if threat then you are scared and paranoid.

&gt; You assume I am pro freedom of religion - I am not. I believe a stricter control over superstition would be good, that way you can ensure that it benefits society and direct the crazy in more benign directions.

I assumed that everybody in this subreddit was for religious freedom. I guess I made an ass of myself (ass u me). We clearly disagree on this question. I don't believe the state should care what religion its citizens and inhabitants follow. The state should interfere with my life as little as possible. I want to have the right to convert to any religion I want, even if it is not my intention. Why should the government decide what is right or wrong? What if it disagrees with a value the majority of the Danes have? Are you going to be spoonfed what your government is telling you? The government should organize society, not tell me what to think.

&gt; It is not a Danish value. We have a state religion.

Just cause there is an official religion doesn't mean that there is freedom of religion. It's in the constitution §67. You should know that your country has freedom of religion. You must be undanish to be against it. You should be embarrassed by making such an absurd claim.

&gt; Which is assimilation.

No. This is integration.

&gt; There are nazis and communists in Denmark too, does not mean they go and bomb embassies or go nuts because of a drawing. They're pretty chill actually. It's the anarchists you want to look out for.

I don't know the situation in Denmark. In Sweden communists and the far-right try to clash with each other. I haven't heard of any violent anarchists here. The Muslims I know thought those drawings were insulting and of bad taste, then they stopped caring and pitied the person who drew them because of his ignorance. Not all Muslims are violent like you seem to believe.

&gt; No, but frankly other believers enable their extremist fellows. That aside, then a believer is far more likely to be turned into a fanatic. And yes that is exactly how it happens.

Ignorance leads to extremism. Intolerance leads to extremism. Fanatics exist everywhere. It's more likely that a left wing person turns into a communist than centrist or liberal. It's more likely a nationalist becomes violent because of his intolerance to different people.

&gt; The two are intertwined however. When you ask why French and no Persian, should I not answer you why when there are very obvious reasons for it being so? I'm not saying their love isn't all kinds of real and frankly I don't much care. What is important is that comparatively speaking then Iranian and Danish are very different and it would be best both for the SO and society to assimilate if he/she is to live here. Compared to someone who is French there is a smaller gap in differences to close. Languages are closer for one, and so are the social and justice system. Even our way of thinking is closer. It's because Danish/French and Iranian lies in two different cultural spheres.

In this case cultural differences don't really matter. Obviously there has to be ***integration*** so this person functions in society. The family will in the end be assimilated because the children will be identify themselves as Danish or part Danish. Even if one of the parents doesn't see as him or herself as Danish.

&gt; No, but we have to deal with the immigrants somehow. We can't just let them in unconditionally.

What? When have I ever said there shouldn't be conditions. They have to follow the law and live normally just like everybody else.

&gt; Let me rephrase that. How is it relevant?

It is relevant because the state of many poorer countries would be better if there was no colonialism. Some of these countries could be a democracy by now if they would have developed naturally on its own. This could lead to less extremism in the world and less refugees whom in your eyes seem to threaten society.

&gt; And you haven't truly settled if you do not have citizenship, thus these people are not immigrants.

Many of these people want to go back to their country of origin once it becomes a lot better place to live in, like not a brutal dictatorship which could execute them for being different or not a bombsite. Some of these people flee to countries to Denmark to be allowed to be different. You aren't much better than them if you tell them they have to become Danish to stay.

Fast-forward to the second half of the 19th century. Galician was long ago separated from Portuguese but it's now when many writers decide to write again in their own language. Rosalía de Castro with her *Cantares gallegos* and *Follas novas* is one of the most famous writers of this age.

true,Ozires,FINL,Finland,"It's a disturbing when it's put into text like that. And it's absolutely true. I'm not an immigrant and I can safely say this is exactly what happens if you're not white as snow and called Svensson or Virtanen. We're all racists. I try to be as open-minded and still you sometimes find it in yourself, and it's disgusting. I was renting out my flat a couple of years ago and I got calls from all sorts of people, one of them a somalian construction worker and trust me I did think 'oh god not him'. If I can say anything in my defense, it's that I thought the same about a young couple with a one-year-old, and in the end found the only suitable person to be a 70-year-old old guy who likes reading books and sleeping. What remains though, is that I would've probably rented it out to the white 70-year-old guy had I had an exactly similar black person there, if he hadn't had a great story or personality. When you're judging people based on nothing but some paper, a phone call or meeting them once, stereotypes rule and the stereotype about a somalian in Scandinavia isn't pleasant. Also, I'd say in my situation I thought a lot about what the friends and family of the person I was renting to might be like, so it wasn't just about the merits of the person. 

Still, this is totally wrong, unfair, racist and pretty much a stinking shitpile, yes we are racist and xenophobic. I think we're generally nice and well.. normal towards a black person if we meet them in person, but if it's just 'a black person' (insert anyone else from outside Western-Europe), we're just scared of them that's all. Western-Europe, we've gotten used to (not all but most), but cultures beyond that are just scary, they're unknown. You don't know how to act and they seem strange and you just spare yourself the trouble and pick the white guy, because it's easier that way. And the immigrants get the shaft. Sure, there's people who actually actively hate immigrants too, but that's not the cause of the general inequality you're facing. We still think about this place as folkhemmet or for us Finns the lintukoto, where in good and bad, the changes of the big world can't touch us. Really this place is like the Shire, so many people just don't want to know and want to be left alone. I don't even know if it can be changed. At some point it has to, because we can't shut the world out indefinitely. There's a real danger though, that an underclass of immigrants will form, which perpetuates the prejudice that they are only here to do things like cleaning. It's always a small victory when you see a black person in the media or as a professional, because people still respect that sort of thing a lot here, every little bit helps. The only thing that's going to change this is that hopefully the kids in school will intermingle a lot more and they grow up realizing there's not that big of a difference really. And that non-whites don't slaughter sheep and perform rituals or crazy shit like that.

Oh, and another thing. We pride ourselves in having no corruption, but here we just have a different type. Since so few people live here, people in certain fields get to know each other very well and basically get jobs by connections. If that's at all possible (probably redundant of me to suggest this), say via the friends you got while studying, you should try that, because really if people know you, they know the stereotype doesn't apply and that you're a nice fellow. Realistically the only other way to get past the paper barrier is to change your name or call the employer every time with questions and try to make a real good impression, so they'll remember you.

From the US perspective, the UK and US have BROADLY similar economic make ups and perspectives on economic issues. The UK is a major financial centre with free access to the EU market, and a business culture positive and receptive to that of the US. Politically we have similar aims (rightly or wrongly), and are usually seen to be in agreement on foreign policy issues. We share secret intelligence and have major defence links. 

The US doesn't have similarly deep links with another EU country. The French are mildly anti-US, more so since Iraq, and Europe as a whole are more socialist, economically protectionist, and less expeditionary in foreign policy. If the UK remains in the EU, there is a voice at the top table saying things that will usually be in line with what the US wants/needs/believes. And much as the press and politicians in the UK may play it otherwise, the UK IS at the EU top table; we have a hell of a lot of votes, money, economic clout and military capability. We aren't by any stretch a dominant force, and we don't always win the argument, but what we say at least gets listened to and considered. If we left, the US would lose that voice on their wavelength, and the EU would likely become a little more economically protectionist and a little more socialist, neither of which are directly in the US interest.

None of this means that it is necessarily in the British interest to remain in the EU. It just means that it is in the US interest that we do so. But this is a comment from a US government source, so of course that is perfectly sensible and understandable. It just needs to be seen in this context.

TL;DR? It isn't in US interests for the UK to leave the EU, but that doesn't mean that it isn't in UK interests to do so. ",0,1357776450,null,0,false,0,c7u4ab3,t3_169ary,t1_c7u4ab3,t1_c7tz2s8,null,1430910446,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Hmm, not sure that that works.  For one, I attacked _the ideology_ of capitalism  by saying it is in the process of destroying the planet (through addiction to growth, externalities, profit motive etc.), you associated me personally and directly with the autocratic leader of a State capitalist (socialist?) empire, whom I do not and have never claimed to support, be influenced by, have any respect for, etc. in an attempt to discredit my argument.

A conspiracy so transparent that even Adam Smith believed in it.

&gt;Any of those workers could save money and buy land, obtaining the existence you claim is denied to them. 

Right...of course.

&gt;None of that is in effect or relevant today. This isn't England at the dawn of the industrial revolution.

Of course it is, in many ways wealth is as concentrated as it's ever been, and often throughout that whole time period.  I'd have to look up the specific, but roughly half the land in the UK is owned by a few hundred thousand people, and a substantial part of that by a few families whose holdings have been extant since William the Conqueror.  In the US, the half dozen heirs of the Walton family own more wealth between them than the bottom 42% of Americans.

S/He's a little bit free to select his master, nothing more, s/he's still stuck in capitalist wage slavery.  And that's in a good economy.  Much of the time s/he's free to choose between his/her shitty job and unemployment.

&gt;The employer needs employees just as much as employees need employers.

Questo gioco è 

imprevedibile, 

e ti emoziona

sopra ogni limite

dai quattro angoli 

di tutto il mondo

tutti uniti inseguiamo il nostro sogno

La partita può farti

imprecare ed esultare 

ma si vede il mondo unito -free!-

e ti fa sballare!

ora non c'è niente che mi possa fermare

tutti in coro noi potremo cantare

Insieme!

Quando questa passione

è grande nel cuore

sbandiero al sole 

la voglia di libertà

---

Si può sorridere 

e disperarsi

per un gol fatto vedi dieci tiri scarsi (ha ha ha)

ma lo spettacolo 

è qui davanti

e non c'è squadra né vittoria siamo il mondo e siamo tanti!

---

Questa passione

è grande nel cuore

sbandiero al sole 

la voglia di libertà

---

Per la libertà 

e il successo

sbandierando

canto adesso

quanti colori 

sugli spalti

e ai campioni che abbiamo qua davanti

L'adrenalina sale, lungo la spina dorsale

mentre il terzino sale, lungo la fascia laterale 

dalla trequarti affonda, con un cross centrale

arriva la bomba, per il portiere -niente da fare!-
 
E' questo il super evento, il resto non fa testo.

questi 90 minuti, non esiste altra festa

Con quel sorriso sul volto, per quel globo d'oro tondo

sudi ogni secondo della coppa del mondo.

Sei lì per la tua squadra e il tuo inno ti gasa

e uno stadio colorato ora è la tua casa

con i tuoi compagni persi, questa festa è per noi

tutto il mondo oggi è intorno a nooooi!

Quando questa passione

è grande nel cuore

sbandiero al sole la voglia di libertà

Tuition fees are a tethered tax and one that is charged at a fixed rate for everyone above a certain income. A person that earns millions in income over their lifetime will pay the same as someone who is well off. There is no granularity. This is a textbook right wing form of taxation. The poor pay nothing but everyone else pays exactly the same.

By how much? 23% corp tax instead of 21%? This isn't a different policy from what the Conservatives are doing, it is nitpicking. 

Face it, we've still got New Labour and all their neoliberal bullshit. Just because they've changed the front man don't think for a minute that the party is any different.

&gt;State owned investment bank to invest in British infrastructure (Not relying on private firms for the lions share of investment)

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;Some indigenous culture is bad. Like binge drinking.

So? Does that mean we should accept the bad from immigrants?

&gt;Learning the indigenous language != assimilation. It is important to learn the indigenous language. 

Learning the indigenous language is a part of assimilation and the fact it is important does not make it any less so.

&gt;Have the current integration laws at least improved the ghettos? Has limited immigration shown an improvement among the immigrants who are already here? Ghettos can be caused by many different things. Like poverty.

The complete lack of proper assimilation has only made the ghetto problem grow. The moment you create a ghetto you also have to spend resources to mend it.

&gt;You don't understand what forced is. 

I understand it perfectly. You do not understand what a choice and its consequences is however.

&gt;That is a typical Scandinavian answer, just leave people alone, let people be. Also I don't know why you keep rambling about citizenship. I have hardly spoken about it.

Because citizenship is important and thinking that it is not in a discussion of immigration is frankly silly.

&gt;No data, just as expected. Do you have evidence on how parallel societies are formed? And the socio-economic reasons behind it? ""They do this"" is a crap argument, look into the reasoning why this happens. Poverty seems to be one likely factor. Unemployment another.

The reason I don't bring up data is because the information you request is trivial and only requires some searching. If you are uninformed, with the Internet, it is only your own fault. Yes poverty is a part of it, yes unemployment is partly the cause of that, and guess what is the cause of unemployment? Guess what cause people to band together in ghettoes? Use that brain evolution gave you.



&gt;This is the ""duty"". And learning the language. By having a job it benefits the nation by tax. The immigrant helps society even more if this a job which need more people but there aren't enough Danes to take the job (or willing).

You're just repeating what you already said. As I said: That is not a quality worthy of praise. That is simple duty. A quality worthy of scorn would be the opposite of what you wrote and a quality worthy of praise is assimilation. In other words what you wrote is not really a quality, it is the standard. What you are *expected* to do.

&gt;No. You are wrong. Assimilation is when a person drops his or her own culture in favor of the native one. 

No. It is conforming to a new culture. It does not necessitate a complete destruction of identity as you profess.

&gt;If anyone is fearmongering then it is you. I don't care what religious beliefs other people have. As long as they follow the law and contribute to society I don't care. You are obsessed with parallel societies and are scared that immigrants will decrease the stability of Denmark.

There is a difference to fearmongering and stating simple obvious truths.

&gt;Your standards are freedom of religion and freedom of speech. It's in your constitution. If anyone is altering your laws then it is Danish politicians. You are scared. If you weren't then you'd never have this opinion.

I'm not scared, I am sensible. There is a difference. Someday you might figure that out. And, I might add, our constitution is not a holy book. It never has been. It is dictated by the people. We have changed it several times already. We also have different laws than freedom of religion and freedom of speech (in case you did not know).

&gt;Born in the UK. Do you think his citizenship should be stripped off him? That's just absurd. He is contributing a lot more to society than many other people in the UK. If you think people like him are some kind if threat then you are scared and paranoid.

So, let me reiterate... We got a British guy from the UK who spend most of his time in Sudan and magically you think I wish to revoke his UK citizenship because he spends a lot of time in Sudan? What?

&gt;I assumed that everybody in this subreddit was for religious freedom. I guess I made an ass of myself (ass u me). We clearly disagree on this question.

Alright.

&gt;I don't believe the state should care what religion its citizens and inhabitants follow. The state should interfere with my life as little as possible. 

Then Scandinavia might not be the place for you to live. Our government is everywhere. It's one of the reasons why it is the best place on Earth to live.

What I am talking about however is not telling you what religion to believe in. You can have choices. Only the state will control these religions and what they preach. You can be a Muslim, but the Islam you will follow is a heavily modified one - one that suits our society. It would give all the good things religion can give, while probably avoiding most of the bad.

&gt;I want to have the right to convert to any religion I want, even if it is not my intention. Why should the government decide what is right or wrong? What if it disagrees with a value the majority of the Danes have? Are you going to be spoonfed what your government is telling you? The government should organize society, not tell me what to think.

Religion is a part of society, wish it or not. Why should the state no organize religion in a way that is benign to the rest of society? Take down all of the extremist churches and mosques and replace them with supervised moderate churches and mosques with a heavy humanist and philosophic influence. That would be preferable to letting madness run amok in society.

&gt;Just cause there is an official religion doesn't mean that there is freedom of religion. It's in the constitution §67. You should know that your country has freedom of religion. You must be undanish to be against it. You should be embarrassed by making such an absurd claim.

Just because it is a law, then it does not make it a value. Stop being an idiot, please.

&gt;No. This is integration.

Assimilation.

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"(continued)

&gt;I don't know the situation in Denmark. In Sweden communists and the far-right try to clash with each other. I haven't heard of any violent anarchists here. The Muslims I know thought those drawings were insulting and of bad taste, then they stopped caring and pitied the person who drew them because of his ignorance. Not all Muslims are violent like you seem to believe.

Generally the Nazis are not the ones causing any violence at all in Denmark. Their peaceful protests are often attacked and opposed by anarchists however, so they get violent as a result.

And must I absolutely stress that I do not by default find Muslims violent? Where do you get this absurd idea from? Seriously half your perceptions about me seems to be magically spun from the air to suit your - wrong by the way - narrative of me as some sort of racist bigot.

Now, the extremely obvious point that was made is that a believer is easier for an extremist to turn into another extremist. Get it? Faith is a gateway to madness.

And please, don't bring up Christianity. There is 500 years of moderation between that and Islam, and even then Christianity is obviously still harmful. Just not as much. Islam is in its 'Witch Hunt' stage. Remember those lovely religious wars all across Europe when the Catholic Church splintered? The Crusades? Yeah, many segments of Islam still think we are back there. Some Christian segments certainly do too.

&gt;Ignorance leads to extremism. Intolerance leads to extremism. Fanatics exist everywhere. It's more likely that a left wing person turns into a communist than centrist or liberal. It's more likely a nationalist becomes violent because of his intolerance to different people.

Is that a reason to invite in more, or at least not try to combat extremism?

&gt;In this case cultural differences don't really matter. Obviously there has to be integration so this person functions in society. The family will in the end be assimilated because the children will be identify themselves as Danish or part Danish. Even if one of the parents doesn't see as him or herself as Danish.

In the end cultural differences really do matter. It takes a lot longer for assimilation to happen if the parents cannot help, and it certainly does not help if the family has been forced into a ghetto due to a lack of assimilation of the parents in the first place. By simply churning people through an integration without bothering to have them assimilate into society you are setting them up to fail. You are not actually giving them a chance in hell to make a better life for themselves. Because culture does matter and it will always matter. That's reality.

&gt;What? When have I ever said there shouldn't be conditions. They have to follow the law and live normally just like everybody else.

And how are they supposed to live normally like everybody else without any kind of assimilation into society? You're just setting them up to fail.

&gt;It is relevant because the state of many poorer countries would be better if there was no colonialism. Some of these countries could be a democracy by now if they would have developed naturally on its own. This could lead to less extremism in the world and less refugees whom in your eyes seem to threaten society.

And..? You seem to be missing a point there.

&gt;Many of these people want to go back to their country of origin once it becomes a lot better place to live in, like not a brutal dictatorship which could execute them for being different or not a bombsite.

So they are seeking asylum, and otherwise being too cowardly to resist.

&gt;Some of these people flee to countries to Denmark to be allowed to be different. You aren't much better than them if you tell them they have to become Danish to stay. It doesn't matter if these people lead normal lives.

And I have no sympathy for these people. Look they're allowed to be here if they play by our rules and conform. I don't let strangers into my home without expecting them to obey my rules and conform to the household either. Denmark - as a nation - is not a charity, and think that is something you forget. It is a household.

No, I was attacking your ideology as well by comparing you to the drones and murderers that have advocated it in the past. 

&gt;State capitalist (socialist?) empire

State capitalist? Hilarious.

&gt;whom I do not and have never claimed to support, be influenced by, have any respect for, etc. in an attempt to discredit my argument. 

Of course you support it. Your rhetoric is the same century-old shit used to sell socialism the first time around. In fact, the lack of modernization in your rhetoric is rather appalling: you seem to think every person is a ""worker"" in some industrial factory.

&gt;A conspiracy so transparent that even Adam Smith believed in it.

That doesn't make it any more believable. I'll believe in this centuries-long collaboration whenever I see actual evidence of it. As it stands, you're blaming what is likely an emergent property of the economy on the willful actions of people who you conveniently decline to name.

&gt;Right...of course.

I can't tell if you're admitting to being wrong here or simply ignoring a point that destroys your silly argument. 

&gt;Of course it is, in many ways wealth is as concentrated as it's ever been, and often throughout that whole time period.

And in many ways it's not. A large middle class exist, for example, and a large number of people are business owners through the distributed means of stock ownership. Like it or not, as long as the middle class exists your revolution won't come. And as long as people can own part of the businesses of the world they're not likely to hate the owners.

&gt; I'd have to look up the specific, but roughly half the land in the UK is owned by a few hundred thousand people, and a substantial part of that by a few families whose holdings have been extant since William the Conqueror.

And? Is no land available for anyone that wants it?

&gt;In the US, the half dozen heirs of the Walton family own more wealth between them than the bottom 42% of Americans.

And? Their possession of more wealth than others doesn't make them poorer or worse off. Unless they're physically harming themselves in fits of jealous, as you might.

&gt;S/He's a little bit free to select his master

A little free? Entirely free.

&gt;s/he's still stuck in capitalist wage slavery

Again with the dictionary rape. An employment contract in which the employee keeps his wages and can quit at any time is the opposite of slavery. Please stop trying to corrupt the meaning of words with your Newspeak.

&gt;Much of the time s/he's free to choose between his/her shitty job and unemployment.

So your actual problem is that people have the obligation to work in order to sustain themselves? That doesn't get better in your system, comrade. For some reason every young red thinks that after the revolution his talents will be recognized and he will become whatever passes for rich in socialist hellholes. That isn't the case. You'll probably end up on a turnip farm and you'll be shot if you try to leave.

&gt;Employees generally as cogs in their machine, sure, but unless you're particularly skilled or in very limited supply, any individual worker is disposable, more so under globalisation.

And, to the extent that any individual is disposable he is needed at other workplaces.

&gt;All the numbers on both sides are speculative, and awash with propaganda, but it's fairly clear capitalism is responsible for orders of magnitude more deaths than socialism.

Those are two independent phenomena. Should they have kept on workers they didn't need for the sake of charity? 

&gt;Now admit that's sick! 

No. The business is doing what it must to survive.

&gt;And while many will deny why and say to others so said people won't look at them for saying the unspeakable, I'll say it: IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF THAT FUCKING PROFIT.

That's the point of a business. It's not there for the sake of charity. 

&gt;People's work, small companies gets to ruin, whole societies gets fucked because some shareholder with already obscene amounts of money and capital decides that it's not enough.

The investor expects a return on investment. This isn't unreasonable. 

&gt;A large company just fired 240 people in a small town not far from were I live. It's a town with a population of 5000~ Do you understand what kind of burden that produces?

The company isn't a welfare agency. Your state, which does have an ample welfare service, is there to pick up that slack and that business has been paying exorbitant taxes to enable that safety net for its entire existence. 

&gt;How is this not sick? If it goes bad for the major companies, the rest will follow.

Businesses aren't charities. Judging them by the standards of a charity is like judging a fish on its ability to climb trees.

It seems as if there are people in government there who are hell-bent on social engineering and experimentation. I remember reading an article recently on how toy adverts had to show boys playing with dolls and girls playing with army vehicles as a way to combat societal gender role inference. Except that well-researched, settled science tells us that there are genetic differences in behaviour, toy preference, etc in children.

In fact, it goes so far to me as to be oppressive to people with gender identity issues because if you are a boy who likes girls' toys, it isn't something you can discover on your own and be accepted for, but a unique identity that's being whitewashed because you're no longer ""unique""...and that's where confusion sets in, because sexuality and gender aren't black and white except for the physical aspects of it and people who are different do deserve to be recognised as such.",0,1357787285,null,0,false,0,c7u7n34,t3_168sl5,t1_c7u7n34,t1_c7txhpi,null,1430912038,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10
true,uututhrwa,null,null,"&gt;It is the Greeks who are vouching for far left and far right retards.

I was going to complain about people doing this in my country and since you pointed it out I'll do it here. You often see Greeks on the internet doing the following things that eventually give us all a bad name

- not really acknowledging the fact that the problem in the way the greek economy works is structural vs a few bad guys being responsible for everything

- common sense is bullshit, if a foreigner goes ""you owe all that money somethings gotta be wrong innit"" he'll get the reply: that he's a naive slave that bought the propaganda of his evil neoliberal masters eyeing greece's resources

- preference for beaurocracy (such as some OECD study proving Greeks work more than south koreans) than concrete results

- conspiracy theories (the germans being after still yet to be found oil reserves)

- some gargantuan ambitious plan of usually leftist-authoritarian political change in the entire continent. You'll see some eloquent people going on about something and then realize they more or less talk about hardcore stalinism or some fanfic type of anarchy, as if they are something completely normal and readily achievable

- a call to arms and other forms of attacking normal democratic institutions, the people must rise, it's all a matter of joining the revolution vs trying to approach things as a technocrat would

- talk of traitors cowards heroes leaders etc.

Well all the above are the result of how deep in hypocrisy political debate has been in Greece. People got trained to claim X even if they were 100% sure it wasn't true, cause being rational and honest is a trait of cowards. Trade offs are never openly discussed, they are dealt with in some dark room at 3 am in the morning, and then a lawyer uses heroic words to distort it or it never gets mentioned at all. As for the far leftism for many Greeks it is something like a second nation, it's  different than being liberal/ progressive or sometimes even a european socialist. They'll be like ""if I even by the slightest take a view pushed by capitalists then I am insulting all of my ancestors that fought in the Greek Civil war"".

I hope that as a country we can improve on those aspects. Ancient Greeks used to be known for their pursuit of the middle ground, modern greeks do pretty much the opposite.
