More common Czech sentiment towards Poland regarding the WW2 would be 'at least they actually fought' and 'Katyń must have sucked'

And the first association that comes to mind when you ask Czech about Poland and communism would be Lech Walesa, he is considered quite the hero.

edit: if there would be slight anti Polish sentiment it would be caused mostly by our media's witchhunt against low-quality Polish food being imported, the depth of Polish faith (Czechlands are predominatedly atheistic) and the troubles caused by rednecks and hooligans at our festivals and partying venues.

true,syrte,null,null,"&gt;Thats simply a load of bollox, the real wage growth was 1.6% between 1990-2013 here in sweden (medlingsinstitutet).

1.6% is the average per year.

Now compare that to Spain

1993-1998 - 1.8% growth

1999 - 0.5% growth

2000 - **-**0.4% fall

2001 - 0.3%

2002 - 0.8%

2003 - 0.6%

2004 - 0.7%

2005 - 0.3%

2006 - 1.1%


Now Italy,

1993-1998 - 0.7% growth

1999 - **-**0.3% fall

2000 - **-**0.5% fall

2001 - **-**0.2% fall

2002 - **-**0.9% fall

2003 - **-**0.1% fall

2004 - 0.4%

2005 - **-**0.2% fall

Do you want me to include the crisis years 2008+ as well? It would lower the percentages even more.

In Spain, they've gone down by 7% from 2009 to 2013.

In Italy down by 3%.

In Greece they've gone down by 22% in that same timeframe.

Sweden's price index (cost of goods) is 124%, Italy's is 111%, Spain's is 93% of the European average.

The average wage in Spain is **€1,499**. The average wage in Italy is **€1,774**. Both of those numbers are actually outdated now as the average wages are now even lower.

What's the average wage in Sweden? I'm sure you know better than me, so tell me.

&gt; Are you kidding me? Its obvious, the sotuh simply does not have functioning institutions and it is no use pretending otherwise.

The north wouldn't have functioning institutions either if it were forced into heavy austerity due to a deficit, or if it were forced to lower its debts during a crisis.

if you translate it literally and then look at how this translation sounds, sure, it could be condesending.

but

a) that's rather poor translating, because the meaning will get twisted and 

b) you should at least translate it correctly. 

""junge, pass doch mal auf!"" --&gt; ""boy, watch out/pay attention""

also junge is a colloquialism, which could better be translated with dude or mate or something like that.

so we already went from ""watch it, boy!"" to ""watch out, mate!""

when we also add my anecdotal experience of this sentence being one of the rather automative responses that are being said without much thought in certain situations it explains how he dared speaking german to you.

But no doubt arctic winter upon arctic winter has strengthened the vikings! I read in history class that vikings would put their newly birthed infants in the snow to kill off the ones that couldn't handle the freezing temperatures. Viking history is cool as fuck ;)

&gt;many people do move permanently to e.g Thailand or Spain when they retire

Well we do that too ;) We retire in Belize and Ecuador because why the fuck not? In fact I have to imagine that being old, the arctic winters could unleash a whole host of morbidities associated with a weakened immune system and reduced physical activities (But I'm talking out of my ass because Swedish longevity exceeds ours by about 3 years)

&gt;vacation times also allow many people to leave the country for the tropics during the darkest weeks

You bastards and your government mandated vacation time!!! For every 25 weeks of work I get a week &gt;.&lt;

I know, I keep wondering how they were able to pull it off (and quite frankly if they're telling the truth)

One American was talking about how he was able to get a home in Norway and move all his children there. 1 year and -$30,000(life savings) later he was able to find work without linguistic fluency. I call bullshit!

&gt;their rudimentary broken English really stands out in a country where every teenager is fluent.

Your absolutely right. I mean, what could a Greek or Spaniard without fluency possibly offer in such where everyone is so educated and qualified?

&gt;most employers will prefer hiring locals, finding a job normally requires being in the country already

Not to mention legal requirements. I know that for many EU countries employers must prove to the government that they are unable to find a domestic worker before allowing a foreigner to ""steal"" that job from one of their citizens. I am distressed to admit that is comprehensibly justifiable :/

Not to mention how impeccably unbroken your English is. Hell, even the random Swedish Redditor is virtually indistinguishable from us native speakers.



&gt;The number one thing is that people are not trusting.

This seems so counter-intuitive. I mean, communism was based on the concept of equality, and community. I understand that the reality of communism is a far cry from equal opportunity for all, but still. It's just difficult to understand how interdependence could breed such wariness.

 But I suppose when the soviet ringleader was a paranoid schizophrenic, doctrine becomes skewed.

How does the older generation feel about it? Do they miss the soviet days and have difficulty assimilating? Also always wondered why so many were sad to the fall of such a human-rights violating regime.

* Fish'nChips!

* Improbable number of accents across the UK [The tip of the iceberg.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_accents_of_English#Great_Britain)

* Speaking of which, brits tend to be quite picky about foreign actors trying a brit accent. Just saying!

* Do not try to cut any queue. Anywhere. Ever. ^unless ^you're ^pregnant. Most brits **hate** that and they **will** let you know.

* Fuck the metric system. Fuck left driving. Fuck the €. 

* As a french bon vivant I have to say this: this marmite thing needs to stop. Seriously. 

* Scottish banks print their own versions of the british pound £. Each bank have it's own design. These ""[Scottish notes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_pound_sterling#Scotland)"" are widely accepted throughout the United Kingdom.  Likewise you won't have a problem when using English notes anywhere in Scotland.

* Mind the Gap. Also London's tube (or subway if you prefer) is the world's oldest and second-longest rapid transit system. 

* There is a [Ronald Reagan Statue](http://metro.co.uk/2011/07/04/ronald-reagan-statue-in-grosvenor-square-unveiled-by-condoleeza-rice-64881/) in London.

* Tobacco price may vary from one retailer to another in the uk.

* The Gateshead Millennium Bridge in Newcastle is [bloody amazing!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0jWqziY3Kw&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;t=12)

* Public museums are free.

* In my experience, the brits have a high working ethic, way more so than in southern europe. Business is serious business indeed. Your mileage may vary ofc.

* In london clubs and even some bars, if you go to the loo(toilets) you probably will find a toilet attendant in there, and usually a wide variety of soaps, cologne, etc.. 

* The UK national flag, also known as the Union Jack, combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of St George for England and Wales, the white saltire of St Andrew for Scotland (which two were united in the first Union Flag), and the red saltire of Saint Patrick's Flag to represent Ireland.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"&gt; First off, which countries are the cheapest to live in?

As someone else implied, the cheaper countries are also those where the salary is lower. As a Frenchman going to, say, Ukraine, as a tourist, things will be extremely cheap with my French salary. A Ukranian tourist in France however will be appalled by the high prices.

I had a friend in France who loved to travel and all, and was considering moving to Peru for some reason. Even if she could get a middle class job there, where she'd live comfortably, she'd need to save two months salary just for a one way trip by plane to Europe. See what I mean?

So, for now, you might want to stick to the richer countries of Europe, which are more expensive, but the salaries are higher and you could afford a ticket back to the US. Once you've determined the richer countries, then there may be a way to determine which is the better in terms of salary and cost of living ratio... Obviously though, each country has diverse costs of living depending on where you are. Paris, for example, is very expensive, whereas other big cities of France are much cheaper to live in...

&gt; Which countries governments have the best benefits?

It depends what you're looking for. Quite a few Western European countries have universal healthcare, some have free universities, some have outrageous welfare, some have low retirement wages... Which ones do you want? (it's a rhetorical question, I couldn't answer all these since I mostly just know about France).

&gt; Which countries allow duel citizenship with America? and/or which countries are easiest to obtain citizenship in?

Most countries allow duel citizenship. To obtain French citizenship for example, you need to work here for a few of years, or marry a French person. Comparatively speaking, I gather countries like France, Belgium and the UK (and maybe Sweden) would be easier to obtain citizenship than others.

I think it's probably a leftover from the war, where Dutch people would always try to screw the Germans in some way or another, as a form of ""resistance,"" even though most acts of ""resistance"" were actually silly or ineffective.

[This comedy duo did a short film about this back in 1985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x67rym66tbs). It's a fake documentary about two brothers who go to their garden allotment during the liberation day celebration, and keep going on about the older brother's ""act of resistance"" during German occupation. Apparently, when he was a 14 year old during the war, when a German had asked him for directions to the train station, he had pointed him in the wrong direction:

&gt; *""Wo ist der Bahnhof?""*
&gt;
&gt; *-""Do ist der Bahnhof.""*

It's these tiny acts of questionable ""resistance"" old people like to brag about, that have become a running gag in the Netherlands. Any misleading act, that in actuality doesn't exceed the scope of your typical innocent high school prank, becomes a ""heroic act of resistance"" in the context of Nazi occupation.

The film also pokes fun at the Dutch old people's massive blind spot for how large parts of society actually collaborated with the Nazis. The two brothers talk about their dad like he's some kind of resistance hero, but if you listen carefully the picture emerges that the man was actually a huge Nazi collaborator scumbag.",0,1376986182,null,0,1376987651,0,cbrfyzm,t3_1kovte,t1_cbrfyzm,t1_cbr79r5,null,1429766647,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

EU member states do not share the same views at all on those topics, quite the contrary, they even have irreducible divergent interests, and we can already see the catastrophic effects of the euro, due to the fact that a currency represents a nation, and all 17 using the common currency do not have similar economies.

For instance if I passed a law A and then a law B that said ""everything in law A does not apply"" and then passed a law C that said ""everything in law B does not apply"" that has the net result of restoring law A. Even if law C doesn't say anything about law A. Law A never went away. It is kept in parliament for a reason.

Every single law and judgement is kept on the books because some freak instance could cause them to re-emerge even after they've been killed.

The difference in comparison to civil law is that civil law keeps an ongoing central state of laws. You don't write bills that law about other bills but instead make amendments to the central law. Once made the bills themselves can be thrown out. The static state of the codified law is the sole basis of the law.

Speaking about nightlife, there are 3 main areas around the city center you might wanna check out:
1) Piazza Vittorio, with lots of bars in and outside the square. Unfortunately the clubs on the Murazzi river bank got closed recently, thanks Fassino

2) Quadrilatero Romano, the block within the old roman walls, is packed with wine bars where you can have nice apericena (that is when you got for an aperitif, but then eat like a pig and end up drunk there. All for 5-10 eur).

3) San Salvario, it was formerly a bad neightborhood, but it got recently cleaned up and is full with bars and ethnic restaurants. Recommended, but not if you have to park a car.

Luckily in Turin there are nightbuses in the weekends that run the most commonly used routes, so if you don't find an apartment too far outside form town, you are all set.

If you are into tinkering and DIY, you might wanna check out the Toolbox, Turin's FabLab.

Ce qui compte c'est une normalisation par individu. Tout d'abord parce que c'est un problème global, mais surtout parce que il y a un énorme biais à cause de la superficie du pays. Par exemple, l'Australie et la Russie apparaîtront comme élèves modèles uniquement à cause de territoires inhabités immenses. Et il n'est pas utile non plus de montrer du doigt le Japon qui est une île sans grands espaces. En gros multiplier le rapport par la surface du pays, et la diviser par le nombre d'habitants... En faisant ça, et en normalisant par l'indice du monde entier, on obtient le classement suivant, qui reflète la consommation par individu, bien différent :

* Inde : 0.14
* Angleterre : 0.42
* France : 0.5
* Chine : 0.56
* Italie : 0.63
* Japon : 0.65
* Suisse : 0.66
* Egypte : 0.91
* Qatar : 1.09
* Grèce : 1.19
* USA : 1.75

Ce classement donne une couleur différente au propos je trouve : les français ne sont pas meilleurs que les indiens, loin de là. Spécifiquement, le français moyen est environ 3 fois plus consommateur que l'indien moyen, mais en revanche environ 3 fois moins que l'américain moyen qui est le plus gros pollueur loin devant.

We have such folk stories too. I think they're traditional all over Europe. 

The Finnish village is called Hölmölä (Idiotville) and its inhabitants are very honest and hard working idiots. One of them (Matti) is smart but gets sometimes regarded as the village idiot by others because they cannot comprehend his ideas.

In one story they built a house. But to their huge disappointment it was dark inside. After pondering the problem they came to conclusion that the darkness is because of lack of light inside. And there's plenty of light outside. So they took these big sacks and started running back and forth carrying light. 

Matti came by and asked what's up. After hearing the problem he took a big axe and to other's astonishment hacked a small hole in the wall - a window as he called it. Now there was light in the house. But it was still far too dim for their taste, so the villagers all grabbed axes and hacked some more.

After hacking down three walls the house collapsed. Which was kinda bummer for everybody. Until they realized the silver lining - now they have just as much light as outside.",0,1376989731,null,0,false,0,cbrghkr,t3_1kovh5,t1_cbrghkr,t1_cbr7gh2,null,1429766334,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Questi annunci di nuove nascite inoltre diffondono il mito che avere un bambino sia qualcosa di cui essere orgogliosi, alimenta la pressione sulla società sull'importanza di mettere al mondo nuove bocche da sfamare che poi avranno bisogno di nuove case, ulteriore cementificazione, aumento di spazzatura da smaltire e richiederanno ulteriori risorse energetiche e naturali da consumare. Una catena di bisogni che è ben vista in una società capitalistica che vuole vendere prodotti e servizi e che per questo spinge attraverso la chiesa, la televisione e la politica la necessità di risolvere un problema che in realtà è una cosa positiva: il calo delle nascite. Alla fine ogni nuovo bambino porta a un aumento dell'inquinamento, all'estinzione della fauna, incrementa la povertà e per ultimo contribuisce alla fame di massa.

Spero in una forte decrescita delle nascite e che si tornerà a numeri accettabili. Tra il 1650 e il 1850 il mondo è passato da 500 milioni di abitanti a 1 miliardo.

No you can't. You need to wait 5 years, accept the fact that media support 90% of the current system (so a vast majority will vote for whatever it is told), have an electoral system that favours certain parties. 

This is why you can never have a UKIP of the left in the UK, nor anywhere else in Europe. You can't do what the labour government did in 46. Left politics are dead at the moment all over the place.

Then again, you never know. This really is a big issue in Germany.

Video on the topic: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbueX92CKPk

Edit: I found the following sources listed below. Source 4 studied income mobility of its period of study compared with the previous decade. It found that the increase in social mobility over time was within the margin of error, therefore I must retract my previous statement. According to these data (and their associated statistical significance), the gap between rich and poor is growing, but everyone is getting richer in absolute terms (adjusted for inflation), and income mobility between socioeconomic levels is constant over time.

No surprise on the impact of a university education and the importance of being trained to think critically. Matches what we currently understand and what is clear from the literature.

Am surprised to see that women are more culturally supremacist than men, even if very slight. Is this biological (i.e. are women more likely to be protectionist because of their maternal instincts?) or is it because more boys go to university than women in these countries (possibly because families prioritise the boy's education over the girls because they girl 'can always become a stay at home mom' whereas the boy 'will have to provide')?

Interesting to see the rise of the right in the British youth. You'd expect to see younger generations more open and less elitist than older participants. Britain bucks this trend (both perceived generally and demonstrated in the other countries in the study) in the that slide.

Well, aside from that, Turin is the most beautiful and enjoyable especially in autumn/winter, with all lights on under the colonnades and all the cafes that beckon their patrons with the aromas of freshly baked pastries and tarts and the hot chocolate and the others specialty(wickedly delicious [bicerìn and zabaglione](http://www.bicerin.it/eng/) for once). Keep in mind that Turin is the chocolate capital and every year there's a [feast](http://www.cioccola-to.it/2012/home.php) to celebrate it, but really, the chocolate flows in the city all year round.

For me, and for at least one thousand years, western Europe is UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Benelux. I mean, all of these countries share their history with each other, often belonging to the same empire.

You've always done your own thing up North, and you rarely took part to what happened in western Europe.


As a frenchman I feel a connexion with Spain and Italy, because our language and culture are very close, and there are HUGE, more than from any other european, italian and spanish community in France, with a large part of the french population being of italian, spanish or portuguese origin. Also, fighting the spanish empire or the different italian cities states takes a huge place in our history.

I also do feel a connexion with the UK. Liking or disliking the UK in France doesn't change the fact that we share most of our history with them : english has been heavily influenced by french, their motto is in French, they had french king for a shitload of time, a huge part of France (more than half actually) used to belong to England ! We are the ""eternal enemy"". And even today we are not indifferent to what happen in the UK especially on EU question and their like.

I also do feel a connexion with Germany. Not only invading France has been (and often with success) one of the main german goal for a long time, but the germano-french friendship is the foundation of the EU, we have a shitload of cultural project in common, german is one of the most learned language in France (well not always with success) etc.

But Scandinavia ? I don't feel any connexion with Scandinavia. I don't really know who you are or what you do. For me there's western Europe, eastern Europe, southern Europe (which cross-cut western and eastern Europe), and well, Scandinavia. You are your own European region, with your own history.

My prediction is that eventually France, Belgium and the EU lowland countries will become a union state.  The UK would be invited to join the union but because this is the UK they would refuse.  Ireland would join the union.  Eventually this would be followed by Spain and Portugal. It is unlikely the balkan states or Greece would join the union state, since there is a lot of nationalist sentiment within these countries.

After a few parties, they made enough to pay for everything and it left them with a nice profit. Others tried learning how to build websites and iPhone apps so that they could create something in their time off in the hopes that someone would be interested and would buy their apps (or generate ad revenue).

true,JimmyNic,ENGL,England,"It's an interesting point about the language barrier, and I somewhat agree with you that if it was gone a lot of the other stuff would melt away. For most people it does still exist, and whilst many young Europeans feel an American influence the cultural transaction is, for the non-Anglophones, entirely one directional. 

In terms of day to day interactions, the things I mentioned were more justifications for what is generally agreed to exist, a kind of cultural community that is bigger than the boundaries of state. The fact that we refer to the Anglophones as our cousins is indicative of an attitude that we are in some sense the same people. 

Because of the jargon surrounding Britishness/Englishness it sounds absurd to talk of ""the English"" being dispersed amongst several states in the same way that the Irish are dispersed amongst the same collection of states. While Italian American, Irish American, and African American are all accepted terms, the idea of being English American is tautologous – the Americans by default are English, only a deviation from that need be noted. 

All that said, I don't personally feel very different from the rest of Northern Europe (France, Low countries, Germany, and Scandinavia), I just don't think this is an attitude shared by all that many Brits. To my mind the feeling of cultural dislocation is what drives the move towards an EU exit, and I think this notion is not widely understood on the continent.

When you factor in culture and politics, I'd say we're about halfway between the States and the EU. It's not proving a comfortable place to be.

The proximity of the British Isles to the European continent is made too much of, particularly once one considers Westminster's historic aversion to European affairs. Unlike many other European nations, there is not a culture of popping across the border for lunch in Britain; if Britain is a neighbour it is the cantankerous curmudgeon who isolates himself from the rest of the street, instead preferring to spend his free time out of town.

The Anglosphere all know some British history, because they have all at one time been British. That this doesn't translate to the parochial affairs of each specific country is not particularly important, and because of American media dominance the average Brit's knowledge of the US North-South divide is likely to be far in excess of their awareness of Bavarian or Catalonian separatism.

People who dismiss the cultural links between the Anglosphere are generally people interested in European integration, just as those who emphasise British history are more likely to be Eurosceptic.

In my opinion, I have no facts to back this up, but I think Americans are different because of the way we were founded.  Anyone who first came over here, knew that it would require a lot of hard work to become successful in the new land. It's the ""land of opportunity"" not the land of receiving/taking. It's always been understood in our culture that if you work hard, you can be successful.  It's ingrained in us since birth and this mentality has been passed down through the generations. Over the decades and centuries, that mentality is beginning to change, which is why things like Obamacare are starting to appear over here. We are becoming a nation that is no longer about working hard and earning your own way, we are becoming a nation that looks for the easy way and what can we get for free. Over 40% of our country is dependent on some type of income from the government. This has never happened before, and is showing why the mentality is changing from ""earners"" to ""receivers/takers"". If these surveys were taken 50 years ago, I guarantee the numbers would be much higher for the US.

Horthy? Who didn't let german troops to Poland through Hungary when Germany wanted to invade them? Cuz we couldn't do that with our eternal friends. Horthy who tried to delay the deportations?

Horthy was a nacionalist on his own, but not a nazi who wanted to kill the jews and gypsies, he was anti-red(anti-communist) and that's it.

Because it's what civilized societies do. You may have worked hard, but you were also given many advantages thanks to the hard work of your fellow countrymen. You drove on paved roads, drank clean water, and breathed clean air thanks to taxes paid for by your neighbors. We have the welfare system in place for a reason. Less than a hundred years ago there was blood running in the streets because over-worked and under-paid factory workers could not feed their children. The company men would take everything. It took the great depression and second world war to strike the new deal and reel in the upper class (if mostly from the fear of a communist uprising).  In order to get a little, you have to give a little back. It's incredibly depressing that many Americans seem to have forgotten this - and I'm saying this as an American.

That is something you wrote, do you still stand by this point?

As for Englishness being closer to Germanness and Americanness, I would argue for our European neighbors. 

The American culture is one of a whole multitude of different cultures, their nation and history was founded through that of many different countries and their people fleeing the ""Old Countries"", those who never saw and agreed with the European ideals of the old times. 
European culture and history is older, richer and more intertwined with one another. This has lead to a greater exchange maybe more than you can see. Europe has had many conflicts, trade agreements and the languages have influenced each other. 

&gt;The US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia are Anglo-Saxon states, to the point they aren't considered foreign. We have the same language, similar legal systems, shared historical figures, even the same head of state (US exempt).

Taking another sentence you wrote and rewording it. Europe and the UK are geographically so close to one another compared to states such as NZ, Australia and the US that they shouldn't be considered foreign. Many of us have a language in common, whether French, English or German, spoken by the majority of the EU. Our legal systems are not allowed to contradict one another to the point that it goes against EU legislation, we also can all get our voices heard by the same legal framework at the European courts. We have historical figures who are also common to us all whether Henry the 8th, Charlemagne or Hitler these people all influenced over their current ""national"" borders. Our heads of states may not be the same, they act similar and many of them are related to one another and have family in other European countries.

Consider that many of our heads of states are not fully ""German"", ""English"" or ""Danish"".... They are closer in blood than we think.",0,1377008455,null,0,false,0,cbrjzl7,t3_1kq34n,t1_cbrjzl7,t1_cbrjgau,null,1429764701,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

One of the failures of the attack was that there weren't German ships to bomb.

At the time Finland and UK were not at war. Only about four months later Churchill decared war on Finland - he did it a bit reluctantly obliging to Sovjet demands. Other commonwealth countries Australia, Canada and New Zealand followed.

But, to it's favor, Portugal has a big fishing zone. also, it's continental location makes it vulnerable to invasions unlike the UK or the US. 

So, despite not having been invaded recently, it has a long history of conflict that left deep scars in the landscape and in the culture. And what troubles Portugal is also that it's caught between tugs of political and financial pressure. Nothing apart from deep seated corruption can explain why after a long period of thousands of tonnes of ores, spice, gems and precious metals pouring from former colonies, even as far back as Brazil, still allowed Portugal to need consistent financial aid throughout it's history, particularly from Britain. We were kept on a lifeline by external influences and the active corruption of our courts and our politicians. Can you explain why? We were easy pickings and kept in a loophole of weak leaders. We never had our great leader in these last 500 years. A person capable of unifying. We could have had a few but they were always shot down by the status quo when perceived as a threat.

Portugal has no friends. Only people with shady interests to the likes ""dealers"" and loan sharks, but to a international scale. It's still the same today. If one were to look at the reasons of why we need bailouts, it's because the people's interests never come first. Private ones do. The EU come after and if there's anything left, those scraps are ours.

I won't write off our blame. It's all ours. We accommodated to our misery and that usually sends off bad signals. The kind of signals that attract vultures and other opportunistic scavengers. We should have made a bigger effort to get rid of this ailment. All it would take is a succession of proper leadership. A strong, charismatic and selfless leadership. Not the joke we have had over 30 or even 200 years.

We need to undergo big changes. ",0,1377010470,null,0,false,0,cbrkn6c,t3_1kq34n,t1_cbrkn6c,t1_cbrjyjd,null,1429764395,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Yes, a very difficult debate.  So why are you trying to pretend that my position has suddenly become weaker because it has been revealed he was in the pay of the Guardian?

The facts as we have are as follows:

* The Guardian is in possession of top secret files.  Fine, as long as they are used responsibly and in the public interest.  I'd hope that everybody in this thread would agree that e.g. publishing the names and details of informants to the British security services is clearly not in the public interest.
* Instead of using the files responsibly, we have the Guardian's journalists apparently copying them and handing them to an individual who is not even in a formal relationship with the Guardian, but merely the partner of one of its journalists.  How many ministers of state pass secret files on to their spouses and have them carry them around?  How many police, or security service offices?  It's a sackable offence, and stupid.  The Guardian, on the other hand, is apparently happy to have spouses of journalists fly these files around all over the world.
* Said individual then tries to fly the files out of the country to Brazil where they can quite easily be ""acquired"" by the Brazilian security services, potentially compromising legitimate work of the British security services.
* Said individual was stopped by the Police whilst transiting Britain and had the files confiscated.

You can quite easily separate the issues over whether the Guardian and its journalists have a legitimate need to own those files from the issue that apparently the Guardian are acting like a bunch of morons passing them around to who knows who and flying them all over the world.

&gt; You did not the key answer: is he a terrorist? Because he was detained under law specifically designed for terrorists.

Where possible states need to be shrunk to keep a proportional state constitution.  As such, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would become independent of the UK (which would be the state of England), also I can imagine France and Germany completely dissolving as entities with the French regions, German states all being European states.  Similar situation in Spain and Italy. 

Military would be locally trained but centrally controlled.  Economy would be in the euro and controlled centrally.

There would need to be some work though in still allowing heads of governments in individual states to have a say without detracting from the federal government.

So that's why were poor? What about countries like Sweden or Australia?

&gt;Were it not for farming and mass starvation would likely wipe out a huge chunk of Europe.

What?

&gt;So, despite not having been invaded recently, it has a long history of conflict that left deep scars in the landscape and in the culture.

Portugal has a long history of conflicts? Then what about countries like France, Germany and Poland or China, South Korea and Japan?

&gt;And what troubles Portugal is also that it's caught between tugs of political and financial pressure.

Portugal has experienced some political and financial pressure? And what about pretty much every other country in the world, don't they also have that?

&gt;We were kept on a lifeline by external influences and the active corruption of our courts and our politicians. Can you explain why? We were easy pickings and kept in a loophole of weak leaders.

If all our problems are caused by corruption in our political system, we've ought to have done something to remedy that. If the monarchy was like that, the first republic was like that, the dictatorship was like that and now the democracy is like that, whom else can we blame but ourselves?

&gt;We never had our great leader in these last 500 years.

If you're still waiting for D. Sebastião, you can keep on waiting.

We've had plenty of good people and yet they all failed.. I don't blame the players, I blame the game.

&gt;A person capable of unifying.

Our country is one of the most homogeneous there is, I don't know what you're talking about.

&gt;We could have had a few but they were always shot down by the status quo when perceived as a threat.

And who is that status quo if not us? Aren't we the masters of our own destiny?

&gt;Portugal has no friends. Only people with shady interests to the likes ""dealers"" and loan sharks, but to a international scale.

Yeah, we're all alone in this life, we can only truly rely in ourselves in this cold and dark world. Though does this only apply to Portugal or is it something that also happens in other countries?

&gt;It's still the same today. If one were to look at the reasons of why we need bailouts, it's because the people's interests never come first. Private ones do.

That didn't make any bit of sense. Firstly, nobody has ever spent their money on anybody else out of love, it's always out of self-interest. You think when people lend money to Germany or the USA that they do it for anything else other than the interest rates they'll receive? Did Portugal ever loan money without asking for something in return?

As for the people's interests and private interests, what do you mean by that? Aren't the people's interests the sum of all private interests?

&gt;The EU come after and if there's anything left, those scraps are ours.

That's the same for everybody else and everywhere else in the world.

&gt;All it would take is a succession of proper leadership. A strong, charismatic and selfless leadership.

aka some mythical creature which knows what's best for us and will act to benefit us and not himself despite our constant cynicism, whining and scapegoating. Yeah, good luck with that. I wager that we could wait 1000 years and nobody like that would ever come around.

Here's a good one: 

So, an Englishman, a German and a Portuguese are auditioning for special task force that is about to test their loyalty in what they think is a harmless way. 

The test consists of giving them a gun and making them go inside a shack and shoot whoever is in there in the head, no matter who it is. 

What they don't know is that the guns are loaded with blanks and inside the shack is each man's wife.

In goes the Englishman and after a few minutes inside he just bursts out in tears and promptly abandons the unit.

Then goes the German takes a little longer inside but also leaves in tears and a mental wreck without firing. He also is forced out.

In goes the Portuguese ... after a while he comes out and says to the instructors. The gun failed on me but luckily I had a chair at hand!! It's done. Sign me up.",0,1377011977,null,0,false,0,cbrl63s,t3_1kovte,t1_cbrl63s,t1_cbr56hi,null,1429764151,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,valleyshrew,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Britain does have more in common with the US. These questions are stupidly biased.

Nobody in need versus freedom - Did none of the people answering think about what a lack of freedom to pursue your goals means? The only thing it can mean is slavery. Even communists are free to pursue goals. And what does people in need mean? It's impossible for an intelligent person to answer this question.

Success in life determined by forces outside control - that sounds quite like a religious attitude to me (der mentsh trakht un Got lakht). It's obviously easy to see answering either way. It is partly up to you (unless you want to argue there is no free will which is technically correct), and partly up to the circumstances you are given.

US - isolationism. And yet the US gives twice as much foreign aid as any other country, and is the most willing to liberate allies from invasion.

Culture - Even as a Brit I would say US culture is superior to any other. It's the melting pot of the world, and it's where the majority of great film, television, music and games are made. Britain has produced some good music but it's not even close in overall cultural output.  The US has won almost 3 times as many nobel prizes as any other country. They gave us the internet. Of course their culture is the greatest in the world.

Importance of religion - Who expected such a low figure for the US? Normally we hear about how 90% of Americans are Christian, and as much as 50% are the crazies that believe Jesus is coming back in their lifetime.

Necessary/not necessary to believe in God - like most of these questions, it's left up to interpretation precisely what this means. Does it mean the death penalty for those who dont? If I was a Christian I'm sure I would believe it necessary to be one to be a moral person, otherwise why be a Christian at all?

Sometimes necessary to use military force to maintain order in the world - I'm flabberghasted at the number of people who didn't answer agree. It shows how much people have been brainwashed by anti-war propaganda. Just because the wars in recent history haven't been legitimate doesn't mean it is never going to be necessary to have a military. How can anyone argue against the liberation of Kuwait or South Korea?

UN approval - The UN would not approve of the liberation of South Korea, because Russia &amp; China are on the security council. Europeans are not as aware of the UN's politics, and think it's some liberal group of peace lovers. A resolution was passed removing protection for gays a few years ago (south africa has since had one past reinstating it). A lot of countries jail and even execute gays, and the UN does nothing at all to stop it.

The UN has been particularly biased in the [Israeli-Palestinian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel,_Palestine,_and_the_United_Nations) conflict due to there being 51 Muslim states and only 1 Jewish state:

Actually no, its pretty tight and it is specifically there to deal with terrorism.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"Interesting read. I like how it delves into the inside thinking of German politicians. I doubt you would hear them openly saying things like this:

&gt;Their greatest worry is France...
&gt;You see, says one senior German politician, I let my daughter use my credit card, but I check the transactions record. I tease out the point: “And if the French girl is blowing it all on beautiful couture dresses…?” “Exactly!” he snorts. German officials say privately, **“We have to pretend to treat France as an equal.”** Their last, best hope for economic reform in France is that French national pride will not abide that country’s own relative decline and Germany’s palpable condescension.

That's a pretty scathing indictment of the eurozone's number two power. It seems the Germans have little faith in the French, yet must be seen to have faith in them. On a side note, this makes me interested to hear what other European politicians say behind closed doors, epsecially what they say about Germany.

And this seems to be the crux of the problem about the current conversation in the eurozone in terms of what the indebted, uncomptetive countries must do to reform their countries:

&gt;One simple, theoretical point seems to me worth stressing. Germany, the export champion, has been described as Europe’s China. **Just as not everyone in the world can be China, and if everyone were like China, China could not be China—for who would then buy its exports?—so not everyone in the eurozone can be Germany, and in the unlikely event that they did become like Germany, Germany could no longer be Germany.** Unless, that is, you assume that the rest of the world would cheerfully expand its domestic demand to buy an all-German eurozone’s increased supply of exports.

That's a very poignant observation. I've heard that argument before, and it seems pretty obvious, yet it is seemingly disgarded by German politicians. Not everyone can be like Germany, and if they were, Germany wouldn't be Germany. So why are they pressuring all the countries to be like them?

As it stands, it looks like this mentality will not change. It is understandable since the Germans have come so far, and have so much to lose:

&gt;Germans are understandably preoccupied with the danger of having to pay with their own hard-earned wages and savings for other Europeans’ self-indulgent mistakes. I lose count of the number of times people say to me, **“When outsiders ask us for leadership, what they mean is money.”**

true,[deleted],null,null,"Again, read the JackOfKent comments where there's practising lawyers in disagreement over whether the stop was legal or not.  Saying it ""specifically relates to terrorism"" begs the question as to what the statutory definition of terrorism is.

EDIT, for example:

&gt; Well written piece and as evident by the discussion thread, very thought provoking. I took a quick look at the link to the terrorism act you reference. The definition of terrorism is quite broad and given the circumstances of David Miranda’s departure, itinerary, and or conduct prior to his return to the UK (all unknown to me) , one cannot exclude that it was an appropriate detention in order to determine whether his conduct fell within the broad parameters of the Act.
David Miranda has been identified as a partner of Glen Greenwald. It is apparently undisputed that Eric Snowden stole state secrets of the United States under the guise of exposing unethical, improper or perhaps even illegal conduct of the US. Glen Greenwald has apparently seen those documents and wrote in an early piece as I recall that many of the stolen documents would in fact jeopardize the national security interests of the US. According to Greenwald those documents are now “safe” from disclosure. If all the foregoing is true it would seem derelict of the UK not to have investigated and determine whether Mr Snowden might have had a change of heart re the dissemination of the stolen secrets.
Lastly it would seem that in any analysis of the propriety of the conduct of the British agents, one would have to examine the written decisions of the Courts interpreting this Act. Its broad power is apparent on its face and it may well be that under facts similar to or almost identical to these, the detentions have been affirmed. Some Acts have a stated public purpose of ensuring the peace and protection of the public and therefore the Courts may well be construing that act liberally in order to give meaning to the stated purpose. Perhaps the courts have in fact previously ruled that conduct akin to what occurred here is lawful.

tl;dr: the definition of terrorism is broad, and often just reading the Act in isolation is insufficient to get a complete picture of the landscape, as interpretation of the courts is also key to understanding what is legal and what is not.",0,1377012766,null,0,1377013169,0,cbrlgmp,t3_1kq4sn,t1_cbrlgmp,t1_cbrlc5k,null,1429764014,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,jub-jub-bird,null,null,"&gt;I find it funny that in the USA only 36% believe that «success is determined by forces outside our control» while there one of the less socially mobile developed states.

There's a couple of reasons why the attitude persists despite the studies showing greater social mobility in most EU countries. First this is a relatively new phenomena, historically the USA has had greater social mobility.

Second these studies measure social mobility in terms of relative change: the probability that a child born into one quintile will move to another by mid-life. However all these studies also lament another problem with the USA: greater income inequality. In other words the spread between quintiles is much wider. So an income change in absolute terms that would move someone from one quintile to another in Europe may only move you within a single quintile in the USA. Or one that would move you two quintiles in many European countries would move you only one in the USA. To go from the bottom quintile to the top in the USA is a bigger absolute change than it is in the EU.

Third, over the course of decades the US economy has grown faster than the EU. I may feel i've experienced social mobility due to becoming richer even if everyone else is richer as well and I've experienced zero change relative to them.

Finally, most studies focus particularly on the bottom quintile, which in the USA experiences the least social mobility. A permanent underclass which is experiencing very little social mobility is a real and persistent  problem. But it is not the experience of the majority which does experience much greater social mobility. There was an interactive map of the USA in the NYtimes linked from reddit a few weeks ago. You could play with the numbers and see the social mobility from any point, everyone was focussed the top and bottom but I found the results at 50% results fascinating. The chances of someone born at the 50% point ending up in any quintile were an almost perfectly even 20% each. THIS is the experience is the middle class in the USA. A child who grows up in the middle class sees himself and his peers sorted evenly by income by the time they're grown. The hypothetical average at his 20th high school reunion (assuming everyone comes) he'll see the full spectrum in equal distributions from the poorest to the richest. And quite likely he'll see ways in which they each ""made their own luck"" to get there.... despite the experience of a permanent underclass that has a hard time getting out, the experience of complete mobility seen from the middle class is what drives the attitudes of the country.",0,1377014118,null,0,1377038953,0,cbrlz0r,t3_1kq34n,t1_cbrlz0r,t1_cbrgp9j,null,1429763775,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18

Many great games are in fact British made which may otherwise not be expected, such as the Grand Theft Auto series by Rockstar North, a UK company formerly called DMA Design.

I can't seem to find the BBC article, but they mentioned earlier this year/last year how quite a lot of British music is actually top in the US compared to their own (e.g. One Direction, Adele, etc).

true,ajehals,null,null,"&gt;tl;dr: the definition of terrorism is broad, and often just reading the Act in isolation is insufficient to get a complete picture of the landscape, as interpretation of the courts is also key to understanding what is legal and what is not.

The definition of terrorism is interesting. However it has been repeatedly defined and limited by the courts so no, you couldn't, based on the reading of anything I have seen on the subject determine that, based on what we currently know, that this would equate to terrorism or that such a claim could be defended... It could certainly fall under any number of other areas of concern, but again the act, and Schedule 7 have a fairly clear statement of intent.

One of the more clear cut ways to look at this is to look at the implications of the Samina Malik case - that again challenged some overly broad interpretations of the law as it related to terrorist material and it likely applies here.  Just because someone has acted counter to the interests of the UK, intends to or indeed might do in the future, isn't sufficient under any of the definitions of terrorism that I have seen (in the context of Irish terrorism or indeed the changed environment since then). Judges don't tend to like the abuse of terrorism powers, even if the government doesn't mind, and the police are happy with extended powers..

Of course we will probably find out exactly where the courts stand and how this should have been dealt with when a Judge looks at it (which may now happen given the potential legal action being brought by Miranda).  

But lets be absolutely clear for once:

The police stated:

*At 08:05 on Sunday, 18 August a 28-year-old man was detained at Heathrow airport under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. He was not arrested. He was subsequently released at 17:00.*

So we know he was stopped and held under schedule 7.

Now the confusion about the legitimacy of the stop appears to relate to paragraph 2(1)-(4), which limits the powers provided to a specified purpose, that of ""determining""  whether a person falls within section 40(1)(b) of the 2000 Act.  If that isn't why they are stopping someone, they the power is used illegitimately.

Then Paragraph 2(4) goes on to say that an officer may exercise his power  regardless of whether he has grounds for suspecting that a person falls within section 40(1)(b).  This means that there is no need to meet the usual reasonable suspicion criteria,  however, crucially it does not negate the requirement that the power be exercised for the purpose specified - and that is related to terrorism, not espionage, a breach of the official secrets act or anything else...

It seems, at this point, likely that the stop was not legitimate, was not used in the way the legislation was intended and, possibly most importantly, if this is deemed legitimate then we have essentially unlimited stop and search powers at the border, with no recourse, and no suspicion requirement, with no bar on politically or otherwise poorly motivated interventions... I am almost certain that this is simply not going to stand up..",0,1377016567,null,0,false,0,cbrmx2i,t3_1kq4sn,t1_cbrmx2i,t1_cbrlgmp,null,1429763334,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Now I dont agree with the authors analysis of the German political class. The politicians that get to lead go first through the Lander apparatus, and that's good I think. And every time somebody who knows how to sing beautifully to the Germans, comes along it alerts a lot of people, mostly we are talking Bavaria politicians like Guttenberg or the former German President. Germans simply prefer politicians who seem like hard workers and not populists, and that is such a holy and important part of the German political culture, and I think you would need to sacrifice that in part if you want somebody who can appear as a poet on the global stage. I mean I know the author did not probably mean that he wants a populist, but how else can you sell the people of Europe a brither future, without slipping into populism and talk about greatness, importance and superiority. Willy Brant was about unification or approachment on a state level, talking about unification on a continental level would require a different set of emotions to work.   

Also I dont think Germans fear inflation because of the WWs, but the fear is more rational and Germans simply dont want that their money loses its worth, especially after the implementation of the Euro usage.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Ten Montenegrins’ commandments:

1.      A man was born tired, and lives to rest.

2.      Kiss your bed like you kiss yourself.

3.      Rest at day that you can sleep at night.

4.      Do not work-working kills.

5.      If you see somebody resting-do help.

6.      Work less than you can, and the much you can, pass to somebody else.

7.      The salvation is in tree shades-nobody has ever died of resting.

8.      Working brings illness, do not die young.

9.      If you ever feel an urge to work: sit and wait, you will see it will pass.

10.  When see people eating and drinking-approach and help, when see them working-move away to give them space.

This statistic is to some degree an artifact of the United States' diversity--geographic, ethnic, and racial. Since people will compare themselves to their parents and peers, the perception may be more accurate than you think.

If you would calculate the income mobility for Europe as a whole, you would find much less mobility than the individual countries. Grouping Germany and Greece, for example, would give a higher number for income elasticity (and thus lower mobility) than the number for either of them separately.

In the US, by one estimate, the intergenerational income elasticity is 0.53, but for whites, separately, the elasticity is 0.39 (more mobile), and for blacks, 0.32 (still more mobile).

My definition is: a government where people can elect their representatives, and expect them to do their bidding, and a government which does not interfere in the private lives of their citizens.

&gt;EU member states do not share the same views at all on those topics, quite the contrary, they even have irreducible divergent interests

In a federation, no state shares the same views. You're pretty naive to think so. Lets look at USA[which we all like to compare the EU to]. States have different laws, different tax rates and so on.

&gt;and we can already see the catastrophic effects of the euro

What catastrophic effects of the Euro? The current crisis were *not* caused by the euro. It was caused by reckless overspending and overborrowing. 

&gt;due to the fact that a currency represents a nation

The currency does not represent a nation.

&gt;and all 17 using the common currency do not have similar economies.

I guess you are from the UK. Do you think that in the UK, all countries have similar economies? Do you think that Wales or Scotland is comparable to England? No. That ""argument"" is moot.

&gt;Giving more power to the European Parliament or having an elected president for the EU won't solve any of those problems, since they won't be able to satisfy those interests.

Yes, it would solve the goddamn problems. The problems were caused in the first place by the EP not having enough power to legislate required laws. 

&gt;Strangely enough, we're constantly showered with calls for a European Federation, the thing is they're rarely, if ever, coming from the people themselves

You're naive to think so, or have not been exposed to EU federalists.

Trends in pushing to legitimize false interpretations of historical events, like trying to say that america was somehow founded as a ""christian nation"", and whitewash modern political party's involvement in things like voter suppression and endemic racism only serve to increase the evidence supporting that idea.

However, I think the biggest thing isn't malice as much as the pursuit of power and money. Politicians and entertainment organizations like Fox simply sell people the lies they want to hear, whether it's that their religion should be imposed on everybody else due to their misconceptions about history or that [black people weren't beaten ""often"" as slaves](http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/07/photos-evangelical-curricula-louisiana-tax-dollars).",0,1377022578,null,0,false,0,cbrpgpi,t3_1kq34n,t1_cbrpgpi,t1_cbrp0sf,null,1429762086,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Yes, it is. What carrier to go with kind of depends on your area, if you need a data plan, etc. Generally, I've made good experiences with congstar and fonic, but there are even cheaper options out there (like Aldi talk, for example).

&gt;just buy some beer and go knocking on random doors in the Studentenwerk looking for someone willing to drink it with me(or if that would even be culturally acceptable). Any ideas how to fill the time?

This kind of depends on what kind of dorm you're in. If there's lots of international people (ERASMUS students etc.), you'd probably be very welcome. If it's just regular German students, don't worry - they'll immediately tell you if they're busy or if they think you're being too forward (candor being a national trait and all). As for passing time, it largely depends on where you're going. Sightseeing is an obvious option.

&gt;I know torrenting from Germany is a bad idea, but is it safe to bring some pirated music and games on a laptop? Probably a stupid question but I want to play it safe.

It's highly unlikely they'll check your computer at the airport. As for acquiring more stuff: streaming sites for movies (or porn, for that matter) are a legal gray area in the sense that currently the police is not going after the viewers, but, depending on whether you get your internet access from the university/dorm, you should use discretion, anyway.

The article further states that the effective government would be appointed by the 'prime minister' who would be elected by the parliament:

Prejudice is everywhere because people are everywhere, and you'll never get pure 100% equality because education is done by people, and people are biased. You can ask them to be professional, but that's about it. I'm willing to bet half of my fortune that they'll just come up with some more random feminist bullshit that still won't change anything and will just skew things even more, all of this obviously on the taxpayer's dime.

As for girls not choosing sciences, well tough shit, they just don't. There's not a guy standing near the application booth going ""Uh oh, a girl doing physics, now this just won't do ! Let me just throw away your file and sign you up for cooking classes instead !"". They're free to pick fucking whatever they want, they have been for decades, and as it turns out whatever they want is mostly humanities.

&gt; I am interested in everything. Work athmosphere, facilities, professional skills, supervisors...

The city is very nice in my opinion, I like Padova very much. You will have to fight a little bit with Italian bureaucracy at the beginning, but nothing too difficult. I think that all your other questions are specific to which PhD program you are in, or maybe also specific to which research group you are in.

In my case the work atmosphere is great, my PhD colleagues are great and very funny people; the facilities are good, even if I wouldn't mind a bigger office; my supervisors are just like every supervisor: sometimes they want too much, sometimes they are too busy to care about you, but on average I have a great relationship with them and I share many great ideas. But this is my experience, and that may not necessarily apply to the Psychology Department and/or to your prospective research group.

&gt; Is it difficult to find a post-doc/teaching position in italy?

It is difficult, at least in Physics, but in my opinion it is as difficult as the majority of European countries: most PhD holders won't end working in academia, that's a fact in every country, I think.

Anyway, you shouldn't regard this as a problem, because it is very common to change institution for a post-doc, actually most students are encouraged to.

Also, please note that as a foreign student you have two chances to enter into a PhD program at University of Padova. You can go through the standard admission process, through which you can obtain a scholarship, but there also some additional scholarships reserved for foreign students. Don't forget about that:

Do you have any proof that the Jews in Hungary were the biggest and most ardent supporters of the communist regime? You don't, because it's not true. I'm guessing what you actually meant to say was that Kun's government had a large number of Jews in it. That does not justify Horthy's actions. Also, the definition of communists during the Terror was quite broad and essentially all encompassing. If the state didn't like you then you were a communist and more often than not these ""communists"" were Jews. 

&gt;If it's ok to you, I am gonna translate an important part of it. Cuz most of the people judge on Horthy by being allied with the nazis, so he becames an instant evil. 

I am not judging Horthy because of his allegiance to Nazi Germany, I'd have made the same choice if I were in his shoes giving how dependent Hungary's economy was on German exports. I am judging him for his ations.

&gt;I found a nicely done writing about him, the thing about what happened at Budapest at 1944.july 5-6 with the jews it's not really detailed there, but it mentions it. You can read about Horthy who was he really, and not what the communist propaganda told him about. As Hungarian-born professor István Deák has written: “Horthy was not a monster, but was not a humanitarian either.”
Here is the link: click :D

A blog article written by a biased person with dubious credentials is not what I'd call a very good source.

Les africains ne méritent certainement pas leur sort et leur fournir un service clé en main de distribution de nourriture ne va pas aider, c'est une solution temporaire, ça masque pour un temps. Une population excessive est un des maux. Les pays d'Afrique souffrent beaucoup des ravages du VIH, peut-être qu'un accompagnement dans la gestion de la population et leur éducation devrait davantage être une priorité que d'envoyer des sacs de riz et de les laisser se débrouiller.

Mr. Paul Pato (Pató Pál úr) written by Sándor Petőfi, translated by Arlo Voorhees (It sound much better in hungarian)

Like a cursed prince cast out

far from the fairy tale seas,

Mr. Paul Pato sits at home

by himself in habitual misery.

How different his life might be

if he could meet a promising girl!

But Mr. Paul Pato interjects,

“I have all the time in the world.”


The house is close to collapsing

and littered with flakes of plaster;

the wind takes a piece of the roof

and scatters it Godknowswhere.

He should fix it now, for soon the sky

will be gazing through the ceiling boards.

But Mr. Paul Pato interjects,

“I have all the time in the world.”


Instead of the harvest’s usual yield,

poppies fill the furrowed earth—

all different kinds in every field

while the garden lies deserted.

How odd they seem, these idle workers,

how useless the plots no longer plowed!

But Mr. Paul Pato interjects,

“I have all the time in the world.”


The cloak too, and even the trousers—

old and tattered, and only useful for

(if necessity called for it)

a replacement screen for the door!

You simply need to call the tailor;

The cloth’s already ordered.

But Mr. Paul Pato interjects,

“I have all the time in the world.”


His life, it seems, is hardly lived;

though his forefathers left him

with quite a lot, alone he sits

endowed with next to nothing;

But Mr. Paul Pato is not to blame,

for Hungarians are bound to uphold

their ancestors’ favored  phrase,

“I have all the time in the world.”

So *maybe* it works differently.

About the part on doing the PhD program in English, I didn't exclude it, but again I think it depends on the department. Departments dealing with so-called ""exact"" sciences (like yours, I assume) are usually more open to English than the others.

That's nice (and I mean it), but usually when I used to study there I had a hard time getting responses from offices, so unfortunately I was talking out of experience.

true,JimmyNic,ENGL,England,"&gt; As for Englishness being closer to Germanness and Americanness, I would argue for our European neighbours.

You'd be wrong, but you could certainly argue it.

&gt; The American culture is one of a whole multitude of different cultures, their nation and history was founded through that of many different countries and their people fleeing the ""Old Countries"", those who never saw and agreed with the European ideals of the old times. European culture and history is older, richer and more intertwined with one another. This has lead to a greater exchange maybe more than you can see. Europe has had many conflicts, trade agreements and the languages have influenced each other.

I wouldn't debate the diversity of American culture, but there is a disparity between how a country is and how it is perceived, and in America's case the international image is more English than not. That's a simple point of observation.

&gt;Taking another sentence you wrote and rewording it. Europe and the UK are geographically so close to one another compared to states such as NZ, Australia and the US that they shouldn't be considered foreign.

It's a cultural point rather than a geographical one. You don't seem to grasp the distinction.

&gt; Many of us have a language in common, whether French, English or German, spoken by the majority of the EU. 

The British record on bilingualism leaves much to be desired when compared to the rest of the continent. Indeed this is a major obstacle in European integration. In comparison I have access to the overwhelming majority of American literature, films, and newspapers, without having to hit up Google Translate. Language is an important point of overlap that Europe cannot provide an alternative to.

&gt; Our legal systems are not allowed to contradict one another to the point that it goes against EU legislation, we also can all get our voices heard by the same legal framework at the European courts. 

And yet the British establishment has continually underplayed the fact that Britain essentially no longer has supreme legislative power. What does that tell you about public attitude to this idea?

&gt; We have historical figures who are also common to us all whether Henry the 8th, Charlemagne or Hitler these people all influenced over their current ""national"" borders. Our heads of states may not be the same, they act similar and many of them are related to one another and have family in other European countries.

Charlemagne and Hitler are not common to Europe and Britain in the sense that Churchill is common to both the English and American traditions. Your comparison is spurious.

Of course it depends a lot on what you like, but here's a list of a few things.

Bars/Restaurants:

* La Uva Jumillana https://www.facebook.com/lauvajumillana Mostly ""typical"" wines, but have beer, sodas,... With each one comes a ""tapa"" (small dish), try ""Bienmesabe / Cazón"" (shark) or ""callos"". Wine/beer is 1.80€ (In front of it, they have another bar -same owner- but different style, try it to)

* El Viejo Almacén http://www.rutadelatapadecartagena.es/comercio/ubicacion/el-viejo-almacen/10 Beer + tapa is/was 1.60€ (you can not choose the tapa)

* Pintxorela or Sabor andaluz, are also cheap places for tapas (near Icue)

* Rincón gallego (excellent seafood) a bit more expensive, it's located in ""C/Cañon , 13""


To visit:

* ARQUA (located in the port http://museoarqua.mcu.es/ ) is the National museum of subaquatic arqueology, I'm not sure if they have the coins/gold from the Odyssey yet or not, but it's that place. Free on saturdays after 14.00 and sundays

* Teatro Romano ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_romano_de_Cartagena ), the entrance is located near ""Heroes de Cavite"" (port) in front of ""Palacio Consistorial"" (old town council)

* Foro Romano en el Molinete ( http://www.cartagenapuertodeculturas.com/publicas/que_visitar/historia_fororomano_molinete/_rpder9a8G1a2nEdguRAsjw ) better if you go with a guide, they have schedules and do guided visited

* See the ""first electric battery powered submarine"" at museo naval (at the port)

* Once you have a car, go to ""Batería de Castillitos"" or ""Batería de Cenizas"", very nice places (old abandoned military fortress, to ""Cenizas"" you need to walk maybe 1 hour, Castillitos you could go with the car to the same door).

* This could be nice to see : http://www.parqueminerodelaunion.es/es/ (for me it was a ""meh"" because I already know about it



Here's another interesting website : http://www.cartagenapuertodeculturas.com/ it's the company (private) that runs most of the museums and tourist places here

I tried to imagine how I would have felt if I was in your child's place, and I have some concerns about this.

First, unless the child will have to deal with the Italian language anyway, it looks to me (and it's just my opinion) like an imposition, like making him/her catholic or (if he's a boy obviously) circumcizing him without a choice.

Second, if s/he won't have the chance of practicing Italian with anyone else, I doubt it will be useful and it will be forgotten soon, as it happened to a friend of mine who spent the first years of his life in the U.S. and, after his family came back to Italy, he had to re-learn English when he grew older, because meanwhile he had forgotten it.

If you don't know Italian, s/he will only be exposed to TV shows/movies and his/her only approach to the language would be a passive competence, thus not helping much for your cause.

If you accept some advice from someone who has learned four foreign languages (I know it looks like I'm boasting, but I just want to point out that I presume to know something about learning new languages) I would stick with focusing on English and Spanish, that you and your wife know well so that you can correct him/her, and then letting your child learn Italian when (if) he/she wants.

That way it will be more natural and spontaneous and not ""forcing"" him/her to watch movies in Italian, and plus you will be able to watch TV together with him/her.

If the child will choose to learn Italian, s/he will have two advantages: one is that, by growing up bilingual, s/he will find easier to learn a new language anyway; the second is that, since Spanish will be one of his/her native tongues, Italian will be even easier to learn, when and if he/she wants.

My two cents.

Usually in Italy you speak Italian. In every sector. Not because we are some nationalistic country but because a lot of people don't speak English well. If you learn Italian (at least a bit; curse words are a good step forward :D) and speak English you won't have problems. Most people are nice and helpful and'll try their best to help you. 
A master degree is very good and you'll get a job for sure. If you have English knowledge and you are good in your sector people won't hesitate to hire you.   
Discrimination: it's present however I would say it's superficial. Italians aren't racist but I bet there are a lot of people with (initial) stereotypes. You have to realize that especially in south Italy we have huge problems with illegal immigrants. But if they realize that you are legally there and that you are eager (and allowed) to work I bet they will welcome you asap.
Internships in Italy are nearly non existent. Expect an oldschool type of thinking in companies. I wouldn't say that they don't know this type of employing but it's rather uncommon. But asking for an internship and explaning what you want to do will give you a place. But expect to not get payed however it is probably more likely to get hired after an internship here than in other companies because it's so uncommon. 
They can get you more quickly into your desired career but I don't think that they be especially useful. Most companies will higher regarding your experience than looking on an impressive curriculum. That's why our society is so fucked up at the moment. 
Hope that it's still relevant to you.

Due napoletani, Ciro e Antonio, dopo aver speso tutti i soldi nella grande Milano si ritrovano con il problema di come tornare a casa! Decidono allora di separarsi per un momento e chiedere l'elemosina onde racimolare la cifra necessaria per far ritorno nella loro calda Napoli. Si danno perciò appuntamento alla stazione di Milano nel giro di un'oretta. Dopo un'ora, i due si ritrovano e Ciro chiede ad Antonio come gli sia andata. Antonio risponde: Cirù, è proprio vero... i settentrionali sono gente fredda... pensa un po', mi sono camuffato per bene da povero cieco e mi son messo a Piazza Duomo con un cartello con sù scritto ""POVERO CIECO HA FAME"" e nonostante tutto ho racimolato solo 11 euro. A te invece com'è andata?
E Ciro: Ho raccolto tremila euro...
Antonio rimane allibito ed esclama: E come hai fatto?
Ciro con molta calma glielo spiega: Semplice Toni'... sono rimasto qui in stazione, ho preso un pezzo di carta e con una matita ho scritto: ""POVERO MERIDIONALE VUOLE TORNARE A CASA!""

Un giorno a Milano entrano in un bar un milanese, un napoletano e un senegalese. Ordinano un caffè e, mentre aspettano, uno di loro rovescia la zuccheriera. I tre fanno per raccoglierla, ma da essa magicamente ne esce un genio: Sono il genio della zuccheriera, avete un desiderio a testa. Chiedetemi qualsiasi cosa e sarete esauditi! Dopo lo stupore iniziale, si fa subito avanti il napoletano: Io voglio diventare ricco per poter tornare a Napoli. Anzi vorrei che tutti i meridionali potessero essere benestanti, in modo da ritornare nella propria terra senza dover stare qui ed essere insultati dalla gente del Nord.
Detto fatto il napoletano sparisce e con lui tutti i meridionali presenti al Nord. Subito dopo si fa vivo il senegalese:
Anch'io voglio che tutta la gente Africana possa stare bene, tornare in Africa e non subire le umiliazioni che subisce qui. Anche lui immediatamente viene accontentato. A questo punto toccherebbe al milanese, e il genio gli chiede: E tu, cosa vorresti? Con un sospiro lui risponde: Mah, vista la situaziun...mi saria a post insci', fam un cafè!

true,thatfool,EURO,European Union,"The simple matter of the fact is that exit from nuclear was already planned before Fukushima. We expected to be done with nuclear power around 2021 because a law from 2002 made building new plants illegal and limited the amount of power that the existing ones were allowed to produce until they would have to be shut down. By 2010 they'd used up more than half of that budget. Then in December 2010, the government extended the deadlines by up to 14 years, which turned out to be a very bad idea almost immediately (March 2011, as you know). Popular opposition against nuclear was already strong anyway, and two months after Fukushima, we got our first ever Green Minister-President in a state that had never not been ruled by the CDU (Mrs Merkel's party) before. 

They took those delays back and ordered the oldest reactors permanently shut down later in 2011. Hardly a knee-jerk reaction; we still expect to be done with nuclear power around 2021 or 2022 so they didn't even accelerate the process.

If you´re lucky, you get a small appartment for yourself or at least a room in a shared appartment with 3 to 4 other guys for about 260€ per month.",0,1377034759,null,0,false,0,cbruhhz,t3_1kq7qy,t1_cbruhhz,t3_1kq7qy,null,1429759670,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The company is quite popular among German students and a lot of students can call those numbers for free... They even have a plan that's 0€/month, you only pay for the minutes you use.

2. German dorms are pretty social. Here's some advice to make the most of it:

Keep your door open whenever you're in the mood for social interaction. People will stop by. Spend time in the common room, cooking, watching TV, whatever. In dorms with large corridors (&gt;8 people), there's usually a core group that organizes shit and introduces new people (or at least one person with that task). Find out who that is, they'll show you how things work.

Introduce yourself to every one you meet in the dorm with a smile and a handshake, say your name and where you're from and what you study. Ask which room they live in and what they study.

The best way: Cook a welcome dinner. Better ask sombody on the corridor when the best timeslot for that would be (likely second week of classes, tuesday or thursday night). Hang a letter on the kitchen door (and maybe even the toilets, facing the seat) that you intend to have a Welcome-Dinner with some food from your home country. Add a list for people to sign up with something they can bring to the party (ask for donations in liquid form if your are so inclined). This allows you to plan a bit and learn the names of people. Go shopping at ALDI, except for beer if you buy some yourself (Germans are picky).

If you're in for the hard ride, there might even be a tour-de-chambre (every room serves a drink, the whole corridor goes from room to room and drinks).

Hang a sign on your door with your name. And possibly your countries flag, so people can place you. Again, keep the door open if you aren't sleepign, naked, masturbating or studying.

The size of the dorm only matters for large dorm-parties, otherwise it's the amount of the people you share a kitchen with, as this is the core group of people you'll interact with on a daily basis.

About the data: Truecrypt is your friend. Also, dorms have ways...

As a general rule: If somebody in your dorm greets you with a smile and a hands


About the orientation week: Prepare for large amounts of alcohol. Try to memorize names and faces. Participate in as many activities you can, even if they are slightly embarrasing. Remember: This is a blank sheet. Nobody knows anyone. Chat people up. You're foreign, so you're interesting anways.


Oh and for the 1.5k, get a bike.


Concerning the dorms: There is usually a person or a core group of people that knows how things run in the dorm. If they find you (remember, introduce yourself to everyone, even if that means knocking on doors), they will introduce you to the rules and how things work. Listen. When in doubt, ask.
If you are lucky and live on a social corridor, any problem you might have, ranging from ""i've got toothache/diarrhea/hangover/..."" to ""my girlfriend left me"" are fine to talk about.

If your dorm is mostly empty and you don't have any social contacts whatsoever (I don't assume this will happen), wander around the city, figure out where the shops (Aldi for general needs, REWE/Edeka for more fancy stuff) are, get a bike and/or public transport ""Semesterticket"", figure out the best way to get to the Uni.
Most importantly, spend time in the common room and expose yourself to people. Given that you're in Brandenburg, you might want to take a short trip to Berlin aswell.",0,1377034849,null,0,false,0,cbruirj,t3_1kqxjl,t1_cbruirj,t3_1kqxjl,null,1429759654,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

Obviously I don't know the specifics of how the Spanish system works, so I am giving a generic answer (although influenced by what I see in Greece and Cyprus on the same issue). 

&gt; This has obvious effects. Spain has an increasing number of malnourished children.. Parents are scared of losing them if they ask for help. Because that can happen.

See, that's a problem the first option entails. The way it tries to help creates a sense of ""punishment"" towards the parents who honestly love their children and aren't abusive, they became poor. But taking one's kid away is a measure taken against abusive parents. If you treat them as abusers, of course they will be reluctant to seek help for their children. (not dissimilar to Greece's ""arrest first, test for HIV and then release them"" law. Has the same effect, treating a vulnerable person as a criminal ""because you want to help"", will only make them more isolated, and that will hurt themselves (not have food for their children / remain ignorant of their HIV status) and that hurts the society too).",0,1377037996,null,0,false,0,cbrvp9h,t3_1kra7i,t1_cbrvp9h,t1_cbrve9n,null,1429759103,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Appearances are important. Perhaps more important than realities in some respects.

&gt; The US is becoming less and less ""English"" if you want to put it that way. The increase in Hispanics and people of Asian origin is changing that country. Simple observation, go to Florida or Texas, as two example, and tell me how English those places are! Sure you maybe able to get round with English but there are many places which sure as don't feel like an English speaking area.

By the end of this century the US will have changed inexorably, I don't doubt. We aren't talking about then, we are talking about now. The fact that there are regions of the US dominated by Spanish does little to undercut the thrust of my point, and I could easily respond by noting the plethora of tongues on the European continent. 

&gt; As for bilingualism, stop lumping Britain together, the English level of Bilingualism is atrocious don't go lumping Wales and Scotland with England, they still have their national tongues being taught.

If you are using this as an example of European integration then you really are scraping the barrel of your argument.

**The city itself**

To be honest, I haven't spend that much time in the capital, so I can't give you much information on it.


* There's this ass-huge statue, called the ""Monumento a la Fe Descubridora"" (though people commonly mistake it for the Colon Statue, which is another trademark of the city). It was designed by the same artist who founded the famous Whitney Musem in New York. It feels a bit Art-Decoish and Cubist to me, by which I mean hard-lined and ominous. It is in the outskirts of the city, right in the middle of nowhere and looking over the sea inlet, which makes it all the more incredible. To me it feels like reaching an area left deserted by some mankind-wiping disaster and walking across the last, magnificent remains of some bygone civilzation... But I digress. http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monumento_a_la_Fe_Descubridora


- I'm aware that there's an ""English neighbourhood"" consisting of the houses of those involved in the British Río Tinto Company Limited (that operated in the mines in the Río Tinto). I've never been there myself but it looks really nice. http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrio_Reina_Victoria 
- If you're into football it's compulsory for you to go to the Recreativo de Huelva Stadium. Recreativo aren't faring that well in La Liga, but they're the oldest team in Spain, due to British influence. They've got a rather nice history and if you're interested in it you should look them up.
- The harbour in itself is amazing enough. Gritty and busy and huge and shit.
- Quite near is the village of Niebla, boasting a medieval castle and market. Really really nice.
- If you're in the mood for a bit of Spanish old-flavoured nationalism, head to Palos de la Frontera, the place of origin of the ships with which Columbus discovered America. Most interesting is the Monasterio de la Rábida. Feels very Andalusian, the museum is quite good. Columbus stayed there too, for a couple of years. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_R%C3%A1bida_Friary

That's all I can really tell you about the city. I could ask my mother or my aunt, who lives in the village the whole year, If you wish.
Then there is [this really nice video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ6eL9jlu0Q). Mind you, the city is uglier as they make it out to be :) I don't recognize all trademarks, so you'll have to ask your way to those.

You should also be aware that there is a huge chemical processing area nearby and they dispose of their waste just outside the city. If you look it up on Google Maps, you'll see a whitish blotch surrounding some kind of tiered enclosures. Both are where the shit's at. Both the chemical plants and the disposal area have been linked with an increase in cancer cases. Just so you know. No, I don't think it will harm you no matter how near you may be to this area. I tell you just for the sake of information. It hasn't been that much reported in the media, I don't know if that's a good or a bad sign.

On the rest of the region:

**North** - The Sierra de Aracena Natural Park is a must, as is the village of Jabugo, home to the best iberico ham you will ever taste.

**Southeast**

* Doñana. GO SEE IT.
- Almonte/El Rocío. Home to the most ass-crazy pilgrimage in the country. St. James doesn't even come close. Wide range of kitsch souvenirs there. Make sure to at least buy a decorated dish with the famous ""Estuve en El Rocío y me acordé de ti"". Typical Spanish goodness.

**Southwest**

* Villablanca and Cartaya - Only thing I can remember is that the food there is fucking good and they're both nice-looking villages.

* Lepe - Boooooring. I'm sure you know the jokes. Well real people from Lepe lack anything mildly resembling humour. Nothing to see here, and if there is, I hope someone corrects me.

* Isla Cristina - A rather regular town and people from my village loathe them, but they've got one nice beach (Punta del Caimán) and beautiful marismas and fishermen scenery. Stinks of fish. They've got also a beautiful religious feast for Virgen del Carmen, who protects fishing business and fishermen, but I don't know if you'll be around to see it.
* La Redondela - My village. Rather bland and boring, but I can recommend you a bar called ""Bichito Luz"". May be boring outside of the holiday season. There's another place with real good food and a nice backyard terrace, but I don't remember the name, it's located in the calle San Sebastián.
The town hall is built on or around an original mudéjar style room that is open to anyone.
The church is also an antiquity of sorts, but you aren't really missing anything.
The true highlights of the area are the **vía verde** (a repurposed train line that once served my village and nearby ones from Huelva to Ayamonte but was decomissioned thirty years ago), which makes for a great ride (it's a really tranquil and mysterious place, but I wouldn't like to be there when it gets dark), and the **Palomar de la Huerta Noble**.
The second biggest dovecote in Europe, a rare example of Baroque civil architecture, does feel out of place in the middle of dull farming land. It's huuuuuge and absolutely astonishing, but it is in a terrible state of disrepair because the authorities can't be bothered. You need to go there, even if it is as depressing as it is interesting. The whole complex (known as Huerta Noble) includes the ruins of a chapel and the residence of the man who comissioned the buildings and is on privately owned land, but the people from the agricultural business there don't mind you entering and they'll even give you directions to the dovecote itself. There used to be a rare group of Dutch tiles depicting the Via Crucis, but they were removed, restored and are now in the Archeological Museum of Huelva. [There you go](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BuxhF14LpNg/TcZ0ge-yLwI/AAAAAAAAAEA/l7ulO0d2Bb0/s1600/P7.jpg).
- Ayamonte: my absolute favourite place in the region. A beautiful Andalusian town on the Guadiana river that is the effective border with Portugal. On the high area you'll find typical Southern Spain houses lining very steeped and narrow streets (it requires a lot of dexterity to actually park there). Walk down to the seaside area and you'll find quaint squares and atmospheric restaurants. Really good food. Beautiful port and sea inlet. At night, looking over the marina towards the west you can see the blinking from the lighthouse in the Portuguese city of Faro. Great for a nice walk and for eating out and chill at night.

Overall in Huelva there is a lot of interesting wildlife, but I don't know much about it, so you'll have to look elsewhere.

**Beaches**

I'm sparing you the pain of crowded and commercialized, touristy beaches and show you the real deal:

* Doñana area: especially Mazagón, which is a not-so-stranded town and you should be able to get there with a variety of mediums of transport.
* Playa Cruce de la Redondela: I know I'm divulging a well-kept secret here, but still... This one is semi-virgin, it has well-preserved dunes, white sand, lifeguards and a great, great chiringuito with really nice dudes that's open year-round. You enter through eucalyptus trees which make for quite a scenic entrance. There's also a small chapel hidden there, only open once a year. When the tide is high and the waters are tranquil, it is like bathing in a natural pool.
* Playa de la Casita Azul: next to the previous one, you get basically the same deal there, minus eucalyptus and chapel. I can't vouch for the friendliness of their chiringuito, though.
* Isla Canela (Ayamonte): also nice if you manage to go to the less populated corners, which can be a bit difficult.
And I think that's all the beach information you need.

**Eat**
Ham and seafood. Duh.

* Chocos (cuttlefish): you absolutely NEED to taste these.
* Coquinas (small clams): these are delicious, especially in the way they prepare them here. In the villages on the coast women actually sell them door by door, but you can ""catch"" them yourself: they live on the edge of the shore, you just dig a bit with your feet in the wet sand and they surface. Mind you, you're not supposed to pick the real small ones.
- Ham. A must, an absolute must. Being Spanish I can't stand any type of Serrano ham because I was raised on the Jabugo sort (which is Iberico, not Serrano). That's the real deal. I guess that makes me some kind of ham snob.
- Fresones: that's right, huge strawberries. I don't like strawberries, so I can't tell if they're that good, but aparently they're flavourless when compared with regular, smaller strawberries.
- Montadito de lomo: right, a pork sandwich with garlic-herb sauce. Chiringuito food all the way.
- Mojama: dried tuna. Me doesn't like, but it's fairly typical.
- Camarones: tiny, transparent shrimp. I know people catch them in places like Isla Cristina, but I don't know the method.
- Ice cream: surprisingly, and I don't know exactly why, there have been ice cream parlors opened by people from the Spanish Levante for years in the touristy village of La Antilla. This ice cream recipe is up there with the Italian one.

**Culture**

* [Fandango](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USmEZQBFCow).

* [South Pop Festival](http://www.southpopfestival.com/index.php): I don't know if you'll be in time to attend it, but Dorian, Delafé y las Flores Azules and L.A. are three of the best Spanish groups.
* [Tartessos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartessos)

* Be also sure to check some village religious feasts, they're quite flavourful.

**Language**
You're lucky you speak some Spanish, because English abilities among the people from Huelva are severely lacking :D

**Transportation**
Train: to Seville and nearby cities, or even to Madrid.
Bus: Damas service around the region.

In true Orwellian fashion, the Party deemed the term Kulak to be no longer just a designation for a social class, but was a ""state of mind"". Most of the kulaks were shipped off to the Gulags, where they were worked to death. Those that were allowed to stay had their property and animals confiscated, became collective farmers alongside their poorer neighbors, and together, they perished from starvation while Stalin exported grain to accrue the resources to develop heavy industry. As people succumbed to starvation, their families had to guard the graves to prevent others from cannibalizing the corpses.
