Yes, i know. It really angers me to see people who don't know what they are talking about and getting upvoted.

&gt; To a lesser extent that is why I am not too worried about France. The ECB does not only serve France so action can not be guaranteed, but given its recent bond buying programs directed at struggling Eurozone countries its pretty clear the ECB will take action to prevent defaults. Especially if France got into trouble I have no doubt the ECB would go on a French bond buying spree.

True, the U.K's debt is also not a problem as they only pay interest, just as the U.S debt. People said that noone would buy U.K debt when they made a law against cashing it out.

For example one of the biggest annoying factor for me is how International and European media shows Turkey with only images of mosque, very crowded old bazaars and such.

true,peggy_olson_draper,null,null,"La suite de la TL de Mme Déjantée:

Z'êtes prêt-e-s pour la suite de la lecture du #dicodesfilles2014 ?

Donc petit retour sur l'article ""grossesse précoce"" que j'avais sauté hier ""La jeune fille peut choisir de mener cette grossesse à terme, c'est un engagement de longue durée, qui transforme toute une vie mais qui n'est pas impossible si on est bien entourée [...] elle peut aussi confier le bébé à l'adoption [mais] ce n'est pas forcément une décision facile à tenir quand on sentira son bébé grandir en soi et qu'on le découvrira à la naissance."" Observez maintenant le changement de registre: #dicodesfilles2014  ""si après avoir examiné toutes les solutions possibles la jeune fille décide de ne pas mener à terme cette grossesse, il lui faudra recourir à l'avortement. C'est une décision grave et forcément douloureuse: même quand on ne se sent pas capable d'élever un enfant, on a au fond de soi un désir de vie. Désolée pour cette suite un peu longue mais le contraste est saisissant: comme si garder un enfant n'était ni douloureux, ni grave...

Honteuse erreur à l'article ""majorité"" ""une jeune fille qui se marie avant 18 ans (avec l'autorisation de ses parents) est automatiquement émancipée"" -&gt; Depuis 2006 personne ne peut se marier av 18 ans, mê avec autorisation des parents (sauf cas graves.) Par ""cas graves"", on entend en général ""grossesse"", mais pour le #dicodesfilles2014 ce n'est pas grave souvenons nous.

Petit clin d'oeil à mes ami-e-s qui luttent contre les violences éducatives ordinaires à l'article ""maltraitance"": ""il peut arriver sous le coup de l'exaspération que vos parents laissent partir une gifle ou un coup de pied [..] Ces choses arrivent dans bcp de familles et cela n'a rien à voir avec de la maltraitance""

Déposons nos neurones pour entrer dans la section ""maquillage""  #dicodesfilles2014 ""Reste à apprendre à utiliser tous ces produits merveilleux qui vous font rêver, à marier les couleurs en fonction de votre visage, de vos yeux, de vos cheveux. [...]Rien ne remplace les séances de maquillage dans la salle de bains avec les copines quand on partage produits, secrets et fous rires"". Suite de la frivolité ""Bébé, vous aviez la peau dont toutes les femmes rêvent, une ""peau de bébé"" douce, lisse, fraîche"". C'est vrai que l'idéal féminin c'est quand même de rester enfant, c'est pas faute de nous le répéter.

Petit fou rire à la section ""Piercing"" #dicodesfilles2014 ""Dans notre société, EN DEHORS DU TROU DANS LE LOBE DE L'OREILLE, le piercing n'a rien d'une coutume ancestrale que l'on respecte. C'est une effraction volontaire du corps.""

A propos de la pilule contraceptive #dicodesfilles2014 ""ce choix de FILLE, personne ne peut le faire à votre place, ni votre mère ni le garçon que vous aimez"". Pourquoi n'ais-je pas le sentiment qu'ils parlent de respect du choix mais juste du fait que la contraception ne doit pas être l'affaire des hommes??

Je ne me remets pas de la section ""Poils"" #dicodesfilles2014  ""En France, l'usage veux qu'on s'épile. Les gens seraient CHOQUES  de vous voir avec des poils sous les aisselles: c'est supposé être très laid. En fait, cela peut donner l'impression qu'une femme ne prend pas soin d'elle ou PIRE, qu'elle est SALE"". L'épilation est donc une affaire d'identité nationale. A quand les apéros cire chaude et pinard?

Section ""pornographie"" #dicodesfilles2014  : ""Les filles sont bcp - tentées que les garçons par la pornographie. Vous faites probablement partie de celles que cela dégoûte"" #suggestioninnocente

Allez, hauts les coeurs section ""premier rapport sexuel"" #dicodesfilles2014 : ""La pénétration peut être un peu douloureuse mais si on éprouve un grand désir cette douleur n'est pas très importante"" #avisacellesquienontchié. ""Quand le moment sera venu, essayez de mettre toutes les chances de votre côté pour que cela se passe le mieux possible. Vous vous souviendrez de ce moment toute votre vie, autant que ce soit un joli souvenir"". #dicodesfilles2014 #bonjourlapression 

Selon le #dicodesfilles2014 ""Le cancer du col de l'utérus: il peut affecter les femmes dès la puberté, à partir du moment où elles ont rapports sexuels"". Je ne voudrais pas dire d'âneries mais un cancer ne se développe pas dans les 5 min qui suivent le coït...Un doc pour confirmer? (@MmeDejantee Je confirme. Même avec une infection avérée à HPV dès le 1er rapport, faudrait bien deux décennies.)

Section ""Pudeur"" #dicodesfilles2014 : ""Si vous montrer nue ne vous pose aucun problème n'oubliez pas que vous voir dans votre plus simple appareil peut gêner les autres, surtout depuis que vous êtes une grande. Soyez délicate: pensez à votre père, à vos frères, ..."" après ils parlent aussi des ""autres filles de la maison"" mais je ne sais pas pourquoi, le sous entendu de cette phrase me dérange. (mettre en avant le fait qu'elles dérangent potentiellement les autres alors que c'est déjà dur de se sentir bien dans son corps).

A propos de la survenue des 1ères règles #dicodesfilles2014 ""Vous êtes parfois un peu déçue: vous vous demandez pourquoi les filles qui en parlaient[...] avaient l'air si fière.[...] vous sentez bien aussi que c'est un moment important: vous devenez grande, il y a la promesse des enfants que vous aurez peut être plus tard"" #lafemmereproductrice.  ""Dans certains pays, on fait une fête à cette occasion pour introduire la jeune fille dans le groupe des femmes. [...] Chez nous, on est bcp plus discret, souvent on n'en parle pas, et surtout pas à ses frères ou à son père."" #fear

Et j'arrive donc à la tant attendue section ""sexe"" #dicodesfilles2014 : ""L""acte sexuel commence par des préludes amoureux qui permettent aux deux partenaires de parvenir au comble de l'excitation. PUIS à lieu la pénétration du pénis. [...]L'homme éprouve du plaisir par le mouvement de va-et-vient qu'il exerce et qui aboutit naturellement[...]à l'éjaculation qui TERMINE l'acte sexuel"" C'est moi qui souligne bien entendu. #TP ce qu'il y a de drôle c'est qui nous disent juste avant que le sesque c'est pas du tout aussi compliqué que dans le Kama Sûtra #etpourcause #phallocentrisme #coïtocentrisme. Alors pour ce qui concerne le plaisir de la femme #dicodesfilles2014 :""La femme éprouve un plaisir plus ou moins intense,essentiellement par l'excitation du clitoris sur lequel le corps et le sexe de son partenaire exercent une pression, des frottements pdt le rapport"" Surtout surtout surtout n'allez pas y mettre les doigts hein. Pour ceux-lles qui posaient la question:""masturbation"", ""fellation"",""cunnilingus"" ""sodomie"" sont définis en 2 mots, mais signalés quand même. (@MmeDejantee et je suppose qu'ils disent que c'est contre-nature #facepalm--&gt;Retour à Mme déjantée: pour fellation et cunni ils disent que ça peut choquer mais que ça peut plaire aussi. \o/ par contre sodomie oui, pour eux c'est une légende.)

Fou rire sur la masturbation #dicodesfilles2014 ""Autrefois, les adultes cherchaient à en dissuader les jeunes en affirmant que cela rend sourd! Même si aujourd'hui plus personne n'utilise ce pauvre argument, il y a quelque chose à tirer de cette histoire: c'est vrai qu'une pratique assidue de la masturbation rend [...] ""sourd""... aux autres. Cela reste une expérience pauvre. ""

1. If company's target audience is in certain country, moving away from that country might well cause an backlash.

2. There are more to country than taxrate. Such as location (are there many other companies of the same or limited field around - important for business and recruiting experienced people), imago (good luck selling your clothes as haute couture or your makeup as the best in the world when you're located in Poland) and business friendliness (eg. how willing the local area is to suggestions and improvements, such as training specialists, giving special permits, helping untangling legal constraints etc.). Logistics may also be important. If your enterprise is dependant on a good position in crossroads (for example, on the cargo coming into Rotterdamn), situating your headquarters means that you are severing your connection to the heart of your operation (also means that you may not notice if your customers are starting to get upset).

3. The taxes are what they are to keep the country standing. The company is dependant on the country's infrastructure, schooled people etc. and most of all, their consumers. Why shouldn't money made in country be taxed in said country? 

But last, it boils down to society, which companies are part of, as are their employees and customers. Just coldly playing countries against each other and min/maxing all stats might work on short term but it does wear on the goodwill.

Because there are many smaller fragmented funds the figure doesnt seem as impressive as seeing the figure for Norway.

-San Bernardino alle Ossa: I don't want to spoil the fun of this church, but if you go to the mini chapel on the right-hand side after entering, you will see something you will not be able to unsee (FREE).

-The Bicocca Hanger has a killer video installation until the 17th called The Visitors. It is a multi-sensory 30 folk video featuring musicians from Sigur Ros and Mum (FREE).

-I heard the monumental cemetery is the Italian equivalent to that Soviet Statue Park from Goldeneye (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimitero_Monumentale_di_Milano).

-Food-wise there is an outstanding restaurant called Taverna Romana. It doesn't have a website but it sits near the intersection of Viale Premuda and Via Archimede. Menu changes daily but the quality is heavenly (30 EUR average for a full dinner).

I could get more specific or give more suggestions (especially on museums. Just give me a bit more detail on what you're into.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; 1) Were you and other Swedes aware of the comments that your Culture Minister made in Africa and if so, was there an outcry of any sort?

That seems to be a quote from the minister of finance, not the minister of culture. He's good at finances, so I don't think anyone really cares what he says about anything else.

&gt; 2) The Swedish media has engaged in a concerted campaign to brand the Swedish Democrats as racist. How successful have they been?

Hard to say, but they seem to be steadily gaining support in all opinion polls. I wouldn't be surprised if they reach 10% in the election next year.

&gt; 3) Do you and your fellow Swedish residents of Malmo fear going into immigrant neighborhoods? Do you have frequent interactions with Muslim immigrants?

The immigrant neighborhoods aren't really located in places that you'd normally pass through, so you don't really have to avoid them. I live near Möllevången, so I meet a lot of immigrants, but the ones living around here are generally the more integrated ones.

&gt; 4) We've heard reports that police, ambulances and firemen are often attacked with rocks and bottles by Muslim immigrants when they are needed in Rosengard. Is this true?

It has happened on numerous occasions, yes. Mostly kids and teenagers. That obviously doesn't excuse their behavior, but it's worth noting. There aren't any mobs of angry people, just gangs of unruly teenagers.

&gt; 5) Is the average Swede aware that Sweden has become one of the rape capitals of the world?

The current Swedish legal definition of ""rape"" is wider than pretty much anywhere else, so statistics are not directly comparable to those for other countries. Statistics will be highly misleading in this case.

&gt; 6) Considering Sweden has one of the most liberal immigration policies on the Continent, are you concerned for the future of your country?

Hard to really say. The main problem used to be that there was no debate at all on the subject, but SD being voted into parliament three years ago made it much harder for media to just ignore the question.

true,Futski,DENK,Kongeriget Danmark,"&gt;Even more unrelated, there's a kind of frustration among Icelanders at not being able to articulate themselves more clearly in Danish. We actually learn Danish for 5 years in the school system and can read and write it just fine, but as soon as we step off a plane at Kastrup and ask whatever question the answer is usually ""Hvad?"". 

Yeah, I have heard Jón Gnarr express some of that frustration. In my opinion, it's just laziness on our behalf. Another example would be Aron Jóhannsson, who lived in Aarhus for 3 years, but never gave an interview in Danish, because he didn't feel he was good enough.

If only we had held dialects in as high regard, as they have in Norway, more people would have been used to the situation, where someone would speak vastly different from oneself, and therefore less likely just to give up.

I think it's nothing short of rude of us, not to try our very best to understand. You are taught it for 5 years, the very least we can do, is to listen carefully.  

&gt;but the way Danish is spoken on the streets of Copenhagen is quite a different beast.

Tell me about it. For me, as a Jyde, it sounds so stressed. But I don't know if you would consider my regional variant clearer than Lavkøbenhavnsk. Mine is something like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVrI1BkfwI).

true,Dr_Gage,4,San Bernardo,"You should follow [http://instagram.com/madridstreetartproject#](http://instagram.com/madridstreetartproject#) they even give tours on some weekends around malasaña and lavapies. 

Places to eat:

Bar iberia, glorieta de ruiz jimenez, metro sanbernardo. It's where all the taxi drivers in madrid go to eat. Great place to end the night as it opens at 5am. It's not the greatest place ever, but it's very authentic and quite cheap. 

El cisne azul, calle gravina 19, metro chueca. Mushrooms of all kinds, just delicious.

Nanai, calle barco 26. Great restaurant, the tapenade and the provolone are to die for.

Albur, calle malasaña 15. metro san bernardo or bilbao. Good restaurant. 

La bola, calle de la bola 5. great place to have cocido.

Asador aranduero, calle Alberto aguilera 26, great place to eat lamb or cochinillo (piglet) cooked in an old wood oven. 

La mucca, Plaza de Carlos Cambronero 4 metro noviciado. 

Maria bonita taco bar, calle san hermenegildo 15. Cheap mexican food in a tiny space, also great cocktails.

El planeta, calle perez galdos 10, tipical tapas place. 

Lhardy, calle san jeronimo 8. expensive, but it's a classic. Old, posh and decadent. Great caldo and crocquetas.

Casa labra, calle tetuan 12. Old place, 1860, famous for their cod. It's always packed.

Casa julio, calle madera 37, my opinion is that they gice the best croquetas of madrid, but mst people defend the ones they give at melo's in lavapies (too runny for my taste)

Places to drink: 

Let's begging with telling you to avoid el barco in calle barco, it has the worst poison ever disguised as alcohol. If you go there at least just order beer, your head will thank me.

1862, calle pez 27, metro noviciado. Old school cocktails, no piña colada or similars, here you'll have a great dry martini, sazerac, tom collins... 8euro each.

Martinez, calle barco 4, coktails and a nice brunch on sundays.

Lola loba, calle de la palma 38. nice place to get the first drink of the night, 5 euro each copa. 

El sideral, calle san joaquin 9. underground (literally) place with good music, opens till 3.

El fabuloso, calle estrella 3. Rockabilly, pink flamingos, leopard skin... nuff said.

Louie Louie, in front of lola loba, rockabilly place.

El 13, Calle barco 13, nice place with sofas, great to have the first drink, lucciano the owner is a really nice guy and the place is decorated with ""street art"",

J&amp;J Books and coffee, espiritu santo 47, second hand library and english bar, happy hour. They do a language exchange 3 nights a week. You go there to practice your spanish or help someone with their english.

Pepa tencha (was before the bandido doblemente armado, to this day I think the best name ever for a bar), calle apodaca 3 is a nice relaxed place to take a date, the back is full of mismatched sofas and the place has a really nice feel to it.

If you need any more advice I'd be willing to give it.

true,Pwndbyautocorrect,EURO,European Union,"&gt; I don't understand where your coming from, foreign aid is an option regardless of whether you share a currency or not.

There's a difference between foreign aid (e.g. U.S. aid to Pakistan) and wealth transfers inside a country (Western --&gt; Eastern Germany) or organisation (EU). 

&gt; Again though, paying for your exports with aid from other nations isn't exactly a sustainable policy - but it does work as long as they're willing to provide it. That applies whether you're sharing a currency or not.

Well, I would consider it sustainable in the European Union's case, seeing that the wealth transfers designed to balance out the difference between wealthier and poorer countries are provided on a stable basis by countries that share an interest in sticking with the EU (and the Euro). Because normally, poorer countries would have a weaker currency that would help them export more, if the Euro is to survive, wealth transfers are important because they bridge the gap and compensate for the lack of a weaker currency by allowing trade deficits to happen. 

&gt; If you're running a trade deficit, your nation is being drained of whatever currency its using. If that's Euros, you need to acquire a source of Euros from outside your nation to fund it, lest you'll end up with unemployment (shortage of spending). That's Greece/Spain/Portugal/etc. These countries are left borrowing Euros to fund their trade deficits

Concerning inter-EU wealth transfers Greece/Spain/Portugal, that money is not borrowed, it's redistributed and comes from EU contributions countries pay (those three countries being ""net receivers"" of those funds). You're right that in the end, they still have to borrow euros to fund those deficits though, as there aren't many wealth transfer mechanisms inside the Eurozone itself; most of them are done through the EU and aren't sufficient to close the gap.


&gt; Meanwhile compare Greece. If you have Euros to invest, there's all manner of places that you might sooner loan to than the Greek government. If you have yen to invest though, where can be safer than the Japanese government? USD, the US government? A quick look at bond yields will tell you that investors agree, there's no safer place that you can invest a government's currency than with the entity that issues it.

That is why troubled governments in the Eurozone can raise money on financial markets or borrow it from the EFSF (European Financial Stability Fund), which itself raises its funds on financial markets. Chances are, given the economic implications, the EFSF will always pay back investors, which makes it easier for it to raise money which it will then be able to lend to troubled economies, ensuring low interest rate borrowing compared to financial markets. That is mostly a bandaid solution though, as most countries will return to borrowing from financial markets when rates go down.

&gt; And that's the key difference. If Japan were to start running a trade deficit a'la the US, they can simply fill the gap in demand with even larger public sector deficits. If Greece runs a trade deficit, they may not be able to.

If the eurosummit's conclusion were that public sector deficits are allowed, I believe Greece would be able to borrow that money at reasonably low rates from the EFSF. Also, whether filling the gap with larger public sector deficits is sustainable is up to debate: it amounts to accumulating ever-increasing debts, and that's [what Japan has been doing for years](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/japan/government-debt-to-gdp). One day, this situation is bound to explode, but there's no noteworthy historical precedent of that either.

&gt; It's a problem inherent in fixed exchange and shared currency regimes that simply cannot be overcome without fiscal transfers between states. It's why the Euro is inherently flawed.

That's pretty much the core of your argument: the only way to overcome these flaws (and indeed those exist) is to balance them out with wealth transfers. That is where we are heading and it doesn't seem like a bad way to fix the problem. Think about it: common interests and goals amount to a united voice in foreign policy, which is what both the European Union and Eurozone countries lack at the moment. If Eurobonds are introduced (or any other Eurozone wealth transfers), countries won't have to face that problem anymore. It's a trade that wealthier countries like Germany would probably be okay with, although it's a compromise instead of a best case scenario. It's the only way of attaining common interests and, subsequently, more influence on a global stage.

If those measures are implemented, there would be no incentive to resort to mercantilist policies either. Countries' industries would develop, export higher-value goods (that is bound to happen with any well-managed economy) and ultimately the country would reduce its reliance on wealth transfers and one day become a ""net giver"" of wealth itself.

&gt; Running it simultaneously with free trade, as the EMU is, merely results in a quicker collapse. Those countries with the strongest export sectors (Germany) will merely end up succeeding whilst their partners collapse around them, for shortage of ""money"".

And that's the Euro's biggest flaw: running free trade policies while not helping countries finance their debt deficits. This, however, can be fixed, as said before, with measures such as Eurobonds, which I believe we are ultimately heading towards. Of course, some countries have an interest in delaying them (e.g. once again, Germany), but in the end they'll probably be introduced (or any other wealth transfer measure, for that matter). That or the Euro collapses in the long run, and that's bad for everyone.

&gt; but I'm hoping it's countries just going back to redefining money to something within their individual control. Having it foreign, out of everyone's control, does no one any favours.

What we need is equal say on Eurozone matters, so that a compromise is found. Again, not an economic best-case scenario for the wealthier party but if that is the goal, any type of association with a less wealthy economy should be shunned, resulting (obviously that's an extreme) in tiny fragmented economies that consider economic power before anything else. That's why it is important to consider political benefits along with economic benefits and find the right balance.

He would say that Polish and Ukrainian are twin-brothers; and Russia is like the big bully Step-brother.

But he is from an older time I think, born back when Galizien was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and grew up before Soviet Russification programs and propaganda were implemented.

I think Ukraine will be less Ukrainian if it chooses to align with Russia rather than the EU.

These recommendations to just take it out here ""without fees"" you'll probably get a really bad exchange rate.  When we moved I used currencyonline.com to transfer our money from Canada.  Basically what you do is ""buy"" euros online (this is a legally binding contract with them), transfer your USD into their US account and they transfer EUR into your account.  A requirement here is that you have both a US account to transfer out of, and a EUR account to transfer into.  After $5000 it is fee free, but it's only $4 if it's not $5000.  When we did it I put through a few hundred dollars and paid the fee, just to test that everything worked (and that it was a legitimate company), then I put through the rest of our money.

If, for example, you were to use currencyonline, $50k would be €37,410.  If you went with the [current Bank of America exchange rate](https://www4.bankofamerica.com/foreigncurrency/index.action?returnUrl=https://www4.bankofamerica.com/foreigncurrency/index.action&amp;state=IA), you would have €35,340 - almost $3000 less.

To start with, here's a resource for [3 days in Barcelona](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Guide-g187497-l51-Barcelona_Catalonia.html).

I went to a lot of places, and after 3 days I was *exhausted*. Fortunately I had a fantastic tour guide (who browses this sub, thanks again /u/love_the_octopus!) who showed me all these great places on a good schedule with minimal time wasted. I'm not a foody so I can't answer your questions on that end but I can tell you the places that I saw:

1. Sagrada Familia

2. Montjuic (and the castle up the hill and behind)

3. The Barcelona Olympic Stadium Complex

4. Las Arenas (It's just a mall, but it was once a bullfighting ring)

5. Picasso Museum (my most favorite thing!)

6. Museum of Catalan History

7. Gaudi's Casa Battlo

8. Gaudi's Casa Mila

9. Gaudi's Park Guell

10. Catalan Gotic

11. Las Ramblas

12. Catalunya Square (There are cheap bus rides to get you to the Airport here)

13. Arc de Triomf (There's also a park through this arch, and a zoo at the end of the park, if you come from the park TO the arch, there's a metro station a block ahead)

14. Rambla del Mar

Check out [this resource](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attractions-g187497-Activities-Barcelona_Catalonia.html#TtD) for things you should see. You'll find stuff I didn't see that you'll want to hit, and you'll see there are things I did hit that might not interest you. Have fun!

Generalmente a pancia in su con le mani salde sul bordo delle lenzuola per ventilare gas verso la mia dolce metà.

Mi rincorreva un gruppo di security dall'aspetto orientale dentro un castello/ambasciata francese. Io stavo cercando di mettere in salvo figlia e moglie da una finestra con scivolo verso un grazioso praticello quando un tipo emaciato irrompeva nella stanza. Il tempo di voltarsi per vedere a che punto erano nel saltare dalla finestra, tutte e due erano scomparse.

You will be definitevely able to survive. Not everyone speaks english, but you will always be able to get someone who can. Anyway, learn italian as soon as you can, it will greatly improve your social life.

And I can tell you, sometimes, being of a foreign origin is all it takes to provoke questions that may make some people uncomfortable. I can't say I face racism per se, though what I do hear a lot about is the stereotypes of Turkey and Turks that people have, and questions on whether they are true, or if I know about them, which can get tedious at times. No one has the time or energy to explain to person upon person, their cultural qualities and misunderstandings about them. You can't simply tell people to 'deal with it', as that is, in my opinion, a redundant argument coming from a person who has little understanding of the subject he is giving advice on. You say 'These people literally misrepresented the Turkish culture and people.', and it sounds like the same old ballads from proponents of Turkish cultural 'defects' in certain communities. If a very substantial number of people are behaving in a certain cultural framework, it's because it's part of the culture. The Turkish culture is not a homogeneous, integrated culture.  It is not comparable with many European cultures in terms of its uniformity (think of the 2013 protests in Turkey and their socio-cultural background). It has certain general characteristics, though the variation within it is very extensive. So please don't, as many Turks do, manipulate the Turkish culture towards your own preferences, to represent what you feel it should do. Don't pass judgement on who is representing the Turkish culture, other than in situations where, e.g., someone commits a crime on a cultural basis. If you want to ensure an adequate representation of Turkish culture, in line with your own background, represent it as an individual and please stop acting as though you have some role in ratifying the fabric of Turkish culture and identity.",0,1383987992,null,0,false,0,cda9wu5,t3_1q6mx7,t1_cda9wu5,t1_cd9wtph,null,1428730010,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

The idea of locking in certain supply (42bn cubic metres) at that time did not appear that wacky.
Tymoshenko could perhaps have obtained a lower price but she would have had to give Russia something in return. And that little something (pipeline control) would probably have diminished Ukraine’s sovereignty. The plus from the 2009 deal was that it set a proper system for ensuring timely payment of gas.

Di solito è un'attività che prevede del sesso (quindi chi domina può toccare e ordinare attività sessuali mentre il contrario non può ovviamente accadere), ma non è indispensabile, ci sono persone a cui piace essere legate e basta oppure dovere fare da camerieri, oppure gente a cui piace essere portata in giro col collare e trattata come un cane (a me per esempio piace).

Il punto chiave è che è tutto consensuale e fatto in sicurezza, altrimenti è un abuso.

Um die Verantwortung für die Übel, die zur Überschuldung führten, da abzuliefern, wo sie hingehört: schon mal von [Basel II](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_II) und Basel I gehört? 

Eingeführt als  EU-Richtlinien 2006/48/EG und 2006/49/EG. 

&gt;Fehlallokation des aufsichtsrechtlichen Kapitals (berücksichtigt in Säule 1 von Basel II). Da unter Basel I die Eigenkapitalunterlegung für Kredite an ein Kundensegment (z. B. Firmenkunden) unabhängig von der Bonität des Kreditnehmers erfolgte, bestand ein Anreiz, Kredite an Kunden mit mäßiger Bonität zu vergeben, weil bei diesen höhere Zinsen durchsetzbar waren und so ein größerer Gewinn auf das zu unterlegende Kapital erzielt werden konnte.

&gt;Einbeziehung weiterer Risiken (berücksichtigt in Säule 1 von Basel II). Unter Basel I mussten nur Marktpreisrisiken und Kreditrisiken mit Eigenkapital unterlegt werden. Die Erfahrung der letzten Jahre zeigt jedoch, dass eine Vielzahl von Bankenkrisen nicht durch diese Risiken, sondern durch operationelle Risiken ausgelöst wurden, so zum Beispiel die Pleite des britischen Bankhauses Barings durch fehlerhafte Kontrollen der Aktivitäten des Händlers Nick Leeson in Singapur. 

&gt;Inoffiziell ist auch bekannt, dass – neben der faktischen Relevanz operationeller Risiken – die Erwartung geringerer Eigenkapitalanforderungen für Kreditrisiken dazu führte, eine Unterlegung der operationellen Risiken anzutreiben.

&gt;Mangelnde Konformität bei aufsichtsrechtlicher Prüfung und Veröffentlichung von Risikoinformationen (berücksichtigt in Säule 2 und 3 von Basel II). Bisher bestanden keine internationalen Standards für die aufsichtsrechtliche Prüfung in verschiedenen Ländern. Ebenso bestanden keine einheitlichen Standards, die die unternehmenseigene Veröffentlichung von risikorelevanten Informationen regelten.

The French Revolution was important to facilitate political change and end feudalism all over Europe.

Napoleon almost managed to undo the revolution and was generally a bit of a bitch to their European neighbors. He once conquered Vienna and left a couple of days later, probably just for the bragging rights.

But they survived Napoleon and later even Charles de Gaulle, who was again ousted in a mini-revolution when France took 1968 a lot more serious than other countries.

The Netherlands are a huge trade partner for Russia and invest a lot in them. Dutch groups are  among the largest  investors in Russian agricultural projects. Putin has to make a stand and  show the world and more importantly the people of Russia that they are a powerful country so he uses harsh words against the Dutch government, but at the same time he can't be too harsh because Russia and the Netherlands need each other. 

It's not worth risking the decent relations with the Netherlands, especially because  the Netherlands are considered to be a so called 'multiplier country' in the EU. That basically means that the Dutch opinion on matters is usually considered to be important. If the Netherlands agree or disagree with something, it makes other countries much more likely to agree  or disagree. (Source: the leaked cables on wikileaks a couple of years ago had the American ambassador to the Netherlands explain this in detail to his superiors.)

Being too harsh might mean there are consequences  in the EU, which as a whole is by far  the biggest  trade partner of Russia with about 50% of total trade.

I can imagine why he'd be rather careful when discussing matters  with the Dutch king, especially after recent events. ",0,1383996971,null,0,1383997305,0,cdaayxr,t3_1q8hdq,t1_cdaayxr,t1_cda96yd,null,1428729516,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Poi ovvio, c'è anche una fetta di ignorantoni ma stanno più che altro tra loro.

Also, la maggior parte anche tra i vecchi, tende ad una forte nerditudine. Non è raro dal parlare di tortura, passare a parlare di monkey island o del Signore degli Anelli. Inoltre i discorsi di fisica, chimica e meccanica si sprecano, senza contare la moltitudine di informatici presenti, per cui in alcuni eventi, tra gente che si frusta e si lega, iniziano flame war tra linguaggi di programmazione o discussioni sui design pattern.

Nearest metro station is porta genova (on their map, on the far-ish right), then you have to walk or you can take a Tram. Number 2 should leave you pretty near. If you're going by car, expect some troubles parking in the zone.

As for museums: depending on what you want to see, Milano hosts a number of art galleries. Brera contains some ""classic"" works, while the PAC (Permanente di Arte Contemporanea, Permanent Exposition of Contemporary Art) hosts much modern works. The Palazzo Reale, just on the side of the Duomo, houses most of the big exhibitions. There should be one now dedicated to Jackson Pollock. [here](http://www.comune.milano.it/dseserver/webcity/portale/palreale.nsf/index.htm?readForm&amp;settore=MCOI-66DHPH_HP) are some info, only in italian :/
If you can, check out our Castle, one of the best defenses ever erected in europe - it was never taken by a military force, but w have suffered dearly by the hand of not-so-bright monarchs none the less. 

We have the Museum of Science and Technichs, dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci - you can see some fancy stuff in there, up to a decommisioned submarine. [here]http://www.museoscienza.org/visitare/) some italian only infos. The museum is hease to reach, just out of the S. Agostino metro stop (green line).

If you live in milan you've probably heard of Montenapoleone and Via della Spiga. In those streets and the small one that connect the two (I  think via Santo Stefano and Via del Gesù) are concentrated most of the big fashion firms. Some stores are leaking in the nearest sreets too (namely D&amp;G on corso venezia and Armani on Via Manzoni - Armani has its main offices and HQ between via manzoni and via borgosomething).

Versailles – Definitely arrive early. Take the train (at Montparnasse or St Lazare stations) or the RER C. When guide books say hordes of tourists will arrive, read thousands. Be  there by 9:30am in the courtyard to avoid fighting the crowds going through the Hall of Mirrors. Join the line for guided tours there, they're well worth the time and money. Visit the  Trianon Palaces and Marie-Antoinette's Estate.
It's a day well spent. 

Louvre – To avoid the huge line, arrive early and get the museum pass. You can easily spend 6 hours at the Louvre and still not see every room there is to see. To avoid museum sensory overload, try to break your visit in smaller bits and take advantage of the museum's night opening until 9:45 p.m. on Wednesdays and Fridays.

Musee d’Orsay – This is a great museum, especially if you love impressionist art. It's worth spending 3 hours here.
If you're into contemporary art, you can't miss a visit of Centre Georges Pompidou's art collections and the very modern architecture of Beaubourg.

Notre Dame: You can't escape the cathedral, the crypts and the bell tower. There's an hour wait to up into the towers, but it's well worth the time and the climb on a sunny day. They only allow 50 people at a time, so that’s why the wait is so long. Great views of the city. You can use the museum pass for both crypts and the bell tower.

Champs Elysées : it may be one of the world's most famous streets and one of the most expensive strips of real estate in the world, but it has lost a lot of its charm and feels very plasticky. If you want to see the Arc de Triomphe, take the metro directly to ""Charles de Gaulle - Etoile"" metro station. THEN have a walk along the very select Avenue Foch down to the [beautiful metro station ""Dauphine""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porte_Dauphine_%28Paris_M%C3%A9tro%29) by Hervé Guimard. If you want to enjoy a very good french restaurant that's still affordable, there's Guy Savoy's ""Bistro de l'Etoile"" nearby.

Prefer the view from the Trocadero Gardens to climbing up the Eiffel Tower, it's not worth the wait when you have so many things to see. Next to it you have the Palais de Chaillot with its renovated ""Cité de l'architecture et du patrimoine"" and the lesser known Musée Guimet with its wondrous Asian art collections.

The [Hotel des Invalides](http://www.france.fr/en/art-and-culture/hotel-des-invalides), located near the Governmental quarter (Palace of Matignon, many Ministerial buildings) has beside a Grand architectural presence, an Army Museum  worth seeing and the final resting place of Napoleon. Close to it there's the Rodin Museum : it has a great garden, you don't wait much to enter and it's not as densely packed as the Louvre. Then have some tea in the garden of [La Pagode cinema](https://www.google.fr/search?q=cinema+la+pagode&amp;num=30&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=pFo&amp;rls=org.mozilla:fr:official&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vSV-Up7GBMaH0AWrhYGABw&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1070&amp;bih=836), just behind the museum. This wild japanese-like building was built in 1896 as a lover's gift and inspired by the Nikko Tôshôgu sanctuary. Luis Buñuel's, Jean Renoir's, Jean Cocteau's early movies were first shown there as were later François Truffaut's and Éric Rohmer's New Wave movies. Push a bit farther and you're at Sèvres-Babylone, near [le Bon Marché](https://www.google.fr/search?newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Afr%3Aofficial&amp;biw=1070&amp;bih=836&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=le+bon+march%C3%A9&amp;oq=le+bon+march%C3%A9&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.82869.85911.0.86111.13.10.0.3.3.0.138.835.9j1.10.0....0...1c.1.31.img..0.13.864.OFnnC_rGo7I), the finest department store Paris has to offer.

Don't miss the visit of the Opera Garnier if you plan a shopping spree at the Galeries Lafayette close by. I'd also recommend visiting Passage Jouffroy and the Galerie Vivienne near [les Grands Boulevards](http://goparis.about.com/od/parisneighborhoods/p/grandsboulevard.htm). Definitely grab a bite at Bouillon Chartier (not for the food but for its unforgettable french brasserie atmosphere).

Sacré Coeur Basilica and Place du Tertre (Metro Anvers) : see them by night ! Enjoy the romantic view but don't stop there for a drink or a bite : stroll down to Place de la contrescarpe and the neighboring streets to find the cafés and restaurants Parisians go to. 

Parisian Markets :
The [Rue Montorgueil Neighborhood](http://www.montorgueilcorner.com/en/quarter/), close to the historic market hub that was Les halles until 1970 has unfortunately been terribly gentrified and feels less authentic. Prefer the [Rue Mouffetard market](http://tourbytransit.com/paris/attractions/rue-mouffetard.php). You can group [the visit](http://www.paris-hotels-charm.com/blog/walking-in-paris/511-walking-in-the-rue-mouffetard) with the Luxembourg gardens, the Pantheon and the Arenes de Lutece that are close by.

To enjoy a visit of the [Canal Saint-Martin neighborhood](http://goparis.about.com/od/sightsattractions/p/CanalStMartin.htm), consider taking a cruise of the Canal Saint-Martin and Paris' underground waterways. You can board the boat from Bastille. It's way better than the ""Bateaux mouches"" cruise that tourists usually take.

And last there's Le Père-Lachaise/Belleville/Gambetta less touristy area, my neighborhood which Courtney Traub described accurately [here](http://goparis.about.com/od/parisneighborhoods/a/Gambetta-Menilmontant-neighborhood-paris.htm).

Last advice, take advantage of Google's Streetview and Flicker's search engine. There's a ton of pictures there that can help you decide beforehand the places you're most attracted to.  Consider how lucky you are to be able to plan a trip in the digital age :)

true,Herra_X,null,null,"&gt;Roads are pretty cheap and only like 0.0000001% of the budget and they could be paid for by automated tolls or MOT.

I gave roads as an example for what governments do. Also welfare services, bureaucracy, justice system etc.

&gt;If I don't have a car why am I paying for the roads to pollute my air?

I don't know if you have ever noticed, but stores must fill their shelves somehow. This usually involves things called ""lorries"". Also, postmen must travel, so do ambulances, fire department, police, busses etc. They all depend on roads that are in good condition. 

Now, I'm not against limitations for private use of cars, but even if they were to vanish tomorrow, we still need roads. People and goods must travel and rail and air aren't the solution in every situation.

&gt;Companies pass the tax on to the people anyway. Why not just do it directly so people are aware of it?

No, only big companies pass the taxes to people. The small ones that only operate in one country or even in one city or only one town don't have the opportunity to do so. What we have here is a regressive tax that favours the companies that do least for the community and does so in massive scale. 


&gt;People always pay the tax. That is the entire point of tax.

Actually, taxes have several purposes. Pollution taxes, for example, are mainly there to halt or limit unwelcome activity and only secondly there to collect money. The same goes for cigarette taxes. We also have progressive taxes to both limit class divides and to make taxes bearable for the less well-off (after all, 10% for total income of 100 euros is a lot more than 10% out of 10 000 euros - even if the latter is a bigger sum).

And then we have taxes that are there just to... well.. tax. The taxes that are the same for everybody.
 
And as I said, lower classes and middle classes always pay taxes; the higher classes see this as more of a choice. 

What more, taxes create the society. Companies work in that society; big companies exploit that society (as they don't contribute). Should there not be a tax for companies to make them return some that they take?

After all, if having McDonalds or Starbucks is only a drain on your economy (they take a certain niche in society, contribute only low-paying work, don't pay taxes but do cause expenses in using the services of the society) why have them in the first place? Why not help a local or regional hamburger company or a coffee company to take the position that McDonalds or Starbucks has? The product is pretty much the same (perhaps even better, as it suits the tastes of the community better and there is more room for experimentation) AND they pay taxes (as well as bring middle-class jobs, as the officers also live in the area).

Global companies are a thing because we expect them to contribute as much to society as local ones. If this is not the case, then the reason for allowing global companies to operate at all is a false premise.

&gt;What other things should I expect and what tips do you have for me? Thank you!

I can give tips to general life in Italy, not about Turin explicitly, having never been there.

- We don't share the American obsession for everything god; religion exists here, obviously, but few take it seriously, and if you go about it the traditional American way you'll be branded a weirdo soon enough. Good news is, if you're an atheist nobody will bat an eyelid or care much - the very concept of /r/atheismcomingout generates disbelief and fits of laughter when I explain what it's about to Italians.

- If you've never been to Europe, driving is quite a different experience than what you're used to. And us Italians are insane even for European standards, as Jeremy Clarkson never fails to point out. Now, at some point you'll probably want to get a scooter, riding which follows its own set of unwritten rules - one of which is that filtering is not only allowed but required and encouraged, unless you want to be stuck in traffic all day.

- The food is absolutely fantastic. Prepare your palate for massive foodgasm. 

- If you want a coffee like the mildly caffeinated water you're probably used to, you'll have to explicitly order an American coffee (not all places will give it to you). Italian coffee is espresso by default - small amount, highly concentrated.

- Going to Italy with a spouse is like going to Oktoberfest with a keg. Fairly warned be thee.

- Most inter-country travel happens by train. Our train service is widespread, but its quality is abysmal - breakdowns are common, we're surprised when a train *doesn't* delay and planning connections is an adventure in itself. Always plan your train rides so you're at your destination several hours before any very important event, so if everything goes tits up you can replan your trip on the go and still be there reasonably on time. WIth any luck.

- ""Peperoni"" are bell peppers, not salami. Ask for pepperoni pizza and you will get no meat on it.

- Do not ever get into political arguments if you value your time. Specifically, try not to mention Berlusconi - the name tends to ignite intense feelings best left unexpressed.

Israelis interpret the obvious double-standard as the remnants of millennia of European antisemitism. It is hard to reconcile the disproportionate amount of criticism that Israel gets (Palestinian *trees* get the same screentime that Nigerian mass murders or Turkish settlements in Cyprus get) and any objective comparison of the urgency or scale of human rights abuses in Israel and elsewhere.

Edit: Also, the Israelis really do make every effort to limit how much their security arrangements affect the Palestinian population. That's what makes the criticism all the more ridiculous. The Sri Lankan government gathered civilians into ""safe zones"" and then bombarded the safe zones; the Israeli government fought a war in one of the most densely-populated places in the Middle East and the majority of the casualties were combatants, even though combatants were hidden among civilians and not uniformed. The Egyptian army uses live fire to put down protests; the Israelis are always trying to come up with new, non-lethal methods of dispersing protests (which are themselves often violent). Europeans do not seem to recognize these efforts, or simply dismiss them because there are still security precautions that inconvenience Palestinians.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"I can selectively quote from articles too, from your first source here's the outline of why an increase was expected: 

&gt;Under new CAP arrangements starting in 2015, Scottish farmers are likely to receive support levels per hectare in 2015 that are well below those in the rest of the UK and much of Europe. However, Europe has mapped out a convergence timetable that asks member states to bring all payments closer to an EU average figure of €196 per ha by 2019. In Scotland, that figure is currently closer to €100 per ha. 

And the beginning of the quote regarding 'the slight uplift' actually goes like this:

&gt;NFU Scotland president Nigel Miller said: ""It is a bitter blow that we have not secured an immediate uplift in our budget allocation. While we have been unable to secure a key element from this deal, there is enough within it and the commitments made that could deliver real, long-term benefits to Scottish farming if Scottish Government and Westminster can agree. 


From your second link:

&gt;The settlement, which was signed off at the highest level of Government against the backdrop of next year’s referendum on Scottish independence, represents a major victory for the farming unions representing England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which campaigned hard against the move to bolster Scottish farm incomes from their farmers’ pockets.


So, to outline what can be taken away from the three sources on ths page , the EU is reducing the CAP as a whole but has made special funds available to particular member states to help them reduce the differences in per hectare funding. The UK was able to take advantage of that provision on the grounds that Scotland currently has a per hectare subsidy just slightly over 50% of the EU average. Rather than readjust the CAP spending ratios in the UK to bring Scottish farming payouts towards the UK and EU Average, the UK Government elected to keep the ratios the same. That was in defiance of the EU policy they got the payout from and in defiance of the cross-party consensus (not SNP Policy) in the Scottish Parliament. 

In regards to your comment about the SNP policy being the worst part, there are two issues that I must take with it. Firstly, the SNP represents a different group of people than the UK government. When the two group's interests don't align the SNP must take the stance which is beneficial for their group. Secondly, the SNP wants to see equitable subsidies. It may want to see an increase overall but that's besides the point and not what they're arguing for here. 

With regards to the UK position on reducing the CAP, that's also a separate issue and it is most certainly not as simple as 'Taxpayers money for 2% of workforce bad' as you seem to suggest. 


And finally, please try and not descend to pettiness in your replies. 'Shit stirring' 'hissy fit', it's lobbying pure and simple, not a baby spitting the dummy out. 

To boil the question that this post has kind of being circling around down, if Scottish farmers are paid a significantly lower subsidy than rUK farmers, and funding was specifically made available to decrease that gap, why shouldn't the Scottish Government - acting on a cross-party position - complain when the funds are instead redirected to other parts of the UK. It's not shit stirring but highlighting the point that Scottish farmers are not being well served at the moment.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; I fail to grasp the logic of your defense. Other nations do heinous deeds, so we should be able to do them too?

That wasn't my defense. My defense was that the objective negative effect of Israel's behavior does not correspond to the criticism Israel gets from Europe, given the European baseline of criticism for similar or worse behavior from other nations.

&gt; Disproportionality is arguable, especially so when it comes to consistency and persistency of abuse.

Is it? Turkey has been occupying Kurdish-claimed territory since before its inception as the Republic of Turkey, its war against the Kurds has displaced more people than the Israeli-Arab conflict and certainly killed a lot more. The Moroccan-Western Sahara crisis is 40 years old; how much ""better"" is that than the 60-year old Israeli-Arab conflict? There are almost as many Tamils in Sri Lanka as Palestinians in the former Mandate of Palestine. Could you please explain to me how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict *objectively* deserves more criticism than similar or worse conflicts raging elsewhere?

&gt; Dahiya doctrine

The Dahiya doctrine isn't any worse than the policies of other countries fighting insurgent groups, certainly far less destructive than the former practices of Europeans, and it was ended anyway because it was both ineffective and unpopular.

In latino caput vuol dire banalmente testa, mai sentito il modo di dire ""pro-capite""? ovvero a testa. :) 

Il colle Campidoglio in Roma, chiamato mons Capitolinus, portava questo nome perché era il più alto e sacro, infatti sulla sua cima c'era il tempio principale della città, quello della triade di divinità più sacre della Roma antica, ovvero Giove, Giunone e Minerva, chiamate per l'appunto Triade Capitolina. La versione più antica di questo tempio risale addirittura ai tempi di Romolo e della fondazione della città nel 753 AC.

Sempre li sul Campidoglio i Romani custodivano le tavole della Lex Romana, la legge, di cui andavano incredibilmente fieri. 

In seguito nel medioevo sul Campidoglio viene costruito il palazzo dei governatori della città. Il colle diventa così sede del governo cittadino. A questo periodo risale la parola moderna Campidoglio usata per indicare un palazzo del governo, esportata poi anche in inglese come Capitol. 

Anche la parola Capitale deriva sempre dal colle Campidoglio e quindi dal latino caput.

OTOH Wales is the most republican region of Britain (I'll ignore NI, their republicanism is weird).

I've always said that the difference between Welsh and Scottish separatism is the relationship with the monarchy. The SNP took republicanism off the agenda because a lot of separatists are also monarchists. In Wales an independence movement would probably get stronger by pushing republicanism. Which is why PC like to call the Queen ""Mrs Windsor"" in the Welsh Assembly (with the AM inevitably getting kicked out of the days session).

It's not a question of being ""relatively well paid"". It's a question of being paid enough in order to not beggar their neighbours by importing demand. To give a bit of an extreme example to illustrate this point: Imagine that Earth makes contact with intelligent aliens living on the moon, whose technology is vastly superior to that of Earth's. Now, these aliens pay their workers relatively well but nevertheless because of their competitive advantage they can produce much more than they need. So, they export most of the stuff to Earth countries with which they share a currency. You see the problem right away, don't you? They'll be siphoning all the demand from Earth but they would ask fo almost nothing in return, thus making everyone else indebted to them.

Yup.

I fully agree with what this dude is saying. Yes, we're in a recession. Yes, we're doing okay-ish considering the international events. Yes, we could do better. Yes, markets actually hate that we care for our citizens.

In the end, though, we're going to do what we've always done: elect incompetent officials, who will bend over backward and happily take it up the ass from the EU and then blame it all on the EU instead of blaming it on their inability to stand up for themselves and what they believe in.

Sonneborn hat in der Tat einen Strick gedreht, aber der Hals in der Schlinge ist sein eigener: Zum einen unterschlägt dieses Video, dass im modernen, bis auf die Knochen heruntergesparten Journalismus es durchaus gängige Praxis ist, Interviews gleich ganz vorzufertigen bzw. redigieren und autorisieren zu lassen (letzteres ist nicht minder verwerflich); ebenso ist die Quelle für vieles, was publiziert wird, das Fax der Redaktion, an das PR-Agenturen vorgefertigte Artikel schicken (die [neunte Folge von Alternativlos](http://alternativlos.org/9/) hat das thematisiert).  Die Deutsche Bank dürfte, was diese Praxis angeht, keine Ausnahme sein, und es ist böswillig, anderes zu implizieren.  Von daher ist es keine Überraschung, dass sie einen in ökonomischen Dingen unkundigen, dafür telegenen PR-Experten, der zudem nicht weiß, welches Wissen er beim Zielpublikum voraussetzen kann (s.u.), vorschicken und Textbausteine aufsagen lassen.  Hier nicht das eigentliche Problem zu benennen, zeugt entweder von Perfidie oder von Dummheit.

Zum anderen wird gar nicht darauf eingegangen, *was genau* an der kommunizierten Sichtweise der Deutschen Bank eigentlich falsch sein soll – man zitiert ja nicht einmal in einer Weise aus dem Schriftstück, die eine Auseinandersetzung erlaubte.  Es wird lediglich das Vorurteil verstärkt, dass die Elite dem Pöbel sowieso nur etwas vorlüge, auf dass er stillhalte.  Da heute datumsbedingt das Thema Antisemitismus etwas höher im Kurs steht, sei hier darauf verwiesen, dass solche Argumentationsweisen unter manche Definitionen von Antisemitismus fallen, nämlich solche, deren Fundamente der vermeintliche Gegensatz von schaffendem und raffendem Kapital und die angebliche Weltherrschaft der Banken sind.  Das fällt beim deutschen Publikum, [dessen Kenntnisstand in Wirtschaftsfragen nur als mangelhaft bezeichnet werden kann](http://www.welt.de/finanzen/verbraucher/article13753254/Wirtschaftskrise-ueberfordert-die-Deutschen.html), und das von jeher ein starkes antikapitalistisches Ressentiment aufweist, auf fruchtbaren Boden.  Bei den Öffentlich-Rechtlichen spürt man selbstverständlich, dass das ankommt, und bedient es deswegen kritiklos, statt es zu bekämpfen.  Antworten auf die Fragen nach Macht, der Finanzkrise, Hedgefonds, den Millionengehältern der Banker, der Funktion der Banken im Wirtschaftssystem und der Globalität des Handels bleibt die Sendung schuldig, weil es ihr gar nicht darum ging (sonst hätte man einen Professor für Volkswirtschaft gefragt), weswegen ihr Aufklärungswert negativ ist.  Aber der Zweck einer solchen Sendung liegt ja auch nicht darin, aufzuklären, sondern Gelächter zu erzeugen und die Hämesucht der Bevölkerung im Rahmen des Zulässigen zu befriedigen.

Exactly the same situation in the US. It seems like people are very entitled, especially older people. Social Security (government pension) was a response to the great depression so the argument they 'paid into it their whole life' is true. But things like Medicare (government health insurance for seniors) were not implemented until 1966 and some expanded programs until much later, even into the 2000s. Yet entitled older people always seem to think they 'paid' for things. 

I am not proposing we let sick old people die in the street. But the oldest generation is also the most wealthy. They seem to be the most entitled as well.

Many things have already been co-opted from one religious organization to another. Both Christmas and Easter are part of that. Even Halloween, which is becoming more popular in Germany, started out as a takeover of a pagan celebration into a more Christian one.

Plus, the prizes for winning were interesting. Later on the quality began to decline, it became a single path (or at least it seemed like, the next 4-5 times I went I was always sent through the same one), the prizes became worse and according to my mother it became more expensive.

true,Patedam,ZBTQuebec,Quebec,"&gt; Si après rationalisation, chaque euro est dépensé de façon optimale comme tu le souhaites, pourquoi veux-tu réduire ensuite les recettes fiscales ?

EDIT : Je réponds à ça plus en détail, si pour un euro on a aujour'hui une demi prestation et qu'après rationalisation tu en as 2 mais que tu n'en a besoin que d'une, tu peux donc dépenser plus que 0,5 euro. L'état t'en prendra peut être 0,6 pour compenser ceux qui ne peuvent pas payer. Dans le principe, rationnaliser c'est diminuer les dépenses tout en augmentant la productivité, c'est pas diminuer les dépenses de façon aveugle en balançant la règle d'un fonctionnaire sur deux pas remplacé (ce qu'on associe aux libéraux bien que ça soit un peu trop simple, je suis libéral et je trouve ça con comme méthode)

&gt; C'est le discours qu'utilisent les libéraux depuis 20 ans pour détricoter l'Etat-Providence. 

L'état n'a jamais été détricoté, l'état représente 56% du PIB aujourd'hui. (Les libéraux c'est qui au fait ?)

Le but de rationaliser les dépenses c'est dans un premier temps de ne plus avoir de déficit, et même d'avoir un excedent. Monter les prélèvements à tout bout de champ sans avoir en face un effort de l'état et des prestations sociales de plus en plus mauvaise, ça ne tiendra pas socialement longtemps.
Une fois en excedent, le poids de la dette diminue directement et donc les prélèvements vont pouvoir diminuer en proportion.
Par ailleurs, ya énormément d'économies à faire en dehors de l'état providence, et de l'argent à réinjecter dans la justice par exemple. (genre mille feuille territorial, 36000 communes qui mutualisent pas les dépenses, niches fiscales à gogo et illisibles)

Dans tous les cas, je suis pas contre imposer les gens, mais par contre imposer l'investissement c'est contreproductif, c'est pour ça que par exemple les pays nordique imposent les revenus et pas (trop) le capital.",0,1384031959,null,0,1384032337,0,cdakamf,t3_1q8yxj,t1_cdakamf,t1_cdajwmb,null,1428725096,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

Regarding the latter, the article does quite rightly point out that no one in power is in any position to criticise any other party's history on the subject, since they've all done it. As for my own personal observation, I do find that **many** politicans in Britain are dyed in the wool I-wish-I-were-American-please-make-me-American at heart, not unlike a large section of the more conservative parts of the country, who seem to think England lies somewhere in the mid-Atlantic near Bermuda. Viewed this way, the politicans are a lost cause and simply following their Washington orders, which they are all too happy to oblige.

The populace, on the other hand, is more split. The more conservative members of the public see all of this as a triumph that Britain is a steadfast partner with America in the war on terror, keeping Britain safe, and swallowing all the party lines thrown about by basically any newspaper that isn't *The Guardian* or *The Independent*. On the other hand, your more left-of-centre members of the public (quite rightly, IMO) see this as a massive breach of civil liberties and take a much more adversarial view on the subject. As to the question of whether or not that part of the population (which I believe outnumbers the GCHQ can do no wrong crowd) will actually start acting European and stop accepting the surveillance... probably not. It's not in Britain's nature. People in Britain just swallow it and walk around with it seething in their minds until they're occupied enough to forget about what it was they were angry about. 

I can't remember where, but I was reading an opinion piece just recently where one political analyst said that this whole surveillance/Snowden story is the first time he's ever seen supporters of the Labour party in the UK, the Liberal party in Canada, and the Republicans in the US agree on the same issue, lumping the Democrats in with the Tories.",0,1384032699,null,0,false,0,cdakjq0,t3_1q90a5,t1_cdakjq0,t3_1q90a5,null,1428724978,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

I think a lot of people in Sweden are very frustrated with the completely unsustainable amount of immigration to the country. One frustrating thing probably is that all but one of the political parties support immigration or want to increase it. 

Sweden already grants asylum to more people per capita than any other nation in the EU except Cyprus and Malta. You may think that makes no sense, because you're supposed to seek asylum in the first country you set foot on and Sweden is all the way up there, far away from any conflict in the world, but that's the way it is.

Dopo averci provato un po' con la ragazza, lei scende, e mi trovo a circa 20 minuti dall'arrivo solo con questi due ragazzi, anche se il vagone non era proprio vuoto. Chiacchieriamo un po', mi chiedono a che fermata devo scendere e altre cose e viceversa. Dopo un po' uno dei due ragazzi sembra arrabbiarsi da solo... Mi sembra in stato confusionale, prende a darsi manate in faccia (e sul cappello) o sul sediolino vuoto. Dopo un po' mi guarda e fa ""mi devi dare quel telefonino che tieni, altrimenti ti accoltello."" Io dico ""no dai, ma che stai dicendo? Ma che fai? No."" Mi alzo fregandomene di tutto e me ne vado. Procedo a scendere a una fermata diversa da quella che gli avevo detto e faccio una cazzo di corsa verso casa, giusto per assicurarmi che non mi abbiano seguito... Fine della storia.

Sorrento è una bella città che ha circa 2400 anni di storia... Fu fondata dagli etruschi, poi colonizzata dai greci, poi dai romani (sorrentum). Si vedono ancora le mura dell'XVI secolo (ci passavo sotto tutte le mattine per andare a scuola).

It's fucked up how the system works, it drives the immigrants to develop recent to the original population, and the original population that live near the problem areas develops resentment against the immigrants.

true,Herra_X,null,null,"&gt;I never said that. You're taking my own words out of context somehow

Well, you did say that French have a large Nazi presence and that muslim immigrants hold disdain for Jews. Immediately after you mention that kippahs are banned in public (=government-sanctioned oppression of Jews). How should this be interpreted if not that government is pandering to jew-haters and ""Nazi presence""?

I also heavily dislike people who knowingly sprout half-facts (which are half-lies that you may even make presentable with sources that pass quick inspection!). I find it extremely poor conversation that one should always called out of.

&gt;http://www.jta.org/2013/03/08/news-opinion/world/nazi-symbols-used-against-jews-in-two-incidents-in-paris

Let's see. We have painted swastikas on a door, somebody doing a nazi-salute and perhaps a third guy who did a salute and then literally threw a bible toward police officers. He was then arrested. 

So what we have here is vandalism (one should always scorn people who resort on this) and two guys waving their hands; each working alone. The first one is extremely unfortunate and the other two just unfortunate; I wouldn't say this is a proof of ""large (relative) Nazi presence"". Where are the parades with Wagner-playing on boombox? Where is the political agenda, where are the Nazi-candinates to the local council elections? 
 
&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/french-neo-nazis-appeal-earns-him-extra-year-in-jail/

Well, here we have a gang of three who resorted in vandalism, got some jail and then one year of extra for complaining. They weren't obviously just indulging on a passing fancy, what with tattoos and pendants. 

Pretty happy end all around. 

But again, is this Nazism as a large presence? What would be low-presence, if painting gravestones and doing Sieg Heil by lone nut is enough to get your anti-semitism meter on the red?

&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24556167

Ah, good old Vikernes. Satan-worshipper, murderer, self-confessed hater of Anglo-Americans and Jews, burned few churches etc. etc. Well-known black metal musician. Spent 15 years in jail at Norway and decided to get a new beginning in France. You know, I'd accept calling him a Nazi and anti-semitist but somehow that sounds a bit like calling Stalin/Hitler/Idi Amin as an unrepentant jaywalker. 

Plus he has served his time and apparently RETIRED to France and the newspiece you linked to talks about charges against him being found unbased. 

...

So yes, I shall accept that there are are some idiots running with spray cans vandalising property. And that Vikernes lives in France (but surely you can't say that one guy who isn't part of any known organisation as being enough to condemn the whole country?). But this.. Where are the riots? Where are the parades? Where is the list for candinates in the next elections? This is apart as low-key as you can get.

Picasso Museum : buy audioguide here too, they have LCD screen that will show you more details and paintings. Take your time in first room (it's amazing what Picasso could do at age 14) and last rooms (looking at dates on paintings' label, understanding he could paint a new painting every day)

Casa Mila (La pedrera) : get there at the end of the day, when you can enjoy sunset on the roof : great time for photos

Parc Guell : go as high as you can for the view on the city and the sea and escaping crowd.

There is only one answer and that is limiting immigration. I mean what you guys are doing is beyond ridiculous. You:

1. Accept too many migrants. You have a way too small of a country to accept that many people.

2. Let's be honest; your immigrants are all unskilled and cannot possibly contribute to your country. At the end of the day, you're running a country not a charity.

3. You also require no effort from them at all to integrate and you give them enough social assistance that they never need to work a day in their lives. 

At the end the result is you have creating an immigrant class that grew too quickly, that is unskilled and uninterested in ever assimilating and continues often backward traditions which go completely against your country's values. You have eroded all respect for your country and its history and values, you are overburdening your working class with heavy heavy taxes to support your ridiculous immigration policies and your top talent will soon leave due to security issues and heavy taxes.
