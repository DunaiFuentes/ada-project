Commission should just have a chairman/ head of/ director, which ever translates best, the commission isn't meant to be grand it's the bureaucratic unelected arm it seems wrong for it to have more prestige.

President of the European Parliament is basicly the speaker of the house to go with speaker, it is much more sensible for these things to do what they say on the tin.

President of the ECB should be governor/ manager/ chief secretary of the bank.

Presidency of the Council of the European Union is a silly name for that job just call them the chairman of the council.

true,darelight,,Muhackl,"* School life is different, as many already said: get to school by bike or public transport, walk freely around the school, school year 11+ (16ys+) are often allowed to leave schoolyard/school during breaks to eat something etc., finishing school in class 10 or 12 is often celebrated by drinking shitloads of beer in school (after the last final exam) and making fun of the teachers (they will tolerate) called Abistreich
* Start 'Lehre' or 'Ausbildung' (apprenticeship) at the earliest age of 15 (Hauptschule, jobs like mechanic, craftsman, office clerk), 16 (Realschule, same jobs or 'better' ones)
* Side job allowed at the age of 13 (13/14 = mow lawn for neighbor, do paper rounds, max. 2 hs/day only weekday after school. 15-18 = max 8 hs/day, only weekday in times from 06:00-20:00, 18+ = everything as legal)
* **General much more personal freedom**
* drinking beer is normal with 14/15, legal at 16
* Younger than 14: out til 20:00, 14- 16: stay out until 22:00, 16 - legal age(18): until 00:00
* Teenagers may move around more freely, like visiting other cities by train. There are no really obligations that tell parents when or how they have to watch their kids, so it's decision of the parents what the kids are allowed to do and what not - except the age limits. 14 is a common age where children really 'start' enjoying independent life, in small steps... because of own responsiblity (see next point)
* Teenagers with 14 and older are 'of the age of criminal responsiblity' (leo.org translation...), means that they can be punished for their actions, but are allowed to do more, also in legal terms (called 'limited capacity of contract')
* You can drive alone at 18, with 17 you can make a driver's license which allows to drive with one parent as front passenger
* **They are really really better sexually educated**, think of Bravo and stuff. Age ranges for first sexual contact (not only sex, more like oral etc.) start at 12,13,14 (yes, that's realistic for the earlies) to 16,17,18 (average age from a 2008 article is 16.2 ys)
* Social life is a really big point, I will drop some points that come to my mind. ""Sportvereine"" or ""Vereine"" (Sport-/Clubs) are common, football (I mean **FOOT**ball, okay? :D) is the most popular sport. There are big scout groups (e.g. DPSG), but they are almost always absolutely not religious. Very much stuff likes all this. Besides that, you can see the kids meeting just to hang out. In cities, you can see groups of kids hang out without parents in the malls or city centre starting at age 11/12 (school year 5/6+). Internet/FB/etc. is as common as everywhere.

Or rather, they are educated in different things.

It's a matter of capitalism really. Making films and television in for example Danish is a lot less profitable than making them in German or French, simply because the Danish-speaking audience is so much smaller. French and German meanwhile are proper world languages (French more so than German these days). You have potential audiences for your work that outnumber the total amount of Danish-speakers on the planet by a factor of hundreds if not thousands.

What this means is that media providers in Denmark have less sources of Danish-language media to distribute, meaning that it simply becomes impractical to dub all the stuff you have to import. There's too much of it and it's too expensive.

German and French-speaking media meanwhile have plenty of material to chose from. Obviously you still want to import stuff, especially the really popular stuff from other countries, but you can fill up the time between prime-time hits with native content that you don't need to translate, meaning you can focus your entire translation budget on doing big dubbing projects for popular films and series instead of spreading it out to cover a bunch of syndicated filler as well.

There's simply not as much need for a German or a French person to learn to live with subtitles and foreign language media, and so they don't.

I am mostly upset that Europeans have this ""holier than thou"" approach whenever this topic comes up. They have this weird notion of Europe-where-everyone-and-their-grandma-wants-to-be-here. Even the Americans notorious of this has changed and became more self-critical, but Europeans continue to believe they got heaven on earth.

Sure Turkey wanted to join for some time. But that is an argument for the ""common man"" of Europe who doesn't know any better.

Actually, the entry to EU is used and abused as a tool by various Turkish governments. Want to pass an unpopular law? Well, ""EU wants it"". Want to prove you're progressive despite your religious roots? Quick, book some meetings at Brussels and reiterate that ""Turkey will never cease to bang on the European door"". Want to pass a legislation that is unpopular with other power sources? ""EU regulations requires it! It's not us!""

Europeans (not all of them but quite some who doesn't like to think too much) on the other hand took this kind of interest and turned it into a ""Turkey wants a piece of us so badly"" popularity contest. It's immature and comical.

Today Turks do not want to join. They've had enough. Mainly because yes, the cold cold shoulder and double standards they got from EU. Also because they don't buy the EU card their politicians pull. They also realized that EU is not their ""friend"" just because the whole damn country is founded to be a secular democracy (in a sea of lunatics and succeeded at that by a very large margin (more than some EU candidates on the secularism point) , and that doesn't mean Europeans will welcome them with open arms, helping to establish that goal. Oh no. I can say they've done quite a lot to prevent that from happening.
EU is a ""friendly trade partner"" at best.

And finally, because Turkey realized in the past decade it can get things done.

We're not only European. Emphasis on the only. We're also Middle-Eastern, Central Asian and Caucasian. We do not fit the narrow ""European and European only"" schema. And I'm quite glad for that, let's keep it that way.

Before, EU was the odd and unfitting clothes that got somehow popular. Now the society matured up and said ""oh god, what were we thinking?"".

The posts that I see here that goes like ""Good. Let's ban them! They would never be allowed to be part of EU anyway hheheheh"" posts to me are quite immature.

I actually now think I give a strong reaction because I've been taught to expect more from Europeans, yes even the common European posting on reddit should somehow be more wiser than saying things like ""Good! The hell with Turkey!ahahah"". Of course, that is far from the truth, the ratio of people with thick skulls is about the same where ever you go.

true,Bardaf,Zbelleile,Belle-Île,"1) Robespierre has two sides and is both respected and hated. He did a lot for the revolution but also decided the Terreur (killing anybody against the revolution, which is like going back to tyranny).

2) Lafayette is not as popular here as he is in the US, he wanted to keep the king even if he was for a parliament state. Still, he's often put in the ""bad guys"".

3) Marat is in the ""good guys"", but most people won't be able to tell anything more than the fact that he was killed in his bath.

4) Who the F is that ?

5) Louis XVI is the ultimate bad guy, depicted as a coward more interested in keys than in his people, fleeing from Paris... In the end he was just an overprotected child who didn't know squat about reality.

6) Danton is an ugly bloke but puns on his name are infinite. Weirdly, it's rare to mention him or Robespierre alone, they often go together, ""Danton et Robespierre"" as the two greatest figures of the Revolution.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"Let me quote you :

&gt;The posts that I see here that goes like ""Good. Let's ban them! They would never be allowed to be part of EU anyway hheheheh"" posts to me are quite immature.

And on a previous comment :

&gt; like a club full of people who keeps shouting around ""you can't be in here lalalal!@?!"".

Fact is, no one went around like this. You added the ""hahahas"" and all, but from what I read, and heard in my daily life, no one laughs at Turkey for ""wanting it so badly"" or anything. They simply know it's a debated issue, and either want Turkey in, or don't want it in, or have no opinion. You're the one thinking people are laughing at your country, but I never in my life, IRL or on the internet, noticed anything of the sort. Your interpretation of people very calmly and seriously commenting on this subject, an issue that really exists (Turkey asking to join the EU), tells me that the only problem here is your hurt feelings. You're the only irrational/comical commenter here. I do understand however that you feel insulted. I'd feel insulted as well in some sort of similar situation involving my country. So I know where you're coming from.

Those who oppose Turkey's entry in the EU, like me, aren't prancing around saying they're ""holier than thou"" and that's where everyone wants to be. That's how you interpret it, like a guy rejected by a girl, so he thus feels resentment and believes the girl thinks she's too good for him. It's not that she feels she's too good for him, it's because she doesn't see herself with him, they're not compatible, it doesn't mean the guy isn't attractive, or nice in his own right.

Now, if Turks feel more and more that they shouldn't be a part of the EU, that they're too different and can do without it, I'm fine with that because I agree. I'm glad things evolve to this line, because once again, it's not the EU that asked Turkey to join. The reasons why Turkey never got admitted is because, above all, there's a serious issue with Cyprus. There are other conflicting issues of course, but that's the main one. It's not really about secularism. In Western and Northern Europe alone, France is probably the only truly and constitutionally secular country (though in practice, they're all almost secular). I for my part, consider, like you to some extent, that Turkey simply isn't European and for this reason alone shouldn't have been considered in the first place, which would have saved everyone's time. Turkey has its own thing going on, and it's great, so I don't mean to insult of course. 

Otherwise it's not Europe's fault if Turkish politicians use the EU accession excuse to pass unpopular laws. I'm sorry that happens but you can only blame Turkish politicians.

Lastly, I'm personally not overjoyed by the EU. I don't think it's the best thing ever, I don't think nor want everyone to want to join.;etc. I think it's good to have some sort of union of European countries, however I do agree the EU has its faults and all, and if I were in charge I'd do things differently.",0,1361480149,null,0,false,0,c8jai1j,t3_18w9vz,t1_c8jai1j,t1_c8j9q9p,null,1431365194,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

    pronouns used as direcat and indirect objects (Ich glaube es nicht.)
    specific adverbs of time (Warum arbeitet sie heute nicht?)

    predicate adjectives(Er ist nicht nett.)
    adverbs (Ich arbeite nicht gern mit ihm zusammen.)
    general time adverbs (Ich sehe ihn nicht oft.)
    prepositional phrases (Ich fahre nicht zu ihm.)
    separable prefixes (Er kommt auch nicht vorbei.)
    infinitives (Ich kann ihn nicht verstehen.)

You are basically left alone with all your planning that is going on outside of school. When I was younger I was in school from 8am - 2pm and that was it except some PE classes took part in the evening. But nowadays it's different and ti also all depends on what Bundesland (state) you live iin so you cant really generalize it. AFter school you can decide what you do. If you wanna play sports at a local Sportverein (team) or just wanna hang out with friends or whatever the hell you wanna do after school. A lot of people work but not even close to as many as in teh US. When I lived in the US almos all my friends worked and they all had like actual jobs as waiters or at grocery stores or a gast station or whatever. In Germany a lot of teenagers tutor or babysit or hand out newspapers. 

I grew up in the second biggest city in Germany so I can't really agree with the person who said we dont need cars to get to our friends places. I always had the problem of living super far away from all my school friends because we came from different parts of the city and it wasn't always easy to hang out without having to ask my mom for a ride home or take the bus. I was a lot more independent in the US since a lot of my friends could drive and we would just drive wherever we wanted to go. It's also not really typical to always hang out at someone's house in Germany. A lot of people don't have houses, they ust share smaller apartments with their family and so there is never enough room to hang out with a large group of friends. So we were always forced to go out and hang some place else. 

I dont know what else to tell you. Teenagers basically do the same stuff here than they do over in the US. we hang out, play sports, go to the movies, watch tv, read, go to school.

I prefer subtitles. Fortunately, there’s almost always an option to choose them instead. When I’m watching something at home, I often load english subtitles.

Come on now. Here are a few links disproving you from straight from r/europe.

that should keep you busy for some time. this is from a 5min search, not a cherry picked personal list of mine mind you. that's just reddit. You're living under a rock if you're not aware of the rise of racist/far-right parties in Europe. Or perhaps you're supporting one and that is why.

I find the ""Euro-girl rejecting Turkey"" analogies a bit childish since I can point to a bajillion Europeans acting they way I said earlier, but I'll bite. I think it's more like, ""kids who does not let the awkward one who tries hard to play with them."" It's not about rejection of EU accession that hurts the relations. It's the attitude, the harshness, the barbaric nature of how Europeans convey their point of view. It's like they're trying to rub it in and add some salt. 

My point is that those times are over. It's not effective anymore. No one really wants to join EU, certainly not for economic reasons and culturally, let's just say we wouldn't want to be associated with a region responsible for two world wars, champions in genocide and countless atrocities around the world. Especially not this time. So quit with the yelling. I'm not obliged to say these things, sure I could let it pass. Who the hell cares what a few bigoted Europeans say on the internet? Turkey will prevail anyhow and Europe will act Europe. Thing is today I was at home and not at work, so I just had a look at /r/europe, full well expecting all this bigotry against Turkey. It's not even surprising anymore. I'm continuing to reply because you seem to be writing in more coherent sentences that most Europeans with an anti-Turkish state of mind.

I think a more constructive tone would be to say ""look, that's not going to work"" from day one. Also OK to state, you're HR record is not good, election system is ancient etc. etc. Sure, I'd accept that, be my guest. But not the redneck-ish ""Hey get back to where you came from you Islamic country you!!"". As I said, Turkey does not need the verification of Europe to be secular, a democracy, to treat its diverse ethnicities with dignity and human rights. 

And it's getting there. Oh yes. But it looks like the Europeans are not liking it one bit. It's ironic actually, the more Turkey becomes like ""the west"" the more Europeans become abrasive. It's like ""hey you're supposed to act like all the other eastern countries and feed our superiority complex, who are you to reject us? We reject you!""
It's like they think they have a monopoly on treating people right.
And if you do it, it's because they taught you and you get a pat on the back. Real delusional.

There are ""others"" in every country where the rest of the society expects them to stay low or act as punch bags. That can be ""blacks"", ""mexicans"", ""tibetans"" or so. For Europe, for the large part, that is Turks for reasons that I'm not going to go in here. Something to do with Ottomans doing a good job in taking up against all of Europe. I've heard it myself from the director of a certain very large press agency based in London that ""you guys are supposed to be the assholes of Europe"". This is a direct quote from him, about their biased reporting of an eventful football match between TR- SW, heard by me. I'm a live witness of how Turks who had a very European-centric education (far better than their counterparts in Europe, studying all sorts of European history, art, on top of acing their baccalaureats or abiturs) got blocked in the workplace, because, you know, a Turk can never be a CEO or so in a European company.

But of course, it's only a matter of time. There are already millions of Turks in the EU as citizens and that number will only rise. Give it another decade or so, Turkey's GDP per capita will be equal to that of Spain, Turks in EU will multiply in numbers and there's no escape. So we should just take in the punches a bit more. Which is why I fundamentally believe your kind of ideology will be inevitably extinct. And I personally believe USA is decades ahead of EU in treating people with diverse ethnicities.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"The examples you gave of moments when redditors were contemptuous of Turkey's accession to the EU were not in this thread (except the last one, which was a perfectly valid answer to your comment)... not to mention they received criticism from other redditors... Bad examples.

&gt; No one really wants to join EU, certainly not for economic reasons and culturally, let's just say we wouldn't want to be associated with a region responsible for two world wars, champions in genocide and countless atrocities around the world. 

Coming from a Turk, that's pretty humorous. I know your country has never admitted its crimes, or tried to amend for them, unlike most EU countries... maybe that's why you're so oblivious to the comical nature of that comment of yours.. 

Otherwise, while the EU is in economic crisis right now, it's still the number one economic region in the world, and developing countries within the EU, like Poland, benefit a lot from being in it. So there are economic reasons why most developing countries neighboring the EU (like Turkey) want to join.

Otherwise, the rest of your comment is mind boggling in its irony. You're mad at your perceived notion of Europeans feeling superior and mean to Turks, while you agree that Europe has opened its arms to millions of Turkish immigrants (mostly Germany to be honest, I've hardly seen a Turk in my life, and I live in Paris), and rejoicing about how soon, very soon, Turks will be numerous enough and strong enough to impose themselves..etc. You're much more bellicose and nationalistic than anyone here. It kind of reminds me of a story I read about some Turkish best selling novel where Turkey declares war on Europe and marches to Berlin and all. It's so crazy it's ridiculous.

You read insulting comments on the internet? You feel your country is being rejected? Suck it up. I'm fucking French, I've seen much more gratuitous insults from other countries, from neighbors like the UK, though especially from Americans.

Finally, the whole reason why this conversation started is because you implied Turkey doesn't want to join the EU. Well that link you gave here shows the contrary.

true,foul-mouthed-lawyer,null,null,"One thing that should be said before I try to answer your questions is that the French usually don't know much about their own Revolution, since it's extremely bloody and convulsive, with a political history that is unbelievably complex.

Not much has entered popular conscience beyond the *Prise de la Bastille*, the *fuite à Varennes*, the victory at Valmy, and the death of the royal family. Things get much simpler, and thus better known when Napoleon starts to gain power.

**Robespierre**

He has retained a reputation of integrity and his nickname of ""The incorruptible"". He is considered to be one of many fathers of the Revolution that eventually ended up, as many others, being eaten alive by what he had created.

The Terror itself is more seen at the result of political immaturity in a country that hadn't yet learned to rule itself. Similar episodes happened later in Russia, for example. We have inherited a healthy distate for political hysterics.

**Lafayette**

He was a military hero in the US independance war. In the early years of the Revolution, he became a leader of the « *monarchiens* », the political ""party"" that wanted a constitutional monarchy on the British model.

And he proved himself to be politically inept. The *monarchiens* lost hard, he went back to the Army and lost some battles, eventually defected to the Prussians before he was brought back to Paris to be judged and beheaded.

He spent almost 10 years in the worst jails of Prussia. After his return, Napoleon hated and distrusted him. He remained a political figurehead for democracy in his later years, but was largely ineffectual.

He ended up being a massive loser, which no one likes, hated on the right for losing the Monarchy and hated on the left for not being a Republican...

**Marat**

He is considered to be responsible for the September massacres, one of the bloodiest part of the Terror. He was a demagogue and an extremist that excited bloodlust through his newspaper and remains an example of journalistic irresponsibility. Mostly hated and despised.

**Jourdan**

I had to look him up, as he is unknown beyond historians of the period. He seems to be just another of the many violent sadists of the times. A brute and a killer allowed free ~~reign~~rein [Edit: sorry, English is only my third language] by the events.

**Louis XVI**

Widely considered to be weak and incompetent. Politically, his two main failures have been:

1. his inability to control his younger brothers who were agitating for power since they had almost no chance of succeeding to the throne. They allied with the hardline conservative factions and managed to have the king dismiss the two prime ministers who could have saved the royalty's bacon before the Revolution started, Turgot and Necker.

2. his lack of understanding how the unceasing speeches at the successive assemblies from the *États Généraux* onwards would drive the members through fear towards more and more desperate measures.

In hindsight, he could have led through peaceful reforms and failed at several breakpoints, 3 times before the Revolution and at least 5 times during its early years.

**Danton**

More corrupt than Robespierre, less than Mirabeau. Almost as irresponsible a polemist as Marat. Caused his share of massacres, but ended up losing a political fight to Robespierre, and his head as a consequence. He is remembered for his love of life, contrasted to Robespierre's ascetism.

Media in the West was privately owned, but there also were (and still are) state-financed TV and radio stations like ARD, ZDF and Deutschlandfunk.

In the DDR media was controlled and funded entirely by the government. Examples of newspapers are [Neues Deutschland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Deutschland) and [Junge Welt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junge_Welt). TV stations were part of the [Deutscher Fernsehfunk](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Fernsehfunk). 

People would watch DDR TV stations mostly for movies, but news and propaganda like [Der Schwarze Kanal](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_schwarze_Kanal) wasn't taken seriously by most. One station that was generally well-liked was [DT64](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DT64), a youth radio programme.

Some, if not most Eastern Germans would watch West German TV. This was possible in most areas except for the very Eastern part of the country, due to the limitations of terrestrial antennas. Officially it was forbidden but not strictly enforced. Although you wouldn't talk about it to people you either didn't know or you knew where Stasi spies.

I remember making a cardbox ""TV camera"" when I was about 6 or 7. I painted the ARD logo on it since I knew it from watching TV with my parents. They had me replace it with the DDR1 logo when they found out, for fear of me being seen outside with this thing.

Europe's kneejerk reaction to the crisis, due to the arbitrary deficit limits we have agreed due to German economic fantasies, of quickly lowering spending to match the fall in revenue was what caused the crisis to become endless and a horrible tragedy for people's lives.

2. Lots of websites &amp; guidebooks about that. I live in Paris, but my favorites are Rick Steves (in English) and Guide du Routard (in French) which always come up with interesting and cool stuff. Also, buy the Pariscope (40 cents) which comes out every week on Thursdays and has info about everything going on in Paris. Also I think Timeout Paris in English has re-started. Here's their website:
http://www.timeout.fr/paris/en

My favorite areas for tourists are Montmartre (west of Sacre-Coeur and place du Tertre), the Marais (Place des Vosges and north to République), and Saint-Germain between the river and Jardins de Luxembourg. But Paris is lovely everywhere. I just discovered the Butte aux Cailles area (a mini-Montmartre), the Parc Montsouris and Cité Universitaire, and Mouzaïa, a lovely area east of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont.

3. I'm interested in WWI too. There's a new museum (opened 2011) of the Great War (the French call WWI the Grande Guerre) in Meaux, east of Paris (and home of the famous mustard): 

http://www.museedelagrandeguerre.eu/

It might be worth renting a car to get around. Meaux is an hour by car from east Paris, and Château-Thierry is near there too. Verdun is a couple of hours further east, and driving lets you appreciate the countryside and see why the Germans and French came to a standstill there. It's an amazing place and if you're interested in WWI, pretty overwhelming.

The British, who spent a lot more time at war 1914-1918 than Americans did, have great tours to the Belgian and northern French battlefield sites. 

Here's a good website to start looking: http://www.military-discussion.com/forum/index.php?topic=805.0

4. There has been an explosion of burglaries and pickpocketing in Paris since June 2011. The pickpocketing is the work of young children, mostly girls, who are gypsies from Romania. (The Romanian government has sent 30 Romanian cops to help the French cops deal.) French law is absolutely ineffective at stopping criminal children; they can't keep them off the streets, so the kids pretty much do what they want. Basically, keep your eyes open, don't feel you have to be polite to anyone who approaches you aggressively (just ignore them), and especially be careful of kids who come up asking you to sign a petition, telling you they're deaf (they're not), saying you've lost something, they've found something of yours, they're hungry, selling small trinkets, etc. Just stay away from them at all times. In the metro, watch out for people who walk through crowded cars with their hands down low. Be especially careful at metro Châtelet, Franklin Roosevelt (Champs-Elysees), the Louvre, and the Eiffel Tower areas. Just in general, be careful. Paris is not dangerous, but these kids are bad news.

Oh-- also, never leave your telephone or bag where someone could grab it, even if you are sitting right next to it, as in an outdoor cafe or on the bus. At present iPhones are the number one thing stolen in Paris and thieves will grab them right out of your hand and take off running.

Me la sono posta anche io. 

Mi sembra che il punto centrale sia dell'articolo sia questo: 

&gt;«di sinistra» è chi pensa che la società sia costitutivamente divisa, perché al suo interno giocano sempre interessi contrapposti, prodotti da contraddizioni intrinseche.

Apparentemente la destra ""americana"" (ultra-liberista, che segue la scuola economica di Chicago, e a cui credo che per lo più appartenga anche Giannino), non sembrerebbe essere ""di destra"" ai sensi di questa definizione, in quanto il conflitto (del mercato, dell'economia, della concorrenza fra imprese) è un po' il fondamento di tutto il suo pensiero. Il conflitto viene celebrato invece che osteggiato, ma la sua esistenza non viene negata. 

Però, pensandoci meglio, si tratta di un conflitto *individuale* (fra imprenditori, fra società, etc.), non di un conflitto sociale. Il conflitto sociale, nella destra ""americana"", se non viene negato, viene ricondotto a distorsioni nel mercato dovute all'interferenza dello stato: se lo stato non intervenisse, il mercato aggiusterebbe tutto: chi lavora diventa ricco, chi non lavora diventa  povero e tutto andrebbe per il meglio. Non viene contemplata l'ipotesi del lavoratore che si fa il mazzo ma che per ragioni che non può controllare (situazione sociale svantaggiata, sfruttamento) rimane povero.
Mi sembra quindi che si ritorni nella definizione di ""destra"" di wu-ming:

&gt; «Di destra», invece, è chi pensa che la nazione sarebbe – e un tempo era – unita, armoniosa, concorde, e se non lo è (più) la colpa è di forze estranee, intrusi, nemici.

Il nemico sarebbe quindi lo stato, e chi ritiene che lo stato debba avere una qualche funzione economica.

Monti d'altra parte non so se lo definireri ""di destra"": prescindendo dalle buffe categorie della politica italiana attuale, forse potremmo collocarlo nella tradizione popolare/democristiana: non so se effettivamente sia una tradizione ""di destra"".

Ingroia non ho idea di cosa dica.

Quella di wu-ming è un'analisi molto interessante, e non mi viene in mente un esempio in cui si dimostri palesemente falsa.

&gt;For the European Union, Jan. 1 2014 is going to be a potentially charged day. It's the day that Romanians and Bulgarians will be given free, unlimited access to the European labor market. Both countries have been full members of the EU since 2007, but under the terms of accession, they were not to be given full freedom of labor movement for a transitional period of seven years.

This is silly, we're talking about the labour market, what's wrong with them applying for jobs elsewhere in the Union?

&gt;The mood is particularly tense in Great Britain. Next week, a by-election is taking place in Eastleigh for an empty seat in the House of Commons, and the governing Tories have markedly ratcheted up their rhetoric against what they have dubbed ""welfare tourism.""

Sounds to me that the problem here is their welfare programme, not the free movement of people.

&gt;""We're not tough enough right now about people coming from the other side of the world who decide to use our health service,"" Prime Minister David Cameron recently stated. ""They haven't contributed in their taxes. They should pay when they use the NHS,"" the National Health System.

Then make it so that only people who pay their taxes get to use the NHS. Is it really that difficult?

&gt;And British Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has thundered against other Europeans who ""use the free movement rules just to travel around, looking for the best benefits they can get."" 

What's wrong with people travelling around? Doesn't that actually help the economy?

As for people looking for the best benefits they can get, that happens not only with Eastern Europeans but with everybody! It's only human nature for people to seek out the best opportunities, if those opportunities are living at the expense of others, then it's the system and the laws in place and not the people that are wrong. By that logic, freedom of movement of British citizens should be restricted within the UK itself, I mean, what if they use that freedom to travel around and look for the best benefits they can get?

&gt;""So here we stand, staring at the oncoming train, but … utterly impotent,""

Leave the tracks and isolate yourself then, you're free to leave the EU and gun down those who try to make it across the channel.

&gt;With this ""potentially huge political and social disaster hurtling down the tracks,"" the paper warned, Cameron and his government are standing, ""frozen in the headlamps, waiting for the crash in January.""

Damn, it's as if we were scapegoating all the evils on society on a select foreign group of people.

&gt;The story is accompanied by a photo of a group of downtrodden Roma standing in front of a dumpster.

I also really don't enjoy being around gypsies but I'm pretty sure these won't be affected by the free movement of labour.

&gt;Britain isn't the only EU country where politicians are raising the alarm. In France, the extreme right has taken up the issue in an attempt to mobilize voters. After the Socialist Party government of President Francois Hollande moved in autumn to expand the number of fields in which Romanians and Bulgarians are permitted to work within in the country, from 150 to 291, Marine Le Pen of the Front National (FN) party described the move as a ""scandalous decision, especially given that France is already suffering from mass unemployment.""

Really? Is this the criticism being raised? Do the French want even more protectionism? ""French jobs for French people""?

&gt;Given a high unemployment rate that may reach a record 10 percent by mid-year, unions are also eyeing with suspicion the arrival of potential labor-market competition from the east. The government itself is divided on the issue. The French Senate, with votes from the Socialists and the opposition, squashed a motion by the Green Party to eliminate the restrictions earlier than planned, in autumn. 

It's a strange world when it's the Greens the ones that are more economically liberal.

&gt;Meanwhile, in Germany the debate is being carried out under the slogan ""poverty immigration.""

Just like it happened back when the USA was a new country, they suffered so much from the poor masses that emigrated there, worked hard and made a living for them and their children.

&gt;But there's a lot to suggest that the removal of the last remaining labor market barriers will change the situation considerably. At Germany's Labor Ministry, officials are fond of pointing to the experience of lifting labor market restrictions for citizens in neighboring Poland. At the beginning of 2012, Polish nationals were given unrestricted access to the EU labor market, but there was no sudden flood of immigration. Most of the Poles who wanted to immigrate to other countries already had.

Hey, look, evidence that lifting the restrictions wasn't harmful.

&gt;The fixation with 2014 ignores the fact that many Romanians and Bulgarians are already permitted to work in Germany. In addition to academics, this also applies to skilled workers and job trainees. And any Romanian or Bulgarian has the right to set up his or her own business in Germany or work as a freelancer.

lol

&gt;The sole remaining labor market barrier applies only to unskilled workers; currently they can only enter the country for six months at a time as seasonal workers.

Nothing will happen, why are people so upset?

&gt;A similar gradual transition is also taking place in France. Since last autumn, most employment sectors have been open to the southeastern Europeans. Highly bureacratic procedures for obtaining a work permit have also been simplified. All a Romanian or Bulgarian worker has to do in France today is to pay a €700 tax and obtain permission from the local municipality. These steps are intended to make integration simpler for the new immigrants.

Now this is getting funny, it's like ""we don't like you but we like your money"".

&gt;As such, those Romanians and Bulgarians looking to leave home for Western Europe have had that possibility open to them -- and many have taken advantage of it. More than 1 million Romanians currently work in Italy; in Spain there are 900,000. Linguistic similarities have made those two countries the favored destination of Romanians. According to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, there are 209,000 Romanians and 121,000 Bulgarians currently living in Germany.

How is this bad?

&gt;How many of those are Roma is not documented.

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

&gt;The migration will continue for as long as there is a lack of jobs and career opportunities in the two countries. But the governments in Bucharest and Sofia are warning against scaremongering. The debate in Britain in particular has been met with incomprehension. ""Most (Bulgarians) who sought jobs in Britain have already done so,"" Bulgarian Ambassador to London Konstantin Dimitrov told the Evening Standard last week, discounting fears that a flood of his countrymen would show up in the United Kingdom in 2014. He added that ""some politicians have been guilty of unenlightened propaganda.""

Hey, I think I'd say the opposite, I'd say ""the weather in Britain sucks and they'll look at you differently, please stay here because it's your taxes that pay my salary"".

&gt;The conflict is reminiscent of the immigration debate which erupted in Germany when the EU was expanded eastwards in 2004. The cliché of the ""Polish plumber"" who would drive German tradesmen into bankruptcy ultimately became a symbol for virulent xenophobia. Warsaw was able to successfully co-opt the fear in a humorous advertising campaign using a muscle-bound plumber to encourage foreign firms to invest in the country.

Not only the Polish but also the French and the Danes and the Bavarians and the Berliners and the people across the street, they're all competing with me and may drive me, the honest German small business owner, into bankruptcy! Please protectionism!

&gt;In Germany, the current discussion centers around who should be liable for the costs of integrating the newcomers. Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants are not, on average, unemployed more often than other Eastern Europeans.

I wonder why these people are so upset?

&gt;But Roma present schools, municipalities and charitable organizations with unique challenges. Local governments are complaining that they are now being made to bear the costs of EU expansion, concerns that the federal government in Berlin have thus far ignored. Instead, Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich has demanded that the EU make money available for the integration of Roma into their native countries.

Yep, the EU is enforcing the burning of books written in other languages, my name has been changed into EU694911673 and they've sacrificed my younger brother to Huehueteotl.

And the unity of the UK was only achieved with the force of arms, and even so part of Ireland broke off.

And the unity of the USA was only achieved with killing the natives, giving citizenship to all to came there, seizing parts of Mexico, buying Alaska from Russia and staging a coup to incorporate Hawaii.

There's a problem (specially with certain dialects) in which this kind of object is mixed with the ""objeto indirecto"" (or ""complemento indirecto"") which must be preceded by ""a"" in almost every case, this is usually explained as ""who or what receives the action"" for some verbs it's obvious (I gave a book to Juan) but with others like rescue the thing is harder: in the phrase used: in ""rescatamos a personas"" is personas direct or indirect? The solution can be obtained by making the phrase passive: ""Las personas son rescatadas"" if it becomes the subject (as in this case) it's direct, if not, indirect.

To be more precise, only radio and TV stations were directly funded by the government. Newspapers were funded by the political parties and the mass organisations (for instance, Neues Deutschland was the SED's nationwide newspaper, and the Junge Welt was the newspaper of the FDJ, the youth organization). In practice, this of course made little difference.

&gt; Officially it was forbidden but not strictly enforced. Although you wouldn't talk about it to people you either didn't know or you knew where Stasi spies.

Receiving West German radio and TV broadcasts was never technically illegal in the GDR.

In the early GDR, however, there were several ""raids"" where members of the FDJ would try and find antennas that could receive Western broadcasts and destroy them or turn them so they would only receive Eastern broadcasts. This was the reason my grandparents had their antenna under the roof instead of on top of it.

In the 80s, it was not uncommon to have your newly-built Plattenbau apartment with ARD and ZDF (later RTL and Sat.1) coming over the shared antenna system.

Though if I remember correctly, the army had separate regulations and it was actually forbidden for them (although as you said this was not enforced in the later GDR).

Insomma se nella mia zona ci sono fonti d'acqua in abbondanza (es.: piccola zona disabitata di montagna) c'è davvero un significativo problema di impatto idrico del mio personale consumo d'acqua?

true,Haaveilla,Zespagne,Espagne,"J'ai habité 6 mois au Vietnam, donc j'ai pu goûter quelques trucs dans le genre.

* Mon #1 des trucs immonde, c'est la sauce ""mam tôm"". Une odeur à réveiller les morts. On dirait du jus de cadavre mixé. C'est en fait une sauce à base de poisson fermenté. Du nuoc mam version Iron Man. Déjà d'apparence, [ça donne pas envie](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wanderingchopsticks/3175393937/) Ca se mange pas directement, on y trempe du tofu ou de la viande crue par exemple. Le tofu se gorge de sauce et n'a pas de goût particulier, donc ça permet d'apprécier au mieux l'horreur qu'est cette sauce. Le truc qui te pourrit ton haleine pour la semaine. Tellement hardcore que mêmes les vietnamiens n'en mangent pas souvent (ils disent que ça s'apprécie mieux si c'est mangé rarement, mon oeil ouais !)

* Les œufs couvés/œufs de 100 ans : ça c'est presque classique, assez connu. Autant les œufs de 100 ans si on est dans le trip produits périmés pourris, bon ok. Mais manger un œuf avec un fétus de poussin mort dedans... J'ai croqué, j'ai recraché.

* Dans le même genre que les pattes de poulet, il y a les yeux de poissons (les vietnamiens se battent pour les manger car c'est bon pour la virilité, ou ça porte bonheur, je sais plus... En tout cas c'est croquant-gluant, étrange mais c'est pas bien grand donc vite avalé). La viande de boeuf avec plein de morceaux de tendon/cartilage, quand on connait les côtes de boeuf, mâcher du caoutchouc c'est pas l'éclate (surtout qu'il faut manger ça avec des baguettes, c'est encore plus drôle ! Les têtes de canard c'est pareil, le ratio dépiotage/viande est trop faible, mais bon ça occupe si on s'ennuie à la fin du repas.

* Les viandes exotiques. J'ai mangé du serpent (très bon, on en boit même le sang en shot avec de l'alcool, et la chair est préparée en plein de plats), du rat (la viande était pas très goûtue et c'est plein de petits os), du chien (assez bon, le goût est assez fort, c'est dans le même esprit que le bison par exemple) et du chat (très très bon, viande super tendre !). En fruits de mer il y a aussi des trucs marrants, un machin que j'avais jamais vu et dont je ne connais pas le nom, une sorte de mélange entre un concombre de mer et du corail en tubes (goût super fort, les amateurs de fruits de mer adoreront, j'ai détesté) et surtout de la limule, sorte de crabe préhistorique énorme.

* En dessert je vous propose du gâteau au durian (fruit légendaire qui pue tellement qu'il est interdit d'en transporter dans le métro à Singapour) ou alors des bonbons au maïs (c'est pas mauvais du tout, mais la première fois ça surprend les papilles ; il y a aussi du jus de maïs). Et pour faire passer tout ça, de l'alcool de riz fait maison par l'oncle du frère de celui qui vout fait manger tout ça. En général suffisamment fort pour faire passer tout et n'importe quoi. Si vous êtes un invité d'honneur on vous sortira peut-être la bouteille spéciale dans laquelle on a fait mourir un serpent pour donner un peu de goût.

It's not that bad, but it's not great. The problem is also that France(and many other EU  nations) relatively low purchasing power per dollar.

The thing is, economists who use it to attack France are really shooting themselves in the foot : we have a higher ""productivity"" than Chinese and a higher GDP per capita. Yes, we could work more, but I don't see how it threatens the economy if we don't.

I think the real issue is productivity on the low end of manufacturing(aka a lot of manufacturing). If the Chinese are 10% of the price but 20% as productive, you're making 2x as much for the same total productivity. 

Western nations have been losing out a lot on the low end of production. Unions have slowed the flow, but they are slowly but surely losing the fight. 

Eventually we will be left with high end manufacturing(aka they have trade secrets they don't want to give the Chinese). Many workers won't be qualified for it, and there will be much less of it to go around.

So how will we shape up there? When the US, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden etc are all fighting for a significantly smaller portion of the manufacturing, how will we measure up?

We need low end jobs. Everyone does.

Pretty much at the other end of this shopping street is were all the pubs / small clubs are. Follow this street until you reach ""Untere Strasse"" (to your left). This is the place to be. Here are all the bars. Have a drink at the Weinloch there. Truly traditional German bar, but pretty fucked up alocoholic people in there. But it has got it own charme. Nothing really special about the other bars... They are bars. Not good not bad.

Perhaps start your evening at the brewery called Vetter. They serve substantial food and the brewing takes place right in the restaurant so you sit around all the kettles. This is also near ""Untere Strasse"". The same goes for ""Kulturbrauerei"", but they are a little off the center and quite a bit more up-scale. 

If you need American support, go to the Irish pub ""The Dubliners"". Mostly English-speaking people and sports, mostly soldiers. ""Coyote's"" and ""Club 1900"" are also pretty American. All located on said Fussgaengerzone. There you'll find tons of people to connect with.

I second, what ApocaLiz said about getting into legal trouble as an exchange student. Just in case you do it anyway, here are some tips.

Do not, under any circumstances smuggle something into Germany from the Netherlands. 
If you do weed the first time, do not do it alone, have someone who has done it before with you.
Do not do weed when you are drunk. At the very least not the first time.
Do not do weed when you have to be in public afterwards.

Do not buy weed yourself. You will get srewed over and buying weed is illegal. Consumtion is not. 

The best way would be to see who of your classmates has done weed before. Chances are they know how to get some and maybe have a dealer they trust. 

Only do weed with someone you yourself trust and be aware, that people will notice it when you are stoned, especially when it is your first time.

&gt; There are more than half a million Polish-born people living in the UK. Some 6,390 of them, according to this DWP report from last year, are claiming the JSA (note: Jobseeker's Allowance). A further 4,390 are receiving ESA (note: Employment and Support Allowance) and incapacity benefits and 800 take advantage of lone parent benefits. 

**""Moocher"" %: roughly 2%**

Conclusion: irrational fears, masking other problems in some countries.

true,keepthepace,FRAN,France,"We have more agreement than I suspected.

Indeed, what employers think when they talk about productivity takes the salary into account. It would be closer to GDP per capita / average employee salary. The number of hours worked is irrelevant but for low end manufacturing, it is feasible to raise the number of hours to raise the produced output quasi-linearly.

I honestly don't see why border tariffs are so frowned upon. I'm all for the restriction on the circulation of goods, people, information and even capital, but here we have a clear imbalance caused by the inability for Chinese people to come work in countries like France for ""low"" salaries.

Put a tariff on Chinese import until they lift the restrictions Chinese workers travels. Put also similar restriction on transits of capitals (a bit harder, I agree)

In the longer term, I believe that the rise of China made us forget what was supposed to be the industrial revolution of the 21st century : automation of production lines. It is arriving in China. Robots are becoming cheaper, and the amount of cheap-as-dirt labor is quickly depleting. The world will have to face this much bigger challenge very soon. And I do think that it will hit China the hardest. 

Whether or not it is the reason of the jobless recovery the US (GDP back to the pre-crisis level, unemployment still at 8% vs 4.5% pre-crisis), it is a problem that will come. It will cause a dramatic change in our societies. I personally believe that the obvious solution is that, as production becomes capital-intensive rather than labor-intensive, to fund social efforts (healthcare, retirement, etc...) with taxes on companies' benefits (instead than on wages, as is currently done in many states) and to put tariffs in place to not let tax haven offer an easy dodge.

I am really sad that this program is considered extremist and far-left by most. Our friend from Titan would label it as a nutty socialist ploy that would destroy competitiveness, but I see it like a pretty pragmatic approach to very practical problems.

true,DisregardMyPants,UNSA,United States,"&gt;I honestly don't see why border tariffs are so frowned upon. I'm all for the restriction on the circulation of goods, people, information and even capital, but here we have a clear imbalance caused by the inability for Chinese people to come work in countries like France for ""low"" salaries.

&gt;Put a tariff on Chinese import until they lift the restrictions Chinese workers travels. Put also similar restriction on transits of capitals (a bit harder, I agree)

1) The problem comes when other countries put the same tariffs onto your country and you can't export anything properly.

2) Cheap supplies make for cheap production at home. If the raw materials and parts are cheap, you can have manufacturing at home that you couldn't otherwise.

3) Tariffs will only help inside your own country. The prices will still be higher that average(by far) internationally, so you will have huge problems exporting.

I don't know the ""by the books"" answer, but that's off the top of my head.

&gt;Whether or not it is the reason of the jobless recovery the US (GDP back to the pre-crisis level, unemployment still at 8% vs 4.5% pre-crisis), it is a problem that will come. It will cause a dramatic change in our societies. I personally believe that the obvious solution is that, as production becomes capital-intensive rather than labor-intensive, to fund social efforts (healthcare, retirement, etc...) with taxes on companies' benefits (instead than on wages, as is currently done in many states) and to put tariffs in place to not let tax haven offer an easy dodge.

I believe in education and trade schools. If your problem is workers are not qualified to do labor that can pay a living wage in the country, the solution is to increase the quality and difficulty of labor they're capable of.

If your job is being taken by a 14 year old Malaysian kid, the problem is that your job could be *done* by a 14 year old Malaysian kid. We need to concentrate on getting a workforce skilled enough to avoid that.


&gt;I am really sad that this program is considered extremist and far-left by most. Our friend from Titan would label it as a nutty socialist ploy that would destroy competitiveness, but I see it like a pretty pragmatic approach to very practical problems.

I just don't see it as that simple. If you make it too difficult to launch and expand(which requires profit) a business in your country, you're screwing yourself 20 years down the road when your former behemoths have shrunk(as all do) and you have nothing to replace them.

There was a tad of insanity in perpetual rent-controlled leases, which is why that kind of leases were discontinued by law decades ago (but already-existing contracts could not be broken). Having a rent-controlled tenant may end up costing money (not merely ""not making more money"" but actually costing money) to the landlord. It makes sense if you see it from the landlord's side.

Most rent-controlled eviction take refuge in very slight breakages of contract by the tenant (such as paying 1 day late), usually due to tricks on the landlord side (such as changing the paying account every month; forcing the tenant to pay in person, then the landlord not being home to receive the payment, etc). 

99% of those cases could have been avoided by the tenant accepting to pay a decent rent: if the average price in the area for Aurelia's apartment is 1000 EUR and she is currently paying 126 EUR, agree to pay 600 EUR. But no, rent-controlled tenants refuse to pay one dime more and even brag they are paying very little rent. IMHO it's the tenant's own attitude what causes this kind of problems and the tenant is fully aware he is walking on thin ice.

In this specific case, Aurelia Rey is not accepting the same-price apartment she is being offered in the city outskirts: she is willing to accept to move to another apartment for the same price BUT only if it's in the city center (the most expensive area). That shows malice on her side.

I believe that today, a country can put tariffs against another one on a product that received too many government subsidies (and if I recall correctly both our respective countries manage to get away with that on agricultural products, which is a dickish move IMHO). 

Just add a rule to make it possible for a country to raise a tariff against a country that does not allow the migration of workers (and hence the real competition on wages and living conditions)


About automation : I have already encountered that proposal, but I have a problem with the premise that human needs are infinitely extensible into tertiary products. I do believe it to be false. Some people claim to already have their needs fulfilled and now just wish to work less instead of earning more. This is a growing trend in France and I believe it exists in the US too.

I also have another criticism : there *is* currently a jobless recovery. It is proven that the economy works well (GDP rises) without creating new jobs. What if a moderate level of unemployment was actually not a problem for a country? I do know some people who I know would benefit the society by *not* working instead of doing their job, and I doubt that 5 more years of education can really fix them.

&gt; but they come here to launch businesses instead of their home countries. I don't think there's enough respect for the damage this tendency will do in the long run.

Software patents and healthcare costs are two reasons why I would have never considered starting my software company in US. In the end, it also depends on what your philosophy is. If you have the american dream and believe it still exists, go to US. The few libertarians here feel quite lonely, US attracts them.

true,SumoSizeIt,null,null,"Just found it on Google while I was looking for 'American' style dining on my study abroad. It's an Aussie-themed place, but short of the accent it was just like dining in an American pub. (And for whatever reason, American pub or bar in Vienna is almost always a place that has no food, only serves hard alcohol, and probably has a cowboy hat on display somewhere - at least that was my experience)

The place I loved going was 1516, it was a sports bar that was about 50/50 locals/expats depending on what game was playing that night. We went there to catch American football games. The staff was diverse, and definitely spoke German as well as they did English.

Nearby was Flanagans Irish Pub, which was similar to 1516 but tended to be a bit heavier on the soccer. Still, we saw a few tables of American and British businessmen on football nights.

There seems to be a consensus between polls that his party is not going anywhere close to ""winning"", and that it has in fact been very close to disbanding during the last year.

Edit: what could be labeled as ""winning"" for his party is that the Democratic Party fails to reach majority in one or two key regions (Lombardy and Sicily), thus preventing it to have the majority in the Senate, which is assigned on a regional basis.

You (meaning everyone outside Italy) should realize that he could be bad, but his agenda and motives were not significantly worse than those of the whole centre-right coalition that backed his government.

true,Jackopo,ITAL,Italy,"Well, two reasons:

* his opponents suck
* he has a lot of media power

As for the image, he owns one of the major bradcasting company in Italy, Mediaset (well, technically *owned*, now it's owned by his son, but there's not that difference), and two newspapers (Libero and Il Giornale) which support him (especially the two newspapers, which are pretty terrible and many times published defamations of any kind). Also, Berlusconi has rhetorical skills way better than his opponents, all but Beppe Grillo.  However, personally I don't think this the main reason, because there are actually public spaces also for his opponents.

His opponents are (survey results), in this moment:

* The Democratic Party (~30%), which in the past wasn't able to pass most of the laws, first of all the one about conflict of interests, and have many internal conflicts: it's made of former communists, former socialists, catholics, and it isn't able to take any important decision and follow it without splitting in internal factions. They try to mitigate this by avoiding to take position on everything and with primary elections, and failed various times because the winner of them wasn't the one supported by the party leadership. Moreover, some people in the party (like the catholic Bindi or the old leader D'Alema) are still in the party despite never being elected in primary elections and are, for various reasons, not appreciated by the people voting left parties. So, it's difficult to believe in this party, which still is the greatest opponents in terms of number of votes. Also, recently there was a scandal about a bank (Monte dei Paschi di Siena) which is linked with the party. 

* Sinistra Ecologia e Libertà (Left, ecology and freedom) (~4%) is a more ""leftish"" party lead by the socialist Vendola has a lower trust, probably because in the past years and still today communist and socialist parties were busy with internal fights, divided in a plethora of different parties still too attached to the image of communism and fighting themselves.

* Movimento 5 stelle (five stars movement) (~15%) is lead by the comedian Beppe Grillo and is basically a group of people never been in politics, he is populist, use a direct and aggressive language, is very active on the internet and collect the votes of people who otherwise abstained. It's their first election and it's difficult to predict what will they do 

* Mario Monti (10%~) is the current PM, is a professor who was chosen to ""save Italy from the damage made by Berlusconi"", and has a bad reputation since he put a lot of taxes. Moreover, he's allied with UDC (~2%) and FLI(~1%), two former Berlusconi allies which shamelessly changed side.
* Rivoluzione civile and Fare per fermare il declino are two small parties which probably will not overcome the minimum amount of votes.

So, basically the problem is not Berlusconi but his opponents who are stuck with internal fights and hypocrisies.

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","Why does it ""annoy"" you? I didn't say people on here are supersmart, or *extremely* well educated (in fact, I didn't use the word ""intelligent"" at all), just that, as a group, we're probably higher educated than the average. 

But you know what? Don't just take my word for it. Let's look at the r/europe survey (for the link, see the top of this page). According to that (informal) survey among 2941 redditors, a whopping **74%** of redditors on here have a tertiary degree/degree above high school. 

Now, even if we don't count the second answer of that survey (because ""A-Level, Baccalaureate"" is perhaps not known terminology in all European countries, and was possibly misunderstood by some respondents), we get to **47%** post-high school degrees on r/europe.

Now let's compare this to:

&gt;For the EU-27 as a whole, in 2010 just over one third (**33.6 %**) of 30 to 34 year olds had completed tertiary education. 

&gt;In 2010, an average of **25.9 %** of the EU-27 working age population (25 to 64 years) had attained a tertiary level of education.

He had a post up a few days ago that [tried to answer this exact question](http://italpolblog.blogspot.hu/2013/02/berlusconis-comeback-bersani-monti.html). 

I thought it offered an interesting take that covered, but also went a little beyond, the obvious, important points (his media power, anger over Monti's austerity policies, the left's divisions and self-defeat, the longing for a charismatic leader). For example, Italy's traditional conservative lean, which neither the left-wing parties nor the technocratic, 'modern', economically liberal and Brussels-oriented Monti can satisfy. And this:

&gt;The [message] that succeeds is certainly not subliminal and is almost explicit. Berlusconi's Italy is one where the rules are flexible, at least of some, the furbi or smart guys. Tax rules, building rules, business rules. While Monti and Bersani are boring and threaten to make rules and apply them. Last week Berlusconi complained at prosecutors who arrested the Finmecanica chief for paying bribes. He said that in some countries bribes were an essential part of doing business. He meant India but could have been referring to some parts of Italy. Then he backtracked and said he didn't mean it… but the message was clear. Yesterday he called the judiciary ""a cancer"" - strong language but he had called some of them ""a metastesis"" in the past.

Italy's partial tradition of political and economic corruption and mafia power extended to mass tax evasion and a general bending of the rules by many in the middle class and at the bottom as well as those at the top. This tradition victimized the country and everyone in it - but it also had many beneficiaries and willing participants.

true,marnevs,null,null,"Hi, your list seems quite spot on. I've been twice in Barcelona, and that's what I went to see myself. I live in Valencia thought, so my tips will be all for Valencia:

Try the 100 Montaditos food chain. It's quite difficult to explain to a foreigner, but it is cheap, good and has beer pints at one euro!!

About Fallas: 



1st. Make sure you have NOW accommodation for Fallas. City population doubles in Fallas and Hotels and Hostals are full.
2nd. Valencia's Aquarium is one of the bests, and there is queues for it's tickets. I've been in San Diego's, Barcelona's and one in Holland. And Valencia's is only second to that in San Diego. If you get tickets for the aquarium, get tickets for the IMAX (Hemisferic), as it's cheaper this way. And go to the Mall ""El Saler"", which is nearby, for lunch. Overall, do not miss the Dolphins Show.

3rd Valencia is a very safe city. Still, you are a tourist, and a prime target for scammers and pick pockets. Avoid to look tourist (sandals with socks, rly, rly?) and keep your belongs under watch, and so on.

4th Watch your drink. It is quite easy to overdrink in Fallas. Drinking is good, but overdrinking makes you lost the fun.

5th Taxis are not expensive and do not usually cheat. A normal run should be around 8 to 10 euros, maybe 12. If it is more, ask for a receipt or call the police. As I said, it is not normal to be cheated, all I'm giving you is precautions just in case.

6th Paella. Paella is the traditional food of Valencia. Still, in the city you will probably fall for tourist traps. If you want to try the real paella and not a tourist trap, look for one of the following restaurants: Pa, Sal i Oli; El Rall; La Pepica; L'estimat; El Yuso; Bill should be around 20€ per person.

7th Agua de Valencia or Valencia's Water. It is a drink mix of Cava, Orange Juice, Vodka and Gin. Best place ever is Los Borgia, in Caballeros Street.

8th Café Bombón. Is a presentation of coffee tipical of Valencia, with condensed milk.

9th Place to buy food: Mercadona supermarkets. By far, best prices and quality.

10th Watching Fallas. Do not wait to the 19th of March, as the 19th of March Fallas will be break down for burning. Get confy shoes and be ready for hours of walking and queing. And watch for pick pocketers.

11th Fireworks and Firecrackers. Beginning the 1st of March, there will be a huge Firecrackers show (Mascletà) every day at 13:00 in the Hall Square (Plaza del Ayuntamiento). Also, beginning the 12th of March, there will be a big Fireworks show every night at 12:00 in the Old River.

12th The Old River and the New River Turia. In 1956, for the last time the river Turia flooded the city. As it has happened periodically since the Romans founded the city the year 138 BC, it was decided to make a HUGE civil construction work and make a new way for the river. If you are an engineer or into civil works is worth to watch. The old one became a garden, very nice to walk, 4 km long in the city, 12 km long upriver.

13th Orchata or Orxata or wathever. It is a sweet drink, quite a milk shake. Worth to try.

Dunno, that's all I can think about Fallas right now.

Beside Fallas, you have a 2000 old city to watch: Serranos Towers, La Lonja (a XIV Century Gothic Building Stock Exchange), the Roman Forum, Pius V art museum, Ceramic Museum, the University, the Aquarium, the BEACH and Sail Port...

Well, I hope it serves you. Good luck and nice trip!

It's worth noting that your statistics gain are benefited a lot be certain groups included in the European figure being heavily excluded from the reddit figure. And I don't mean by choice. Lots of Eastern Europe lacks English skills, internet access and in some circumstances computer access. Those factors make it impossible for them to join in on reddit, but they still continue to lower the European educational average, which might be somewhat unfair.

Basically what I'm saying is your statistics are effected by extremes for the European statistics, but not for the /r/Europe statistic. This isn't a big problem, wanted to point out that it might not necessarily be an apples for apples comparison.

**Additionally** there are a lot of Europhiles on here who aren't from the EU (Russians, Australians, Americans, Balkans,) who, when all counted up can make up a large portion of those who answered the survey.  

Again, not a huge problem, but it makes the statistics harder to compare.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt; Let's assume there's a large number of people with college degrees without Internet.

True, but usually internet correlates with wealth and education correlates to wealth. Basically people without education and/or from poorer countries are probably poor(er) so lack amenities associated with wealth such as internet connections. Basically I'm making the argument reddit is excludes most of Eastern Europe due to wealth distribution. If Eastern Europe become better, on average, educated then for what ever reason internet access would probably increase too and thus reddit membership. So there might be a pocket some where or the possibility of a pocket some where of highly educated people without access to internet, but it's unlikely as the correlation usually works the other way around.

 It's a weak argument for what I was trying to use it for and the difficulty I'm having in explaining it is testament to that.",0,1361579486,null,0,false,0,c8k1izq,t3_191j1a,t1_c8k1izq,t1_c8k1697,null,1431378294,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

We got accustomed to low quality material that treated us like morons and everyone was happy because they were against Berlusconi. We deluded ourself thinking that ""not evil"" equals ""good"" and gradually lowered our standards year after year.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"It seems to me that a monetary union relies on the ability for unemployed people to move easily from depressed to buoyant areas, because there's no longer the tool of monetary devaluation. For that to happen in a meaningful way, I think a lingua franca is necessary. Learning a language up to fluency is a major endeavour. If you grow up in Greece, your options are:

* Learn English. Allows you to work in Britain and Ireland (about 15% of the job market).

* Learn German. Allows you to work in Germany, Austria, parts of Switzerland (about 20% of the job market).

* Learn French. Allows you to work in France and parts of Switzerland and Belgium (about 15% of the job market).

So without a lingua franca, in the best case scenario, you have to be fluent in four languages to get access to half the job opportunities. Or, in the worst case (for the smallest national languages), you could learn Portuguese, Danish, Swedish, Latvian, Estonian, Lithuanian, Slovene, Slovak, and Hungarian, and get access to about 10% of the opportunities. This is obviously not workable.

Also, you need to be able to speak the same language to have a serious shared political debate across the continent. Even with major efforts from papers to report multilingual news stories, they just do not have traction with the general population. About 10-20% of people read these stories, and talk about them, the rest are not interested.
