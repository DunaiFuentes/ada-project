They should teach english at church, maybe you would understand it better.

The orthodox religion is the religion that's hurting Romania the most. 


&gt;How taxes work

You just went full retard. 

Education is necessary. 

And if the beaches are cleaned, the more people will come, the more money they will spend, the more money that comes back into the budget via VAT and other taxes. 


Religion is optional. It's a choice. And the only thing people get in return is the blessing of a bearded shaman.

Fact. The priests are full of gold. They drive expensive cars. http://i.imgur.com/fPlmaKl.jpg ,http://i.imgur.com/hxn4ZdM.jpg , http://i.imgur.com/2Fu4lVU.jpg . Now, if they were some ordinary interlopes, I wouldn't mind. But they've made a vow of poverty. 

Facts? I have better things to do than to search for news articles showing the involvement of the orthodox church with loan sharks, tough guys, and pretty much every type of interlopes that can be.

Bis diesen Jahres war es Pflicht für jedes Kind in der Schweiz, Zugang zu einem Schwimmbad zu haben und die SLRG bot sich als Vermittler zur Schulung an. Eine gute Sache. Bis die Gemeinden ""plötzlich"" kein Geld mehr haben. Kein Wunder, die haben sich per Ausbau der Agglomeration gesund gestossen und jetzt müssen sie die Infrastrukturkosten selber berappen. Den Kindern wird es weggestrichen. Situationen wie in den Staaten, wo man je weiter zentral zur Stadt wohnend wahrscheinlich nicht schwimmen kann, nur geographisch anders gelagert. In New Mexiko kein Problem, aber im Wasserland Schweiz halt gefährlich und peinlich. 

Ich vertraue auf die normale Geschichte, dass Kinder miteinander spielen und dann automatisch zusammen die Freizeit verbringen. Wenigstens sind die Sommerkurse in den Städten immer noch vorhanden.

Braindrain ist ein rotes Tuch für mich. Die Schweiz gehört in die Gruppe der Arsch\*\*\*-Staaten, wo sich der Common Wealth, Hong-Kong, Singapur etc. angeschlossen haben. Braindrain auf Kosten aller anderer, Hauptsache Wachstum. Die Intelligenten wegschnappen und den Verbleibenden Waffen liefern, fieser geht es echt nicht. Und dann auch noch die Rohstoffe wegschnappen, die hier für die idiotischsten Konsumschweinereien verbraten werden. ""Die Armen Einwanderer"" greift hier einfach zu kurz. In der Schweiz leben 50% Ausländer. Wenn hier die Politik etwas beschliesst, dann sind es auch Ausländer, die das unterstützen. Politisch kann sich jeder betätigen, Unterschriften sammelt man hier ganz, ganz schnell. 
Heute wird es dem überwiegenden Teil der Menschen nicht mehr ""erlaubt"", irgendwohin zu gehen, sondern sie werden genötigt. Es herrscht kein Krieg, keine richtige Unterdrückung, keine Naturkatastrophen. Sondern banale, böse, wirtschaftliche, systematische Benachteiligung. Einwanderer sind für alle Seiten schnöde Manövriermasse geworden.

Well, I understood it perfectly. I know what internal devaluation means, and how it works. I just found your whole comment pretty pointless and dictated by your political prejudices. Salaries [have already fallen in Spain](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/spanish-wages-depressed-eurozone-crisis), and the [trade balance is currently positive](http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/08/01/inenglish/1375365679_421664.html). This has also been a [bumper year in tourism](http://www.thelocal.es/20130726/spain-sees-record-tourist-numbers-in-june). So there goes your whole argument about competitiveness.

Yes, competitiveness fell during the years prior to the crisis. But this was, to a large extent, precisely the **result** of the real estate bubble. The overheating building sector drove up salaries across the whole economy, especially for unskilled workers. Teenagers left school early to work in building sites, because it paid far better than graduate jobs. Taxes actually **fell** quite significantly during the ten years prior to the crisis, and the public sector nevertheless had some of the healthiest accounts in the EU, with consecutive budget surpluses and low state debt.

The Spanish banking crisis **really** is the illness, not a symptom. Or rather, the previous housing bubble was. Is the euro to blame for that housing bubble? Well, it may have facilitated it, but the same bubble would have arguably happened even without the euro: it also happened in the US, just like it happened in Sweden 20 years ago, or in Japan before that. Two of the European countries most hardly hit by the crisis are Iceland and Hungary, both very definitely not euro countries. Britain is far from unscathed by it (and its real estate market still looks pretty frothy), whereas Belgium, with its unstable, fissible politics, terrible administration, horrible taxes **and** the euro, is pottering along quite nicely. Germany greatly improved its competitivity during the euro years, why shouldn't other countries be able to do the same, by the same means?

The whole ""blame the euro"" chorus gets boring after a while, especially if nobody bothers to contradict some of its faulty assumptions.

Finally, you asked why it has been taken Spain longer to recover than it took Sweden. The reason is pretty simple and has nothing to do with the euro: the sick Spanish banks didn't accept how badly hit they were until last year. The bank rescues could only start there and then.

A few friends and family members did ultimately come to me and ask for advice, but they typically didn't want to pursue their cases for various reasons, e.g. cost or the irritation involved. In general, private clients have a tendency to just not care that much about their case as soon as it gets a bit tricky or time consuming. I prefer working with business clients since they seem to have more at stake. 

That said, I love helping private clients and many of those cases have been the most satisfying for me.

Ce que dis Mélenchon:
&gt;La résolution 1973 de l’ONU concernant la Libye doit être fidèlement appliquée. Son objet est clairement délimité. Il s’agit de mettre en place une zone d’exclusion aérienne, actuellement effective, pour protéger les civils libyens. La résolution 1973 n’a pas d’autre objectif et exclut clairement toute autre intervention militaire.
&gt;[...]
&gt;Pour ma part, comme beaucoup de ceux qui ont approuvé la mise en place d’une zone d’exclusion aérienne, je ne soutiendrai pas davantage que par le passé une nouvelle guerre de l’OTAN.

Ce que tu as montrer c'est qu'il y a une porte de sortie légale pour les frappe arienne dans la résolution. Quel rapport? (notons au passage que le ""donner des armes aux djihadistes"" est joyeusement passer à la trappe)

la position de Mélenchon est clair et non contradictoire, tu peux te moquer de lui pour appeler à l’application de la résolution si ça te chante, mais il faut être d'une putain de mauvaise fois pour dire qu'il a été à un moment pour les frappes ariennes ou la distribution d'arme.

Part of me thinks they are just struggling to make a living like the rest of us, but then I represent a client who is being harassed (invariably, it's a 28 year old single mother working for 8 EUR an hour) and I realize that they are often personally aggressive people who have a disregard for the harm and emotional suffering they cause.

I have an exceptional success rate against Abmahnanwälte and I think that is not because I'm necessarily the world's greatest lawyer, but because these guys go after clients who give in easily. If a client is represented they will usually file the case away under ""too much effort"" and move on to the next scared target who pays up front.

I don't view cases like this as a ""win"", as I disagree fundamentally with the copyright laws currently in place and hope they change. But I am pleased when I am able to help someone. I generally try to negotiate very low hourly rates for my out-of-court efforts in these cases, especially since I can relatively quickly and efficiently deal with Abmahnungen thanks to the experience I have with this constellation.

true,peripatos,UNSA,USA,"I think lawyers generally all make about the same amount if they are in solo practice or partnerships. Employee lawyers make around 2.5k-5k per month, depending on geography and firm size.

Big law is another beast, of course, but most small firms turn over as much revenue per lawyer as a big law associate earns in wages in a year. And, of course, from that EUR 110.000 money pot, at least 40% goes to taxes and social fees, so I'd say, once again, that the income relationship is more or less equivalent.

And working in one's own practice, one has more independence and fewer hours.

Big law partners, on the other hand, can easily earn more than EUR 500.000 per year, if not significantly more. In fact I would guess that the income is open-end. I worked at a big international firm in Hamburg for roughly a year and a half, but that was in 2007 and things have changed.

Keep in mind, all law offices have huge expenses as well in order to provide clients with availability, professional file management, quick response times, all that copying and printer paper that's needed for making everything in triplicate for courts and opponents, etc.

But it's a good living, without a doubt.

Bear in mind that judges earn maybe 3.5k per month starting.

I can't think of a Greek-made English words at the moment(1), but I can think of a Greek-made French one: I was surprised to learn that *montagière* in French is not the table that people use to edit film (and by extension, the computers that do the same job today). 

In Greek, we say μονταζιέρα / montazyéra, which I thought it was a direct French loanword. 

Μοντάζ/Montáz from Fr. montage and -ιέρα/-yéra, a suddix signifying a tool that does whatever the root signifies (it became a productive suffix after becoming independent from either Italian (eg fruttiera) or French loanwords (eg jardinière)). With that possibly-Italian-possibly-French suffix we created completely new words like αλατιέρα / alatyéra ""salt shaker"" (άλας / álas = salt).

(1) Unless you want to count ερκοντίσιον/érkondísyon, from En. air-condition*er*. The -er was dropped when the word entered Greek, but that's not a new creation, rather a morpheme that meant nothing in Greek was dropped (and a word ending in something other than a vowel, -s, or -n in Greek it's (usually) altered to end in one of them. Phonotactics).",0,1375978463,null,0,false,0,cbjkczx,t3_1jymd1,t1_cbjkczx,t3_1jymd1,null,1429901176,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

Dann gibts aber auch 1000 Konflikte um die man sich gleichermaßen kümmern müsste um dem ganzen irgendwie gerecht werden zu können. Warum also Israel? Weil Israel ein westliches Land ist, weil die BRD und etliche weitere westliche Staaten Israel unterstützen. Und das missbraucht wird.

Wolves are naturally fearful of humans, probably because they don't have the sheer fuck-you-upable power of a bear, or even rottweiler for that matter. 

Attempting to keep a tame wolf the same way you keep a dog is beyond stupid. What keeps big, tough dogs from being impossible to keep is that they have been bred for thousands of years to *want* to work with people. If you train them properly, give them boundaries, they will learn and are unlikely to hurt anyone. Wolves haven't been bred to work with people. You can try to train them, give them boundaries, etc but they won't be particularly reliable. So you end up with the animal the size of a german shepherd with sharp teeth, serious predatory instincts that you can't train and has lost the biggest thing that makes wolves not *that* dangerous - its fear of people. You're basically asking for someone to lose a kid. 

Anyway, while teaching kids what to do if they see a wolf is probably a good idea if there are wolves in the area, unless the wolf in question is rabid or tame it probably doesn't pose the same threat as a bear.

In fairness though the entire ""mainstream"" US media has run with the line that Snowden is a fugitive criminal/possible traitor and almost none have even proposed the idea that what he did was right. Sure one or two dissenting voices emerged, but the general line is that Snowden is guilty of everything he is accused of - no media outrage over the various prejudicial things that have happened to him is proof of that (passport revocation, international travel ban etc). I don't think they are using the sort of emotive language the article suggests, but to imagine they are anything other than on the NSA's side is a bit naive.

They are focusing on the drama of Snowden, but that drama is all about how he is ""evading justice"". If the press supported him or were even neutral, the drama would have a totally different slant (i.e. it would be about evading injustice)

I have to say your final bit is what most Europeans consider the American foreign policy mindset. The idea that apologising for intrusively spying on all your citizens, and citizens of allies is ""meek"" is a bit strange to be honest. In America it seems there is no room for apology and accepting responsibility as a feature of strength. It's like how Republicans talk about how you should never apologise for **anything** America does - well, you might think it would be meek to apologise, I think not apologising shows America up as everything its opponents imagine it to be (as an international power); rude, overbearing and unapologetic. Americans might not care what we think, but that mindset is just an extension of the one that leads them to asking ""Why do they hate us?"". It shows complete contempt for not only your allies but your own citizens too.

true,JunCTionS,null,null,"Alhambra: **buy the tickets online**. Every time I go there is a BIG line of people that will only get to see the gardens and not the royal palaces (unless they were lucky enough to get the very few entrances sold there at 6am). The official website for this is: http://www.alhambra-tickets.es (there are other which will only sell you ticket+guide, you can check this is the official one by going through the town hall's official webpage: www.granada.org then the tourism department and the Alhambra section).

You will have to choose a specific hour to get into the Nazrid Palaces, this is the jewel of the Alhambra and you will only be able to go in once. Choose any time you want and be there on time (very strict). The rest of the visit you can arrange to do before or after.

As for the Granada Football Club, they are first league and have been so for the last two seasons, but both times they barely survived being demoted... so they play against the famous teams (Real Madrid and Barcelona) but they are always expected to lose (unless Ronaldo does a self-goal, hehe). Tickets are usually hard to come by.

Other things I would suggest, go to the science park... maybe I'm just a big geek, but it is totally worth it. And of course there are many other historical sites to visit (like the cathedral). So consider buying a ""Bono Turistico"" which includes the Alhambra, Cathedral, Science Park, 1 day of the Sightseeing bus and 9 trips on the local bus system (a 6€ to 14.4€ value if you use single tickets or a card to get around). Although in any case, maybe a day and a half is too little for much more than the Alhambra+Flamenco. Maybe the sightseeing bus will help to get more seen while taking a rest from all the walking in the Alhambra, and if you get on it at 6pm for the first time, the ticket is good until 6pm the next day, so it might be good to come down from the Alhambra.

And since I'm already on a roll here, and you'll be there on a Saturday, I'll just continue giving tips. Flamenco is a must, but there are many options. Le Chien Andalus (as suggested per /u/ander-san) is very good and authentic (not a tourist trap), however it is a very small place with no seats assigned and people will gather a long time before entering to get the better seats... it's a bit uncomfortable. I would suggest something more institutional, the Teatro de la Chumbera. 

The Teatro de la Chumbera is very far away (walking, but through a very inaccessible part of the city which happens to be the flamenco heart, called the Sacromonte), and tickets cannot be bought online, so as soon as you get to Granada I would suggest going to the (Teatro Isabel la Catolica)[http://www.granada.org/inet/wagenda.nsf/wwcetod/Teatro%20Municipal%20Isabel%20la%20Cat%C3%B3lica] (also very beautiful and worth seeing a play inside if you're into that), and there you can buy a ticket for any saturday of the Chumbera's season. Try to get a seat about five or six rows up in the left side of the theater (left as in your left when you are seated down), you will be in for a beautiful treat. To get there you can either try to catch the #35 local bus that go there or walk, but it is very far uphill and you could easily get lost. Taxis sometimes refuse to go up there because it's also hard for them to come down later. To come down you can walk down, and it is a very pretty walk, but this is the ""rough"" part of the city, so be aware of your surroundings and don't carry something like a bag on a strap or a camera, where someone can run by and try to snatch it from you (most of the robberies there are like that, if they don't succeed at snatching the good they'll just keep on runnning like the cowards they are).",0,1375980033,null,0,false,0,cbjkzxv,t3_1jkmc9,t1_cbjkzxv,t1_cbfn3nv,null,1429900878,2,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,2

That word exists in English. The phonological adaption doesn't change the fact that it derives from an actual English word and retains the same meaning. It's not a *pseudo*-anglicism, but a plain ol' loanword.

Ibid. Actual English word and same usage.

Dictionaries link it to ancient Greek ""a(ŋ)grízo"" ([α(γ)γρίζω](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B6%CF%89) = ερεθίζω). Personally not sure. Now, if we had a text corpus we could see when the word entered the lexicon (pre- or during British colonialism) and early forms that were similar to the original word.

Interestingly that's not what I read: [Whalers and watchers battle in Iceland](http://mg.co.za/article/2011-07-20-whalers-and-watchers-battle-in-iceland)

Whale watching and whale tourism has been one of the most rapidly growing sectors of tourism during the last decade and is already worth billions globally. 

&gt; And whales are just delicious! They taste quite similar to beef, with a finer texture.

Yet that's not a very good argument to [kill endangered species](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_whale#Human_interaction) for export to Japan with government subsidies despite the global ban of international trade of endangered species, to turn them into [dog food](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/19/iceland-fin-whale-hunting-greenpeace) as the demand for the meat is [too low](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/iceland-broke-japanese-whale-meat-230537748.html) even in the Japanese market, and to undermine global efforts to conserve them.

I do believe that Iceland could hunt mink whales sustainably for their own consumption, but it's ironic that the meat in Iceland is served to curious tourists as a traditional local dish, while only very few Icelanders themselves (5%) eat it regularly. Apparently the whaling industry depends on tourists eating the whales to the extent that they demanded the removal of ads with slogan [“Meet Us Don’t Eat Us”](http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/our-work/whales/meet-us-don%E2%80%99t-eat-us-campaign-take-whale-meat-menu-tourists) from Keflavik international airport.",0,1375982959,null,0,false,0,cbjm7ru,t3_1jxyo8,t1_cbjm7ru,t1_cbji67k,null,1429900310,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

- How much would you be willing to pay per month for other people's irresponsible behavior? 10euro? 25Euro? 100Euro? ...200 Euro?

second question

- would you give a flying fuck if, (for example) because you smoke, your fellow people in your country might democratically decide you are not to receive *any* expensive treatments that are plausibly required as a result your behavior? Can you visualize dying in your 50s, extremely sick, with minimal care - because voters are unwilling to pay for your self-damaging behavior?

The fin whale hunt is more controversial, but a recent survey by icelandic broadcaster Stöð 2 showed that 18%  oppose with around 60% in favour. [Source here](http://img.visir.is/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=XZ&amp;Date=20130630&amp;Category=FRETTIR01&amp;ArtNo=130639943&amp;Ref=EP&amp;NewTbl=1&amp;item=1&amp;MaxW=800&amp;NoBorder=1) and [here's the text](http://visir.is/mikill-meirihluti-landsmanna-hlynntur-veidum-a-langreydum/article/2013130639943). 

Fin whales aren't actually eaten in Iceland at all, all the meat is exported abroad. It's impossible to buy them anywhere. There's one company (Hvalur hf) which catches them, all the other ones just hunt the minke whales which are only used for domestic consumption.

&gt; I do believe that Iceland could hunt mink whales sustainably for their own consumption, but it's ironic that the meat in Iceland is served to curious tourists as a traditional local dish, while only very few Icelanders themselves (5%) eat it regularly. Apparently the whaling industry depends on tourists eating the whales to the extent that they demanded the removal of ads with slogan “Meet Us Don’t Eat Us” from Keflavik international airport.

Whale is definitely a traditional dish over here. Traditional doesn't have to mean that it is commonly eaten nowadays though, or how often do you eat smoked reindeer? Surströmming is a traditional Swedish food but nobody eats it regularly. And what does regularly mean anyway? That you eat it every week? Whale is also generally a seasonal food, it's very popular for barbecues in the summer for example.

And my original point stands, if you, through dangerous behaviour, for example rock climbing, fall and injure yourself causing permanent disability, should you be granted disability allowance? You chose to do it, you chose to put yourself in a more dangerous situation because you enjoy the experience, how is that different from smoking or drinking *should* smoking and drinking ultimately cause you health problems?

To my mind, it's not. You can't force people to live carbon copy, dull ""productive"" lives for the benefit of the health service, because that road leads to micromanaging everyone's existence.

So we pay more taxes or we deny certain treatments. I expect a mix of both, I'm pretty happy with that, you enjoy life by doing some risky things, fair enough, if it screws you over you can't say you didn't know. And most people do know, they choose to do it anyway.

true,ze_redditor,null,null,"As someone rapidly nearing his second state exam (sigh), I can answer this : you need two exams to become a lawyer. 

The first one is achieved after a 3-6 year long university education. Law is an undergraduate degree in Germany, so you'd typically start that right after school, when you passed your Abitur. Usually the requirements to get into law are pretty low at german universitys (compared to stuff like psychology or medicine for instance) 

At the end of university (and usually after doing about a year of exclusively learning for it) the first state exam awaits you: there you'll have to pass several written tests and an oral exam. Note that the University ""trains you"" for it, but the state you studied in will hold the exams. This is basically the theoretical part of the education. Edit: there is also a smaller exam held by the university, where they will test you about the specialization you picked during your studies. This ""Schwerpunktexamen"" accounts for about 30 % of your final grade (1. Staatsexamen) . 

Your grade will be solely based on your performance in these final written and oral exams. 

You can  do nothing with that university degree though, since all legal professions require a second state exam. 

You need to go through a 2 year long clerkship, where you are trained in various legal professions: typically you'll work with a civil judge, some kind of executive government office, a prosecutor or criminal law judge and an attorney during the various stages of this practical education. At the end of this, another exhaustive written and oral exam awaits you. 

After you're done with both exams, you're basically  free to be a lawyer if you'd like. You could also become a judge, prosecutor or work for the government - but these jobs usually require certain grades. 

If you speak german : Google ""schwerste Prüfung der welt"" and check out the first result. I have to say : I doubt it is the ""hardest exam in the world"" but it's torture none the less ;)

Food here is cheap cheap cheap, especially if you stick to basics. Competition amongst Aldi type discounters brings the prices down pretty damn low. Basics like milk, eggs, cheese, flour, pasta, etc. are always super cheap, esp. when you buy the house brand.

Cell phone bill can be cheap if you get prepaid. Do you have Verizon or one of the providers with SIM cards? If you have a SIM card provider then you can bring your phone with and stick a prepaid SIM card in it. I used to have T-Mobile and paid €40/month, but only got 200MB of data. Right now I'm using Congstar (subsidiary of T-Mobile) and pay €10/month for 500MB of data and then 10 cents/minute. They have all kinds of add-ons, like a landline flatrate, 100 free minutes, etc. (prices for calling from a cellphone to a landline are different sometimes I think...)

Internet isn't too bad. I pay €30/mo but I think the contracts change all the time. Take a look here: http://www.kabelbw.de/kabelbw/cms/internet-und-telefon/produktuebersicht/internet/

Mannheim VRN public transport pass is 60 or 70€ I think. I just ride my bike or drive everywhere, so I'm not 100% sure.

Rent should be cheap, ask your employer about paying for Maklergebühren or look for Provisionsfrei and with an Einbauküche. I pay 800 including utilities and a parking spot for 90m^2. I think for someone who only needs a studio or whatever would pay a lot less. Also depends on what part of the city.

Anything else is bending the rules. If you want to give it to your Thai colleague to avoid customs, better try yourself to get it through customs. Both actions are the same tax or customs avoidance.

Russia was constantly attacked from the West since the Teutonic Knights Invasion, almost became a province of Poland in the early 17th century, Napoleon's Invasion, etc. Everyone was involved in the business of building empires. It's just that Russia came out on top. Some Eurpean countries are still grateful to Russia for confronting, containing and finally marginalizing the Ottomans, which were quickly expanding into Europe. Russia helped liberate Greece, Bulgaria and The Balkans from the Ottoman rule, without subjugating those countries itself. When Russia conquered Finland from Sweden (another former formidable imperial power), the Finnish language, Finnish culture - were almost extinct. The great Alexander (aka Tsar Liberator) promoted finlandization, leading to an unprecedented cultural revival. No matter how much the Finns hate the Russians for 20th century stuff, they still have a big statue of that Tsar in middle of their capital.   

Should Russia be blamed for the Bolshevik/Soviet crimes? 60% of the Bolshevik core were not Russians and were sponsored by foreign interest, mainly the German Empire and American Jews.

Just an FYI from the other side of the table: I do not recommend doing this. Chances are nobody will notice that a door from the basement is missing, but technically this is considered to be property of the owner of the building. So if you have a particularly eagle-eyed caretaker/hausmeister, he might inform the landlord about the missing door (or a nasty neighbor could take care of this). Essentially you're stealing a door and might or rather will be held accountable. (Even if the door in question is stored in a cellar compartment assigned specifically to your apartment, the landlord will end up one door short)

I recommend doing this by the book: Inform your landlord of the damage and offer to take care of the replacement or pay the costs for replacing it. If you are living in an old building with solid wooden doors and the door in question is not entirely destroyed, a repair by a carpenter might be cheaper than replacing it entirely (be sure to compare prices).

If you mess with your landlord and he finds out, it will not be taken kindly and just might bring in all sorts of trouble. Even if it only means that he will be especially picky with potential minor damages when taking the apartment back.

Edit: You can check the basement or attic for a door that might fit and point that out, maybe you'll be in luck and the door isn't needed or planned for and you get out with no cost at all.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; We entered the IWC on the understanding that it would regulate whaling. When it turned out it had no intention to do so we left. 

Actually it was the IWC's idea of ""regulating"" that originally led to the collapse of the whale populations and the whaling. This happened very quickly and took only some decades to do after WWII, as great whales are very slow to reproduce.

In the IWC the whaling nations consistently set their quotas too high and then exceeded even those. And when one species of great whales had been hunted down to the brink of extinction (some were) the industry moved to destroy another species under the IWC ""regulation"". 

And in the '70-80s after all species of great whales had already collapsed, the heavily subsidised whaling industry had to move to less profitable smaller species such as mink whales. Yet even in the '80s when the IWC actually started regulating the whaling nations continued killing the rarer and rarer great whales. 

So *evidently* IWC's regulating did not work and had not worked, whole species had collapsed, industries had collapsed, and those nations that still continued whaling could only do so with heavy public subsidies - not sane.

The enviromentalists didn't kill whaling, the whaling industry and its regulatory organ did by not regulating. Hence the ban. 

&gt; The little we to hunt is mostly not endengared and completely sustainable and if the IWC won't regulate that hunting we'll just do it ourselfs, we did give them decades before we gave up.

Iceland (or more accurately the only company that does whaling in Iceland) has once again moved on to kill endangered great whales. That's because great whales are bigger catch and more profitable to kill than small mink whales. Despite the global ban they have killed more and more year after year. 

And the meat isn't even consumed in Iceland. There's actually surplus of it in Iceland ([Years-Old Whale Meat Remains Unsold](http://grapevine.is/News/ReadArticle/Years-Old-Whale-Meat-Remains-Unsold)). It gets exported to Japan despite the ban of international trade of endangered species. 

Japan does kill some fin whales under the auspices of 'scientific' whaling, but a lot less than Iceland kills. Funny thing is that because the demand for whale meat is so low even in Japan the market is saturated and Japan already has thousands of tons of fin whale meat in deep freeze. They even feed the endangered species to dogs as people consume so little.

Yet Iceland (or more accurately that Loftsson guy) kills even more of those great whales only to export the meat into Japan.

&gt; A flat-out global ban in the face of scientific data showing sustainable hunt is possible isn't accepteble.

The ban was the only thing left to do as IWC's ""regulation"" had so spectacularly failed. 

And whaling does not even make much economic sense as it needs subsidies. Even in Japan it's whale watching, not whaling, that turns actual profit.",0,1375994222,null,0,1375994456,0,cbjqzw7,t3_1jxyo8,t1_cbjqzw7,t1_cbjgaaq,null,1429898008,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"It's good to look at this from multiple perspective, but I really don't think the athletes are too important in this. It sound ridiculous saying that athletes aren't important to the Olympics but hear me out. 2,600 athletes went to the 2010 Vancouver Olympics (according to Wikipedia at least). 

I'd wager that the number of Russians subjected to legal and institutional discrimination is well above that. Based on the percent of LGTB in liberal societies like the UK and USA which puts the gay population at between 3 and 5 percent that means that there are ***very roughly speaking***  7 million Russians subjected to such discrimination. This figure is very rough, but no matter which way you look at it the number of LGTB Russians is going to be at least seven digits long. That rather blows the number of Olympic athletes out of the water at a meagre two thousand six hundred. That's a drop in the ocean compared to the millions of persecuted LGTB Russians. 

Further more, the Olympic athletes are simply being denied a great luxury, all be it a luxury they have worked hard to obtain. But a meagre luxury and honour non the less. Where as what is happening to LGTB Russians is not simply that they are having a few luxuries removed but that they are having their quality of life ruined and by some interpretations being denied their rights (The European Convention on Human Rights, of which Russia and the whole rest of Europe bar Belarus is a signatory, enshrines that people have a right to marry and to a family life and LGTB people in Russia have neither).

So what I'm saying is that the athletes are pretty irrelevant in this regard. Yeah, it's regrettable that they might not be able to compete, but that is a sadness that is easily justifiable compared to the lively hoods of the Russian LGTB community which is faces far worse hardships and in far greater numbers. 

I'm not saying that I do think the Olympics should be cancelled all together, but I don't think that the issue you raised should be a reason to not cancel.

Edit: Whilst this post is still only seconds old I'd like to also point out that boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics is also, in the eyes of Stephen Fry, a preventative measure to stop the situation for a minority group deteriorating even further. Stephen draws a lot of parallels with Hitler and the Olympics then and how it legitimised Hitler in the eyes of many people, including Germans whilst he was persecuting jews. Stephen Fry makes the argument that allowing Putin to host these games would do the same and thus justify the things he is doing both to Putin and to his electorate as well as the international community. The idea is to let the whole world know that this must be stopped and then the pain that LGBT people have suffered must be reversed and prevented from getting even worse.

As for non LGBT Russians being ok and even advocating discrimination, that doesn't make it ok and stopping the Olympics would help stop the spread of such kinds of thinking.

Là on peut déjà plus être d'accord.

&gt;On peut en débattre mais vu qu'on est déjà en train de légaliser des GPA réalisées à l'étranger par arrêté, je ne comprends pas trop ce qu'il essaie de démontrer à part qu'avec une volonté suffisante juridiquement tout est possible. Les lois ne s'écrivent pas toute seules, il faut une volonté de le faire, de les entériner et de les appliquer. Et même si la technique de la pente glissante est bien évidemment oratoire, elle n'est pas dépourvue de toute réalité.

Si je me souviens bien, l'argument se basait sur l'avis qu'avait formulé la CJUE et le Parlement Européen en matière de mariage : chaque État est souverain, on n'intervient pas pour juger d'une discrimination. Leur argument, c'était, ""maintenant que le mariage est légalisé, la doctrine principale Européenne qui est de détruire toutes les discriminations va forcer la France à adopter la PMA et la GPA"". En tant que pro-PMA/GPA, j'aurais tendance à dire que je m'en fiche, mais c'était quand même vachement faux. Ce n'est pas comme ça que fonctionnent les décisions de la CJUE.

&gt;Il se sert de son ""autorité"" pour prouver des situations qui n'ont pas tellement à voir avec le juridique mais bien plus avec la morale.

Des exemples ? Je suis pas assez assidu sur son blog (ou pas assez observateur) pour voir à quoi tu fais références.

&gt;Enfin, tu utilises d'exemples qui sont pas les plus représentatifs de ce que je critique. J'ai été beaucoup plus choqué du deux poids, deux mesures sur le sort des manifestants eux-mêmes. Alors qu'il semblait plutôt remonté contre les pratiques sécuritaires de la police depuis qu'il a commencé à blogger, il était content que les manifestants de la manif pour tous en fassent les frais comme s'ils étaient personnellement ( même ceux qui ont 18 ans ) responsables d'un phénomène qui a lieu partout ( USA, UK, par exemple ) et qui comprend l'automatisation des peines, le fichage généralisé ou la répression des opposants politiques. C'est cela qui le discrédite fondamentalement.

Non. C'était plus une jubilation. Les anti-mariage gay, sont, dans leur grande majorité, des UMP/FN tendance réactionnaire, pro-surveillance etc. Il a quand même montré dans sa note sur le jeune qui avait été arrêté qu'il avait été victime de la loi Dati sur la récidive, et que la loi avait été mécanique (première résistance à une arrestation =&gt; résistance une deuxième fois = récidiviste, traité comme tel).

Franchement j'ai jamais entendu ces arguments.

&gt;chaque État est souverain, on n'intervient pas pour juger d'une discrimination

A priori, la beauté de la jurisprudence CEDH, c'est qu'elle est indépendante du statut ( droit de tous les hommes ) et la qualité de la jurisprudence CJUE, c'est qu'elle s'intéresse à des directives liées souvent au marché commun, donc plutôt en rapport avec la réglementation des relations contractuelles commerciales. 

Pas trop de rapport en effet avec le statut du mariage. Mais sait-on jamais.

&gt;Des exemples ? Je suis pas assez assidu sur son blog (ou pas assez observateur) pour voir à quoi tu fais références.

Je répondais à ce que tu disais sur la ""nécessaire"" adoption par le conjoint. Il n'y a rien de nécessaire, les sociétés s'organisent comme elles veulent selon leur propre appréciation de la situation. C'est peut-être pas l'avis d'Eolas mais il devrait arrêter de cacher son opinion, qui lui est propre, derrière des textes. Les constitutions se modifient, les traités s'abrogent.

from the article:

&gt;In theory, SovRoms were joint Romanian-Soviet ventures aimed at generating revenue for reconstruction,[1] and were created on a half-share basis in respect to the two states;[2] however, they were mainly designed as a means to ensure resources for the Soviet side, and generally contributed to draining Romania's resources (in addition to the war reparations demanded by the armistice convention of 1944 and the Paris Peace Treaties

Talking about religious tensions, the HCI affirms that some universities already adopted « concrete and peacemaking solutions » by proposing a national interdiction to avoid a « cacophony » of measures.

This presentation of the HCI's proposition of prohibition as a try to « apease » tension in universities is cynical, and wrong. Such a policy that incitites chauvines prejudices and facilitate repression of students' demonstrations promotes a reactionary athmosphere and a increase of attacks made against muslims in France. Taking specifically muslims as a target for a discriminatory treatment, these measures contradicts the fundamental constitutional principles, such as the neutrality of the State before religious affairs, a.k.a laïcité.

The HCI would, as a force of law, prohibit « in the classes, places and situations of studying and research of the public higher education installations. ». The HCI continues, by denying the revendications of universities that want their students to be able to follow dietary restrictions or religious off days.

Using the Savary law of 1984 that says that freedom of speech for students « must not hinder the educations activities and to public order », the HCI denounces that « some universities » are confronted at « demands of derogation to justify an absence, or to wear ostentatory religious signs... and the refusal of mixity by students and professors, the protestations of the content of the cursuses, at the exigence of the respect of alimentary traditions, the installation of praying rooms or rooms of reunion for communautary use... these issues did not disappear, instead they became banalized »

A quick overview of the dispositions of this prohibition clearly shows that it aims muslims students first and foremost. It is linked to a wide attack against the democratic rights of students. One disposition would allow universities to sanction acts of protestations by students, such as the occupation of a place.

The use of english words is mostly part of the street jargon vocabulary, except for older words like futebol (which sounds like the english word). English words regarding the office universe or any other professional jargon aren't street jargon either and can be used in a professional conversation. The only exception to this rule I can think of is the adoption of the verb **to scan**, ai. ""I'm going **to scan** this document"" - ""Vou **scanar** este documento"". This isn't very professional and certainly not an official word.

The Portuguese often adapt english verbs and make them sound portuguese - a street jargon example:

**Check out** that girl - **Checa-me** essa dama/duia (this one is pretty heavy street jargon).

Another street jargon example (a noun this time):

**Bitch** (when used to describe a naughty female) - **bitchoca** in portuguese (again, heavy street jargon)

Office jargon examples:

**PC (personal computer) (sounds like ""pee see""**) - in portuguese people often use this word but it sounds like **""pê cê"" (closed Es)**. It might not be obvious sounding to english native speakers.

**Email** (sounds like ee mail), in portuguese is called email also, but it often sounds like **""eh mail"" (open E)**, which may make the word not so obvious to english native speakers, but many people say it with the english pronunciation.

&gt;It's good to look at this from multiple perspective, but I really don't think the athletes are too important in this. It sound ridiculous saying that athletes aren't important to the Olympics but hear me out. 2,600 athletes went to the 2010 Vancouver Olympics (according to Wikipedia at least).

&gt;I'd wager that the number of Russians subjected to legal and institutional discrimination is well above that. Based on the percent of LGTB in liberal societies like the UK and USA which puts the gay population at between 3 and 5 percent that means that there are very roughly speaking 7 million Russians subjected to such discrimination. This figure is very rough, but no matter which way you look at it the number of LGTB Russians is going to be at least seven digits long. That rather blows the number of Olympic athletes out of the water at a meagre two thousand six hundred. That's a drop in the ocean compared to the millions of persecuted LGTB Russians.

&gt;Further more, the Olympic athletes are simply being denied a great luxury, all be it a luxury they have worked hard to obtain. But a meagre luxury and honour non the less. Where as what is happening to LGTB Russians is not simply that they are having a few luxuries removed but that they are having their quality of life ruined and by some interpretations being denied their rights (The European Convention on Human Rights, of which Russia and the whole rest of Europe bar Belarus is a signatory, enshrines that people have a right to marry and to a family life and LGTB people in Russia have neither).

&gt;So what I'm saying is that the athletes are pretty irrelevant in this regard. Yeah, it's regrettable that they might not be able to compete, but that is a sadness that is easily justifiable compared to the lively hoods of the Russian LGTB community which is faces far worse hardships and in far greater numbers.

&gt;I'm not saying that I do think the Olympics should be cancelled all together, but I don't think that the issue you raised should be a reason to not cancel.

&gt;Edit: Whilst this post is still only seconds old I'd like to also point out that boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics is also, in the eyes of Stephen Fry, a preventative measure to stop the situation for a minority group deteriorating even further. Stephen draws a lot of parallels with Hitler and the Olympics then and how it legitimised Hitler in the eyes of many people, including Germans whilst he was persecuting jews. Stephen Fry makes the argument that allowing Putin to host these games would do the same and thus justify the things he is doing both to Putin and to his electorate as well as the international community.

That rather blows the number of Olympic athletes out of the water at a meagre two thousand six hundred. That's a drop in the ocean compared to the millions of persecuted LGTB Russians.

So what? Attempting to stop the Olympics doesn't free these Russians from homophobic legislation. None of these LGBT people have been training for years for a once in a lifetime opportunity to do something world class. The Olympics are a platform for people to come together globally and compete, depriving athletes of this quite simply because of a political dispute is completely unfair. If safety is a concern, withdraw the LGBT athletes, as they are the only ones with a legitimate reason not to compete. 

&gt; Further more, the Olympic athletes are simply being denied a great luxury, all be it a luxury they have worked hard to obtain. But a meagre luxury and honour non the less. Where as what is happening to LGTB Russians is not simply that they are having a few luxuries removed but that they are having their quality of life ruined

Again, so what? I don't see how this is relative to the Olympics as it will not change Russian law. You are depriving one group of people who have specifically spent years of their life to compete at this specific event, just to make a political statement that will very likely make no difference at all. This is not fair. 

&gt; So what I'm saying is that the athletes are pretty irrelevant in this regard.

And I disagree. 

&gt; a sadness that is easily justifiable compared to the lively hoods of the Russian LGTB community which is faces far worse hardships and in far greater numbers.

Which boycotting the Olympics does precisely fuck all to counteract. 

&gt; I don't think that the issue you raised should be a reason to not cancel.

I don't think you've raised a single legitimate issue to actually cancel them.

The idea is to let the whole world know that this must be stopped and then the pain that LGBT people have suffered must be reversed and prevented from getting even worse.

Gambling the opinion of Stephen Fry comparing Putin to Hitler against the guaranteed disappointment and waste of all of the athletes time is not a worthy reason to shut down the Olympics. It's fairly clear that Russia does not give a shit what the rest of the world thinks.

Whenever I went to the games in Monaco there was always flexibility over where to sit, and as long as its empty and not the VIP section you'll be fine to sit there, but as the stadium is small every seat in the place has a good view, and perhaps the only stadium you'll ever go to where you know the players can hear everything you shout 

I'm not sure if its still the case, but when I was there after the games a good group of people would always walk down past the Fontvielle Harbour and down through the saint martin gardens before going off home or wherever. But then again that was parents and kids so not sure if thats relevant to you. There is a bar nearby that the fans would also go to en masse if thats more your speed.

It's not crazy--just different. You can make the apartment exactly how you want it, and not have to worry about having to live with old/broken beds, couches, etc. 

The kitchen doesn't have to be a big deal, when I was a student I went to the hardware store and bought one like this: http://static1.schoener-wohnen.de/thumbnails/galleryImage/0001/00000000001/45/29/45292_kueche-klein-inwerk1.jpg for about €300, had a fridge and everything included, and was totally fine for 4 years.

You don't need to go through one, but apartments can be hard to find in MA (= that's the common abbreviation for Mannheim, comes from the license plates) and if the landlord decides he doesn't want the trouble of finding someone to take his place and gives it to an agent, there's no way around paying him.

κι αν μπορείς και στους εχθρούς σου να σκορπίσεις το καλό,

αν μπορείς με μιας να παίξεις κάθε τι που ’χεις κερδίσει,

στην καταστροφή ν’ αντέξεις και να δώσεις κάποια λύση,

αν μπορείς να υποτάξεις πνεύμα, σώμα και καρδιά

αν μπορείς όταν σε βρίζουν να μην βγάζεις τσιμουδιά,

αν μπορείς στην καταιγίδα να μη χάνεις την ελπίδα,

κι αν μπορείς να συγχωρήσεις όταν σ’ έχουν αδικήσει,

αν μπορέσεις τ' όνειρό σου να μη γίνει ο όλεθρός σου,

κι αν μπορέσεις ν’ αγαπήσεις όσους σ’ έχουνε μισήσει,

αν μπορείς να είσαι ο ίδιος στην χαρά και στην οδύνη,

αν η πίστη στην ψυχή σου μπρος σε τίποτα δεν σβήνει,

αν μιλώντας με τα πλήθη τη συνείδηση δεν χάνεις,

αν μπορέσεις να χωνέψεις πως μια μέρα θα πεθάνεις,

αν στα ψέματα των άλλων δεν λες ψέματα κι εσύ,

αν μπορείς να μη θυμώνεις, αλλά μήτε και να κλαις

όταν άδικα σου λένε πως εσύ μονάχα φταις.

Αν μπορείς με ηρεμία δίχως νεύρα ή δυσφορία

αν μπορείς κάθε λεπτό σου να ’ναι μια δημιουργία

και ποτέ σου να μην μένεις με τα χέρια σταυρωμένα.

Αν οι φίλοι σου κι οι εχθροί σου δεν μπορούν να σε πληγώσουν

αν οι σχέσεις με μεγάλους τα μυαλά δεν σου σηκώνουν

αν τους πάντες λογαριάζεις μα… κανένα χωριστά,

αν μπορέσεις να φυλάξεις και τα ξένα μυστικά…

Where is convenient is going to be dependent on what terminal he's in, how much time he has, and whether or not he can exit the airport (this will be dependent on his visa status...if he's a US citizen he's fine, if he's from a country without visa-free access to the Schengen area, there might be some restrictions).  

The only restaurant in the airport I've eaten at was Käfer's, which pitches itself as a Parisian-style bistro but does have good German food (schnitzel, etc.).  It is a bit expensive, but any sit-down restaurant at the airport is going to be.  Skimming over the list, it looks like ""Deutsch"" is another choice for German food.

The best option, as someone else pointed out, would be the Paulaner at the fernbahnhof (long distance train station) next to the airport.  It's a very quick walk from Terminal 1 (and Terminal 2 isn't much further...for as big as it is, it's a fairly compact airport) and the food and beer are pretty good.  I haven't eaten at this particular Paulaner's, but it's a chain restaurant owned by the Munich brewing company of the same name and the ones I've been to have been pretty consistent.

At the last meeting of that kind it was decided that Germany was going to pay the reparations costs when its economy will allow it. Which meant virtually never. And that was that. Not sure how true the whole thing is though.

Either way the amount of patents, copyrights and scientists that the allies (mainly US) took from Germany right after WW2 are worth much more then any repair costs. They pushed the US from a relatively weak economy and cultural significance to a super power that it is today.

Tout cela signifie en fait que l'on se croit d'une intelligence assez sûre pour que l'aveu d'une incompréhension mette en cause la clarté de l'auteur, et non celle de son propre cerveau : on mime la niaiserie, c'est pour mieux faire le public se récrier, et l'entrainer ainsi avantageusement d'une complicité d'impuissance à une complicité d'intelligence.

I for one am neither a specialist in international law nor finance, but think that it's too easy to say that Germany (which Germany, btw? The FRG paid just about 3bn in reperations (IIRC), while the GDR paid several times more) has paid its debt and that the Greeks are just coming for *our* (well...) money. So I think turnusb's remark was quite right...

Immunity for example, should only cover certain things that can be considered part of the work. The only example I can think of right now is free speech in parlement (including e.g. hate speech etc). Certainly not tax evasion or the like.

I am also somewhat skeptical of paying people past employment, especially paying them for the rest of their lives. Although I can think of some reasons and situations where it may be justified.

And both of those together, although mostly the national governments, appoint and vote for the administration - the Commission.

Hungary became part of this by ratifying a million treaties where it accepts certain conditions and cedes power to the European courts to issue judgement. You know what the primal job of the EU Commission is since its inception? To make sure the member states respected the treaties. And when they didn't the Commission would sue them in front of the European courts.

About 35% of asylum requests are granted in the UK, only about 15% in Germany.

Many countries, including Germany, France, the Netherlands **and Switzerland** (and probably more but these are the ones I know about) use fast-track asylum procedures.

This means that within 48 hours after their hearing people are either admitted or denied and expelled. And do you know another handy trademark of fast-track asylum procedures?

Nearly all of them end in the asylum request being denied. Want some information about Switzerland? Here you go:

That's cute, but do you know the current situation? Spanish and Italian politics already influences you heavily. Not through direct **transparent** election but through diplomatic back room negotiations in the European Council. That's right, not their votes that you can influence have a big effect on you, but their actual leaders. The lovely Berlusconi and the lovely Rajoy directly affect you in the current system.

&gt; A federal state would also mean that we would pay more to other states within the EU- forget 1%. More like 40%

Why? A more transparent and open political system doesn't mean more gets spent.

The difference would be that the public (or whomever) could lobby and fight against any such law in the European Parliament. Right now you do not have that possibility. The big decisions are made in secret negotiations.

Or do you know the exact happenings in the EU budget debate between Merkel, Hollande, Cameron and the others? No you do not. It is not broadcast.

We are currently something like a confederation.

We could become a federation.

That doesn't mean we get a tyrannical central government that decides everything. It merely means it could be truly democratic and truly transparent.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;The lovely Berlusconi and the lovely Rajoy directly affect you in the current system.

The lovely Berlusconi now controls 1 % of my money, not 40-50 % of my money, like you want it. How stupid would I be to agree to that. Basically you seem to want to blackmail me into some sort of federal state, with the argument we are already corrupt and affecting you, so you *have to join*. That is a really, really bad argument, if you don't realise it. Is that truly the best argument you've got?

Also - don't you think we should be able to vote yes or not about it, or are you just going to force soverign states to stop being soverign states? How then ? Otherwise, the Maastricht treaty is not going to be  renegotiated anytome so, so put your dreams on hold. Or, do you mean that it will be renegotiated? When then? 

Also, you never answered what the EU did better than my state, Sweden. I said, some research, I'd like the trade union and stuff like education, but otherwise - what? Finances and economics? Environment - what? 

&gt;Why? A more transparent and open political system doesn't mean more gets spent.

You do not seem to understand what a federal state is. The EU can be more open without being a federal state. However, will not help the corruption in Greece, Italy, Spain etc 

A federal state, what is what you are suggesting is something like Germany or the US. Rather independent states, withing a huge state. And yes, all of them pay something to the lines of between 30-70% of their taxes to the federal government. You are suggesting a federal government, which would mean a EU president, a EU finance minister etc. In short, a United States of Europe. Here, read up on what you are suggesting. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation). Just a quote :

*political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions united by a central (federal) government*

So, you want all of the EU to give up their sovereignity. Good luck with that. I'll fight you until my dying days and I'd much rather my country leave the EU, than not exists anymore, apart from some sort of ""North EU"", where you can extract tax money from. 

&gt;The big decisions are made in secret negotiations.

Exactly. Corrupt fucking EU. You proved my point. 

Also, you did in no way calm my fears that Sweden would be open to more corruption, you didn't give a single argument. How can you guarantee, for the Finns for example, that no more tax money will be spent in corruption, that no more shady deals will be taken, than now, when they are number 1 in the non corruption league.

Donc Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Paul Gauguin, Vincent Van Gogh, Frida Kahlo et les surréalistes, par exemple, sont des représentants de l'art moderne.

- federal system does **not** equal spending more or massively expanding the administration, it just means decisions are democratic and therefore able to be influenced properly by the people
(federal is the opposite of strong central government like France, for example)

You now have three choices:

1. Keep the current system that is relatively fucked up

2. Make the EU democratic and transparent (this is the definition of a federal system because any proper democratic system on a European level would *de facto* be a federal system)

3. Leave the EU

Choose. If you want to avoid any influence of the rest of Europe on your country because you think you're better of without, that's okay, you are able to leave. Trying to convert the EU into purely a big free trade zone is delusional. That will never happen because it is expressively not the goal.

Either you keep the current system, or you make it democratic and open, or you leave. Those are the real choices here.

Quickly answering your points.

&gt;Also, you never answered what the EU did better than my state, Sweden. I said, some research, I'd like the trade union and stuff like education, but otherwise - what? Finances and economics? Environment - what?

- common market
- freedom of mobility, of labour and of residency in all member states
- connected to the previous: thecommon standards in labour market, university systems, consumer protection etc. etc.
- no border controls
- equal treatment before the law in all member states
- EU-wide health care coverage
- EU-compatible retirement system so that your minimum number of years worked is valid in all countries and you get your final pension from a single place
- international political leverage **for example against Swiss tax evasion** with the automatic information exchange system or just any treaty negotiation

There are countless little things. Like SEPA banking that makes debit card usage free in foreign countries and guarantees cheap/free money transfers there as well. Or having the right to open a bank account in other EU countries because you're treated equally to natives.

The main part is economic. You can of course decide to leave the EU like Norway. But then you just have to accept EU legislation anyway, just like Norway. Without having a say in it. You're free to do so, but Norway pays as well. It's no different from being a member, other than having no say in future rules.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;federal system can be democratic and transparent

Can be being the operative word, but it is not like Italy and Spain has managed it. So why would it be different now, when people voting for corrupt politicians, used to corrupt practices are in power. If the Italians and Greeks wanted change, they would have changed before, but they keep voting for idiots, for decades. They have choosen corruption,and they are doing it in every chance they get.  It is hardly going to change just because you give them more influence. They are just going to vote so that Berlusconi and his likes, not only have power over Italy, but over us too. No thanks. 

You do not seem to understand, at all what you are suggesting. A federal system mean, that we give up our sovereignity as states, Sweden will cease to exist, and become the equalent of Sachsen in Germany. 

And, which you continue to ignore, in a federal state- one pay at minimum 30 % of the taxes to the federal government, in this case the government led by the United States of Europe. You can not avoid that.

So, please answer this, because I notice you refuse to. I will not give up, so answer them.

A) Is that what you want. No more states but a United States of Europe? Yes, no 

B)If yes, how are you going to accomplish that? How are you going to get the UK or Sweden to give up their sovereignity? 

C) You keep ignoring the fact that in a federal state a huge chunk is going to federal taxes. Are you saying it will not happen (as in no federal government and taxes), or are you saying it will happen, but all the taxes will be used better than in Sweden and the government will be better than the Swedish one?



&gt;You now have three choices:

AAAAAAH- you are frustrating. I do not only have three choices. 

**Those are the choices that influences 1 % of my countries GDP**. The rest we can decide over ourself, and I am saying we have done a decent job. Some other countries have not.

Yes, we are influenced, to some extent by the law, but certainly not to degree you say. 

Why are you denying that we are a free state? Why do you refuse to admit that? 


&gt;EU-wide health care coverage

Better than the Swedish? 

&gt;There are countless little things

Little being the operative word. Also, everything you mentioned just matter if I want to move, or if I break my leg in Poland. These are unimportant things on a huge scale. I asked, do you think the EU is better at environmental politics than the Swedes? Are the EU better at handling banks crises (No btw)? Better at balancing budget? (No), Better at health care? (no), better at retirement? etc. Big things, that matters, not little, idiotic ones. 



Also, I most certainly missed how the United States of Europe, that you promote, is going to be less corrupt than Sweden. You said it can be done, but refuse to say how. How can you guarantee that?

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"Sometimes I don't know what to think about economic news. One site paints one picture (this article), and yet just yesterday The Economist wrote an article about Italy's manufacturing sector and it paints a very different picture:

[Italian Manufacturing: A Washout](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21583283-years-crisis-have-reinforced-pressure-italys-once-envied-industrial-base-washout)

&gt;Since the financial crisis, two recessions have sent firms reeling. In the first, between 2008 and 2009, manufacturing output fell by 24%. In the second, which began in 2011 and has yet to end, output has so far fallen by almost 10%, more than wiping out the gains of the intervening brief recovery. Production is now 26% below 2007’s peak.
 
&gt;Italy’s makers of luxury clothing and accessories have done fairly well, boosted by strong demand from the emerging world’s new rich. But producers of low-price fabrics and clothes have been badly hit: overall, the textile industry’s output is down by 35%. Production of electrical goods has fallen by a similar proportion, and carmaking is down by 45%. Last year just 397,000 cars rolled off domestic assembly lines at Fiat, Italy’s largest carmaker, against 911,000 in 2007. Its output of vans has recovered a bit since hitting rock bottom in 2009, but at 207,000 last year was 18% below its pre-crisis peak.

...

&gt;The picture is also grim in domestic appliances, another area of manufacturing in which Italy used to be a world leader. The success of firms like Merloni (now renamed Indesit), Candy, Ignis and Zanussi was such that they became the subject of business-school case studies in the 1960s and 1970s.
 
&gt;All the leading appliance-makers were established or made their names between 1945 and 1965, when “white goods”, as they used to be called, epitomised Italy’s post-war economic miracle. Today the production figures paint a picture of an industry under siege. In 2007 Italy turned out 24m appliances. Five years of decline reduced the total to 13m last year: output of washing machines was down by 52% to 4.4m; dishwashers by 59% to 1.1m; fridges by 55% to 1.8m; and cookers by 75% to 300,000.

&gt;The crisis has served to highlight systemic weaknesses in Italy like high labour costs, bureaucracy and poor infrastructure, says Antonio Guerrini, the director-general of CECED Italia, the appliance-makers’ trade body. The only way to survive weak demand and growing competition from giant Chinese appliance firms like Haier is to shift production to lower-cost countries, as Italian makers are now doing. **“Manufacturing mass or entry-level products in Italy is no longer competitive,” says Mr Guerrini. If so, many of the 130,000 remaining jobs in Italian appliance-making are endangered.**

&gt;Slumping output at producers of cars and kitchen gadgets has devastated those who make parts for them. Many have already gone bust. Innocenzo Cipolletta, an economist at Trento University who sits on several company boards including Indesit’s, **worries that the steady loss of links in their supply chains is forcing the big makers of final products to recreate the whole chain abroad, accelerating the hollowing-out of Italian manufacturing.**
 
&gt;Absent a proper resolution of the euro crisis and sweeping economic reforms in Italy (don’t hold your breath on either count) there is not much that can be done in the short term to protect domestic manufacturing. Bigger tax breaks for research, as the appliance-makers are seeking, might help firms move upmarket and sell more abroad. But that would take years, and they do not have that much time. For the foreseeable future Italian manufacturers are stuck trying to sell their existing products to consumers who seem in no rush to replace their old bangers and creaking kitchen gadgets. In a climate of political and economic uncertainty, with rumoured tax rises and certain job losses, Italians are disinclined to spend, and who can blame them for that?

So what is it then? Is Italy's manufacturing sector in deep trouble? Or is it steadily improving? I guess the answer to these questions depepnds on what magazines you read, and what you want the answer to be.",0,1376053361,null,0,false,0,cbk6y2o,t3_1k0pch,t1_cbk6y2o,t3_1k0pch,null,1429890383,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

&gt; However, echoing recent warnings from independent economists, the IMF makes clear that Spain’s growth rates in the years ahead will be too anaemic to allow job creation. The Fund expects Spain’s gross domestic product rise to be less than 1 per cent annually for the next four years, and only 1.2 per cent in 2018.  
“Spain has historically never generated net employment when the economy grew less than 1.5-2 per cent,” the IMF notes. “Yet growth is not projected to reach these rates even in the medium-term. Thus reducing unemployment to its structural level (still likely very high around 18 per cent) by the end of the decade would require a significant improvement in labour market dynamics.”",0,1376053376,null,0,false,0,cbk6y70,t3_1jz9qu,t1_cbk6y70,t1_cbk6bew,null,1429890382,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,QpH,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Finland was seen as a part of Sweden, not something we invaded (perhaps a tad arrgant, but the truth)

Yes, quite true, but erhm. Venta lite. There might be a tad different view about that here in the Österland. While not invaded, we were under foreign rule. And the Swedish did bring Christianity here, which replaced our ancient beliefs.

Lalli is still a great legend amongst us. The peasant who slaughtered a (English?) bishop who came here with the Swedish crusaders to spread Christianity. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, the written history of Finland begins with this event.

The legend of Lalli might certainly be fiction, and the Swedish crusades are disputed amongst some historians. But what's for a fact is that Christianity in Finland gained foot around the same time Sweden took control, no matter how it happened. And Christianity doesn't have a reputation of being kind to pagans.

So one might say some Finns see the whole ordeal as an invasion towards our culture, our way of life. These obviously are modern, post-nationalism era thoughts, as no one knows for sure what our ancestors thought about these things.

If you find someone who is renting out his room for a month or two you will probably pay from 300€ per Month for it. A hostel for a month will probably be slighly more (like 15€ per night). WG-gesucht.de is a good source for sublets in flatshares.

Besides that, Berlin is cheap: You can buy tons of groceries for 10-15€. Otherwise eat fastfood (kebap 3€, pizza 3-5€), at cheap lunch restraurants (around 5€) or get into dumpster diving ;)

Berlin is pretty big (like auckland, but much nicer :P), so you'll probably need a ticket for public transport. that should be around 70€ per month. In a warmer month i would suggest to buy a cheap bike and sell if after. But january in germany can be cold (-5°C) to very cold (-15°C) ...

Another time we entered a shop and the lady there told a clerk to keep an eye on my friend (in german cause I suppose she figured my friend didn't speak german as she 's black). My friend who has a good sense of humor replied back in german, ""don't worry, i'm not a baby and won't break anything in your store.""

My point to you is that even before the ""asylants"" came, some swiss people are a bit careful with the colored people. But indeed, with the wave of immigrants you have now, even my friend says that the swiss police don't even know how to handle these immigrants because even 10 years ago, the crimes that are happening now weren't happening and yes, no sugar coating here, lots of criminal immigrants, unfortunately. And credit to Switzerland for not giving in to the bullshit of the EU about human rights and all that other bullshit they spew. 

Either way, as my friends says, better tighten the laws, otherwise Switzerland will be like Belgium or France for example or some Scandinavian countries! ;) ahahahahaha :D

Translation (by me):

&gt;Currently, apart from allowing expenseless use of certain areas for military purposes, costs for e.g renovations and constructions of new military facilities are financed according to Art. 120 of the German Grundgesetz [=constitution] by the taxpayer funds of the Federal Repbulic of Germany.
&gt;A publication by the federal ministry of finances in 2005 estimated the ""cost of defenses in context with the foreign military presence in Germany"" to about 123.3 million EUR, which are contrasted by 24.9 million EUR of revenue. An exact yearly listing is dificult, since the federal budget offers money through several different institutions.

The only thing that really annoys me is how most of the people I know seem to take this for granted. It's as if they do not make the connection between how awful it was here and still is around the world, and how good we have it - and how fragile it all is.

Plus we're really helpless at best, or malicious at worst in our intent to aid our European partners. 

So while, at the moment, it's really good to be German, I do not know how long this will last and if it's that nice to be in our 'sphere of influence', so to speak.

Please understand that the ""Gibraltar español"" crowd is a vanishingly small and generally ridiculed subset of the far right.

Spaniards are broadly contemptuous of jingoism, having been submitted to an overdose of the same during over four decades.

On the other hand, among the worst defaults of my countrymen is that we *are* as quick to take offence as we are slow to forget our grudges.
