On lui dit ""Vous remplacez les connaissances historiques strictes que l'on a sur une période/un évènement/... par votre vision romancée dans l'idée de bâtir un ""roman national"" qui sert une idéologie très marquée, tout en vous présentant comme historien"". 
Au lieu de dire ""C'est faux, si je parle de tel moment de telle façon, c'est au vu de telle ou telle source"", il part directement dans le registre ""Vous êtes des salauds d'extrême-gauche"" sans passer par la case ""débat scientifique"". C'est là qu'il y a un gros problème.

Et puis je me rappelle que dès ma première année de fac, on nous a averti qu'un certain nombre de mythes, notamment sur l'histoire médiévale, allaient tomber. Au premier rang desquels Poitiers, qui d'après notre prof (qui avait une formule choc, certes) ""n'avait ni eu lieu à Poitiers, ni en 732 et c'était pas des armées qui s'étaient affrontés mais plutôt des éclaireurs un peu paumés et une partie de chasse"". On pourrait évoquer aussi le mythe de Jeanne d'Arc, et quelques autres.
Je suis assez curieux de savoir comment il a pu parler de la Révolution, tiens.

Voilà ce que j'ai capté du truc (précisons que je n'ai pas lu le bouquin, je parle juste de ce que les uns et les autres se reprochent).

Petit edit : je viens de vérifier la bio de Deutsch, et il s'avère qu'il n'a fait aucunes études d'Histoire. Ce qui prouve la valeur des cours de méthodologie qu'on a eu à la fac, et me fait penser que ce monsieur devrait se taire et écouter attentivement l'avis des professionnels.

Germany is a problem for the old powers of the United Kingdom, France, and Russia. You're talking about an old Europe ruled by paranoia and greed in which Germany's very existence disturbs the balance of power. There is plenty of blame to hand to all parties. 

I think you can tell even today by glancing at a map of Europe in 1900 and 2000. The UK, France, and Russia have been satisfied only after cutting Germany down to a fraction of it's former size and potential. There was a lot of external pressure put on the young German state. Kaiser Wilhelm was able to handle it with masterful diplomacy and was certainly one of the greatest leaders Europe has ever seen, but nobody was going to adequately fill his shoes. The leaders that followed were molded by a world that was hostile to the existence of Germany and they were predictdably hostile in return.

Europe 1850-1950 is a prime example of the perils of stubborn nationalism.

true,tachyonburst,null,null,"Here, some highlights from the speech (because i don't like to parrot things) followed by my humble comments… it's a good read though and you wouldn't waste your (or mine) time with it. 

''At its worst point in the 1980s, the median length of unemployment for those looking for a job was 12 weeks, but the median since the Great Recession has averaged 20 weeks and now stands at 16 weeks.''

*What’s the median length in Europe? Shiver the thought, that's what it is.* 

''These are not just statistics to me. We know that long-term unemployment is devastating to workers and their families. Longer spells of unemployment raise the risk of homelessness and have been a factor contributing to the foreclosure crisis. When you're unemployed for six months or a year, it is hard to qualify for a lease, so even the option of relocating to find a job is often off the table. The toll is simply terrible on the mental and physical health of workers, on their marriages, and on their children.''

*The toll is unbearable and we hate to think about, that's how it is.* 

''Long-term unemployment is also a great concern because it has the potential to itself become a headwind restraining the economy. Individuals out of work for an extended period can become less employable as they lose the specific skills acquired in their previous jobs and also lose the habits needed to hold down any job.''

*Darn right it is (headwind that is), they cost money too.., especially in places where knee-jerk austerity initiated cascading failure in which mass layoffs affect employment in completely unrelated and ''unexpected places''… but that's just me… rumbling.* 

''A factor contributing to the high level of long-term unemployment in the current recovery is the relatively large proportion of workers who have permanently lost their previous jobs, as opposed to being laid off temporarily. (…) The greater amount of permanent job loss seen in the recent recession also suggests that there might have been an increase in the degree of mismatch between the skills possessed by the unemployed and those demanded by employers. This possibility and the unprecedented level and persistence of long-term unemployment in this recovery have prompted some to ask whether a significant share of unemployment since the recession is due to structural problems in labor markets and not simply a cyclical shortfall in aggregate demand.''

*Interesting factors, they beg the question, how to heck are we going to plug people back in the grid?*

''I don't mean to suggest that there aren't some workers who have been stranded by structural changes in the economy. More can and should be done to help dislocated workers acquire new skills to transition from industries and occupations with fewer opportunities. But making this transition will be much easier in a healthy economy, which is one reason why I am encouraged by the evidence that elevated unemployment is indeed largely cyclical. I will now describe what the Federal Reserve is doing to try to raise demand and create jobs.''

*Then she goes on about unconventional policies, something that ECB could try too, if it would have a mandate.* 

There, you could have had read that for yourself, but you're a lazy bum that's quick to throw judgments about subject while displaying complete lack of interest in it. ; )

Enfin, et c'est là le plus important, ce déficit structurel (donc pas né d'une mauvaise gestion de fonds comme on pourrait le penser) implique de sérieuses conséquences: fermetures de filières, licenciements, nombre de places limité pour les étudiants qui implique un tirage au sort post bac, ce qui est tout bonnement inadmissible.

This is also how Frisian has shown itself to be an actual different language as it is not part of this dialect continuum. 

Even if they're in a similar situation as Dutch and Low German, for the sake of intelligibility and for practical every day use in different nations, the Scandinavian languages are quite distinct. For linguistic analysis,  there is not a big difference between a dialect and a language anyway. So it's better to refer to it as three languages and get on with our day in this case.

However, it's a bit of an ongoing joke in Ireland that Irish is always longer and more convoluted than English. For example, our road signs have to be widened considerably to include the native Irish names. 

This has more to do with the butchering and Anglicisation of the native Irish script over centuries of British rule. Irish was once a lot more concise than English and had its own script, but the presses and typewriters of the day refused to provide for it.

An example is the word *Connacht*, one of Ireland's provinces, in Irish was originally written as *[cr](http://i.imgur.com/cJJ8ytn.jpg)*, but we have since lost those characters and now Irish unnecessarily bloated.

In all seriousness, real, actual linguists never weigh in on the whole ""language or dialect"" thing, because said questions are actually not scientifically answerable - we don't have any concrete definitions of what constitutes a ""dialect"" or a ""language"" (when we want to be politically neutral, we just go with the generic ""variety""). 

Now's about the time for this well-worn (but appropriately worn!) quote from Max Weinreich: 

&gt; אַ שפּראַך איז אַ דיאַלעקט מיט אַן אַרמיי און פֿלאָט

&gt; ""A language is a dialect with an army and a navy""

""But, but, but,"" you might say, ""what about mutual intelligibility? If two people can understand each other, shouldn't we just consider them to be speaking the same language?""

Well, smart guy, how would you explain situations like Portuguese and Spanish, where Portuguese speakers can often understand Spanish speakers better than the other way around? Or, for extra credit points, how would you describe the varieties of the Inuit languages, where people in Alaska can understand people in the Yukon Territory, and people in the Yukon Territory can understand people in the Northwest Territories, and people in the NW Territories can understand people in Nunavut, and people in Nunavut can understand people in Greenland, but people in Greenland *can't* understand people in Alaska! Where would you draw the lines between language and dialect there, hmm?

So, all these kinds of crazy situations mean the ""language/dialect"" question is pretty much an impossible one to answer scientifically. So linguists don't weigh in on what's a language and what's a dialect, and just go back to studying them to figure out how they work and leave that question up to the political firebrands.

true,Alexander_Von_Stahl,GERM,German-Hungarian living in the US,"Germany is NOT a troublemaker. As someone else mentioned, Germany was a problem for the old powers of Europe, because the German states alone were powerful. United as one nation, Germany had the potential to replace France, Britain, and Russia as the prime power in Europe. The Franco-Prussian war was, in part, due to Germany's actions, but Germany wasn't acting any worse than the other powers of the day. The punishment of Germany (if you could even lay blame on Germany for that war) was completely uncalled for, and you'll notice that it was an American head of state, not a Frenchman, Russian, or a Brit that called for treating Germany fairly. World War 2 was an obvious crescendo that was coming since the signing of an idiotic and skewed ""treaty"" many years ago.

Germany is not a troublemaker. Germany is a nation of many people with many cultures trying to break free of the influence and oppression of other powers, and it has finally done so. Yes, Germany is far from a perfect nation and it has made its own share of mistakes. The price for being a hardworking and organized nation lies in Germany's sometimes crude handling of international politics, but the spirit of the German people is aligned with the spirit of realpolitik.

true,Snarwib,AUST,Australia,"Europe's electricity grid is already pretty integrated. That's the main thing that should be linked as widely as possible. The problem this article describes here isn't actually really much of a problem:

&gt;National solo efforts have their consequences, as demonstrated by the energy transition in Germany, whose nuclear phase-out and simultaneous expansion in eco-electricity are having grave consequences for its neighbours. In peak times, large amounts of green electricity surge through the Dutch, Polish and Czech networks, since the German grid cannot absorb them. Building phase modifiers could prevent that, but only at the cost of putting a de facto end to the internal energy market. Germany cannot really want that, because during winter periods of dim sunshine and weak winds – and high power consumption – the country will have to rely on imported electricity. That power can then come French nuclear plants – which is why the complete nuclear phase-out is just a mirage in any case.

If energy is flowing across borders, it's because it's cheaper than other electricity options in the recipient country at that time (grid). The excess German power is cheaper than anything the Dutch or Polish or Czechs can generate, so those markets shut down their own generation (or export it) and buy the cheaper German power instead. The reverse happens at other times - it's cheaper for Germany to import power at some times than it is for the market there to use its own available domestic generation. If the cross border power wasn't getting bought, it would be unbalanced supply and would be instructed to disconnect from the grid altogether.

That's a market, it's how they work. The same thing happens in Australia between states - some are heavily wind focused, some use coal, some have a lot of hydro.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"Essentially what you quoted was ""please think of the people, give money"" with emotional tone attached to it. And the plea for ECB to use unconventional policies is more or less asking ECB to print money. So lets start from why ECB printing money and why it is problematic and actually the totally wrong, and unfair way to deal with the crisis.

All troubled Eurozone states are more or less medium to high wealth societies. Italy is very wealthy, and so is Ireland, Spain is not far away. Portugal, Greece and Cyprus are all medium wealth economies. Why is this important? It is important because they have capability to actually take care of the welfare of their citizens via means of income transfer between their citizens and thus taking care of the social aspect of the crisis by themselves.

The problem of course in here is that southern troubled economies there is no common will for solidarity: grey economy is big part of the total economy; corruption is rampant in some countries; paying taxes are dodged everywhere and by everybody; etc... Greece for example wouldn't be in this whole mess if everybody had paid their share of taxes. Same too with Italy, Italy could have lowered their total debt burden in the last 10 years when the time was good, but they didn't!

The real problem in here are the leading classes of the troubled societies. They haven't had any interest to fix major problems that they have known that exists for decades, and they still don't have any interest to actually make very hard reforms to combat this problems. And this is both left and right problem!

So what the deal with the EU/ECB/Germany/etc... well to put it straightforwardly that is simply outsourcing the responsibility away. Instead of dealing with problems, leadership in troubled economies is screaming to get others people money to fix the mess that they caused and the mess they are not willing to fix, they just want money to remedy their situation.

Now let me ask you a question. I work hard and I pay my taxes to the Finnish state, so does the company where I work for pay taxes they own, so do all shops and business where I visit pay their taxes. Why should I then be required to also pay for the Spanish-Me, for the Italian-Me, for the Greek-Me, etc... Like I said before, troubled economies are not poor, they have money, what they don't have is people willing to contribute to society. So why exactly should my money flow to those places even if people who are part of those societies don't want to contribute their share? 

And yes, unconventional policies by the ECB, essentially printing money is just that, it is moving purchasing power from one place to another. 

From my point of view as being a person whose money, either in increased taxes or via increased inflation would be transferred from here to there, I just want to ask is that really right? Why should I contribute when others aren't who in the first place should be the ones doing it?

Note that the juridical handling of large tax fraude cases have been repeatedly critiqued in Belgium by the tax inspection and the anti-fraud instances.

The last example is a case of extensive tax fraud by Belgian Prince [Henri de Cröy-Solre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cro%C3%BF). The Belgian State had previously tried to remove the Judge presiding over the case on the ground that she ""was partial to the intrests of the defendant"" and ""raised doubt about her impartiality"".

Chi controlla se hai pagato digita la targa su uno smartphone, a me è accaduto, una volta sola in 10 mesi, che il controllore abbia digitato male la targa e mi abbia fatto la multa, è bastato telefonare per farla annullare.

Il tagliando da esporre si scarica dal sito, ma almeno ad ancona non è obbligatorio, io però dopo la multa errata l'ho esposto.

Ho impostato l'autoricarica sotto la soglia dei due euro, ma non sempre funziona, ricaricare dall'app è comunque molto semplice.

La comodità, oltre ad evitare di cercarsi un parchimetro, è che imposti una sosta stimata, se vai via prima la interrompi e paghi solo il tempo effettivo, se ti devi fermare di più, aggiungi altri minuti man mano che servono.

I don't want to deny that we should probably intervene more, in fact I would say we should finally get rid of the burden of Hitler and WW2, but I can definitely understand that people don't want war and therefore politicians don't want to engage in it aswell, remember Afghanistan was a fiasko politically.

true,mhermans,null,null,"Indeed. I think in this case the procedural issue was that there was a single interview (in a investigation that was started in 1998!) in France with one of the ""frontmen"" used by the Prince that was conducted under oath, which violated his right to remain silent, resulting in the complete dismissal of the case after 15 years.

FYI, this case of fraud involved an estimated 15 fake companies funnelling money, with 43 people involved and an estimated loss of 33m in taxes.

But it does not always ends on a technicality, there is a more interesting route. If you are a CEO of a company that is judged ""important for Belgium"", and found guilty of fraud, you can argue that the damage (for you and the company) of having a criminal record outways the harm that you did. This results in you being ""noted"" als guilty, but without a actual conviction or fine.

For instance the brothers De Nul, directors of the Belgian [De Nul Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_De_Nul), on of the largest dredging companies in the world, were ""noted"" guilty of bribing a tax inspector in 2003. They did not receive a conviction, o.a. due to ""the court took into account his crucial role in managing a specialised dredging business, the main source of employment for many people"".

The same deal was made in 1987 with the head of the family owning the [international textile group Beaulieu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaulieu_International_Group), as ""it could harm his social position and the situation of his employees"". 

His sons were arrested a year later in the UK for fraud, but a 2 million settlement avoided any conviction. When in 1997 the tax inspection had enough of their blatant tax fraud, they charged them with fiscal fraud, forgery of documents and formation of criminal groups. 

This case is still going on, while everybody knows that they are guilty (one of his sons admitted, settled for 50 million and was ostracised from the family). In March this year, they managed to get the government fined for harming them with such a long court case.

Some people would argue that if people like Bush Sr., Thatcher and Gorbatsjov are [coming to your 75th birthday party](http://imgur.com/udK1o7K), you can rest easy that you will not be convicted in Belgium.

Not necessarily, Ukraine is far away from joining EU and till that time a lot of things can change. And we are probably even further away from getting into a Schengen agreement.

Nevertheless, travel can be negotiated, Visa application can be softened to accomodate travel, there is nothing inevitable in this process and a lot can be changed for mutual benefit.

Don't forget that Russia is also negotiating a no-visa travel to the EU.

&gt; But for the Ukraine to join the EU would be in my view unforgivable

1. we are not joining EU. We are signing a Free trade agreement — like we have with the CIS countries; and a Political Association Agreement — Mubarak's Egypt had one.

So, your argument holds true for the military - should we all hand over that?

In fact, when the EU *did* get involved in our energy, they increased the prices for about 7 million Swedes- thank you for that.


And, I have seen what happens when the EU takes over a whole area- like the CAP for example. Not only are Swedes discriminated, the CAP is idioticlly run, it is less effective for us than it was before we entered the EU, our food is not securer, not to mention the fact that I now have to sponsor Greek tobacco and French wine!

true,vlepun,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; The advantage we still have is that in relation to the housing prices, rental prices are pretty low in Belgium.

Well, let's hope it stays that way. Just to illustrate how fucked up the housing market in The Netherlands still is, here's my situation:

As a starting couple we're forced to rent. Not because we want to, but because all the houses that are actually future-proof are just way too expensive. Yes, our prices have dropped, but because a lot of people are now left behind with more mortgage than their house is worth on today's market, they're not selling.

As a result, we're renting. Because we make too much money for social renting (just €100,- per month above the limit) we're forced to rent from private companies. This means that for a maisonette of 110m² we're paying as much in rent as my parents are paying on their mortgage, energy bill and maintenance costs combined. And they live in a fully detached villa. In an area that's way more attractive than where we live. 

I mean, that's just insane and the really fucked up part is that I'm not the only one who has to live like this. A majority of young people that are fresh out of college/university and are just starting are making too little to be able to buy, but too much to be able to rent socially. They are therefore forced to either live at home with mom and dad, stay in their college rooms or rent from a private company. In my opinion that's not a healthy situation in the long term.

true,tachyonburst,null,null,"&gt; Essentially what you quoted was ""please think of the people, give money"" with emotional tone attached to it. And the plea for ECB to use unconventional policies is more or less asking ECB to print money. So lets start from why ECB printing money and why it is problematic and actually the totally wrong, and unfair way to deal with the crisis.

As you can see, whole post you're replaying to is about ''unprecedented nature'' of unemployment in Great Recession. You can read it again and you'll notice that your reply has little or nothing to do with the subject. What you wrote, on the other hand, is conditioned and often parroted thought.  

Picture about our economic reality changes when you zoom out from specific place and/or shift angles. When you take some time to explore hot-spots around the interconnected globe it comes to mind that the role of Central banks changed significantly. 

For example, FED is not merely kick-starting economy, it has mandate of preserving social order in environment heavily influenced by Second amendment. If it's not obvious now, this crucial new role will become more apparent as time flies by, in system that's essentially broken and reliant on imagination. 

Simplifying all this with such sound bites as ''please think of the people, give money'' isn't just silly, but dangerous, imo, as always.     

&gt; All troubled Eurozone states are more or less medium to high wealth societies. Italy is very wealthy, and so is Ireland, Spain is not far away. Portugal, Greece and Cyprus are all medium wealth economies. Why is this important? It is important because they have capability to actually take care of the welfare of their citizens via means of income transfer between their citizens and thus taking care of the social aspect of the crisis by themselves.

So now you're advocating wealth redistribution? That's fine with me... How should we pull it? Russell Brand or unconventional policy style? 

&gt; The problem of course in here is that southern troubled economies there is no common will for solidarity: 

Now that's just malarkey. 

&gt; The real problem in here are the leading classes of the troubled societies. They haven't had any interest to fix major problems that they have known that exists for decades, and they still don't have any interest to actually make very hard reforms to combat this problems. And this is both left and right problem! So what the deal with the EU/ECB/Germany/etc... well to put it straightforwardly that is simply outsourcing the responsibility away. Instead of dealing with problems, leadership in troubled economies is screaming to get others people money to fix the mess that they caused and the mess they are not willing to fix, they just want money to remedy their situation.

Where is this Finland? On one of Jupiter moons? People around Europe are reforming themselves into oblivion. It's in the news… all the time.  

&gt; Now let me ask you a question. I work hard and I pay my taxes to the Finnish state, so does the company where I work for pay taxes they own, so do all shops and business where I visit pay their taxes. Why should I then be required to also pay for the Spanish-Me, for the Italian-Me, for the Greek-Me, etc... Like I said before, troubled economies are not poor, they have money, what they don't have is people willing to contribute to society. So why exactly should my money flow to those places even if people who are part of those societies don't want to contribute their share?
And yes, unconventional policies by the ECB, essentially printing money is just that, it is moving purchasing power from one place to another.

Again, do focus on the subject. If you do, you'll be able to say that people are willing but unable to contribute to society because such is the nature of unemployment in Great Recession. I'm arguing that we won't be able to fix it, if we don't target it. Any thoughts about the subject?   

&gt; From my point of view as being a person whose money, either in increased taxes or via increased inflation would be transferred from here to there, I just want to ask is that really right? Why should I contribute when others aren't who in the first place should be the ones doing it?

Because the problems unsolved will come knocking on (y)our door. Can't you hear them knocking? Knock-knock-knock... 

&gt; M.Sc.Econ and the last 10 years in business life, I know what talking and what the subject is, and it is interesting, but the general problem with people in reddit and in general is that they don't know, and they don't want to know better.

&gt;Is it realistic to call a Semite antisemite if an Arab doesn't like Jews? 

Yes. Words can have different meanings then their etymologies. For example if I ask you ""Understand?"" I am not actually asking if you are standing under something :)

Claiming that a word is exactly its etymology (like many who say ""Israel is antisemitic because Palestinians are Semites"") are using what is known as an [etymological fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymological_fallacy)

Also, you should take note that while the use of ""Semitic languages"" is still used, the idea of ""Semitic peoples"" is a bit outdated, being from the same period as the idea of ""Aryan poples"" and other pseudo scientific racial theories.

true,Herra_X,null,null,"&gt;Having a child is a life changing situation. A child needs your full attention no matter what. In that regard, maintaing a job would be counterintuitive. Being a parent is a full time job, not something you do on the side.

Funny how women can go to work and still have children who grow to be upstanding citizens without traumas.

&gt;Why have a child if you have no interest in raising it?

Well, let's see. Condom might have broken and the mother didn't want abortion. Or the child might have come out from an one night stand. Husband might have a job that involves long days or a lot of business trips. Husband (or wife, for that matter) may die. 

Then there are the less popular reasons; want of heir, cultural expectations and/or pressure, contraceptives are against the word of God etc. 

&gt;How is advocating that parents should focus entirely on the needs of the child as opposed to their own ""traditional""?

I'd say that was there ever a time outside a brief moment in the 50s when a woman could take care of only children? When preparing food, keeping the house clean etc. was a fulltime job, the kids just ran around. Since then we have gotten dishwashers, clothes-washing machines, hoovers, microwaves etc. which has cut the amount of time needed for the work to fraction. 

But I didn't answer your question; I'd say it's ""traditional"" in the sense that people think that woman's place in marriage is at home raising children, not taking into account that ""at home"" used to mean a lot more than just ""raising children"". 

And the children were raised when they could start doing jobs - at the age of five or seven at latest. Then they would have followed the men to look after the sheep or whatever.

&gt;So what? Should the low birthrates of developed nations be such a huge concern for us when there are other, more pressing issues at hand?

I'd say that the shape of population pyramid is always a pressing issue.

&gt;A Telegraph article is hardly evidence of anything. Japan's issues are complex and there isn't one single reason people can blame for them.

It's a Guardian-article. 

And there are studies done; how about Anneli Anttonen's book *Suomalaista sosiaalipolitiikkaa*, which refers to Jens Alber's *Der deutsche sozialstaat im licht international vergleichender daten* study which discusses how the houswife-centric view of women lead to low birth numbers in Germany?

&gt;If it worked well enough we'd have no need for kindergardens.

Well obviously kindergartens are superior for longterm.

&gt;They're human beings whose future depends entirely on you.

The future depends on the society in which they are raised, not to the parent(s) singularly.

Die niedrigen Lohnstückkosten in Deutschland haben die Krise in den o.g. Ländern noch weiter befeuert. Abgesehn davon haben die Länder nicht einmal was miteinander zu tun. Jedes einzelne Land hat ihre eigenen Fehler begangen (siehe unten). In Spanien war es z.B. u.a. ein künstlich herbeigeführter Immobillienboom der explodiert ist. Das hat absolut gar nichts mit Italien oder Frankreich zu tun. 

Jetzt zu sagen ""Wenn Deutschland so wäre wie X"" zeugt einfach nur von einem grundlegenden Unverständnis der Situation gegenüber.

&gt; Die Exportorientierung ist nichts neues und existiert seit mindestens 40 Jahren. 

Es geht, wie ich schon sagte nicht um eine ""Exportorientierung"" sondern um die drastische Senkung von Lohnstückkosten welche dazu geführt hat, dass Deutschland im Euroland ein Billiglohnland wurde.

Outcomes for children raised by single parents are worse when compared to the outcomes for children raised by a family. 

&gt;Well, let's see. Condom might have broken and the mother didn't want abortion. Or the child might have come out from an one night stand. Husband might have a job that involves long days or a lot of business trips. Husband (or wife, for that matter) may die.
Then there are the less popular reasons; want of heir, cultural expectations and/or pressure, contraceptives are against the word of God etc. 

I was referring to couples that have kids only to later renege their parental responsibilities. 

&gt;But I didn't answer your question; I'd say it's ""traditional"" in the sense that people think that woman's place in marriage is at home raising children, not taking into account that ""at home"" used to mean a lot more than just ""raising children"". 

I have never claimed that a woman's place is at home. In fact, I've made it perfectly clear that it doesn't matter which parent takes on the responsibilities of child rearing as long as one of them does. 

&gt;It's a Guardian-article. 

That's even worse.

Birth rates have lowered in every single developed economy on this planet. What you refer to hardly explains it.

For example the time spent learning Swedish in Lappeenranta (right next to Russian border, full of Russian tourists.

That is a language they would benefit from in everyday life, it would help their careers, especially in tourism or retail.

Also you must concider that a person can only learn a finite amount of languages and I think it would benefit all of us to be in charge which ones we'd like to learn. Most Finnish speaking Finns I've met can't even have a short conversation in Swedish after years of studying so it often goes to waste if the learner isn't motivated. This can be somewhat improved by allowing people to choose a language they *want* to learn.

They tend to be from less educated and functional families, which affects the kids as well. 

&gt;I was referring to couples that have kids only to later renege their parental responsibilities.

My list had such examples as well. My point is that even if a child is planned, you can't make a plan for the next 20 years without something going wrong. Sometimes this ""something"" is death, sometimes the choice between financial security of the family vs. being present. 

&gt;In fact, I've made it perfectly clear that it doesn't matter which parent takes on the responsibilities of child rearing as long as one of them does.

Very well, I apologise on this point. 

&gt;Birth rates have lowered in every single developed economy on this planet. What you refer to hardly explains it.

In Nordic system where both parents are seen to belong to work-life and the children are seen as partly the responsibility of the state, the birthrates are for 2010 as follows: Denmark 1,87; Finland 1,87; Norway 1,97 and Sweden 1,98. 

Germany is 1,39. 

Countries with higher birthrates than North are Ireland (2,07: I'd say due to Catholicism), France (2,03: [excellent services for new mothers](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/52654.php)), Iceland ([apparently highest amount of women working outside home](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/18/iceland)), UK ([migration](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23618487)). That's it. 

I'd say that's a trend.

&gt;Could you clarify? (Kindergartens)

Well, you need less people to take care of the kids. But obviously this causes certain limitations, so they can't be solution for every particular crisis.

- The National Anthem was written in Strasbourg, but got its name after a battalion from Marseille sang it whilst marching through Paris. Its original name was *L'hymn de l'armée du rhin*

- Britain does not own the Channel Islands, the Channel Islands owns Britain. This date back to when the island were Norman and William Duke of Normandy invaded Britain in 1066. Edit: Before anyone says something. I know they are properties of the crown.

- Speaking of Normandy. The Cotentin peninsula is one of my favourite places. I hate the fact I have developed an allergy to Mussels. Best restaurant I ever ate in was at the harbour in Diellette. You had two choices: Mussels and Fries, or Steak and Fries.

- Whilst talking about food, dishes such as *Ratatouille*, *Boeuf Bourignon* and other regional stews are often peasent dishes. I find this interesting, because the British equivalents such as Lancashire Hotpot don't carry the same finesse.

- If people want to make a good impression with my step-mum, they give her a bottle of Alsatian Riesling. Stuff is incredible.

- Norman cider is the best cider I've ever had. Especially the stuff you buy straight from the farmer at the side of the road.

- Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport is both a marvel and a hell-hole. Sometimes I think it is amazingly designed, other times the worst place on earth.

- Some kids dicking about found some of the oldest cave paintings in the world.

- The University of Strasbourg is the largest university in France (but only because they amalgamated Strasbourg I, II and III in 2010 into one).

- Arsene Wenger studied in Strasbourg and is from Colmar (where the bloke who built the Statue of Liberty is from. Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi). He grew up in a German speaking house.

- France has sparse natural resources so has a lot of nuclear power.

- Mi sono rimpatriata ed ora mi trovo sempre a New York. Sto per andarmene di nuovo pero' stavolta nei Paesi Bassi.

- Ho prima scelto Catania per la sua universita' che purtroppo, secondo me era pessima. Quest'e' il problema nel fare un confronto fra la mia universita' americana (che avevo appena lasciata per trasferirmi in Italia) ed un'universita' siciliana. Ho anche scelto Catania perche' essendo di origini siciliane (ma non catanesi), volevo provare a viverci. La Sicilia e' bella ma... caotica. Poi mi sono trasferita a Reggio Emilia per lavoro, e mi sono immatricolata presso l'universita' di Bologna che mi e' piaciuta di piu' pero' era ancora molto peggio rispetto alla mia vecchia universita' americana. Alla fine pero' non ho potuto laurearmi in Italia e ho dovuto tornare negli States perche' il mio cugino era malato di cancro e la nonna stave per morire, e non volevo trovarmi oltreoceano mentre si stavano per morire tutti e due. :(

- No, anzi. Mi hanno sempre chiesto ""ma vieni da NEW YORK?! Perche' sei in Italia!??"" come se fossero in me non avrebbero mai lasciato la Grande Mela. Curiosita': in Sicilia tutti mi dicevano ""ma conosci il mio cugino? Mio zio? Sisi, abita proprio a Brucculinu, unn'e' possibbili ca un u canusci!"" Haha... mitici! Tutti gli italiani che ho conosciuto sono stati proprio gentilissimi con me e mi hanno accolta a braccia aperte. :) 

- Dipende da quanto vuoi lavorare per far si' che i tuoi sogni diventino realta'. Io per esempio ho sempre avuto il sogno di lavorare in proprio, poter pagarmi l'affitto da sola, ecc. e un giorno lavorare come traduttrice per le nazioni unite oppure la unione europea. Adesso a 24 anni, lavoro in proprio facendo traduzioni e servizi di interpretariato (italiano, spagnolo, francese e siciliano [a volte!] &gt; inglese). Guadagno dai 1.000 ai 6.000+ euro al mese e fra qualche anno saro' certificata ad eserguire i servizi di conference interpreting come volevo da piccola. Ho lavorato tanto con tanta grinta e ci ho messo tutto il cuore ma adesso che ne vedo i risultati son proprio contenta. :)",0,1383922299,null,0,1383922541,0,cd9nhti,t3_1q6dx2,t1_cd9nhti,t1_cd9n8fd,null,1428741794,12,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,12
true,TheMania,null,null,"I don't understand where your coming from, foreign aid is an option regardless of whether you share a currency or not. It's neither here nor there w/ regard to the Euro. Again though, paying for your exports with aid from other nations isn't exactly a sustainable policy - but it does work as long as they're willing to provide it. That applies whether you're sharing a currency or not.

And you're missing the biggest difference about having your own currency and using one out of your control.

If you're running a trade deficit, your nation is being drained of whatever currency its using. If that's Euros, you need to acquire a source of Euros from outside your nation to fund it, lest you'll end up with unemployment (shortage of spending). That's Greece/Spain/Portugal/etc. These countries are left borrowing Euros to fund their trade deficits, as the alternative - austerity (having both the public and foreign sectors squeeze money simultaneously) would mean unemployment.. as we see today.

If however you have your own currency, say Japan/USA, trade deficits are not such a problem at all. You still have to borrow the currency back, but in this case you're borrowing a currency under your control. A currency that your own central bank sets the risk-free rate of. And, as the currency-issuer, you're assured that risk-free rate. As in, low interest rates irrespective of your level of debt - just look at Japan/USA/UK/Canada/etc for an example of that.

Meanwhile compare Greece. If you have Euros to invest, there's all manner of places that you might sooner loan to than the Greek government. If you have yen to invest though, where can be safer than the Japanese government? USD, the US government? A quick look at bond yields will tell you that investors agree, there's no safer place that you can invest a government's currency than with the entity that issues it.

And that's the key difference. If Japan were to start running a trade deficit a'la the US, they can simply fill the gap in demand with even larger public sector deficits. If Greece runs a trade deficit, they may not be able to. They may be left in a position where the country has run out of the very currency it uses, and people are left unemployed due to a shortage of spending of that currency. Due to taxes being too high for the government's overall level of expenditure. It's a problem inherent in fixed exchange and shared currency regimes that simply cannot be overcome without fiscal transfers between states. It's why the Euro is inherently flawed. It has no measures to solve the problem of a nation running out of it.. ultimately, it encourages mercantilist policies (to try and prevent trade deficits) just like the gold standard before it. Running it simultaneously with free trade, as the EMU is, merely results in a quicker collapse. Those countries with the strongest export sectors (Germany) will merely end up succeeding whilst their partners collapse around them, for shortage of ""money"".

Now the solution under the gold standard, much of Earths history, was to discover new sources of gold and/or declare war when your nation ran out. We're yet to see what the solution to the Euro problem will be, but I'm hoping it's countries just going back to redefining money to something within their individual control. Having it foreign, out of everyone's control, does no one any favours.",0,1383922305,null,0,false,0,cd9nhw4,t3_1pv83q,t1_cd9nhw4,t1_cd9laim,null,1428741793,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,timoleon,FRNK,Franken,"&gt;Jetzt zu sagen ""Wenn Deutschland so wäre wie X"" zeugt einfach nur von einem grundlegenden Unverständnis der Situation gegenüber.

&gt;Es geht, wie ich schon sagte nicht um eine ""Exportorientierung""

Das (absichtliche?) Unverständnis liegt zur Rolle des Exports eher bei dir, wie die [Handelsbilanzen der genannten Länder zeigen.](http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/252105/umfrage/handelsbilanz-der-eu-laender/) 

Und [die Lohnstückkosten in der EU](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=de&amp;pcode=tipslm20) bis um Beginn der Krise 2007/8 widersprechen deiner Behauptung ebenfalls. Bis dahin waren sie nämlich mit den deutschen vergleichbar.

Was die Länder gemeinsam haben war die übermäßige Kreditaufnahme durch öffentliche und/oder private Schuldner, sei es zum Zweck von Immobilienspekulationen wie in Irland und Spanien, oder der politisch gewollten Alimentierung von Interessengruppen wie in Griechenland.  Ermöglicht durch einen einheitlichen Kreditzins in der Eurozone, der länderspezifische Risiken viel zu lange ignorierte.

Betreffend Milton Friedman: mit welchen Vorwänden willst du dann Paul Krugman abtun? 

Bzw. seine zahlreichen Kollegen wie u.a. [Martin Feldstein](http://www.weeklystandard.com/print/articles/predictable-crisis), oder die hier genannten:

&gt;here’s Stephanie Bell, writing as long ago as 2002, who warned that “the prospects for stabilization in the euro zone appear grim.”

&gt;And the year before that, back in 2001, Warren Mosler wrote that history and logic dictate that the credit sensitive euro-12 national governments and banking system will be tested.

&gt;“The market’s arrows will inflict an initially narrow liquidity crisis, which will immediately infect and rapidly arrest the entire euro payments system,” he said. “Only the inevitable, currently prohibited, direct intervention of the ECB will be capable of performing the resurrection, and from the ashes of that fallen flaming star an immortal sovereign currency will no doubt emerge.”

&gt;But two years before that Mathew Forstater was highlighting the problem that “market forces can demand pro-cyclical fiscal policy during a recession, compounding recessionary influences.”

&gt;Even earlier, in 1998, L. Randall Wray was concerned that the euro zone would be much like a U.S. operating with a Fed, but with only individual state treasuries. It will be as if each member country were to attempt to operate fiscal policy in a foreign currency; deficit spending will require borrowing in that foreign currency according to the dictates of private markets, he said.

&gt;And the winner? According to the Levy Institute, that was Wynne Godley, as far back as 1997, who wrote:

&gt;“The danger… is that the budgetary restraint to which governments are individually committed will impart a disinflationary bias that locks Europe as a whole into a depression it is powerless to lift.”

Ja. Es ist vermutlich noch viel gruseliger. Die meisten solcher Algorithmen funktionieren über Machine Learning. D.h. man füttert den Klassifikator mit bekannten Fällen anhand derer er lernt neue Fälle zu beurteilen. Das funktioniert für viele Bereiche wirklich sehr gut - das Problem bei Terroristen ist nur, dass es recht wenige Daten zum Lernen gibt. [Hier ist ein Paper was solche and andere typische Probleme erklärt](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~george/ay122/cacm12.pdf) - Ich bin da leider auch kein Fachmann aber prinzipell gilt, dass mehr Daten besser sind. Gibt es nicht genug Daten ist die Fehlerrate entsprechend höher. 

Das ist soweit ich das überblicke und im Studium mitbekomme ein nicht wirklich gelöstes Problem bzw. kommt es eben darauf an was für ""Features"" die Verbrechererkennersoftware so hat und mit welchen Daten sie gefüttert wurde. Da können viele unvorhergesehen Dinge passieren. Kann auch sein, dass man das mittlerweile im Griff hat - ich weiß es nicht. 

Jedenfalls sollte jedem klar sein, dass hier nicht ein unfehlbarer Computer am Werk ist sondern nur ein statistisches Modell abgerattert wird - dass von dem Betrieber beliebig manipuliert werden kann und garantiert Bugs und Nebenwirkungen hat.

- giochiamo in un bosco nei dintorni di meda (MB), non abbiamo scenari urbani. Per il nostro campo abbiamo tutte le autorizzazioni necessarie (carabinieri, questura, comune, proprietari).

- Non emuliamo alcun corpo di eserciti, ma abbiamo un setup di squadra. Divisa con pattern MARPAT, gilet tattico Mar-Om Dolphin TV7711 (o 7710), boonie hat MARPAT, guanti, ginocchiere, gomitiere. Da regolamento di squadra dobbiamo anche possedere una replica con caricatore tipo Colt/stanag (l'M16, l'M4, il TAR21, per fare tre esempi). Gli occhialini devono essere certificati antischeggia e i guanti sono caldamente consigliati.

- di solito giochiamo a catch the flag, ma con una bandiera sola. Attacco contro difesa, rapporto 2:1. La difesa si posiziona e quando è pronta da il via. Da quando l'attacco controfischia, il gioco comincia. Timer settato su 30 minuti, l'attacco deve conquistare la bandiera e tenerla per 60 secondi, anche senza aver eliminato la difesa. La difesa deve eliminare l'attacco o far scadere il tempo.

- qui è una questione di quanto vuoi spendere. Puoi partire da 150€ se prendi proprio cinesaglie inguardabili. Se vuoi cose di qualità, performanti e durevoli, puoi spendere parecchio. Io che ho 2 asg, una mimetica estiva, una invernale e un po' di accessori, in tutto avrò speso...boh, forse 2000 sacchi in 5 anni. Poi occasionalmente esce magari l'accessorio figo, o la replica che attendevi da anni, e qualcosina ce lo spendi. Ma il grosso si spende all'inizio, il resto è manutenzione, ricambi e gingilli.

- No. ***EDIT***: però un mio compagno di squadra, per sfiga, ha preso un pallino nell'occhio e solo per culo non gli si è distaccata la retina.

- Cacciatori che cacciavano in zona ove vige il divieto alla pratica venatoria, che hanno da dire e ci sparano da lontano (fortunatamente nessuno è stato colpito, ma i carabinieri non sono arrivati in tempo).

- Mai. MAI. Quello lo fanno i quindicenni e i babymafiosi. Io le mie repliche le porto fino al campo con tappo rosso (e non solo puntale), senza caricatore e senza batteria, chiuse in una borsa nel baule. Prendo lo sport sul serio, e detesto quando vedo sbarbatelli arrivare ai parcheggi e sventolare il loro AK47 senza volata rossa sboroneggiandosi con gli amici. Piccolo aneddoto: una volta, al nostro vecchio ritrovo (un autogrill appena fuori l'autostrada), eravamo in attesa degli ultimi quando arriva un'altra squadra, tutti sui 17-20 anni (la nostra età media è 35 anni...). Tutti in mimetica completa -e anche qui, mai girare in completo, ma sempre in spezzato- e baldanzosi. A un certo punto arriva sgommando una macchina, si piazza in mezzo al parcheggio, scende questo quarantenne in mimetica, passamontagna e due M4 in mano, urlando ""VI AMMAZZO TUUUUTTTTIIIIII"". Era il loro ""presidente"". Ci siamo avvicinati, gli abbiamo parlato prima con le buone, poi al suo ""cazzosietevoi, cazzovoletevoi"" abbiamo chiamato i carabinieri.

Social services provide guidance, counseling and offer support during times of need.

&gt; Und die Lohnstückkosten in der EU bis um Beginn der Krise 2007/8 widersprechen deiner Behauptung ebenfalls. Bis dahin waren sie nämlich mit den deutschen vergleichbar.

Ich sagte: 

&gt; Die niedrigen Lohnstückkosten in Deutschland **haben die Krise** in den o.g. Ländern noch weiter **befeuert**.

Es sind wie gesagt viele verschiedene ""Strategien"" die die Probleme in den obigen Ländern erzeugt haben. Deutschlands Strategie mit Gewinn aus der Krise zu kommen und diese gleichzeitig zu befeuern war u.a. ein Stillstand bei der Lohnentwicklung (siehe mein Vorschlag im ersten Kommentar) und Steigerung der Produktivität (=Lohnstückkosten). 

&gt; Was die Länder gemeinsam haben war die übermäßige Kreditaufnahme durch öffentliche und/oder private Schuldner, sei es zum Zweck von Immobilienspekulationen wie in Irland und Spanien, oder der politisch gewollten Alimentierung von Interessengruppen wie in Griechenland. Ermöglicht durch einen einheitlichen Kreditzins in der Eurozone, der länderspezifische Risiken viel zu lange ignorierte.

Genau diese Interessengruppen hast oben mit Friedman noch verteidigt (bzw. warum auch immer zu Wahrsagern hochglorifiziert). Wie ich oben bereits geschrieben habe: 

&gt; Der Zusammenbruch der Südländer ist doch ebenfalls die Frucht dessen was der Mann gelehrt hat. Es ist eine reinterpretation der Nummer die seine Leute schon in Südamerika abgezogen haben (google: Chicago Boys z.B.). Ausgeführt von neoliberalen Grosskapitalisten die Länder wie Griechenland oder Spanien direkt ""beraten"" haben und heute von den Resultaten dieser ""Beratungen"" profitieren indem sie nun Staatseigentum zu Ramschpreisen einkaufen. Auch bekannt als ""Schock Doktin"".

Ich weiss irgendwie nicht so wirklich worauf du hinaus willst. 

&gt; Betreffend Milton Friedman: mit welchen Vorwänden willst du dann Paul Krugman abtun? 

Du hast meine ""Vorwände"" noch gar nicht entkräftigt. Du deklarierst sie jetzt einfach als solche im gleichen Satz in dem du den nächsten Versuch(?) startest. 

Wie bereits gesagt: die neoliberale Ideologie von Friedman &amp; Co. wurden hier von den Regierungen über die EU durchgesetzt. Was früher nicht einfach so möglich gewesen wäre. Weswegen ich eine weitere Liberalisierung des Dienstleistungssektors nicht für sinnvoll halte weil das ebenfalls aus dieser Ideologie erwächst (siehe ebenfalls meinen ersten Kommentar). 

Hätte die Regierung zum Anfang der Krise in Infrastrukturprojekte investiert und nicht den Lohnstillstand geduldet (und die neoliberalen Zocker gerettet), würde die Handelsbilanz gesünder aussehen, wir hätten mehr Geld in den Taschen, die Nachbarländer hätten die Chance auf höhere Exporte und der ganze Euroraum hätte eine Chance in eine Balance zu kommen (ebenfalls erster Kommentar). Das war hier aber anscheinend nie Sinn der Sache. Statt dessen hat man sich angeschaut wie man am schnellsten wertvolle Schätze plündert und den meisten Gewinn einfährt.

true,RedditCanBeAScumbag,ANAR,HAVE A NICE DAY!,"Could I cross-post a comment about the National Front in this thread?

EDIT (HERE IS THE COMMENT):
Let me start with law and order, move through immigration, foreign policy, social policy, globalization, nationalism, and end with trade and economics. ""The Extreme Right in France: From Pétain to Le Pen"" by J.G. Shields covers a bit of the National Front, as well as some other right-wing politics of France.

The stance on the prison system is right-wing, believing in retribution style prisons instead of rehabilitation, as well as implementing a stance of zero-tolerance on crime (one strike and you're out), as well as wanting to move to reintroduce the death penalty after it was abolished in 1981 by law (now being in the French constitution and part of a number of human rights treaties).

Immigration wasn't originally an issue with the National Party, some reducing, but that's per norm with most European right wing parties. When Jean-Pierre Stirbois came to the forefront of far-right politics in France he brought with him the idea of solidarism, which, while originally presented as an opposition to both Soviet and U.S. influences now seems to be focused chiefly on excluding all ""non-French"". The use of the phrasing of what secularization means tends to also be a part of what the National Front use in their stance against immigration, as they say that if there are Muslims in the country, secularization may be threatened. Also the party ties a supposed breakdown in law and order to immigration, including the phrase ""mortal threat to civil peace in France"" being used. Marine Le Pen has also explicitly criticized Muslim people.

Foreign policy is a tough one, as the NF has switched views a couple of times (favouring the EU to disagreeing with the formation, and in 2004 likening it to the New World Order), though Marine Le Pen has currently been against dual citizenship, championed leaving the Euro, but has flipped her father's view of Holocaust denial to being a heavy (outward) supporter of Israel. The NF has also rejected Turkey being allowed into the EU. They have also been heavily French nationalist and souverainisme supportive, as well as being heavily Eurosceptic and rejecting the idea of globalization for numerous reasons (including immigration).

The social stances of the party have been quite socially conservative, including forcing homosexual party members to hide their homosexuality while officially standing against same-sex marriage. I'd get into the social conservatism, but a lot of it is immigration related.

Trade and economics are relatively far-right, though outwardly seeming to be mildly socialist. The protectionist view, while originally a socialist stance, is used by the NF to reaffirm their stance on anti-immigration, as well as Le Pen's view of government involvement in healthcare/education/transportation/etc. looking socialist in nature, the reasoning tends to be, again, both anti-globalization and anti-immigrant. The economics of taxes are fairly right wing as well, hoping for a drop in taxes and ""welfare abusers"" though keeping with the protectionism in the ideas of state-run organisations. The has also said they wish for the bureaucratic system to be be slimmed tremendously, if not cut entirely. I will admit the idea of the laissez faire is a different one in years past, but it seems to be a laissez faire at its core, with Le Pen criticizing who should be considered poor (believing that too many are considered in poverty).

I personally see immigration and a growing confederation of Europe a necessity in the emerging global economy. Europe (including France) doesn't have an international trading, banking, research, or technological economy yet, and sticking to the old way of relying on a manpower focused industrial economy. They will not be able to compete the more and more modernized India, China, and some other large population countries become. Maybe in the future France can survive on its own, but without a push into technological advancement of economics, I don't see anything but recession hitting France.

As for my moral qualms with the NF view of immigration, I have a number, but I won't get into them, as that's fairly subjective.

I have plenty of reasons to disagree with the prison and law system the NF wants. Allow me to quote another comment I had from about a week ago:

""Yes, but a maximum security prison are often for those who are often receiving sentence over fifteen years, if not over twenty (this is with parole, as class A and B felonies are twenty-five years or more, life, or death, and rarely have parole). Usually these sentences are for your more serious crimes, and usually crimes where the harm was either premeditated or heinous in action. I don't think anyone is arguing that there are people who do these actions where rehabilitation is often less effective, or ineffective, but that isn't what we're discussing here. We're most likely discussing cases in which the prisoners are in Class B-D prisons and have high probability to at least have the ability to be rehabilitated. In the U.S., U.K., Russia, and a number of other countries you'll see that when retribution is used, there are high populations of younger peoples in prisons (often 16-18, for career criminals for first incarceration), where they will be set back from graduation from a secondary education system. This leads to a necessity for these former convicts to find a job to pay bills when released, and because of where they were sent they make connections with other prisoners instead of finishing their education, leading to a life of career crime. Often these countries have huge stigmas about formerly incarcerated individuals (you can even see this on Reddit, in which many Redditors hold stigmas against former inmates). In the U.S. on many job applications you will see a box to indicate whether or not you were charged with a crime, and many people will be turned down if they were incarcerated, simply because they were incarcerated. There is almost a cultural belief that many people don't deserve forgiveness, for some reason or another. This has larger implications than just for former inmates, but that's another conversation altogether. Suffice to say that our argument isn't nearly so much with Class A or B felonies, but rather the fact that many with misdemeanors or felonies C-E are often not rehabilitated, and are often but in retribution prisons which don't offer many, or any, forseeable positives.""",0,1383927234,null,0,1383927828,0,cd9pbrw,t3_1q650l,t1_cd9pbrw,t3_1q650l,null,1428740939,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3

true,[deleted],null,null,"While a majority of Scots consider themselves Scottish rather than British, surprisingly few have any confidence in the ability for Scotland to succeed as an independent country. 

In my opinion, this explains a lot of the actions of both the yes campaign and the unionists. The unionists are fully aware that Scotland as a whole is somewhat ambivalent about the UK, and feels somewhat neglected by Westminster, but are also aware that the Scots are somewhat apprehensive about independence, so instead of actually trying to drum up support for their campaign focus on scare tactics to turn people away from the yes campaign. As such a lot of the focus is on uncertainty - in wealth, services and politics.

The yes campaign on the other hand is making lots of half-hearted suggestions, as they know that the people who they need to attract aren't the die hard independence voters, but the 'middle ground' of concerned voters, who aren't actually against the idea of remaining in Britain, even if they aren't necessarily in full support of it either. While many SNP voters might be disappointed to hear the suggestion that we would keep the queen or the pound, it isn't going to put them off voting for independence, so the yes campaign has to focus on those who could be scared off quite easily, even if those who fully support an independent Scotland don't think these suggestions are truly feasible in the long term.

In short, the unionists are trying to stop people voting for independence rather than convincing them to vote against it while the yes campaign are almost trying to give a watered down version of it to make it more palatable for those who are on the fence.

&gt; NY Times, Januar 12, 2011

&gt;The tragedy of the Euromess is that the creation of the euro was supposed to be the
finest moment in a grand and noble undertaking: the generations-long effort to bring
peace, democracy and shared prosperity to a once and frequently war-torn continent. 

&gt;But
the architects of the euro, caught up in their project's sweep and romance, chose to
ignore the mundane difficulties a shared currency would predictably encounter -- to
ignore warnings, which were issued right from the beginning, that Europe lacked the
institutions needed to make a common currency workable. Instead, they engaged in magical
thinking, acting as if the nobility of their mission transcended such concerns.",0,1383929633,null,0,false,0,cd9qc8a,t3_1q5www,t1_cd9qc8a,t1_cd9pb07,null,1428740406,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

* The oldest human settlements found in Paris date back to 3800/4000 BC, making it one of the oldest city in Europe.

* Buildings facades in Paris have to be cleaned every 10 years by law. If you buy a building in central Paris you are also by law forced to keep the facades walls.

* The most expensive street to live in Paris (and France) is rue de Furstemberg in the 6th arrondissement. Price is about 21.000 euros / m². The last scene of [Martin Scorsese's Age of Innocence](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106226/?ref_=nv_sr_1) was shot in this street.

* There is a silent war between the left bank and the right bank of Paris. Rive gauche and rive droite. We don't know how it started, and we don't even know if there is anything to be gained. It's just territorial masturbation for the sake of it.

* It isn't uncommon to see bullet holes on some official buildings walls in Paris like the ministère des armées, souvenirs from WW2.

* Rue des Degrés is the shortest street in Paris, actually it's not even a street, it's a set of stairs 3 meters large and 5 meters long. There isn't even a door, no one lives there.  

* Paris street names can be hilarious: rue des mauvais garçons (bad boys street), rue poulet (chicken street), rue des Blancs Manteaux (white coats street), rue du Pas de la Mule (Mule's footstep street)...

* The center of paris is the old town, left mostly untouched by Napoleon III urbanist visionnaire the Baron Haussmann. There the streets are very narrow, often less than 3 meters wide. Before the spectacular urban input from Haussmann, Paris was entirely a web of very narrow medieval ill-ridden streets poorly lit. This contributed greatly to the successive french revolutions as it made it very easy for protesters to build thousands of barricades, while in the same time making it extremely difficult for the army to intervene. No cavalry charge, no artillery. 

* Napoleon III changed that, he gave Hausmann the charge of ""redesigning"" Paris. Aside from the new massive boulevards and avenues in lieu of the old streets, this redesign also included a new city wide water supply system that is still in use to this day, a gigantic system of sewers, new bridges, the opera Garnier and other public buildings, and the inclusion of outlying districts.
[Wikipedia entry on Hausmann's renovation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haussmann%27s_renovation_of_Paris)


* A couple decades after Haussmann's renovation Paris held two world fairs in 1889 and 1900. These gave Paris the Eiffel tower, le Sacré coeur and the first subway lines amongst other things. It also had a moving boardwalk above tree level inside the world fair. I think of these world fairs as disneyland meets steampunk.

true,goneouttosee,sicilia,null,"- Nel Queens! La gentrification non ha ancora raggiunto il mio quartiere, thankfully.

- I miei genitori non mi hanno insegnato l'italiano. Anzi. Non possono parlare italiano e parliamo tutti noi soltanto l'inglese in casa. Da piccola parlavo sia inglese coi miei che siciliano coi nonni i quali mi facevano da babysitter mentre i miei lavoravano. I nonni non hanno insegnato il siciliano ai miei genitori perche' in quell'epoca era una grande vergogna non imparare a parlare l'inglese se si era immigrati. Di conseguenza, hanno 'recuperato' il tempo perso ad insegnarlo a me e mio fratello da piccoli. :) I miei possono capire il siciliano e ogni tanto lo parliamo ma per il resto e' inglese. Durante la mia infanzia i miei volevano che io imparassi l'italiano, pero', e mi hanno portato alla Knights of Columbus (organizzazione italoamericana) qui' nel Queens per farlo. Spero sia stata chiara :P

- Beh, mancava la carta igienica, e me la dovevo portare da casa (!!!!). Roba assurda. I prof non c'erano quasi mai e se c'erano quasi quasi ti strangolavano se alzassi una mano per chiedere una spiegazione o per contribuire un'idea. Da noi tutta la lezione e' un invito per discutere. Poi non mi piaceva il fatto di dover studiare sempre da un libro e di non dover essere presente a tutte le lezioni. I prof non rispettavano i loro office hours e non c'erano quasi mai. Poi i baroni... Pero' devo dire che tutte e due le mie facolta' erano bellissime!

- YES YES YES YES YES YES YESSSSSSSSSSS. I am very sensitive to Italian-American stereotypes. Te lo dico perche' in inglese perche' in italiano non ha senso. Being Sicilian American means that everyone will make the inevitable 'mafia joke' to you, even teachers. Once on a school report, a teacher circled my name and wrote ""if your last name ends in a vowel, you're good with a trowel."" Disgusting. I hate the mafia and everything that has to do with it, and if I know an Italian American who says ""oooooh my family is in the mafia, it's awesome!"" I will walk away without a word and not be that person's friend, ever. 

- Si' che esiste! Ho mangiato il piatto di trippa con patate piu' buono che io abbia mai assaggiato li'. Pero' recentemente ci sono tanti immigrati albanesi li' (un po' come realmente succede in Italia!).

- Ci sono due facce della stessa medaglia. E' una cosa buona perche' vuol dire meno criminalita' ma e' una cosa veramente cattiva vedere i tuoi vicini di casa trasferirsi perche' non possono pagare piu' l'affitto. Poi con i vicini se ne va tutta la cultra 'vera' del quartiere e nel suo posto viene stabilito una comunita' omogenea priva di cultura (i cosiddetti hipsters). L'ho visto succedere a Brooklyn e mi fa spezzare il cuore. Il ceto medio a New York non esiste piu', il che mi rattrista cosi' tanto. :( Se puoi leggere l'inglese ti consiglio di leggere [questo](http://nycfuture.org/pdf/Reviving_the_Middle_Class_Dream_in_NYC.pdf).

- A Catania c'era caos. Non potevo andare in bici (non potevo attraversare la strada!). C'erano dei palazzi estramemente belli ma con graffiti addosso... insomma dei palazzi davvero monumentali che sono stati lasciati a sgretolarsi. Pero' il cibo era buonissimo e la gente siciliana e' senza paragone. Poi il mare e il sole... insomma, mozzafiato. A Reggio c'era lavoro, ordine e le strade erano leggermente piu' pulite di quelle di Catania. Poi una cosa curiosa che ho notato e' che, secondo me, la gente era piu' razzista in Emilia Romagna. Sara' perche' hanno piu' extracomunitari con cui interagire, ma li' erano davvero razzisti. Un mi vicino di casa mi diceva, ""MA NON ANDARE IN QUELLA VIA (Via Roma) DI NOTTE CHE LI CI SON GLI EXTRACOMUNITARIIII BEEEEHHH?"" ed io che son rimasta a bocca aperta perche' essendo americana (okay, con doppia cittadinanza, pero'..) sono extracomunitaria io! Invece a Catani mi sembra che abbiano accolto meglio gli immigrati, che parlano il catanese! E' uno sballo. A dir la verita' pero' il mio posto preferito in Italia e' stato Bolzano!

* il format e' in parte ispirato ad altri YouTuber, ma non particolarmente a Phil De Franco.

Pero' Ze Frank lo conosce meno gente, tutti conoscono De Franco, e allora si parla sempre di quello. Poi boh, io l'unica ispirazione che ci vedo e' ""parlo di news su YouTube"". Stop. E se vogliamo sta fissa che l'originalita' sia un pregio non ha molto senso, l'importante e' che sia una cosa fatta di qualita' e senza campare sulle spalle degli altri. Shy ci si spacca col lavoro che fa, fidati, non ruba niente a nessuno.
* i cut ogni 5 secondi li usano in molti, rende il discorso molto piu' veloce, scorrevole e meno noioso. Puo' piacere o non piacere, pero' lo usano molti degli YouTuber piu' capaci (i fratelli Green tanto per citare un esempio).
* che non sappia pronunciare un nickname mi sembra un po' un commento da puzza sotto al naso, giusto per criticare, pero' vabbe'
* con YouTube Italia si diventa poco famosi e ci si guadagnano soprattutto molti pochi soldi.

**The meanings of the flag for anyone that's interested:** 
 - The five blue shields represents the five moor kings defeated by the first King of Portugal, D. Afonso Henriques, at the Battle of Ourique.
 - The dots inside the blue shields represent the five wounds of Christ when crucified.
 - Counting the dots and doubling those five in the center, there are thirty dots that represents the coins Judas received for having betrayed Christ.
 - The seven castles represents the fortified cities D. Afonso Henriques conquered from the moors.
 - The globe represents the world discovered by the Portuguese navigators in the fifteen and sixteenth centuries.
 - The green strip is meant to symbolize the hope in the future and the red the blood of the nation’s heroes.",0,1383932503,null,0,false,0,cd9rl0y,t3_1q6td1,t1_cd9rl0y,t3_1q6td1,null,1428739826,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,Wild_Haggis_Hunter,null,null,"&gt; It is my understanding that the French are not big fans of Americans (not that I blame them really), is there anything I can do to avoid being treated poorly or taken advantage of for being American?

That's a common misconception : the French are fascinated by the American culture, the people, the gorgeous landscapes. They just happen to be very critical of your government's foreign policy, its theory of exceptionalism and its corporate culture. As long as you're not waving flag and pretending to bring freedom and enlightenment to the world, you'll find the French to be your closest friends. 

No, you won't be taken advantage of for being American either. Tourism is a serious business in France. Last year, we were still [the most visited country in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourism_rankings) with 83 million international tourist arrivals (the US are close second with... 67 million). It's accountable for 6% of the country's income (4% from French tourists traveling inside France and 2% from foreign tourists), and contributes significantly to the balance of payments. So there's a very low chance on you getting fleeced here. As elsewhere, try and stay away from the shops and restaurants the closest to touristic attractions, they cater to tour operators and rarely are the best/cheapest in town. 

Be wary of pickpockets though. The police does a good job in protecting the most tourist-crowded places but it can still happen. Once you're out of these hotspots or of the metro, the risk lowers significantly.

To avoid being treated poorly is not really hard. 

- Try to speak a few words in French. 
Say hello (""bonjour"") when entering a shop/restaurant/cafe, it's part of french courtoisie. 
Say you're sorry that you don't speak french (or not well enough) (""Je suis désolé, je ne parle pas français""). You'll find the french to be very understanding and helpful even if their grasp of English is less than optimal (the younger generation's way better at it btw). ""Merci beaucoup"" (thank you very much) is a magic word.

- Don't expect in cafes and restaurants the service you accustomed to in the US : it's a cultural thing. The french garçon is seen as your equal, you have to befriend him, not the other way around. Most of the time, waiters are nice and helpful. But it can also be a high pressure job : long shifts, language barrier and 2 to 3 times more tables to tend to than a US waiter has to. I recommend you read [that excellent post](http://www.myparistrips.com/frenchcultureandcustoms.html) that sums everything you need to know on the subject.

- try to avoid a casual dress : wearing kaki shorts and sloppy tennis shoes will quickly stand you out as a tourist. While the young French are increasingly wearing jeans and sneakers, their casual dress is still dressier than their American counterparts. You will blend in with the French more if you go with something casual but elegant in shops and museums but most importantly in restaurants. 

Given the many things to discover and enjoy in Paris 2.) cannot be answered without further information : how long do you plan on staying, do you prefer open air architecture or museums, walks or biking, etc..

In certi treni però ci sono dei sedili vicino alle porte che non hanno sedili di fronte, fantastici per evitare di distruggersi le gambe.

In alcuni vagoni ci sono dei gruppi di 3 sedili anche a metà, immagino dove prima c'era una divisione dello scomparto: spazio in più e non avete la porta che si apre in continuazione.

Il posto davanti o di fianco a voi può essere lasciato libero se mantenete uno sguardo sufficientemente truce o per caso siete neri/arabi.

Nessuna pietà per i non pendolari che lasciano la loro valigia nel corridoio: se non volessero farsela calciare dai passanti la metterebbero in uno spazio apposito.

Sulla banchina di alcune stazioni, fra il bordo e la linea gialla, sono presenti delle strisce bianche perpendicolari alla suddetta flavolinea: sono in corrispondenza delle giunzioni fra i vagoni quando il treno si ferma, potrete valutare spannometricamente dove posizionarvi per avere la porta davanti.

Molti delle borse/zaini sui sedili non sono segnaposto ma semplicemente la persona a fianco non ha voglia di toglierli e i passeggeri appena saliti non vogliono interagirvi; un portamento fiero e un ""è libero?"" deciso vi consegneranno un posto nel 98% dei casi.

I treni Vivalto sono puzzolenti catafalchi a due piani in cui avrete lo spazio pro capite di un pollo in batteria: se possibile sedetevi nei sedili singoli. Similmente, il treno precursore del Vivalto, che ha i sedili non separati dal bracciolo ma fatti a mo' di divanetto ha gli stessi problemi e in più il sedile riesce a ospitare al massimo una persona e mezzo.

http://www.thescottishfarmer.co.uk/news/deal-made-on-cap-reform.22645517

On Scottish farmers website their article says

&gt;The closest thing to an objective analysis of the deal on the table came from the National Farmers Union Scotland, which noted that, despite hopes that more might have been forthcoming, Scottish farming's share of the UK's CAP budget was to remain unchanged

&gt;...that will allow Scotland the ability couple up to 10 percent of its budget rather than 8 percent limit currently set.""That is a welcome flexibility and we must decide how best Scottish farming could target that uplift to benefit our industry. ""The slight uplift in the Pillar 2 funding comes as a relief, given that we were facing a budgetary cut. That should now take off some of the pressure for a transfer of funds from direct support into the rural development pot.""

http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/hot-topics/cap-reform/uk-government-rejects-scottish-calls-for-cap-budget-increase/60054.article

&gt;The Government has announced that the four UK regions will receive the same proportion of the €27.6 billion CAP budget over the next seven years as they currently receive.

&gt; Mr Lochhead has called for Scotland to be awarded all of what he said was a €220m increase to the UK budget granted on the back Scotland’s current low payments. However, following what it said was extensive consultation with the devolved administrations, the Government has concluded that the overall reduction in CAP (equating to 12.6 per cent in real terms over the 2014-2020 period) will be shared equally between the four UK administrations.

&gt;In what is being seen an as attempt to soften the blow for Scotland, the UK Government is remaining open to allowing Scotland to use some of the UK’s unused quota of coupled subsidy, subject to approval by the European Commission. If permitted, this could enable Scotland to go beyond its current limit upper limit of 8 per cent coupled subsidies under the reformed CAP.



So essentially the UK government kept to the current structure to make sure that the taxpayers pie is split evenly between all regions of the UK, with Scotland having the chance of getting some extra slices. The Scottish government wanted all of the pie and now they're throwing a hissy fit. The Scottish farmers are taking it on the chin.

Worst part of this? The SNP is clearly going against the grain of UKs policy towards CAP. The UK wants to cut CAP because it's taxpayers money used to subsidise 2% of the EU's workforce, while the SNP wants an increase.",0,1383942425,null,0,false,0,cd9vz0n,t3_1q70b5,t1_cd9vz0n,t3_1q70b5,null,1428736600,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19

Not only that but so far it has been shown anti-piracy measures hurt your customer base, essentially adding more reasons for piracy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's interesting, because it's pretty much exactly the experience I had all my life in France.

Unlike the author of the article, I didn't grow up in a more or less closed community of immigrants. I grew up in one the richest city of France, surrounded only by white catholics ""français de souche"" all my life, being in a top level catholic private school from first grade to the end of high school, and is currently in the best and most renown engineer school of the country (if you're french, you know the one).

Hell I don't even have a single non ""franco-français"" friend.

But I am a ""métisse"", one of my parent being french, the other one from a former french colony and educated in the french school system. And the foreign born parent decided to not pass any of his own culture, religion or whatever else on me, and to only speak to me in french. I don't know anything about this parent's life before its coming in France.

The result being that I don't have a double culture. I am cursed since my birth, because while I look foreign, I am culturally 100% french. Apart my skin color, there is exactly 0 differences between me and Marine le Pen 

BUT STILL. 

It doesn't matter that I worked my ass off all my fucking life to climb to the top of the social lader.

It doesn't matter that I have been there since my birth, and that my education is 100% french. 

It doesn't matter that islam/african culture/arabic culture/whatever-the-fuck-you-want-non-french-thing is as foreign to me that it is to your random icelandic man.

I am still treated as a fucking foreigner.

Seriously, you can't realise how much it hurts when someone tell you how well you did assimilate to french society.

I DIDN'T ASSIMILATE TO FRANCE, FRANCE MADE ME, YOU FUCKING BITCH !

Why should I always be reminded that I am not white, that the first time someone meet met they ask where I from ? 
And that when I say ""from France"" they ask ""yeah no, I mean, your REAL origin ?""

And even the cute little granny who try to be nice are insufferable : ""oooh that's lovely ! I went to your home country in holyday ! your sure know how to cook ! but don't you think you should move on to a more ""modern"" society ?"" MY. HOME. COUNTRY. IS. FRANCE.

I am tired to be presented as an ""good"" exemple of diversity...

And why should I always be THE ONE of my friends to be submitted to ""random"" control police, and how they will tell me aftermath  that they are positively surprised by the way I speak, i.e., way too good for a sandnigger/black nigger (yeah because being métisse while I sure look foreign they're never sure what I am exactly)

The worst being of course being purely and simply assaulted because I don't look enough french. In Paris ? No problem. But in the countryside... that's a whole other story.

You can't know how much it hurts to see that you'll never be french (despite the fact that your ONLY culture, your ONLY language are the french one) but only almost french. Doesn't matter how much you try.

Don't get me wrong. I love France. France is everything to me. But it seems that France doesn't want me. It probably is the most hurtful realisation of my life.

But. There actually is a place where I lived and studied during a year and where nobody gave a shit about how I look, or from where I come from. Where nobody ever found abnormal for me that I pretented to be french, when they heard my (I hope not so heavily) pronounced accent.
It's a place where I have been incredibly happy for a year, because for the first time in my life nobody treated me differently, although, ironically, it was in fact also the first time in my life that I REALLY was a foreigner.

And recently, I was given the opportunity to go back to this country, to study, but also to work... and live. 

And, well, there's no way I would have said that I would be glad to work and live elsewhere than in France if you were asking 15 years old me.

But now... Now it's different. Especially with the high score of the Front National.

And, ironically, the country where I plan to go is probably the western country who get the most shit in this subreddit.

This is scary for a few reasons . . steadily across Syria the Rebels are getting crushed on all Fronts. In the last week alone SAA has gained the major Strategic Rebel Strong-hold of Al-Safira in Aleppo and now this morning Breaking News from Syria was that the SAA have initiated their Surprise Aleppo offensive which has been predicted to happen for almost a year now.

They have taken Base 80 http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/08/us-syria-crisis-aleppo-idUSBRE9A70JN20131108 and many experts are looking at this offensive  as the definitive battle in the War so far. The SAA plan many believe is to split Aleppo into two which will decimate Rebel supply Lines and make Aleppo placed Rebels very weak during the coming harsh winter. 

If Aleppo is lost to the SAA, the War is all but officially over, possibly before 2015.

What I see happening now in videos like this and others is that the Rebels from the most extreme factions are placing the blame for losing on ""The West"" This includes primarily USA, France and UK with other countries as targets also, but those are the main 3. They see the in-action of ""The West"" to kill Assad as actually supporting the SAA.

This is VERY bad news since if/when the War does End .. there will be tens of thousands of very pissed off and radicalized ""Jihadists"" seeking vengeance on UK/France since they will be easy targets as many of these Jihadists already have passports for there. 

My Prediction  . . it is going to be getting really ugly soon.

It depends on the courses. Basically there are two overall types, I'd say. One type is ""everything specifically aimed at language proficiency"" (grammar, lexis, writing high-quality essays, giving high-quality presentations). The other type is what I'd call ""content courses"", with English as the official course language, but following a specific theme. In my English bachelor, every ""content course"" module always comes in two forms — for example, a hypothetical module ""P 5"" will always come in ""P 5.1"" and ""P 5.2"" — with P X.1 being a linguistics course and P X.2 being a literary course.

The language courses are ""meant for non-native speakers"" insofar as the intellectual needs of native speakers probably weren't accounted for when they were set up. The content courses, though, are definitely aimed at everyone, and I've had a few native speakers attending them with me (two from California in a linguistics course called ""Space in Language / The Language of Space"", and another one from Scotland, if I remember correctly, in the literary course ""Varieties of History in Victorian Fiction"").",0,1383947782,null,0,1383947981,0,cd9y8q1,t3_1q70x2,t1_cd9y8q1,t1_cd9xu6s,null,1428735524,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"Basically in most countries, radial ciruits are used. This is where you run a circuit from the consumer unit/fuse box to maybe one or two sockets, and then run it back. You repeat this process every time - maybe on some occasions you'll put the lights in the same room on one circuit, or maybe a couple of sockets that you know won't be used for heavy electronics, but by and large most of those circuits are protected individually by their own fuse/Residual Current Device. It takes up a fair amount of copper wire but it's a good way to do it - if something shorts the circuit, that breaker/RCD trips and that circuit goes dead.

In the UK, most homes were built in the expansion after the Second World War (at the same time that Britain designed its electrical plugs and sockets). They decided that there was a shortage of copper, so instead of using radial circuits, they would daisy chain all the lights on one floor, or all the sockets on one floor, on to one big high-current ring, and instead of having the fuses in a consumer unit, they would make sure that every device was protected by a fuse inside the plug (hence why British plugs are so big). For that reason, most homes in Britain only have a few circuits in them and only a few RCDs in their consumer unit - typically it's something like downstairs sockets, downstairs lights, upstairs sockets, upstairs lights, cooker, water heater, and maybe one other large appliance that needs its own. And that's it. It works well enough but there are a few problems inherent in that design: if there's a fault in the circuit, it's much harder to find it because everything would go dead at the same time and you'd need to go searching very hard (if the fault is in the appliance, it will just blow the fuse in the plug instead). Also, Britain could never concievably harmonise the plugs/sockets with the rest of Europe because there are no fuses in the plugs - almost every building in Britain would have to be completely rewired, which would be impossible. I've also heard some people criticise ring circuits because of the high currents that run through them, although to me they don't seem to be much higher than many other places in Europe so I'm not sure that's so important.

However, they are completely and utterly incompatable with almost every other standard. So there you go",0,1383951178,null,0,false,0,cd9zkk7,t3_1q650l,t1_cd9zkk7,t1_cd9xgli,null,1428734904,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

Which is why I think it's so stupid that this referendum is going ahead, especially since the Constitutional Court hasn't issued a decision on the legality of the question (and even moreso since it's being framed as a human rights issue).

Even though it's already enshrined in law, the discussion I've been having with friends is the fact that there is no good reason, whatever your beliefs, for this to be in the constitution. What purpose does that serve? To make sure that everyone knows that Croatia is super-duper Catholic and totally serious about it? Given all the economic problems and appalling levels of youth unemployment, hasn't the government got better things to do? And can someone tell the church to shut the fuck up and stop meddling in politics? This isn't their place. Fuck it makes me angry. They're even worse than the evangelicals in America.

EDIT: my other concern is that the referendum (which is getting international press) is making Croatians look like a bunch of backwards fuckwits who don't deserve to be in the EU.

Wenn du dir die Mühe gemacht hättest, den volkswirtschaftlichen Argumenten der eurokritischen Experten zu folgen, dann hättest du sehen können, daß ihrer Meinung nach die Krise der Eurozone zwangsläufig kommen musste. Und gekommen ist sie.

Die Theorie der Optimal Currency Area erklärt warum, und die der Public Choice, weswegen ein ökonomisch unsinniges Projekt trotzdem durchgezogen wurde.

Stattdessen polemisiert du gegen deutsche Niedriglöhne, Neoliberale, und Lohnstückkosten?

Denk mal nach: die ersten Warnungen kamen schon *in den späten Neunziger Jahren*, als von Niedriglöhnen in Deutschland noch keine Rede sein konnte. 

Und trotzdem sagten sie die Krise zutreffend vorher, ausgelöst durch wirtschaftliche, geldpolitische und fiskalische Disparitäten zwischen den Mitgliedsländern.

Von daher erscheint mir die Auseinandersetzung mit deinen Theorien unnötig.
